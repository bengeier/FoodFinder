{"text":"Disappointing first experience. I had high hopes but if a pizza place can't get the pizza right, I don't think it's worth returning.  The sauce was good...as was the outer crust, but the pizza itself was soggy in the middle and there was hardly any cheese on it.  The prices were...middle of the road. For the size, I felt they were a bit overpriced. Especially considering they were soggy."}
{"text":"We went a few weeks right after work  at 6 pm and were seated on lower main floor.   It is a big place.   I ordered the Margherita pizza and it is cooked in a real wood bring stove.    Some facby places use high end gaz stove but I really enjoy the trip texture created by the wood.   Service was Friendly and attentive.    Good open concept dining room and open kitchen  Good vibe and atomosphere once it is full .  Parking is easy on the side street if you can't find meter parking"}
{"text":"Ate here with the fam last night. Delicious pizza accompanied by stellar wine and a really cool atmosphere. Huge windows on the second floor lend a charming view of the streetcar barn. Momz and I split the Margherita Extra and Vegetarian pizzas. Both were outstanding. The zucchini in particular had a fine smokey flavour to it. Pops loved the anchovy pizza and made a wise call by adding cheese. The 2010 Sangiovese wine is gorgeous and reasonably priced at $40.   Our server was pleasant, attentive, and folksy. I felt a tad rushed to order as soon as we sat down, but I think he picked up the hint that we weren't in a rush ourselves and the pressure eased off.  I wasn't super keen on our reserved table being right next to the washroom entrance, but luckily the loos are well maintained so it wasn't a huge issue. I find the appetizer menu a bit lacking though - only four to choose from. Add a few more and I'd give the place five stars!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the Caesar salad. Was basically a head of lettuce with mayo. I suggest to the Chief that you try a traditional Caesar salad."}
{"text":"I walked in with my sister and baby last night after driving across the city to show her this place. Was greeted at the door nicely and guided to have a seat upstairs. My sister must have mentioned to the wait staff about getting a booster seat but I didn't hear. Then we walked over to two possible tables, one with 4 seats, one with 2. As we were talking about which to take, another server came and said very matter of factly we were going to block the fire exit if we sat at this specific table. So I said ok, we haven't even decided where we are sitting yet (like 'back off'). She didn't like this and raised her voice and very aggressively said, look, you CAN'T sit here with a high chair, it's going to block the fire exit!! (??? what horrible service!)  I got angry and said 'listen, I never said anything about a high chair, we haven't even sat down yet, and you are acting like a bitch!' (Yes I went too far with language, but her angry and aggressive attitude when you're expecting normal, good service set me off). Then she freaked! Yelling to other staff, pointing at me, 'she called me a bitch, she called me a bitch!!' I was embarrassed but maintained my ground when she came closer again and said, 'look you are supposed to be in the service business and you are acting very officious'. And she clearly didn't give a rats ass; saying, 'if I expected good service after this, I would have a problem'. We were outta there! What an embarrassing awful person, I was wrong to use the word bitch, but the rest is all on her, and I hope management can see her for the officious server she is and watch her behaviour. I was horrified and embarrassed. Felt so attacked, and for what?? We hadn't even sat down yet!"}
{"text":"Sure the pizza is good, but it's not pioneering or so extraordinary to command the high price charged. Their goal is clearly to extract the extra $10 or so from customers by offering a prix fixe priced only marginally higher than a pizza alone; this rather too calculated and grasping for me.  The tables are unnecessarily too close together and the waiters are given to evangelize about how authentic and unparalleled the food is as though it justifies the extortion. I won't go into the political propaganda posted in the men's room other than to say it makes me wonder if this place isn't more of a club house for its owners than a place of serious hospitality."}
{"text":"Had not been there in a while. Used to go there often but then stopped for a almost a year. I ordered the Calabrese. It was terrible. Dry, crust burnt (charred), crust not as good as before. not enough sauce (not to mention the sauce tasted bland), and worst of all they sprinkled parmigiana cheese over it instead of mozzarella. Terrible. Perhaps all of this is a cost saving measure but the pizza quality and taste has gone done.   I would have rated 2 stars but you guys charged me for tomato sauce on the side without telling me or without putting it on your menu- which is not even legal.  Sorry used to like your pizza not anymore."}
{"text":"This has been my favourite pizza place since it opened but I will never return. Saturday we went for our anniversary dinner. Foul tasting olives in the dirty martini lent a horrible taste to the drink. For $12 I should enjoy a drink and not be choking it down. The menu had changes and the pizza I liked was not on it. Although they offered to make it, I opted for one of the new ones but it was a blanco and I asked for tomato sauce. Without warning I was charged $2.50. For the tiniest bit of tomato sauce. My husband had the gluten free pizza and also without warning he was charged $3. None of the charred bits for which one pays a premium for this type of pizza were on his pizza crust. He paid over $20 for personal-sized pizza which was average at best. Overall we paid close to $100 for two pizzas, one martini and a glass of mediocre wine. Never again."}
{"text":"I went to Queen Margherita as a corporate outing and was very excited to try out this pizza spot (HUGE PIZZA LOVER). I was starving and still had quite a few people to wait for before ordering so I asked the male waiter if there were any appetizers available as there weren't any on the menu. Very rudely he snaps at me and says \"let me tell you how this menu works so you understand!\" .. I was taken back by this as to me it was a simple question. He then points to a chalk board BEHIND ME and explains the prix fix menu with the choice of appetizers on the chalk board.. BEHIND ME... As if I can see behind me or even know the chalk board is a menu.   I then asked for water, and I had asked for a straw.. Apparently that is too much since he snarled at me \"YOU NEED A STRAW FOR YOUR WATER?!\" .. I thought yes, that's why I asked for one but simply replied \"yes, please.\" By this time I was still very hungry and not impressed with this location but it was a corporate event and the option of leaving was not realistic.   Aside from the unnecessary attitude the food was really good and I absolutely loved the Vegetarian Pizza. The Citrus Salad they offered at the time was incredible and the Caramel Funnel Cake as dessert.. opted for Ice cream with it (additional 3$) which was half a scoop.. no point in asking the staff for anything else since they were unpleasant. Nonetheless the food was really good and I recommend you order ice cream with your funnel cake.. wasn't as pleasant when the half scoop was gone..   When it came to the bill, our waitress started to complain to my manager that she's been waiting on tables all day and is too \"crazy\" and the system is \"too much\" for her to separate the bills when this was requested at reservations..   All in all I just wish I had a better experience at this location since I love pizza, the food was incredible and the environment was indeed cozy. Because of this horrible service I probably won't return nor send people I know there.   Food good, service unacceptable."}
{"text":"Came in on a saturday evening, was quite busy but we were seated right away.  I went for the appetizer pizza and desert: eggplant fritti, margherita pizza, and chocolate torte. Which ended up being about 32$ with taxes. The eggplant fritti was very chewy and stringy... wasn't a fan. Pizza was great and huge. I asked for chili oil as well which was delicious.  Chocolate torte had great texture. It came with pickled strawberries, which threw me off.  Server was very attentive and helpful.  Cons: The space is so loud and echoey.  Sitting near the window was quite cold."}
{"text":"It's a really nice space. Quite different from Libretto or Terroni. Way more sedate--makes you feel relaxed. Now it was a slow Monday, but just the decor.  I like that they have snacks like olives and parmesan. Ok, if you order the parmesan, for $8 you get more parmesan than an $8 wedge at the grocery store. I am seriously not kidding. So, new trick, if you're out of parmesan, don't go to the store, go to Queen Margherita and order the parmesan snack to go. Soft crumbly delicious parmesan and lots of it.  My dinner companion was a vegetarian so we split one of the veggie pizza options. Seriously impressed that something without meat could taste that good. So, the net, pizza was completely equal in quality to a Libretto pizza (high praise). So tied for best in the city imho. It's true. Couldn't take a thing away from it.  Now dessert was another matter--affogato ... what was that, some econo-plastic-tub of ice cream with espresso on it. Mmmm.. no. Just, was not good. Needs attention.  Super friendly service, all around, and our server checked in at regular intervals without inserting herself into the table convo ... a unique skill, not widely appreciated.  Don't hesitate to go. But don't get the affogato."}
{"text":"Really good pizza here. I guess I didn't like that you couldn't create your own, so I am docking you a star.  I am not a picky eater, but let me make my own pizza!"}
{"text":"We waited 20 minutes for our table, despite having a reservation.  We waited 10 minutes for our menus.  The two empty beer bottles and emply cocktail glasses sat empty on our table for half an hour.  The server removed the beer bottles when my husband asked her to, but left the empty cocktail glasses (all this after having been served more drinks).  The appetizers were enjoyable, and the pizza was quite yummy. But anything would be good after having waited as long as we did. Our server was friendly but far from attentive.  We had to ask for water. Twice. ?  When water was delivered by our server she filled two of the four glasses at the table, and disappeared.  10 minutes later when she blew by us, my husband asked again for water for the other two people at the table.  Water then appeared.  At the end of the mains, the bus girl interrupted my conversation to ask me to pass her my side plate, instead of walking around the table and picking it up herself.  \"Dessert will be right up\" the server announced. 15 minutes later our dessert arrived.  The Gelato had melted, half liquid in the glass cup, I thought of asking for a straw. I imagined it had to sit on a counter near a hot pizza oven until our server remembered to pick it up and deliver.  But I was wrong, as our server pointed out, it was because the hot glass cups were taken right from the dishwasher.  Ohhhhhhh! Why didn't you just say so? You will probably enjoy your pizza at this place, but Queen Margherita is mediocre at best.  Be prepared to wait for everything and don't let the Leslieville hype get to you or you'll be super disappointed.    I don't remember the last time I experienced such lousy service. Nice room though, that I'll give them."}
{"text":"After a late night, we decided to hit Queen MArgherita, and were delighted to find a very well-priced dinner combo menu.  That, and the pizza was great (our friendly waiter said it is better in Napoli).    now that I visited Napoli, I can say yes, it is a bit better, but QMP is quite excellent!"}
{"text":"Queen Margherita offers a selection of classic Italian pizzas.  The staff is very kind and helpful and the pizza tastes quite authentic.  They offer very affordable fix prix menus - 3 course for $25-$28.  Their nutella dessert is good if you like chocolate mousse.  I wish they changed the dessert menu a little more often.    One of our friends wanted to order an appetizer with her pizza.  There's no option to just order pizza and dessert or pizza and appetizer.  You either get the 3 course menu, or the pizza, which is disappointing.  There isn't much parking available on the street.  My favourite pizza is the margherita,  The restaurant has a good vibe - not too pretentious or casual."}
{"text":"Wow, you are all so generous with your ratings of this place! I went for the first time ( for my birthday) we had a reservation for 7:30pm and waited until 8:30 to be seated!! (by the way this was a Sunday) The guy who was seating everyone kept saying another 5 minutes....... he didn't offer to seat us at the bar, we had to stand there for an hour!!!  Once we were finally taken upstairs and seated our waitress took our drink requests. I asked for a beer she brought it with no glass and i had to ask for one?????? why I'm not at home!!! I didn't think the pizza was really anything worth going back for and to be honest I wouldn't go back.   It's really not worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Excellent local pizza joint. Left my neighbourhood for this place and definitely worth the drive (albeit short). Tired of busy pizza Libretto Danforth. Great neighbourhood feel- lots of neighbourhood support. Service attentive. Great open concept. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Cool layout with the main restaurant subterranean. Authentic Naples inspired pie with chewy, yet nicely crisp crust. The 2 or 3 appetizers tasted were underwhelming, but fresh ingredients shined throughout."}
{"text":"The fixed price menu is awesome!  my last few visits I've gotten the same thing: grilled kale salad, the Diavola,  lemon cheesecake with pistachio and honey.     oh yeah, and either an Allo Campagnola or Birdman to take home.   Kale salad : enormous, hearty and delicious.  I've taken leftover salad home and it's stood up to wilting just fine.   Diavola : this has been my go to pizza since my first visit.  my last trip a friend also ordered this and the difference in our toppings was pretty remarkable.  I had a few scant olives while his was teeming.  I wouldn't have taken exception to mine had I not seen how robust his toppings were.  even still, down the hatch it went!  Lemon Pistachio Cheesecake: the bomb!  I mean - you won't like it, opt for something else and leave it to me to order :P   service is quick and friendly. the top floor is a little loud and congested but the main level is more chill.    I plan on making this trip many, many more times.."}
{"text":"Excellent Pizza Join!!! The margherita pizza is perfectly baked in a wood burning oven, the appetizers are very tasty. The atmosphere is great for adults as well as families with young kids alike. If you are on the east end of town and want an authentic pizza place you must try queen margherita."}
{"text":"I just ate Calabrese take out and it was not good. Crust flavor is good but burnt. Calabrese salami quality was bad. We added mozzarella cheese as server suggested that there is only pamarsan  cheese on it. Honestly I don't care about extra charge when it comes  to good eats but it was not enough mozzarella for $3 . Server also forgot to put chili oil that we asked for. Waste of 26 bucks including tip. I have better pizzas so many places. Not recommend!"}
{"text":"After having a great experience at the East-end location about a year ago, I was excited to learn that Queen Margherita had a new West-end outpost not far from my apartment.   Both my dinner companion and I ordered the Margherita pizza with fior di latte and fresh basil as well as our own glasses of wine. Their wine list is great.   Unfortunately the pizza at the Dundas location wasn't as stellar as I remember it being at the East end location. This time around, the crust seemed to be more doughy. I'm not sure if it was an off-night at Dundas or if it is always like this, because I remember being blown away by the pizza during my East-end visit and was just \"meh\" about it this time around.   The vibe is super relaxed and you can actually have a conversation without screaming at each other (yay!).   The service was fantastic: 5 stars for their loveliness.   It should be happily noted that they take reservations. Excellent place to dine out for groups.   Overall, Queen Margherita's Dundas location is a solid, a-okay pizza spot."}
{"text":"More like Queen Meh-guerita. It was pretty good pizza in a really shitty sterile overly lit room. Go to Pizza Libretto."}
{"text":"I LOVE Queen Margherita.  Been a long time, loyal customer.  Great atmosphere.  Superb service - my friend accidently knocked her knife that lay under a slice of her freshly-served pizza and the slice went flying off the table.  The waiter came over, cleaned up our mess and offered to make her a new pizza.  Unbelievable.  Another time, I shared their Pre-Fix Menu with a friend.  Great appetizers! Very generous menu, could not imagine finishing that on my own. Take out is quick and easy too.  Pros.  So lucky it's so close by!   Thanks QMP!"}
{"text":"Food is a little on the pricey side for pizza, but that being said, it is delicious!  At most places, when you order a salad, you get a pitiful small bowl of salad. Here, you actually get a decent portion of salad to help fill you up.   If you're not sure which of the pizzas to pick, you should definitely try the La Scala pizza if you like pulled pork.   The ambience is more on the industrial side being in an old brick building, so if you're into that, its nice."}
{"text":"Went the other night for a meal with my boyfriend. It was (as a lot of others have already said) good, but not great. I got the margherita and he got the vegetarian and we each had half and half. It was kind of just, whatever, tasted fine, not too much cheese or taste.   I kind of don't understand going for gourmet pizza at a restaurant. Paying $20 for a personal pan pizza when you could get an XL from delivery for that amount... And frankly the kind of pizza that you get at gourmet places is so hit and miss. With QMP, it was just alright. So I think to myself... If they made up a small little Dominos Pizza (my favorite!) and served it to me with the same atmosphere and price and whatever, what I would think of that! Get your thinking cap on...  So we were seated in the lower portion, and it was just fine! Still quaint and by the bar and window. However, our waitress came up to us and said \"hey\" or \"hi\" or whatever, a single greeting and stood there and waited. It was actually kind of awkward. Usually when servers come up to you they say stuff like \"hi, what can i get for you?\" \"can i get you a drink to start off?\" or something. But this time it was just a \"hey\" and wait. So I said... \"ummmm... so I guess for drink I'll have this and for pizza i'll have this.\" So awkward!   And I heard her do it to the couple beside us as well. They asked about the Prix Fixe Menu and she said to them all options are on the chalkboard that (from where they were seated) was not visible. On top of that, two of the couples seated on either side of us (since service is so quick, we had 2 sets of people.. some finishing, then some coming in) both commented on how bad the service was as they were settling up with the bill and tip. I mean, good on them to not complain to her face, but I recognized it too... along with everyone else in there! One last thing-- she came up to the couple beside us with some food and they said \"oh we didnt order it\" and she spoke to herself like \"ohh hmm i wonder who did t hen.... hmm are you sure? i was almost positive...\"  haha OK! Anyways, I wouldn't go back. Just mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"Simply the most pure and perfect pizza in the city, a treasure in the east end, which is suprisingly busy given a tough location. But worth it. The 25 dollar prix fixe is a steal, with great desserts and fun starters flanking the incredible pizzas.  I find myself drawn here weekly, sometimes alone and at the Bar, enjoying spot on service, speed that is  pretty decent, and a great list of wines at good price points."}
{"text":"Amazing food, accommodating service,  great atmosphere. What more can you ask for?  Try the pork belly pizza and don't miss the delicious pistachio cheesecake. I promise you won't regret it. Great place for a date or just a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"I went here tonight and I thought the pizza was very boring. The flavours were not sharp or delicious enough and I thought it was a little bland. I was really disappointed with the crust. I guess I am just not a fan of Neapolitan style pizza, which was gooey, soogy, soft and had no flavour.  Parts of the pizza were too thick and parts were too thin and it drooped in the middle. The cheese on the Margherita pizza I would say was stingey, definitely not enough cheese and the Mattoe mushroom pizza needed more salt or something. I prefer pizza that has a thin crispy/crunchy crust with enough cheese on it what makes you smile with cheese love when you have a mouthful. I also think the tomato sauce has to be robustful and I have nothing good to say about Queen Margherita Pizza sauce, it was just not memorable.   I ate the whole pizza because I was hungry and I didn't hate it but I didn't love it. I will not be returning here. Also who cares if a style of pizza is authenic or not if it doesn't taste good?    If anyone knows of a pizza place that makes pizzas like how I described, please let me know!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza's I've had in Toronto. I like it so much that just chewing on the dough and tasting the tomato sauce is exciting to me!  Service is typically ok. Sit upstairs as this is the most beautiful part of the restaurant. Do bring a sweater (outside of the summer) as I find it gets quite cold up there."}
{"text":"So I went to this place with high expectations. How could you not when a place has \"Margherita Pizza\" in its name?!  So we arrived last minute at 830pm on a wednesday and were promptly seated in the \"dining\" area on the second floor. When you first enter, it looks like an irish pub, but as you go up to the second floor, it becomes a cozy trendy resto.  So we are seated and immediately, our waitress comes to take our drink orders. We were told there is a prix fixed menu for 27$ which includes one of the four apetizers and a dessert. Not bad so we thought....we elected to order the roasted tomato caprese salad, the romaine lettuce with fennel, raddichio, and walnuts, and the prosciutto w bread. We also ordered the buffalo mozarella margherita pizza to share, how could we go wrong?!....  So the apetizers arrive, the roasted tomatoes were tasty, albeit small and there were only two of them, but to my disappointment, the buffalo mozarella had hardened and was hard to chew as it tasted the consistency of rubber. The sauce was good but the portion small. The romaine lettuce salad was very fresh, with crisp ingredients, but the entire thing was tossed in a heavy cream sauce - my boyfriend said it reminded him of a waldorf salad. \"Is this italian?\"...was the first thing going through my mind. The prosciutto was underwhelming. The taste was mediocre and the bread that it was served with as cold and ordinary. Not crisp, warm, or extremely fresh. The whole thing was drizzled with some olive oil, but that made no impact whatsoever.   So onto the main meal, as the pizza came, I anticipated greatness...akin what julia roberts felt in eat love and pray as she took a bite into a margharita pizza. To my big dissappointment, the buffalo mozarella cheese was rubbery and not fresh tasting. The rest of the toppings were ok...tomato sauce and fresh basil. The crust was good. Thin, but unflavorful...tasted like flatbread. When you expect a bite of heaven in your mouth and a religious exprience as you devoure your meal, you can be easily disappointed as you feel like you are eating just yet another flat bread coated with sauce and cheese. The crust was thin yes, but there was nothing flavorful or outstanding about this pizza.   We opted for the gelato ice cream with a shot of coffee. It was a-ok. Our bill with a coke came to 65$ with tax and tip. It was the most underwhelming meals I've ever had at an italian resto. They didn't even have oliver oil or balsamic vinegat at the table, and the hot chili peppers condiments were just \"ok\". Not inspiring enough that you'd want to buy some and take home as you might any other good italian resto.  The ambiance and service however was impeccable. The place was cozy, modern, bright, tastefully decorated, and the staff was friendly, polite, and attentive. It was a great date place ambiance. Not sure I would go back when I can get better pizza at Pizzaillo. Sad but true."}
{"text":"4.5/5! This is one of the best pizza places in the city because they take reservations, there is lots of space, it is good for groups, fantastic service & amazing pizza! We went in a group of 4, ordered different pizzas and shared a slice of each- which worked out perfectly. I recommend the Margherita, Diavola (esp those that like spice), alla campagnolo and my favourite of them all: Giovanna. Must try!"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere (very New York loft) great service and the food was awesome. I had the Margherita Extra and it was fantastic - best Margherita Pizza I've had in a long time! Fresh and flavourful - especially if you LOVE sweet tomatoes.  The customer service was customer centric!  We were late leaving our table by about 15minutes - with a party of 10 waiting and the manager was very gracious about reminding us of the other party. She also very apologetic she had to move us at all when we hadn't received our desserts and gave us all free desserts to take home.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Just the worst!  First off the food. If you want a regular, North American pizza this is not the place for you. Sparse cheese and an intensely sweet sauce create a experience that at best could be call surprising and at worst, repulsive. Their \"Romaine\" salad, which I was assured by the serve was the same as a caesar was most assuredly not a Caesar. The lettuce was brown and wilted and the dressing was overly creamy with a horrible aftertaste that will stay with you for days and make you cringe at the memory.  Now the service. If you expect to be treated like a human being do not go to this restaurant. The server seems irritated that my party was there, was short and terse with her answers and threw plates down with a contempt that made me think we insulted her just by sitting down. The Caesar salad was ordered as a main by one of our group and was brought to the table a full 15min before the rest of the meal. When asked about why it was not served at the same time we were simply told that we could wait so one party member had to sit there with a salad in front of them while waiting.  Do yourself a favour and go anywhere else if you want pizza. You'll thank me for it."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere. The upstairs room is great for an evening with friends. The pizza was OK, I won't be rushing back for that, but I will try the other specials on the menu. The service was fine. Make sure to book, it's a busy place."}
{"text":"Okay. The rumours are true. Reservations don't always work out as planned. But if you are patient everything will be okay. Its a busy place. I didn't even realize that they had taken over the big space above the coffee shop and it was still packed. The space is also very cool and definately first date material for all the single guys like myself.  Let's get to the food. I have to say the highlight of the night wasn't even the pizza but the hot sauce which was out of this world. Possibly from Mars. Just for this reason I'm giving this spot a 4. Now to the pizzas. I was out with my Pizza club which meets monthly and checks out different spots in the Toronto area.  Now to the Pizzas I have to admit the pizza was pretty tasty. Being the pizza club we tried five different pizzas. Unfortunately I was off to the Horseshoe Tavern early to catch Joy Formidable so only had time to taste 3 of the pizzas. Margherita, Vegetarian, and another one that has left my memory.  The Upside. Dough was fantastic and the size of the actual Pizza was perfect.  The Downside: Not much Sauce, very little cheese and toppings were sparse. The remedy for this was the hot sauce that made for a great emergency topping.  Service was great. So which Pizza was the best you ask? I'll go with the surprise winner of the Hot Sauce."}
{"text":"We went for Valentine's day without a reservation thinking that the  wait will be long. We did not have to wait for a table and the food was fast an really good like it always is.  The place is usually very noisy but for valentines the music was softer and the ambiance calm, but I can't say romantic. We had a delicious dinner and good service."}
{"text":"On the heels of my Italy trip, my sis and I decide to try the new Leslieville pizza resto that has been the new talk of Toronto. And... as Dean Martin's famous lyrics go \"When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's Amore... The casual but comfortable exposed brick building is quite welcoming and the fact that they take reservations, one up's a restaurant in the West end famed for their pizza as well.  We actually didn't think to make reservations on a Tuesday night and needed to wait in the bar for about half an hour. But we were happy with our glasses of prosecco and catching up as the restaurant was buzzing with energy and filled with hungry pizza goers.  We both chose the prix fixed which was our choice of a starter (a caesar salad, or a prosciutto with orange slices, shaved parmasean on greens and choice of pizza and then dessert for $25.) We absolutely had to try the restaurant's namesake pizza margherita and a quattro fromaggio pizza. The thin crust on our pizzas were delicioso, and came pre-sliced (a bit of a surprise), and came out not too crunchy which is truly the authentic italian style. The portion was good for an entree; we had 4 hearty slices to eat through.  We were told that a pizza slice should have a sag factor and not stick out like cardboard when held out. The pizza should also resemble a leopard as pockets should be burnt and others should be golden as the pizza oven is extremely hot!!  .\"'xcusa me, can't you see, back in old Napoli, that's amore!\""}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past year and it's always been great. Love their 3 course special for $27. When they ran out of the dessert a few of us wanted they asked what they could offer us instead. Great service! I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"As a very brief update to my prior essay, I went back here a few weeks ago and had a good but not great experience. I went here with 6 people and would say that the crusts on all of our pizzas were slightly underdone.   In my opinion the best part of Neapolitan pizzas is the perfectly blistered smokey crust, so when I see one with barely a tasty black freckle I can't help but be disappointed.   Keeping things in perspective however the pizza was still very good and I have two great experiences to this one less than great experience so I'm still a fan.   Overall I would give my last visit a 3.5."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh, decent sized pizzas. Good drink selection. Decent service.  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"We have been coming to this place consistently for the past 2 years and have never been dissapointed. The price is fair, the service is great, the drinks are very diluted which makes them very tasty.  The pizzas are somewhat large, thin-crust and cooked in a stone oven (yay).  You can reserve for big groups too which makes it a very convenient place. Overall I consider this place as the best Pizzeria in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Long lines, crowded foyer, so/so service, mediocre pizza. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Best kind of pizza you can get in Toronto! they make it in a gigantic stone top oven. just wish they would be careful not to sometimes burn the edges of the pizza, or the part of the doe/cheese that bubbles up...  other than that the place is fantastic. the chilli oil is great on the pizza and garlic aioli makes for a perfect dip! Never tried the deserts but they look super good when their carrying it out from the kitchen"}
{"text":"Im here once a week! Pizza's are to die for! its a must cant go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Pizza had great flavor but the option to make your own with all the ingredients would have been preferred.  Prices high for this area and size pizza."}
{"text":"The Prixe Fixe is a great deal for excellent food! In my opinion the pizza is better than Pizzeria Libretto's and has a nicer laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've tasted only two pizzas here so I'm reserving the right to cut back my rating - however, I am a big fan of the thin, slightly chewy but at the same time tender crust.  Toppings are generous enough and hot peppers in oil are a great addition of you order a simpler pizza as many on the menu are.  The prix fixe menu is a bit tricky and lures you into adding a salad and small dessert for $7 or $8 more.  Unless you're very hungry you could share a prix fixe with a date and that would be great value - dinner for two for $25 plus beverages.  I watched other couples ordering their own pizzas only to have plenty to take home.  For a thin crust pizza this place dominates Lil' Baci."}
{"text":"My fave pizza in the city. Prefer to Pizza Libretto and Via Mercanti. Doughy crust, not too crisp. Fresh tomato sauce.  Nutella mousse does me every time.  Huge space."}
{"text":"We went to QMP after reading about it in Toronto Life.  Venue: We got a table on the 2nd floor so it was pleasant and bright. The place is casual and relaxed. Just perfect for a weekend lunch.  Food: We had the prix fixe lunch costing $25. The Pizza Napolitano and Giovanni pizza were ok. The carpaccio is certainly good. Dessert was also satisfying.   This is a good pizzeria to go to if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city... at least the East end! I know Pizza Libretto is amazing too. Diavola - tomato sauce, fior di latte cheese, hot sausage and hot peppers and the Margherita are my favorite pizzas. I live in the beach and eat here a lot - 6 times in one month - including take-out. I just got back from Rome and found myself preferring QMP to any of the pizzas I had in Italy... bold statement I know, but what can I say... QMP is addictive pizza. The venue is self is a great lofty space, with huge windows and a cool bar area on the first floor. Early dinner has been really good for us as we take our 4 month old daughter with us. Very baby friendly restaurant. The staff is great."}
{"text":"The meal was great. We had the Gio Oldschool and Roberto Scallopini pizzas. The Gio was a tomato based pizza and crust and toppings were perfect. Our favorite of the two was the Roberto...AKA The Birdman pizza. Crust was perfectly crunchy but yet light and airy. The garlic aioli and crunchy kale and sunflower seeds complimented each other perfectly, with a little sun dried tomato to add some tangy sweetness. It was delicious.  The wine was great and the service equally as great. Overall a perfect place to eat."}
{"text":"Like most authentic Italian fare, this is going to be about using a small quantity of high quality ingrediants, sparingly.   For those looking for a NY-style pizza, with gooey cheeses and toppings, look elsewhere.  It's all about the crust and this place certainly delivers. Very nice thin crust, perfect balance between crisp and chewy.  I went with the cheeseless Napolitano, featuring anchovies and capers, while my wife had the mushroom pizza.  Both enjoyed ours and had trouble finishing.  We both ordered the prix fixe menu, which included a choice of salad to start and choice of dessert.  Unless you're really hungry, I'd say the pizza is probably sufficient but at a $25 for any pizza and choice of salad and dessert, it's quite a great deal.  Wine list features a nice price range of approachable Italian reds and whites.  Great addition to the neighbourhood. Only complaint is that it has likely ruined me for other pizzas, which I may have previously enjoyed well enough but will no longer measure up. Other notes....On the space itself...didn't realize it was two levels, with a set of stairs just to the right of the main entrance/bar area leading to the main seating area, with two large banks of windows.  there's a kind of spare, cleaned up former industrial site feel to the room which suits the 'hood and provides some character. Service was very good, almost surprisingly so, given how many tables and people our waiter was juggling. Manager made a point to walk around and say hello, ensure everything was fine. As another reviewer noted, the place is very well run even though it has only been opened a couple of months. They seem to have by-passed the growing pains stage.  Hope it stays that way as I'm looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"I love me some carbs!!!!!  Being a big fan of Libretto but hate the wait, this place is perfect. I discovered it completely by random. From the outside it looks like it's closed. But don't let the tiny store front fool you, the place is huge inside! I started going to a yoga studio in the same building and after one of my evening classes I stumbled in here cause I was STARVING. I sat at the bar and ordered the Giovanni (pork belly with lots and lots of arugula) and devoured it. I loved the home made chili oil with real chopped chilies inside, it adds the perfect kick to their delicious pizza. I then went on to have a chocolate tiramisu with a latte, and it did not disappoint.  My favourite part of the pizza was the crust. I think that was the most delicious crust I've ever had. it's crunchy and chewy with the right amount of flavour. The staff there were all really friendly and cheerful. I got to chat with them quit a bit since I was eating alone.   I then tried a few other pizzas on their menu (including the Marghrita) in the weeks after and loved them all! I think this is the perfect place offset all my hard work at yoga! :P"}
{"text":"Though the pizza ranks tops in Toronto, the service and wait times make Queen Margherita a dismal experience. After waiting an hour for our mains (it's pizza for fucksakes) and receiving inattentive service, I don't think I will be back. I've done this dance 3 times now, and every time the same thing. Back to Liberato where at least the hospitality matches the food."}
{"text":"Thin crusted Italian pizza. Huge portions. I shared one pizza w my friend and I could only eat two slices. Limited wine selection. Huge place inside and great ambiance ... altho I did get quite distracted with so many people walking around in the open space."}
{"text":"I should probably take a star away because it takes soooo long to get an entree here when it's busy. But the food is soooo good that I'm gonna let it pass. Soooo good."}
{"text":"There's been a proliferation of pizza places in Toronto. QM is in the middle of the pack. The dough is OK, these days I'm looking for something special, springy with a distinct taste. I was left without much of an impression at all.   The pizza varieties are pretty basic, and that's ok if the ingredients are perfect. Yet still on the whole I felt it was a bit bland - I've had both the margherita and a very meat based one.  The one part that left me puzzled on both times I've been was.... the temperature. Both times the pizza came out rather cool. How is that?? I can see the oven in the back!  It's not bad, just unexceptional, and I'm not in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good authentic pizza well-made at least 50-75% of the time. Can be a little hit and miss.  I'm a Pizza Margerita guy and whenever they forget half the cheese it makes me unhappy. Honestly don't make me leave the house and come here and drop cash for an under-decorated Naan bread. Why is making a decently-dressed pizza so hard? Other friends have noted feeling ripped off by some Napoli-style Pizza places - and they WILL avoid you in future so don't be cheap with the stuff, it's bad for business.  I'm not crazy about the awkward ambiance at the Queen/Greenwood location but I'd probably care less if the pizza blew me away. It usually doesn't. It's still a good 2nd choice to Libretto on Danforth, and far better than Via Mercanti at either location.  First-World problems LOL."}
{"text":"Libretto may rule the pizzaland of Ossington, but Queen M. Pizza definitely rules the east!   QMP took me by surprise. I love Libretto. I still love Libretto. But, QMP, I was impressed.   The atmosphere at QMP is more casual... The menu is simple (not quite as adventurous as Libretto)... But damn, you make a good pizza.  1) Reservations They actually take reservations!  Hooray! This place was packed, packed, packed on a Friday night.  Even though we had to wait a bit for our table (15 mins), I never felt ignored. I was constantly acknowledged by the owner and hostess.  2) Set Menu for $25:  Appetizer, pizza, and dessert! It's a great deal!  *Appetizer* Antipasta platter: It was alright... completely comparable to the self-serve antipasta station at Longo's.  *Pizza* Napoletana: Anchovies, capers, black olives, tomatoes.  Holy salt overload!  Capers.  Damn you.  Giovanni: Prosciutto, arugula,  tomatoes.   This pizza was fantastic!!!  The fresh arugula made our carby meal feel a bit more balanced.     For both pizzas, I found the crust chewy but slightly undercooked. The middle of the pizza was a bit soggy.  *Dessert* The pumpkin creme brule is not creme brule. It's not.  Don't pretend it is. It's pumpkin pudding with crispy sugar bits. But it was still yummy, like the filling of a pumpkin pie in a  ramekin. =)  One thing I didn't like is that there is no paper menu available for the wine/drink list.  Unless you are seated on the lower level (where the lists are written on chalk boards), you have to ask.  When I asked the waitress about the wine list, she responded \"Oh! It's all in my head\". ...Yeah... I just ordered a mojito.  Also, I don't like their t-shirts.  Other than that, QMP is a great casual spot for pizza! =)"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I've never been to Italy so...I have no clue how Italian pizza taste like. However, if these guys represent true Italian pizza, I'd be so disappointed. Let's just say that none of them had memorable taste. Everything was bland. Their tomato sauce was so bland and they were extremely stingy with toppings.  Not giving one star because at least, toppings tasted fresh  Tried Alla Campagnolo, The Dominator, Gio Oldschool and La Scala.  alla campagnolo $19 - (Mushrooms, Asiago, Garlic, Goat Cheese, Oregano) - Literally, couldn't taste asiago, garlic and oregano. I could only taste mushrooms and goat cheese.  Might as well call it a goat cheese mushroom pizza.  The Dominator $20 - (Fennel Sausage, Rapini, Smoked Mozzarella, Fried Chili Oil)  - mashed the hell out of Fennel sausage to save their precious toppings. The worst part is that it had bland tomato sauce. literally tasteless  Gio Oldschool $20 - (Fior di Latte, Cherry Tomato, Prosciutto di Parma, Arugula)  - probably the best one. What saved this pizza was prosciutto di parma but it alone is a tasty ham so really, nothing to write home about.   La Scala $20- (Fior di Latte, Sweet Pork Belly, Asiago, Red Onion, Salmoriglio, Hot Peppers, Arugula)  - probably the 2nd best one. Simply saying this because it was spicy. I love spicy but that's not saying much.  After trying out their pizza, I got an impression that their pizza is extremely overpriced. Won't be a returning customer. RIP"}
{"text":"The setup of QMP is cool. I like how the dining area was located below the waiting area and had a good view of the pizza ovens.  Also, white pizza! It's hard to find white pizza and I've been looking for it since I returned from Italy. Tasty pizza, nice atmosphere and good service."}
{"text":"What makes the pizza here so good? It's made in the Italian way, perfected over centuries as the street food of the poor, the edible equivalent of the opera, also once a poor person's entertainment.    The base is made by hand in the kitchen, not by machine in a food service warehouse. It takes two days to make the dough so it ferments properly, thereby violating the \"money-making first\" rule of quick turnover, which has killed all fermenting in the mainstream food industry.       The base is thin, good for people watching waistlines, and baked in a woodfired oven for under two minutes so the fresh ingredients aren't over-cooked. And the cheese is made-to-order for the restaurant, fresh from Ontario, not bulk cheese bought cheap from the milk pool.          Alas, pizza came to North America during the 1950s, before countries became protectionist about their food culture, so junkfood operators are able to call their adulterated version pizza. An organization to protect the pizza did not develop until the 1980s, when the trend was too far gone.        I deal with efforts to defend local foods -- the products of local cultures and local places that should be protected from highjacking if the name is to be used -- in my book, The No-Nonsense Guide to World Food.      It's not just yeast that gives a rise to the pizza dough; it's an entire culture and a method, now celebrated by the Slow Food movement, born, of all places, in Italy."}
{"text":"Best Italian place in the cit for sure. The Caprese Salad wad just sublime. Wonderful and fantastic.  The fact that it was serve with freshly baked foccachias. IT was the best authentic italian meal I had. The Pizza was very good too of course , their speciality! I've seen Octopus on the menu. I am sure it's awesome!  Last but not least, the Service, perfect and authentic , like the food! Looking forward to go back really soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious but a little pricey. 30$ for an appetizer, pizza and dessert or approximately 18-20$ for a pizza.   I have visited QMP a few times on Dundas St. W. and in the Beaches and I have enjoyed the food consistently.   I recommend the zucchini fritters (Frito Misti) and \"mozzarella pulled in house\" for appetizers. The fritters were light and crispy and very nice. The mozzarella was chewy and delicious and came with bread, crackers and chutney.   For pizza, I liked the Cinque Stagione (Bell peppers, Spicy Zucchini, Fior di Latte, Garlic, Ricotta Salata, Truffle Oil, Black Pepper) and the Alla Campagnolo (Mushrooms, Asiago, Garlic, Goat Cheese, Oregano). The Cinque Stagione is quite mild-flavoured, letting the veggies be the stars but I wished that the zucchini had been actually spicy. The Alla Campagnolo is much bolder from the garlic and the mushrooms and I really enjoyed it. I really like the chewy floppy crust that gets crisp in some spots.   I cannot remember the desserts as standing out, so I will pay closer attention on my next visit to QMP!"}
{"text":"I order two pizzas to-go on Fathers Day, The basic Tomato-Cheese-Basil Marghertia Pizza and the Fungi (like other reviewer mentioned just plain old white mushrooms)...Took  about 15 minutes after they bragged about it taking 90 seconds.  price...$34.00  The interioir of the restaurant is lofty and the wood burning pizza oven at the back of the upper hall is quite majestic.  The entrance downstairs is sort of a foyer/bar area with a couple of tables, and stools against the window.   Not overly private and I bet come winter quite chilly.  Loved the pizza dough, i didn't find it heavy.  It was thin but had that chew on it I love (some people hate that).  Both Pizzas were a bit bland they need jazzing up, I grated some Permigiano-Reggiano a splash of cracked pepper and a little drizzle of Olive Oil it was then perfecto....  Although we thought the two pizzas wouldn't be enough for the 4 of us. We were suprisingly very satisfied.  Will try again."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place for months but there was always a line up. so one Sunday afternoon I called ahead and made a reservation for 5:00 pm  (early I know but we were hungry)... We got there at 5:00 only to be told that we had to be out in 1 hour because the table was reserved at 6:00.  We thought, ok, we're starving and we didn't necessarily need to make a long visit out of it.   Decor was nice upstairs.. airy and fun.  I'd heard their pizza's were great so that's what I came for. Though I wasn't able to order a side with it unless I ordered the complete fixe prixe menu which included a fruit salad (?) .Who wants peach salad with their savoury pizza? Surely someone does but it would be nice to have a choice. I would have loved to have had an arugula or caprese salad with my red wine and pizza but I wasn't able to order a la carte. Weird.  So, my girlfriend and I both ordered a pizza and a bottle of wine. That's all. Not a very balanced meal and still $150. Pizza crust was good... I managed to get a tiny square of proscuitto on each quarter of the pizza.and a couple of other bits.   Sorry, but Terroni or L'il Baci does this way better without the attitude and for way less.  I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"5 stars for the pizza and the excellent service. The interior is not very large but was very cozy on a cold winter night. Our server greeted us and was kindly explaining the menu to us since it was our first time here. The server was very cute !  We had our pizza within 25-30 minutes. But it was worth the wait ! I think I would come back on a less busier night next time.  The food and ambiance of the restaurant was really great. Really glad I tried this place."}
{"text":"My bf and I tried to go to this restaurant on many occasions and were never fortunate to actually sit. The first time was on a Friday night and needless to say, it was busy. Average waiting time is an hour and even then, there are no guarantees. I really wanted to try the pizza so we decided on take out which actually could have been considered a sit-down (or rather stand-up) event. We were told to go to the bar and wait on the side to order our pizzas. The lady then asked if we would like to have drinks while we waited (great service by the way!) I indulged into my alcoholic craving and ordered a Negroni which was nice and strong. Our pizza's came and of we went, but I am sure they would not have minded if we stood and ate? We had, what else, the margherita pizza and I won't go into the debate between Libretto and this place, but it was good. Nothing to complain about except the price which some might find a bit much considering the size and ingredients.   Another time my bf and I tried to come here, it was yet again on a busy and packed Saturday evening. My bf called for reservations and was told we didn't need any because there were many tables available. I am not sure if this was a kind way of saying we don't take reservations because of course being only 5 minutes away, allowed a big group to take up all the seats. We were told we JUST missed our chance. FYI - Make reservations and HOLD on to it.  All in all, I have yet to really have a great, overall experience at this high-end pizza joint, but I am looking forward to it. The concept of simple foods (pizza, wine, and antipasto) is very appealing to me. The restaurant has two floors but I guess I should count my lucky stars that I made it to the bar at least. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh yum! That's what you will say when you bite into your pizza here.   We were actually in the vicinity to try out a bar called Montauk but were too early and hungry. Walked in to the restaurant and were told that it would be an hour or so since it was a walk-in but luckily there was a cancellation and we got a table :)  We ordered two pizzas, the Dominator and Calabrese. The Dominator won hands down, the Calabrese was good too but not as good as the Dominator. The drinks however... not so good.  Will definitely go back for the pizza sometime but maybe go somewhere else for drinks."}
{"text":"Was there this week for dinner. Had Cinque Stagione, it was OK. There was no flavour of Truffle oil or the black pepper as mentioned as ingredients on the menu. The pizza was baked well. The cappuccino was not good at all. I probably won't return. I like Libretto much better."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 medium pizzas, both was the worst pizza that I ever tried before. I don't want to try this anymore. I ordered it by Uber Eats and I payed $40(!!) for 2 mediums and horrible pizzas that are in my garbage right now. What it's not fair because pizza is my favourite dish. *Detailed review below:* - GOOD MARIANNA: Dough: the part that wasn't completely burned was ok.  Topping: Salty!  - ROCCO PIZZA:   Dough: Completely undercooked in the middle. Topping: Just horrible. Salty, a lot of SALT. This one was by far the worst pizza I ever tried."}
{"text":"We did the Pre-Fix, which was so worth it for the price.  We got the Diavola and The Dominator for pizza, which were really good!  Got the Calamari and Mussels as an Appetizer  All in all it was good pizza, good atmosphere and great service!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza with decent prices. Though I was surprised by the number of people that were there when I went..its location is relatively hidden since its close to Greenwood. I suppose it must be quite popular for those who live around it. Very limited desert choices. Seating can be kind of tight, my table was very close to the one next to mine and waiters would still stand and walk through the little spacing between our tables."}
{"text":"The pizza is outstanding, the ambience fun and the service friendly. It's one of the few restaurants in the city that I keep going back to over and over."}
{"text":"We visited this place for a birthday celebration. The reservation was made well in advance and when we showed up the table was set for up for nicely already. The dinning area has a nice roomy feel. They also have a Prix Fix menu which looks interesting as it was very good value (27$ for 3 or was it 4 courses?). Ah well we had been munching on stuff before hand so just stuck to the pizza. We were a larger group there was an assortment of pizzas across the board.  I got to try the following  Margherita Extra, A decent version of there namesake pizza. Well balanced Vegetarian. Good medley of vegetables. Roasted well.  Alla Campagnolo. Decent but I was kind of lost on the ingredients as the cheese overpowered everything else. The dough is nice and sauce is nicely balanced. With the pizza scene heating up in TO I would say their pizza belongs in the upper echelons of pizzerias. The wine list if decent and the prices are reasonable.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This will be harsh.  I am not sure what all the fuss is about. Very ordinary ingredients presented in a nice atmosphere, poor service, and slightly over priced is not enough to wow me.  What a disappointment. Looks nice, reviews are good so what went wrong.  I blame the good reviews for this place on the MacDonalds generation. Frightening really when you think about it. All those that were raised on MacDonalds now rating restaurants.  I'm really not sure why they are opening so many locations. I cant see this being any more than a flash in the pan. I wish FBI Pizza from Etobicoke would hurry and open one in the east end."}
{"text":"You see, I have this one friend who has a car, and he's REALLY nice to sometimes drive me to dinner at places that are hard to get to by TTC.  This was one of those occasions. We were seated at about 7pm without too much of a wait (after being told it was 1.5 hours at Libretto on the Danforth! No Way Jose!)  I was STARVING, so I asked for a plate of bread, which they kindly brought. I don't know if they usually do that, but they did it for me, and I appreciate it. Had I known how fast the pizza would have been delivered though, I need not have requested the extra bread. Our 3 pizzas were brought out quite promptly, steaming hot. They were good, but not great. I'm not sure if the toppings weren't flavorful enough, or if there just wasn't enough toppings, but it didn't blow me away. You know, the service was good, and the food wasn't bad, but I don't think it would be worth the trip out there to go again. (Unless I've got a drive, of course.)  1 pizza and 1 glass of bubbly for $35 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"The pizzas are quite delicious here, and their arugula cranberry pear salad was really tasty! The crust was just the way I like it-  Baked in the stone oven fluffy and toasted.   It was a fairly quiet night when we stopped by for dinner, but I would go back again for a solid pizza and salad. The service was fast and no frills."}
{"text":"Came by cause we were craving pizza for dinner and it was a pretty decent place! It was a quiet night there so the service was friendly and quick - no frills.  The pizza was delicious and I enjoyed the crust- baked in the oven- fluffy and toasted. The cranberry arugula pear salad was also very delicious and complemented the white sauce/ cheese pizza we ordered very well!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this place. I thought maybe it'll be better than the burnt pizza I had at Pizza Libretto but sadly, I left feeling like my dreams of having an awesome pizza joint nearby were crushed. The service was good and attentive and the decor was pleasing to the eye but the pizza was incredibly bland. I ordered the Funghi Pizza which boasted having a mix of mushrooms. The only mushrooms I saw were tiny button ones (ok, maybe they were crimini). I was expecting portabello or porcini or anything with more pizazz. I requested some chili oil to spice things up but all I succeeded in doing was making my thin pizza mushy.  Blandness still remained. Back to dialling 967-11-11."}
{"text":"Would you like a side of \"influenza\" with your pizza?  Made reservations easily online via Opentable for 8:30 pm on Friday night.  The parking in the area is limited, so we parked on a side street.  Walked through the front door of the restaurant at 8:32 pm.    Strike one: no organization at the front door.  Just a mass of customers standing around, no clarity as to what you should do when you arrive.  The hostess' computer is right in the middle of the mass of customers, with my name, phone number, email address promptly displayed on the screen --- not a whole lot of customer privacy going on here, so should you choose to book a reservation, I'd suggest using a fake name if you don't want everyone in line knowing everything about you.  So weird, I've never seen anything like it.  It seems that the hostess is also a busser and support staff, so she's rarely manning the door.  (As a side note, we were two minutes late and our name was already highlighted yellow -- for anyone who has used Opentable, that's an indicator we're 'late')  Strike two:  When the hostess finally came back to the front, it was already 8:38.  She said it would be a while for our table -- but I thought we had a reservation?  No apology given, no real explanation.  \"They're still at the table, it'll be a while.\"  Uhm -- ok, I guess?  She said if she cleared off a table downstairs it would be a little less time, but still a wait.  I wanted to highlight HER in yellow.  Strike three: when the waitress came by our table once we were sat, she had an obvious cold.  As in, half-way through the specials, she turned from us and started hacking a lung.  \"Sorry,\" she said with a smile, and turned back to us.  Hmm. OK, well, she's not the chef, so we'll be alright, I thought (incorrectly).  Since I love aperol spritzes, and it's actually a cocktail on their (very small) cocktail list, I ordered one.  Guess who made my aperol spritz!  With her hands, on the orange peel, that she then plopped in my drink!  Sick lady.  Coughing and hacking while making my drink.  I know, because I was facing the bar watching her doing it, my eyes the size of saucers.  The worst part?  The drink wasn't good.  Worst aperol spritz I've ever had, and it is my favourite drink so I order it everywhere that has aperol.  :(  Strike four: bathrooms weren't clean at all.  Totally disgusting.  Now -- the pizzas are good!  Really good.  I didn't like the appetizer or the dessert, but the pizza, which is why you're there, is good.  Not good enough to return, since I don't live close, so I can't do take-out, which would be the only way I'd eat this pizza again."}
{"text":"This is the latest outpost for this chain of pizza restaurant. Arguably not the greatest location as I personally find this neighborhood to be less desirable late at night. However there seems to be some moment in terms of new restaurants here so one never know this might end up like Ossington.  Anyway one to main the spot this place has lot of seating and doesn't seem to have much traction so might be a suitable spot if one seeks space for a larger crowd on the weekend.  We both opted for the Prix Fix. Salad was caprese and for pizza I went for the mushroom. They allow substitution which might be good for some folks. My DC even got them to put tomato sauce on a white pizza!  Salad was good though I think it needed a little more salt as the olive oil made it to mellow. Pizza was decent like the other location. As for dessert they really faltered here. The chocolate tart was horrible. It had a very grainy texture. I did sample the nutella mousse and that was awful as well. My recommendation is if you can dessert somewhere else by all means don't go for the priz fix.  3.5 stars all said and done."}
{"text":"I came here on Friday night with 3 friends and we walked in the door around 8:30pm. I was surprised to see it relatively empty but that might have been because it was later than most people start dinner.   The server was so friendly and offered to help us chose our pizzas based on his favourites.   We were dining in couples so two people chose the $30 prix fixe menu which comprised of an appetizer, a pizza and a dessert while the others just ordered their pizzas. We ended up sharing all of the appetizers and desserts because...well...it's just more strategic that way!   At our table, we ordered:  The Caprese (Appetizer) The Arancini (Appetizer) Diavola  Margherita  The Dominator  Calabrese   The caprese salad was simple and rustic; red and yellow tomatoes drizzled with a high quality olive oil and basil. Made for a beautiful picture!  The pizzas were wonderful and made in Neopolitan style (thin crust that is crispy on the outside and chewy inside with lovely burnt bits). The pizzas with meat were nicely covered and a bit crispy from the wood oven. The red sauce was bursting with flavour; rustic and fresh enough to make you feel like you were having a pizza that stood out from other places in Toronto.   ONE WORD OF CAUTION: When something says spicy on the menu, they mean it!! We all have a fairly good tolerance for heat but the hot cacciatore sausage on the Calabrese pizza was actually HOT! The Diavola, although still hot, was a lot more manageable to eat. We asked for hot chili oil to drizzle on our pizzas but didn't use a lick of it due to the heat from the meats.   The ambiance of the restaurant was nice and casual...we didn't feel rushed at all. In fact, we stayed at the table after paying our bill for a good half hour talking. It was only after we realized that the restaurant was closed (around 10:30pm) and that they were sweeping and cleaning up that we felt badly for not leaving earlier! They never forced us out or asked us to leave...they were more than happy to allow us to sit and talk.   Overall a GREAT experience and we'd be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is the newest outpost of Queen Margherita Pizza. When I found out that this bad boy had opened and that no one had reviewed it on Yelp! yet (opening up my window to be the first to a venue) I knew I had to go immediately. I kid, I kid. I went because Queen Margherita Pizza has it all figured out; doing great Italian food without all those pastas that literally no one enjoys.  As we walked into meet our group a tab bit late (Mike's 1st rule of group dinners: Never show up first, be rude.) we were greeted by thunderous music and two friendly hostesses that I can only describe as \"Spicy Meat-a-balls\".I was a bit worried a bit at this point in that I find loud music can leave a last memory on a good meal. Luckily as we walked down to our table, which was on the lower level, the music became far more muted. So crisis averted on that one guys!  We sat down and immediately got to work...ignoring the menu and discussing the days hot gossip. Once we were done talking shit about friends and loved ones we began to look at the menu. The menu, though on the smaller side, is deceptive. There's a lot of different ways to play it. In the end I split 2 appetizers and a wheel with my lady while the other 4 split 3 pies and 3 apps while going the Prix Fixe which also comes with desserts (as you all know, I've never really had a sweet tooth).  After just the right amount of time 4 of the 5 apps came. Two Fritto Misto, a Romaine Salad with Speck, and the special for the night Beet Pure with Feta. I can only vouch for what I had but the Fritto Misto was great, light battered with just the right hit of lemon and a simple, garlicky, marinara sauce. The beat salad was also great though I found the feta to be the real highlight. Now, here was the one glaring issue of the evening. As I said we had ordered 5 appetizers but only 1 had come (GUH!), after asking our waitress not once, not twice, but thrice the boccaccini finally came. It's arrival wasn't really helped by the fact that this dish was 10+ dollars and consisted of 8 tiny boccaccini balls, and this is for boccaccini standards.  Onto the good stuff, i have no idea what everyone else had but we got THE DOMINATOR!!! (Can't remember if it was spelt in all caps with so many exclamations but it had to have been, right?). Well baby let me tell you this pizza was dominated...by me! The fennel sausage was fatty, and moist and crispy from the wood fire oven. The rapini was all rapini-i-eeeeee and the smoked mozzarella was nothing to shake a stick at. And the crust! My god the crust! For a thin crust pizza this thing has a crust that was so robust!  Dessert I don't really remember which I guess is all you really need to know about that.  The only other real issue that we had was how quickly the bill added up. Though I didn't see the physical bill itself I feel like this was attributed to alcohol costs specifically the bottles of wine that were suggest by our waitress. So just a word to the wise, be sure to ask pricing on that."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant once with my boyfriend, never again.  The place was empty, yet the customer service was atrocious. Our waitress was a snotty teenager who spent most of her time rolling her eyes to the ceiling than serving tables. It took 15 minutes for her to take our drink order, even though we were sitting right in front of her as she chatted with another teenage server at the bar. We ordered a could-be-Digiorno-pizza and over-priced wine. She didn't offer us pepper, so after waiting another 15 minutes to catch her attention my boyfriend walked to the bar to grab one of the available pepper grinders. Suddenly aware of her job, the waitress quickly snatched the grinder and snapped that it wasn't for the tables. She was a useless tit."}
{"text":"Pizza is absolutely delicious (almost the best margherita pizza I've ever had), but, in my opinion, exceedingly expensive for what you receive. For those newer to the pizza scene - the margherita pizza is essentially a cheese pizza with basil (i.e. not to be confused with the alcoholic drink of the same name 'marguerita'). This particular pizza ($14) had fior de latte cheese and basil - as a brie / havarti / other creamy cheese enthusiast I can't generally call myself a fior de latte fan but this really worked! I say almost the best I've had simply because the crust was burnt which detracted from the taste somewhat, but on the whole it was very tasty. I did find it a bit surprising that a meatless pizza would sell for over $12 and still be relatively small in size (not difficult to finish in one sitting unlike some other pizzas in the city e.g. Marché). I would recommend going in-person as opposed to ordering online as the delivery fee on top of the already premium price doesn't amount to the best deal, but this pizza is worth a try otherwise! I would definitely be interested in coming back and trying something a bit more adventurous on the menu!"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday night and it was relatively empty given how large their lower area is. The upper area is a nice, minimally lit area that's comfortable when it's still light out. The lower area is a bit dungeon-esque. I wonder what it would be like to eat down there.  A friend and I shared their prix fixe menu, which at $29, includes an appetizer, pizza, and dessert. I thought it would've been too little food as I normally eat a lot - too much - but it was a good portion. I wasn't stuffed, but I was satisfied. My friend doesn't eat a lot, so I don't know that it would be enough for two people under normal circumstances.   APPETIZER - Arugula Salad ----------------------------------------------- It is a mountain. It comes with cranberries, walnuts, and goat cheese. It was so simple, but one of the best salads I've had and the portion was huge.   MAIN - \"The Dominator\" pizza ----------------------------------------------- Unfortunately, the pizza came slightly burnt, the crust a bit black, and it's a pet peeve of mine when restaurants serve food that is visibly burnt because it shows they'd rather hope the customer doesn't say anything than proactively try to serve the best food possible.  The Dominator comes with fennel sausage, rapini, smoked mozzarella, and fried chili oil. It wasn't anything special, but it did taste good.  DESSERT - Nutella Mousse ----------------------------------------------- There are a few desserts, none of which are listed on their menu, probably because they rotate depending on availability. There was ice cream, some type of cake, and maybe three more options. We ordered the nutella mousse, which was just a small cup of mouse with a cookie or graham crumb on top. It was alright, a little more chocolate than nutella flavour.  Altogether, the food was enjoyable, the portions were good, and the restaurant and atmosphere were comfortable."}
{"text":"Apparently the 34th year of my life means pizza for me.  Through the power of Yelp, I chose QMP to celebrate my birthday dinner with my family, BF, BFF and her BF.  Wow....so glad I chose this place!  You know when you are at a big table and everyone is chatting, laughing, and the food arrives and it is complete silence?!  That was us.  All 8 of us were diving into these pies like greedy little pigs.    The crust is almost like a naan.  Very light, airy, yet with that all important bit of crispness on the bottom.  My only comment on the crust would be a bit more salt could be added to the dough.  The toppings were so fresh.  I sampled a couple of different pizzas and was so impressed with each.  The veggie one is like a garden on a pizza, the Italian sausage one is meaty delish, and the prosciutto one was some of the best cured pork I have had.  The space is adorable, and with the wood burning oven it still manages to stay cool.     I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Using authentic / certified products from Italy is wonderful but without craftsmanship those products are wasted. Margherita pizza was very soggy. Tomatoes were too watery and dough was chewy. Not a well made pizza at all. Very disappointing and certainly not close to a true Napoletana pizza.  Might be a hip place but pizza is overrated."}
{"text":"The staff here is nice and the second floor is very cool since it's windows pretty much all around and has a neat feel to it. There's a lot of talking going on so it's a good place to go with friends, they're happy to pull tables together too and the staff is friendly.  The pizza here is pretty good but it's not my favorite pizza spot within 50km but it's still a good wood oven pizza and the appetizers were quite tasty with good presentation which always counts with me.  I like that they had italian beers available and if you're looking for somewhere new to try out and have a long meal with friends where you order a bunch of things and share then this is worth checking out for a change of scenery."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for a date because the atmosphere is nice and the staff is very pleasant.  The pizza is good, but nothing great.  It doesn't make you crave for more and more(which a great pizza should do)  Its cooked perfectly but the taste is not addictive- which I can say for most places in east york that do wood burning style.  Regardless, if you want something different give it a shot(much better than libretto pizza)and its a great date spot."}
{"text":"My favourite pizza in Toronto! The upper level is nice and bright, the starters and pizzas are mouthwatering. The desserts don't blow me away and the music is so so depending on when you go, I don't really need to hear toxic by Britney Spears twice in one sitting. Staff are friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Great pizza especially the one with pork belly topping!! YUMMMMM! Service was good too. Good wine list. Just a little chilly temperature wise."}
{"text":"After visiting with family in Leslieville we decided to go for pizza at QM.   Since this a popular restaurant for pizza, I would suggest reservations because it fills up fast at dinner time.   We sat downstairs which was comfortable but upstairs is quite bright and and nice. Also upstairs is roomier and you don't get the constant cool air from the door opening. The place is so busy that people aren't fussed about where they eat. They even had patrons seated at the bar.   We had the Giovanna (white pizza with cheese, green olives basil and garlic) and the Diavolo ( soprosaro, black olives and hot peppers). My husband and I split those two pizzas and we both agreed that the Diavolo was our favorite. Our kids ate the margarita and devoured it!!!!  The crust is traditional authentic and made with 00 in  a wood oven. This rates among the best crusts we've had. Perfect combination of crispy thin crust and slight doughiness in the actual exterior crust. Yum!!!! Our server also provided a side of hot peppers which was a nice touch for those that like a little heat with their food!   Our server was pleasant and very friendly.   If I could I would give it 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"The best pizza around. The crust is especially delicious.  The one with kale is a great balance of flavours."}
{"text":"Love it here!  Went with a friend and we split two pizzas, the four cheese and a mushroom pizza.  So delicious! The dough is perfectly crispy and fluffy all at the same time!  Pizzas are reasonably priced, around $15.  They also have a $30 ( i think) prix fixe menu that I would totally love to try because the appetizers and desserts sounded amazing.  Just wasn't hungry enough this night!  What really seals the deal on this place, though, is the ambiance.  We sat upstairs and the huge glass windows really make the place.  It has such a great covered-warehouse feel, without feel cheesy or forced.  I would go to this place if only just to sit in this room!  The only drawback of this place is that it's all the way out in Leslieville! I would go here all the time if it was more convenient!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try Queen Margherita Pizza last night. I've passed by this location many times before not knowing they have a large lower dining area. There is also an open kitchen with a large wood oven burning in the middle where the pizzas are cooked. The pizzas are true neopolitan style, and come with a variety of toppings. We had the calabrese pizza and the white pulled pork one. Both were delicious with generous toppings and the most delicious, sweet dough. I ate all of my crust (which is rare for me). We will definitely be back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Location: On Dundas West. Street parking is available but check the zoning, as there are meters. We had no problem parking on a Sunday evening around 5pm.   The place: When you walk in, you get the impression that the place is very small because there are just a few tables. However, their main dining area is downstairs and fairly spacious. Decor is minimal and urban, lots of wood, and offers a cozy vibe. The best part is that the kitchen is open and you can see the huge wood burning oven and all the pizzas that come in and out of there. Yum!  The goods: I went with the prix fixe menu that included an appetizer, main and dessert. For starters, I had the fritti misto - strands of zucchini (fried) and fat, battered shrimp. I think the aïoli that was served with it was lemon. I have to tell you that it was a damn good appetizer. The only downside is that it was a little greasy. My main was the Gio (pizza) - I swapped the prosciutto for mild Cacciatore. The dough was SO good. I mean, I could smell it and knew I would love it before I even took a bite. It's flat so not super filling unless you eat the whole thing (I couldn't). My toppings included fior di latte, the sausage and cherry tomatoes + the sauce. The sauce was delicious and not at all bitter or acidic. It was the perfect combo of salty and (slightly) sweet. I really enjoyed the pizza, as did the group of people I was dining with. All of that said, I do feel like there could have been a little more sausage and a few more cherry tomatoes. I didn't have the dessert because we had birthday cake. Side note - I ordered an Old Fashioned that completely sucked. I didn't say anything but at $14 a glass, I should have made them take that off the bill.   Service: I think our waiter was alone to serve the entire restaurant because I honestly don't remember seeing anyone else. So, in light of this, I have to say that the service was good. Sure there were some delays but nothing really worth complaining about. The restaurant was packed so what could he do?   Price point: I can't say I was thrilled to get a bill for close to $60 for pizza. The crappy drink was definitely overpriced at $14, and I didn't expect the restaurant to automatically add the gratuity. I understand that it was a large party so it's not the automatic addition of the tip that annoyed but rather, the NINE extra dollars they added to my bill. I mean come on man! It's not that I think the waiter didn't do a good job - but the fact is that for a party of our size, there should have been at LEAST two waiters serving our tables and if that wasn't possible then get the manager in there to lend a hand.   This is a solid place for pizza and worth checking out - just avoid the cocktails."}
{"text":"This is the most depressing $14 grilled calamari I've ever see.  I think someone ate half of it before they gave it to me"}
{"text":"The food here is just mediocre.  I chose the prix fix menu that comes with an appetizer, a pizza (any pizza), and a dessert. I ordered the grilled calamari, Dominator pizza, and dessert. The calamari is mediocre, a little on the chewy side. The pizza was thin crust, which I get, but the crust was made so soft it basically turned into mush. The toppings kept falling off and the taste was just ok. I could probably make better at home."}
{"text":"Really tasty and just a block away from where I work!   I've been meaning to come for a while, but can't go alone, a medium sized pizza is too large to finish on my own and $14~ price point seems a lot for one person.   Finally came here with a friend, and also found out they have a set menu ($18 with dessert and any pizza on the menu!)  We had the Pizza with Italian spicy sausage etc. I loved the thin crust crunchiness of the dough, but found the crust a little salty. But it was crunchy on the bottom, which I have discovered is a very important feature in a good pizza.  Service was excellent and at lunch time, found I didn't really need to make reservations.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"So about 6 weeks prior to my fiance's birthday party, I made a reservation. A few days prior to the event. I called to add a few people only to learn my reservation had been confused with another reservation with the same name and number of people, where mine had been overridden. Ellie on the phone made sure she could accommodate 24 people (effectively at the last minute as a result of another person's goof up). On the night of, we had 3 extra people showed up - Ellie (our waitress now) made sure they had chairs and space. Somehow Ellie split bills to individuals, including a group of four who split a few wine bottles. Finally I had brought a custom gourmet cake with a firework sparkler candle which was welcomed for a modest cutting fee. I'd been warned from others the staff aren't so accommodating, if that is true, certainly weren't speaking of Ellie.  I have her to thank for making my fiance's birthday a success.  As far as the food - the spicy sausage pizza was among the best pizzas I've ever had the pleasure of exposing my taste buds to."}
{"text":"I had just order an delivery gluten free pizza from here. And it was such an disappointment!! I had threw it out after the first silce. What a waste of money and was not worth breaking my diet for."}
{"text":"My dad took our family out for pizza and I had the simple Margherita and it was amazing. I would 110% come back to eat the food. The place itself seems a bit hidden, not as nice but is definetly worth it. The server was polite and the entire service was great."}
{"text":"I dislike soggy pizzas. This place doesn't serve soggy pizzas! Great food, great service, and comfortable and relaxing environment.   Not too loud for conversations, but I was upset that soft drinks didn't have free refills. At least I can delay the onset on diabetes , when I dine here."}
{"text":"I love pizza. Most people do. There always seems to be a Terroni/Libretto/QMP debate for the best pie. Having eaten at the former two many times, I was excited to finally test this one out. QMP takes the cake.   Hands down, the best pizza I've had in this city.   We went mid-afternoon for a late lunch, and the place was pretty much empty. We shared the lunch prix fixe ($20 includes app, pizza of your choice and dessert) and it was plenty. The gelato was decent, and the selection of meats/cheese app was pretty basic.  Again, the pizza was absolutely amazing. We had the Giovanni.    The only reason for four stars is the service. It was terrible. I know it's an awkward time of day for servers, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. Perhaps it was just a fluke moment, or the server was in a bad mood, but seriously, you're there to SERVE. Is it that hard to be pleasant?"}
{"text":"Gluten free pizza is NOT GOOD. The crust is incredibly salty which make me question if they have tasted their own product. I love salty but this is way to much. I have tried practically every GF pizza crust in the city and this is one of the worst.   On another note, our leftover pieces were topped one another so the toppings of one stuck the crust of the other. So ridiculous.   Flourless chocolate cake was delicious."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to sink my teeth into the locally acclaimed QM!  Let me just say that within the spectrum of pizza dining, this place lands on the ultra-lux portion.  Fantastic floor plan, flexible for parties single to large, option to sit by tall windows on street level, or downstairs by the pizza oven, or by the bar.  The wait staff was attentive and charming.  However, their execution at up selling was not smooth by any means.  Be prepared to cringe a little when they ask, \"would you like to stay a little longer?  Maybe have a coffee, or wine?  Or anything else?\"   This could just be me, but I can't stomach when waiters use similar jargon to an ex you happened to run into.  The pizza itself was a lovely 12\" thin crust beaut, where each bite broke to a satisfying crush and light bursts of a tangy sauce.  Unfortunately, to my fellow cheese lovers, you may find yourself disappointed in the cheesiness department.  Very happy I had a chance to drop by today.  However, to me, it's more of a \"once in a while\" sort of vibe vs. a place you would frequent on the regular."}
{"text":"Queen Margherita is awesome!!! My 8 year old loves it and loves all the food on the menu - as do his parents! our favorites are the Arugula salad - love the sweetness in this! The calmari - yum. And all of the pizza's are delicious! Our server is always awesome and friendly! We will continue to have family dinners here for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times and always get the Diavola pizza.  It never disappoints; hot and delicious!  The La Scala however is hit and miss...lately more misses than hits.    Either there's not enough pork, or more recently it seems like they've changed their recipe (or pork supplier)?  Not sure if I'll give Queen Margherita one more chance, but if I do it won't be La Scala!"}
{"text":"Pizzas like in Italy! Simple ingredients, thin dough. The Nutella mousse was delicious. Nice atmosphere too. I will go back."}
{"text":"I went to Queen Margherita on a Saturday at around 7:30pm with 2 friends. It was super busy, but they offered to accommodate us at a table for 2, or else we would have to wait until approximately 9pm. We agreed that the table for 2 would suit us just fine.  My friends ordered the calamari as a starter, and they said that it was very good - crispy but not too greasy. We each ordered a pizza, I had the Cinque Stagione (a white pizza with veggies), and my friends had the Gio Oldschool and Alla Campagnolo pizzas. I was a little disappointed that none of the rosso pizzas were vegetarian-friendly, but I did very much enjoy my pizza. The crust was thin, the pizza was cooked perfectly, and it had a great flavour - the combination of toppings went together very well.  Our server was super nice and very attentive. She took our orders quickly and came back to check on us during our meal to make sure everything was to our liking.  Ultimately, I would really like to see some vegetarian-friendly red pizza options, but I very much enjoyed my experience and would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"My go-to pizza place on the east side. Pizzas always have the freshest toppings, made to order.   Their arancini balls are delicious, ask for extra sauce. Sauce is fantastic."}
{"text":"Awesome Pizza....horrible service! Dined in and it took 25 minutes to get pizza that they claim takes two minutes to cook. Gave them a second chance, by calling in my order for pickup - that took 45 minutes! Decided to give them one last chance...went on a Sunday around 2pm, ordered and 45 minutes had still not received our order! We ened up leaving after 45 minutes with no lunch and completely frustrated. This place is off our \"list\". There is no denying they have the best pizza in Toronto, just a little difficulty managing a resturant. PS - Try not booking a 20 person party on a weekend day. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Superb pizza.. thin chewy crust, fiora di latte mozzarella cheese is sublime. Diavola pizza was perfect. Nice space as well. Great service."}
{"text":"I was recently there with a large group and the meal surpassed my expectations.  Delicious crust - and fantastic service. Our waiter had anticipated every request and we were never left waiting.   Unlike my favorite west end Napoli pizza (Libretto) they take reservations."}
{"text":"Finally dined at QMP tonight !   Without sounding like a broken record, making resos is *k e y* ! It was packed tonight and reservation-less folks were told that it would be a long wait. Making a reservation here is easy - you can do it on-line and you'll get a confirmation within an hour (that's what they say, anyway).   The decor of QMP is pretty cool ... there is a lower level (where the entrance is) that has a bar/waiting area and then there is the upper level, which is the dining room area of the resto. The latter looks like it used to be some sort of factory (v cool).   Menu consists of mostly (like 99.9%) pizza. You have the option of ordering Prixe Fixe items a la carte as well. I would highly recommend the M A T T E O ... it's so, so, so good. You get three types of mushrooms with shredded ricotta cheese on top. The crust is fluffy and the rest of the pie is thin. It just melts in your mouth.   I will definitely be back.   We have a S O L I D four star here ~"}
{"text":"I thought this place had better pizza than the pizza libertto.. Maybe it's just me but I thought the crust was better and the ambiance was lot cozier..!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got the Calabrese pizza and omg it was so delicious and great for people who love a bit of spice (as the sausages on the pizza were spicy). It's a perfect sized personal size pizza cut into four slices. To drink I got La Padrona which was amazing and also a mojito which was just as amazing.  The atmosphere is very cozy with dimmed lights but still a traditional vibe.   I'd definitely come here again as I enjoyed the food and the atmosphere very much:)"}
{"text":"I liked that the menu offered lots of interesting options. The service was fine. We were seated promptly with our reservation. We had plenty of room -- not crammed in like some places in Toronto. The desserts were okay.  In the end, the pizza was just mediocre. The ingredients seemed fresh, but the centres were disappointingly soggy. We were a group of four, and we all tried each other's pizzas (all different). Am I going to say it? Yeah, I prefer Pizzeria Libretto, hands down.   A couple of other complaints:   - My drink was tasty, but the glass was sticky. Couldn't get it clean, and kept wiping my fingers on my napkin.   - We were seated upstairs, which seemed nicer and airier than the downstairs (more of a pub atmosphere, oddly?), but next to the window. Normally, I'd like that, but the building is obviously older and the window wasn't sealed properly. Being one of the colder winters Toronto's experienced, our backs were kind of chilled."}
{"text":"Been here twice over the past six months.  I love the space.  The second floor, aka the main dining room, has an open kitchen, high ceilings, rustic/industrial interior.  It's a really nice place to have dinner.  Great vibe.  Sadly, I can't rave about the pizza in the same way.  I like the crust and most toppings, but I find the pizza slightly underdone.  The centre of the pie is always soggy, making it hard to eat.  I wish they could bake it a tad longer so it would crisp up a bit more.  It's not true Neopolitan pizza as I've had the chance to enjoy recently in Naples.  That being said, I really enjoyed the diavolo, even though it was soggy.  On the flip side, they have a pizza with only sausage and rapini: no cheese, no sauce.  It's weird.  I do not recommend it.    I will say the prix fixe is a pretty good deal.  For $25, you get a basic appetizer, a pizza and a dessert.  You can pick from 3-4 appies and desserts and any of the pizza.  Good for a easy date! :)"}
{"text":"Have been to QMP a few times for lunch and another time for a work party. The pizzas here are made in Neopolitan style and I love how the crust ends up thin, crispy and chewy at the same time.   My go to pizza is the Alla Campagnolo, which is their white pizza with mushrooms, Asiago, garlic and goat cheese. I am salivating just thinking about the meaty mushrooms and tangy cheese. Yum!!!! Their namesake pizza with fior de latte cheese is also delicious.  In addition to pizza, they have pretty darned good chicken wings but boy were they spicy! Their arugula salad with shaved grano padano cheese and balsamic drizzle is tasty as well. QMP also offers a prix fixe option of your choice of pizza, appetizer, and dessert for $29. However their pizzas are quite big and I usually end up eating half for lunch and taking away the other half for enjoyment later.   They have a pretty big seating area that covers both the main floor as well as a more spacious  lower level.  (40/100)"}
{"text":"Reservations are a must! I came here by myself and still had to wait 15 minutes for a bar seat!  So is the pizza better than Libretto? I don't think so. The quality is similar but where QMP thrives is the $25 table d'hote. Basically, for $25 you get to pick any appetizer, any pizza and any dessert. Perfect little meal for a couple who's not starving.  Would I go again? Sure, I'll just make sure I make a reservation in advance. Although I don't feel it's worth the trip for the pizza alone, the place has a great atmosphere and for $25 it's hard to beat."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Always get the margherita. They never pick up the phone or return voicemail when I try to order ahead"}
{"text":"Our go to spot for great food, very good wine and the prix fixe menu is a real deal.  $29 bux for an app, giant pizza for two and a desert.  You can get out of there with that, a bottle of wine and an extra app for $80!  Hard to beat."}
{"text":"Great Pizza - definitely one of the best Napolitano's in the city-  a must try. If you like spicy ask for the homemade pepperoncini to put on you pizza."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza served in a beautiful refurbished space!"}
{"text":"I visited the Dundas location with a group of 8 on a Friday night.   The food is good - especially the kale salad (best I've ever had). The pizza has a very thin crust which is chewy and crispy at he same time... Delicious.   My major problem was with the service, which was just awful from the beginning.  Our server would order drinks for 3 people, then disappear for 10 or 15 minutes before taking the other 5.  The food came out all at once: appetizers, mains ... Everything. The table was so crowded we had to stack stuff, and the pizza was cold by the time we got to it. They just shrugged when we asked what the deal was.  Oh and they forgot 2 pizzas entirely, and they came just as the rest of the table was finishing their table."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here.  It's cozy and chic, without being overcrowded or too loud.  The service is pretty good and the menu isn't very large, which I like.  If you don't get a 3 course fix prix, then you don't usually have the option of ordering a side or dessert, which I find perplexing.  The food is good and fix prix is only $25-$27, so I would just go ahead and order it.  The pizza is good and you can see the giant oven they shipped in from Italy, which is a nice touch.  Pizza Libretto offers fancier/gourmet pizza.  You'd come here for the nice classics. I've been 3 times and would go again.  Parking can be found on Queen Street East - not free, but not expensive."}
{"text":"I love Queen Margherita! A great place to relax, enjoy delicious food and hang out with friends & family. Service is always spot on. My favourites are the romaine salad, calamari, Giovanna pizza, and tiramisu for dessert - all so delicious! The upstairs dining room has a really rustic feel to it, with lots of natural light and a great view of Queen St. They are very accommodating of large groups and young kids, and they take reservations which is great. Cocktail selection is a bit limited but the pizza is the real winner here. Highly recommend QMP."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. I had the Dominator pizza and it was superb.  Fantastic depth of flavour, top quality ingredients, excellent flavour profile and great texture.  Pizza crust was spectacular.  Nearing total perfection!   Excellent fixed price option for $29.  Will definitely repeat!"}
{"text":"Our pizza was incredible - everything is very fresh, and when they say the meat is spicy, it's true. The crust is lovely, nice and thin and properly cooked but also soft. Not sure how that magic happens.  The service, however, was terrible. Now, we didn't have reservations (seriously make reservations, I think they mentioned doing a couple of seatings per night) - it's an oddly shaped series of spaces and has a lot of character and potential - and is very popular. We chance it on a Saturday night knowing we had other options in the area, and were seated in the window at a breakfast bar style section looking out at Queen St East, which was just fine. We made immediate decisions about drinks and food as we were quite hungry. The drinks took a little long to reach us, and we would have ordered a second round - plus definitely water to go with the salty pizza that someone other than our waitress served us quickly and then ran away - but no one approached us again until we were finishing up. We had wanted other beverages to go with the good sized portions, but that might have been a little too much to ask.   I'd go back, but definitely make a reservation, and maybe order a second drink as soon as the first is set down. The wine list is pricey, but they can certainly get away with that given the volume of business and popularly of the place!"}
{"text":"Anyone unlucky enough to be around me from mid-December of '09 until Mid April of 2010, had to endure my excitement at this place opening. Seriously, I was like that Kristen Wiig sketch about the surprise party on SNL.  http://video.aol.ca/video-detail/saturday-night-live-skit-surprise-party/36028836148016112/?icid=VIDURVMOV03   The windows stated \"Authentic Napoletano Pizzeria coming soon\"  Me: \"Oh my god, I LOVE wood burning pizza!\"  Martini Boys article published in February 2010 \"The chefs are certified by the VPN in Italy to properly cook Napoletano pizza\"  Me: \"Oh my gawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwd, I really like Napoletana pizza! I'm freakin' excited!\"  Kat F gave me the inside scoop on the renos in mid-March. She said it's beautiful what they've done with the space.  Me: \"Oh my.........\"   you get the gist.   This basically continued until last weekend when I had a chance to FINALLY shut up and eat the damn pies.  The verdict?  Superb!    We arrived on a rainy night around 9:30 and snagged the last empty table in the place. tt was packed! They've done a wonderful job with the design. White painted brick with an amazing view of the streetcar yard courtesy of the wall to ceiling windows.   Service was really on the ball and professional. No 'effing around, People have complained about the $25 prix fixe menu being pushed on them but it really is a superb deal.   For starters, I had the butternut squash with prosciutto and arugula. The flavours played off each other really well. The bitter arugula was a nice bold counterpart to the squash and prosciutto. I had the porchetta pizza, the \"S.O.\" had the Margherita.   With the Margherita, the first thing you notice is how amazing the tomato sauce is. There wasn't a hint of tinniness. It was really subtle and well done. The cheeses were oh so good, the only thing I could have used more of were the basil leaves but it's a (really) minor quibble.  I opted for the porchetta pizza, which had the aforementioned porchetta, hot peppers and cheese. Amazing! The great salty, sweet and spicy tastes were well balanced and I loved the subtle kick of the peppers, which normally overwhelm the pizza.  The crusts were chewy and light. These guys know their stuff. The char was dotted around the pizzas with laser like precision. Perfect.  I am giving this 5 stars because they hit the ground running when they opened their doors. It's only been four weeks and everything went off without a hitch. My new favourite place!"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian pizza experience. Gourmet pizza extraordinaire!! Super friendly and accommodating staff; they are efficient and attentive. They like their jobs and make you feel quite welcome. And their desserts are amazing!! Good vibe!"}
{"text":"I have dined here on multiple occasions and every meal is on point! Delicious pizza (the dough is simply the best part), service is always fast and the ambiance is perfect for a quick lunch or a formal dinner. Price is on the higher end but it is definitely worth it. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Love! Love! Love! Have been to Queen Margherita Pizza a few times now, most recently with my family consisting of 12 people from ages 4 - 58. Everyone was thrilled. This is the perfect place for a family with young children as it is loud and busy, always!! The upstairs layout is fantastic also, with big, beautiful windows and surprisingly spacious seating. The first time I had a watermelon/olive oil/pistachio salad . . . . absolutely amazing. This time I shared a proscuitto/fig/honey salad with a young cousin, we were both delighted at the fruity flavour/combo and she actually ate most of it (astonishing for someone who normally prefers nuggets & fries!). Both times I had the pizza with all the mushrooms (can never remember the name) but I would try anything on the menu, everyone was happy with their choices. Of course, the classic Margherita pizza is great as well. Easy menu and nothing about it or the wine list is intimidating in the least. Where this restaurant really stands out is friendly service, and outstanding casual but trendy atmosphere. When the 12 of us go out, we can often feel in the way/cumbersome to restaurants . . . not here at all they were welcoming and sat us overlooking the streetcar yard which delighted the boys under 10.  Highly recommended for fantastic pizza without the bumper-to-bumper business of pizza Libretto. Oh ya, desserts are tasty as well!! Management: Please consider taking reservations on line!!"}
{"text":"For some unknown reason, QMP is all the rage these days. The pizza is fine, but there are better options. They're a pizza place that doesn't do take-out! QMP is pathetically pretentious and full of themselves."}
{"text":"Pizza tasted like charcoal and overpriced. 2 medium pizzas for $42.   Sorry but I hate leaving bad reviews but this may help this business improve their quality + pricing."}
{"text":"I don't know if a gourmet pizzeria with a view of a trolley yard is any much an upgrade of views from the Bus Terminal Diner's view of a subway station (since the streetcars at Russel Carhouse across the street mostly just sit there). But Queen Margherita has been here for some time now (I think this Leslieville location is their original?), and only now have I gotten around to eating at the local highly acclaimed chain.  It's a split-level family friendly trendy restaurant with a bar with a TV nobody watches down-a-stairs, and most of the seatings, the washrooms and an open pizza kitchen with wood oven (which has become quite a common feature with Toronto's upscale pizza places) up the rickety stairs you can feel from downstairs.   There's a prix fixe 3-course option that allows you to choose any pie plus an appetizer and dessert for $29 (circa 2015--don't you love inflation?). Otherwise just chow down on the pizzas, which is about bigger than a foot diameter, enough to fill up a single person by itself. Small menu, but every pie my family picked out turned out to be delightfully fresh, juicy, firm and cheesy, down to the crust. The one called the 'Birdman' for example ($16), is a blast of all that, with a touch of nuttiness from the sunflower seeds. Prices are on par with most gourmet pizzerias in town I've seen; menu lacks bold spiciness though.  Generally great service and food, set to a soundtrack of 90s hits (oh I sure miss Savage Garden). The entrance is quite cramped and involve a few steps of its own.  {TTC: a 501-2-3 or 31 to Queen/Greenwood. Or just board any streetcar that is retiring to Greenwood.}"}
{"text":"I went into QMP expecting it to be good, but just not as good as Pizza Libretto.  I had eaten twice at Libretto, read reviews of both places extensively, and in my mind, there was no possible way that QMP was going to outdo Libretto.  Needless to say, I was quite shocked when I found myself begrudgingly admitting (and my foodie friend was in total agreement) that the pizza was actually BETTER!  We ordered the Giovani (incredibly light and refreshing) and the Romalo (to which we added sausage, on the recommendation of our server).  Both were incredibly good, although my slight preference was for the Giovani... however, once I added the hot sauce (even the hot sauce is better here) to the Romalo (wouldn't dare adding it to Giovani, just wouldn't be right), it soared to a more-or-less equal height.  The pre-fixe option seems like a great option if you're ravenous, but we were both quite sated with the pizzas and our wine.  At $45/person for pizza and a glass of wine, it's a little on the pricier end, but totally worth it considering how delicious everything is.  I will definitely be going back, and even getting takeout to share with my family."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for dinner and we were very dissapointed.  They served me a glass of wine that had gone bad.  Luckily they switched the wine no problem.  When he pizza came out completely burnt, I didn't want to send a second item back.  I was shocked and disgusted that they would actually serve a customer something so charred and burnt.  The burn bits looked like large black tumorous growths.  It was repulsive to look at.  The wait staff didn't come back to ask how things were anyway so I just tried to pick around the burnt bits.  They shouldn't have even served that pizza to a customer.  Will never go back there again."}
{"text":"I was here for an event my real estate Agent had.  It was a private party, however there was plenty of food to go around so I can comment on that.  Service wise I will not comment since we did not experience the typical service here, other than to say the bartenders were really friendly and nice.  This restaurant is 2 floors...a tiny first floor and a slight bigger 2nd floor.  The 2nd floor has the big pizza oven.  The cooking area is semi open so you can see a little the pizza being made.  The pizzas are thin crust (just the way that I like it!) and were just lovely!  They had a variety of appetizers for us to nom nom nom on.  Rice balls (not bad but I've had better balls..lol); cheese/crackers/smoked salmon; and some other little crudites.  All were delicious!  The event had a band playing on the 2nd floor.  There is enough space for this, so not sure if a band plays there regularly.  If not, they should!  It would be really nice to hear some live music while eating.  Parking is annoying, but that isn't limited to this restaurant.  Basically along Queen St E is slightly frustrating because sometimes you spend more time looking for parking than eating  I will definitely be back on a regular night and update my review if anything changes."}
{"text":"Having lived in the hood for over 2 years, and having read rave reviews of this place, I was dying to visit.  Today was the day, but we only had time for take out.  We grabbed the Matteo (Mushroom), and the Margherita Doppia to go.  These were delish, but I bet they would have been even better dining there.  I can tell the toppings would have been gooey and delish.    Highly recommended, even for take out!"}
{"text":"Considering so many people have raved about this restaurant, I had high expectations. Maybe because their other two restaurants had just opened and they were not as focused on their original shop but everything was very mediocre.  The upstairs space was me to me and I loved how it was open, has wooden long tables, and even the potential for communal seating. You could see the wood fire burning oven in the back and the restaurant was very rustic overall. people weren't kidding when they said this place was loud. The place was definitely not full but even the bit chatter going around made it difficult to talk to the people at our table.  The waiter was courteous although seemed a little impatient at time. Between four girls, we shared two prix fixe meals. Eggplant crostini and ribs to start, they came out quickly and were pretty tasty. The shoestring potato shreds were nice to munch on as we waited for our pizzas.  The waiter had specifically said that since we were sharing our apples, they would not be that big and the pizzas would be put straight into the oven, lessening the wait. Well....we waited for at least 20 minutes event after our appies were taken away before getting the main. Doesn't a wood fire oven only take about 90 seconds to cook a pizza? none the less, the wait time made me aggravated and hungry!  The Pizzas were tasty, but nothing special in my mind. All I can say is that I've had better and if I had to order the pizzas individually, I would not think it is worth the price. The desserts, which deemed to be fresh looked sad. The shape of the panna cotta (which I think was due to the cup shape) looks like it was melting, and the lemon on the tart was completely deformed with the curd completely melting off the crust. They both tasted good but I questioned the quality given their first impressions.  The one memorable thing was that the bartender went out of her way to make me a special drink... But other than that, I would much rather go to a place where socializing is not so difficult, service is more friendly, and the food will work itself out."}
{"text":"The Pizza here is great, especially the crust.  I am a big fan of a nicely charred wood oven crust.  The cheese and sauce on their pizza is excellent as well.  Service was a big off, and the toppings for the pizza are wierd.  But you can adjust it,  unlike the thick, greasy, overhyped, hipster pizza at Descendants (never go there).  I will be going back when i'm in the area.  Just avoid the flashy show off toppings."}
{"text":"Do you a favor and DO NOT order pizza from here. At least not for delivery. Pizzas were cold and one was undercooked. Oh, it was so salty that we were not able to finish. A pretty bad experience overall."}
{"text":"Perhaps the smoothest restaurant opening I've ever seen:  - Liquor license: check - Credit cards: check - Competent service: check  All in all, a great pizza experience.   The pizzas were simple but excellently prepared.   They're somewhat cute in the fact that they offer you only a $25 prix fixe including appetiser, pizza, and salad for $25.  It's a good deal, but they don't mention that you can get just a pizza a la carte.   Unless you've got a giant appetite, the prix fixe will be too much food.  They only have pizza as entrees - nothing else.  I have to mention the excellent service again - it was very attentive, professional, knowledgeable, and friendly.   Also, the place is very kid-friendly and even had high chairs two days after opening.   L'il Baci may lose this half of Leslieville.  They also do takeout."}
{"text":"Ooooo I love it here!  Came here for a late date with moro mu. Unfortunately, I had already eaten dinner, but he was hungry so we ordered a pizza and some wine.   The service and ambiance here is top notch. Very hipster-ish but who cares! Most of the seating is upstairs and the place looks like an old renovated factory ot loft type space. Dim lighting, soft music and a giant pizza oven at the back.  Menu is simple - 12 or so types of pizzas. They also do a prix fixe for $27 with a variety of appetizers and desserts, but the pizza itself is so huge it seems foolish to order more.   The pizza was delicious, very thin crust in the middle but a bit soft chewy edge. Toppings were simple yet flavourful.   We also tried a dessert crepe with banana, mascarpone cheese and nutella. Yum!   Small but reasonable wine list here, mostly Italian wines (duh).   Our server was very attentive but not annoying.  Already can't wait to go back when I'm properly hungry!"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok. Service is ashaming. Management of the place in terms of quality and speed of service is a joke."}
{"text":"I think Libretto and Queen Margherita are pretty on par with their pizza offerings, but I do like QM's setting more and the fact they take reservations. I think the namesake pizza also has an edge over Libretto, but the best overall pizza, the chili one, can be found at Libretto. All things considered, it's a draw, and you can't go wrong with either."}
{"text":"Meh. That about sums it up. Need more? Poor service and sloppily cooked pizzas = I'm not wasting any more money at QMP.  Service: 10-15 minute wait on a Friday night. That's actually reasonable considering it's a popular place and we didn't have any reservations, so no issues there. 15-20 minutes after we were seated, no one had come by to give us menus, take our drink orders or even acknowledge us. That's unreasonable. The host finally came by to check on us and he ended up taking our drink and dinner orders. Then the bartender gave me the wrong drink, but quickly rectified it once I pointed it out. He also gave us cutlery, bread and plates and served us our pizzas after another 15 minutes. Then our waitress came by at the end, cleared half the plates and gave us the bill. This ain't rocket science. The host seats you and hands you menus. The waiter comes by to give you the specials and take your drink orders. The bus boy brings the water. How is it that none of this happened?  Pizza: C'mon man, if you're gonna claim to make good pizza, then you'd better deliver. What's w/ the pizzas that have ingredients clustered together in spots rather than evenly distributed? Why's the anchovies on one side, the capers somewhere else and the olives off on their own? Is this supposed to be \"rustic\"? That's not rustic, that's sloppily made pizza. How come the dough isn't charred properly on the bottom, making the pizza soft and overly chewy instead of crusty and sturdy enough to support the toppings? Even I know you check a pizza's doneness by looking at the bottom to ensure the crust is evenly charred. The ingredients themselves are good and tasty, but if you can't cook the pizza right, you'll get people like me calling you out for making and serving poorly cooked pies.  UPDATE: In contrast to QMP, We went to Totonnos on the UES in NYC. We were seated immediately, given menus and drink orders taken quickly. Drinks arrived, margherita pizza w/ sundried tomatoes and kalamata olives on one half ordered. 10 min. later, our pizza arrived. Crust was thin, crusty all the way through, properly charred and not soggy in the middle. Toppings distributed evenly so every bite contained sundried tomatoes and olives. The sauce was tasty, the mozzarella was more stringy than creamy (I prefer creamy, but oh well), and the soft drinks were refilled for free. And Totonno's is not even close to the best brick oven pizzeria in NYC, just the one that was closest to us. Are you listening QMP? That's how you do it.  tl,dr; Go to Libretto or Mercatto or even Pizzaiola. Or just make your own, it's not that hard. Steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"Anticipating the opening of Queen Margherita's new location at Jane and Annette! It's just what the hood needs. Hope it's just as good. My only question is, why does their website blow?"}
{"text":"The location is a little far from downtown but it was interesting to see a lower scale, more \"neighborhood\" part of Toronto. As for the restaurant, it seems hip and cool which was fun. But you have to pay a little extra for that.  We had a romaine salad to start which was nothing special. They could have put more lettuce in it to justify the price.  The pizza was very good though. My son's plain margherita pizza was excellent. The key is the dough.  Soft but not too filling.  Really well done. The rest of the family shared two Gio Oldschool pizzas. Awesome. The ingredients were really fresh. It was excellent. Not oldschool if you ask me.  I had a nice Belgian wheat beer. And for dessert, some kind of chocolate tort thing with ice cream. Strange ice cream. It held together but wasn't cold. Is that normal in Toronto?   Overall I really liked it and we had fun but it was a touch pricey."}
{"text":"i keep on coming back to this place. they know how to make a great thin crust and saucy pizza. toppings are fresh and unique. happy to see a great restaurant in an awesome part of town."}
{"text":"Came here unannounced with a large group of 30+ pizza. The place was pretty empty, even for a Monday night. Which was perfect, so that they could accommodate us as we filled up half the room.  Ordered the grilled kale salad (delicious: nutty with a tang of acidity and the indescribable deliciousness of pine nus) and the salumi board (also yummy but wasn't mindblowing: large slices of cured meat, with some sliced baguette, poached pears and slightly, burnt roasted hazelnuts).  First time I came I had the calamari (yummy but greasy: large portion of pure fried calamari. I needed some more greens in my app, and kind of heavy before a pizza main) and the Caprese Salad (so amazing omg: juicy wedges of tomatoes, thick mozzarella slices and the light, aroma of basil and olive oil mmmmhhh), whose light refreshing flavor was a great balance to the Calamari. Although the more recent time I came, they took it off the menu.  My main was the La Scala pizza, with delicious shredded pork, a generous heaping of arugula and some other toppings. Soooo delicious. But huge portions. I took most of it home to my boyfriend, who was passed out in front of the TV. He woke up, devoured the pizza, and went back to sleep. Not sure if he remembers eating it, but pretty sure he enjoyed it. Anyway.  But I've also tried The Dominator, where the bitter Rapini overpowered all the other flavours. The fennel sausage was pretty so-so. Didn't love it at all.  The pizzas are large, flat, thin-crust and cooked in a stone oven. But slightly burnt in places both times.   Overall, I'd recommend this place as good pizza, but a bit pricy (La Scala was $20!) for what it is. There are definitely places in Toronto that offer good pizzas for cheaper.  And while the décor is chic and industrial, it is wayyy too empty both times I've been for me to want to bring my friends."}
{"text":"Queen Margherita is our go-to pizza spot for a family night out, since 2010. The atmosphere is casual, comfortable, and family friendly, with great service to boot. The prix-fixe menu can't be beat (although the price has creeped up over the years), and the pizza satisfies every time. Honestly, we've never had a bad dish or meal here from the appetizers to desserts, and (of course) pizzas in-between. Some of our favourites are the grilled kale salad, the diavolo or rocco pizzas, and the nutella mousse. Make sure you ask for some spicy oil to dip your crust in!"}
{"text":"In the war of thin crust pizza joints in Toronto, QMP does not have the historical significance of Terroni, nor the shiny marketing prowess of the Libretto famiglia, but it is truly and consistently always the tastiest thin pie in the city.   There's great pizza, great service and a prix fixe that always leaves me stuffed. The prix fixe is the best deal because it runs $27 for an appetizer, any pizza on the list and a dessert. For hungry patrons, the meatball appetizers tends to be smaller (only 2 meatballs per dish) than other dishes. I highly recommend any arugula salad specials as the dressing is always paired perfectly with the bitterness of the salad.   Favourite pizza? Hands down La Scala. Just like the opera house of its namesake, it is a white pizza with fior di latte, arugula, red onion, hot peppers, asiago and...wait for it, sweet pork belly! What's not to love?  Half the pizzas (maybe gross estimation) have fior di latte (ie cow mozzarella) on it, so if you don't like that type of cheese, definitely go elsewhere. The thin crust dough is chewy and never dry. The other pizzas with a tomato based red sauces are also stellar. My other favourites are Giovanni (with prosciutto di Parma) and Capricciosa (wit hprosciutto cotto).   Sit upstairs and enjoy the beautiful windows in any given season. The only downside to QMP is that their cocktails aren't terribly inventive - there's always something with campari or aperol - and their wine list is so-so, but it's never claimed to be anything more than a great neighbourhood pizza joint."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place based solely on reviews from friends who swore up and down that Queen Margherita was THE place to get pizza. Perhaps my anticipation was the reason I was let down, or if my standard for pizza is just that high... I enjoyed the prix fixe lunch, ordered the arugula salad, the pizza with goat cheese & mushrooms (sorry, memory lapse for the name of the pizza) & the nutella mousse. The salad was AMAZING and probably wouldve ordered a lunch size one had I known the pizza would be so mediocre... I also had a slice of my friends pizza with prosciutto & arugula, and still wasnt blown away... Read: pizza was good, not great, and therefore a letdown. Would I go back & eat pizza? Sure. But next time Ill know what to expect & maybe disappointment wont take away from the taste..."}
{"text":"We were undeniably shocked at the poor service we received at this location. Yes, the pizza was good, but this place does not know how to hold a reservation. A 6:30 reservation does not mean you have to wait until 7:20 to get seated! It also does not mean you wait until almost 8:30 until you start eating. Additionally, the restaurant was packed with people standing around, waiting to be seated, when they should have been outside. It's not fun to sit at your table with some guy's rear end rubbing against you! This restaurant also clearly has a major take-out business going. There were dozens of pizza boxes being shipped out, often to Uber Eats couriers, while we waited forever to be served. We're skipping this place from now on."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner here and our kids didn't complain. The end.   We were seated right away in the front portion of the restaurant, by the bar. There's a big room attached, with way more seating than it initially appears when you walk in. We got giant meatballs for apps (kids were starving) and they were delicious. Kids got margherita pizzas, which they liked. I love the spicy sopresseta & olive red pizza. Their desserts come in little jars (tiramisu and the like) and are delicious.  I've ordered the pizza a few more times when I've been in town for work. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza that doesn't disappoint!  Was here last night, came in around 8:30pm and there wasn't a wait at all. Mind you it was 8:30pm and it was also Tuesday night with a snow storm going down.  Had the 'Roberto' Pizza which was Porchetta and hot peppers basically... and it was delicious!  Their pizza oven is flown in directly from Italy and produces top notch pizza.  Its pretty much about $18 for a personal size pizza which should fill you up. But you can add an app and a dessert for another $7.. Great value in my opinion.  Great Pizza, Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time was a great experience- good food, service etc. The second time was an extreme disappointment. The server was the rudest person Ive encountered in my life. She was extremely condescending and unhelpful- rolling her eyes when asked about the menu, throwing the drinks on the table, acting like she owns the place  etc. After being confronted by her (and being called aggressive..wtf?) we were told the meal was on the house..which was the only good part of the night. I don't normally write reviews..but this place stood out .. the food was good but the management needs to think twice about who they hire..the bad service ruined my night"}
{"text":"Ate here this past weekend for my birthday with my boyfriend. We made a reservation for 8 o clock (it is busy at this time particularly on a Sat night). We had the prix fixe menu which included 1 starter, 1 pizza and 1 dessert for $29. For starters we had the potato and cheese croquettes which were very good. We ordered the Capricciosa pizza (prosciutto & mushroom) the crust was so thin which I love, I would have like a bit more cheese on it however, I'm not a fan of too much cheese but I would have liked a little more on this as one or two of the slices had barely any on it. We had ice cream with chocolate sauce for dessert, it was yummy.  The only down side to the experience really for me was we were seated downstairs and it was super cold so I was shivering the whole way through my meal as people came in and out the door. Service was good."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I wanted to try a more true Italian / authentic pizzeria experience.  So far our pizza experience has been Magic Oven, Pizza Hut, Boston Pizza, 2 for 1, Mama's Pizza, RichTree pizza and a ton of Pizza Pizza.  We have been anticipating the opening of this restaurant about a month prior to its opening.  The restaurant's ambiance and decor are beautiful, it's kind of like a loft feeling, spacious, high ceilings and a kind of panoramic view of Queen St.  The servers are not your white blouse, black pants kind of servers, which adds to the feel of the restaurant.  Very nice service too I must add.  We ordered the fixed price menu, (refer to the picture I uploaded) for $25 and drinks on top.  Their antipasti was good, we really enjoyed the Prosciutto but I really felt that this entire course was unnecessary.  Usually eating these small appetizer/tapas type dishes and drinking wine is quite the experience, but then when the two huge pizzas come, it's just too much and the appetizer doesn't lead into the main dish very well.  We ordered a margarita and the fungi pizza, which is a mushroom vegetarian pizza.  The pizza crust was very good, the taste and consistency reminds me of fresh naan.  The margarita pizza had these two basil leaves that looked very nice but was very disappointing in taste.  I didn't taste any flavour, it felt like there's not much more that was added to the pizza other than the mozarella balls.  (I love cheese pizza, but this one was just lacking).  The fungi misti (mushroom) pizza was much better with the earthy taste of mushrooms, but it still felt like it was missing something... perhaps some more spice or hot sauce.  There was just too much pizza too, the both of  us ate the equivalent of 1 pizza.  The last course, I don't even think I can review that, we were stuffed and then they serve us salad.  We didn't even want to touch it.  When it comes down to it, go here for the pizza and maybe a glass of wine, but stop at that.  Or do take-out - the pizza even tastes great after being microwaved as left-overs, which is not something I can say about most of the pizzas I've tried."}
{"text":"So much food! I ordered a prix fixe and ended up taking half of my pizza and my dessert home. My husband took half of his pizza home too. Really lovely servers, especially ours who knew the menu inside and out. Fantastic diet coke. Which sounds like an insignificant thing but so many places let it go flat/have the wrong mix. My husband had the pale ale that our server recommended and thought it was good. I chose a romaine salad for my starter which was really good and enough for two. I had the margherita pizza which was lovely and my husband got one with prosciutto topped with arugula (enough for me to put some on my pizza). The server was very attentive to us and timed the food perfectly. The only negative thing was the washroom which was through what may have been a separate entrance to the building, off the dining room. It was a bland and cold corridor (although the cold is only seasonal) which was in contrast to the attention to detail they'd put into the rest of the restaurant. Prix fixe plus an additional pizza, 1 diet coke and 1 beer was less than $70 including tip. And we'll get two more meals out of this one! Would go back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"The following is an excerpt from pizza.about.com  \"Neapolitan pizza, or pizza Napolatena, is a type of pizza that originated in Naples, Italy. Neapolitan pizza is made from simple and fresh ingredients: a basic dough, raw tomatoes, fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and olive oil--no fancy toppings here. One of its defining characteristics is that there is often more sauce than cheese, leaving the middle of the pie wet or soggy and not conducive to being served by the slice\".  The pizza we had from QMP: Basic dough? Check Raw tomatoes? Well, not quite. They didnt taste fresh or alternatively cooked down enough to bring out the flavour.  Fresh mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and olive oil? Check Wet and soggy pie middle? Check and check!  What I'm wondering is why with the ingredients all there, did my Margherita pizza taste so bland? I've had Napolitana pizza, in Naples and it was mind blowing with more of a bruschetta taste with bright flavours and it came to the outside cafe piping hot! Our QMP pizza was near room temp forcing me to eat quickly because I dislike cold pizza unless it's leftover from a decent takeout and even then I'll tear it up and make it into a savoury bread pudding with eggs and extra cheese baked in extra large muffin cups the next morning.   What I'm also wondering is why this place is getting a consistent overall 4 star rating. Were we there on an off day? Was someone new in the kitchen? Friday is THE pizza night almost anywhere in the city so it should have been \"game on!\"  Wait staff was pleasant enough but didn't hesitate to inform us that they needed our table cleared before 7:15. We arrived at 5:50, pizzas were served to us in a scant 10 minutes and we were out the door at 6:20. It was weird but we left with a profound sense of sadness and bewilderment.  P.S. This review was drafted over 3 months ago so things may have improved."}
{"text":"Great value for their prix fixe option! The gluten free dough is amazing and the extra $3 is worth it compared to other restaurants that charge that or more for a frozen dough that they bought from elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about ! We were in the area visiting the beaches jazz festival and got hungry around 4 PM, this was probably one of the first places that came to mind from my bookmarks list. We were seated downstairs and I think the bartender served us (yes, she is loud!). We had their pre-fixe lunch menu which is a no-brainer to me for $20. We shared arugula salad with mushrooms and balsamic, Margherita Doppio and a Nutella mousse.   We actually wanted to have the pesto pizza but our server strongly advised us against it citing something was off. Why do they have it on the menu until they fix the problem?  The salad was quite depressing, it had so much potential but it wasnt dressed well. The mushrooms had no flavor whatsoever.   The pizza was just about ok, having returned from a trip to Naples, we had high standards for neapolitan pizza.   The best part of the meal was the Nutella mousse. It was airy and delicious! I can come back to this place just for this dessert which is a sad testament for a pizza place.  Also, I don't get it when these guys make such a fuss about publishing their menu online. It's a pizza place for pizza's sake! It's not like their menu changes that often that they find it difficult to keep up with it. Sorry QMP you just don't meet the bar for what a high quality Neapolitan pizza should taste like."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time last night, and would say my experience was a solid \"good\". Not amazing, but good.  My boyfriend and I called ahead to make a reservation for 8pm, yet when we got there our table wasn't ready. The host said it would be 5 minutes, and then proceeded to ignore us while chatting up some regulars. Not impressed. As we were about to leave, the host called us over and led us to the upstairs dining room - 15 minutes later than our reservation. I have no problem waiting without a reservation, but come on...you call ahead, you don't wait. That's my expectation.   The upstairs dining room has a great atmosphere, but was disappointed to be seated next to the bathrooms. Another strike. But as soon as the host left, the experience got better. We had a great, friendly waitress who delivered our prix fixe menu at a good pace.   App - Ricotta drizzled with honey, cranberries and arugala - the perfect size to share (for two people without a huge appetite). Yum.  Main - Margherita Pizza. Delicious, perfectly baked, amazing sauce and herbs.  Dessert - Lemon gelato. The perfect way to finish it off. Light, tart and refreshing.  I would go back in a second, and I would recommend this to everyone. Very reasonable prices, tasty food, amazing pizza, decent wine selection, and great atmosphere. But if I make a reservation and have to wait again, I'm walking out the door."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch/early supper today at Queen Margherita Pizza.  I love love love pizza and ordered a Calabrese pizza ... I swapped the Parmigiano cheese for fior di latte.  It was a really good pizza.  The crust was soft and chewy.  There was lots of sauce and it was tasty.  I was expecting the garlic to be in small chunks but it was in thin slivers, which worked well.  I had gotten mild cacciatore and it was good ... I will try spicy next time.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Boring and Burned Pizza! We met 4 friends for dinner there on Thursday night, each of us ordered a different pizza to share. They all tasted similar and boring - except the meat one had some spice to it. Service was dismal although handsome, and he did not know what beers were available and did not come back to ask how our meal was until he saw the pile of burnt pizza crusts that we all left. Pizza was quite burnt around the edges with a soggy interior, really? Totally Underwhelming for our night out while in Toronto."}
{"text":"I have been here number of times and the quality of food and service was great each time. The unique quality of this place is the authenticity of the pizza they produce. Having been to Naples, I believe that this place is the closest competitor of Neapolitan style pizza that you will find anywhere in Toronto.  Their pizzas are soft as a cloud, be gentle before you crush the delicate crust with your dull and coarse fingers. Slight charring over the pale crust gently reflects the metaphor of your current life versus your hopes and aspirations. Sauce is light and perfectly sweet; the charred bitter crust perfectly balances out the sweetness. The overall quality of food is great. Although price can be a little high, its fair in comparison to the food that you will be receiving.  This is the place you want to go if you are looking for an authentic Neapolitan pizza."}
{"text":"I always forget to review this place after going.  From the few nepolitan pizza joints in Toronto, Queen M has the highest value. Not the highest taste, but definately up there.   The 3 course prix fix menu at $27 is a steal. The appetizers are always excellent and the deserts are quite good. The choices of pizza's are high on flavour. The best part has to be their dough. Cooked just the way i personally like it. Thin and flat but with a nice crust all around that you can actually eat without chipping teeth.    This is a good place to come for a simple evening date, or for a larger group. The upstairs area seats quite a bit.  It's also nice eating in the east end, away from all the rush and traffic."}
{"text":"Pros: - Friend and helpful service - Nice and clean interior - Pizza was alright for the most part  Cons: - Pizza crust tasted burnt for the most part - A little pricey for the size of the pizza  Ordered: $15 Margherita - Not bad. Nice subtle flavours $19 Alla Campagnolo - The best tasting of the 3. $20 Gio Oldschool - Not bad.   Conclusion: We came here on a weekday night. The restaurant wasn't very busy so we were seated and served very quickly. Our server was very friendly, helpful and quick which was great.   The pizza for the most part was alright. You can tell that they use quality produce and that the pizza is made with a high standard. The main issue I had with the pizza was the crust. Although it didn't look burnt, there was a slight hint of burnt flavour with every bite. It wasn't overpowering but is enough to notice and question. Scraping off the burnt parts helped a bit. With that being my first visit and experience, the burnt flavour and price will probably have me looking elsewhere for pizza. I am a little hesitant to recommend Queen Margherita Pizza."}
{"text":"Out of all the pizza parlour that I've been to in Toronto, QMP really stood out of them all :D Love the soft chewy pita-like dough (not dry at all), fresh toppings, exclusive mozzarella cheese made in Ontario, and superb taste!  My friend and I were here for a late dinner on a Friday night at around 10pm. Restaurant is still extremely packed with customers. Noise level is through the roof! Be prepared to scream at across the table lol. Wouldn't be the best spot for a romantic date, but no doubt, BEST pizza in the east end! Lots of people did take outs as well :)  We were quickly seated upstairs with a nice view of the 900° wood fired pizza oven (It is GIGANTIC!!). Starving, we ordered 2 hand tossed pizza right off the bat. BTW, service was quick and courteous and food literally flew out of the kitchen XD  We ordered a white pizza called La Scala with juicy pork belly goodness, sweet onions, hot pepper, arugula, and lots of melts-in-your-mouth fior di latte (exclusive cheese as mentioned earlier!). So delicious :D We also ordered the Calbrese pizza with parmigiano reggiano, with spicy sausage and tomato sauce... unfortunately, I'm not a big fan of spicy food (Yes, I've been told that I'm missing out lol.), but my friend really liked it and added even more chili flakes o_o #sourstomach  Ended our meal off with the lemon tart with whipped cream, and the cannoli filled with mascarpone cream topped with a scoop of dark chocolate ice cream. Both tasted so fresh #yum!  Definitely a returning customer, and I highly recommend this place if you have a crave for pizza!"}
{"text":"Great dinner! Had the la Scala (with pulled pork) and it was phenomenal. Received excellent service from micheal. He combined my pizza with my friend's appetizer to create a combo, which saved us a few bucks! He also threw in an extra dessert for free!"}
{"text":"I am shocked to see any ratings lower than five stars.  This is some of the best pizza I have ever had.  We are in town for three days and will dine here twice.  And yes, it might appear as though I am mailing this review in, but in truth how effusive can one be about a kick #@# Margherita pizza?  Yes, it is insanely delicious, but beyond that?"}
{"text":"The pizza here was delicious and there is a good selection of choices. Better than average wine list too. Lots of seating but mostly downstairs in the back near the big oven. Service is friendly but a bit slow because this is a busy spot. Easy to reach on the Dundas Streetcar or on the Bathurst car. Reservations would be a good idea."}
{"text":"QMP is my fave Pizzeria in Toronto.  The pizza taste and authenticity of the Napolitano pizza is equal to Libretto however the value, consistency and atmosphere are better at QMP.  We vacation in southern Italy every year and eat at Da Michele in Napoli.....this pizza is as close as you're going to get to that benchmark and it's better than  many Napolitano pizza we've had in Italy. ....If it had a patio I would probably eat there every day in the summer. Mauro"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I've felt like... maybe I ordered the wrong thing? I want the food to be better than what I've had because I like the idea of Queen Margherita.  First attempt: When they first opened, Kat F and I dined upstairs on the prix-fixe menu ($25 for app, pizza, dessert). I wasn't really that into my iceburg wedge, bleu-cheese salad but the prosciutto arugula pizza was meh-to-okay.  The prosciutto was room temperature/cold so I wondered if they'd put it on after it was already cooked? The dining room is nice but it's concrete/windows so it's as loud as salad king (if not louder). I couldn't eat any of the desserts because they all had dairy so they were very accommodating in offering me a fresh berry bowl instead, and it was alright. They were ready to go when they opened (professional, no opening week slip ups) but I just didn't like my food that much. I filed this under \"to try again later.\"  Second attempt: After a stunning pizza at Pizzeria Delfina in San Francisco last week (Kat F and I eat a lot of Pizza together... it's an omnivorous food) (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pizzeria-delfina-san-francisco-3) when I came home I had a hankering for a similar pie.  I thought that I would hit Queen Margherita for a second go around in hopes that it could satiate my craving. In short: it did not.  The good: - The iceburg/bleu cheese appetizer is gone from the menu (the apps selection looked decent - there were 2/4 things I actually wanted as opposed to selecting the thing I did not want the least, like I did last time) - The staff was nice and welcoming (and kind of cute) - They take debit and credit (no amex) - Proximity to my house  The bad: - No online menu. This is unspeakably annoying. When I got there, the menus were laminated, so it's not like they can possibly be changing that much. I wish I has been able to pick my pizza and call in my order, but I had no idea what they had! - The pizza I had today didn't come with tomato sauce. Maybe that's my bad for not looking at the menu closely enough (or not understanding the words?) but I was devastated by this unfortunate twist of fate. (I have a theory that I am not meant to be happy with take out pizza). - The pizza was expensive.  $21 for a ~12\" pie that would be about 8 slices at a pizza chain. - It wasn't the best.  It WAS A LOT BETTER than Dominos or Pizza Pizza, but I wouldn't say it was better than Buca or Lil' Baci at all. I feel like I may have (again) ordered the wrong thing. It was pathetic and meager compared to Pizzeria Delfino. - 2 parties arrived as I was waiting - a party of 7 loud, obnoxious hockey loving family members, the loudest (and largest!) of whom managed to jostle and bump me as he thunder-stomped by, even though I was the ONLY person in the room, sitting at the bar, not even close to the stairs they needed to use to make their way to the unbearably echoey dining room. The second party was two women who were rude to the staff (\"two.\" *stomps up the stairs without the hostess even having a chance to say right this way*).  Obviously... this isn't the venue's fault, but I vaguely remember it being full of assholes last time I ate here too. You can infer that it's \"not my crowd\" if you like.  Overall... I will probably never go here again. It's expensive, I apparently never order the right thing (how many wrong things can there be?) and I haven't ever had a good food experience here, although the staff have always been outstanding.    From what I saw today, there seem to be enough GTL buttheads patronizing it to keep it in business."}
{"text":"Read about this place in Toronto Life as one of the top places for 2011.  Arrived and were told a table would be 30 minutes.  After about 15 mins our table was read - the place was packed on a Friday night, with no reservations we did well to get in quickly.  Ordered 2 \"price fixed\" orders, which includes a starter, pizza, and a desert.  No drinks.  The starter #1 was the Watermelon + mint salad which is very good, and simple.  We liked it so much we've made it at home a few times since.  Dead simple, but tasty and refreshing in the summer.  The pizzas were both different, but both shared a common flaw - the underside of the dough needs to be toasted and browned a little more.  They leave it too soft, and it's even hard to manage with a knife/fork since it's quite soft.  Hands work better.  Would love for the pizza to be a little crunchier with the dough.  Taste was good, nothing amazing, but you can tell they use good ingredients.  Desert was a sorbet type thing, not bad.  Again for summer, good choices from the chef.  We ordered a few beers and a glass of wine each - total bill was $120 with tip for the 2 of us.  Will return for more."}
{"text":"A large section of Queen St East right now is under construction, making it very difficult to visit Queen Margherita.  However, after one streetcar, one bus, and a short walk,  we were glad that we ventured all the way out.  The space is large and inviting, it must have been an old factory because it had an industrial vibe.  To start the meal we had a lemonata, iced tea, and a glass of prosecco.  They do have a prix fixe option, but we opted for ordering off of the menu.  To start, we shared a buffalo mozzarella salad with confit tomatoes, greens, and prosciutto de parma.  The salad was deconstructed however it more resembled a charcuterie than a salad plate.  The cheese had great texture, it was slightly springy and wasn't overpowering in taste.  The confit tomatoes were sweet, and just fell apart in the mouth.  The prosciutto was perfectly sliced and deliciously salty, a good balance with the mellow cheese.The balsamic was the glue to the dish and it was delicious.  I like the contrasts of white and sauced pizzas, we ordered the four cheese Bianca and then the pizza with sauce and mushrooms.  When you have a pizza that just consists of cheese, there is nothing to hide behind, if the cheese is poor quality then the pizza will reflect that.  Some of the mozzarella wasn't completely melted which added some texture.  The blue cheese was placed in four spots on the pizza which was a clever way of not overpowering the palette. The red pizza was delicious as well.  The crust was thin and blistered from the oven.  I love the mozzarella that they use on the Pizza, combined with the earthy mushrooms, it was a hit.   The service was attentive and friendly.  One complaint was that since we were sharing the pizzas, by the time we were ready for the second pizza it had turned cold.  I wish that they would have spaced the pizzas, even by five minutes, it would have made the pizzas that much more enjoyable. Overall Queen Margherita serves up delicious, authentic pizzas at a reasonable price.  The pizzas are simple, and they let the true ingredients shine.  Truthfully i don't know if it merits the long trip out, but if i am back in the neighbourhood i would definitely stop in for a pie."}
{"text":"Our server was very good and super friendly.   Now onto the pizza. I ordered the old school. It is a prosciutto pizza with a large pile of arugula on top making it a bit hard to eat. I ended up moving the arugula to the side and adding a few leaves to each bite.   The good:The sauce is one of the the best tomato sauces I've tasted, very fresh and tomato-y.  The prosciutto was also good.  Not so good: the crust. I was expecting a thinner and fluffier crust because of the words \"authentic Neapolitan\" on the front window. However, it was too bread-y and chewy. To me the crust is the main thing i notice on a pizza.  My weighted score 60% crust - 2 out of 5 20% sauce - 5 out of 5 20% cheese + topping - 3 out of 5  over all 2.8 / 5 stars.  For the price point , there are better options in the city for Neapolitan pizzas."}
{"text":"The food is good, and the servers are great.  The actual restaurant is very cute.  Unfortunately, the hosts we had were useless.  We ended up waiting for 1 hour and 45 minutes for a table.  We specifically requested an upstairs table and in the end had to settle for a table on the crowded main floor.  After expressing our dissatisfaction at the hosts' apathy to our situation, the manager ended up comping a round of drinks.  One major problem with this restaurant is there is no area to wait for a table and considering how busy it it, this is an issue."}
{"text":"I received a couple of vouchers from Queen Margherita in October for #PizzaMonth. I have been following their social media for awhile but never had the opportunity to visit until last month.  Queen Margherita has three locations in Toronto, including one in Leslieville and another in Baby Point. I opted to visit their Dundas West location because it was most convenient for me. The first thing that struck out to me was the space of the restaurant. It has two floors. Above ground there are a decent number of seats, which you can see from the outside. But when you go to the lower level, it's massive. They have an open concept kitchen, which I thought was really cool because you could see the stone oven and their chefs working away. The restaurant has that urban posh feel, which I really liked.  Their menu consist of prix fixe appetizers and a variety of pizzas. My voucher only allowed for one margherita pizza so I didn't try anything else because it was already filling (I ended up taking half of it home). The pizza was good, though it wasn't something I was wowed by. I prefer to have a lot more toppings on my pizza but if you like the classic margherita pizza, you would definitely enjoy this signature dish.  Queen Margherita's Dundas West location makes for a great date or a place to host a birthday party due to size and a menu with a variety of pizzas to choose from."}
{"text":"The crust was nothing special, in fact the entire pizza seemed a little undercooked and soggy.  I wasn't a fan of the sauce, but that could just be my personal preference.  The quality of the toppings was pretty good though.  More 'authentic' than most pizzerias, but that's not necessarily a good thing.  There are certainly times when authentic is better, but in some cases (and I feel like this is one of them) it feels as if they are going the authentic route to appeal to the pretentious among us.  That's not really a reason I can stand behind.  You know the type: Those who are quick to criticize your restaurant choice because it's just not authentic enough.  Those who will rave about a place...that is, until it gets too popular, then they'll constantly remark how bad the place has gotten.  Those who feel that their choice of restaurant somehow reflects on their level of culture and sophistication.  Those who would balk at a restaurant for expanding outside of just the authentic cuisine. (God forbid a Thai restaurant offer a Vietnamese dish or an Indian restaurant offer tikka masala)  The toppings as a result are unnecessarily limited and boring.  There is no reason they can't expand beyond the traditional menu and provide a little variety.  And if someone complains that they've lost authenticity?  Well, they need to calm down.  We should be judging restaurants on their food, their service and to a lesser extent, their atmosphere and that's it.  I'm not suggesting they add burgers to the menu by any means.  That would be a fair criticism as providing too wide of a scope could jeopardize the quality of the food.  However, adding a few more styles of pizza does nothing of the sort.  I won't likely be back.  There are other options nearby that offer both the authentic styles as well as non-authentic.  The quality is just as good (if not better - their crust isn't soggy).  So when I sit my butt down and look at the menu I still have options open to me and can order the kind of pizza that suits my mood at the time instead of having some of those options eliminated for lack of 'authenticity'."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and we ordered the Prix Fixe deal to share, $29 for one appetizer, a full size pizza, and a dessert. A good deal to try their menu items if you don't just want to eat pizza. We also added another appetizer on the side.  Arancini ($12 to order an appetizer a la carte) This was pretty much a fried risotto ball, stuffed with ricotta, caramelized onions and parmigano. I couldn't really taste the mushrooms or onions, it was mostly just the risotto and cheese. It being fried added a nice crunch but I think I would have enjoyed it more if it was served hot as opposed to warm.  For the set, we ordered: Appetizer we ordered the Beef Carpaccio Slices of beef served with herbed breadcrumb, oyster mushrooms, truffile oil and sprinkles of parmigano. I personally didn't enjoy this as much because of the flavors wasn't much of my liking. Pizza we ordered the \"Gio Oldschool\" Ingredients include cherry tomatoes, prosciutto and arugula. The pizza was good, all the ingredients went well with each other. I would have liked the pizza crust to be more crispy as opposed to chewy. As for dessert we had the Pistachio Cheesecake. Essentially it was a New York cheesecake with pistachios sprinkled on the top. This was actually my favorite dish for the night - rich cheese flavor but not tasting too heavy. Loved the baked crust at the bottom.   Overall the meal was enjoyable but nothing special imo. I would prefer Pizza Libretto."}
{"text":"Came here for a work Christmas dinner and I will definitely be coming back. There is a prix fix menu$30 for appy, any pizza and dessert.   The kale salad was HUGE and delicious, other appy options included mussels, calamari, and various salads...from what I can remember.   The pizza was thin crust with a slightly charred crust and soooooo good. I got the Rocco and the Gorgonzola cheese on it paired so well with the sausage and onions. Highly recommend giving this a try!  For dessert I shared the ricotta cheese cake and Nutella mousse. They were both good, the cheesecake was very rich while the mouse was so light and airy.  We had a lovely dinner, wonderful service, and will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I just ordered a pizza from this place trough uber eats and it was completely burnt and inedible (see picture). I tried to call queen margherita pizza to see I could return this pizza but they don't answer their phones and the voicemail directs you to make your reservations online so no opportunity to speak to a human being in order to correct any delivery issues. This means I'll likely have to drive this back to them tomorrow to get a refund."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's not crazy cheap or anything but great atmosphere especially if you sit in the upper part of the restaurant with a view of the trains. Beautiful wines and pizzas, rustic style, thin crust.  Also got an amazing carpaccio with fried capers that added an awesome salty crunch and drizzled with a spicy mayo. Happy to have this place in my hood!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to lots of brick-oven pizza restaurants.  And, Queen Margherita, is definitely one of our favorite places.  It is a little pricey but we felt that we got what we expected.  We have only been there once so whether it is consistent or now, we do not know...  We loved the doughy blister crust.  I like it chewy, not crusty.  I enjoyed the marinara sauce.  It was very sweet.  I love how they use San Marzano tomatoes.    We ordered the margherita pizza with the buffalo mozarella cheese.  We thought it was as good as it can get.  I tried going on their website to check out what the other pizza we ordered.  But, it was another vegetarian pizza.  Overall, we enjoyed it and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Has to be one of my favourite pizza places in Toronto. The service, quality of ingredients and atmosphere is worth the trip. If you can, order a few different pizza's to share, you won't regret having a few different options. I've been to both locations, both are great."}
{"text":"What I ordered: $30 Prix fixe menu including The Birdman, Eggplant Pizza, Pear and arugula pulled pork pizza, Italian sausage pizza  Also comes with appetizers and dessert  Pros: - Lots of areas to sit, this restaurant looks small on the outside but has a lower floor that's double the size.  - Of the appetizers, I would recommend the mussels- there's a generous serving compared to the other apps and it was delicious too.  - Of all the pizzas, I enjoyed the pulled pork pizza the most, great balance of sweet and savoury.  - Dessert: I would recommend the Nutella mousse, the flavour was subtle  and not too sweet.   Cons: - not really a con but The Birdman pizza might not be for everybody, it is literally a kale salad on a pizza. I believe that if you're going to eat pizza, you've committed to it being unhealthy but this was a confusing combination of in between healthy and not"}
{"text":"Decided to try their gluten free margherita pizza via ubereats. One of the biggest disappointments I've ever had with a pizza. Tasteless. A measly scattering of cheese on what should be a cheesy pizza (I even asked for extra cheese) The crust also had the weirdest taste to it.  All in all, don't order it. Makes me want to start eating wheat again.  If you're looking for a great gluten free pizza try Pizzaville. (that's what I'll be doing next time)"}
{"text":"very good pizza, staff are super cool, friendly helpful and willing to go the extra mile. have never eaten in (always take out) but the atmosphere here is nice and well designed resto."}
{"text":"Poor quality of food. Best way to describe the pizza is tomato soup poured onto cardboard.  Capers salad was fresh and delicious. Had to ask for bread which I'm surprised they don't offer it on the table.  Very disappointed in the pizza. Was expecting authentic Italian pizza as they claim to have. Not the case at al.  Very rubbery dough and very soggy pizza."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I've only ever eaten Queen Margherita Pizza (henceforth known as \"QMP\") via delivery. But 95%+ of the pizzas I eat are delivery/to-go pies (I am too ashamed at the speed and ferocity with which I eat pizza to do so in public), so I believe I have a well-calibrated standard for comparison.  At first glance, QMP's pizza looks like it could compete with the likes of Libretto and Maker, my current favorites. The crust is nice and bubbled and charred, and the toppings are the type that would qualify as \"premium\" add-ons at Domino's -- that is, if Domino's even offers them at all.   But something is clearly missing. The dough is bland, dry, and lacking in character. (Yes, I am anthropomorphizing my dough.) The sauce doesn't have any zing. And the toppings, at least on the pizzas I've tried, either don't mesh well or don't bring any life to the plate (there I go again, talking about my pizza like it's a person).  After 3 or 4 tries, I just gave up.  P.S.: I don't mean to slag on Domino's here -- I actually much prefer it to QMP and most other pizza places in the city. You really can't beat their pepperoni: sliced perfectly thin so it's crispy on the edges, and salty, oily, fatty and meaty in the middle."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I should lead with: I like places that are visually interesting.  Queen Margherita with its industrial-but-still-cozy vibe, open feel, massive windows?  Check.  I should follow the lead with: pizza is one of my all-time favourite foods, so this recommendation comes with many data points behind it.    If I'm *also* being open and honest I should say: I'm indecisive with my food, so I love that the menu at Queen Margherita is fairly limited. (despite that)  I still debate my choice of pizza every time, though the last three visits I've stuck to the Diavolo with extra chili oil (hot on hot; why mess with a great thing?).    Hasten here, say I!  Yelp note: using their online reservation system I've never had an issue with either securing a spot or getting seated when promised."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh pizza. Great service. And the prices and food is unbelievable. You can get the prix fixe and a few glasses of wine for such a great price. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"i was really excited to eat here, esp after hearing all the rave reviews. i loved the pizza in Naples and was surprised at how good the Libretto pizza was (not as good as the original, but the best version in toronto by far). we came here for a christmas dinner, and all ordered the prix fix. i got it  with the giovanni, my friends all ordered the rocco or romolo. there was a general consensus that it was pretty bad pizza. it was bland, the crust was too thick and chewy, all the toppings came off in one bite. the middle was soggy and the percuitto on my pizza wasn't very good. one person at the table who had never had Napoli style pizza before said that it was easily one of the worst pizzas he's ever had in his life (including frozen pizzas, dominoes, etc). i know what the pizza is supposed to taste like and have had Napoli pizzas around toronto - and this pie was subpar. the appetizer was a diavolo salad which was literally pieces of cheese, olives and cheese drizzled with olive oil. i normally would love this combination but this just didn't do anything for me. after dinner 3 out of 8 of us felt/were sick to our stomachs from the food! i woke up the next day still feeling sick. not good. would not recc. and would not return. on the other hand (also contrary to reviews) the service was great, and the dessert (lemon gelato) was delish. the resto had a nice atmosphere. however given the poor quality of food that does not come close to meeting expectations, Libretto remains #1 in my books for napoli style pizza. i do wish they took reservations though :("}
{"text":"The Good:  - beautiful space, tastefully renovated and decorated - friendly staff - delicious pizza crust  The Not So Good:  - You can't get appetizers (salads etc) unless you opt for the $25 prix fixe option (but I don't want dessert!!!) - Pizza was good, not great - crust was excellent, but I ordered a funghi pizza and the mushrooms looked like they came straight out of a can - while our server was friendly, he wasn't the most attentive - $32 with tax and tip for a pizza + tiny appetizer and dessert I didn't really want/need?  Overall I'd give it another shot, but if you're gonna charge those kinds of prices it'll take a bit more to keep me coming back.  Also, I should add that the 80's pop tunes blaring from the stereo kinda detracted from the experience - was totally out of place.  A welcome addition to the neighbourhood, hopefully they can tweak the menu/experience a bit."}
{"text":"Dinner with some work pals last night, did my usual consult of online reviews, results were not overwhelming. Further research uncovered it is one of 3 locations in hogtown (chainish). Concerned, I still accompanied my pals on the kilometer stroll from our office to the 'rant.  After some tough but productive negotiations inside, the menu choices were finalized. Two prix fixes which would include a fennel sausage red pizza and a green olive white pizza with arancini and caesar salad to start.   Starters: were on point, arancini was the perfect size and they even let us an add an additional ball to make four for our foursome. Salad was good, not memorable.   Pizzas: were great, cooked well, quality toppings. Lots of places making this neopolitan style these days but this was a solid performance. Chili oil didn't have the heat of a 1000 suns, but it had a nice heat.  Dessert: not a big fan in general, but the flour less cake was kind and the Nutella mousse was meh.  Overall: will return and get try the kale salad and keep everything the same"}
{"text":"I popped in here for two take away pizzas over the long weekend, and they were both scrumptious. We went for a traditional Margherita add parm and their Diavolo, which had fior di latte, sopressata, black olives and hot peppers.   This restaurant is much bigger than I had imagined. Two stories with two bars, lots of seating an their beautiful wood-fire stove on display in the lower level. Her Royal Highness appears to be good for a group, a date night or if you want to bring your kiddos. I shall return!"}
{"text":"Another one from the vacation file, and im pretty sure this is the last one, and I will be caught up. I came into this place on a whim and because I was in the area. very happy to say that this whim visit left me full and satisfied. right off the bat, I walked into the place to find it has a ground level which is a not very well lite bar situation with a tv, and a upper level with lots of windows and seating arrangement. I'm not sure how much time passed from the time I walked in until I was seated, but when I walked in, no one was on the ground level entrance, TV was on, dishwasher(I think) was going, but no one was around, what seemed like ten minutes, until I was finally approached for seating. I sat upstairs so I was such to have the light and people always around. right off the bat I noticed they had a daily lunch special going on, so rather then see the menu I asked for more information on that, a personal pizza and a app for 20 bucks(I  think) I was pre-occupied with my camera and the photos I just took of the don valley, so the time from ordering to the appetizer was a very quick time frame, calamari was absolutely outstanding, lightly coated and pretty fresh as far as I could tell. the waitress came by to pick up my plate in a quick and effortless fashion while putting on the table a jar of oil with peppers, I was warned in advanced, that the oil was a bit on the hot side, I took it with a grain of salt as I mixed up the peppers from the bottom to the top and took a smell, not bad! within minutes the pizza was put down at my table and it looks almost as good as it tastes(taste never lies) I took a single bite of the pizza and fell head over heels for it, but gently reminded myself that I had other business to attend to, such as tasting the pizza with this oil.   Stop... Stop the presses...  I almost stole from this place...  I know full well, the wonderful waitress gave me a warning that the oil is spicy, to me its not, but the flavor is like a next dimension for how DAMN good it is, by the time I finished my meal, a good layer of oil was left on the plate, and I got slightly depressed that I didn't have any bread to finish up the \"wasted\" oil. the waitress came over to collect my plate and asked me why I looked sad, I asked her if I could have the jar of oil, she said no, I asked if they could start selling it on the side, she said, it's been mentioned by all of our guests but the owner hopes people will keep coming back due to how awesome it tastes.  im hooked, line and sinker.   I paid my bill, thanked the lady very much and got out before I was arrested...haha.  in all seriousness, I can't understand how this place was dead, like 5 couples(or ten people) were in the whole restaurant...at the middle of the day...20 bucks for a seafood app and a wood fired pizza??!! are you kidding me??!!  although I had a bit of hiccup waiting in the beginning of this journey, I was thoroughly impressed with this place from start to finish, this restaurant and a couple of others make me wish I lived on the east side.   this place is great!!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with some friends & we all ordered the Prix Fix menu which is great value. Order the limonata....LOVED IT!!  I had the Rocco pizza & it was the best one from all the pizzas on our table.  The scala was good as well.  Calamari appetizer not good however the caprese salad & carpaccio are great choices.  Great sauce & cheese flavour however crust a little chewy.  Good taste but still think Terroni pizzeria is WAY better!  Our waiter was a little lost, Leonardo, and had to order my drink three times as he kept forgetting but he was a nice guy...just seemed too busy."}
{"text":"Great service!  The restaurant is large and is great for large parties.   I ordered a Margherita pizza which was was great except the crust, which was a bit more burnt that I like.   Would return!"}
