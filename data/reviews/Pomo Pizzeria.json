{"text":"After visiting Naples, Italy and experiencing true Neopolitan pizza, i can say Pomo's is the closest thing you will find to this amazing style of pizza. I've been to many pizza places in the scottsdale/phoenix area and by far this is the best and most authentic. If you have a chance, also try their mushroom soup - very good!"}
{"text":"Always consistent, high quality, delicious pizza and service. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"great food, great service.  authentic Italy one of the must stops in Scottsdale for food their sister restaurant next door is worth a visit as well"}
{"text":"5 stars for service, 3 stars for the food. I would like to give this restaurant two different ratings because the difference between the quality of service and the food was significant. We ordered a porcini pizza and had to hunt for the mushrooms. In fact it was sparsely populated with anything mentioned on the menu."}
{"text":"These folks know how to make pizza! Service is outstanding. A great place for a date or the whole family. Their other entries look great but their pizza is cosi dannatamente bene. Maybe next visit."}
{"text":"Great place for dinner.. Arrived at about 7:30 the place was packed we expected it would be a long wait and thought about finding another place for dinner. We walked in and were greeted warmly by the hostess told her we were two for dinner and she said just wait one minute . Brad a new recruit who had literally started that day showed us to our table. The place was very lively with many families and couples enjoying each other's company and the delicious foods that were delivered to their tables by the extremely well trained and efficient staff. The waitstaff work like a well oiled machine and flited about the room with smiles, the open kitchen environment that housed the wood burning oven put on an awesome show.  Our waitresses name was Tara she was fabulous and treated us as if we were the only table she had explaining the menu to us with patience and expertly answered all of our questions. She is a student and has been working there for four years.. She is a definite asset to your team!  We are on vacation in Arizona for the first time and really were searching for a great authentic place to have pizza and Italian fare. This place is definitely worth a repeat visit when we return Excellent food and service!"}
{"text":"Having lived in Italy this is my new favorite place great food good friendly service very authentic high quality food. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is friendly and attentive and management is great. I love the fresh authentic taste of the pizza. The atmosphere is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"I liked the bula over the principale.. But both were decent. Atmosphere was nice. Not the best for kids. Good location if you're staying at the Hyatt down the road. Two pizzas was $36!"}
{"text":"Per un italiano in viaggio all'estero la buona cucina ed il buon cibo sono sempre una spina nel fianco, egli vive col terrore di trascorrere giornate intere a digiuno o addirittura chiuso in bagno. Fortunatamente non è sempre così, durante il nostro ultimo viaggio negli Stati Uniti ci siamo imbattuti nella ridente cittadina di Scottsdale e incuriositi dal nome POMO pizzeria napoletana entriamo in una pizzeria situata nei pressi di Scottsdale rd. Una volta aperto l'uscio della porta siamo stati catapultati nei sapori, nei suoni e negli odori della nostra Italia. Il locale è curato nei minimi particolari, compresa una gigantografia affissa ad una parete con uno scorcio dei quartieri spagnoli di Napoli. La pizza vero cavallo di battaglia del locale non ha nulla da invidiare alle pizze delle migliori pizzerie della costiera amalfitana, gli ingredienti freschi e di qualità si sposano a meraviglia con un impasto tipico della tradizione napoletana. Il personale, le birre italiane ed un bel dolce sempre italiano hanno fatto da contorno ad una splendida cena Made in italy ma dall'altro capo del mondo. Consigliatissimo."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE pizza in the world. Ok, I've never been to Europe but I've had a lot of great pizza and this stuff is to die for! We tried a couple of kinds of toppings and the crust is awesome. It's like chewy and not overcooked. Service is very friendly and helpful with recommendations, and they happily boxed up our plentiful leftovers to take for lunch the following day."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have been coming here for over a year and I've never had a bad visit. It is a great first date spot because it is upper scale but still casual dining. I always request to be seated in Alex's section because he's a great server and a really nice guy.  I usually start with the bruschetta sorrentina; comes with two pieces so it's good for two people!  The pizza I usually stick with is the Toto Sapore which is an all meat pizza. The crust is nice and thin in the middle and a little thicker towards the edge and the crust itself tastes amazing!  I always end with a tiramisu. I love Italian food and I've had a lot of tiramisu's in my life and Pomo's tiramisu is, by far, the best I have ever had! I can't describe how good it it is, it's just something you have to try for yourself!  The only downside is that when I go to other Italian restaurants based around their pizza's I find myself comparing them to Pomo and I get disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love this place to death. Right down the street from my house and it's way better then their other two locations and way better then just about any pizza place I've been.  But for all things holy please invest in a half way decent bartender that knows how to make drinks outside of pouring wine and vodka and sodas. I come here all the time and seeing 2-3 people huddling up asking for ingredients or how to Make something is disturbing. My rating is solely on the pizza FYI."}
{"text":"Left POMO tonight very disappointed . Showed up at 6:30 pm without a reservation, and was quoted 45 minutes for a seat inside for a party of 7, and we specifically asked for a seat inside. After taking a seat at at the bar for 1:10 minutes, and watching 5 tables be given away, we asked if our table was ready. They said it was and walked us outside. We stated we specifically asked for a table inside due to the heat, and were told that all tables inside were reserved for the night and only outside tables would be an option. This was obviously very disappointing, and we left hungry. I can't comment on the food, but the customer service, and manager need help. I will skip this place in the future. There are far too many outstanding restaurants in Scottsdale to settle for a subpar experience such as this."}
{"text":"I used to go here at the old location in the Borgata and it was great.  I decided to order two pizzas to go from the new location and the service was terrible!  The person taking the to go order was so very rude.  She was short, kept saying \"huh\" and seemed like she had better things to do than take my order.  When I arrived and went the the bar area to pick up the order the same woman \"helped\" me.  She had the order wrong and said it was what I ordered.  I wanted 2 pizzas and she had 3 on the ticket.  She was again very short with me and just rude.  The pizzas were a little undercooked and soggy in the middle.  With so many great pizza places in the area I will not bother with this one again."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews, but we've tried this place three times and all three times service was really bad.  This last time we got seated on the patio, took 20 minutes for our waiter to greet us and get waters.  The two stars are for the ambiance and amazing patio/bar. We live very close to Pomo so really wanted to like this place, but you just can't ignore bad service and pizza crust burnt black. We will never come here again and will drive the extra miles to Mora."}
{"text":"Hadn't reviewed this place even though I have been there a dozen times or so. It's a staple for the area. Always good food and really good service. Very authentic too. I have to give it up for Pomos because they never disappoint me. All the pizzas are awesome. The menu changes sometimes and the new stuff is usually really good. The summer menu is always refreshing."}
{"text":"We really did not feel welcome here. We sat ourselves after being told to and were promptly forgotten about although there were people on each side of us. The old folks near us were throwing a fit that they did not get their regular table so everyone was trying to appease them and forgot that there were other patrons there.  We got up and got a drink at the bar saying no one had waited on us and asked for a menu.....still  no one came by. 10 minutes later we again asked for a server and finally got a young thing with an attitude. The pizza a salad were adequate but pricey and although it was a thin crust is wasn't quite done. Not sure if we will give it another try."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful patio and service!! Pizza and salads were amazing! Highly recommend this place for a fun night with friends."}
{"text":"I am writing this review based on the customer service as I did not have the opportunity to try the food. A party of 7 joined for dinner and we did not have a reservation. The only table that was immediately available was outside and with it being 6:00 and 100 degrees we decided to wait the estimated wait time of 45 to 60 minutes. After over an hour and fifteen minute wait and multiple requests for a estimated time that our table would be ready we were approached with a table that was ready. Okay finally right? No, the table was ready but it was indeed outside. WTF? We were just sitting outside at the fire pits drinking from their bar waiting for that table inside. Our first reaction of course was are you kidding me? We could have been eating over an hour ago. They offered us free desert but explained the tables inside were all reserved for the night (Sunday night). We felt extremely taken advantage of while running up a bar tab that we of course were required to pay for, manager came out to apologize but it was indeed too late. Would not return even if the meal was paid for. Too many options in a beautiful city. I would not recommend this restaurant if you are a walk in, or looking for quality customer service."}
{"text":"Thought id try this place. I'd seen it on a pizza list. The building is very nice as is the interior decor. We sat down and the waiter told about the wood fired oven that ran at 900 degrees. He said it only took 1 minute to cook a pizza.  We got the shrimp & Calamari app. It was excellent. I got the meat lovers pizza (they had a fancy Italian name for it). The toppings were good but overall I'd have to say it was just ok. My friend's pizza was the same way. They should have left it in a little longer!  You just don't expect a pie from a 900 degree brick oven to not be crispy, this was closer to doughy. All in all, pretty store, average pizza. I'd rather go to Pizza A Metro whose building is less than desirable but has excellent pizza. That's just me."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food. Organic salads. Mista salad is my favorite. Minestrone soup is the best. Everyone very friendly and professional.  Love the pizza!"}
{"text":"Born in Manhattan, lived in SF for the last 40 years, traveled to Italy quite a bit the food at Pomo is excellent.  My wife loves everything, especially the pizza to her it is the closest to what we have find in Italy."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Food okay. We sat for 15 minutes until I found a manager and asked for a server. No apologies, no table touch to see how we were. Our server was nice but too little too late."}
{"text":"I was all pumped up to have a highly rated pizza at Pomo. Rated 98 on yelp. Forget about it! Ordered Pizza land it was burnt with no taste, no cheese, watery sause, very sparse pepperoini. Frankly, Domino's or Pizza Hut would have beat this junk. This pizza was a joke. Don't believe everything you read on yelp. My mom said, Somebody got bribed at Yelp. All I can say is \"never again\". Keep in mind, I am from Chicago, so i do know good pizza pies!"}
{"text":"So delicious! All of their ingredients are imported from Italy. I'll definitely be back. Service was also amazing."}
{"text":"Came in yesterday and dined at the fire place seating. Was very cozy. The food and drinks were great! The service was also very good. My only complaint was around 430 you could see the waitstaff was having a meeting outside. You could hear what I think was the manager screaming and swearing at the staff. I found that very unprofessional. I will be back because of the food and staff but I hope next time I can enjoy my evening instead of being interrupted by foul language and yelling."}
{"text":"Very cute , classy place to have a great pizza with a glass of wine, organic salads and panini"}
{"text":"Best Italian food if you want very authentic pasta or Pizza in a very informal and open space. Service is great too."}
{"text":"Great pizza and foccacia sandwiches. Forno Fabbri is a more casual market while Pomo is slightly nicer with a sit down menu experience. Such great food, but I hate to say that the service and workers are generally unfriendly."}
{"text":"The best pizzeria in Scottsdale! Very good quality and super kind owner!"}
{"text":"We love POMO, this our favorite spot with my family , we go there as much as we can and enjoy it each time, The service is excellent, the atmosphere  is wonderful.  The best  Neopolitana pizza in Scottsdale   Congratulations."}
{"text":"When we arrived on Thursday evening, the restaurant was quite full so we sat at the bar where there were 2 seats right next to the outside section.  I'm so happy we opted for the bar as we had the most pleasant bartender, Noah.  He was very helpful with our wine selection. We weren't sure what we wanted.  After asking our likes and dislikes, he offered a tasting of 3 different types.  We selected the Montepulciano which was perfect.  We had decided to split a salad and a pizza.  Again, not sure which ones we would like, Noah gave us very good descriptions of each and we chose the Bufala pizza.  It turned out to be a perfect night with great food and wine, and a perfect service."}
{"text":"We are having a great night at Pomo! Service is great & so is the food! The patio is the perfect place to eat in fall in Arizona!"}
{"text":"The first 5 minutes of our experience deserves 1 star. If it wasn't for being very hungry and not wanting to look for a restaurant without a wait we would have left. Most of the staff (including the manager) made us feel like we were inconveniencing them. Fortunately though, everything changed when our server Ben came by to greet us. He is so friendly (and from a fellow server very good at what he does) he made us feel like our money was well spent. Even though he was very busy he took the time to go over the wine list with us and gave us a wonderful recommendation! The food here is great and truly exceeded our expectations for pizza and bruschetta. We have been here a few times before and our servers have been good but Ben makes you want to take time out of your night to acknowledge your experience. Thank you Ben!"}
{"text":"Good Pizza.  My wife ordered one of the pasta dishes which was just meh.  She should've ordered the pizza.  Place is a little pricey (considering it is pizza) but overall worth the visit.  I ordered the traditional basil + glass of wine.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Yum! The meatballs are amazing. Staff is great with true Italian spirit. Pizza Oven is so pretty...almost as pretty as my food belly from eating the whole entire pizza! Great atmosphere & bar. My go to for when we don't know where we want to go for dinner."}
{"text":"When I crave good pizza... Pomo is the only place on my mind.. Always. The char on the pizza is to die for - not to mention all the ingredients used in all their dishes is straight from Naples. The owner, Stephano is a great guy. He is funny, pops around all over the Resturant makes sure quality is always on point. Highly highly recommended as a Resturant and also for a quick bite at the counter!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Meatballs were FABULOUS! Staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place. Ever.   The best part about their pizza, in my opinion, is the sourdough crust which is not only delicious, but also healthier for you (because it's sourdough it's easier to digest). As a family who abstains from gluten, except when offered true sourdough bread, or in this case, a pizza with sourdough crust, we enjoy it.   In fact, we learned about this place from a friend who raved about the sauce on the pizza and their gluten-free (not the sourdough) pizza option as she's celiac. Once I went online and saw they offered a sourdough pizza crust I knew I had to go that route. And? It's SOOOO GOOD!  I'm also impressed at Pomo's diligence in sourcing quality ingredients from Italy. We've had the pizza a few times as I can't seem to part with it, but I'm intrigued that they have wild-caught salmon in a dish on the menu and organic salads. And, in spite of not eating gluten unless as noted above, I probably have to sink my teeth into a cannoli one of these days.  The prices are perfectly reasonable, the decor is cool, and the service has (every time!) been top notch. They are attentive from the time we enter through to the time we leave. I highly recommend this place, and my family looks forward to it being our regular (i.e., only) pizza joint we frequent."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is great...can get a little crowded in the bar and patio area.  First - the mozzarella is some of the freshest in town.  I forgot to ask if they make it themselves but it's bomb  Second - the drinks are quick and do the job every time  I love that we have such a solid place in the neighborhood for my pizza fix"}
{"text":"I was in for dinner yesterday-Sat. night.  I have a gluten allergy, so I was excited that a restaurant that prides itself on pizza offered a gluten free version.  It is difficult to find fair much less good gluten free pizza.  Alas, I was disappointed as the margherita pizza was nearly inedible.  The crust was ok, so perhaps these pizzas need to cooked a little longer than their standard pizzas. Even the restaurant could not cut it into slices since they were all partially attached.  If you can't offer a better meal than this, then don't.  Unfortunately, other than salads and appetizers , there is not much else for those of us who need gluten free to eat.  So the gluten free option is really not available.  Everyone else in our party seemed to be pleased except for my wife who told me never to ask her to share a gluten free pizza with her again."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on the recommendation of a local resident of the Scottsdale area.  We were very impressed with our experience.  We had a reservation at 5:30 pm and it was nice to get there before the place filled up and got really busy.  We had the caprese to start - one of the best I've had. My husband and I shared the lasagne al forno (again - one of the best I've ever had) and the bufala verace pizza. The pizza was good but I would try a different one next time we go.  We finished it off with a chocolate mousse (OMG!).  The food was amazing and our waiter gave us exceptional service. The atmosphere is simple but very appealing and modern. I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants an authentic Italian meal!"}
{"text":"I move with my family from Uruguay here in Arizona  My first time in this place and my family and I had a great experience, I find funny that my 10 years old daughter tell me how much like the our waiter because call her beautiful, the pizza was good and original like the our  Italian waiter that start to tell us the amazing adventure he had around the globe, we'll be back for sure great job."}
{"text":"I love the bar at POMO. Great selection, the food is consistently good, the bartenders are exceptional (especially Reann) and the ambience is hard to top. I highly recommend POMO in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I had never been to Pomo before this visit.  I was in Gainey Village and decided to go to Pomo because the design of the restaurant was amazing and when I walked inside the decor was just beautiful.  Unfortunately that did not carry over into the service or the food.  It was not busy and I don't know why it would take a long time to have drinks refilled.  The salad was just mediocre and I dont understand why when you order a pasta dish it wouldn't come with some sort of bread.  I mean this is an Italian restaurant.  Our waiter was polite but not very attentive and I just don't see why with so many other wonderful places to eat that I would come back."}
{"text":"Steer clear of this place. Poor staff service at the front desk as they don't seem to know what is going on within their own establishment. Wont be back. Staffers seem to seat people at random without using the system and causing confusion."}
{"text":"Amber was our server. She was very nice and very informed about the different items on the menu. The mushroom soup is out of this world. The toto pizza is going to be my favorite item."}
{"text":"This is one of the only authentic Italian restaurants in the valley. I have been here countless times and continue to enjoy it. The porcini pizza, eggplant parmigiana, strozzapreti alla salsiccia (pasta), and tagliatelle alla bolognese are some of my favorites. The service is also amazing. I recommend this to anyone hungry for Italian food."}
{"text":"Another memory-bank evening dinner with family tonight! Pomo's home-like setting, top-notch service, and authenticity are perfect ingredients for a 5-star experience! I am from Chicago and this pizza is hands-down THE best!!! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu & the staff is far more than customer-service oriented. Our server this evening, Marie, made us feel like family... She made great recommendations, was vastly knowledgeable about the menu/wine, and went above & beyond all expectations!!! We could have stayed all night just to continue conversation... We love you, Marie and thank you for such a lovely Sunday!!! A big bow of gratitude to you all at Pomo:)) LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great patio and atmosphere, turns out it is locally owned which makes it even better. Thin  crust pizza with a fresh sweet sauce, like nothing else in town...the kids love it!"}
{"text":"Shout out to the awesome Stefano for always given us extra care and attention and making us such sweet pies tonite! This place is our eternal go to and he's made PRG group into a wonderful brand here in the desert.  And yes we will take you to Tsukiji for sushi for sure one day! Thx for taking the time out to make us a special dessert yourself!! Arigato"}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor of the original (or former) Pomo at the Borgata, I was thrilled to see this one open closer to my home.  First visit was on the first week of opening, and as expected, dicey service but wonderful pizza.  On our second visit, service actually seemed worse!  No kidding...... Forgot our wine order, served wrong pizza and this on top of a 20 minute wait for a table, when there were nothing but open tables!!  Third visit (yes, I kept trying), seems like a whole new staff but same service.  Trainees are hardly given a chance, and a whole new crop seems to pop up without anything improving.  Overall, I'd say, bring lots of patience & your appetite because both will be tested.  Too bad management doesn't know how to manage.  Patience, persistence & positiveness breeds top notch servers and employees."}
{"text":"OMG!  Best pizza and the mango salad is to die for.  The service is exemplary. My favorite servers are Landon, Danny, and Amber; I'm certain that all of the servers are of the same caliber but these are the only servers I've had.    Now that I've discovered Pomo I will return frequently. It's a little way from my house and there are several Italian/pizza restaurants much closer but they are not quite as good. I will happily continue to go the extra couple of miles to dine at Pomo."}
{"text":"Well, just what I expected - we had a wonderful meal / event.  The service was great and the pies were even better than the last visit. There is no reason not to go and enjoy an evening here.  You will be very, very pleased.  My daughter wants to make this a weekly event Thank you"}
{"text":"Our experience at Pomo was wonderful! It was my first time trying the restaurant and we were not disappointed, not only was the restaurant decor beautiful but the food and service was excellent. Our server was Marie and she took great care of us, we can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Be sure to make a reservation. Pizza is great, closest to Napoli in AZ."}
{"text":"We had hoped to go to Pomo before the Scottsdale Train Park, so I called the restaurant and asked if we would have a problem getting a seat around 5:45. The hostess said they don't get busy until 7 and that we should have no problem getting a table for two adults and one child. We arrived right at 5:45 and were told that the only tables that were available were outside. (It was 55 degrees outside at the time and we have a toddler with us) I was pissed, but we went with it. We ordered all of our food at once and after 20 minutes of nothing but drinks, I asked for some bread. Keep in mind that I now have a hungry and cold toddler to deal with. The busser told me that bread was a menu item and that I had to order it from the server. Really? Ok... now I was really pissed. The salad was mediocre at best (greens, cucumbers and some unripe tomatoes). Despite the fact that the pizzas were \"certified\" as being authentic Napoleon pizzas, they were way over rated IMHO. Service became very slow towards the end of our visit. So slow that I had to get up and find a staff member to ask our server for a box and a check. To add insult to injury, two 12 inch pizzas, a craptastic salad and two glasses of wine were $72.00. Grimaldi's and Pizzaria Bianco are a thousand times better than this place. My recommendation... don't waste your money or your time on Pomo."}
{"text":"Stefano...we love Pomo...you have all the pieces in place...love the place, the food, Antonio...espresso is \"eccezionale\"...except your front line Hosts...and phone Hosts...please make sure that they perform and are up to the task...they are not informed...not accommodating and they are arguing with customers...veramente...???...!!!...that is the last thing you want...\"credimi\"...un appassionato...!!!"}
{"text":"I am both Italian and a fervent traveler of Italy, and this is the most authentic Italian restaurant I have been to in Scottsdale! Their pizza crusts, along with their authentic buffalo mozzarella are by far the best aspects of their food. The menu items are more than reasonably priced. They bake the pizzas on volcanic ash in an authentic oven. They environment and staff are enjoyable. I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very nice family dinner at Pomo. Accommodated 3 kids and 3 adults very quickly. Pizza was delicious, salads were great. The bar was the only downside - sent us the wrong wine and the drink that we ordered was terrible."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian pizza! The pizza is fantastic, the service very attentive and helpful and the desserts were amazing! Definitely recommend the semifreddo."}
{"text":"20 dollars for a small pizza that tastes like burnt crust? No thank you. God I miss real NY pizza."}
{"text":"Had Pizza & drinks at the bar !!! Food quality was fresh & delicious and service from our bartender Tracy was outstanding !!! Also great wine choices will be back !!!"}
{"text":"I love Pomo and the food but after our experience this afternoon I shall never return. We came in after 1:30 for a late lunch. Asked for a patio table and was told all were reserved for a large party. When i looked there were table scattered everywhere including a two top by itself against the wall. When a asked the already snooty hostess she said 'I told they are all reserved!' Her attitude and unwillingness to suggest a solution killed my desire to even eat there and I shall never do so again."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of Neapolitan pizza (and I am!) this place is a dream come true.  The crust is perfect, it's thin/crispy/chewy all at the same time with the dark patches that absorb the wood smoke from the oven.  Toppings are balanced, not too much of anything that overwhelms the other ingredients.  I've tried the Amatricana - it was very good, the Margherita - it was excellent, Quattro Formaggi - ridicuously delicious.  The Emilia Focaccia is like their pizza, not what I expected but they warn you when you order and we loved it.  We've also tried the appetizer with the cured meat assortment, I only ate the cheese and bread but my husband assured me the meats were top quality and delicious.  The Mozzarella di Bufala appetizer is delicious too.  Gnocchi is clearly homemade and fresh, on the rare occasion I don't want pizza this will be my go to meal here.  My husband goes crazy for the pasta & fagioli, he orders a second portion just to take home and freeze  It's a nice mall complex with tons of parking and lots of other shops.  Small restaurant with all tables (one row has a long booth seat that faces a table and chairs).  They have an Italian market and mozzarella bar attached to the restaurant - haven't eaten anything from that side yet but the menu looks outrageous."}
{"text":"We have been going to Pomo since they were originally at the Borgata in scottsdale.  The \"new\" Pomo at Gainey village is beautiful! The pizza is outstanding!  We have been all over italy  many times and the pizza at Pomo is exactly what  it tastes like in italy .! It is real & \"AUTHENTIC .  It is not AMERICAN pizza but ITALIAN pizza.  The best part of Pomo is the owner Stefano!!  Friendly, warm & best part ...loud & enthusiastic.  The patio has a great vibe ! My husband Eddie & I love this place!  It reminds us of our trips to italy"}
{"text":"I have given this place a couple chances now, and both times the food was very mediocre. The pizza was ok, and the lasagna was mostly pasta and missing actual flavor. The one thing I do like is the ambiance. Great little bar, nice patio, good service, but the food just isn't something to rave about which is too bad. Just so you have a comparison, the pizza places I like in town is Slice of Sicily, Pizzaria Bianco, and Crust."}
{"text":"Great tortallini, service and atmosphere.  Great for singles to sit at bar and have dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to Pomo for several company outings and for dinner dates. The quality of service and food never wavers whether I'm there with two people or twenty - it is always an excellent visit with knowledgable waiters and delicious pizzas. Any of the pizzas they offer on the menu are absolutely delicious as well, I wouldn't hesitate trying a new option here at all. Definitely worth a visit, don't miss the patio in cooler weather!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked at the reviews with 4 & 5 stars. Our family was celebrating my nephew's graduation today. We ordered 4 different pizzas, 2 calzones, side of meatballs, and a few other things. The food was tasteless. I have to laugh, the waiter told us Pomo's served a truly authentic Neapolitan Pizza. I have never had tasteless authentic Neapolitan Pizza until today. Thank goodness there was red pepper and Parmesan cheese on the table and we were all starving, Just drive on by and save your money."}
{"text":"Edit: came in randomly, great staff, took care of us.   Best gluten free dairy free pizza in Arizona. No lie. Absolutely great."}
{"text":"We came with friends and were treated like family. Frankie was a terrific waitress. The menu offered many enticing dishes. I had the Eggplant Parmesan as an entree and it was perfect- no breading. Salads were fresh and my husband's pizza tasted just like one we shared in Sorrento, Italy.  Don't miss the gelato!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Italian restaurant. I went to the Phoenix location when it first opened and tried out the second location in Scottsdale. I was impressed that stove pieces where brought over from Naples. That is a region where many of my ancestors where from in Italy. The pasta and other ingredients are fresh and the service is top notch. Everyone in the valley should try this place out."}
{"text":"The prices have slowly increased and the portions have shrunk. The pizza has become smaller and the dough is tougher. Addition of a la cartel items that were once part of entree.  Wait staff still superb a plethora of management  stands around watching activity.  Pizza quality has decreased. Grimaldi's has better venue and quality"}
{"text":"This is really authentic Neapolitan pizza. I lived in Naples for a few months in the 90s. This brought back memories. The pizza was great, they also have a wood-fired oven which is important. Extensive wine list and attentive service.They also have panna cotta which is not as easy to find as a dessert in other Italian restaurants"}
{"text":"Fresh Italian food! Beyond amazing for pizza and the Italian atmosphere! This is now our favorite pizza we have ever had, and we're huge pizza criti. All food is imported fresh from Italy, even something simple like tomatoes. They even make their pasta fresh every day. This restaurant also has a small store for some of their ItalianAMAZING find!!!!! This owner is doing something right!! This is a must for anyone looking for an priced right, amazingly fresh true Italian experience!! They also have Diet Coke! :)"}
{"text":"Just got home from having the \"promised\" vegan pizza, What a great place, the owner is so attentive to customers. You truly feel welcomed there. I have found the best vegan pizza place EVER!!"}
{"text":"I ordered 2 chicken panini to go.  The chicken was so tough we could not chew it.  This was a very disappointing surprise, as their pizza and pasta are the best in Phoenix! This chicken was way below standards and in edible.  Extremely disappointing and a waste of money."}
{"text":"Went there tonight and ordered the Principe, Bufala and Marguerita pizzas, mulo Siciliano drinks and for dessert, tiramisu and semifreddo. All were delicious!  Luca, our sommelier, was charming and very helpful assisting us with our food selections. New favorite pizza place."}
{"text":"I loved the original location at the Borgata more, but the new spot is substantially larger, with a great covered patio as well.  I had my birthday here again (previously at the Borgata location), and while we were a large group, the service from one of our 2 assigned waitstaff was frenetic.  When trying to find out how we were to be billed, she was essentially complaining and being extremely pushy about how hard it is to split checks and she needed to know NOW!  My pals eventually deferred to me, where I reiterated that we weren't all just going to \"throw credit cards in and split it\".  Gimme a break! I checked before booking to make sure it was still OK to split checks. You're getting your large group guaranteed tip, so chill the f out and stop yelling at my friends at my birthday dinner!  The food was great, and the service otherwise good.  At another recent visit, our service on the patio was pathetic.  With empty drinking glasses, I eventually turned it into self-service and took our empty glasses to be refilled at the bar.  That should NEVER happen. Ever.  Drink tip: their version of the mule is NOT good...ask for a regular Moscow mule or order a different drink!"}
{"text":"I have yet to experience a fantastic pizza place in Scottsdale or Phoenix, although my stepdaughter claims it is definitely Spinato's. Either way, it certainly was not Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana, which was \"average\" in my book.  We arrived at the restaurant on a Tuesday evening for a 7:00 p.m. reservation. We started with a cocktail, and my bellini was pleasant, but nothing out of the ordinary. My husband and I split a Caprese salad as an appetizer, and it neither looked nor tasted any differently than the ones we put together at home. There were four slices of mozzarella, four slices of tomato, and a four large basil leaves spread across the plate. It tasted fine, but again, it was not anything special.  I ordered the porcini pizza, and found it lacked flavor. The porcini was pleasant, the cheese was as you would expect. The crust was not particularly rich or buttery. The pizza itself seemed to need some fresh herbs or spices to lift it a bit - perhaps even porcini powder would have helped bring out some of the mushroom flavor, which was sparse.  The waitstaff was friendly and helpful, so no complaints there."}
{"text":"I crave Pomo pizza on a regular basis and as much as I seem to eat the food I never get sick of it. The new location at Gainey is beautiful in design and space. I'm so glad they are back in Scottsdale, and better than ever."}
{"text":"I do want to update you guys, a little after posting my review I did have the general manager contact me and talk it out. I have to say that I really appreciate her going out of her way for that and we will be giving this place another try."}
{"text":"Tastes are personal and what you grew up with has a heavy influence on what you prefer. I've had pizza from all the 'pizza cities' - New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, New Haven..... My wife and I came to Pomo to taste the pizza that gets rave reviews and many claim superior to Pizzeria Bianco. We started with a Caprese Salad. The Buffalo Mozzarella was moist, excellent consistency, and just the right amount of salt.  The tomato tasted like a hot house or hydroponic variety and the basil  and olive oil lacked serious flavor.  We also shared a Crocchete Pugliesi, an interesting combination of potato, mozzarella, and prosciutto.  The accompanying tomato sauce complemented the appetizer nicely.  Finally, we had a Pomo pizza.  Overall, it's a better than average pizza but not in the same class as Pizzeria Bianco's Wiseguy."}
{"text":"Incredible! I come here for lunch occasionally during the week (Pollo Salad is my favorite) but just came for date night and it topped my expectations. Their gluten free pizza crust is the best I've ever had - anywhere. AND, they have vegan cheese. So, it's the first pizza I've had that felt both gourmet and still light and healthy. Normally gluten free crusts are thin and delicate, but this had the feel of a regular pizza. Highly recommend this place for any meal, any day. Also, try the red pepper olive oil. Great on salad and pizza."}
{"text":"I just returned from the European vacation where I ate several pizzas and pastas in Rome  Pizzeria Pomo is a closest thing I have tasted outside of Europe to authentic Italian food  The tomatoes are imported from Italy their pizzas are perfectly cooked their ingredients are flavorful and fresh and wonderful  I've had nothing but excellent service each time I've gone!  This is really fabulous terrific and delicious food"}
{"text":"Over a year and a half ago, we moved to Scottsdale and my husband took our family to Pomo, bc this is where he sometimes took clients when he was here for business. We ordered our pizzas and some appetizers to share. Once the pizzas came we realized that my daughter and I got charred pizzas. We ate the appetizers and only ate a few uncharred bites of our own pizzas, leaving all the rest on our plates. The waiter finally came and looked at the two full plates and asked how everything was. We told him that two of our pizzas were burnt, to which he said: \"Oh, you should have told me sooner, I would have gotten you two new ones\"! Now, it was latish in the night, but the kitchen wasn't closed and he could have taken the two pizzas back and brought new ones. Needless to say, we never went back. Fast forward to last month. My daughter and I were driving in the area when we saw a sign for an Italian Grocer! I immediately parked and went in to get some Italian goodies to take home. The beautiful young girl behind the register had a Pomo shirt on! I asked her if we had accidentally gone to the side door of Pomo and she said that the grocery store was part of the restaurant! I immediately, but discreetly decided to leave. She was so sweet, that I decided to explain why I was suddenly leaving. I told her why and she said if the owner and manager knew what had happened, they would want to make it right, so she called the manager (Lawson Davis). I was caught off guard as I wasn't expecting to be complaining about something that had happened almost 2 years ago! He walked up and I told him the story. He asked us to have a seat in the dining room and to give Pomo another chance! We decided to stay and a lovely waitress took our order. Before we knew it we were eating pizza perfection like you can only get in southern Italy. the manager was nice enough to come by to check on us and we told him how lovely the pizzas were. He stopped by a little later to ask us what we wanted for desert, but because we hadn't had desert the last time, I told him he would have to charge me for that. Desert was fabulous and when the bill came, he had taken care of it, even the desert!  Mistakes like this happen in the best restaurants, but it's an exceptional staff that can turn a negative experience into a positive and Pomo, not only redeemed itself when it delivered on the food, but equally importantly, the young girl (in the grocery part) and the manager truly made it right and made customers out of sworn ex-customers. We will not only be backas a family, but my husband has already brought clients back and we've recommended Pomo to two sets of new neighbors. Go check this place out if you want authentic, quality, food served by a really great staff."}
{"text":"Me and my wife decided to try Pomo because of the good reviews. The atmosphere was nice and the menu had a wide variety of things I would have liked to try.  We decided to go with the pesto pasta and the tortelloni.  When we received the plates I thought I was on a candid camera show.  I could not believe how little food you get. I have never eaten at a place that gives you so little. It was comical. I will never eat here again unless I want to order a triple plate and spend like $50 for a pasta dinner.  The food was pretty good but there are so many other great pasta restaurants with a satisfying meal at a similar price."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in the valley. It beats Pizzeria Bianco and Cibo, which is hard to do. The pizzas are to die for. The Scottsdale location is nicer than the Phoenix location."}
{"text":"Had six at Pomo for dinner.  Two of the orders were wrong.  No real apology.  They charge $2 for bread!  It's an Italian restaurant.  Seriously?  Waiter was not the best.  Probably won't go back.   Well I went back and I would take a star away now!  Friend ordered pizza.  Myself and another ordered the same salad.  Pizza cake reasonable time and they assured the salads were right behind it.  15 minutes later I called the manager and she apologized and said they would be right out and she would remake the pizza!  She then tried to take the pizza so now only two of us would be eating! Should have comped the whole meal.  She did come the pizza.   Now I really won't go back!!"}
{"text":"This place is the worse version of the one that is in downtown area. I assume the ingredients are all good quality, hoverer they are not properly prepared to make a top notch Napoli style pizza.  Their pizza was rather saggy than crispy, nothing special that I would want to come back and pay $16.  I left disappointed without intention to come back.  If you want to enjoy the quality of well-made Napoli style pizza, you should try Pomo in downtown."}
{"text":"After a long 6 hour flight delay and starving for 12 hours, we sat down and grabbed pizza here. AMAZING!!!   Suffering through Indiana pizza, NY native, this place has great pizzas I got the margherita and my hubs got a meat pizza. Everything from sauce to cheese to bread was great. Thin crust with fresh ingredients. You can't beat it.   The fresh ingredients are excellent. I ate cold leftover slices later that night and in the morning. And still tastes good. A few days later we ordered pick up from here. Eating in the restaurant is definitely better. But the taste is still phenomenal."}
{"text":"Very average pizza with very little sauce. Cute place and ok service with good iced tea!"}
{"text":"It was ok. I've had much better even in phoenix.  Our antipasto platter and Quattro stagioni pizza.  The platter was weak two chunks of parm, one salami, one proscutto and canned veggies.  The pizza was wet. The crust was tasty.  The toppings were just ok.  I had hopes but left disappointed. The Pinot Grigio was buttery and delicious though."}
{"text":"My wife  and I came here on the 4th of July with our best friends and all of had a fantastic time!! Today (lucky for us) everything we ordered was $4! Beer, specialty cocktails, well drinks, and amazing appetizers. All $4 each!! We sat out on the patio and even though it was 105 degrees outside they were able to keep the patio cool and comfortable. We ordered the homemade chips, \"salumi board\", calamari, mini meatballs, and, our unanimous favorite, the \"gamberi Pomo\" which was flippin' delicious!! Shrimp lying in a bed of sauce covered in mozzarella! Holy cow! Never had cheese covered shrimp before today and it's now my favorite way to eat shrimp!! Our server, Zach, provided great service and was very attentive!  Definitely would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Don't normally write reviews, but we are in town for the weekend and decided to try this place out. While the kale salad wasn't anything to write home about. The pasta carbonara and the pizza were great. But it was ben's service that put this place above and beyond for us. Super quick and attentive. One of the best servers I have ever had. Thanks Ben!!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The misto salad was great with real extra virgin oil oil and tasty shaved Parmesan.  The meatballs melted in your mouth but were very full of flavor.  Every ingredient on the pizza was top end and added its own unique flavor.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Second best authentic Neapolitan pizza in the US beside New York. Will definitely go back whenever in town."}
{"text":"I'm from NYC and spent a considerable amount of time in Italy so I have high standards when it comes to pizza. Pomo was great. Service was attentive. Pizza was delicious--we have the Napoli which was delicious. We also had the aranchini which I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Agree with James N.  Meh...Grimaldi's is much better quality pizza.  Small so-so pizza.  I'd doubt any review that says \"This place is amazing!\"  OMG, fer shuuurrr!"}
{"text":"I went for the house made pasta. It was decent. The pizza was mediocre. The caprese salad tomatoes were unripe.  There is no shortage of pizza restaurants in the area, so it had better be good, and this was nothing special.   The place was packed yet service was swift. The waitstaff were good and professional. But food not the best. Maybe the other diners were first-timers like us. I cannot imagine wanting to try it a second time."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food, great service, definitely coming back for more. We loved the gnocchi and loved the pizza even more."}
{"text":"Our server, Amy I think? She was awesome... Dust storm came through while we were on the patio and she moved us to a vacant reserved table so we could finish dinner.  The pizza was AWESOME. A little on the pricey side, but what do you expect at Gainey Ranch? We definitely want to come back. The inside was VERY cool and casual. Great place to just hang out with friends."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST PIZZA  West of Italy. And the service is second to none! Kudos to Cricket!! She's an angel."}
{"text":"I came here for a early Mother's Day dinner with my family because of:  A) The ratings and B) We were craving delicious, wood-fired pizza...Here's why I was let down and I think POMO could improve upon:   -The server wasn't enthusiastic, he seemed bored and disinterested.    -The pizza literally took FOREVER...probably 1 hour and without any communication from the server to let us know it was coming, or when we could expect it to arrive.  Luckily we did have a few appetizers to tide us over (Bread is $2 FYI and they don't carry pesto?)  - What we ordered: Kale salad (waste of money and not good) , Bruschetta (actually tasty), wood-fired pizza (soggy crust, did not impress me at all..didn't even taste wood-fired) Spaghetti Bolognese (My Dad sent it back, it tasted like hamburger helper)   The food quality is very mediocre for the price you pay.  Go to Grimaldi's or Oreganos and save your money."}
{"text":"Wanted to see what all the hype was about and all the great reviews (although lately some have been low).  Ordered the PRINCIPE for take out.  Waited 25 minutes which is not too bad for a Saturday night.   Principe came with sauce, mozzarella, proscuitto, topped with arugula and bits of basil.  It had some charred on the edges which is a result of the wood fired oven.  It was a good pizza but $18 for a 12 inch pizza is a bit much in retrospect.  The place has a nice buzz to it and people were dressed to the nines just to go to a pizzeria---that's Scottsdale for you."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review.  Hands down my favorite pizza place in the Valley.  In fact, I went to both this location in Gainey and the downtown one this past weekend.  Both were stellar in every sense.  The pizza, salads. service, etc.  Can't recommend this place enough.  Stop reading this and go make a reservation!!"}
{"text":"Terrific experience! These guys were slammed and took not only our party of eight... But created a separate table for the kids and made them feel extra special. We had a wonderful time in the food and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Tuesday at 430 and was turned away because they were \"fully committed.\" There was literally only one couple eating in the dining room. I find it a bit ridiculous that they couldn't seat us when our dinner would've taken no more than an hour. The hostess was very unapologetic because apparently this is the norm. I've eaten here before without a reservation so I was surprised. Sure, it's a nice place, but this experience has turned me off so I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic. There's not one thing here that was bad. In fact everything we got was mind blowing, from appetizers to pizza and pasta to desert.   We ordered a ton of appetizers, the most interesting was the focaccia which was unique. It's basically a thin thin crust pizza like a tortilla with very thin cheese. The waitress poured hot honey over. It was delicious. It was unlike anything I had before. I highly recommend it.    The boffola mozzarella was also incredible. Fresh fresh fresh. I can't emphasize that enough. Perfectly hand rolled to be chewy yet soft. The sauce wasn't overpowering either. We also got calamari, bruschetta and some thinly sliced meats. My pizza was incredible and my pana cotta desert was perfect.    I've had my fair share of Italian and I highly recommend this place. It is possibly one of the best I've had for fresh homemade style Italian food. Please make it a priority to visit this place."}
{"text":"Sat on patio. Food was ok. Was a little disappointed thought it would be more authentic Italian   Caprese lacked balsamic and was bland.   Waitress was friendly. It was busy and she had a lot of tables. But was very attentive.   The fire bakes pizza was good. But lacked the toppings Of what pizza we got. Very saucy with no toppings.   Bar was busy but bartender was so annoying with his comments and laugh"}
{"text":"Several years ago, I tried Pomo based upon Yelp recommendations and ended up having one of the best pizzas I've had (and I've been to the top places in LA, SF, NYC and here in the Phoenix area -- also Chicago, but that's a whole different category).  I finally was in Phoenix again, and I had to return.  Once, again, one of the best pizzas I've ever had."}
{"text":"Please do something about the sewage smell at your Scottsdale location!  I came back again thinking the really awful smell I experienced  was just a temporary fluke.  Nope!  Even months later, the smell was still there.  No excuse for that.  Who wants to eat when you can smell sewage?  It ruins the dining experience.    Something needs to be fixed.  The food was excellent, but the waiters and staff though were a bit rude."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the fact that they had vegan options at an Italian restaurant! I really wish I saw that kind of thing more often. There were plenty of different types of dishes marked as vegan so you have a lot of variety to choose from! I decided to get the Vegan Pizza that came with topped with tomato sauce, daiya cheese, basil and extra virgin olive oil. It was so delicious and I couldn't believe how soft and yummy the crust tasted! Definitely recommend this place if you're ever in the area, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Has an area where you can purchase Italian food items and gelato. I started off with a mulo drink and fritto misto. The drink was very refreshing I had two. Fritto misto came with a nice portion of shrimp and squid as well as a dipping sauce. I had the Lasagna al Forno. Good portion, very creamy and rich just as the other dishes I tried which included the Strozzapreti Salsiccia and the Spacattelle Carbonara. Lasagna was the best hands down. We ended with the Torta de Nutella. Ordered that because we were told it was sooo good and you were able to pour the ganache over it. Well the cake tasted of refrigerator, not creamy and flourless. Our server said it is not made flourless anymore but the description in the menu was never changed. The chocolate fountain was broken so we didn't have any ganache. Yes it was disappointing because we were looking forward to that. The waiter stated he'd tried telling management to change that but they never listen, his exact words btw. I personally would have never mentioned that last part to a customer but hey he was honest. The food was good overall. I liked it."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best - if not, the best - pizza in the Valley. The service is always polite. One problem, the service is very slow. Whether it's a busy hour, or a quiet time, for some reason it takes a long time to get a server to come to the table, have them bring you a drink, and then deliver the check. I think the quality servers are overworked and under staffed. We'll go back for the great pizza! But we'll have to factor in some extra time. PS: Great music, my wife loves the music."}
{"text":"Returned in February 2015.  Great Neapolitan-type pizza (thin moist crust).  Small but nice beer selection, great selection of Italian wine.  Classic bruschetta app really nice, if a bit difficult to eat.  Nice selection of pizzas.  Standard house salad terrific, and will feed a table of 4-6! Rice ball app good but not great.  Pasta with sausage outstanding.  Great outdoor seating area."}
{"text":"I found Pomo on Yelp and decided to make the 30 minute trip due to a number of positive reviews. In complete honesty, I thought my overall experience was just...okay.   PROS:  -Indoor ambiance: modern with a European twist, open, clean, and cute  -Service: knowledgeable and friendly   CONS: -Outdoor ambiance: we sat outside and felt like we were sitting in the parking lot, tight space -Food: we ordered calamari as an appetizer which was quite good. For our entrees, we ordered the 4 cheese pizza and a margarita pizza. Both were mediocre--I could barely taste the 4 cheeses in the pizza, they were bland, and soggy.  -Price: high for the quality"}
{"text":"This is a really nice pizza place in Scottsdale that is also attached to Forno Fabbri (a market and bar area). The ambiance is relaxed, casual, contemporary. There's a shaded outdoor patio (a little too cold at the moment), as well as indoor seating. The service is friendly, and the food is delicious.  We shared the POMO pizza (comes with sausage, mushroom, bellpeppers, and onions), the lasagna, and the Capri panini (with Italian sausage, sauteed mushrooms, roasted red bell peppers, sauteed onions, & evoo). The pizza and panini were very good, with quality bread/crust and very fresh-tasting ingredients. I didn't really like the lasagna that much - a little too rich and creamy, and the pasta felt soft and a little overcooked.  Definitely a solid experience though."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic!! I have been here on multiple occasions and have never been let down. Staff is friendly, and multiple courses are delivered to our table at just the right time. Ingredients in pizza are fresh, and my food is always hot. The server recommended a good bottle of wine in our price range which we enjoyed. Authentic Italian cuisine! I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Great pizza and the staff is always friendly. A neighborhood gem for sure"}
{"text":"Overall I would say it is slightly above average. The pizza is kinda wet on the inner half.  They claim this is how it is in Naples, but this ain't Naples! I don't want slimy pizza. The service can at times be good, at other times aloof."}
{"text":"Pomo as always, has risen to the occasion. Tonight we had a birthday celebration and our server Alex and the manager Shelly, were outstanding. The service and friendliness from the moment we sat down to the time we left, was amazing. The food was delicious as ever and they were gracious enough to help serve the cake we had made and brought. Everything was perfect. Thank you Pomo for being one of our all time favorite places that we will always come back to."}
{"text":"From out of town.  Drove by POMO and decided to stop for lunch.  That may be one the best decisions I've made this whole trip!  This is really authentic Italian.  We sat outside on the shaded patio and had two of their specialty paninis.  OMG.  I've died and gone to heaven.  Our waiter, Scott, was great, made great recommendations and was very attentive.  Bottom line:  great place.  Well deserving of these 5 stars!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Arizona! Great food, service, and atmosphere. Love the margarita pizza and the romana salad, the pastas are also really tasty ( tagatelle, and carbonara)"}
{"text":"Soooooooo good! I'm in for a visit and was told that I would love this Pizza! Well, I did. Paper thin crust with a wonderful, tangy gravy worthy of my grandmother! I sat at the bar and had a geat time chatting with the equally awesome staff. Thanks for a tasty meal and a great conversation.   Cheers-  John"}
{"text":"Everytime we're in the area we make a couple stops at Pomo's pizzeria for the Arancini and some pizza or chicken sandwhich. Nothing like it! It's also not heavy so no carb crash afterwards."}
{"text":"Went to Pomo two more times since I wrote the review. mad a whole they seem to be doing a better job with quality customer service. The staff has been far more accommodating and more attentive to customers. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here multiple times and I have been satisfied with with everything we have ordered until today a minor issue with the doneness of our pies.  They corrected it promptly and made it perfect  and even threw in a surprise at check out.  Wife had the margherita pizza and I had the Quattro stagioni.  It means four seasons, each section of the pie are different"}
{"text":"It's so good I had to eat three pizzas then I did not eat for three days. However the French food was not good."}
{"text":"Loved our lunch at Pomo Pizzeria. Started with the Forno bread & olives and Mango salad. I can't recall the name of the pizza we ordered but attached a photo. It was excellent. Looking forward to returning."}
{"text":"So sad to say... This place is simply just OK now. No passion for great food as when it first opened. If you don't believe me, just come over on a Friday night, the folks that used to wait an hour for their delicious pies are all gone. Walk right in and be seated... It's true and the reason is because the food and those that make it don't care anymore. Really disappointing, but hey, plenty of other great choices. So just take my word... Don't waste your money on this now \"meh\" experience."}
{"text":"First, start every meal with the meatballs. Share a mixed salad and a bottle of chianti. Get a pizza. You must get a pizza, any one, all excellent. It's all about the experience."}
{"text":"This was the second time at POMA.  First time was decent BUT the bottom of the Pizza was SOGGY.  Second time for a large birthday party spent $250++.  Pizza's were bland and burnt on the bottom.  Pasta was ok but the veges needed to be seen through a microscope.  The meat plate was OK but far frome exciting. The cream sauce was very bland. Tiramasu was very good.  The child's pizza was bad and they would not take it off the bill.  Also billing errors needed to be fixed.  All in all Id rather go to Grazie ( better wine list), Il Bosco, of course Federal Pizza (awesome but its a Postino restaurant) and Grimaldis and the  Parlor."}
{"text":"I heard from some Northern Italian friends that Pomo was an authentic Italian place.  They get the additional star for the Tira Misu which was awesome. Otherwise, it was a one star experience.  The pizza was so so.  The sausage wasn't tasty at all.  And the service....they got overwhelmed, which is understandable, but they did not handle it well.  The key to a good restaurant is how you deal with the problems.    I see all the good reviews here and I would try them again. I even hesitate to post this bad one, but I was so looking forward to a fantastic experience and it truly wasn't."}
{"text":"Ok, where did these real Italians come from here in Scottsdale? Does the owner import Italians and food direct from the mother country. Our waiter either was fresh off the boat or was a great actor with his accent telling us \"Bonappetit\" Too bad the guy cooking pizza was a local guy with tats, so maybe the tatted up Scottsdale guy should switch places with the accented waiter and we might have had a better pizza and meal. This place is open until 11pm, so that is why we ended up here for a late dinner.    Started off with an unusual version of \"rice Balls\" They use saffron rice in the Arrancita and charge about 10 bucks for two balls. A bit too greasy and they fell apart too easy and lacked much flavor, but the accompanying sauce helped a tad. The pepino pizza was a fancy wood oven mess. This is where the real Italian might have helped, but I think all of this place's pizza's come out undercooked on the bottom and mostly cooked on the surface. The crust was soft and edible, but the rest of the pie really came straight out of Compton, not Italy. Arriverderchi Pomo."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place had such good reviews. The atmosphere is great-very nice and trendy, but the food did not match. Very bland, lacked flavor completely. We got three different dishes: pasta fagioli , Bolognese and just plain marinara and penne. All of them were bad. I would have sent it back but we did takeout!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I are getting married the weekend of 11/7/15 and we were recently trying to find a rehearsal dinner location. The hostess did not seem to want our business, she was condescending and rude. I am hoping that they aren't like that toward all of their guests but found it to be unacceptable even if we weren't dressed in appropriate Scottsdale attire as it was a Sunday. They did not seem to want our business, which is too bad for them. Poor customer service and bad attitude. Everyone deserves to be treated kindly and with respect regardless! I'm happy to say we will be going right down the road to a restaurant that actually wanted our business, so I guess I have to thank Pomo for being rude!! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal service and food. The gluten free pasta, which is difficult to cook, was prepared perfectly. Cannot recommend high enough. Great spot for great Italian food up and down the menu. Authentic"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had outside Italy, & I mean southern Italy (Naples) because pizza in Rome was no where near as good as Naples.  100% authentic, I'm so happy I found this place. I always get the buffala mozzarella pizza...so simple yet tasty!"}
{"text":"I am a native of Napoli, Italy and you can trust me on this pizzeria! Complimenti!  As we say in Naples, is a \"Vera Pizza Napoletana\"!  We really enjoyed the pizza, espresso, and gelato... true to Napolitan standards."}
{"text":"Great pizza, service and desserts! Probably the best tiramisu I've had in Arizona... We went there 3 times the month we discovered the place and each time, I ordered the tiramisu. I'll have to try something else next time. The arancini is yummy too! No complaints."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Pomo,  the food was great and the service was excellent. My server was Gina. Gina was very helpful in making my choices and explaining the choices in the menu, very friendly and service with a smile. I would recommend this place for great food and great service."}
{"text":"I love their pizza beyond belief!  My favorite is the Marinara and I add porcini. But the Buffalo Mozza Pizza is also excellent!  Truly all the food is so good! My daughter lives their kids pasta bolognese. Service is always polite and attentive. Could eat here everyday!"}
{"text":"I think this place deserves a solid three stars, although there is plenty of room to move up a bit.  First, let me start by saying that I'm originally from NY, and love/need/thrive on good pizza.   The drinks and house wine is pretty decent for happy hour. I forget the price but I had the house Chianti, mostly always a decent choice when at an italian joint, in my opinion.  I started with the HH meatballs, large in size, i really really liked the sauce.  Very good sauce. The meatballs themselves were pretty average tasting.  True italian meatballs have a blend of veal, pork, and beef.  I get frustrated when restuarunts skip the veal or go cheap on it-- its obvious and annoying.    I ordered the personal margarita pizza, and was pleasantly surprised.  However, its a pretty easy dish and should be considered a no-brainer.   With all the other offerings around Scottsdale, I'm just in no hurry to go back.  I was provided perfect service, great ambience and decent food at a reasonable price.  If Pomo can kick up its food game, then this place will be 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have a weakness for Neapolitan-style pizza, and Pomo had this gal in the palm of its strong, Italian hands.   First off, this is a great restaurant options for large parties or even a first date. There are plenty of tables, a high ceilings, soft light - you'll never feel cramped yet it still keeps an intimate feel.  You can't go wrong with any of the pizzas - that high-flying dough is perfection and any variety of 'za will please the table. We went traditional with Regina Margherita and another, Bufala Verace. Mmmm. Gustoso!   Other table favorites were the meatballs, Crocchete Pulgliesi (potato croquettes), the wine - lots and lots of wine - and the owner! Owner Stefano Fabbri was an incredibly welcoming host - Italian through and through - who insisted we have more wine, food, dessert ... lots of character there.   Next visit to Scottsdale or Pheonix, I'll have to get another Pomo fix."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. We were sat immediately at the bar and even though it was busy our food only took maybe 15 minutes to come to us! I've been to Italy so I can say that the pizza at Pomo is exactly like the pizza I had there! So phenomenal! Wonderful date spot with a full bar and great atmosphere! Will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is decently good.... when we finally got it. It took nearly two hours to get our pasta and pizza, and our waitress would disappear for 45 min at a time. So even if we wanted to ask what's taking so long (or- what I really wanted to do, and just pay her for our food and leave), we couldn't. I expect a Saturday night during spring training to be busy, but that was just downright ridiculous. We were at our table for three hours, and she came back to fill our drinks... once? Maybe twice? Even once we paid, it took 20 minutes to get our cards back. As for the food, we had a pretty broad spread between everyone and I was able to try a few things. I'd say it's middle of the road Italian food (which I was surprised by because the owner is actually Italian, and it came very highly recommended). Maybe I'll be back for lunch when it's not busy, but probably not."}
{"text":"Arrived for dinner with my family around 7pm, greeted by 3 girls at the hostess desk that seemed to be caught off guard asking for a table. They said that they could only seat us outside or we could move next door to the other restaurant that served the same menu. We chose the other restaurant which is advertised as the \"Mozzarella bar.\" My wife, daughter and I proceed to head out the door only to wonder around trying to look for this \"mozzarella bar\". We then realize that it is housed in the same restaurant, just blocked off by a partition. The 3 girls really did a poor job of directing us just 10 feet to the other area. All 3 watched us walk out the front door. After the confusion we where seated in an area that seemed to be more of a casual area. We where greeted by a waiter who seemed to be in slow mode & put out the entire time he had to serve us. We were is only table. He mentioned several times that he typically worked the other room and was a little unfamiliar with the menu. This made me think he was in the \"time out room\" and being punished for the poor service maybe he provide 10 feet away on the other side. Now this is just my speculation. Ordered from the mozzarella menu. $10 for a large ball of what seemed like homemade mozzarella. Now mind you he did not even explain the menu at all or how items are prepared. Nothing to sell the restaurant or what they are known for. Entire meal service was poor at best. He stood the entire time behind the counter and kept playing with the high end meat slicer turning the wheel. Other waiters seemed to be hurrying around to provide top notch service. Dinner arrived and we ordered 2 pizza's and one pasta dish. The food is pretty good here. Pizza served individual size really is plenty for 2 people to share. Again it would have been nice had our waiter told us that. My daughter and wife both packed each of their pizza up as they could only finish half at most. My bowl of tagliatelle  Bolognese was very good bowl of homemade pasta. Well worth the $16 bucks. The food is beyond decent but not knock your socks off. The service for lack of a better word... sucked. I would probably would come back to dine on the other side of the restaurant and see if the service improved. 2 ice teas, 2 apps, 2 pizza and 1 bowl of pasta ran $83. I would say a little on the higher end."}
{"text":"Really good New Age Italian, with a small Cheese and meat market attached for EVO and Balsamic heaven lovers.   Pizza is good, an attempt at the regulated Rome 12 inch round.   The beef lasagna is good and not commercial tasting as most tend to be when bought at a restaurant.  Good wine selection, decent price and a surprisingly great dirty martini.  Good for dates or an Italian fix, a bit pricy as you do 3-4 courses, but worth it."}
{"text":"The food at Pomo was extremely delicious. The melon covered with salami was typical Italian and delicious. The pizza there has a extremely thin crust full of flavor that enlightens the taste buds. The delicious food that they make is one of the best. They make the food with such care and precision and it's all handmade. Everything was good and delicious from the water to the pizza. I will be coming back. It was truly a delight to eat at Pomo."}
{"text":"Pizza is one of my top 3 favorite foods and I love it and eat a lot of it in all its forms - thin crust, thick crust, original crust, stuffed crust, rolled up into stromboli, folded up into a calzone...and Pomo Pizzeria has hands down the best Neapolitan pizza I've had in Arizona. My god everything is spot on fantastic and delicious! I've been many times, and the pizza never disappoints. The crust is perfection - moist, chewy, perfectly crusted on the outside and soft on the inside, slightly smoky/charred from the wood fired oven. The tomato sauce is perfect - bright, flavorful, fresh. The cheese is great, the olive oil is great, the basil is great. And it all culminates into a perfect pizza. My favorite is the Pizza Margherita. My favorite salad at Pomo is the Mango Salad which has lots of fresh arugla, lettuce to balance out the arugula, sharp blue cheese, and some just-ripe mango. The Calzone Napoletano is amazing - it has the wonderful crust and sauce of the pizza, plus more cheese and portions that have a thick crust in addition to the thin crust. It's definitely more filling than the pizza.  I really enjoy the Panna Cotta dessert, which is very light and easy to eat after stuffing yourself silly with good pizza.  Parking is easy and there is a wonderful outdoor patio that seats a good number of people. But sitting inside isn't bad either because of the open kitchen. Friendly and quick service. Absolutely no complaints!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. This place is sensational. The only thing better than the food was the service.  Hint. Have the tiramisu for desert. Crazy good!"}
{"text":"We've been to Pomo on two occasions to eat in and a couple more times for take-out. I've been very impressed with both the food and service. This place has a very nice atmosphere but still caters to people with children. From the host to the waiter, the service is always with a smile. They have crayons and paper menus for the kids and a great kids menu. They get the kids' orders in right away which makes everyone happy. We keep going back because we absolutely love the pizzas. They are so delicious. We've had the salads too which are great, but really the pizzas steal the show. They are the perfect mix of crisp and doughy.  This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"So delicious, we had it for dinner two nights in a row while staying at the nearby Hyatt Regency. Authentic, flavorful and great customer service. Can't wait to return on our next visit to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"The marketplace is very neat. They serve pizza at odd times and they often only have a few slices for sale. It's super pricy, like $5 a slice but the pizza is really delicious."}
{"text":"unbelievable non-existent service. We were shown to our table by the hostess and given menus. The place was 2/3 full. Sat waiting tried to catch attention of waiters - all too busy to look up. So after quite a wait I went to the front desk - hostess and what appeared to be the manager were involved in a conversation that did not involve looking up at customers. Rather than interrupt I decided to see how long they would leave a customer standing there before noticing. They won - after waiting for 2 full minutes with neither one of them lifting their gaze from the table map I said excuse me - the manger raised his finger as if to ask me to wait. I returned to my table, gathered my party and we walked out. again no one looked up.  If there is one thing that drives me crazy it's these places that get all self-important. They think the customer is a necessary interruption to running the place."}
{"text":"I like it... I Definitely LIKE IT!  I will start off by saying for the 2 times we have been so far, great service. Better service the 1st time (I would say GREAT), and good service the second time. Your glass is never empty, you need something, someone is there to help you.  The hostesses are friendly and NICE (yes you read that RIGHT....this is a rarity in Scottsdale, in my opinion). They are accommodating and down to earth.  Food: It's a good menu, good amount of salads and pizza and starters. We have pretty much almost sampled all the starters, Def tasty. My only comment would be that the grilled vegetables should look a little more 'robust'. But still delicious. The pizza is a hit. The minestrone is good too.  The desserts are the highlight, we have eaten through 80% of them.  The atmosphere is fun, casual. There always seem to be tables. I appreciate the fun fresh aspect of this place, and its a good change from the other 'italian' places that are so watered down. Definitely going again."}
{"text":"From living in New Jersey, I can attest that the Italian style food served here is the real deal. From the pizza to pasta, everything is exceptional. Not only is the food great, but the service is truly EXCEPTIONAL. All the waiters are extremely attentive and clear plates immediately, are open to questions, refill water as soon as you finish, and our waiter even wiped off the spilled balsamic vinegar from the table within seconds. The interior is super modern and very well designed with bar seating as well. Great price too. Cannot say enough about this place!!! (Get the Nutella pizza- not on the menu, a hidden gem)."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! The atmosphere is modern while the food tastes like classic rustic Italian.   I had a basic cheese pizza and the caprese salad. While I would have preferred balsamic on my salad, it was quite refreshing. You can also purchase coffees and Italian grocery items.   From the hostess stand to the waiter, our service was fabulous. They had the right balance of attentiveness and allowing my family our space. I would highly recommend this pace for a date night! The lighting is perfect for a sweet first date."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I am a bit perplexed at the low rating I have to give the food!  Pomo seems to have a great reputation and is really hyped as tops on the pizza circuit. I consider myself quite the pizza snob, so I can't describe how excited I was to finally try Pomo in Scottsdale.  The restaurant itself is nice and has a great vibe, and our server was terrific. However, I thought the pizza was incredibly subpar. You can be certified all you want with the APN and VPN, but if you serve me a personal pizza that tastes like a piece of burnt charcoal... for $17, well you know what you can do with that certificate.  and that was it... my pizza was awful. I ordered the Diavolo, and the basil was the only ingredient that I could taste. The spicy salami, was really just mini pepperonis, and any flavor they had were totally overpowered by the most pungent basil I have ever tasted on a pizza. The ingredients and flavor profiles were completely out of balance!  And on top of that, the crust had nothing but the burnt taste of the oven. Honest, it was awful. I couldn't believe it, I so wanted to love Pomo, based on what I saw (the oven, the pizza chef) and what I read.  My two dining partners enjoyed their pizzas, but they weren't overly impressed either. So maybe just mine got overcooked and burnt.... But at that price... there isn't much incentive to come try it again.  The one good thing: the tiramisu was top notch. We all really loved it, but sadly it didn't do much to quell my pizza sadness.  If I were to rank Pomo, it falls very short of Chris Bianco's, the Parlor, Grimaldi's, and Cibo. Heck, I'd rather go to Sal's in Tempe.  If INVITED back, I would more than gladly do a redo on my pizza and update this review. But otherwise, the $70 I spent there will be a memory and warning to not always believe the hype, or hold stock in \"certification\"."}
{"text":"After being told this is a must try, I decided to take the plunge with my wife and some friends after a day of tanning during a stay-cation in the Gainey area. We arrived at around 8pm without reservations (I have read that they may be required) but we did not want a firm schedule, so we took the risk, and it played out strangely.   We walk in all looking a little worse for wear after having been in the sun for the better part of 8 hours, as we were staying at a nearby resort enjoying the weather. Perhaps this was the reason for the service we received, which included being told there weren't any tables ready, which we were fine with, but then being greeted by no less than three groups being seated before us even though they to admitted to the hostess that they did not have reservations!  We were a party of 4 and the groups seated before us, but after we put our name in, were all parties consisting of 2x4 & 1x2. Not a big deal, but I am certain this had more to do with the fact we were in board shorts, and our wives were in sun dresses with there hair up, than a lack of tables. My wife being a little put off approaches the hostess again to find out that luckily a table has just opened up! Hmmmm...   We are seated and greeted by an exceptionally nice waiter who offers water for the table, and asks if we would like any additional beverages. I ask what his wine suggestions would be, as this is an Italian restaurant whom people tout as having excellent regional food, to which I get a reply of \"I have no idea, I haven't been to Italy\" ..  Granted, We have been all over Italy, but even without having done that I would expect a waiter to have at minimum of 4 go to bottles to suggest for a guest who may not know what to expect from the wine selection.  Since he cannot help me out, I decide to go with a bottle of bubbly since it was a hot evening, and we were on the patio with friends, I felt it was an easier choice then trying to go through the motions of getting everyone's opinion and trying to please the crowd.   The waiter brings the bottle, without a chiller: hot night - chiller = gross champagne  Conversation ensues.... Chiller finally brought out.. Another bottle never offered.. Flutes never touched up..  We order Food:   PRINCIPE: (Pizza) Prosciutto Crudo di Parma DOP, Fresh Arugula,  Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano  This very same pizza can be had at Hanny's, but there it is made with some sense of care for the patrons eating it (toppings not just thrown on top and fired) The flavors were a little bland, the crust was still doughy, and the Parmiganiano was barely present.. I find that it is almost impossible to abort a pizza of this simplicity, but this completely missed the mark. I wish I had something good to say about it, but it just was not good, and more than half was left untouched.  LASAGNE AL FORNO: Layers of Lasagne Pasta with Homemade Meat Sauce, Besciamella Cream & Parmigiano Reggiano  Best way to describe it: Chef Boyardee canned lasagna - Watery, little meat, flat notes throughout, about the size of a small napkin and an inch tall.   That is it.  $15   At this point we decided dinner was over, as we were going to keep ordering dishes to share, but after two misses it just was no longer worth it.   Bad service, subpar food, and price points about $5 over what this food should be sold at. Also, This is not real Italian, unless you have never traveled through Italy, which is the point of view I assume most of the reviews are written from. Again, I really wanted to like this place after all I had read about it, but I cannot help but wonder if this is a case of people liking it simply to not be the guy who doesn't (Like the Pizzeria Bianco craze)"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in all of the Phoenix area.  It doesn't matter if you're in Downtown Phoenix or this new location in Scottsdale, you're going to get some of the best pizza you've ever had.    Today was my first venture into their new Scottsdale location.  A friend and I came here after a morning of watching golf at the Phoenix Open.  I've been going to their Downtown Phoenix location ever since it opened in 2013.  The Scottsdale location is nothing like the Downtown Phoenix location in terms of aesthetics and atmosphere.  Whereas their Phoenix location feels more like a small urban neighborhood haunt, this location feels much more like a large upscale suburban restaurant.  There's far more seating both inside and outside at this location and the restaurant also has a mozzarella bar and an assortment of italian grocery items.  That's not to say either location is better or worse than the other at all.  The setup of the Phoenix location works perfectly for the cultural melting pot downtown neighborhood, whereas this location fits perfectly into the more upscale affluent neighborhood it occupies.  But the biggest testament to their brand is whether their trademark pies at the Scottsdale location can match up to their Phoenix location.  Having split a Margherita and a Don Alfonso with my friend today I can attest to the fact that the quality here is as top notch as their Downtown location.  The crust has the same crunchy outside and soft delicious texture inside and the flavors of their ingredients are like a perfect symphony.  Perfect size, perfect temperature, perfectly neapolitan.  If there was one downside to this location, its that we didn't get offered the free fried dough and limoncello as we always have downtown.  But then again the downtown location didn't have a mozzarella bar and grocery operation either.  No matter which location you choose, you simply can't go wrong with the Pomo brand.  Authentic neapolitan pies crafted by a family of Italian immigrants with the certifications to back them up.  Bravo Pomo, you never cease to amaze."}
{"text":"I gave this business a less than favorable review previously due to a hostess who made a decision to not let our party of 14 enjoy happy hour at a table due to the bar only seating 5 when it is hot outside.   I was very impressed with how fast Cricket, the GM, replied to me and said that it was totally not what should have happened and asked me to give them another try.   Today I took my oldest son and two of my grandkids back to the same store. From the moment we arrived we felt very welcome, the host got the kids their coloring kids menus and we were seated promptly.   The kids loved their pizzas, not a bite left. I had the Don Alfonso Pizza and it was really tasty. My son had the Penne Boscaiola and I had to take a bite. This pasta was something I will have to return for this week. The cream sauce was not super heavy and had just the right mix of mushrooms, peas and meats   Everything was delish.   By the way, I did not announce my return so that I could get the normal treatment and experience it without any extra attention.    Redeemed!"}
{"text":"Pizza is just pizza, right? Nope! Wrong! Pizza is not just pizza; pizza is an art. And if you like edible art, you come to Pomo for pizza... why? Because the pizza is amazing! It's extremely fresh (the ingredients attest to this), the toppings are mouth-watering, and the crust is absolutely perfect -- not too thick, not too thin, and crispy (not soggy) deliciousness.  Placed a to-go order and they said it'd be ready in 10 minutes... I sped over there and arrived in about 12 minutes (don't get in my way when I'm hungry) -- but my pizza wasn't ready. No worries though; good things in life take time. So I waited and chatted with the extremely pleasant and wonderful staff -- some that are straight from Italy (that's how you know the pizza is simply amazing!!!), and it just adds to the ambiance of making you feel like you hopped in a teleportation device and went to Italy to pick up a fresh pizza. Well before I knew it, my pizza was ready and I was on my way. I barely made it with the smell of hot bubbling cheese next to me -- I wanted to pull over and eat the whole pizza by myself, forget sharing!   I highly recommend the Bufala Verace pizza!!! Hands down, my favorite!!! It's basically like a Margherita pizza, but better. I didn't think you could make a classic Margherita pizza better, but somehow Pomo did. Mmm... just writing this review is making me crave Pomo. I might just have to run over there and grab some pizza... you know, I think that's exactly what I'm going to do. Tootles!"}
{"text":"I love to eat from their appetizer menu. The rice balls and meat balls are to die for favorites. They sell good Italian wine too."}
{"text":"We ordered three items. The Frito Misto (Calamari) was very good! The Gamberi salad was so-so. The Quattro Stagioni (pizza) was not good. The sauce was very bland and not worth the price. Plus it was a little over cooked. Service was a bit slow too but it was busy."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday, dined later at night, and had excellent service.  Despite not having any Italian heritage, I like to think of myself as a tiramisu connoisseur.  Guess, what?  It was phenomenal!!!  Perhaps the best I have ever had....  light, fluffy, and delicious..."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Neapolitan pizza.  Fun place for a date night or a bite to eat when traveling for business.  Also would be great for small parties.  Ambience is moderately loud.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Valentine Dinner with friends  Everything was spot on... Service excellent  Apps and wine ...very very good  Arancini and meatballs were some of the best I have ever had Dinners were excellent, fresh ingredients and cooked perfectly  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Fun place. Great food! Friendly staff. They hosted us for an event for the 2nd year in a row. Owner is Stefan, & he is a great guy."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last week. The food was mediocre and the prices are on the high end. While we were there, we witnessed the owner, the waiter confirmed,  reprimanding a hard working busboy rather loudly, so that the customers could hear the verbal abuse. We also learned that at least 4 other employees have quit in the last week. Because of this persons behavior, we will never return to or recommend this restaurant to anyone. Too many other nice feeling restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This place was close by and had 4 star reviews so we decided to try it. The service was good but a tad slow at times until the next crew of servers arrived and ours had more help.  The dining room is modern looking with a high ceiling and rows of tables. A large covered outdoor space looks nice with large fan assisted misters for cooling.  The arancini are tasty and enormous - about the size of a baseball each, two for each order with marinara. They were filled with ground meat in tomato sauce, cubes of mozzarella and peas. The rice has a nice saffron flavor but not overpowering. The marinara sauce however was way too light and thin and lacked salt and flavor.  We ordered two pizzas - the quattro stagioni and the principe. The quattro stagioni was not your typical version with four distinct areas of separate ingredients on the pizza. This one had the four ingredients scattered all over the place - somewhat messy looking. It was also a bit wet in the center. We've had real Neapolitan pizza before and this seemed too wet - perhaps they are using fresh mozzarella which leaches out too much water in the oven?  The principe is a staple Neopolitan pizza (tomato sauce, a small amount of mozzzarella, then topped with prosciutto, arugula and parmesan after baking) and it had way too much mozzarella that leached out moisture making the center of the pizza really wet and sloppy. That diluted the flavors of the rest of the ingredients.  Others rave about the freshly made pasta - maybe that would be a better choice."}
{"text":"A Must visit in Scottsdale! Fantastic service! A little piece of Italy in Scottsdale! Excellent pizza and salads! Do not miss!"}
{"text":"We took friends to enjoy Pomo's food last night and it was a disappointment compared to our last visit.  The service was average at best.  Waiter did not offer good information about the food.  The pizzas were blend and lacked ingredients like basil, cheese in some.  One came over baked and burned.  The lasagna tasted processed.  Overall for what you pay, the pizzas tasted below average for the price you have to pay.     Pomo has a fabulous line up of gourmet pizzas and pasta dishes with many ingredients imported from Italy.  We had the buffalo verace and toto sapore (meat lover).  The atmosphere was great, service excellent.  The Nutella torte was very good but could have more hazelnut flavor. Be prepared to spend a few dollars for all the flavor, freshness and service.  We plan to go back!"}
{"text":"Pomo has the best pizza in town. I thought any mozzarella was good until I had their fresh mozzarella--I've never had anything like it. The ingredients in their pizzas are very fresh and high quality. The indoor atmosphere is upscale but not too fancy, and the patio is actually pretty pleasant for overlooking a shopping center parking lot. One of my favorite places to go for date night."}
{"text":"Great Italian restaurant and market. The mozzarella is fresh and very good. Wood fired oven pizzas, pasta, and more. They have the standard types of wood fired pizzas, and they do make them well and they have great flavor. They will also give you spicy olive oil to sprinkle on your pizzas and pasta if you like. The pasta is firm, just slightly softer than al dente, which I think is perfect! The staff is amazingly friendly, helpful, and prompt. Overall, a really good meal in a very pleasant and casual setting."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! Pizza and panini's are amazing! Definitely would come here again. They have a fast service casual side and a nicer side to eat. They also have a cute front patio. This is authentic Italian eating."}
{"text":"We took out of town guests here for dinner and enjoyed our entrees, but the bruschetta was terrible. Zero flavor, dry and the bread was dreadful.  It was embarrassing. You're an Italian restaurant with a pizza oven! WTH?  During our meal one person in our party asked for bread and was told he could get the bread and olive plate for an extra charge. We couldn't even purchase JUST BREAD to go with dinner.  This was our first and last visit.  They must have regulars because of the location and a great interior, but bad bruschetta is not ok.  This is a staple and it should be exemplary."}
{"text":"Really loved this place! Everything- the service, ambiance, food. All was excellent! The outside misters worked really well & made the patio a pleasant dinner experience despite the heat.   Great for groups and as a date place-- it's casual but classy, so it's a comfortable but slightly upscale experience.   The pizza was absolutely delicious! Crust was thin and chewy but also with the slightest bit of crisp. It's definitely a large pizza but not too filling since the crust is thin. Great to share if you get a salad and pasta dish as well.   The only dish I wasn't impressed with was the pasta dish we had. I love fresh pasta but the pasta here was too al dente-- chewy for me-- I like slightly al dente, but this one was working my jaw muscles a bit too much."}
{"text":"I have a list of places that I want teleported to Austin. This is one of those places.   The inside is just gorgeous -- clean and fresh but still warm and welcoming. Expect to be amazed by the incredible wood fired oven, catered to sweetly by the nicest, most efficient servers on the planet and to encounter the best tomatoes flown fresh from Italy every other day. This place is serious y'all.   Every bit of our meal was delightful. We oohed and aahed and exclaimed and ate. And ate. And ate. The meatballs, the caprese, the arancini can hold their own  among the allure of a big pizza pie. A hats off/high five/big hug to Stefano and crew for making a perfect Italian haven in the heart of Phoenix."}
{"text":"As they say, \"time marches on\".  The original POMO was a very special pizzeria, that transported it's diners back to Italy. It was located further south along Scottsdale Road in the Borgata Shopping Center, next to Blanco's. Though small, it had an intimate feel where you could have an easy conversation with you server.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/pomo-pizzeria-napoletana-scottsdale-2#hrid:DP4ygw0P_5831sjXGX5ecA  The \"new\" Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria feels like a concept restaurant, sort of like Fox's Olive & Ivy or North, which is not a bad thing. But gone is that old world Italian Grotto elegance and feel. I guess it's only fitting that it's in the former Blooms space.   Also gone is any mention of POMO's being a certified Napoletana pizzeria, from either APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani) or VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana). But in truth, the pizzas are still very good and they now have a new, much larger wood fired brick oven.   The square footage feels three times larger. At times it seems like a dozen or so wait staff are rushing around, delivering pizzas to almost forty tables and that is just inside the restaurant. The outside space is equally large, with a heavy duty tarp covering the diners. I eyed at least two Culinary Managers on the floor keeping track of the staff and food. Nice!   The three of us arrived around two o'clock on Black Friday. We were seated pretty quickly, with a good view of the pizza oven. I would highly recommend the location and view. The menu has been updated. And yes it may seem more expensive, given the pricier location near Gainey Ranch and the Hyatt Regency, but it's not.  http://www.pomopizzeria.com/pomo-scottsdale-menu.pdf.   I started out by ordering a Cappuccino ($4.00) which was as good as anything I've had at the green mermaid. It had a nice taste but lacked foam. My friends ordered a diet soft drink and a black ice tea, both $2.50.   Since we remembered how tasty the bruschetta was at the old POMO's we decided to start there. We had the Sorrentina for $7.95 (see photo), which was very good with a hint of garlic.   Next we decided to share two pizzas. One was their famous Regina Margherita.  It was as tasty and good (though somewhat smaller) as it's predecessor.  I've posted two pictures, a before and after if you will. It was priced at $12.95, same as before.    The other pizza was their Amatriciana, which comes with sauté onions and tiny amount of diced panchetta. It too was very good and priced at $14.95. I believe the key to their delicious tasting pizzas, is the constant and watchful eye as they cook in an over 850° F oven.   A new addition not found in the old Restaurante, is a grab and go sandwich annex, called \"Forno Fabbri, an Italian Market & Mozzarella Bar\".  It's to the left as you come into Pomo Cucina and very similar in size and setup to the ones found in Olive and Ivy or the Herb Box. It's a major plus for a quick weekday lunch, one which I will try in the near future.   Our total for three came to $48.42, including taxes but before gratuities. It seemed fair and the food as I've mention is very good. So Four Stars and yes, we are a Fan of the new Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"LOVE Pomo Pizza!! The pizza is THE best in town!!!! Great sitting out in the patio this time of year!"}
{"text":"Came here during the 3years Anniversary,  so I got the  $3 lunch deal which was a grilled chicken panini.  Very delicious and good size. The scenery is very nice with a wall of wine entrance. I sat in the bar area to be near the sun (glass windows). My waitress and hostess was very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I was craving Italian food so my wife and I set out to find a place relatively close to home. We have never dined at Pomo and I am asking myself, \"why!!!\"  Upon arrival, about 630p on a Tuesday night, we were immediately greeted and seated outside. Our server, I didn't get his name, was friendly without being over the top. Service was on point and the best part....the gnocchi was delicious!!!  The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is my wife meal was a bit off on flavor. However, our server, took it back brought her out a new dish and all was perfect.  Would I go back... yes Would I recommend...yes Is it good for kids...yes Is it expensive...it's appropriately priced"}
{"text":"Authentic wood-fired Italian pizza.    We ordered a number of appetizers that were all good.  We had the bruschetta, arancini, and the crocchette pugliesi.  They were all good.   For dinner I had the pizza Capricciosa.  The pizza was classically made; thin, relatively soft in the middle, with a chewy slightly burned crust.  Delicious.  Some people don't like how the tip of a slice of this kind of pizza is limp, but it's due to how thin the crust is and the tomato sauce and toppings tend to weigh it down.     We were a party of 10, and everyone enjoyed their food.  One person, someone who knows their pasta, got a penne with tomato sauce and didn't like it because it was too al dente.  Otherwise, everything was great.    We finished with gelato and profiteroles which were very good.  We came back a second time because of the overall quality and options."}
{"text":"Though the service was exceptional, the food did not match up.  We had The bruschetta and a meatball appetizer.  Tomatoes on bruschetta were tasteless and a pale pink.  blech!  The meatball appetizer tasted good, but for $9 I expected more than 2 meatballs the size of a golf ball.  Pizza wasn't bad.  Just nothing I'd go back for"}
{"text":"I went here last night with a party of 6.  We had a reservation and were seated relatively promptly.  We were seated in the patio area which wasn't bad at all because they had ample heat lamps.  Everybody was very comfortable.  Anyway, about the food:  * Skip the Romana (Caesar) salad.  It really has no taste, but the croutons are good.  * Also pass on the (Forno Fabbri) which is the bread they should just put on the table when you sit down instead of overcharging you $2 for it.  It pisses me off when restaurants do this.  * The Verdure Grigliate (grilled vegetables) were excellent.  I need to learn how to make these myself.  * We got 3 pizzas and it really doesn't matter what they were because they were all excellent.  Each one was better than the last.  The crust is sensational.  Easily made my top 5 pizzas in the Valley.  The place is gorgeous, its an older crowd so you don't get a lot of doucebags, and the service is excellent.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Love the food but the service absolutely ruins the place. We could barely get our server to refill our drinks even once. And then it took her well over 15 mins to run our credit card and bring back the bill. It took us less time to eat our dinner for heavens sake!  I would love to go back but only if they fix their service problems. Too many customers and not enough staff to handle it!  Plus the female manager was more concerned with checking her hair in the reflection of the windows than checking on tables. You're at work not a beauty pageant!"}
{"text":"So glad I heard about this place through friends. The pizza as well as the pasta dishes were exactly what I was hoping for . I liked the polpette and margherita pizza. The afogatto was a great way to top off the meal. I'll be heading back soon!"}
{"text":"Started with what was supposed to be an Antinori Chardonnay that tasted like a cheap Sauvignon Blanc. Really bad wine and I know Antinori wines are not like this. (Paid $13 for a 5 oz pour) Ordered a mango salad which was so drenched in salad dressing it was not edible. The bruschetta also disappointing. Would never come back. The pizzas look good but I was too disgusted to order anything more."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service. Our group of 3 ordered different items and every single one was tasted amazing. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The best thing about our meal was the tiramisu   desert and our waiter. We ordered the caprese salad, eggplant appetizer, promo pizza and nine layer baked lasagna. The salad was just a basic ordinary salad not a lot of taste. The pizza was undercooked and very limp and  tasteless should've been cooked another 30 seconds -1 minute.....you think in a famous pizza place (and for the $$$$) like that every pizza should be perfect. The lasagna was partially burnt on the top mushy noodles and very tasteless! The egg plant Parmesan was also very mushy, but not horrible.  Sorry but keeping in honest!!"}
{"text":"I was a big fan of the old Pomo having gone there with family a couple of years ago.  Yes, the intimate feel is gone but the service and the food is still top notch.   They brought that mural of Sicily from the old place over to this new location. We were with two family members so we started with a couple appetizers,  the Caprese and something I have never had before, the Crocchete Pugliesi (potato croquettes filled with Fior di Latte and prosciutto). Both were excellent and reasonably priced.   Then on to our personal pizzas.  I had the Principe (prosciutto, arugula and shaved parmigiano reggiano). The wife had the Peppino ( ricotta cheese, hot calabrese salami). On the advice of a family member we tried the pizza with a drizzle of their hot pepper flake olive oil.  OMG. I will be doing that from now on. The pizzas were as good as I remembered from the old place and made a great midnight snack straight out of the refrigerator.  :)  I really liked the take out and market place on the left as you walk in.  From what I am told it is a very popular lunchtime option which they didn't have at the old Pomo."}
{"text":"I got the pizza. They used high quality ingredients but it wasn't for me. We do pizza every Tuesday at a different place. This didn't do much for me. It was okay."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!!! Absolutely loved this place!! The food was delicious and the service was awesome!!! Lauren our server was awesome and informative!! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First time to Pomo. Our waiter Landon, was awesome. I didn't see a mozzarella Caprese in the menu so I asked and Landon made it happen. It was the best buffalo mozzarella from Campan'a I've ever had. We had a Quattro meat pizza with anchovies that did not disappoint.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great pizza and pasta. Fresh and not insanely priced. Dessert was so-so. I want to come back for the market."}
{"text":"This is one of my guilty pleasures. The food always speaks directly to my soul and fills me with joy. I am sad that they new location doesn't have the same charm as it did in the Borgata. It feels way more suburban and commercial now that i has moved."}
{"text":"Food not bad, had stozzapreti salsiccia with italian sausage [which is popular per the manager], but lacking italian sausage. Hardly any at all. Too pricey for $17.00 need more sausage. Red wine list a little over priced for a glass."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've had anywhere.  Quality ingredients, great oven, and caring staff really help to add to the ambiance here.  The diavola, pepino, and marinara pizzas are amazing, and as I'm writing this review I'm slowly selling myself on the fact that I may have to go there for dinner tonight.  The wine list with a bunch of different Italian selections by the glass also adds to why this is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.  If I could give one suggestion, when you eat here, order more!  Buy three pies for 2 people and take the rest home.  It's great the next day after being heated in the oven for a few minutes.  The arancini and meatballs are also worth considering to start the meal."}
{"text":"Their lasagna is so good!! Not sure what kind of cheese they put in it, it's so creamy. The pasta is well cooked and very thin. We also try their tiramisu dessert and it so yummy! It's lacking a star because our server was not very attentive. Didn't ask to refill our drinks and we have to look for her for our check. Price is pricey for the small portion but it's Scottsdale so as expected."}
{"text":"I've gone here twice for client meetings and it served that purpose well. Excellent service and nice atmosphere. The food is a little over-priced mostly because it's good, but not great. We purchased a personal pizza, salad, soup and a small noodle/beef dish. Price was $68 before tip.The soup was very good.  The pizza and salad were decent. The noodle dish was enjoyable, but salty. Nonetheless, I'd go again for business purposes. If not for business, I'd choose another restaurant. But again, very good service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"So far my favorite Italian joint in town for a number of reasons. 1) Authentic and fresh, yet American-friendly enough for the masses 2) Great presentation and service 3) Family friendly enough to take my small children Their pasta is freshly made in house along with many other ingredients that are locally harvested.  I nice date spot as well as informal enough for the family.  Their salads are perfectly balanced, their pizza dough outstanding and their pasta as fresh as can be."}
{"text":"4 stars. Nobody is perfect. Pomo is pretty darn close. OMG ! The pizza is to die for! Thin crust, wood fired. So flavorful. Each bite. Yummo! Our server, Landon, was excellent. Right on with his recommendations! Thank you, Pomo!  I wish I had discovered you earlier in the week. Heading back home to Colorado tomorrow. We will be back, though. Next year."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Great vegetables panini for lunch. Delicious. My husband had the chicken panini and loved it and the kids were happy with their pizza. Try it!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings- Loved the atmosphere. Service was great. Prices were slightly high but still reasonable. Food was served at temp and wine list was impressive, for how small it was. Negatives- I don't care for \"flimsy\" pizza and this is pizza that will not hold the toppings. So- order a cheese and leave it at that. Tiramisu was as good as it gets. Lasagna made with ground beef instead of sausage? It's good but- I don't recommend it if you want a bold flavor. Speaking of that- pizza sauce was mild and not enough on mine (although, it would have just run off). Pizza dough was so good I could not believe it. So- another visit is in order. Sit at the bar. Order beer and get a cheese pizza. Maybe put a topping on the side so it won't slide off!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend because the owner have us a gift card and we decided to come finally! The location: perfect. Right off doubletree and Scottsdale rd. When you first see the restaurant there is a good vibe right off the bat. we sat at the bar and Taylor took care of us, she was very friendly and knew her drinks. She definitely kept us entertained and had something to talk about while I had my Gnocchi which was delicious!! Everything about this place is good. I will come back for the service, the food of course and the prices. Also i will promote this place even though I work at a restaurant across the street. Shh"}
{"text":"The food and drinks were amazing!!! If you can't decide where to go come here. We shared a pizza and gnocchi and we didn't leave a bite left. The manager Cricket made it a special night for us with top notch service and food."}
{"text":"I had a FABULOUS exsperience at Pomo. You walk in and it's so airy, modern and beautiful. I partially liked the wall with the potted fresh herbs growing. Pomo serves certified Neapolitan Pizzas among many other Italian dishes like pastas and rice balls.  Our server was extremely welcoming and very knowledgeable about the menu and in Italian food in general.  I decided to order one of the seasonal special pizzas called the Stracchino and Rucola because I never had Stracchino Cheese before. I soon receive the pizza and everything thing about it was perfect. A nicely prepared crust with good structure and chewiness, the sweetest charred cherry tomatoes, peppery fresh arugula, and that very special melty, creamy more flavorful than mozzarella cheese with the perfect touch of Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It was a delicious pizza and I'm glad I ordered it.  This really was a 5 star exsperience.   Due to I go out to eat often and have been to many places I've come to the conclusion that pizza places can't be five stars because pizza making is part science and also mostly INTUITION you vary the recipe on the the humidity and the life in the yeast. I've been to Pizzeria Bianco and La Piazza al Forno a number of times and I can tell you they aren't consistent so I don't expect that Pomo can be consistent either.  If I have three consecutive perfect pizzas from Pomo I will change my rating to 5 stars.  4.5 stars"}
{"text":"People who complain don't know what they are talking about and need to travel to the Naples region of Italy where pizza is amazing. We came into town for a wedding and when I learned Naples certified pizza was here we had to try it. Amazing pizza. Owner very friendly and accommodating. Owners family and my family are from the same town in Italy. Thank you for showing the U.S. Quality pizza. My kids ate a ton of pizza and even ate the crust. They never eat the crust."}
{"text":"Very authentic. The people are very nice. Cute on the inside and outside. Decent prices. I got the Capri panini with the Zuppa Al Funghi (homemade creamy mushroom soup). Omg it was so good! Very tasty. The mushroom soup is different but amazing. The sand which is big and coma with salad. Very impressed. :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant ambiance is very nice.  Great decor and fantastic outdoor space.  My average rating is due to service.  The staff at check-in is inattentive.  Other wait and bar staff are completely frenetic in their pace.  I'm not used to seeing waiters run and bussers throw down place settings.  This is a great place but needs help with service.  PS - the pizza is excellent!"}
{"text":"My born and raised Italian family decided to go here for dinner one night. We went here for a surprise birthday dinner for my uncle. We sat outside as we were a big group, waiting for his arrival. The misters were on, but it was more like taking a shower than a gentle mist...to say the least. We then ordered our food and drinks. The pizza dough was soggy and didn't hold it's shape (or the toppings for that matter). The food was over priced for its \"quality\". Hopefully his next birthday will be something he'll never forget. Never making this mistake again."}
{"text":"If you are serious about Pizza your journey begins and ends here my friend. Affable owner, Stefano Fabbri will welcome you with open arms.  To experience Pomo is to experience pizza completely faithful to the vision that was nourished on the slopes of grand Vesuvius.  His new market is also laden with the finest Italian imports.  Close your eyes, listen to the music of Eros Ramazzotti in the back ground, and take a deep breath. It might look modern and sleek but it is still Italian to its core."}
{"text":"Lovely place, yummy food! Authentic technique and flavors combined, they serve the best pizza in town! The desert was awesome too! Chocolate nutella filled cake and tiramisu - absolutely irresistable."}
{"text":"We have been dining here since it opened.  Have to say, it is still my favorite place for homemade pizza, pasta and salad ~ not to mention their wonderful desserts.  Customer service is the BEST.  We had a small oversight on our last visit... Shelly jumped into action and took care of us.  Up and beyond what was needed or expected.  She gets an \"A\" grade for taking care of the customers.  Our waiter Kris was awesome too.  He recommended a couple of their specials which were delicious.  So nice that they take reservations as well."}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing food, amazing service, amazing ambience. I have no idea why it took me a year and a half after moving here to try this place because tbh I was really depriving us. I have two under 2 and we don't get out much for dates so we decided to bring them along! They BOTH enjoyed items like the mushroom soup, croquette, bruschetta and the carbonara. So yeah, it's good. My toddler ate it all. You even have the option of buying delicious Italian truffles, oils, butters, etc. I guess I know where I'll be buying Christmas gifts this year! I cannot wait to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all;(  Bar drinks.....don't waste your money, the food so so.... Actually went twice to make sure that maybe I had just gone on a bad nite.  I wish they would refund our money!!!"}
{"text":"Really 2 1/2 stars. We were disappointed.  Four adults for Sunday dinner. 2 pizzas, 3 salads, 1 soup, 1 wine, 2 beers, $100.00  Mango salad was awful.  Didn't finish. Pizza crust soggy in middle, burned on edges.  One salad very good, as well as the mushroom soup Very noisy, but attractively done. Service was excellent.  Doubt that any of us will return.  I came home and made something to eat."}
{"text":"Beautiful Shannon M's last gift to me before she left.  The gift of another pizzeria to enjoy in her absence.  I liked the floor plan with the inside/outside bar.  Clearly I am behind in my reviews because I have not seen outside in several months.  We shared two pizzas and a fried calzone (the Vesuvio) among 3 of us.  It was all pretty great.  I did have to ask what a few of the ingredients were, but the server was more than willing to educate me with enthusiasm.  There's also a small grocer on one side where you can pick up a quick lunch or ingredients to use at home.  Definitely worth a return visit!"}
{"text":"They serve the fancier thin crust everyone seems to serve, it's not a bad thing. The Margarita was delicious. We all had salads with salmon. The Caesar comes with kale, but I chose traditional. It's very good without a heavy dressing. What made this a five star night was the waiter. Ben was awesome. He just did everything right, and just cared about our enjoyment. The room is open and bright. They also have a nice big patio."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The staff was very attentive and the facility was great. I always base my reviews on the pizza. As always I got a Margherita pizza, They offered buffalo mozzarella so I went with that. The presentation and the flavor were great and overall it was a very good product. I ordered it uncut so I could use a fork and knife and what I found was that the dough was a little crisp. It is great for eating with your hands but in my opinion strays a little from a true Neapolitan Pizza. Other than that I have no complaints and if I could give them 4 1/2 stars I would:)"}
{"text":"Casual environment, authentic Sicilian pizza, thin, fresh, wood fired. Outstanding service and great pizza. Meatballs were outstanding as well. Highly recommend and bring the kids - outdoor misters are great for the hot Scottsdale nights! Pizzas are enough to feed 2-3 ppl."}
{"text":"Need I say more?  See my pic...The Lasagna was impressive!  The best I've had and of course with the béchamel sauce and not the typical ricotta..."}
{"text":"I am very happy with the new location! Everything in terms of service and quality of food remainder the same and now the addition of more space and the grab and go grocery area just make the experience that much better!   I've been lucky enough to visit Italy and try authentic Italian pizza. While I have tried the Napolean pizza, I will say that it was in Rome and not Naples, but that didn't seem to make a difference in taste to me. Needless to say, the pizza I had in Rome was the pizza I use to weigh against any other slice of pizza. Pomo Pizzeria has come pretty darn close to authentic pizza in my book.   Make a reservation because it will fill up, especially on the weekends!  We started with the bruschetta and Cesar salad (Romana) to share. The salad is huge and you could probably share it with two to three other people. It was zesty, creamy and delicious. The order of bruschetta gave us two pieces of bread heaping with tomatoes and mozzarella. I got a side of vinegar which was the perfect touch. If you are with a party of more than two, I'd suggest ordering two orders of bruschetta or you can cut each slice in half.   Now let's move on to the pizza, for this is what Pomo Pizzeria is known for is it not? Oh friends, the pizza is exactly what you hope for it. It tastes like it's straight from the streets in Italy. We got the Quattro Stagioni which has tomato, San Marzano DOP, mozzarella, fior di latte, sauteed mushrooms, Italian Sausage, etc. The bread was thin crust but soft and melted in my mouth. The crust was fluffy and soft. The pizza is definitely large enough to split and the combo of salad, bruschetta and pizza worked out perfectly. The reviews are right in saying that this pizza is absolutely excellent and comparable to the other great pizza places in the Valley and their new location allows even more people to enjoy it now!"}
{"text":"First off I had no idea what to expect walking into this restaurant. My friends and I walked in and right away the workers at the front reception looked at us weird. They were really rude and asked if had reservations, we did not so we had to sit on the \"casual\" side. The restaurant separates reservations from non reservations which is odd.  The food is overpriced as well."}
{"text":"Margherita Pizza! Best one on the menu. I also love the white pizza. They have an amazing Bellini here as well. This place reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples, Italy! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good flavor profiles.  Eggplant Parmesan excellent but GF Pizza dough unsuccessful.  Best GF pizza crust so far is Zaza's in Little Rock, AR."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here as much as we can. The pizza is absolutely amazing and the service has always been phenomenal. It's in a perfect location and the prices are very reasonable. Definitely the best pizza I've ever had thus far!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my trip to Pomo Pizzeria in Scottsdale; and while their service and atmosphere were both great, the pizza itself didn't blow me away.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Pomo Pizzeria has some serious real estate, but they make good use of it with abundant and varied seating and a full bar. My server couldn't have been nicer, and the pies come out quick. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  The pies at at Pomo range between $15.00 and $19.00, and for that you get a pizza that could comfortably feed two for lunch. Those are reasonable prices, and I opted for the below:  Diavola: $14.95 Ortolana: $15.95 Quattro Formaggi: $14.95   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  The diavola was without a doubt the standout pizza from Pomo, and while the crust was a bit on the soggy side in the middle as others have mentioned, the toppings carried the day.   Having said that, the Ortolana disappointed a little bit, and the Quattro Formaggi had a very odd flavor profile that I didn't love. Single Star.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Pomo Pizzeria is worth your visit, but I've simply had pizzas elsewhere with better crusts and toppings. No Star."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by a meal at Pomo. The pizzas are amazing, the desserts are delicious, and the service is always on par. They definitely do their best to accommodate and satisfy!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Scottsdale by far. Perfect neopolitan style pizza. Bartender also recommended an Italian beer that I've never had before.  It was great."}
{"text":"I've had Pomo bookmarked for a long time, and I'm so glad I finally went! I just wish we'd gone sooner so I could've been going here for a while now lol. I think this is a good weekend date night spot; we went on a Saturday night around 8, and it was easy to get a table yet not too empty. The Scottsdale location is really big, with lots of different seating options - a bunch of tables indoors, a nice patio and seating at the bar both inside and out. I also loved the way it was decorated and of course the big pizza oven! :)   We started with the Bruschetta Classica, and that was delicious. The tomatoes were fresh and the olive oil tasted amazing with the bread. I loved how it was a little salty, but not too much. I think it's a really good deal for the price, too!   For dinner we split the Margarita pizza and Strozzapreti Salsiccia. The pasta was amazing; I loved the sauce and the noodles it's made with, and the sausage was really yummy. The Margarita pizza was very good too, though not the best I've had. I think it could have used a lot more mozzarella, as ours didn't have very much (I noticed the people at the table next to us each got a Margarita pizza and theirs had a lot more cheese!). We split each of these between two people, and it was filling but not so much we had leftovers - not quite the huge portions a lot of pasta dishes come with!   Then, we got the tiramisu for dessert, which we both loved. It was chocolatey and fluffy, and super creamy. So good!! It also looked really pretty the way they served it to us. My boyfriend also got an espresso - not my thing but he seemed to like it lol. I'm ready to come back here anytime!"}
{"text":"This is the best of the best.  It's incredible that in Scottsdale we have a pizzeria of this quality.  If you like the Napoletana style pizza, then this is your place.  It's a cool, almost chic, vibe and everything they prepare here is of the highest quality.  Whether you have a salad, pasta or pizza, it will be a cut above here.  They also have a nice wine list and try to have a few bottles in the low $30s/bottle for those who don't like spending 3x times costco for an average bottle of wine.  Stefano is rapidly becoming one of the best restauranteurs in Arizona.  Come here for high quality cuisine and some liveliness."}
{"text":"Most of you know, I have an affinity for Neapolitan style pizza. And that's what makes Pomo Pizzeria in Scottsdale one of my favorite places to eat.   The thing I love most about Neapolitan style pizza is that I never walk away with a \"brick\" in my stomach...the dreaded \"I just ate pizza\" feeling.  ...Neapolitan style pizza is so light and satisfying, you'll never look at pizza the same way again!!  The lay of the land...  Pomo is located in the Shops at Gainey Village on the corner of Scottsdale Road. and Doubletree Blvd. The interior boasts high ceilings, an array of windows, and an indoor/outdoor bar concept.    But don't let the sleek and modern atmosphere fool you...the centerpiece of the whole operation is a hand-built, wood-burning oven crafted from bricks and volcanic sand from Southern Italy.  The oven is like a time machine that can transport your taste buds back hundreds of years to the heart of Napoli, Italy.  And it's right there in plain sight so you can watch the magic unfold.  Carpaccio Di Bresaola, the perfect starter...  Start your experience with a platter of razor-thin slices of tender cured beef carpaccio, buried under a pile of peppery arugula salad, tossed in a light lemon vinaigrette, and topped with Parmigiano Reggiano shavings.  There's plenty to share, and it's not too filling so it's the perfect way to start your authentic Italian journey.  Slow-rising Sourdough Crust...  The secret to Pomo's light and chewy crust lies in the highly-refined, organic wheat flour imported 6,267 miles from Molino Caputo in Naples. This slow-rising sourdough takes 24 hours to rise and only 60-90 seconds in the 905 degree oven to produce a piping hot pizza with bubbly cheese and a perfectly charred crust.  The Bufala Verace -- it's what dreams are made of...  The beauty of this pie lies in the simplicity of the ingredients: Tomato, basil, cheese. That's it. With every bite there's a burst of tang from the crushed tomato base, holding hands with creamy Mozzarella di Bufala D.O.P., and a fresh basil finish.  What is D.O.P.?  You'll notice several items on the menu with initials D.O.P.  This stands for the Italian phrase \"Denominazione d' Origine Protetta\".  It means the product is a higher level of certification and authenticity.  It could easily stand for \"Definitely Oozes Perfection\". ;-)  Mozzarella di Bufala D.O.P. is a superior mozzarella cheese made from Italian water buffalo milk, and imported fresh each week. And Tomato San Marzano D.O.P. are the only kind of tomatoes have been designated as the ONLY tomatoes that can be used for a TRUE Neapolitan style pizza.  Ask for a some chili oil to drizzle over the top and dip your crust in if you like a little kick!!  Toppings vs. purity...  If you're American, you're probably used to Supreme or Meat Lovers Deluxe style pizza --- more toppings the better.  In Napoli, this would be a crime... punishable by starvation or firing squad.    Neapolitan style pizza typically has more sauce than cheese, leaving a wet and slightly soggy middle which is why Italians dig in to their pies with a fork and knife.  When you taste The Bufala Verace in it's pure form, your outlook on pizza will be forever changed!!  With food and love,  -Ashley  P.S. When you visit Pomo Pizzeria, please let them know you read my review.  And then, come back here and tell me about your experience.  I love to hear from my readers and get feedback from friends!!"}
{"text":"Not the kind of Pizza that I enjoy. It is wet in the middle and soggy. I think when people hear that it is authentic Naples high standard specially approved. They are supposed to like it. The3 star rating is for their Pastas, salads and service. A very well run restaurant. Just not good Pizza."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time and was a little disappointed when I finally did. I went in for lunch and the service was pretty slow and the food was just okay. I think they only had 3 servers for the whole restaurant.   We ordered Mango salad and Quattro Stagioni Pizza. The Pizza was a little too toasty and a little burned. If you can get passed that, the toppings was pretty tasty. The salad was probably the best part of the meal.   Overall this place is visually nice and food was decent for the price, but would not be my first choice to get pizza. I hope the other locations is better."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place with one of my gal pals.   Sat at the bar, and Tony was our bartender.  Super kudos to Tony, first off.   If I was rating Tony, I'd give him four stars.   Very professional, helpful, and friendly.  Since we were there during happy hour, we decided to try a few things on the HH menu.  We ordered the calamari, the mozzarella fritta, and the panzerotti.  I had the well whiskey martini.   Didn't care for the well whiskey; therefore, had the angel's envy martini.   That's what I'd call a decent whiskey.   Very smooth.  I also ordered the minestrone.  The minestrone, was, well, minestrone.   Nothing that made it stand out.   As far as the calamari and the two other fried appetizers, I must admit, I wouldn't order them again.   I felt the calamari was bland, and the other two over-fried and heavy.  They came with marinara sauce, which I don't care for, so I asked for other items in which to dip the food and cut the grease.  Tony graciously and immediately ran over to the kitchen and came back with two more dips, one which was a sort of creamy dip (I don't know what it was -- something like ranch dressing) and something else.   I liked the \"ranch dressing\" dip.  Perhaps I will try it for dinner.   I know I wouldn't go for the HH food.   The Angel's Envy martini was good."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday evening. Not the first time. Not the best and disappointed.  $7 for a draft beer, $8 for 3 small profiteroles in a large plates, $9 most of the desserts, come on...oh yeah, it's Scottsdale, so your charge more and more. Pizzas were undercooked, way less testy than usual. 4 locations now, and as always, the quality is going down. Take a break, spend time in Italy and come back with less pricy food."}
{"text":"Pasta carbonara is one of the best we have had and their gluten free pizza is delicious!"}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot better now that they've moved from the Borgata.  It's a nice open floor plan and I love the outside patio and bar area.  My pizza was great and I'm pleased to see their nice selection of Italian wines."}
{"text":"Delicious margarita pizza, wonderful salads, and terrific service with a smile from our waiter with NJ roots! Soup was salty and so hot I burned the roof of my mouth which affected the rest of my Arizona trip. Totally my fault but kind of a bummer for a foodie like me. Would go there again. Outdoor seating is basically inside the parking lot. Indoors is probably the nicer way to go :)"}
{"text":"There is not enough positive feedback that I can provide regarding the food and service at Pomo Pizzeria in Scottsdale.  My guest and I will be loyal customers.  I will continue to highly recommend Pomo Pizzeria in Scottsdale to my family, friends, clients, team members, etc."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall; the pizza is the bomb; the service - so so.  The prices - a bit on the high side, but this is snottsdale.  Beats most of the other 'italian' places nearby; we come back often, but almost always and only for pizza.  One big plus is the excellent selection of Italian wines by the glass; we've tried them all; but great to see wines of Veneto, Sicily, and Piedmont among the usual Tuscan offers."}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza you will eat in the while Valey! Very recommended and you can also find them in down town Phoenix."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be in The Borgata and is now located in the Gainey Village Shops. The inside is the same as the other restaurant, casual with a huge photograph of a street in Italy that takes up the entire wall. Now I am fussy about Pizza and nothing on the menus really struck me. I love good italian sausage and pepperoni and they did not have pepperoni, I decided on the Homemade Tomato soup and Bruchetta . All I can say is that it lacked flavor. The tomato soup was bland and when I added salt and pepper it did not change the flavor much. Not what I expected. The Bruchetta was bland also. While Arizona tomatoes are bland, the only thing I tasted was garlic. No other spices which could zip up this dish. friends had the Chicken salad. My friend said the lemon dressing was bland. She got a different dressing but said it was nothing special. My husband had pasta marinara and my husband said it was good, bold flavor but not enough sauce. Our other friend had a pizza with peppers, sausage and mushrooms and he said it was ok. I think I will try another Italian restaurant, Phoenix does not have many outstanding Italian restaurants or bakeries."}
{"text":"Pizza very good just rude hostesses. Went to the restaurant side and asked for a table. Three hostesses were present. Neither one of them was interesting in helping or explaining the two sides of the restaurant. We ended up getting take out pizza from the other side of the restaurant. It was great pizza."}
{"text":"We had heard good things about Pomo Pizzeria and after they won the Phoenix Business Journal Pizza Madness competition we made plans to try it.   We went to the Scottsdale location.     The interior is very nice - more upscale than some other pizza spots.   We sat outside in the large covered outdoor seating area (very nice on a warm night).     We told the waiter we were in a hurry and they were very accommodating at getting our pizzas out quickly - the Principe and the Don Alfonso.  Would we rate it #1 for pizza?  No, but both of them were good.  The ingredients tasted fresh, the crust was thin but pliable.  The one downside was the floury taste - too much raw flour left on the crust.        We'll return to try some other menu items especially since the atmosphere is so nice."}
{"text":"Pomo's move to this new location was definitely for the best... not only do they have the addition of Forno Fabbri 1949 (the market / mozzarella bar which I still need to try) under the same roof, but the entire space is gorgeous and the patio + indoor / outdoor bar is perfect!  I've been in several times, and I've never been disappointed.  The food and drinks are authentic, the staff are all friendly and knowledgeable, but the real reason to head to Pomo is to meet the owner, Stefano Fabbri.    I recently heard a Maya Angelou quote that I liked. It goes something like this: People will forget what you said. People will forget what you did. But people will never forget how you made them feel.   The reason I stick this quote in the middle of a Yelp review is because of Stefano.  He will make you feel like a VIP, and it's not just me... he works the room like a pro.  His accent, passion, and engaging personality will put a smile on your face and definitely make you want to return again and again...  Add to that your choice of cocktail or wine, antipasti, zuppe, insalate, pasta, and/or some Napoletana pizza straight from the wood burning oven... and you're sure to be one happy camper!  Note: Pomo's pizza is cerfied by the V.P.N. Verace Pizza Napoletana and the A.P.N. Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani, both associations are based in Napoli, Italy.  It's the real deal!  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the above... but some standout menu items in my opinion are: *Arancini Siciliani (Homemade Fried Rice Ball, Fior di Latte, Sweet Peas, Meat Sauce ) *Zuppa Al Funghi (Homemade Creamy Mushroom Soup, Fresh Mushrooms, Onions, Evoo) *Lasagna and/or Gnocchi *Pizza classica: Napoli, Toto Sapore, and/or Capricciosa  Lastly, my advice to you: no matter what time of day or day of the week you plan on going: make a reservation!  The word on Pomo is out and it can get packed!  Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"We come here to listen to the band! Love there sound! The host was so accommodating and moved us to a table we liked better! We got to keep our sweet waitress Malinda.  Heirloom Burrata with fig sauce was very nice. (Needed more fig sauce) The Pomo pizza had fresh toppings but I like my pizza a little more crunchier.  Another lovely night at Pomo"}
{"text":"I came on a Friday evening when there was a large party and perhaps that is what made the evening just OK.  The pasta dishes were just that, pasta and some sauce.  There is no bread offered and getting a refill on your water was tough.  The waiter was too busy.  We had to sit in the gelato side.  I believe his section was actually o the other side of the building.  I did enjoy the eggplant appetizer, but when I told the assistant manager that the pasta was not so great, she said she would bring me another that she thought I would enjoy.  When the bill arrived, I was charged for the newer pasta which was more expensive.  The waiter felt that was correct.  You pay for the one you replaced it with!  Obviously customer service is done a little differently there.  Not in any hurry to go back!"}
{"text":"This is Italia Pizza heaven. (PERIOD)  Watch them make your perfectly cooked thin crust masterpiece right in front of your eyes.  The brick oven is the centerpiece of the new location.  The outdoor patio is great, lots of bar seating in and outdoors.  The main dining room fills up so make a reservation-- and if you are last minute just sit up at the Pizza bar and literally observe the pizza making operation.  The food is just GOOD!  The salads are HUGE and should be shared.  The pizzas are pretty much good for one unless you are sharing a salad.    There's no need to waste calories anywhere else. Pomo is dishing out the very best Pizza in town.    The wine list is sufficient with plenty of drinkable options at good prices.  Back to the Pizza-- the ingredients are simple, fresh, flavorful, and leaves you wanting more.  The dough is perfect and you will be fighting over the last piece of crust, especially with the red flake chili oil they offer.  If you have a sweet tooth, their deserts are top-notch. Without question the best Tiramisu in all of Arizona!!!  When you are craving pizza nothing is going to beat Pomo for a real Italia experience.   This is yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently delicious, the patio is fantastic and our server Marie was so friendly and accomodating. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We had been here before and had great food and service. However this time when we went we were completely ignored by our server and I'm sure it's because we don't look like your typical Scottsdale person. So I finally asked who was our server and the lady who sat us told us it was Ben. Well Ben finally came over and took our drink orders. Again, we waited. I saw him help another table again before helping us. Well Ben you lost a good tipper all because you judged a book by it's cover!!  **Update** I want to say thank you to Cricket the GM for reaching out to me and doing everything possible to fix the situation! We will give Pomo another try!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, their pizza is incredible. They cook it for a minute and a half in a 900 degree oven:-) service was incredible friendly, helpful, and welcoming. Would absolutely return and recommend to anyone looking for amazing Italian cuisine:-)"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try Pomo, but now I'm not sure why we waited!  You can make reservations easily on Open Table, which is a huge plus in the busy Scottsdale market.  We have never had to wait for a table here!  The pizzas are excellent and have large portions.  The salads are also great.  Try saving room for dessert - the tiramisu is excellent!"}
{"text":"Food is good here but goodness the service... be ready to be patient... like REALLY REALLY patient. This is the second time I have brought a 12 top here  and it's been a disaster. I had to go to the bar to get refill on the drinks, ask the manager for first rounds of water at the table. Maybe a nice date night spot but don't plan to bring a big group here."}
{"text":"It's tough to judge pizza & pasta on a delivery in true fairness. We used Postmates & because the pizza is so thin had to reheat it. Hubby thought it was great. I ordered him the sausage pasta & it was good. I had the Bolognese pasta. I thought it was fair. The peas in it seemed to be canned & I could not get past that. Also their was so much more pasta than sauce I felt like I was just eating pasta. Not a fan. My husband is an ER doc & will eat anything put in front of him. We order in every night or go out when we're not on call. Not sure if I will try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Down here on vacation from San. Diego, this has to be the best pizza I have ever had. Everything about this place is amazing from the Italian severs who are friendly and excellent at what they do to the mouth watering wine, pizza, and dessert! I would highly recommend the margarita pizza!!! The only thing I'm mad about is that we don't have one in San. Diego! Exceeded my expectations, simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Great pizza.  They are very accommodating to food allergies and are gracious about  changing ingredients when asked.  TONY is one of the BEST bartenders in Scottsdale. He's friendly, competent, efficient, and never forgets a face. Always look forward to seeing him when we arrive and KNOW that my special order pizza will be ordered correctly. THANKS TONY!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in town. Their Diavola pizza never disappoints! I also highly recommend the simply prepared, yet delicious faro salad, especially as an appetizer to share. I'm yet to learn where they get their tomatoes from. They're more flavorful than any tomatoes I've tried here. The desserts are equally impressive. My favorite right now is the semifreddo. Also great selection of Italian wines. Very reasonably priced and very consistent. I've never walked out disappointed. I'm get to try their pastas. I'm sure they're equally delicious. They also have a very nice bar area and I love that instead of sports on their TV screen, you see Italian landscapes. Always makes me want to go back to Italy. The little marketplace is also lovely and you can purchase many of the items on the menu. The place is always very busy on weekends, so you may need reservations or opt for a spot at the bar."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, some of our pizzas were slightly undercooked and soggy. Service was slow, but may give this place another chance not on a Christmas weekend."}
{"text":"Guys night out with two buddies who know true Italian pizza and are VIP guests. We sat around the pizza bar oven area and the owner put pizza after pizza in front of us I swear we ate 10 pizzas and everyone was delicious. I'm actually eating a leftover piece for breakfast now :-)   Great experience and friendly staff everyone had smiles and all the cooks speak Italian which adds to the experience."}
{"text":"My friends and I really enjoyed this place. We decided to share so we could try different dishes. The Principe pizza was excellent, perfect crust! The eggplant parmigiana was delicious. The eggplant was grilled perfectly. The strozzapreti was scrumptious, especially the sauce.   We tried the semi freddo and affogatto for dessert. The semi freddo was good. The figs were wonderful. And the coffee was fantastic!  Add to that the great wine list, wonderful service and the atmosphere and it is a place we will go back to for sure."}
{"text":"This is an \"official-authentic\" Italien restaurant, and I frequent it regularly. But it is not just basic - it is gourmet.  My favorite waitress is Marie, and she waited on me today. She should probably be given some sort of award or something as the best waitress I have ever had.   There is LIVE basil hanging on the wall. For real. Just walk up and see for yourself.   The olive oil is unbelievable.   I giant copper covered Pizza oven adds to the environment.   If you care, the salads are all organic. And the optional chicken on the salads is organic raised.   They have both gluten free and regular food.   I have never had anything that was less than \"unbelievably good\" at this restaurant.   On the other side of the restaurant is a small cafe that opens in the morning before the main restaurant. (Cafe is closed Sunday) It is the best expresso machine in Scottsdale, with the owner of the restaurant (sometimes) who actually knows how to make a real expresso or cappuccino. You should understand how rare this is. Note: The express or coffee you get in the main restaurant comes from the same expresso machine.   The pasteries remind me of being back in Italy.   You are not going to find an Italien place like this very often.   *Please take it easy on the wait staff, and please give them positive feedback when you write a review. These folks work hard, and are subject to a lot of reviews online, because this restaurant is growing in popularity.  One night I took my entire staff to eat here, and we were treated like royalty, even though the place was super busy.   Warning:  The one negative thing I would say is that Pomo's destroys the Pizza-eating experience for me when I go to other pizza restaurants. When I try eating what passes for pizza elsewhere, I just think to myself \"this is definitely not Pomo's. ; - )   - Russell Wright"}
{"text":"Make sure to check your bank account after you go here and keep your receipts!! We went here with friends and split the bill. Our receipt shows the split amount, but when we checked our account they charged us the full amount and charged our friends as well. When we called to rectify the mistake they were unhelpful and rude. Still over 2 weeks later they have tried to make it seem like it is our fault and have still not refunded the overcharged amount!! This is nothing, but simple theft so make sure you check your accounts after going here, especially if you are splitting the bill!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Thought I was sitting in a pizzeria in Napoli. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pomo Pizzeria really knows how to make excellent pizza. The crust (order \"extra crispy\") tastes like the one I ate in Naples, and the variety of types is impressive, from the simple Margherita to the more sophisticated Pizza Chef.  The most unique dish is the Focaccia di Recco, which is only made in the homonymous town near the Italian city of Genoa: two paper thin layers of focaccia dough filled with stracchino cheese and high temp baked, this dish is superb. Bravo"}
{"text":"My friend and I met for lunch. There are so many great restaurants in the Valley and I think with some changes there is potential here. Ambiance can be vastly upgraded with the replacement of the huge photo/wallpaper of a back street in the poorer section of Naples. Talk about depressing! With all the possibilities of scenes of la Bella Italia, why choose this one? This in itself certainly does not signal a quality dinning experience. On to the food ....  I ordered the Pollo Salad. The chicken was warm and tender; it was served over mixed field greens with a tasty lemon/oil dressing. I was disappointed that there so few cherry tomatoes and pine nuts. They certainly need to be a bit more generous here. No fresh ground pepper was offered and no bread was served with the meal.  My friend was satisfied with her pasta dish. We ordered espresso. It was warm and served without a lemon peel twist. I did not say anything. It's not the wait staff's fault. The waitress was pleasant and attentive. Is this an Italian restaurant ... or what? Would I return? I am not sure. Everyone deserves a second chance; however, the owner has be at it for quite a while. I am not a big pizza fan - their forte. That being the case, then the restaurant needs to be rated as such. If they are going  to serve meals, then don't skimp on the tomatoes, pine nuts and bread. Per piacere (please) serve the espresso - HOT.   We, of Italian descent, understand good food. Grazie!"}
{"text":"The moment I put the tortelloni in my mouth, I tasted a piece of heaven.  It is so creamy, so delicious! The truffle butter just adds another level of decadence! Our waiter was especially attentive when he found out about a peanut allergy among our table. Excellent service and even better food!  Also ambiance is so romantic!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! I moved from Chicago to Scottsdale and have been super critical of the food out here. I find most of the places out here chains or over priced with poor quality. BUT I am super excited to have found Pomo.   The pizza is as close to eating pizza in Italy as possible. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable. The hostess Kaitlin is lovely to talk to. They are also accommodating for large parties."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Servers are generally helpful but food lacks flavor and the pizzas were not a big hit at our table. But if you're looking for a nice outdoor bar and you're staying nearby then this is a good option."}
{"text":"Obsessed with their Principe pizza as well as the margarita !!! Ambiance is really nice and the servers are fantastic as well.   One of my go-to places in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Yum! First time visiting Pomo. We didn't try the pizza but the pasta, caprese, and mushroom soup were amazing. The vino was great too. Our server was super busy but was still very attentive. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Everything about Pomo was mediocre, including taste of the food, speed of service and the quality of service. We arrived at 9pm on a Friday and didn't get our APPETIZER until 9:40... and the Arancini we ordered came out cold in the middle so we had to send them back. They were okay - warm enough the second time but very bland. When our dishes arrived right after that, my Bolognese was not only underdressed but also COLD. And my boyfriends pizza was covered in oil and was soggy.. not crisp whatsoever (his description: \"wet noodle\"). We scarfed down our food to make it to Luna Gelateria which is housed in the same building and got in line at 10:06... apparently they closed at 10 and even though we were in the same restaurant they would not serve us. Very disappointing. Overall our meal of 3 drinks, an appetizer and two entrees was about $85 not including tip and we thought for the quality of service (no they did not take off the appetizer that took over 30 minutes to come out in a practically empty restaurant off of our bill) and even the taste of the food was not worth it. To be honest, Olive Garden beats Pomo. I recommend Stone and Vine and North over this restaurant any day in every circumstance. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Good looking restaurant, great energy!  Lots of smaller areas with different vibes, several bars and a little store.  Best design work I've seen in a long time. Noise level was reasonable and I'm pretty sensitive to that.  My martini was perfectly made - a dying art. The pizza was excellent - all so fresh!  Delicious crust, perfectly baked.  My wife and I each got our own but could have happily split one.  Star of the night was the tiramisu, recommended by our waitress (who was fantastic BTW). We almost never get dessert and I don't particularly like tiramisu - usually too dry and heavy for me - but we decided to try it.  Wow!  So light!  Put a bite in your mouth and it kind of explodes!  Lots of flavor, not too sweet, just delicious.  We'll be going back next week and this time I may go for dessert first."}
{"text":"No doubt the BEST pizza I have ever had.  We got the Pizza Chef and added fresh garlic.  It was incredible.  We also shared a salad, which was good, but lacked a nut crunch.  The beer selection was good as well.  We tried to go back two nights later with friends for dinner it was so good, but they had a party of 28 that ruined it for everyone."}
{"text":"I like Pomo so much that on a recent visit back to AZ I had to go twice!  I like this location much more than the previous Borgata version, and the delicious pizzas were something I knew I would miss when I moved away.    So...  Pomo was the first dinner spot I chose during my last trip back, and I was looking forward to some great pizza, wine and conversation.  3 people means we should share 3 pizzas, right?  Yes, there were left overs.  Some.  A little.    Principe:  This is by far my favorite.  Pomo's perfect thin crust graced with prosciutto crudo di parma, arugula, and shaved parmigiano reggiano.  I just cannot get enough.  Quattro Formaggi:  What is better than one cheese?  Four!  The fresh basil makes this creation even better.  Bufala Verace:  This is a classic Napoletana preparation, topped with delicious imported Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP, basil and EVOO.  I loved it as well, but wish there were even more of the mozzarella goodness.  A few days later, asked to select a lunch destination, I did not hesitate to suggest Pomo's outside patio.  This time between two people we shared the Principe (I said I can't get enough) as well as a Mista salad (the shaved parmigiano reggiano and balsamic vinegar topping the fresh greens earn this a spot in my heart).  Oh, and the nice chianti that rounded out the leisurely lunch didn't hurt either.  The location is great, and the layout with both indoor and covered patio seating makes it a good choice for an intimate meal or a get together with a larger group.  Can you open one in Orange County?  Please?  Just like you can expect summers in AZ to be hot, you can expect me to be back at Pomo as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Great spot! Inside was GORG with all the marble and the gold pizza oven! It was so pretty. The staff was great, very friendly and welcoming. Our meal was just as good!!! Cheese platter to start was perefct. Then for dinner we ordered a white and red pizza, in addition to pasta! Everything was very authentic Italian, simply made, with care of ingredients.....the result was delicious!!!! Every bite was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Very good food and service every time I've been.  Tonight really blew me away. My in laws had  never been and our waiter really explained the menu in depth . The food is consistently delicious. I love the capriossa (sp?). I didn't care for the drink I ordered so the waiter was nice enough to replace it with something that fit my taste better.  I never had an empty glass or dirty plate in front of me. Every time we go here , we have an awesome experience . For me, the pizza here is much better than Bianco ."}
{"text":"We've had many meals here since Pomo opened a few years ago, but today we were disappointed.  I just wonder when it was they last tasted their own food to ensure the high quality as when they opened.  The gnocchi was not good.  We could not taste any potato in the dish; instead of delicate, light potato \"pillows\", they were mushy cheese balls.  I kept looking for the potato.  The minestrone soup was average. Gone was the lovely garlic and onion undertones of a well made minestrone.  The bruschetta was average--excellent bread, but the tomatoes on top were simply halved instead of diced, and the flavor was lacking.  There was one leaf of basil as a garnish on the plate, but no basil chopped up and added to the tomatoes.  The one shining light was the service.  We had a great waiter who couldn't have been more gracious and courteous.  Also, the coffee was exceptional.  Come on Pomo! Put the Mama Mia back in the food!"}
{"text":"I had heard of Pomo and then saw that it was now in Gainey Village.  I am so happy that I took some time for lunch today.  I was able to sit outside and have a wonderful panini.  I'm embarrassed to say that it probably could have fed 3 people but I almost finished it myself (ok - not too embarrassed).  Everything was so fresh.  I thought the price for the size of the meal was reasonable and will definitely be back.  The market next store has some great Italian oils, glazes, etc. so that will also be another stop!"}
{"text":"Had lunch. Had to ask server for lunch menu with sandwiches as the hostess did not provide it.  Ordered a salad and sandwich and green teas. Server seemed annoyed all lunch. Food was great, server just made us not feel welcome."}
{"text":"Pizza taste like hotdogs, crust was not done, a joke!! The one in chandler is much much better!! Little caesars is much better then this location, according to son!"}
{"text":"Dinner was great, we ordered the Pizza Diavola, outstanding! Our server Amber was fantastic and hilarious, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just average food. Sauce on meatballs was plain. Mista salad was boring with little dressing. Vegetable pizza was fair. Limited and clumped eggplant, zucchini...2 pieces of basil. Really, I just cut 10 cups of basil from my garden. Pizza had boring flavor.  Chef needs to amp up flavor. For example, marinate the grilled vegetables first, then put a good amount on the pizza! Don't skimp. Water has a weird flavor too. I'm sorry Pomo, I'm Italian...lived there for 7 years and I cook.  Just average food, at not average prices. Mista salad was worth $3."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Pomo and I will be returning.  I sat at the outside bar and had a glass of wine while waiting for the rest of my party.  Once they arrived we were promptly seated on the patio which was comfortable despite the heat outside.  Fast attentive service.  We had the pizza (Margherita & Sasa) which were both excellent and 2 salads (Pollo & Caprese) which were also tasty and good sized. Nice atmosphere and relaxed environment."}
{"text":"Went to Pomo for my third time last night with my mom. It was a 45 minute wait for a table on a Saturday night at around 7. Luckily, we found two spots at the outside portion of the bar and although a little warmer than inside, with the misters and fans it was not bad!  We split the Cesar salad and Principe pizza which were both great. They keep their menu simple by not over complicating their dishes with excessive ingredients. Instead, they use fresh a few fresh and high quality ingredients making it great authentic Italian food. I'm not a big fan of sausage or pepperoni on pizzas so the Principe was perfect, being prosciutto, arugula, and Parmesan with a red sauce base. The dough is a perfect balance, it's thin but not crispy, with a substantial crust, but not doughy.   Aside from the food, Pomo has a great open layout and a fun atmosphere. Very happy to have it open in my neighborhood. Will definitely be there again soon!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the valley. You cannot go wrong with any pizza (I probably tried them all!) -   Very consistent service (that is great), phenomenal drinks, and great ambiance. I'd go as far as to say some of the best pizza I've had period. If you are visiting or local - this is a MUST stop."}
{"text":"OH. EM. GEE. This is some delicious Italian food. I came here with coworkers and ate until I could not eat anymore. We ordered a ton of food and everyone got to try a bit of everything. I think the meatballs (which are as big as a softball) may have been my favorite, but it's really hard to say because everything was wonderful. We also had the bruschetta, the Crocchete Pugliesi, salami board, Pizza Margherita, and a lot more. And the service was incredible. I will definitely be coming back here next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and have always had great service and food. I brought my daughters from Prescott last Monday. The hostess and waiter were terrible!  We stood at the front waiting to be seated, after about 5 min a girl sitting at a table that I had made eye contact several times, sat us.  Our waiter was great when we first ordered but also did not write down our order. When the order arrived it was not correct, I let him know and was told that I had made the mistake, not him.  He was angry and rude while telling me that even though I made the mistake, he would \"buy\" it for me.  It took over an hour for our pasta dish to arrive after asking him about it, which he had obviously never put in.  I was considering talking to a manager because it was not only embarrassing but disappointing  and as a business owner myself, I would want to know.  Unfortunately who ever was in charge was too busy screaming at a cook and throwing a utensil.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful and enjoyabe evening dining on a thin crust, charred pomo pizza. The sauce was authentic Italian. Get beat a night in Scottsdale at Pomos.. especially with a glass of Super Tuscan. EJ was our server, and he was very attentive to our dining needs."}
{"text":"Good pizza? Yes.  Best pizza I've had? No.  All the pizzas at Pomo are thin crust...not a problem for me so long as they hold up all the toppings which, unfortunately it doesn't at Pomo's. But then again, maybe that has to do with how the pieces are cut...all 3 of our pizzas were cut awkwardly. 1 in off-centered quarters...leaving 2 GIANT pieces and 2 tiny ones. 1 into sixths....where 2 were extremely thin and 2 were extremely fat...but at least 2 looked normal. 1 into, can you  believe it, fifths. where 1 was a triangle and 4 were trapezoids of some sort.   Oh, and toppings are not spread evenly...take for example our vegetarian pizza with roasted veggies. It's straight from the menu, but this is how it was delivered. Half eggplant, half zucchini....and a PILE of bell peppers in the middle.   It was good once we spread it around and traded veggies....but come on. This was a common theme for all our pizzas...  Meh.  This place came highly recommended...and thus with high expectations...which, unfortunately, were not met."}
{"text":"For a West coast desert town, Phoenix seems to have a large number of really great pizzerias. Pomo is no exception.   My boyfriend and I visited Pomo on a Friday night. We snagged a table on their huge covered patio and settled in. Our server was very attentive, even trying to light our candle again and again every time the wind blew it out.  We ordered the kale salad (which is a version of a Caesar but with kale) and the peppino pizza. The salad was a perfect portion for two people to share. Lots of croutons and fresh parmesan and not too much dressing. It had a good flavor and the addition of kale gave it a heartier texture.   The pizza was delicious. Lots of flavor, the crust was cooked perfectly and just the right amount of cheese. Again, it was a nice size portion for two people to share.  For dessert we chose the cream puffs. They come three to an order and are covered in a yummy, fudgy chocolate. Needless to say, there was not a crumb left on the plate.   Officially adding Pomo to our list of pizza places to visit again!"}
{"text":"The best in the valley!  My husband is a Jersey Italian so pizza is near and dear to his heart. He won't eat anywhere else"}
{"text":"After many recommendations to try this restaurant we had a very disappointing experience. Although I wish that we could review the food, after 15 minutes at the bar we were only given water and no menus. The bartender was clearly under the weather and said so much. Not our problem. Good luck if you venture in for a Sunday lunch."}
{"text":"Fun restaurant to go with a group. We shared a couple salads and a couple pizzas and everything was great. Loved the all Italian wine list. Good choices- reasonable prices. Sat at the outside bar in the dead of summer while we were waiting for our group to arrive and the masters made it extremely comfortable."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Arizona. HA! We liked it so much, we were afraid of over-selling it to the family. Needn't have worried -- they love it too!"}
{"text":"After a recommendation from a client I was immediately begging my boyfriend to take me. The restaurant is to die for, definitely a hidden gem. Everything is imported from Italy. And get this! The crust is the best part, the crust is NEVER the best part. Seriously. To die for. Go!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed after hearing how incredible it's supposed to be. Very bland and too soggy."}
{"text":"Pizza here is pretty good. My main issue is the service and atmosphere. The hostesses were beyond rude and snotty. The tables are also too close together. I felt like uncomfortable having a conversation with my boyfriend because we were so close to other people. I literally had to turn sideways to get into the booth side. Place is a little too trendy for my style."}
{"text":"Obsessed! I am so happy we discovered this gem at the Italian Festival in Old Town a few months ago. After enjoying the pizza there, we recently visited the Scottsdale location with a large group and had a wonderful experience. The large outdoor patio is the perfect place to sit if the weather is nice, and the pizza is absolutely to die for. We tried 7 different pizzas and each one was amazing. Great service made the experience even better. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ok - So I gave this spot two chances to redeem themselves but both times service was crappy, honestly if not utterly horrible. But the one thing that they do right is Pizza! I ordered the Principe - Prosciutto Crudo San Daniele DOP, Fresh Arugula Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano and it was insanely good! The not so good was their Siciliana Salad which featured Sicilian Tuna, Organic Spring Mix, Grape Tomato Cherry Mozzarella, Evoo. It really lacked any real flavor and for $12.00 not worth ordering. Drink menu here is great - they have their own version of a Moscow Mule, which frankly I enjoy more than the traditional mule.  It's a great addition to the neighborhood but I wish the service was better!"}
{"text":"The pizza is really excellent. Top notch Italian ingredients and fantastic sauce. Thin crust but not burnt, with a chewy rather than crispy texture. We really, really love the pizza here. Good selection of beer and Italian wine.  The quality of the pizza allows us to overlook the inconsistent service and entirely indifferent host staff. If you want to have good pizza in a place that seems to barely tolerate you, this is the spot. It is really strange, as we were regular customers at the previous location at the Borgata and we have been to the downtown location a number of times, and never had any issue with service or staff at either of those places. It's kind of like they decided since they were in a slightly ritzier area they'd get an attitude to match. still: go for the pizza.  UPDATE: within a day of submitting this review, Pomo management contacted me to ask about the experience and why I felt the host/service was not up to par. I let them know my thoughts and they can address it however they please. I was glad to see that Pomo responds professionally and will accept constructive criticism, which is the sign of a place that will succeed. Again, the pizza is excellent, and if they address some of the issues I raised I'd gladly give this place five stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drink, and I can't even say enough about the friendly welcome and excellent service.   You walk into a Scottsdale restaurant or bar in season and, in some cases, you get a face full of attitude and sour grapes. Not at Pomo. You walk in and you're greeted by friendly, sweet faces, who seem genuinely pleased to welcome you. What a wonderful change! We walked into a few restaurants tonight and just couldn't handle the 'tude. We walked into Pomo and those girls were just awesome!!!  We stayed longer than we planned, and ate and drank more than we intended. And I say it was 100% due to the warm atmosphere and kind greetings.   Thank goodness we have options like Pomo that serve the good food, make the awesome drinks, and demonstrate what service with a (real) smile feels like. Cheers to you, Pomo, and I raise a glass to your awesome staff. Especially the ladies at the hostess station. That's the way to do service with a smile!"}
{"text":"searched for VPN pizza places and found this place. We showed up at 5pm on Thursday and said they had no openings and we had to have a reservation but they squeezed us in right away.  The bread and oil/vinaigrette is really really good and we asked for more since we had 5 of us and they charged us $2 more. never heard of that. wow!  We ordered 2 pizzas. One was a specialty pizza with mushrooms and it didn't have red sauce and the other was not a specialty pizza and it had red sauce. We didn't like the specialty pizza and the mushrooms where real soggy and mushy and it was kind of gross. The regular pizza with the red sauce was pretty good but the pizza it self was really soggy and I hate that when my pizza is soggy.  I would maybe try it again because hopefully the pizza wouldn't be soggy next time and it would have to be with red sauce. id rate it 2.5 stars but since I cant I will give it 3 since they squeezed us in."}
{"text":"I love pizza and I am always trying out new pizza spots. This spot is very nice but was a little disappointed with the small bar areas. I wanted to sit at the main bar so I can watch the game. The bar was full and there was no seats. They had another area with a bar and it had a television, but can only receive one channel per the waitress. No wonder no one was in that area. Place definitely had a good vibe and ambience was good! Now the pizza I ordered came out in 5 minutes and it was very delicious. Pizza is wood fried and the crust was very crispy! Not bad for $15. The waitress and staff was very friendly! I will come back for this amazing pizza they serve again in the future!"}
{"text":"I really want to give this place 5 stars. I've been there twice, and each time all the food was phenomenal besides one pizza. And that pizza has been really not well-made. This most recent time was the margarita pizza. Otherwise, the pizzas have been delicious, and the salads are great as well. Typical west-coast style thin pizzas. I'd definitely still recommend this place, it's just been a bit less than perfect when I've been."}
{"text":"I've spent quite a bit of time in Italy so when someone says to me \"hey let's go have Italian\", I tend to set myself up for a mediocre dining experience.  This place?  I was pleasantly surprised!!     It's situated in a fancier strip mall, but a strip mall nonetheless.  (man does the valley love a mall). don't be deterred.    With indoor dining and a large gorgeous patio, there is ample seating. I recommend reservations as it was packed on a Friday night.  However we had a lovely time chatting in the attached market/mozzarella bar. We learned that they import Italian foods and beverages  and most of the ingredients as well. Sure enough I saw tons of drinks, canned cherry tomatoes (the BEST), cheeses, cookies, you name it.    The service was excellent and attentive.  Our server really pared down the extensive menu for us and offered great suggestions.    The wine list is 100% Italian wines, of course, and offers a variety of wines in varying price points.   We opted for a pizza.  Absolutely delicious.  We ordered the pizza with fresh shaved parm, prosciutto, and arugula. While the arugula on top made it hard to pick up and eat, it was outstanding nonetheless. I was informed that the pizza oven was shipped from Italy as well.  It tasted like it did in Naples to me!!  We also split the bufalita salad.  ARgula, cherry tomatoes, olive oil, and fresh bufalata.  simple, yet delicious.   I cannot wait to go back and visit this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by this dining experience! The evening started out on the patio which was well heated. The greeter sat us at stable for two next the door, which seemed perfectly lovely until servers began to utilize the door. It was constant slamming, as the door had no stopper. We asked if we could move as it felt like the glass window might shatter on us at any moment. They happily moved us in doors. You could still hear the constant slamming of the door but the possibility of shattered  glass was no longer a concern. We ordered the trio bruschetta to start. Although the presentation was lovely the dish lacked flavor. Then we had the kale and Roma salad which again was bland and had no flavor. Finally we ended the experience with a white pizza with sausage and mushroom, which sadly had very little flavor. Also the mushrooms appeared to be canned mushrooms and we're not fresh or high quality. The only saving grace of his experience was the wine. I would not recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"stopped here for lunch today. excellent service. the waiter was sure to explain the difference of Neo...alyssamilanotan...politan...you know what i'm sayin', type pizza. I already know, we have a spot in my neighborhood, but it's probably a good thing they explain for those who might not know, so you know what to expect - and at Pomo you can expect excellence.  and to add to the authenticity many Italian accents.  *kisses joined fingertips, explodes hand bomb*"}
{"text":"I have lived in Scottsdale for years coming from New Jersey and finally found real authentic fresh Italian food. The staff was all fantastic and friendly. A true Italian experience. I felt like I was in my Italian uncle kitchen between the staff enthusiastically speaking to one another to the owners strive for perfection. Everything we tried including the Italian wines were PERFECT. And my kids enjoyed the bear ice Cream. A true diamond amongst the rough in Italian dining in Scottsdale. Try the prosciutto, YUM."}
{"text":"Had a great night at the patio bar. The bartender was very pleasant and knowledgeable about gluten allergies which made my wife very happy.  The layout is great and the food was ben better. Very interesting space with a very clean and open kitchen.  I highly recommend it for a casual night out."}
{"text":"We liked this place so much that we ate here our first and last night in town. Our first night we started out with appetizers-the polpette meatballs-creekstone natural beef, pork, tomato sauce and parmigiano and the arincini Sicilian-saffron rice balls filled with meat sauce, mozzarella and sweet peas. Yum! We split the Kale-Romana organic salad with shaved parmigiano, homemade croutons, and the house dressing. Then we split 3 entrees among the 3 of us-the strozzapreti salsiccia-an incredible pasta with Italian sausage, tomato sauce, cream, rosemary and parmigiano cheese, the lasagna al forno with Bolognese meat sauce, besciamel and parmigiano, and the Spaccatelle Carbonara-pasta with pancetta, cream, organic egg yolk pecorino Romano. Everything was over the top delicious. Their pasta is hand crafted in-house daily with imported Italian semolina flour. They also have gluten free pasta available-brown rice pasta.  They have pizzas too and even offer gluten free pizzas.  Our last night in town we got our order to go.  Everyone there was super friendly and attentive. Great atmosphere. We even got a gift card for our friends that come to Scottsdale often. Our favorite place to eat on our trip!"}
{"text":"This Pomo was in the posh Gainey Mall. We had 30 minutes for a quick hit before our other dinner date and boy were they accommodating. We got our 2 pies and Diet Cokes in about 15 minutes and they were very good but not as good as Great Lake in Chicago."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to go somewhere NEW for date night. As foodies, that can be difficult sometimes. After reading the reviews, I decided on Pomo. Pomo was fabulous (tons of locally grown and organic options)! We felt welcome from the moment we stepped into the door until the moment we left. Hospitable staff and incredible food. I am pretty picky when it comes to gluten-free pizza, and this has to be some of the best that I have had. My husband had the HUGE calzone and was in heaven...yes, he ate the whole thing. We ended the night with creme brûlée! Everything was just perfect, the way date night should always be. I highly recommend sitting in the heated patio area, as the ambiance was just right for a romantic evening. If you see the reviews (like I did before I came), trust them. Pomo will not let you down! We are already planning our trip back."}
{"text":"I have passed Pomo Pizzeria a million times and have always wondered how it was! The verdict: it was really good! Very fresh, tasty, and complete with a true Italian feel. We sat on their adorable patio, and had the most perfect sunset view. The service here was great, which made it an optimal choice for a family dinner. I split a margarita pizza and the gnocchi with marinara sauce with my father. They even had a vegan pizza for my brother! All and all, we really enjoyed everything and can't wait to come back and try some of the other menu items that they offer! Thank you, Pomo Pizzeria for a great experience."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have head in US !  Whenever I go to Phoenix I have to have their pizza.  Last time I had something this good was jn Naples !"}
{"text":"My domestic partner and I had a nice date night here on a Wednesday night. The food was a little overpriced in my opinion (lasagna for $18 and two little croquettes for $9) but everything is prepared daily with fresh ingredients! I think the most bang for your buck is the fried calzone.  Be aware: They keep the misters on the patio on until someone taps out and asks the manager so don't by shy."}
{"text":"Their pizza just claimed my favorite wood fire spot in Arizona!  I love the imported Italian ingredients. You can taste the difference!!  The cocktails and wine were fabulous and the outside dining/bar will be my better weather happy hour enjoyment.  Even at 100 degrees outside the bar and dining were cranking.  The location also offers imported infused oils that are beyond amazing and worth every penny to create tasty Italy inspired dishes in your own kitchen. The only negative I have is the pasta wasn't anything out of this world. I'd like to see them take the pasta up a notch. . . Good however not great.  #1 wood iron pizza yet!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to take the kids! Fantastic food and outstanding service. I love when I can get real anchovies on a pizza!"}
{"text":"Nothing negative about this place. The food is amazing. We had apps, two different salads, two different pizzas and dessert. All of it was delicious!! The staff was just as good. Knowledgable of the menu and made great recommendations for wine and kid friendly modifications to the pizza. Hands down we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  We arrived without reservations with 3 kids, and despite Thera t they were very busy, the hostesses did a great job of working us in within 10 minutes.  Atmosphere is cool, a little bit of a modern twist but comfortable at the same time.  Food was tremendous, the salad very fresh and dressing was great.  Pizza was great, thin crisp crust with just enough chewiness, sauce was delicious and ingredients were clearly fresh.  The pasta special was really good too.  Desert choices were the perfect finishing touch."}
{"text":"amazing atmosphere and great food.my client recommended this place to me. we had the POMO pizza and bruschetta as an appetizer.yummy"}
{"text":"We were so hoping this would be a five star experience. Close, but not quite. Honestly, it was our daughter's spaghetti marinara that took the rating to four stars. It was flavorful and the pasta was cooked beautifully. Over cooked pasta is unforgivable, in my book. Our pizza needed another 3-4 minutes cooking to make the crust less soggy and to avoid the cold middle we experienced. The flavor was good, for sure. It just could have been executed better. I will say that we did not have reservations so the hostess was going to either seat us outside or at the pizza bar and the manager (I'm guessing) found a table for us in the dining room. With our three year old, I especially appreciated the extra effort. We would eat here again."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere but disappointed in the food..wish we would have gone to Whole Foods deli!"}
{"text":"Red wine served too hot. They have a sommelier who put together a very generic list and then has no proper wine storage so red wines sit outside at Scottsdale \"room temperature\", not 57-61 degrees. Most of the wines appeal to demographics who can readily recognize the labels from Costco. You don't need a somm for this. We ended up drinking the beer on tap. Eh...good luck."}
{"text":"The focaccia di Recco may be one of the absolute best offerings at Pomo!!! In fact, I'd give a 10 for culinary artistry, taste, and deliciousness. I never ate anything better in the 15 times I've been to Italy!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's happened since their move but I'm not returning.  Food was good once we got it.  Because of an hour wait for a table, we sat at the bar which usually ensures good service.  We had to ask to place our order, ask for a glass of water, ask for our food after a 45 minute wait, ask for parmesan, ask for another Coke, ask for the bill.  Yes the food was good, but I'm sorry...service is also part of the experience.  Judging by an overheard conversation between the mgr and a customer, ours wasn't the only bad experience of the night.  Since I wrote the above review, I was contacted by the restaurant .  They apologized, assured me they try hard to train staff, and invited us back to try them again.  We will probably do so but will wait until a less crowded time of year."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and ordered a shaken martini and their Tortelloni pasta.... SO good.   Bar tenders were high energy and seemed to love their job!  I would love to go back and try other dishes."}
{"text":"I'm perplexed. I know people who love this place. It's up for winning the Business Journal pizza-off (or whatever they call it). I've eaten here three times. The first time my wife and I left thinking, what's the big deal?  The second time I thought, not bad. And the third time we left and again asked, what is it that people see in this place. The pizza is ordinary. The place is very loud. It's crowded. Don't get me wrong, I lover Neapolitan pizza, and there is much better pizza around than this in Phoenix. About the pizza. They do pretty well with the crust, although it's probably a little short on salt. The sauce is bland, as is the sausage. Together that adds up to a pretty boring pizza. I will admit that if you get one with salami, it covers us the deficiency in the sauce. Anyway, this restaurant now falls into the category of 'I won't go there as a destination, but if I'm driving by and am starving, I may stop in.' That's not an elite group."}
{"text":"I am so glad this restaurant reopened.  This version is even better if you can believe it.  Looks very modern sleek/sexy.  Open air bar is amazing.    Food is as amazing as ever.....so consistent......  Look forward to trying some of the new menu items although on my first visit went back to my old faithful.....  Diavola!!!!!!  (Spicy Pepperoni) for the novice.....    Although the market was not yet open, it too looks very inviting.  Can't wait to try it.  POMO ..... Welcome Back."}
{"text":"Pomo! This is my spot right here. Lisa and I love going here. Their pizza is on point. I think they have the best non-Chicago style pizza in Arizona. Forget Pizzeria Bianco. This place is the best. Trust me. Pomo is very spacious. Their ingredients are the best I have had in Arizona. The staff is very friendly and the service is always impeccable.  They have a store there which sells olive oil and balsamic which if you know me is my fav. I would like to think I am an aficionado when it comes those. If you order bread you get to try their olive oil and balsamic that they sell there. It is the best I have ever had.  Their dessert is amazing as well. Their bread pudding is top notch.  I have tried various food items here and they are all good. They have a nice patio as well.  Pomo is a good date spot. I can hardly wait for them to open the new location in Gilbert.  Check Pomo out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Simply put: TO DIE 4 Certified Neapolitan Pizzas!!! Thats right, these guys have the equivalency of a Doctorate in pizza making. This is last meal pizza for me...seriously. My wife always makes fun of me for it. Oh well - I love it.  The \"Bufala Verace\" may just be some of the finest pizza to ever grace my tastebuds lol....getting hungry thinking about it.   Wonderful menu - excellent bar and espressos - great ambiance and superior service. We love U POMO. And we will keep coming back as long as you are here."}
{"text":"Very trendy place. Very busy.  Nice big covered patio which is very well heated even on a cold, rainy night. Great pizza. Lots of Italian market items for purchase, i.e. cookies, olive oil, pasta.  TVs at bar. Lots of seating. In cool little shopping area."}
{"text":"Pomo serves some of the best Italian food I've been served outside Italy, and the only other places that even came close were in NYC. Truth be told, I don't think I ever had the equal of Pomo's deep-fried calzone even there. It's all about the food, but the airy modern interior is easy on the eye, the patio pleasant, and the servers professional and friendly without overdoing it. I prefer the pizza here to the deservedly touted Bianco, which many people think is one of the top pizzerias in the country. We had a delightful Valentine's Day celebration at Pomo and have been returning regularly ever since."}
{"text":"Very very good thin crust pizza cooked in a real italian brick oven. Super fast from order to on your plate as they cook at 900+ degrees. The bar is a great p;lace to enjoy a good IPA and share a pizza. Good bike parking and we stopped mid ride to try the place. They have an Italian market attached which sells many flavored oils and pastas. Do try this place you will like it!"}
{"text":"The food here was superb.   We ordered enough for at least 4 people and I ate almost all of it.  Everything we ordered was amazing.   We got a couple appetizers,  a salad and 2 pizzas.    Unfortunately our server was horrible.   Our drinks we always empty, we didn't get drinks until after at least 10 minutes after being seated and a different server asked if we had been helped yet.  Luckily the other guy watched out for us the whole time.  He constantly filled our drinks and took away an armful of empty dishes from our table.  It appeared that we had the only inadequate server there as everyone else seemed very attentive.     After dinner we walked over to the market and we're able to learn a ton about olive processing and olive oils.   It was really interesting how much knowledge these guys have and the passion for food is exciting.   We had our dessert on that side giving us a chance to walk around a bit after dinner.  Dessert was fantastic too.  I don't remember what it was but it was frozen and had bits of fig and nuts with a crumbled crust like surface strawberries and caramel drizzle.   They also have a vintage Vespa to take pictures on in front of the restaurant.   Fun place with great food!  We will be telling everyone we know to try it and we will be back.    Some nice live, authentic Italian music would really add a nice touch to the place."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Came at the recommendation of my cousin who lives nearby, so glad we visited! Service was awesome, pizza was amazing."}
{"text":"Just like the original location, this cannot be beat. simply great pizza!"}
{"text":"Overall recommendations: highly recommend.   Food: the food is great. We regularly get the pomo pizza. You can taste the quality ingredients and watch them make it in the middle of the restaurant. The wood burning oven itself is beautiful. They make their own dough fresh. They are part of the Verace Pizza Napoletana and Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani so you know it's legit Italian pizza. (Look it up to confirm). So the standard of quality is there.  Try the lasagna. We get it every time. Pasta is cooked well. Great sauce and meat.  For dessert, tiramisu is highly recommended if you have any space left. It is light. Not too sweet.   Service: the servers, pizza makers, and manager are very personable. Each person comes to ensure that the food comes in a timely manner and that you are enjoying the food. It shows they care about their food and service.   Parking: private lot that has valet available during certain times. It can get busy on weekends or events.   Ambience and environment: clean, busy, darker lighting. You have different seating options: table indoor, table outdoor, bar, and pizza bar (near pizza makers). No poor options. Bathroom is clean too."}
{"text":"Asked for glass of best red bargirl ran out of one bottle.a.i asked that new bottle not be mixed. Oh dont worry other bottle was fresh.  Fundamental lack of understanding that you do not mix different bottles of wine. Shame always liked this place."}
{"text":"It's fine for the food. Bad for the service. Waited 40 minutes for a to go order for them to find out it's been sitting there. Also didn't offer to remake it.   The owner emailed, apologized, and offered to make it up to me in the future, which is nice, but doesn't change what happened and that's the point of a review.  If it is better in the future I'd post another review that is positive.  Also super annoyed that they complained to Yelp who then removed the review.  Let's see if this one sticks!"}
{"text":"The new location is modern, trendy, and a fun environment.  The patio area is gorgeous too.  The pizza remains the same, absolutely delicious.  The pizza has an amazing thin, crispy yet chewy crust.  The ingredients tasted very fresh and high quality.  They also have a great selection of drinks, alcoholic and non.   All in all, this is a reasonably priced, delicious Italian kitchen."}
{"text":"I kind of accidentally went here a few weekend ago when we had originally tried to go to the crepe place in Gainey Ranch. However, they were crowded and I had remembered seeing Pomo on a Yelp search and seeing that they had great reviews. Therefore, we decided to walk across the parking lot for some pizza instead for lunch.  We were seated right away and since it was our first time there, we were told about their background and how they're the only place in the US that's certified for having authentic Napoleon style pizza (or something like that). We ordered the margharita pizza and gnocci. We were warned that the wait would be a little longer due to the gnocci.  The wait was definitely long, but worth it. The pizza was great. Lots of flavor with fresh ingredients. The gnocci was room temperature when we got it which was disappointing. It was really good though, just would have been better if it was hot. It did make for great leftovers though.   I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I visit Scottsdale a few times a year and I always make time to stop in to Pomo for a bite to eat while I'm there.  The new location is really convenient and easy to find; and the service and ambiance are classy without being pretentious.  The food is consistently fabulous.  My favorite is the Napoli pizza- with just the right amount of anchovies!   Can't wait to go back in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"We went in for the food, we stayed for the music!  We were in town for Spring Training baseball.  Went to a game at Salt River then spent the afternoon exploring shops in Scottsdale.  We Yelped to find a place to eat, and Italian was it.  It was a Friday during lent so we opted for the Margherita pizza and Gnocchi.  DELISH!  Both were so yummy.  Our waiter was so attentive, and we sat on the patio where we were enjoying the ambiance and music so much we stayed for another glass of wine just to enjoy the music.  We took Tiramisu to go for a late night snack at our hotel (OMG was it good).  We will put this on our \"must visit\" for next years trip."}
{"text":"Five stars is explained as \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" and there's basically no other way I can explain Pomo.  Pomo has been on our radar for a while; we were heartbroken when we tried to visit the downtown location and they were in that weird \"closed for the afternoon\" timeframe. (Don't feel bad for us, we ate at Cibo as a consolation.) I heard that they \"reopened\" their Scottsdale location in this space and we've been on a mission to get here ASAP!  Apparently everyone else has as well. We arrived around 4:30 on Friday for a \"woohoo we both got off work early\" celebraish and our only options were to sit outside (a little chilly for that, even by the beautiful fire/heaters. Yes, I'm a wimp.) or one of what I could see only two tables inside that didn't already have a \"Reserved\" sign.  Our server was Marie and she swooped right over, even though we came in the weird \"in-between-meals-time\" and the front of the house team was clearly having their line-up/pump-up schpeel. She told us about how the massive pizza oven (looked like it was covered in gilded pennies!) and it's owner were imported straight from Italy, recommended some of her favorites, and left us to peruse the menu.  We went with two of her recs: the Romano salad, Pomo's take on the classic Caesar. The dressing is veg-friendly and doesn't include anchovies, but is light and lemony and refreshing. Topped with perfectly crunch croutons and piles of freshly-shaved parm, this was definitely big enough for two to split as an appetizer. I also went with the Regina Margherita, a FRESH take on the classic. The fior di latte, the San Marzanos, the fresh basil...it was everything. My boyfriend went with the Pomo, which had Italian sausage, red bells, sauteed mushrooms and onions. Both pizzas were perfectly wood-fired, and the chili oil offered to drizzle over the top was DIE-vine!!! We were both stuffed after two pieces but both made ourselves eat a third!  Overall--a perfect addition to the hood. So glad it's close so we can visit again and again!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal for pizza. They do authentic Naples pizza, cooked in 90 seconds in there wood burning oven. The drinks are good and try a mule, you will be happy you did. They have a cute outside patio and inside you can buy oils,olives,dips, etc at the little area inside. The pizzas are not large and personal pizza size, so don't think you'll get a large pizza. This is a good place for pizza/drinks and to relax."}
{"text":"The gluten free pizza was perfection!   Don't change the recipe.  It works now.  Marie our server was so helpful and pleasant!  She suggested a Lambrusco wine that was perfect.  Thank you Marie!    Lasagna was great too."}
{"text":"I wake up thinking about pizza and I dream of pizza all day.  Pomo has mastered authentic Italian pizza making.  The atmosphere and the service is on point.    We always order the Kale Romana salad and the Diavola Pizza.  They're so good that it's hard to order anything else from the menu.  A side of the picante olive oil to eat your crust just puts the cherry on top.  You won't find another place like this.  Pomo is one of a kind and I'm glad they now have multiple locations throughout the valley."}
{"text":"Great place if you're looking for some neapolitan pizza. Food was great. I highly recommend the caprese- incredible!  One downside was the service. My mom and I got crammed into a small table towards the back of the patio. Our waiter also left for long periods of time and didn't check on us. Otherwise, it was great."}
{"text":"Glad my son found this place on our last night in town and it would've been a mistake to miss it, very lively upbeat vibe even for Scottsdale. I had the NAPOLI Pizza, very simple fresh local ingredients, sauce was perfect and the crust done just right, I would've given this pizza a perfect 5 BUT I'm an anchovy fan that's why I ordered this particular pie and I think there were maybe one fillet on each piece, they were very tasty just like the rest of the pie, just not enough so mine gets a 4, #2 son orders the POMO Pizza which I have to say was perfect, surprised he let me have a slice it was so good! #1 Son ordered TAGLIOLINI AL SALMONE, an Alaskan Salmon in  cream sauce with homemade pasta and it was awfully tasty, a well done dish with hints of saffron and lots of flavor. All in all a great evening out with my boys made even better by our lovely hostess and our great waiter Denny. Will definitely be back the next time in town. *****"}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere, reasonable prices and delicious pizza! What's not to like?   The authentic, Italian style pizza is fantastic - it's thin crust with a light, chewy texture. They use lots of fresh, organic ingredients and pizzas are cooked in the restaurant's centerpiece - a giant wood fired oven.   I've been here a handful of times - my favorite salad is the Pollo - an organic spring mix with avocado, organic grilled chicken, pine nuts, grape tomatoes, and vinaigrette.   I usually get the salad or a pizza - my favorite (so far) is the Principe - this is one of their classic pizzas that has prosciutto, arugula, and shaved parmesan cheese. I've heard the panini's are great too - they're huge! You won't leave hungry.   If you visit on a weekend night, make a reservation or be prepared for a long wait!"}
{"text":"Whenever we have company, we always take them to Pomo, and they always rave about how wonderful it is! It is a great place to go with a group. Our kids love it, too, and always ask to go there. They have great appetizers. We love the meatballs, caprese, and bruschetta. We have had most of the pasta dishes, and loved them all. We especially like the strozzapreti and the carbonara. Salads are good, and the pizza is all fantastic. Save room for dessert here! The panna cotta, torta nutella, and profitterol are all yummy. They have added gelato, and it is absolutely delicious. We have never had anyone leave there with a less than stellar review. In fact, my friends that just visited for a three day weekend insisted on going back for more gelato before they had to leave and go back home."}
{"text":"Outstanding Neapolitan pizza again! So fresh and authentic. Every ingredient is packed with flavor with the perfect ratio of sauce and cheese..my fave!  Beautiful patio seating and fabulous service."}
{"text":"How is Pomo not rated 4 stars? Seriously the BEST pizza I've ever had (and I've traveled all over the world.Yes, even Italy). It has ruined pizza for me because anything other than Pomo Pizza is just sad and not worth it. The dough is amazing and their fresh mozzarella melts in your mouth. Since moving back home to California, I tell everyone who passes through Phx to go to Pomo and I always stop by when I come through town. Everyone rants and raves about Pizzeria Bianco, but nothing compares to Pomo. Make sure you go to the scottsdale locations, the other locations while good, don't compare to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We took the family (party of 4) to Pomo at 5 pm to enjoy neighborhood pizza.  Unfortunately the visit rapidly went downhill when the hostess could not seat us with 6 tables open.  Literally the restaurant was empty and wide open.  Our option was a seat outside, in July.  Or we could sit our kids at the bar.  We just elected to go Grimaldies where we had a wonderful time in DC ranch.  It is sad when an attitude and a specter of insolence brings down a restaurant.  Hey maybe we need to make reservations at our local pizza place.  Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, wonderful service, and food to die for! Everything we had was delicious! Drinks, salads pizza, lasagna, cappuccinos, and desserts were all expertly crafted and delicious! We decided to have our rehearsal dinner here before our wedding we loved it so much!"}
{"text":"Pomo is a slightly upscale pizza-pasta-salad place, modern looking (which often means loud as it does here) and with good service and fair prices.  But the food is average. In fact, even for average food, its average.  The big problem here is the flavor profiles, which are nearly non-existent.  Neither the pizza nor the pasta tasted like much of anything, and the pasta was overly glutenous.  The panna cotta for dessert had the consistency of rubber, but at least it did have flavor.  We didn't hate the food, but we certainly didn't love it.  I left feeling like \"why did I waste my time, money, and calories?\"."}
{"text":"Reasonable food horrible attitude Everything 1-5 Food 3. Parking 3 Service 2 Atmosphere 2 Value 3  Overall 3 but the service just made the experience worst than it should have been- the room was also cold"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night and got the Strozzapreti alla Salsiccia pasta. My go to dish here, it's delicious every time. Great pasta is hard to find in my opinion, sure you can get a pasta dish most places but it's usually only ok or good. The sausage and cream sauce with the perfectly cooked strozzapreti makes this dish excellent, if not perfect. I have also had their pizza on several occasions and that has been hit or miss to me. I definitely want to come back and try their pizza again."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from an Italian friend-- he told me it was the most authentic Italian pizza in the United States.  It did not disappoint.  I was in town for business and ended up going to both the Scottsdale and Phoenix locations during my stay-- The food was outstanding at both.  I felt the ambiance was far better at Scottsdale, but was blown away by how good the service was in Phoenix.  Both great experiences-- it will be a staple every time I am back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This a great place to go for pizza and drinks. Everything on the menu is excellent. They also have a great happy hour and I love that Tito's is the well vodka. The eggplant Parmesan is my favorite dish. Service is top notch!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Absolutely authentic and delicious pizza! This is the real deal.  Great service, superb ambience. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We loved everything about this place. The service was excellent the food was delicious and the desserts were outstanding. You will really enjoy the thin crust chewy pizza that comes in many different varieties and you can choose your own ingredients.  They have a really good wine list. and have beers on tap. We were not rushed and were able to enjoy our meal in a very spacious patio outside.  I highly recommend you come and try it out. You'll be back again if you do."}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking forward to trying out the location in Scottsdale. The decor is nice, but we were there at the height of dinner time, which made it extremely noisy inside or out on the patio. We both got our own pizzas that were from their daily special menu. My husband's was a meat based pizza with red sauce and mine was vegetable based with red sauce. Both of the pizzas were just ok. We both thought the sauce and seasonings were very bland. We both don't anticipate returning in the future."}
{"text":"Such a well ran place. Pleasure to dine here and they have of course have great pasta, pizza, and lots of wine selections."}
{"text":"I'm gluten free and the pizza was as hard as rock! I ended up just eating the cheese and toppings. If you want the best gf pizza hit up picazzo's. Also, we were sitting at one of the fire pit tables for an hour drinking & ordering apps and no one said anything to us until we ordered our food. Then our waitress told us that the tables were reserved and the people who reserved it were here so we had to move. It was really weird. I worked in the restaurant/hospitality business for years and I would have expected a manager to come over and apologize and tell us that it was their fault that there was no reserved tag on the table but it put us and the waitress in an awkward position. The restaurant was full so we had to wait until 2 chairs opened next to each other. A customer offered to move so my friend and I could sit next to each other and we ended up buying him a drink. The manager should have been around to help and make the transition so we didn't feel bad. I won't go back because of these 2 things."}
{"text":"Tried the Calzone Napoletano so good definitively recommend! We were worried about the \"Spicy Salome\" but it wasn't that spicy at all."}
{"text":"Unfiltered water, burnt pizza not baked with oregano as requested, onion in salad when requested without, horrible experience."}
{"text":"This is based on one experience...I had the bruschetta and a beer. Came here with a bunch of co-workers. Some of us LOVED it, some of us not so much. I thought the bruschetta was good, but I feel it needed a little more umph. Perhaps the pizza and pasta is different? Aside from the eats, mood is romantic and light hearted, the staff is attentive and deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"I like Pomo because it's casual, close to my home, the food is really good, and it's a lively atmosphere. It's a neighborhood restaurant.   I feel comfy sitting at the bar by myself (not a pick up joint), or in the dining room. I recently brought my friend Nancy here for her birthday because she loves the minestrone soup and the eggplant parm. That is her standard order for Pomo. I don't know why I've never tried either because they both look really good - the minestrone is full of chunky veggies. It looks very savory.  I always order the Strozzapreti (not sure if I spelled that correctly.) This dish is alll about comfort food. I really don't like eating pig, but this dish is made with ground sausage. But it doesn't taste like sausage!  It tastes more like ground beef because I don't taste heavy seasoning and spices that would otherwise be expected from sausage. The noodles are a bit chewy - very al dente, which I LOVE. And the sauce is a nice red gravy. They garnish with a tiny sprig of rosemary, which really takes the flavor over-the-top. As I say, it's comfort food - I even order it in the summer, when you'd anticipate it being too heavy and hot.   This last visit, I ordered a craft cocktail - the Italian Mojo. I love mules and mojitos, and this was a cross between the two. It had a very minty flavor to it, yet refreshing. The portion was nice too - I really liked the flavor. I'm glad it's offered year-round, because I also saw the seasonal cocktail list, which also looked excellent.  I give their Service a \"c\" rating not because the personalities of the waitstaff are negative or off-putting, but because they seem short-staffed. The wait to get water is long. The wait to place a drink order is long. The wait to place your food selection is long. And then there's the long wait until you receive your dish. I assume the wait for the food is long because each dish is created anew, but still - it's always a long wait to get a drink, pay or otherwise be attended to. Again, the personalities are great - they just need more waitstaff.   The volume is loud in this restaurant because it's open and airy, without drapes or carpet or any other sound buffering fabric. This is not a place to go to the bar and sit with a book as you eat. This is a place where you go to the bar, sit and watch the tv while you eat.   I've only ordered the pizza once here. Upon placing my order, I was asked if I wanted my pizza \"wet\". I had no idea what that meant, and honestly, calling a pizza wet is unsavory. Basically it means it's a little undercooked so the cheese and dough aren't burnt - no black on the crust. I honestly like hand-tossed pizza elsewhere (see my other reviews), but I wouldn't say Pomo's Pizza tasted bad at all.   There have only been a couple times when it's so busy at Pomo that there was a wait, so now, even on slow nights, I make reservations."}
{"text":"After a bit of confusion about the location (google maps still lists only the old location although it notes that it is closed), we found our way to Pomo. The place was hopping! It had a wonderful outdoor area as well as tables inside. And the shiny silver tile-encrusted indoor pizza oven looks like it comes out of a science fiction movie, but it certainly puts out the pizza.   We started with salads - a Romano and a misto (field greens) salad which were both large enough to share. My recommendation would be for two people to share a salad or plan to share pizza or other main course.   All of us ordered pizzas which are thin crust and approximately 11-12 inches. I had the capricciosa which was excellent - prosciutto, olives, artichoke hearts and mushrooms. We all agreed that the pizzas were good albeit a bit soupy, maybe due to the fact that the 900+ degree pizza oven didn't allow them to be as crisp as other ovens.  They had a nice selection of Italian wines by the glass and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Love their pizza, pastas, and drinks!  They have a wonderfully spicy Arrabiata sauce that I get on top of my pasta.  Love the fine quality of food!"}
{"text":"Divine. From the chili infused oil, to the perfect crust, out of this world flavors and exceptional Creme brûlée for dessert. It was the perfect sizing for three gals to grab a late night indulgent snack. And our waitress was a sweetheart. Can't wait to go back! #takesthecake #ireallythoughtidhadgoodpizza #newfave"}
{"text":"I can't believe I drove 30 minutes to try out Pomo!  Barely one star for the food and four for the server.  The rice ball was not crispy as should have been and not a lot of flavor.  The reason my wife and I went was for the \"great\" pizzas.  Not!  We both asked for extra crispy and both came out as a soggy mess.  Also the add ons, sausage and salami could not have been more than an ounce at most.  There are at least five places we go that have thinner, crispier crusts and better sauce, cheese and better toppings. Go figure?"}
{"text":"I think the food is good but beware of the terrible service.  The front desk hostess are young and rude, have no class. We waited 20 minutes before our server finally came over. They just seem so disorganized and not focused on good customer service. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful ambience - great outdoor bar!  The bartenders are friendly and attentive.  The vino is excellent and the lasagne is to die for!  Also had the pizza and it was good as well.   I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Adorable pizzeria! While usually it's \"all about the food\", not so at Pomo. From the minute you walk in you are immersed in the ambiance of Italia. From the floor to vaulted ceiling mural of an Italian street scene, to the living wall of herbs, and the bar area that is decked out with products for purchase to deck out your kitchen pantry - yup, Pomo is pretty amazing!   The food is lovely, and best shared with a group of friends or family. And speaking of family, if you are lucky enough to meet the fabulous owner, he will definitely make you feel like you are family.   Until I return to sunny Scottsdale, ciao bella Pomo!"}
{"text":"After seeing SOI 4 (Thai place in the same complex) was nearly empty at 8pm on a Friday night (never a good sign), my boyfriend and I stumbled upon Pomo Pizzeria. This was the best \"stumble upon\" I've had in a long time!   We sat outside at the bar, which made for great people watching. The three bartenders were all very friendly, but Shelly really stood out, taking the time to learn and remember our names. She offered her recommendations and since we'd never been there before, we took them! We started with the meatball appetizer. The flavor of the meatballs and sauce were great, although the meatballs weren't very hot. Another minute or two on the heat would have been great.   For our entrees, we decided to split a pizza and a pasta. Great decision! For the pizza we selected the Principe: prosciutto, arugula, and parmesan. EXCELLENT.  I can't recall the name of the pasta dish we had, but it was homemade pasta with sausage and rosemary in a tomato cream sauce. SO GOOD. A bit on the salty side (and I love salt) but not offensive. I imagine if some one isn't big on salt they wouldn't like it, though. The pasta was perfectly cooked and had a great bite to it.   Shelly, knowing it was our first time there, surprised us with dessert: the most amazing panna cotta I have ever had. Creamy, not overly sweet, and the perfect amount of vanilla. YUM.   We love trying new restaurants and with so many in Scottsdale it's easy not to go to the same place twice. However, we had such a great meal here that will will absolutely put this into regular rotation!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in AZ! I've been here twice and it's been amazing both times. Excellent service! Think our server was EJ? Can't remember. I've had their pizza, gnocchi sorrentina, strozzapreti salsiccia pasta, eggplant parmigiana appetizer, bruschetta classica, and wine. Can't go wrong with any. Love the environment too. I am pretty spoiled when it comes to Italian restaurants because I grew up in the SF Bay Area, but this one is definitely a must-try!! Definitely will be returning when my family comes back to visit me!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Arizona.  Food and pizza is fantastic. Only negative is I'm really surprised they don't have fresh sea salt for every table.  They use processed salt that is iodized. Don't let the salt keep you away though. Everything else is amazing! Maybe they will see this post and step it up on their salt."}
{"text":"Love Pomo! All their menu items are great I love how they have olive oil to pour on anything although I wish they had ranch! I know its not the Italian way but many people love dipping their pizza in ranch it'll make me very happy to have that as an options."}
{"text":"Was out hitting casinos and bumming around and decided we wanted some pizza so we found this place on Yelp and stopped in. Our server Amber was fantastic. She was very funny, charming and answered all our questions. She also never let our drinks get past halfway empty before refilling them. Ordered an appetizer of bread and olives and then a pizza and everything was really good. If I'm back in this area, I will definitely hit them up again."}
{"text":"Pomo Scottsdale-very good food, but bad attitude. Made res. for wife's bday. Requested specific table. Told hostess was bday. Checked week before res.. Told everything okay. Arrived & shown to table on patio. Someone else at table I requested. Had fine meal. Check brought. No mention of bday. Got up & talked to 2 managers on duty. Couldn't they even afford a scoop of ice cream with a candle in it? 1 manager then tried to make amends, but the damage was done. So be extra careful if you go there for a special occasion."}
{"text":"It's a wonderful place to take your sweetie when she is craving pizza.  The place can accommodate parties from one to many and features a fun gelato bar, if you feel so inclined.  The Peroni's, while smooth and refreshing, pairing well with the pies, are about $7 a bottle.  I'm usually not much for white pies, but the vegetarian in me couldnt resist ordering the Quattro Formaggi, with its irresistible blends of mozzarella, gorgonzola, provola cheese, parmigiano reggiano.  The vegetarian in me also couldnt resist the Don Alfonso because in the photo, the light played so well off the spicy salame and sausage.  The Panna Cotta was a perfect finish to the meal.  Next time gelato..."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place. I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. Tony and Mikey are phenomenal bartenders as well as Chantel who is drop dead gorgeous and so so sweet! The food is... UHHHMAZING! Cocktails are always on point and their wine list is massive! Great place for family dinner, a nice date, or just a night out!!"}
{"text":"This place has been one of my favs for awhile when it was in the Borgota. I will say the new location in the gainey village is much cuter. They really have created an amazing atmosphere. Downside is the service was horrible. They forgot our appetizer first and it came out after everyone else in the party had already finished their starter. Then it happened again with one of the pizzas and we ended up having to take it to go. The waitress was apologetic but told us she wasn't aloud to talk to the kitchen to tell them to cancel it since we were finished with all the food. The food that we did get was good as always, which is why I'm still giving 3 stars. Since service was the only thing really horrible (assuming the mistakes were the waitress not the kitchen), I will go back to try again at the new location."}
{"text":"Arrived for lunch, ordered our pizzas, after 40 minutes, pizzas still haven't arrived, spoke to waiter and ask for them to box the pizzas, server told us that manager was on the way to the table, saw manager, but never came to our table. Saw pizzas being served to guests that arrived after us. Notified hostess that we were leaving and never coming back."}
{"text":"My husband and I just celebrated our 5yr anniversary at Pomo last night. This was our first time to the restaurant and we had a great experience! We ordered the Affettati Misti, crocchete pugliesi, and the Romana salad for starters. Then we ordered the Regina Margherita and the Toto Sapore pizza. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. We were given excellent service by everyone except our own server. She must have been new or had too many tables to look after. We had many other servers coming by to look after us, so it turned out fine. To end our night we stepped over to the sister store that is an Italian market. We were greeted by John and enjoyed an engaging and educating conversation about the \"family\" farm in Italy where they grow and harvest the olives. It was very fascinating to learn about the process of making olive oils. We ordered the Semifreddo for dessert and I wish I could have taken some home for later :) I'm looking forward to going back to Pomo soon!"}
{"text":"Good food , good pizza but not the AUTHENTIC NEAPOLITAN PIZZA , nice atmospher , love the giant photo of a street in Napoli and the magnificent wood burning oven."}
{"text":"I am a major pizza-holic and pomo is my absolute favorite pizza place in the world! They're service is amazing and the vibe there is so comfortable and fun. My fiancé and I go there almost once a week. I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants an affordable and yummy night out!"}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh and the restaurant has a nice ambiance. You pay a little more, but you're getting a quality product. I go there often."}
{"text":"Pomo is back, closer to my house and better than ever. I am sooo happy they are finally open. This is hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten. Ohhhhh so good. The new place is ultra cute as well, with an added market. I am happy I don't have to drive all the way to Central Phx for this type of deliciousness. I may have had Pomo two nights in a row. oops."}
{"text":"I have hit the trifecta!  I am mega rich.....in pizza,  that is.  I woke up this morning and was in the mood for some pizza (as always!).  I decided to drive down and check out the Pomo in Scottsdale.  This was the third, and last Pomo I have been to.  I parked in the lot, walked inside and was seated at a table. I sat there for a good 5 minutes or so before anyone came over to greet me.  I thought things were going to be bad, but they improved greatly later on.  My server arrived and I got a glass of water as well as a \"Peppino\" Pizza.  Here is how it was..........  Peppino Pizza-  This pizza had spicy salame and ricotta cheese as the toppings (in addition to the tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella).  I took a bite and was instantly impressed.  Those ovens sure make magic happen.  The crust was nicely charred but not burnt, the mozzarella was creamy, and the salame was plentiful and provided a nice carnivorous flavor.  The only thing I did not really like was the ricotta.  Sure, it was there, but it didn't really add anything to the mix.  Overall, this pizza (minus the ricotta) was fantastic.  It was just as good as their other locations for the most part.  At the end of my meal, my server came over and asked if it was my first time here.  I told him yes, this specific location,  and that I had been to the Downtown and Glendale ones before.  He started asking me which one I preferred (Downtown location BTW...just something about it) and then started talking to me about the ovens etc.  Somehow, this conversation we had made it to the manager, Terry.  He came over and introduced himself and thanked me for coming in.  He also said they were opening one in Gilbert in the next few months (Eastsiders, rejoice!).  Service started out a little rocky, but at the end it was awesome!    Not sure if I'm coming back to this specific one any time soon (the other 2 are closer to my house), but if you are in the area, you probably can't find a better pizza!  This place is legit and one of the best pizzas in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place on my way to the airport and had the best early Sunday Funday EVER; hanging out wit Bianca at the bar. Talk about a stellar experience and the culture is so authentic. Coming back to this spot next time I'm in AZ."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 6 people and they had a hard time locating the reservation. We waited over 30 minutes to get our drinks. The waitress had no idea about there gin options. The food came out with no order. She forgot our soup and served the bread with our pizza after we were done with appetizers. The pizza was very good and the lasagna had no sauce and meat was greasy!   The waitress appeared to be untrained but, nice."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner last night and started with bruschetta for an app. It comes with 2 so we ordered 2 orders for 4 people. For some reason there was no cheese on it? I found it odd. The topping on the toasted bread was a mixture of diced tomatoes, olive oil, oregano, basil and another spice. It was plain and very odd not having cheese on it. 2 stars for the bruschetta.  The pizza here is absolutely delicious though! Wow. Wood-fired with obviously quality ingredients. The lasagna has to be the best lasagna I have ever had! I think it's necessary to order a pizza when you go here, but definitely order the lasagna too.  For dessert, we had creme brûlée. It was yummy!  Overall, good service and good food. Don't get the bruschetta though."}
{"text":"I think that Pomo is one of the best pizza's ever, and I'm from the east coast. It's thin crust, fresh and made with the very best ingredients. I find it's a special night when we go there. They have a great outside covered patio as well as a very nice inside area to eat. Many of the ingredients are brought in from Italy. I think this is an adult place, but kids are welcomed. Parking is great. One person named Cricket stands out in my mind, as she is over seeing the wait staff and she makes sure everyone is enjoying their meals. The pizza is on the wet side, so be aware of what you are ordering. We also usually split a salad, as they are large and very good. I also think this place would be a good place to take a date, as it's a cut above the rest."}
{"text":"Don't bother with pizza to go; mediocre at best. In-restaurant meals excellent, but pizza at home lukewarm and soggy."}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere.  Good bartender.  Pizza was close to a A+.  Toppings were fresh, the crust and cheese were delicious, I just found the sauce to be a little runny and it made the crust a little soggy.  Could have been impacted by the vegetable topping.  Also, maybe I missed it, but would have liked to see some non-pork meat options like meatball.    Nevertheless, this is an absolute place to return to!  Great spot."}
{"text":"I love pomo s pizza,perhaps the closest to italian pizza,so light and crispy,a truly good experience.thank you pomo from a \"paisa' \""}
{"text":"Met friends for a weekday dinner.  Hostess referred to us as 'you guys' We all ordered pizza...my tab came to over $22.00 with tip....pizza and water.  Pizza was horrid.  It steams on the plate causing pizza to become soggy.  My friend ate her pizza with a fork.  Heck Fired Pie is better at. 1/3 of price.  I don't need to pay hi scottsdale prices for mediocre pizza. Server was attentive but saw us as a low tip table as no drinks. I'll not return"}
{"text":"This pizza is outstanding if you only eat the outer ring of the pie. The crust is crispy and chewy all at the same time and the sauce and toppings are fresh and top quality. The problem is the soggy middle. It's damp and gooey and without texture, unless dampness and goo are considered textures. Disclaimer: the menu has a warning for us uncultured types who have never been to Napoli: the pizza's supposed to be this way. I'll have to take their word for it. And I apologize if I'm criticizing them for being what they are, like rejecting a dog for a wet nose.  That said, Pizzeria Bianco, a peer restaurant, manages to keep it crispy-chewy all the way through.  Follow-up:  the day after posting, I received a gracious note from a manager named Tessa. She told me they will gladly cook the pizzas longer if asked. I would definitely recommend that!  She really did leave a kind and professional message, which speaks volumes about the people running this place."}
{"text":"Wow.  Amazing service and the best tomatoes I have ever eaten.  Wonderfully thin and crispy pizza dough, delicious caprese, I'll be heading back soon!"}
{"text":"I don't think I could say this was the best Pasta and pizza ever, but the service was great for a party of nine and no complaints about the food. We had a reservation here for a work dinner. The server was attentive and answered all of our questions. We never had an empty cup of water. I had the carbonara, my coworker had another pasta the salsiccia, which kind of reminded me of chef Boyardee but way better quality, and my other coworker near me had some kind of pizza with pesto and shrimp on it. Got the burrata as an app. I think everyone on the other side thoroughly enjoyed their food. My carbonara was exactly what I had expected, and somehow I managed to finish the whole thing. Good for groups and just a date night dinner. I would go back but it's definitely nothing I'd crave for if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Doesnt get much better than this...The food is first rate and consistant.  Try everything except I was not a fan of the Vegetable Lasagna...Pizza is first rate...Be sure to make a reservation if you go Thurs-Sun."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, service was great and love the atmosphere! Sat at the bar one evening during the week and had wine, the Pomo pizza and caprese salad all out of this world! Bartenders were great for wine recommendations and super attentive. Will be a frequent customer here!"}
{"text":"The Valley has an abundance of pretty delicious pizza, so it's hard to stray from some of your current favorites to check out anything unfamiliar. But I am so incredibly glad to have met Pomo and its delicious pies from Napoli. Having spent quite a bit of time in Italy (mostly eating) and having never met a true Italian pizza in the US - this place has moved up several notches on my preferred pizza scale given its authenticity. My perfect pizza is one with perfectly, gently burnt crust and the perfect (aka light) amount of sauce to toppings ratio - one that begs for a glass of wine. Ecco-la.  The Scottsdale location is lovely.The inside looks delightful and inviting, though I've only enjoyed the patio which is also extremely pleasant. Excellent wine choices for the vino lovers and the menu has something delicious for anybody or any mood. The Mista salad was refreshing and simple (though a tad heavy on the dressing). Both the Bufala and Ortolana pizze were fantastic. We were lucky enough to enjoy Pomo's personal pizzas at the Italian Festival last weekend - a staff member told us the owner's mother made all the dough for the festival the night before. Sure enough she was rolling it out right there per order! Their ability to make a pie on the fly that was just as good as those served at the restaurant was very impressive.  Bravo Pomo. Bravissimo!"}
{"text":"Okay Pomo, I've changed my mind. You deserved another chance. So we came back as promised and our experience was indeed, much better than the first time. My girlfriend and I split the Don Alfonso pizza and the arancini. Both above our expectations. The moscato and profiteroles were also good. Thank you Cricket for your warm hospitality. We'll be back. ;-)"}
{"text":"I ate here the other day and although the service was impeccable the food was extremely bland. I I ordered the caprese salad and I had a pizza with pancetta, olives, and artichoke hearts. I found myself salting and peppering each dish. I guess nothing tastes as good as home cooked Italian food. I will most likely not return."}
{"text":"Was not impressed. Beautiful inside and food presentation was very nice. Service was also good. Mushroom soup was delicious. Had the salad with beets and tomatoes and there might actually have been beets and tomatoes in the salad but very, very few. Watched food workers mold dough without gloves ..... not good."}
{"text":"Pomo Pizzeria is probably the best pizza I have ever had in my life.  I am not usually a bread person when it comes to eating pizza, but the crust was as good as the main toppings.  Make sure to get some olive oil to drizzle on the pizza as it gives it an enriched flavor to the pizza toppings itself.  We had a couple different pizzas, but I would recommend the Pomo.  You can add and subtract toppings at your ease without too much complications either."}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar watching the panini get pressed. Soccer game on the TV overhead.  Delicious sandwiches made with some of the best bread I have ever tasted. Great feel to this place, close your eyes, take in the sounds and the smells and you will certainly think you are in Milano!  Food, atmosphere service staff...It's all great! buon appetito!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times were excellent.  The pizza is very authentic and delicious.  I love the spicy olive oil they put on the table when the pizza arrives.  I have also tried the caprese and mango salads.  Both were deliciious.  As far as pizzas, I suggest the margherita or marinara.  Both are excellent.  I also had the diavola and that was good, but the vpn pizzas are why I come here.  Very friendly wait staff and the bar tender was great."}
{"text":"Ingredients matter. I had the Bufalo Pizza, which had a nicer cheese and seemingly sauce. It was solid. Worth 4 stars. Crust a tad on the breadish side, but I finished with a clean plate.  Everyone else had pizzas with the standard cheese and tomato sauce + toppings. I tried one slice out of curiosity. What a difference. It's like comparing apples and crap. I spit it out. They all ate half their pizzas at most."}
{"text":"I liked the atmosphere of this restaurant. Very spacious, well decorated and organized. I was in for lunch, but it looks like it might be better at night, especially if your group size is relatively big (more than 5 or so).   Our server was very kind and fun, and all the staffs were very well trained, I think. The pizza was good (we had two different kinds), but to me, there are a couple of better places to go for pizza at this price range. I would love to go again if I am around, but it is unlikely for me to drive here just for pizza if I am away from this location."}
{"text":"Completely a Class Act Location.   Was not what I was expecting... they did go over and above... Great Food and even Greater Customer Service. Started off with an incredible salad that everything is super fresh and all done in house.  To top that off, you of course have to do a pizza, since the restaurant has a huge center wood burning oven / clave.  But what made the evening was two factors. 1) finding the right wine, the server made recommendations and brought several out to taste till the right pairing was achieved.  2) can't have Italian without ordering Spaghetti with meat bolognese.  Came out and I was so happy with everything else, I shied away from the disappointment of sauce.  After a slight mention and saying next time I will try the other one, suggested.... well, when asking for the check, my server came out with one to go with the other Rosemary sauce and insisted to have it later or next day... which truly blew me away.  I laugh cause in Europe there is no way you get this service, in most cafe you sprall for extra hand towels for instance.  Very happy and Very much so going back.  What a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Arancini Siciliano, Crochette, Margherita, Tagliatelle Bolognese.  Friendly, open, comfortable, great pizza.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Came with a group. Nobody ordered pizza, every one was happy.  There were good things to say about the various salads and soups that came first. Misto salad and Minestrone both got good comments  Dinner was a some gnocchi and pasta dishes. I had the lasagna and someone near me had the Arrabiatta \"really spicy, really good\".  I enjoyed the lasagna and judging by all the clean plates, around the table, I was not alone.   They make their pasta fresh daily. Such a difference!  Service was good and our food came out with good timing. Would like to go back for the pizza sometime."}
{"text":"Tony was a fantastic bartender! He was very accommodating in creating my special order cocktail....and it was delicious!! And the food here is always top notch. I definitely recommend coming here and sitting at the bar on the patio. Ask for Tony :)"}
{"text":"Food is usually on par here, and this was our 4th time dining here. Our server named Chris was in \"a hurry\", demonstrated poor communication, and barely attended to us during my wife's birthday dinner, so we were a bit disappointed. He made an annual special occasion a subpar experience for us.   When he finally took the time to visit us and requested for our order, he did not recommend any wine to us either. Neither did he ask \"Are you guys celebrating anything special?\"   So, usually we receive good service here and we go out of our way to travel to Pomo, but they (owners and management) truly need to filter out the wait staff that is all about \"making money\", doing more with less and make it more about truly serving customers in a timely way with quality service.  Problem we experienced: after he visited us after 20-25 mins of waiting for him to take the order, there was a delay after this to deliver the wood fired pizza to the table because he held the order, since the lasagna we ordered took longer to prepare- at least that was the excuse we heard. However, he did not communicate it to us in this way prior to taking order, and we could have opted to have the pizza first which arrived cold at our table! Nice job, Pomo!!!   But, Pomo- please do yourselves a favor and augment your wait staff and retrain these young waiters who have no idea how/when food is prepared and to take time out to serve and understand your customer's needs."}
