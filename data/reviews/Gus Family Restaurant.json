{"text":"Consistantly decent food at a decent price. The staff are nice and friendly as is the owner. For breakfast ask for your biscuits grilled, awesome!"}
{"text":"The foods great and the staff is excellent and the prices are very reasonable.The grilled chicken is the best I've ever had we will be back"}
{"text":"This is a great place if you like it when the staff are rude and loudly make inappropriate comments and curse when there are numerous children present.  \"Family restaurant\"......not so much.  Definitely won't be back and don't recommend."}
{"text":"I was traveling for work in Monroe, so I decided to try this local favorite for lunch. I heard good things from some customers about this place.

Gus Family Restaurant is a modest place off the main road a bit.  If you know that going in, the look of the building will not be a disappointment.

The wait staff was friendly, if not a tiny bit over worked.  My waitress was hustling my entire visit but I never felt like I had to wait on anything.

The food came out fast.  I got the hand breaded fried chicken with white gravy.  It was a bit bland, but that is typical for this type of establishment. 

However the meal was a very good deal considering the prices.  Way better than fast food, and cost the same.

I worked recommend this place to the budget friendly eater, but be prepared for modest surroundings and you'll want to add salt."}
{"text":"Not the easiest find but if you find yourself here you won't be disappointed. Nicely portioned meal and very well prepared. Had the hamburger steak with gravy and onions, fried squash and beets (yummy)."}
