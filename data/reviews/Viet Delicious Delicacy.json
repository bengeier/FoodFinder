{"text":"I think this place is under new management. I had been going fairly regularly since 2011, and by and large everything I had had was quite good, more deserving of a 4-star rating, but this time the recipes had changed, the people cooking and serving were different, and things were not as good as before.

I ordered a mango salad to start, and it was just chopped iceberg lettuce with frozen gritty mango and Caesar dressing on top... as if they didn't know what a mango salad was.

Hot and sour seafood soup was still good, full of nice squid and fish balls, but it had been more sour last time I went - now it just seemed like a regular spicy soup which was a bit of a disappointment.

Shrimp on sugar cane is better than it was under the last management though, and pickled radish was good."}
{"text":"my family came here fresh from the us border and had no cash. we had been rejected from the vietnamese place across the street from the mall, and were left wanting some pho. luckily this place took credits cards and we were able to get a really decent meal.

the best thing was the spicy seafood soup. we got the large size and it was huge. it was really tangy and spicy, with generous chunks of seafood, super aromatic, not too greasy. could have eaten that all night. we also got the marinated pork cold noodle and that was pretty good and standard. we also got chicken wings, which were also really normal. the pho was mediocre too, but the worst part was that we weren't given any limes/lemons or basil or mung sprouts with it. the service was really awful. it was just some teenagers and i think they must have been the sons of the owners. they didn't really care. we had to ask for so much stuff (silverware and bowls and other essentials) that by the time the pho came around, we were sick of asking for things and really hungry and didn't ask for those sides. just a note though - the table next to us got them, so we knew they had them!

aside from the terrible service, things were okay. totally worth it to settle a craving and use a credit card haha."}
{"text":"2.5 star for Viet Delicious Delicacy which is located on the second floor of Pacific Mall.

Price? Excellent! All Day Specials from $6.99 that includes a drink (fruity slush/hot drink/cold drink)

Special Pho Small with Mango Slush ($6.99) is great portion as a light dinner. The noodle though taste quite well but the broth is just too one dimensional lacking the complex taste of herbs.

Mango slush just a cold sugary drink!? I don't really taste any fresh mango. I can't imagine paying $3.49 for the drink.

Viet Delicious Delicacy has a really plastic feel, from that heavy sticky plastic sheet cover to the plastic cover of the menu... A dirty and a little sticky everywhere."}
