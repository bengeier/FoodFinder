{"text":"Had pizza from here the other day got the chicken pesto it was great. Friend got the gluten free tomato basil, said it was fantastic. Can't wait to go back and try other pizza and one of their salads. Look grand"}
{"text":"I am new to the Casa Grande area. A friend mentioned the new pizza place at the Promenade Shopping Plaza with a wood pizza oven. It was my first time so I ordered a pizza.  Being from New Jersey, where most places have excellent pizza, my expectations were high. H & H did not disappoint!  Pizza was really good, staff are very friendly. Even the owner came by our table to make sure everything was good.
Reasonable prices too.  I hope you will stop by and support this great place & then share with your friends!"}
{"text":"It's close by our house, so I was really hoping it to be another regular to our list.  Seeing the pictures I thought it looked like real Italian style pizza.  It looks like it, but it's very wet and soggy.  Unfortunately we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pizza was barely warm,  ordered a tomato basil with prosciutto and arugula. Arugula was wilted and old, he forgot the basil, and the crust was not cooked completely. Poor attempt at a properly cooked wood oven pizza and fresh toppings were non existent. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Some of the best thin crust pizza in the area. They're quick and are always very friendly. I would definitely recommend the chicken pesto. Will definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"The pizza is super delicious! I have been here a few times and they have great service. I would definitely recommend the pesto pizza!:)"}
{"text":"We just finished lunch here for the fourth time.

We have tried the Tri City Meat, the Meatball Marinara, and the Hawaiian.  They were all freshly made and fired, loaded with toppings, and delicious.

On our last two trips, we have brought a bottle of wine, which they corked at the ridiculously low  price of $1 per person.  What a deal!

Today, we noticed they had added ice cream to the menu, and only $1.50 per scoop.

This is really some gourmet food, and they deal it out at fast food prices.  Take advantage of it now!

Marshall has been there the past few times we have visited and I can't begin to express how great he is at customer service.  They truly seem to want you to be as comfortable and satisfied as possible.  Chris was working with  him today and was professional and courteous.

The atmosphere is clean and tidy, and all of the condiments  you might want (including EVOO) are there for your convenience.

I highly recommend this place for a snack, a meal, or even a party!"}
{"text":"Meet ball sub was very good and fresh. Meet ball pizza was very good and the Caesar salad was very good too. The environment was very clean just an all around great experience."}
{"text":"Their pizza is freaking gooooood. My coworker and I always get the cheese pizza. It's really good! I work at Fresche and they are always so willing to deliver next door. I love them! And they are so friendly!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Some competition to Grimaldi's that recently closed down."}
{"text":"Awesome wood fired pizza! H&H has great prices and the employees are friendly. Out family comes here often and it's always a great experience!"}
{"text":"This isn't your traditional papa johns generic pizza smothered in cheese. This is artisan style pizza, wood fired. It tastes amazing. I usually get the California club or the chicken pesto. I also enjoy the dipping sauce trio with the garlic bread for a inexpensive appetizer. Can't believe the great prices they have, the prices are about half of what you expect for this kind of pizza, and this company seems to get better over time as they perfect their art. Definitely can't go wrong for the price or the taste"}
{"text":"If you like salty and greasy pizza, then this is the place for you. Called and spoke to manager and he confirmed that their pizzas are more salty and grease due to the way they are cooked."}
{"text":"GREAT place! Pizza is alway fresh and amazing! I go every time I'm in the area! The chicken pesto is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Grinder sandwich is pretty good but the pizza is a huge disappointment. Pretty wimpy & flavorless, very few toppings."}
{"text":"Tried H&H on a whim. 

Ambiance was nice with plenty of seating. Decor was a bit odd (a bunch of senior-style portraits - the owner's kids perhaps?).

Their prices are a tad high for my liking for a \"personal\" pizza, but since it's more than one person can eat in a single sitting, it's not terrible. The garlic cheesy bread is basically cheese on pizza dough with garlic. Though it did taste decent, it is not bread, so just be aware. I ordered a white pizza and was not impressed - overly salty and the use of cream cheese instead of ricotta wasn't a great substitution over a classic white pizza. Also, for being thin crust, the pizza was pretty limp - have never had a limp thin crust before. 

The service was pretty fast from order to receiving your order.

I don't have much to compare it to as far as an apples-to-apples personal pizza comparison, but I think that Sauce's pizzas, which are about the same size, are of better quality, if of fewer options.

Also - needed to use the restroom while I was there (which was perfectly clean), but it felt very awkward to have to walk through their storage/prep area to get to it. Strangers in the storage/prep area just seems strange to me!"}
{"text":"I went today and the restaurant has closed.  Apparently, they were behind on their rent.   Very sad as they were only open for a few months!"}
{"text":"We got a flyer for this in our mail, so decided to give this local joint a shot.  Hubby ordered the Hawaiian and I the Sausage and Peppers... I was expecting something to match the photos from Yelp but was, unfortunately, disappointed that my pizza had raw peppers and a very soggy center... so bad that every slice from my pizza split in two from the sogginess... bummer.  The flavor of both was also pretty bland - nothing special.
The place itself is nice and modern-decor and clean... and staff was very friendly and prompt with the phone order and the completion.... 
I think the idea is great, but the execution was very lacking.
Not sure if I\"ll eat there again... not impressed."}
{"text":"We first had pizza from here at a friend's house. They ordered the pepperoni, cheese, and bbq chicken pizza. I didn't think I would care for the bbq chicken pizza, but it was surprisingly delicious!

My son and his friend had basketball practice that evening and this pizza was light and not heavy, so that was a good thing.

Went to H&H later than evening to order my husband a pizza (forgot what its called, but had Italian meats) for dinner after he was done with work. He enjoyed it a lot too!

We have been back here several times. Each time service has been friendly and pizza wonderful. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very much Neapolitan pizza . Very we'll made.
We had a tomato basil pizza and a chicken pesto pizza. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"Not bad for a little pizza joint. I got the pepper sausage pizza. Not bad. Seems like something I could make at home, but I didn't, so I paid them. The wings were frozen and kind of bland. I'll only go back if I have to wait a stupid amount of time at Fantastic Sams again."}
{"text":"All the ingredients are fresh and the combinations on their specialty pizza's  are pretty amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is ok.  It is kid friendly which is nice.   It's really small which was surprising.  Anyhow, the pizza is super thin and the sauce is just ok.   They do make everything fresh to order which is nice, and all the ingredients tasted fresh.   I've had friends tell me that it's really good, but they said the owner was there.   When I went there were only kids working.  I think you get a different experience if there are adults there supervising.  It's not awful, it's just not what I would call good.   On a positive not a few people got dessert that looked awesome, and the service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"My first experience was a pizza and wing delivery. First, they quoted 60 minutes and the friendly delivery man was at my doorstep in 45 minutes. Pleasantly surprised! Second, we ordered the Tricity meat, the White pizza and Chipolte Ranch chicken wings (I think those are the correct names). They were all delicious!! I agree with the one review regarding the soggyness (referring only to my White pizza) but that did not hinder my overall opinion because the flavor on the White was awesome. Third and last, super affordable! I will definitely order there again!"}
{"text":"This pizza rocks. As often as I have been able to, I have made my way over there! I have tried the strawberry fusion (the goat cheese is surprisingly very delicious!!), the chicken pesto pizza (which happens to be my favorite) and the California club (it's like the best of both worlds between a sandwich and a pizza). Sure it's thin crust and not crispy like you would expect, but personally with ingredients and combinations such as that, I prefer to be able to bite through to softer crust! Whoever came up with these recipes is considered a genius in my mind"}
{"text":"This pizza is incredible.  We used to go to Grimaldi's but they closed the location closest to us.  After going to H&H we will come back often, especially after they get their beer and wine license.  Prices are super reasonable, the owners are awesome but most importantly the pizza is wonderful.  I can't believe they can put out such tasty pizza at such reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I liked the sauce a lot.  But I was SOOO disappointed with the LACK of cheese.  I had tons of fresh basil and little cheese.  I think they should add more cheese, less fresh basil.   The crust was super thin and crispy, but I wonder if that was because there was little cheese on it.  I added sausage, barely got any on my pizza.  I am sure they are trying to work out the kinks.I will give it one more try.  I think it's a good place with kids because you order, sit, and it is FAST to cook.   The owners were super nice.  I with them the best of luck"}
{"text":"Without question one of the best pizza places in all of AZ! If you like huge, thick crust pizzas smothered in sauce, cheese & pepperoni, then this place is NOT for you. The pizzas they serve here are all Neapolitan-style thin crust single serving pizzas with very unique topping options. I have had just about every pizza on the menu - 4 cheese, Tri City Meat, Chicken Pesto, Chicken Cordón Bleu, BBQ Chicken, California Club, Sausage & Pepper, and Strawberry Fusion - and they are all EXCELLENT! My favorites are probably Cali Club, Strawberry Fusion, and BBQ Chicken. I have yet to try the Veggie Delight (I like meat on my pizza), Asian Persuasion (with peanut sauce, chow mein noodles, chicken, sesame seeds & lettuce) or the Artichoke (artichoke hearts, parmesan, mozzarella & cream cheeses, onions, and basil). Also never tried their wings or other sides or the sandwiches, but I come here for the pizza so I don't plan on it either. And last but not least make sure to get one (or two!) of their marscapone cheese & strawberry dessert pizzas!! Mmmmmm......"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite and enjoyed a very tasty Hawaiian pizza baked in a wood burning oven. Felt like of could have been priced higher as it was a nicer \"fancy\" pizza with great presentation but was only $7!! Husband also tried some wings that were oven baked crispy and tasty.   Will def be visiting again"}
{"text":"My family and I were hesitant about eating here due to the 3.5 star rating and mixed reviews but were starving and wanted to try a little something new. The pizza is thin crust so I'm not sure what people are expecting when they rant about it being limp in the middle. It was a little oily But the flavor was great, the people were great, and we were pleased with the all around service. We got a regular pepperoni pizza and a pepperoni mushroom and sausage pizza. We also had the pleasure of enjoying their garlic cheesy bread! It was about 9:00pm when we had walked in on a Saturday, things were quiet, the staff was friendly and helpful in answering our questions. We waited about 10 minutes and they had a nice warm  cheesy bread plate on our table. 10 minutes after that our pizza was served. So happy we found our new little hole in the wall pizza place! We will definitely be regular customers."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with work friends and it was pretty awesome.  I had the TriCity Meat pizza, very good and filling. Nice alternative to the standard pizza joint.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pizza is great.  Just as good as the high end brick oven pizza places without the high price tag.  I keep going back for a reason.  Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Came here with my foodie partner in crime last night.  He found it on Yelp and said we should try this place since it was nearby.  If you are a pizza lover you probably have been to Pizzeria Bianco and Cibos (my favorite pizza restaurant) in town.  Now this place is a different concept then the above mentioned restaurants.  It reminds me of someone with passion for pizza but wanting a more casual family atmosphere.  There is take out and the location is at a standard newer neighborhood plaza.

When we first walked in we were a little surprised.  The pictures of the pizzas on yelp led me to think this was going to be a nice sit down restaurant with an Italian flair.  The decor is clean with modern art on the wall.  It is more informal with a few tables inside and some patio seating outside.  You order at the counter and the drinks are self serve.  You can see the big pizza oven in the middle of the kitchen and a large row of chopped wood piled next to it for fuel.  

We ordered the Egg on Top and White Pizza along with the Prosciutto Carpaccio.  Price seems inexpensive so everything looked good so far.  

The Prosciutto Carpaccio came out first.  We looked at each other and I turned to look at the menu again in amazement that it was only $7.  It was a large plate with a generous portion of prosciutto, mixed greens and wood fired baguette.  This was an awesome appetizer and made us anticipate the pizza even more.

Next came our White and Egg on Top pizza.  I will say this is the best pizza I have ever had for under $10 (both pizzas were only $8 each). The quality and flavor of both just blew us away.  As we were eating in pure delight, we were discussing how this will be our new local favorite pizza joint.  The white pizza was very flavorful and tasted like what you'd expect from something twice its price.  The Egg on Top was made with care and just unbelievable at only $8. 

If your idea of a good pizza is something from Papa Johns or Pizzeria Unos then this is probably not your style - although you can get the standard pepperoni pizza here too.  As I am writing this, I am thinking that I will go here again tonight to try a different pizza.  This place has only been open for 3 months but I am sure they will very successful once word spreads."}
{"text":"WORSE PIZZA EVER.....No Flavor whatsoever had to pile on garlic to give it some sort of taste!!!! I read all of the reviews and cannot believe people actually like this pizza! Again the worse pizza ever! Bad crust Bad sauce..will never eat there again!"}
{"text":"We got service right away when we walked to the counter. I watched my pizza being made fresh and put in the oven. I thought a twelve inch pizza wouldn't be enough but it was enough to eat there and take some home! I got the bbq chicken pizza and added bacon--amazing! I'll definitely be back for that again."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Not only is the food great, but the people who own & work here are so friendly and welcoming. I'm so happy that there a still small businesses out there with quality genuine customer service."}
{"text":"We went there today for the first time. It was clean, fast and so yummy. Their pizza was flavorful and fresh ingredients. My husband loved the white pizza and their pesto chicken was so so good. The pesto wasn't too over powering. We are glad to have found a good local non chain pizza place."}
{"text":"Opened new location in Gasa Grande by the Harkins Theaters! 

Delicious,  great prices!"}
{"text":"Friday night is pizza night.  My daughter and I came here one Friday night because I had read about this new wood fried pizza oven place and I love pizza from a wood fired oven!  The shop is located in a corner on Arizona Ave near Ocatillo.  It's a small place with some seating outside and several tables inside.  It's nothing fancy but hey, as long as the food is good, I don't really care.  We walked in and were greated by one of the owners who helped us make a decision.  I ordered the Chicken Club and my daughter had plain cheese.  We split an Asian salad.  The salad was fresh and had lots of crunch. I'm glad the dressing came on the side because it had a bit of a kick to it and my daughter does not like spice of any kind.  She was happy to eat the salad plain.  Pizza does not take long to cook in a wood fired oven.  Our salad came out and about 10 mins later the pizza was up.  The crust has just the right amount of crispness to it and the toppings were delicious.  The Chicken Club is a great choice for something different.  Chicken, bacon, avacado with arugala and chipolte ranch...Yummy!  My daughter loved her plain cheese. I love that they are all 12 inch pizzas.  My daughter likes very little on her pizza and I love to try new things so it works well for us.  My daughter wanted to try a canolli and she loved it!  I knew she would. :)  She didn't even give me a bite.  The H&H name comes from the first names of the wives of the owners.  Wise men to name their restaurant after their wives.  I love that you can see them making the pizzas and see them cooking in the wood fired oven.  While we were there many more came in for pizza.  Some seemed to know the owners and came to support them.  They also deliver!  I am lucky to be within their delivery radius.  If you are not, there is a service charge. We will be back or, if I'm too tired, we will order for delivery.  I highly recommend this great new spot!"}
{"text":"We've are on the fence about whether we like it.

Pros: 
The toppings are fresh and the combinations are great, a big step up from the domino's type  canned dead jalapeño/mushroom/mystery meat combos. We particularly liked the goat cheese/strawberry/nuts/arugula combo. No fake cheese that drowns out everything else.
Prices are great. We got a coupon in the mail for a free margarita pizza so we won.
The place is hip and laid back, no pretensions. It was my style - minimalistic. The walls are hospital white with bold colorful paintings and exposed ceiling and that sort. The wood fired furnace is the central element and it's easy go see what's going on. The wood blocks are lined up right there. 

Cons:
The toppings were sparse and there was no sauce or olive oil on the strawberry pizza, so it was like eating bread and a side salad. 
Tomato basil was tomato sauce smeared and fresh basil cut up. They literally just heat it up on the furnace, not cook it really, so I felt the toppings were bland and not integrated well to make a wholesome product. 
The base seems to be a standard white flour type. There was nothing characteristic about it - no nutty or hearty flavors that come with using high quality ingredients or other grains. 

Service is just there - you walk up and order and they bring the pizza to your table. The owners/chefs were both talking to people and seemed nice. 

Since both the cons were food related and that's what matters most about such a pick-up type place, I'll have to only give three stars. Maybe I'll go back soon and try it once more."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Decided to try it and they are close to our house, so I called for delivery.  I had the tomato basil and my fiancé had the sausage and pepper with gluten free crust.  Both were delicious!  I also got an apple purse for dessert. Excellent!  
Looking forward to going and eating at the restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place was alright until it was stuck with some woman who messes up/loses every order thrown at her. AVOID this place."}
{"text":"These are seriously great chefs who make excellent pizza at a really affordable cost. Excellent value. No screaming children!"}
{"text":"Pizza crust could use a little salt, needs to be baked a bit longer, sauce is a little overpowering. It was good, not great, with these improvements could taste better. Fresh ingredients were noted and appreciated."}
