{"text":"Nearly everything about this place is perfect - I love the high quality of the produce, the uniqueness of their health & beauty area, THE BULK BINS, the constant introduction of new items and willingness to order former ones... I could go on all day. They are out of my budget for full grocery shopping, but a fun regular stop for special treats and items I can't buy (vegan choc chip cookies) or won't buy (cilantro, green onions) at Woodmans (srsly woodman's cilantro is practically composted, gross). 

However, and what I'm docking a star for, is the inconsistent level of service from the staff. Some people are terrific and so willing to stop and see if you need help, or are just generally pleasant - especially the folks working the front desk, bulk, deli/juice bar areas. Others - almost always cashiers - seem so bothered to be there! Sorry I'm buying stuff, sorry I said Hi and asked how your day was going, sorry I said sure I'll CHIP and yes I'd like a receipt, sorry I forgot and left the unused fork and napkin on top of my box of hot food when I put it on the belt and you had to ask me to remove it. SORRY, ok??? Stop glaring at me, stop wrinkling your nose at what I'm buying, stop rolling your eyes when everything doesn't fit into my cloth bag and I have to ask for a paper one. 

I still love the stores, I will continue to shop there forever, but I do hope that they'll either hire friendlier cashiers or add in some self-check lanes."}
{"text":"A bunch of hippie organic shit. I would recommend 0 people to go shop here. Please avoid"}
{"text":"I really like both Willy Street Co-op stores.  The staff here is friendlier than the store on Williamson.  Just wish their vitamin and cosmetics section was as big and diverse as Whole Foods down the street, but it seems like they make the best of their available space."}
{"text":"Its not as big as the Willy Street location but my wife and I get most all of our produce here and a lot of other stuff as well. It is a bit more pricey then a regular grocery store if that's what you're looking for the the products all run to fair trade, organic and where possible local. Excellent selection for its size. Very glad they've opened this location as getting to the Willy Street location regularly from the far west side can be a hassle. Also should give kudos to the workers for their helpful and friendliness."}
{"text":"NOT IMPRESSED!  So we frequent east side willy all the time, and have been to the west side location only a few times and the last time we went was the worst.  Couldn't find anything we wanted, the Barista was not very knowledgeable about how to make coffees....and the coffee was very watered out.  The whole place seems over priced and like it trying to compete with WF's down the road, why change Willy Street.  People like Willy because it doesn't feel like WF's"}
{"text":"We've been shopping at the co-op for about 8 years (maybe longer?) and while we still do a rotating circuit for our groceries that involves Costco, Woodman's, Trader Joe's, and the co-op (and farmer's market when in season), the co-op is great and I am so thankful that they're both on the East and West sides so it's easy to get to one of their locations. I have significant food allergies and intolerances and I am able to find so many speciality foods here that cater to my diet. Duck eggs? Check. Goat milk kefir? Check. Sheep, goat and buffalo milk cheeses? Check.

Occasionally they do discontinue carrying products I like (really miss that brown rice & potato pizza crust that's not $9 each like the current one; also really miss the sheep yogurt from Sugar River but they stopped making it) but they have so many things I do love. And they are generally receptive to requests from customers for new things.

I do wish the veggie prices were lower, especially off-season (brussels sprouts were $9/lb last time I was there), but I understand how it's difficult to source great food when it's not seasonally available locally. That's part of the reason why we rotate our shopping to get what we need at more affordable prices. However, we have found on many things, especially cheese, that their prices are MUCH lower than Whole Foods (which I hate to support).

Also, the hot bar is great when we have family in town who have very different diets, since they prominently display their ingredients and the meat eaters and vegans can all get great options. It's not hard to get a delicious lunch for a reasonable price here."}
{"text":"A really nice grocery store that sources some local stuff and has just about everything you can want/need.  If you are a coffee snob, like me, this place has you covered with loads of different local roasters.  Their hot bar is ok and their butcher/sea food counter is very nice.  This is one of my regular stops and am grateful I live close by.  It is good."}
{"text":"Huge selection of organic, local products at great prices. Only slightly embarrassed that I make (almost) a daily stop here. Love my coop!"}
{"text":"Breakfast anyone? Wow! Went to Willy West this morning after dropping my daughter off at the High School and whoa! Buffet breakfast. Loaded my plate with Denver scramble, fresh organic bacon, oatmeal, and hash browns, all for $5.73. Where can you get a breakfast like that for $5? Awesome. You gotta check it out."}
{"text":"When I am looking for a specific locally grown, sustainable, or specialty item, I go here.  Though they don't have quite as wide of a variety as other grocery stores in the area, and they are higher priced, they make up for that with quality and unique items.  

The other thing that I love is that they are more than just a grocery store.  Though I've never had it, the hot bar always looks delicious, the baked goods are delicious (I've had those ;) ) and the smoothie bar is amazing.  It is very hard for me to drive by there on a warm summer day and not stop for a smoothie."}
{"text":"I recently used Willy St. Co-op West to cater my parent's 40th anniversary party. We were having a gathering of people at APT and wanted hot food to serve to a large quantity of people. Willy St. was on the way there so we figured it was worth a try! The catering manager was extremely helpful and polite on the phone. Any questions I had he was able to answer or get back to me with the answer. We ordered the chicken with peppers and olives and the cheese tortellini. They were both delicious, and all of the guests were very impressed with the quality of the catered food. Highly recommend it if you need an event catered, or for taking to APT!"}
{"text":"Samples from Sassy Cow, delicious single slices of double chocolate layer cake, and snack size bags of 'Dang' are what make this place exceptional for the lady with a sweet tooth. I didn't mind the 5% charge for shopping as a non-member! :)"}
{"text":"My favorite local grocery. Have been coming here for over four years and just now reviewing. Love the local, organic produce, convivial staff, local WI favorites like hook's cheese, potter crackers, madtown sourdough bread, juice bar, freshly prepared food (housemade samosa pocket with coriander and cumin, anyone?) and beer/ wine / cider selections. Also, the bulk food aisle is well organized, clean, and comprehensive.
   Today's find was freshly made sushi ( veg spring roll and tempura shrimp roll) Now, normally, I think grocery store sushi is nothing but sketchy and to be avoided at all cost... But tried it at Wiily West today and... wait for it... It was wonderfully fresh and tasty. Shut the front door! ( though, in case anyone at Willy actually reads this stuff, please give me two packets of kikkoman. Your generous ten piece roll needs more than one).
   My ONLY complaint about Willy is that its selections are too tempting. I went for a quick yogurt and milk run today and left with organic chocolate, fresh strawberries, a deli sandwich, hooks 5 yr, a smoothie, samosa, hard cider, a new wooden handled brush... You get the idea. Impulse buys are easy when everything looks this good! That was some expensive yogurt considering I left with three bags of groceries and minus $125!
  If you are good at self control... Shop away! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Finally, there is a grocery store with good bakery section. The European desserts are awesome, made absolutely in right way and as they are suppose to be made(not sweet). The Paris Brest is amazing, great job guys. Sushi with brown rice are great also."}
{"text":"Our family shops here weekly, and it's pretty one-stop shopping for us with the exception of a few random staples.  It's a family affair and most Saturday mornings the kids can sample their way through the store and take care of snack time at the same time. It's also a great place to grab a bite to eat. Willy street has opened my eyes to different ingredients that I never would have tried to cook with, especially in the produce and bulk bin departments. I appreciate the efforts to source as much as they can locally and it helps keep us on track with our goals to eat according to the seasons. I would imagine people hear organic and think expensive, but the co-op structure really is able to keep prices pretty reasonable in my opinion. The bulk aisles are excellent and the wellness products are also extensive. 
There is an expansion going on right now which will make shopping a lot more pleasurable during the busy times as the aisles will be widened eventually.  I agree that the appeal of the hot/cold bar items is hit or miss depending on when you stop by, and I find most things to be perpetually lacking in salt/seasoning, but it's largely pretty convenient and you don't feel bad about what you are quickly grabbing for lunch.  I love that I never have to wait in line for long to check out. Everyone that works there is exceedingly friendly, and the impulse buy potential of all of those cute local tees and socks and kitchen gadgets is off the chart. So many things you never knew you needed! So glad this store is in my life."}
{"text":"It takes a lot to make me finally stop giving chances to a business. I can now officially say I am DONE with the west side Co-op after my experience last night. At 6:15, I stopped to pick up some hot bar items for dinner that evening. Not only were exactly half of the bins for hot items entirely missing, but the remaining half of the buffet was completely disgusting. I was appalled and should have taken a picture; food and sauces were strewn about, hardened and stuck to the metal serving areas. Two hipster guys were chatting and laughing with each other behind the meat counter, clearly too busy to clean the hot bar that was caked with food. Disappointed, I settled on some pre-packaged sushi and packaged kale and sesame salad. 

The final straw was when I opened and began eating my $6.00 container of kale salad and just narrowly missed chowing down on a caterpillar. Of this I did take a picture. 

Good bye Co-op. Heading to Whole Foods from now on. 

Signed,
A 12-year member"}
{"text":"Even though i have lived in Madison for over 15 years, I didn't have an opportunity to become a member/owner until recently. Until the West store opened, I didn't see much of a point. Now I am glad that I did. Terrific looking and tasting bakery section, wonderful cheeses (Hint: If you wish to try a variety of cheese at home, look through the basket of \"orphans\" which sell for a buck or two, Metcalf Sentry also has something like this.) Best of all, is the hot bar/breakfast/made to order sandwiches. I found it is a very pleasant place to have a late lunch in the commons room, with newspapers to read while you eat. I hit the discount bin in the produce area and what you get there is hit or miss, but the price is very good for what you get. As mentioned, pretty good sales here for the quality you get. Be sure to check out the notices board near the classroom/kitchen demonstration area, many interesting things going on around town."}
{"text":"It's OK.  I'm a member and much prefer the original east side location.  I realize this is an additional location, but they don't have as much as the east side.  No Kickapoo coffee, much smaller personal care/beauty/etc. section.  The prepared food area is nice, as is the selection of fresh meat."}
{"text":"I do most of my shopping here. Their produce is amazing! They have great food. The hot bar is ok but they will custom make you anything. I recommend the Cubain Sandwich. It is pulled pork on a pretzels bun. I think the cheese girl knows my name."}
{"text":"In all of my travels, this is the closest thing I've found to our Ocean Beach People's Organic Coop, just outside of San Diego. Close  parallels in the produce sections, Very good selections."}
{"text":"What a super cool grocery! Bright clean space, super friendly staff, and a huge selection of organic, locally grown produce make this a must go when in the neighborhood. 

Lots of natural products and a huge variety of vegetarian & veggie/meat substitutes too. 
 
A few of the prices for produce seemed a little steep but others were quite reasonable. 

To die for salad bar items!"}
{"text":"A great staple of Madison. Love the west location with its good parking situation and fairly spacious store! The deli is amazing and we much love for the vegetarian deli sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, but the quality of the food does not come close to matching the price. I bought hummus that tasted nothing like hummus--upon looking at the ingredients list I found that tahini was so far down the list that the lack of flavor was well-explained. I also bought a paleo mama bakery salted caramel cheesecake that tasted nothing like the description, but more like a coconut rice dessert, which was not at all what I wanted. I also got a salad, which was fine, though the to-go up charge was a ridiculous $3, presumably for the box that was a chore to close and failed to remain closed. I used my own dressings because none of the available ones appealed to me. 

Every time I go to Willy Street Co-Op I regret paying the asininely high membership fee more and more. Sky high prices for very sub-par products."}
{"text":"I work nearby so the co-op has become a regular stop on the way home.  But, as a former east side shopper, let me just say that this location blows East right out of the water.  

Beautiful produce is organic, local and harvested by little fair-trade goblins. Much better selection than East. Grocery aisles full of delicious goodies that I probably shouldn't purchase (but probably will). And alcohol! Hey East, I know you have that \"agreement\" with Star Liquor but I'd rather make one stop rather than two. Hint, hint. ;)

I'm seriously confused by all of the cashier hate.  I've gotten wonderful service every time I've stopped in at West. Cashiers will go above and beyond here--they'll bag for you, they'll help you find something you're looking for, they'll bring your groceries to your car if you have a broken arm in December (hint: that was me).  I HAVE seen some pretty terrible customer behavior towards cashiers, though.  Maybe don't dump your groceries out after they've been bagged and demand that they're repacked RIGHT NOW. I'm talking to you, Miss Real Housewife of Middleton. 

Anyway, this place is awesome and I might as well sign my paycheck over to them."}
{"text":"Great produce, meat, cheese and deli. Not a huge selection in the grocery dept. it's a nice mellow place to shop. Everyone speaks to you and smiles. Little pricey. Then again it's organic so what can you expect"}
{"text":"This is a nice co-op and has a large selection.   Fresh veggies when you first walk in and the store flows.   The service was average in a good way and I will be back here to buy my fruits and veggies."}
{"text":"Willy Street West was my go-to grocery store during the three years I lived in Madison. I loved this place and miss it quite a bit. Selection in all departments was outstanding. The produce section especially was fantastic. Nearly everything was organic and they did a great job highlighting what was local. Just be careful of their produce sales-usually if it was one sale it was because it was a day away from turning bad. There is a small section of conventional products as well as discounted produce that is no longer fresh-great for things like overripe bananas for baking.

They have a great selection of bulk items. Watch for their sale of Kickapoo coffee beans in the bulk bins-such a great way to save on high quality beans. Excellent cheese counter too. One issue I had with this location is that there wasn't always a cheese monger staffing the cheese counter. Sometimes it was someone filling in from the deli or something and they couldn't answer questions or give recommendations. I can't recall his name but there was one guy who worked the cheese counter who LOVED talking about cheese and was always super helpful. They also miss the five star review for the variability in freshness of their prepared foods. Whether it was the cold or hot foods, sometimes they just looked old, dried out and unappealing."}
{"text":"My husband and I always laugh at those who disparage organic, home grown stores like this, as this is what our grandparents and their parents before them grew up on. Before huge factory farms, local farms and organic produce were what this country thrived on, and I love that I can shop and be an owner at a facility that promotes traditional, yet currently \"radical\", ways of eating.

This store is smaller, but I always find everything I need here. When I need my bakery fix (those Greenbush donuts always call to me), or locally produced eggs, and the sometimes hard to find veggie meat alternatives, the Co Op is my one stop shop.

The store is always clean, and the employees are quite possibly the nicest people around. If I didn't already have a full time job, I would try to work here so that Kombucha and a Tofu Cuban would always be within my grasp."}
{"text":"The Co-Op (or \"Coop\" as my husband and I call it) is my favorite place to visit. We buy our coffee there exclusively, and pick up some of the better-looking produce from the discount bin as well. I love the selection of bulk spices, the sales on yogurt, and the hot bar when I need something quick and delicious.

Yes, the prices are higher than Woodmans, but if you're a good shopper, you can make the most out of your limited budget at the Coop. I love it."}
{"text":"Expanded concept on the original concept--expanded meat counter, prepared foods, and beer.

Willy Co-Op concept: Get membership to buy items at the posted prices, enjoy a selection of foods focused on local and organic items, although some conventional items are available too.  Prices are higher than your prototypical big box store, although if you compare the more premium price products (local&organic/sustainable), you'll usually find that the prices are not very out of line.  The monthly co-op newsletter is also another great resources to find deals, including the monthly Wellness Wednesday that has a discount on health&beauty items. 

I feel that this location lacks a little bit of charm compared to the original east side location but I usually make a stop if I'm passing by."}
{"text":"To combat the after effects of a glutinous Christmas and New Years, I join my girlfriend in an annual cleanse.  With the cleanse comes the need for things all things organic, gluten free, cold press juices, etc.  Willy Street is my one stop shop during the cleanse and I am impressed.  The store is not that large but they somehow are able to pack an incredible assortment of produce, etc. in their aisles.  The staff is always uber helpful.  Yes, sometimes it can be a pain to try to navigate around shoppers during a busy time but I am a fan."}
{"text":"Its slice of downtown/ eastside/ trendy  Madison on the west side - pretentious hip douchy cooler than thou vibe but overall good products at decent price. I've only done hot bar, juices, cheese and beverages - but for size / shelf space all have been very good. prices made me wonder why ever gone to whole foods or brennans. breakfast wrap, empanadas and juices fresh made are topnotch!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent store.  I frequent both locations and do 90% + of our grocery shopping at Willy St. Coop.  It's an excellent feeling buying your food from people who truly care about food and your well being.  In my experience the prices are very reasonable, but it can be difficult to compare to traditional supermarkets where the products just don't stack up.  If you compare prices on the same products I think you'll find that the Coop is the same or in many cases less expensive.

Produce, Bulk isle, and the deli are my favorite departments.  The wine and beer selection is pretty nice too... good value wines."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to this store for a long time but somehow it never work out until recently. I really like their emphasis on local, organic products and produce. I was really surprised to find know brands from other stores. Also surprised that their prices are reasonable compared to other local, organic stores in town. Definitely a place I will go again in the near future."}
{"text":"The Willy West location is great. I can always find parking, and the staff are helpful, friendly, and informed about the products they are selling. Although I shop here regularly, I am compelled to write a review because of the consistent excellence of the fresh meat and fish sections (particularly the fish.) 

After moving to Madison from the East Coast, I thought that I would have to give up on buying fresh excellent fish. I was about as happy as I could be. On some fish, the prices are a bit higher than other stores (on some, however, the opposite is true), but the fish are also of a higher quality, so I am happy to pay it.

If I had to make one complaint, it is that at some point in the past year they switched their bagel vendor. The old vendor had better bagels, I wish they'd switch back.

Service: 5/5
Selection: 5/5
Prices: 4/5 (On some items, they aren't competitive. That's fine, I buy those items elsewhere when I need them.)"}
{"text":"This review is really just to say, again, how big a fan I am of this location.  The pricing is fair and there really isn't much guessing about whether your food is local or organic because it's usually both.  I pretty much get all my food from here!

My favorite areas in the store are the produce and the meat.  The meat section is especially special to me because the guys behind there are chock full of recommendations.  I found a killer alfredo recipe, a great fish recipe, and just great convo from the guys that run that section.

The customer service here is great as well!  On a recent trip I found out that they unfortunately do not take American Express.  Because I live in Fitchburg, coming back with a new card was not really a great option for me.  Franchesca, who I believe is a manager here said that I can take the items with me and just give a call back when I get home and have my card.  I doubt Copps or HyVee would have done this.  This store pretty much sums up everything that I could really ask for in a grocery stop shopping experience!"}
{"text":"I joined the coop about 6 months ago because I want to support its business practices, but I'm fed up with the consistently unfriendly and slow workers (at both locations). The products are great, but I dislike feeling like I am inconveniencing an employee when I ask for assistance locating an item or when I order something from a counter. Also, be prepared to wait awhile at the juice bar, even if there is no line (I just waited 12 minutes - after ordering - for a malt)."}
{"text":"My life is but countless \"somedays.\" One someday is that I'll take control of what goes into my body. This should be easy, as long as you're not in prison, but it's not. Every time I go to Willy, it shows me that this someday is indeed possible. Not prison, but clean eating. 

Fresh, quality produce not treated with radioactive materials? Got it. Someday I'll make all my meals with it. Meat and dairy not pumped like an old whore with antibiotics? Got it. Someday, I'll grill and roast and sauté and barbecue only the good stuff. Dry goods, not processed with unpronounceable compounds? Someday... you get it. 

I must also mention the fine selection of beers (HeIneken? F--- that s--t. Pabst. Blue. Ribbon!), wines, friendly staff, great soup, salads, hot buffet, quick checkout lines, cooking/nutrition classes.... 

Yes, someday. Someday I'll find the fountain of youth, and the fountain of youth will be that I did all my shopping here."}
{"text":"Let's get one thing straight. I love Willy Street Co-op East like a child. A child who is older than me, feeds me, gives me good locally grown and produced products and has friendly and helpful people who work in them... Okay, this analogy is admittedly not so good. Moving on. 

Positive commentary about the original Co-op aside, going to West is a whole other level of co-opy awesome. They've got a huuuuuge selection of produce (lots more exotic, gorgeous, fresh stuff than at East). They've got more cool vegan stuff (curry lentil hummus wiggity what?) and more fermented drinks ('cuz I know you all sprint out for kombucha and kvass on the daily). They have some really nice, big freezer space and lots of samples! I went there to get lunch and basically filled up on samples alone. I mean I took just one or two, because I'm not a little kid or anything....

The hot bar area is enormous and they have loads of pre-packaged grab-and-go stuff. Oh... and did I mention...

BOOOOOZE. Beer and wine! Lots of good stuff. A+ in my book!"}
{"text":"After living near the east side Co-op for years, I was hesitant to migrate to the west side when I moved.  I'm very happy with the west side location and now find it a better experience than the east side.  There's more space in the store making it less hectic and packed.  With more space the food bar is better. I'm a regular of the vegetarian hot items.  They've now added all the tofu varieties in the deli from the east side location. That was huge for me as a dedicated vegetarian.  And the deli staff is always friendly and helpful.  Also with the west side location, parking is much better. It can be tight at times with the other businesses in the complex.  But I can always find a spot."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Wow, they do such an amazing job here! They really go out of their way to label everything and keep the public informed about their inventory. I was so impressed with the variety. The produce section seemed to feature all organic foods. I really enjoyed the option to grind your own fresh almond butter!

Best of all, it's not a corporate company and anyone can be a member/owner and get involved in what's going on and current news! I loved coming here and it's the only place I shop while in the area."}
{"text":"Great selection of real, non-processed food. Natural, chemical free health & beauty products. Chemical free cleaning products. Fun little gift items throughout the store. There's always hot organic food ready to eat in the cafe section. Excellent selection of cheese and wine. Employees are super nice. Twice I had to exchange items and they were happy to help me."}
{"text":"We have been members of Willy Street for a few years now and it was money well spent. When I can't find things at my local grocery I know they will have it at \"Willy\". The biggest reason to shop there is the staff. They are very friendly and knowledgeable. They will go out of their way to answer any questions you may have. I think they are the only place in town to buy Kerrygold butter if that is something you enjoy. I have very sensitive skin and have to buy a fairly expensive shampoo. They always have it in stock and their price cannot be beaten. The store is well organized and clean. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great dairy, spices, bakery, wine selection, vegetables and fruit."}
{"text":"Not much here. From what I understand, this is a second location of a Madison institution that just opened. It's a Co-op, if you are a member, you can save some money, if you just wander in like me, because you are bored, you end up paying more. Oh well. I went here on the same morning I went to Metcalfe's.

I like this place better than Metcalfe's. In fact, if I lived here, I would prefer to shop here, the products are more appealing, they are focusing on Madison items, and if you shopped at Whole Foods, Trader Joe's and then the Co-op, who needs Metcalfe's? They better keep that free paper going or there is no reason for them.

Anyway, the Co-op sold bread from the Madison SourDough Company. They sold Sprech...(??) some kind of local root beer. They had fresh pasta, they sold Bell and Evans chicken and turkeys. They had some fresh bagels, their cheese selection appeared to be well stocked.

Apparently, everything in Madison has to be done in duplicate. If the east side or downtown has one, there has to be one on the west side. I still haven't figured out why, since it takes you five minutes, maybe ten in traffic to drive from one end of Madison to the other, but in keeping the tradition alive and well, the Will Street Co-op has obliged and opened its west location. Enjoy it."}
{"text":"Hello, I think I'm in love!
This co-op is by far the best I have been to. The selection of food is great! I was blown away by the amount of vegan selections available, from the bakery to the deli. Having a vegan grilled cheese on a dairy free grill made my day. The staff is so friendly and helpful. I wish the co-op in Tucson was like this one."}
{"text":"I love this location of Willy Street Co-op! I also adore the bounty of parking spots. 

To begin with, I love organic fruits and vegetables which they have plenty of! They also have organic and conventional bulk nuts, granola, and other grains. In addition, they have my favorite Greek Yogurt which is Wallaby's. They also have a nice selection of wines, beers, and cheeses to choose from. I also throughly enjoy the fact they have healthier versions of potato chips and snack food which taste the same. 

The only downfall I have with the Willy Street Co-op is the fact that the things are slightly more pricey. I could buy a weeks worth of groceries and drop $150. If it wasn't for my parents helping me out, I probably would come here on occasion."}
{"text":"I get a full bowl at the hot and cold salad/eal bar at the Middleton Willy Street a couple times a week.  It is a godsend. You get dozens of different greens/reds/yellows  colors/flavors/textures  salads/casseroles/condiments  (and that would be similar to the Whole Foods hot/cold bars in many cities, except that in other cities the Whole Foods tend to have vastly more extensive salad bars with vastly imaginative offerings than in Madison, where the Whole Foods hot bar is more like the cafeteria at an old age home - - huge slop pans of blandness).

The concept of upscale salad choices/garnishes/condiments is brilliant - - you get such a broad palette of tastes, textures, vitamins and minerals that a full-bore visit is probably nutritionally equal to the rest of the food you eat for the entire week all put together.

And the Middleton Willy Street Coop version is remarkable for their creative kitchen.  The salad choices will power you up just fine and get you cookin' on vites & mins aplenty,  but their hot food creations are something to be grateful for.  Curries, imaginative mex-dishes, cajun thingies - - it's a feast.

What I do is pile salady thingies into a bowl,  then take one semi-hefty spoonful of all the hot things that look good,  and place them around the edge of the bowl.  When you go to a restaurant, you generally have to choose one item on the menu, but here you get every item on the menu - - but it's like going to a brewpub, and getting a line of tasters - -  you get a satisfying bit of everything,  and it is all very well prepared.  They do not skimp on the spice, They produce very good hot main courses (better at lunch, when it is more piping fresh, than dinner, when it has been out for a while)."}
{"text":"The Seafood Center in Middleton's Willy Street Coop is phenomenal! Just picked up diver scallops there and they were super fresh and delicious. They were not soaking wet, like in most grocery stores. The price paid was SO WORTH it (~$26/lb). Plus the counter guy was very kind and helpful. He'll tell you what's fresh that day....listen to him."}
