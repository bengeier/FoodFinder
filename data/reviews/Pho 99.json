{"text":"Excellent place to have authentic vietnamese in cleveland area. I had \"bun thang ha noi\" is so good and they prepare like ha noi style which i was very impressed, normally you will find this style in Ha Noi vietnam. I will definitely be back and would recommend anyone to try. Also, the place is clean and excellent service."}
{"text":"the restaurant remind me of the california style, using umbrella outside the area. the food is excellent, much better any Pho in the Cleveland area. love the summer roll. the portion is much larger at a very affordable price. Plenty   of free parking and dont have to park on the street."}
{"text":"Very good pho, probably my #3 place after Superior Pho and Minh Anh, but really all three are right up there.  Cleveland needs more good pho places."}
{"text":"Thats right.  I do this sparingly, but I'm thrown' out the 5 star.  I just really liked this place.  It was empty.  They need the love hug of a five star.

I actually came upon Pho 99 while looking for Superior Pho (thats right, poke your fun, I'm an eastern suburbs boy...I know my way around street names like \"South Woodland,\" and \"Lander,\" but at this point not as well around the \"Superior\" and \"Saint Clairs\" of the world.  I'm learning.  I mean give me a break--I haven't lived in this city since I learned how to drive, or my mommy let me go places on my own.  Ask me about Mayfield Heights...I'm your man.

Anyhow--walked in with a bit of skepticism.  There was no one here.  It was super clean.  There were no number plaques on the table.  It didn't smell like Pho.  In short it was not your typical Phoexperience.  But hell, I thought.  I am hear, and its raining outside so I might as well stay.

The Pho is all I got, and it was great.  The broth is different then most Pho I have eaten, but still delicious.  Lighter, but not less flavorful,  I don't think they have it wrong and the others have it right, they just have it different.  The noodles were great.  I noticed someone commented about them that they were not the \"right\" noodles...perhaps they have changed them, but mine were banh pho noodles--the noodle for which the dish was named.  The were cooked just right.  And the meat, oh the meat.  The brisket was a plenty, delicious, and large, and there was some flank in there which was also great and abundant.

So hurray!  Stop by, try it out, see what you think.  I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been wondering how Pho 99 food was for the longest time, and today we tried the Pho and Hu Tieu w/ broth on the side.  Hu Tieu was on the special.  Both items were really good.  I can't seem to think which Pho place is better,... superior or Pho 99, there's so competition.  Pho 99 has only a few items on their menu, I think their specialty is Pho.  My fiance thinks Pho 99 is better than Superior, but I think it all depends on people's palates.  I say both of them are good and I can go to either one.  I just happen to go to the asian market and was like,.... I'm hungry, lets try this place out.  The broth bowl for Pho was huge, but I agree with other yelpers that they give you less meat, but thats fine with me, I don't like to eat alot of the meat anyway, I'm a fan of the broth, noodles and fresh veggies.  I'll be back and want to try their other items, too!!!  Oh and the service was great, quick and they refilled our waters promptly which is always a bonus!"}
{"text":"Pho 99 is a great way to end a trip to Cleveland's Asian Town Center.  Living in Mentor, it's a bit of a haul so it's an occasional treat.  Last time I had the Pho Tai and an iced coffee.  Delicious and affordable."}
{"text":"Pho 99 is graced with a nifty logo, decent parking, an edgy menu and relatively brisk service.

I actually like the broth to Pho 99, it's lighter and the balance of flavours is actually pleasing to my palate.  Not a fan of the white chocolate vietnamese coffee.  Portions are a little smaller, but reasonable for the price.

I think it gives the other Pho places a decent counterpoint to their respective styles.

Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"Pho 99 is going to give superior pho a run for its money.

Ditto to what everyone else has said about the broth! It's really really good. My friend said he could taste a lot of the flavors in the broth without a strong basil taste at other restaurants. (I on the other hand, like the basil-heavy broth flavor.) They're a little pricier than superior pho but not by much.

They only serve pho, 2 rice dishes, and a few apps. Looking forward coming back!! 

Owner is pretty cool. We had a little bit of trouble communicating with the server but the owner got our message across.

How funny is it that there are 3 pho restaurants on one street within 2/10 of a mile? You have #1 pho, pho 99...haha."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Superior Pho but I was open to trying this new pho place. Located in the Asian Town Center, this place had all nice furniture. All bamboo tables, chairs, floors, felt like I was in California for some reason. The place was empty but I didn't mind because then that means I get my food quick. I ordered what I always order at Superior to compare and the broth was light so not as heavy as Superior. I liked it but I wasn't wowed by it either. Maybe I'm use to eating the soups that my grandma always makes. Very homey and comfy. So I guess that's what I feel whenever I eat the pho at Superior. It feels like my grandma made it. It gives the feeling of ah. Don't get me wrong, the pho at pho 99 is good but not to my liking. It's probably definitely healthier since you probably won't have food coma after."}
{"text":"Dear Pho 99,

Consider this my application to live in the back corner of your restaurant. I solemnly promise to shower, limit my snoring during business hours, and to not scare the other patrons.

XOXO,
Jennifer



In all seriousness, I arrived at Pho 99 looking like a mess. I had just gotten done with the Occupy Cleveland march, and I was sweaty and gross. They probably should have turned me away at the door. 

I got an iced coffee, fresh summer rolls, and Pho with beef flank and tendon. The coffee was perfect, sweet and strong (just like I like my men too!). The summer rolls were crunchy and clean, the hoisin dipping sauce was so close to perfect it was almost mind-blowing. Make it a touch spicier, and it's just like the dipping sauce I make at home.

The Pho. Okay, lemme get this off my chest first. I love Pho. I dream about it, I judge all of my friends by their like/dislike of Pho, and I will stop dating a man who judges me for my Pho-addiction. I have eaten Pho from what I think was a converted hot-dog cart, and I've eaten Pho in upscale joints that easily wiped out a paycheck.

Pho 99's Pho.....kicks ass. I don't know what the rest of these hooligans are talking about when they say Superior Pho is better. First and foremost, Pho 99 is clean, their broth is deep and rich with a velvet mouth-feel and not overly salty/seasoned, and the tendon (the only part I really care about) is phenomenally gelatinous and gooey.

The only downside is that I didn't get a bubble tea. And now I wish I had. But there is always next weekend!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  So after my first visit right after Pho 99 Opened, I have been back multiple times to enjoy the food in combination with Shopping trips to Asia Food Company.  I'm adding a star compared to my original review 7 months ago as the all-important Pho is even better the last couple times I ordered it.  The \"Large\" now seems more plentiful in terms of noodles, broth, beef, and flavor.  Filling and Tasty.  And that is what food is all about!  Hungry for some now...  :D"}
{"text":"Stars: 4-

Pros: The broth. Tasty. Light. best of all it is NOT heavily ladened with spice.
See? thats an off-rhyme
The broth for Pho should not depend on spice to carry its flavor, imo. 

Delicious and in good portion. 8 for a regular and 9 for a large bowl (something like that).

This place is better than Superior Pho in terms of the Pho (quality of broth and noddles) and the cleaniness/environment of the restaurant. The meat however, is not as good as Superior Pho in terms of quality and quantity. 

Cons:
The menu items are somewhat lacking. Besides the Pho (which comes with combinations of 6 various slices of meat), there are only a few apps and rice dishes. BUT you are here for the Pho, right? ;D"}
{"text":"I am always sad to see this place empty and devoid of customers.  

This place is good! the broth is flavorful, the noodles chewy and aplenty...and they have one thing that Superior doesn't...TENDON!  Yum.  Slightly more $$, but not by much and the service is SOOOO much better.

Everyone is going to keep going to Superior, but I think this place is worth checking out if you like a bit more attention from your waiter, slightly nicer decor...and some chinese groceries at the end :D"}
{"text":"Pho 99 is a small, with 10 tables, but attractive and clean place. It is located in the Asian Town Center. The Pho is good, not great, with plenty of meat, served in a large deep porcelain bowl with the usual accompaniments of basil, lime, sprouts, and sliced jalape√±o. The Banh Mi was served on warm crusty French bread with pate, pork and ham, this was one of the better Banh Mi I have had in this city. The menu is a simple basic Vietnamese noodle shop menu, with emphasis on good Pho."}
{"text":"Wow, a place with great Pho that is almost as good as Superior Pho. Like all reviews, what REALLY makes this place good is 1) the broth and 2) cleanliness. 

The broth at Pho99 is soooo delicious and very smooth. However, one of the reason I might still pick Superior Pho over Pho99 is because of the price. I really can't say which Pho tastes better- superior or 99, but I can say superior pho is cheaper and because of that, I will probably go to Superior Pho alittle more often.

Nonetheless, Pho99 is a must try because this place is delicious!!! YAY to new Pho Restaurants!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Great food and good quality ingredients. The service may vary quite a bit but you will always feel like coming back. The place is bit noisy on weekends when busy"}
{"text":"Pho was ok. It about a b plus on a grade scale. The broth was a little watery and the noodles a bit hard and they didn't give u much. The beef rounds didn't taste that fresh. It was still ok though."}
{"text":"This is a relatively new (opened in summer 2011) pho place located in the Asian Town Center (building with the purple signs and the cheaper supermarket).  I shied away from this pho place at first because they were handing out advertisements for their pho and the noodles in the picture looked like udon noodles instead of pho noodles (!!!).  I've tried this place since then, and, much to my relief, their noodles are real pho noodles.  The prices are comparable to the other two pho places in Asia Town, and this place is open later.  

As for the broth, I'll just say that it's a different combination of spices from Superior Pho's.  For me, their broth paled in comparison to Superior Pho, with something in the broth giving it an off taste in my opinion.  A couple of my friends actually liked the broth better though, so I would suggest that pho connoisseurs who venture into Cleveland try this place in addition to Superior Pho and judge for themselves.

The service is slightly slower than Superior Pho's but still pretty efficient overall."}
{"text":"The service is good. The menu is simple. They really need to time fast to work out the bugs. We ordered the Country Salad Rolls, oho and Vietnamese coffee. The food is ok. The summer roll has pork and its fairly dry, also they must have added the pig skins in it along the lettuce and mint. The fish sauce dipping sauce is a little strong. The pho broth is not even close to Superior Pho. Its beefy but lack of that sweet aroma of spices like cinnamon, star anise and other secret spices. The meat is good. Just the lack of the Chinese celery in the soup when presented. The side condiments presented had some nice bean sprouts, basil, lime, culantro and jalapenos. The other disappointment is the coffee. It lacks the strong roasted coffee and not enough sweet condensed milk.

Give it time. I guess that pot of Pho broth need some TLC time to develop a good flavor. I hope they will be able to make adjustment and changes.

Next day, I had to go to Superior Pho for a proper Pho and Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"Pho 99 is a great place for pho, but not as good as Superior Pho.

The soup is milder though still delicious. The noodles at Pho 99, however, might even be better than those in Superior Pho; they are more chewy in a good way. 

BUT pho is more expensive here. Small is around $7.50 and large around $8.50. 

Superior Pho is the place to go for me, but Pho 99 is worth a visit to see for yourself."}
{"text":"Go, pho, go! Mmmmmmm...definitely a YUM. I had heard from others that a new pho restaurant had opened, so I grabbed some coworkers and off we went to Pho 99. 

What a convenient location. Hidden away in Asian Town Plaza- it sits right outside the Asia Food Co grocery store. Why, how convenient- you can grocery shop and grab dinner! Glorious.

The broth at Pho 99 is quite good. It's lighter than the other pho places in CLE, and it's super flavorful...and just good. Nice and light- and super flavorful. They had three specials of the day, and I and one of my coworkers ordered the first two specials: the banh mi sandwich and hu tieu nam vang. 

The hu tieu nam vang was soooo good. It came with the clear rice noodles (a little thicker than the thin Chinese clear noodles), squid, shrimp, and bbq pork...and that broth. Man, that broth was good. Usually, I don't even finish the broth because most broths are filled with MSG and what not...but not at Pho 99! Yay!! Finally. The banh mi was also really good as well.  

My other coworkers ordered the #1: pho with all the different types of meat. I tried the broth of theirs....and yes, once again, it was good. The sizes were a good size- not too big, not too small. So definitely a go for the pho! We did try the spring and summer rolls beforehand as well...I wasn't too big of a fan of the summer roll, but they liked it.

And an added plus...they had an avocado drink!!! MMMMMM. I had first tried an avocado drink through my Indonesian friend....and loved it....and once I saw it on the menu for Pho 99, I just HAD to try it...and yes, once again it was good. mmmm.

Definitely a go. Go, Pho 99, go!"}
{"text":"I love pho! And this place is where I tried it for the first time. So delicious and the people who run it are very nice and accommodating. I went to Superior Pho a couple times, but I honestly like this place better. The broth is just a little better and they also have thai tea!"}
{"text":"Wow, this broth is fantastic-- it needed nothing (although there are bottles of sriracha, another hot pepper  paste and hoisin on the tables).  The problem was that while the price was higher than Superior Pho, the bowls were smaller and there was far less meat in the bowl-- only a few small slices.  And it was salty-- but take that opinion with a grain of salt (hah!) because I like only the most minuscule amount.

Still, despite that, I would go back again and again for the lovely taste of the broth, and the fantastic, attentive service.

The banh mi (a special) was really great.  The bread was an airy, incredibly crispy baguette , or more of  large epi bread roll.  The pate was delicious and very evident-- not a thin smear.  The pork was good and the jalapenos were hot.  OK, another tiny complaint-- I would have liked more pickled veggies.  There were only a few  strips.

The sudden profusion of pho places in town can only be a good thing.  Soon Clevelanders will be able to go to California and write snotty yelp reviews saying \"Oh well, the pho was OK-- for California.  But, I'm from Cleveland where we know good pho.\""}
{"text":"The restaurant is inside the Asian Town Center. It's very small with about 6 tables. No matter which viet restaurant we go to, my man always orders pho. He says the pho portion is smaller, yet it's competively priced. I had the rice with pork chop combo.... the meatloaf cake thing that comes with it was definaltely nuked because the top was rubbery. The pho was good, the rice was okay. 

 The menu is limited to mainly pho, rice, and staple apps.

On the plus side, you can go food shopping or grab some pastries at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Yumm!! Love Pho, which is unfortunately hard to find, especially on the East Side where I live. So I was overly excited to find the Asian Plaza and this wonderful little Pho place.
It's authentic and tastes great.
Wish they had the seafood Pho on the menu; that would be my only criticism."}
