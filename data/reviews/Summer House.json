{"text":"Their Curry combos are so good! Big portion and comes with fresh salad and soup! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing and tasty Filipino food.  We order from summer house all the time because the food is delicious and you can't beat the pricing! My favorite is the deep fried spicy shrimp and bbq chicken. The dipping sauce is what makes theses dishes so great.   The chef is so friendly and his staff are amazing people as well.  Their customer service is great.   We ordered large party trays for take out last minute and the chef didn't turn us down.  He kindly took our order and even delivered it to our home.  I was so pleased! Thank you so much summer house!"}
{"text":"New Filipino Restaurant in the neighbourhood, they've been here for almost a year! Good food, authentic filipino cuisines! They're best sellers are Lechon Kawali (fried pork belly) and Yang chow Fried Rice!! Affordable cost!! They also do party trays!!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and was looking for authentic Filipino food... found it here at the Summer House.   Although the place was busy on a Friday night, the food came out quickly and the service was fantastic. The hostess (/waitress/busperson) was very attentive and did a great job juggling multiple tasks.   Only reason I did not give it a full five was location. This has nothing to do with the great service or food."}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem since the other popular filipino restaurant in downsview had a long wait. The place is tucked hidden in the end of the plaza complex. Decor a bit old but do not let the look deceived the most homey filipino food i've ever had in toronto. They have the most amazing garlic fried rice,sinegag, grilled squid and their pork (both their crispy pork and their pork belly) are just YUM!!! Their cheese wonton is so addictive too!! They do delivery too up all the way to yonge and finch. The only place to go if you are looking for filipino food!"}
{"text":"Food is great and the service is always friendly. I always order trays of cheese wontons for parties :)"}
{"text":"The best authentic Filipino food in town!! My little niece's birthday came around and it was so last minute that we decided to throw a party at our house. It was on short notice, but Summer House took my order and the food was sooooo tasty. Party tray starts under $30, and every tray came in huge portion!! We ordered Yangzhou Fried Rice, crispy shrimp, and of course their famous cheese wonton. Thanks for your support of a great party!  Say \"Cheese\"!"}
{"text":"The cheese wontons are soooooo good. They make them fresh and don't get them from a supplier or anything.   I got the general tso chicken and found it ok. I like mine to be crispy and spicy, but this was more on the sweet side and a bit soggy. I'll be back for the cheese wontons and I'll probably try another entree. Really friendly atmosphere! I'm sure their Filipino food is bomb!"}
{"text":"Inconspicuous little place with polite customer service.  Located in my hood in an unassuming strip plaza.  I am blown away by the quality of food at this little place!  When one least expects it ... life throws you a good surprise!!   The pancit canton is amazing.  Saw some other people order vegetable-based dishes and it was clear that these ingredients are quality.  Nice pleasant quiet vibe.  Nice owners.  Wow!!!!!!  Fresh food!!!!!!  Will definitely be back.  They have some of my favourite dishes with belacan - lots of S.E. Asian and Chinese fare.  Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Summer House is a mix of Filipino, Thai and Chinese food. The restaurant is located around the north east corner of Bathurst / Sheppard Ave. Didn't have issues with parking as we were there late on a Sunday.   We ordered the...  Fried Cheese Wonton (12 pcs) - $ 5.95 This was awesome! I could eat this all day. The cream cheese was so good and it came in a great size. I recall the chain Spring Rolls having something like this except they are smaller and would charge an arm and leg. Highly recommended.  Lechon Kawali (pork belly) - $14.95 I don't really like pork or pork belly to start off with so this is already a bit biased. The skin was nice and crunchy. It comes with two sauces. It was annoying to get rid of the huge fat layers between the crunchy skin and meat. Too much effort to eat this. This dish was mainly for my husband.   Thai Curry Fried Rice - $ 10.25 Very tasty and the large was a good size. We had to pack half home. Next time we'll get the smaller size.   Mix Veggies - $ 6.96 It had broccoli, beans, corn, carrots, etc. Can't go wrong there.   5% off if you check-in / post on FB or Instagram. Free delivery if it's over $40"}
{"text":"Been on the hunt for some authentic Filipino food, and came across this place. Seems like a family owned restaurant, with many of the local folk joining us on this evening.   Place is a bit on the small side, and not really about the atmosphere. The staff were on the quiet side, but prompt with their service.   The menu seemed to actually be a mix of Filipino, Thai, and Chinese. We hoped to try something new, but ended up having dishes very similar to the Chinese ones we have quite often (e.g. curry fried rice and mixed veggies). The Lechon, as expected, was on the fatty side, but nice and crispy as I like it. The star of the meal however was the Crispy Fried Wonton dish - I have seen more expensive and less tasty versions of this elsewhere, so this was exciting to us.  We may come back, and try to be a bit more adventurous with our choices."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with my visit to summer house and that is due to the front house service I was given... I frequent this restaurant with my girlfriend and we both enjoy the food (Vegetable Sinigang and Dinner for Two combo).  The service was good before but has gotten much worse.  I was craving some Filipino food and found myself wanting to order from Summer House; I seated myself and waited 5 minutes before being given a menu.  There were 2 waitresses and one of them kept hiding out in the back kitchen area while the other was serving other guests ( who looked like they were waiting for a long time to be served).    I waited another 5 minutes and just had about enough before walking out.. way to drop the ball guys... I love the food here but the service just sucks now and maybe I will try again in the future... thankfully my girlfriend was not with or she would have thrown a tantrum..."}
