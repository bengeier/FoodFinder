{"text":"It's an airport bar so I expect crowds, high prices and not much else.  Well this place had a wind that would go through it that smelled like sewer.  There were other places to purchase liquid courage at the airport and I suggest you try them prior to settling down at this place."}
{"text":"Prices are high, but it's an airport bar so what do u expect. The bartender was really nice with a funny personality. It's a very casual atmosphere with sports on the tvs. It's only 1 of 2 bars in Terminal 1 that allow smoking. This one is located in the B gate section and the only other is located in the C gate section. Cigarette smoking is allowed for paying patrons only. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to stop and have a quick beer and smoke."}
{"text":"Holy crap! They advertised an American mule on the board outside. I figured it would be good. Turns out it's not a bad drink but it cost me $19.24. Yeaaaah no. This isn't 'da club."}
