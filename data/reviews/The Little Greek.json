{"text":"While visiting my mother in No.Las Vegas, we had taste for Greek food. In the California Bay Area we have some pretty good Greek restaurants. So of course we were looking for some tasty gyros. The Little Greek is right down the street from moms so we thought we'd give it a try. OMG....it was great! Very tasty gyros and the Greek salad was good and fresh. And an extra added bonus, the falafels are excellent. We will eat here every time we come to town. This is now one of our favorites.
Ps The lady that took our order was super nice and understanding....making a big effort communicating with my deaf son."}
{"text":"OMG the gyros here are AMAZING!!!! By far this is the best gyros restaurant in Vegas, and it's right in my backyard. No longer do I have to travel for subpar gyros. The owners are very friendly and talkative, they really connect with their customers. We will soon be on a first name bases, cause I plan to be here a lot. The only minor compliant I have, is that there isn't anywhere to seat while they prepare your food...like I said its minor."}
{"text":"I went there today for the first time. The owner was really inviting and nice. Food is excellent! I will be eating here more."}
{"text":"Great gyros. Finally in my area......everything I've had was excellent   Hummus w/warm pita bread is the best. Try this great place....warm and friendly people.  Best gyro I've ever had mmmmmmmm I'm hooked for sure................I, along with several friends, back up this AWESOME food  review"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!The Gyro is delicious with a tender and really well seasoned meat. I will come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious, I came here for lunch one day out the blue and BAMM..! Great food; the meat was perfectly seasoned and piled high (great portions). The staff was extremely polite and the place has a real HOME feel to it..! Can't wait to come back..."}
{"text":"Good gyros good sauce  nice people very clean nice place to puck up on the go or lunch for thr office try it you will like."}
{"text":"The Gyros is so so delicious,  and the potatoes was the bomb. The Greek hostess was so nice to us, I will definitely  go back, again, and again, and again, 10 stars for good Greek food, and very  friendly  service. GREAT FOOD.."}
{"text":"I stumbled on this little gem when I was in the area. Being a sucker for Greek food I stopped in and discovered that they have some of the best Gyros I've had in a long time. The ingredients taste fresh and you get a decent portion for what you pay. I would highly recommend you stop by here if you're in the area. :)"}
{"text":"I always appreciate when someone puts their heart and soul into the quality of food they cook and serve to others. This place is very new, and in one of those spots you stumble upon, but if you're looking for authentic Greek food from the heart, check this place out. You can taste the love Mona, who owns the place, and her \"cousin\" put into the food. My boyfriend was grubbin' on the Philly cheesesteak he got, and loved it even more dipped in the homemade tzatziki sauce. I can tell because he wouldn't stop moaning. I'm a huge fan of tzatziki, it's hard to find someone who makes it like I like it, but she's definitely got my taste buds happy. I got the fava beans and pita bread with the tzatziki. She even brought out the fava beans for me to taste to see if It needed any more salt or spice to my liking. Check it out if you're on the north side! There's not many places that serve food from the heart in this part of town."}
{"text":"This place has definitely  been over rated. Poor ac, long wait and we were the only ones there. I ordered a gyro and a side of hummus. The gyro meat was previously cooked then reheated and burnt on the grill, very little amounts of onion and tomato. I got a delicious tub of hummus that seemed like 2 lbs and 1 piece  or pita for two people."}
{"text":"This restaurant just disgusted me. Its located in the food court of East York Mall. I called to find out whether the restaurant was halal or not. The employee was very rude to me on the phone and said \"I don't understand what you want to know. I guess its halal there is a sign?\" I further responded saying well I need to know if its halal and after a few seconds he then said it was not halal, got very upset over the phone and told me to call back when the manager was here and he hung up the phone on me. Very bad customer service and to top it off all those Muslims in the area are probably being tricked into believing its halal. Boycott."}
{"text":"Live close by and decided try it out.  I had the Gyro Works and it was delicious!  Definitely going back :)

Also, you can tell the owners take alot of pride in their work and provide amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"The gyro was one of the best  I've ever had.  The bread was moist, the meat flavorful and the sandwich wasn't greasy. Loved it!"}
{"text":"So delicious. My favorite is the greek salad with gyro meat. I'm so happy to have this in my area."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  Everything was fresh and delicious. Definitely the best gyro I've had here in Las Vegas!  The owner and staff were awesome as well, excellent customer service!  I'm glad we found this hidden gem in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Pergo makes amazing food and has a wonderful personality. I now live in Alberta, but the second I visit Ontario, all I can think of it eating the chicken schnitzel from the Little Greek. It is freshly made and incredibly savory. I know it's small, and in a food court in Thorncliffe, but it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly service, and very affordable. I had never tried Mediterranean food before and I absolutely love the food here! My favorite item on the menu is their Baklava. I will forever be a regular customer here."}
{"text":"Walked in and the two ladies working were welcoming. Quiet place. Got our food quickly, it was delicious. Gyros were BOMB. Sides of potatoes were yummy. Baklava awesome, flakey and so rich. Glad we found this hidden gem!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The price is very reasonable it is in a food court so best to get take away. With these prices and quality no other place can beat it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The gyro's are super delicious. I got the Zeus and the meat was a perfect mix of outside crispy with middle soft meat. It was like having gyro bacon meat with regular gyro. Perfect! If you don't want the slightly crispy meat just let her know. But i highly recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"great food and great people no questions asked!!! thank you mona ... dirce r....."}
{"text":"Poor service.  I'm in a wheelchair and they took advantage of me. Only half of my order. Seriously thinking of calling the better business Bureau for profiling me"}
{"text":"Tried the other night food was good a little over done on cook top with gyro meat but I didn't mind.  Plenty of food will try again.  Not the greatest but the best I have had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The gyros taste awesome it comes with lots of meat. The only thing I didn't care for was the drinks. $2 for a 16oz bottle of water and $1.75 for a small can of soda so no refills. If it wasn't for the drinks I would have given 5 stars"}
{"text":"Flavorful Gyro, friendly service... 4 stars due to being a little pricey and no Spanakopita..."}
{"text":"My wife was chatting with the owner today (a lovely lady) who was saying that, if business doesn't pick up, by September, she may have to close her doors for good.
Now, just so you know, when it comes to food, my wife is the toughest lady on the planet to please. So if, like us, you love this place, get the word out. 
Let people know about this place. 
Get your lunch and/or dinner from there more frequently, or we could lose a real gem."}
{"text":"Hooray! A new gyro place closer to home.  I had the gyro with sauce and tomato only, no onion or feta.  The meat was good quality and tasty!  The sauce was yummy, I think the pita was homemade but not sure, it wasn't firm or chewy, like store bought, but was more soft and doughy, it did break apart toward the end though. I highly recommend this place, we needed one!

{"text":"Went there to grab something to eat. AC isn't working. They were selling chocolate, I bought chocolate for my son but the lady seemed more worried about my son sitting on the chair or dirtying it with chocolate. She told me just to put the money on the counter she had to go make some lady's food. Needless to say didn't eat. Bought chocolate and juice and will never return. Don't put furniture in your restaurant if you don't want paying customers with kids to sit on it with fear of dirtying it with what your selling!"}
{"text":"If I was able to give less than 1 star, that's what The Little Greek would garner. Absolutely terrible experience. I'd love to review the food, but since I just had to throw it away, I have no clue what it tastes like. 

I walked in to find 2 couches and no tables...OK take out only, not a problem I was carrying food home anyway. From the kitchen, a lady (presumably the owner) welcomed me and told me the menu was next to the cash register. I found green Xerox copies of a simple menu next to the Ipad she us us for a register. When I was ready to order, the lady never came out to the front counter, she stayed in the kitchen and took my order from the window. 

My order was simple...3 gyros with sauce and feta only, 1 Greek salad with gyro meat. She said it would take \"a minute\". I asked if I had time to run to Albertsons across the street, she said \"it will be ready when you get back.\" When I returned, I learned my salad had been given to another customer. I didn't have time to wait for it to be remade so I asked for just the sandwiches. The gentleman working on the kitchen said the sandwiches she grabbed for me were for a call in customer. She ignored him and rang me up. 

Initially she said $25...for 3 gyros!! When I questioned the price, she rerang them and said $22. A dollar savings, but hey since the yelp reviews were good, I figured it was worth it. I just got home to find that the sandwiches were WRONG. Not surprising since they weren't for me. When I tried calling the restaurant, my call went to Mona's (presumably the owner) personal voicemail...how unprofessional. I left a message and have yet to get a return call. My child is allergic to the onions on the gyro, she literally could have died!!!

Needless to say, I will not be returning. I suggest Mona pay more attention to her staff when they try to give her important information. $22 and we're eating peanut butter and jelly. Thanks Mona and The Little Greek for adding another Don't Visit spot to the list!"}
{"text":"First of all let me say that there ARE several tables to eat at.  I would give the organic chicken greek salad a 5 star because it was delicious, large and packed a lot of flavor. The reason I am giving it a 3 is because when you walk in, you are not even sure it is a place to eat.  There are cases out front to display food, but there is NO food displayed.  Just a lot of jewelry, rocks, greek coffee cups and so forth. The sign out front advertises \"BAKERY AND DELI\"  but there were NO pastries being displayed and NO food items. It felt like I walked into a store that sold non-edible items.  
Since I wrote the last paragraph, we have tried three different times to return.  The first time, there was a sign on the door that said, \"sold out.\" and it was closed.  We weren't sure what that meant but we left.  The second time we went,  The next time we went, there was another sign that said, \"Back in 45 minutes.'  Since we weren't sure when they left, we didn't know how long we would have to wait.  The Third time we went was very late in the afternoon... I think maybe around 5 and it was closed for the day.  STRIKE THREE!  And I forgot to mention that a fourth time I tried to call and place a phone order but got a voice mail.  I left a message but nobody called me back.   COME ON!!!  I love greek food and we need a good greek food place in the area but I will starve to death waiting for someone to be there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went in with my friend, and we were greeted by Mona, the owner. She was very friendly and after we ordered she confirmed that we knew what we were getting (we ordered the Gyro Combo) and where her Gyro meat was coming from. She was very quick- it only took about 10-15 minutes to get our food- and we had a great conversation with her. We took our food to Craig ranch park. It was still hot, and it. was. DELICIOUS. It was extremely fresh and the gyro was seasoned so well. We got baklava with ours and it was amazing as well. Overall, great experience, great food, and I absolutely will be going back."}
{"text":"Had the Gyros Works today and it was excellent. Piled high with meat that had excellent flavor and the pita was soft and very good. Had the baklava for desert and it was good also. Will go back when I am on the north side again."}
{"text":"It's a small place but the food is great. The menu is somewhat limited (or specialized, depending how you look at it) but if you love gyros, this is the place to come. 

It's a bit hard to see from the street but it's right across from the Just Brakes shop."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. It has a awesome taste I've been searching for since I left Chicago 3yrs ago. And the customer service is just excellent. I Love It!"}
{"text":"The worst gyro I have ever had. The sandwich had more than half dry overcooked burnt pieces. The worker when called about my disappointment she said she been making these for 15 years and she was not refunding me my money nor exchanging the sandwich and hung the phone up on me. She was rude and has no customer concerns what so ever. Will not go back there. I posted a picture of the burnt pieces."}
{"text":"I would NOT recommend this restaurant to my worst enemy. The customer service here is the worst. I went here about a week ago and waited outside after reading a note posted from the owner stating she had to run to the store...NO problem. She returns, I wait until she unloads her car and then enter. While reviewing the menu she states:
 \"It'll be awhile because I'm not set up\" in a tone of agitation not \"Hello\" not \"thanks for waiting\" nothing.... 
After completing her tasks.. she approached me to order I asked a few questions and settled on the special. 
Upon completion of transaction, there was just attitude in body language and general demeanor she didn't say thanks or anything. 
So, I lead by example and thanked her....
No response. 
I asked for a fork & napkin.
I was passed a fork by her touching the wrong side and 1 single napkin. Ooookkkkaaay. 


No where in the menu did the special state that the meat was pork (I triple checked) and I wasn't made aware of this until I   ordered & paid.  I really did not want to address her again however I literally can not eat a plate of pork. 

I went in re-read the menu & apologetically explained that I couldn't eat it. She cut me off mid sentence and blurted \"I will give you a refund\" OK great however I did actually wait here to eat I'm thinking so I politely asked if I could order salad ...

She denied me service stating that she just would rather not and that she was \"irritated\"  

I certainly would hate to irritate a restaurant owner with a food order.....silly me. 

This was the 2nd time I encountered a displeasant attitude from this woman. The 1st time I dismissed it as a bad day. This time is simply ridiculous. 

I'm never rude, impolite or disrespectful. I did not deserve such blatant nastiness. 

Save your $$ or drive to a greek restaurant with ownership that values customers."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice over the past month and are amazed at how well seasoned everything is. My mouth starts to water just thinking about it. Each visit, Mona greeted us with enthusiasm, and provided exceptional customer service. You can tell she is passionate about the meals she prepares. 

The Greek Salad is to die for and finally olives with no pits. Keep these coming The Little Greek!

Gyros with authentic ingredients. Taste and texture are spot on. Taziki is out of this world! We've only skimmed the surface of the menu, but we intend to take full advantage of it in the near future. While on the subject of Menu; we find it refreshing that The Little Greek has maintained a small Greek only offering rather than a menu full of burgers, pasta, pizza, etc. If I want those things, I'll go somewhere else.

Our family loves this place. Close to home and ample portions. There's always some left over for that \"after dinner\" craving! 

Thanks goes out to The Little Greek. Glad to have you in the neighborhood!

On a side note, for those looking at seating or a place to have a \"sit down\" meal, stay tuned. I recall a notice I saw about next month...there are great things on the horizon for The Little Greek."}
{"text":"Stopped in today was taken care of right away. Ordered a Gyros works and a Balaclava. Price was good and food was very tasty. Will be going back. :)"}
{"text":"So are you looking for the best gyro in Vegas? Maybe of all time? Well, look no further, because it is up in North Las Vegas at a nice little place called The Little Greek. Although they have a limited menu, that works to their benefit. The limited menu allows them to truly specialize in making the best Greek gyro. The gyro meat is tender and tasty. The lady who runs the restaurant says she only uses the best quality meat. The tzatziki sauce is creamy and cool and brings the flavor of the whole gyro together. Their seasoned potatoes are a flavorsome side that complement the gyros. I haven't tried the Greek salad yet, but it looks delicious. That's next on the list to try! They also have a variety of Greek desserts which I have yet to try. But they look yummy!

They also recently added tables so you can dine in. I've been there twice, and I plan to make this a regular restaurant I visit!"}
{"text":"Really good gyros. I loved their iced tea as well. I couldn't pick it what we different about it, but it was really flavorful. I definitely recommend this little authentic Greek place!"}
{"text":"the KABOB IS THE KABOMB!!! i did not expect how juicy and full of flavor it has... i actually forgot what meat it was and it didnt matter coz its that good... i highly recommend this place and the wife and I have just found our new mediterranean spot! Luv it!!!!"}
{"text":"It just opened up down the street from our house and already has become a favorite! My bf and I love their gyros and we got a complementary pastry. I being part Greek myself love stuffed grape leaves and have not found a good place yet until now. Definitely will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious . Had the jumbo gyros works. 
The best flavor balance of any place so far.
Hopefully  the lady puts a big sign out so people can better find the restaurant!"}
{"text":"A little skeptical walking in since it was about lunch time and no one was here...and the glass cabinets in the front are completely barren....but The Greek salad with gyro meat was awesome!! About $9. Not the most personable staff but nice."}
{"text":"I love to support mom and pops shops been coming here since it opened.
Today was the last draw extremely hard to place phone orders and every time the order is wrong I won't be going back wish they had more competent service wish them the best"}
{"text":"Good gyro and tasty potatoes, the baklava was delicious. Check out them pics Cupcake."}
{"text":"The Little Greek is one of the hidden wonders in North Las Vegas. I love the menu and the personal attention the host of this place has with all of her customers.

But I must say that salad dressing Mona puts on her salads is so delicious.

I recommend this place to everyone who lives here and all visitors to Las Vegas.

Invite to all my military brothers you will love this place.

So don't listen to the haters out there and you know who I'm talking about please hate on some other restaurant."}
{"text":"I haven't tried their food, but the pastries are tasty. Nice people too, I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I can't stand this \"cucumber food\" as I call it and anybody who knows me knows that. My wife purchased a yelp deal and convinced me to give this place a try suggesting that I just get a lamb and beef gyro and leave all the cucumber shit off of it. So we walk in and there wasn't even a place to sit and eat and only had take out as an option. Fine but as others came in after us that did phone orders they also mentioned that it was odd there was no type of seating. The owner claims it's because she doesn't have a public bathroom that she can't allow people to eat inside but come on lady! The least you can do is put some bench seating along the bare wall or something to show your customers you care which you clearly don't. And what happened to hair nets? This lady had some long, wild, and crazy thick black hair just flying all over the place yet wasn't wearing a hair net! Disgusting! So the guy working (Nick) kind of gave a hard time about using the yelp deal since the owner had did away with it. I was able to get a refund for the yelp deal but not cool that it couldn't be honored. After placing my order and paying almost $45 the guy tells us they are out of a lot of the ingredients. WTF he just took my hard earned money so how are you going to tell me you now can't prepare my order? He and the owner went back and forth several times giving us waiting customers the runaround about when someone would be back with ingredients to finish the orders. Look at he picture I posted of the meat on the spit and you will see how much meat they had ready for all of us waiting customers and you will see that it's not enough. After waiting too long we got a refund and I told them we'd never be back I mean why would we after that?

My wife posted a review about her experience and the owner has sent her several inappropriate messages saying that she will be investigated and all this complete bullshit that will never actually happen just to intimidate her to delete her review. Not cool of the owner to respond and act that way. The owner responds to yelp reviews which allows anybody reading to see those responses and if you see the way the owner Mona has responded to some then you will see how she truly feels about her business and customers which is not much. I am posting a honest and factual review. I don't care if pictures posted do not reflect what she has changed it to since because what I am writing and posting is about my actual experience at that time which is what yelp is all about, Any response from owner at this point means nothing to me and only hurts her credibility when she shows how she responds and acts to everyone else who reads the reviews."}
{"text":"The gyro I had here is quite possibly the best I've had, ever- and I've had a lot of freaking gyros, trust. The meat is super-tender and flavorful, the pita is perfectly pillowy, and the tzatziki tastes great. They're not stingy about the sauce and feta, either! 

Efficiency needs a little work. Note that the shop has no seating, it's exclusively a grab-and-go counter. I spent 30+ minutes placing and waiting for an order. Two other customers present during my visit came in to pick up a call-ahead order and both still had to wait quite a bit. They've been open two months, so I would think this had been worked out a little better, but maybe they just haven't found their groove yet. Menu is limited, with a few sandwiches, a salad, and options for pastries. Quality is really decent and prices are very fair.

NOTE: They're offering BOGO gyros for their grand opening, so hurry in to take advantage!"}
{"text":"Great food but the owner has terrible customer service skills. Everytime I've ordered she has an attitude. I once witnesses her yelling at the only employee she had working with her. It was very awkward and unprofessional. She's a great cook but definitely NOT a people person. Good luck all."}
{"text":"Such a great little restaurant. Friendly cashier, she greets you soon as u walk through the door. Food is excellent. I ordered the Athena. Meat fresh an extremely full of flavor. Wish they would've gotten a better location because this place is better than most fast food. The potatoes are super tasty.I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a rainy Saturday afternoon. And it was totally worth it. Had 3 sandwiches that were awesome. I totally recommend this place to get your Greek fix."}
{"text":"Little Greek just opened up, very clean, nice atmosphere. The owner, Mona, greets everyone with a smile. Everything here is very fresh, and and made on site. MILITARY FRIENDLY is always a plus."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by to grab a quick bite. The owner was amazing. Makes everything by hand. She was so nice and even gave me a free sample.  This will be my go to spot for the best gyros in north las vegas!"}
{"text":"The best gyros!!!! Been a few times already and haven't been disappointed!!! I have also tried the baklava and it was amazing !!! The owners are really nice. ..."}
{"text":"The sweet tea is really good and the portions are huge! My gyro and hummus was delish! Small place so take out is a safer option during busy times."}
{"text":"Was ok, the meat was in chunks even though I see a meat cone on the cooker. Not so impressed. The pita bread fell apart after one bite. ..a little work and this place could be better."}
{"text":"I checked out this business today and was pleasantly surprised. The gyro was outstanding The meat was cooked perfectly not too much onions nice tomatoes the pita bread was very soft. But what make the sandwich really get five stars is the tzatziki sauce. Also the sandwich wasn't loaded with lettuce that's a West Coast thing I guess. It was  One of the best Gyro's I have had in Las Vegas so glad they are close to me."}
{"text":"Me and my wife stopped in to try it out it was ok but definitely not the best. 
Not sure if it was the sauce or the pita bread that made the bread fall apart. The
People were very nice but could use some work. On the food 
Any how I hope they are successful in their endeavor. 
But I do not believe I will be returning."}
{"text":"Super yummy gyros. Authentic and tasty. The potatoes are fantastic as well. Well worth it."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today food was great reminded me of the food at home. Will be eating there again. Thanks for great food. It's what this valley needs."}
{"text":"Great Gyros!   Stop by for lunch and you won't be disappointed...  We also had Pastitsio which was like a Greek Lasagna but no red sauce.. It was fantastic.  Finished off with Baklava... Sweet and delicious.   New business to the neighborhood, Best of luck... with this food, you probably wont need it though.."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. Spent a while talking with the owner and the guy working with her. Very nice people and the owner seems very passionate about what she's doing. We had Greek salads with gyro meat on them. The dressing, meat, and lettuce were awesome. They were out of tomatoes but we added our own. Unfortunately they forgot the onions and feta so our salads were a little sad, but still delicious and they are still working out the kinks. They should also consider adding kalamata olives to the salads. We also had hummus and homemade baklava. Both delicious. They are still trying to get their feet under them and I have no doubt it will just keep improving. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just drove by this place and decided to stop by. Looks like they are just getting started but the food was good. I would defiantly recommend. I forgot my yelp coupon so the price was a liltle bit on the side, but thats not their fault."}
{"text":"My hubby stopped by after work to pick up some food to surprise me (I am Greek) as we are always wanting to try new places.  He ordered the gyro with a side of Greek potatoes, lentil soup, hummus and a piece of baklava.  

Well, here it goes folks....
The gyro was flavorful, but small and had one tiny piece of tomato, no onions and not enough tzatziki.

The Greek potatoes were extremely undercooked and lacked flavor.  

The lentils were VERY bland and also lacked flavor.  It was too thick and was mixed with rice.

The hummus was \"ok\" at best.  It too, was bland.

The baklava was dry and hardly any nuts.

I cook Greek food at home and consider myself a pretty good cook (and so does everyone who tries it).  I am quite disappointed in this food and hope that people who try it don't think this is how Greek food is supposed to taste.

The only real compliment we can give is to the employee, Bevin, who was very polite and friendly according to my hubby.  So thank you Bevin and thank you for your service in the military."}
{"text":"I usually use yelp to find new places to try.  This one had a good overall rating but after scrolling thru the actual reviews, I found that most seemed fake.  You can tell because they've only reviewed 1-3 establishments and there's no profile picture.  Not sure why owners feel like they have to do that.  If your restaurant is good, let it speak for itself. 

Anyway, I walked in and noticed the lady in the back  which I'm guessing is Mona.  I placed my order with another lady that worked there.  I got my \"works\" gyro pretty fast. Mona placed it in front of me and assumed I was taking it to-go. But I said nah I'm eating it here. She acknowledged my son that was with me and even gave him a little side of potatoes. She told him to sit down and I agreed with her so I told my son to sit down. He wouldn't but he's usually careful anyway.   Almost done with my gyro and I asked Mona for a fork, she gave it to me and said seriously if my son can sit down in the chair because she doesn't want any lawsuits. lol that's when I thought this lady was a little off. This whole time I thought she was just being friendly but she's just worried that someone will sue her for a kid falling off a chair. 

The gyro was good but the free potatoes were undercooked. Thanks anyway, Mona. Probably won't be coming back so you won't have to worry about a lawsuit with your wobbly tables. 

P.S. You should worry about a lawsuit from your employees with that verbal abuse I heard going on in the back while I was waiting for my food.  

P.P.S. Check yourself before you wreck yourself. If you haven't already."}
{"text":"They have really tasty gyros and the stuffed grape leaves were warm and packed a lot of flavor. We also took home some baklava which just came out of the oven and was so warm and the dessert was really good. Highly recommend this place! Great greek food!"}
{"text":"Mona is such a kind giving person.  She cooked food for 70 people on a fire.   I love every single menu item she has.  I really enjoy her food. Its the highlight of my week.  Not to mention how much time she donates to local events   5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"First time I went to this place. Walked in, guy in the kitchen cooking said hello. One customer sitting there, no one at the counter. Stood there for several minutes. Guy cooking never said a word after hello. There was a tablet on the counter, so I thought well, maybe you put your own order in the tablet, so I did. Swiped my card, emailed me my receipt and sat down. Another customer walked in. Finally the guy came out from the kitchen with an order for the guy sitting there. Then he asked if he could help me. I said I had put it in the tablet, he laughed and said to tell him what it was, so I did. He then took the order of customer who came in after me and went back to the kitchen. He mumbled something about \"she will be right back\". Got my food in a reasonable time once he came out, and it was good ( gyro combo and baklava). Just need to make sure either someone is at the counter, or the cook should at least acknowledge that someone will be with you shortly. I will try them again."}
{"text":"I usually prefer to patronize a small shop over a franchise, but the results aren't always positive.  In this case, the little mom and pop gyro restaurant easily beats Gyro Time and others.  The meat seems leaner, healthier, and tastier.  The owner is a sweet lady with a pleasant demeanor and she accommodates my ordering whims, be it onions on the side or extra meat.  I can wolf down one of her gyros with extra meat at lunchtime and not be hungry till the next day.  Although hers have a slightly different taste to it, the gyros compare favorably with the better ones I've found in Chicago and New York."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant! The people are great and my meal was fantastic! I love the \"mom and pop\" feel to the place. My favorite is the \"Zeus\", it is hardy and refreshing. Great decision to go there for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a gyro from! I passed by and decided to get 3 gyros for myself and my family. Service was excellent, gyros were even better. This is probably one of the better gyros I've had in Las Vegas. She threw in a sample of potatoes and feta and I will definitely be ordering a full order of those next time. Everything was delicious and well worth it. I highly recommend the little greek!"}
{"text":"Just so happen to stumble upon this place yesterday and happy I did! Plan on making this my new go to for gyros. Ordered to go, staff was friendly and I have my food within 10 mins. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I walked in. Was barely greeted. The lady was not welcoming at all... I asked her a question an felt like i was bothering her. I walked right out. I refuse to spend my money here"}
{"text":"At first glance it just seems to be another mom and pop gyro shop, but upon entering you are greated by the unmistakable aroma of fresh and well seasoned Greek cuisine. My son and I both ordered the \"gyro works\". No taziki for me please!. First bite, fresh pita, check, delectable gyro meat, check, fresh onions and tomatoes, check. Just a great gyro overall. My son also ordered the stuffed grape leaves, also known as dolmades. They were served warm with a drizzle of lemon juice and olive oil over top. The  rice and ground beef were seasoned perfectly. I recommend this place to all who enjoy Greek cuisine! 10 out of 10 will be back again soon as truly great food is a rare commodity."}
{"text":"Order two gyros with sauce on the side. Had to repeat my order at lease 5 times. My order was so bad I would never  recommend this place my meat was so over cook  like beef jerky. When I call the owner and it went into voicemail, when I did talk to the owner she's going to argue with me about the reason the meet was dry is was because I had the sauce on the side.there's a difference between dry and over cook the meat was never on the Spit it was already cut and dry when cook all favor was gone. She cooking the food there no way she should have serve that. Went I was talking to her she wanted me to know I was not getting my money back. I was  calling her to let know about my order. She didn't try to make it right. Before I finish it was 6:30 p. m. So the meat was probably cut so they can clean up. Bad customer service."}
{"text":"Worse place to get a gyro, i don't recommend this place at all i just wasted $10 on the smallest gyro I've seen in my life no type of flavor chicken was disgusting it ONLY came with chicken sauce and tomatoes . Baladie Cafe is 100 times better great quality and the food is delicious"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! There is finally a great gyro place by my house and I no longer have to drive 30 minutes for a good sandwich. Yes it is to go only and yes it can take some time to get your food, but it is always fresh and always hot and ready. I cannot recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"The guy up front taking my order was really nice and they had my food ready right away, Chinese food quick! Food was great and I'll be back again. Side note: guy up front was really nice and friendly."}
{"text":"You guys are GREAT! I just went there for the first time. I met the owner & she was great. In fact, she let me taste the Greek salad that she made for me just to make sure that I would like it before I left. I loved it! My wife had a gyro & she said it was VERY good. You might think I'm crazy, but they have the best baklava in The United States!"}
{"text":"My friend was getting work done on her car nearby so we decided to stop by and check it out. I love Greek salads. I ordered the Greek salad with gyro meat. 

The salad was delicious! I felt like my salad had more gyro meat than what I typically get at other places 

One downside is that the cook is also the cashier so she is going back and fourth from the front to the kitchen. I was with my friend, who was also going to order food, but she started on my order and then 10 min later took my friends order, instead of ordering together. 

I get that they are \"new\" and probably still figuring things out. Hopefully eventually they can obtain more staff as they appear to be busy."}
{"text":"Best gyro in Vegas!!!!! Amazing amazing food. I will continue to order food from here. Excellent customer service. Keep up the great work !!!"}
{"text":"The best gyros we have had in the states! We fell in love with gyros when we lived in Germany and have not found gyros that were just as tasty until now. We live in the Northwest and not many options.  The baklava was very yummy too!"}
{"text":"What a jewel.   I absolutely loved it.  I got a large Greek salad and tried the gyros.   Tasted great.  The service was personal and fast.  This is now my favorite place to get a salad.  It was gigantic."}
{"text":"Overpriced and poor gyros
We are from Chicago and was told this was the best, we disagree was very disappointed 
Greek restaurant Galleria mall blows this place away"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place to EVERYONE!!! I got there right before closing on Friday the 13th, so you know I was already expecting something to be messed up but instead To my surprise I was greeted by A handsome Guy with a Welcome Back! I liked the fact that I wasn't rushed and he offered to answer any questions that I may have had.  I must say that I have visited this place before and there must be some new management or something going on as the SERVICE that I received was ABOVE and BEYOND what I expected and have received before. It's been a while since I've visited but If people like this guy are working I'll be back more often!  THE FOOD; the food was AMAZING!! this was the best gyro that I've had in a while you can tell they took the time to make it with pride and passion for food that they prepare.  And to top it off it was right under $10 and so worth it!!   So I'll be coming back which works for me since I live right around the corner :)"}
{"text":"I just discovered this little restaurant the other day from my family. I have to say, these are the best gyros I've ever had. The meat is tender and melts in your mouth. The hummus is to die for. There is a bit of a wait time only because the owner is by herself - but I promise you that this food is SO worth it!"}
{"text":"I so wanted this to be awesome! We desperately need something good in this area. Upon entry to the restaurant we were \"greeted\" by woman who was standing at the register but bolted back into the kitchen where there's a big window and a staff cook, all while shouting there were menus on the counter. She then yelled through the kitchen window (about 8ft away) \"Can I help you?\" I began to have to boldly speak my order to her as she was back in the kitchen (about 8ft away.) She then told me hold on a minute that she needed to procure a pen. Once she was prepared, I placed our order. The food was mediocre at best. The salad was odd, fancy bagged fescue with a light smattering of the usual Greek salad suspects and way too much dressing. The gyros that supposedly had \"the works.\" I'd hate to see their version that isn't \"the works.\" The chicken was funky and not in a good way. The tzatziki was good. As a new business you'd think someone would take the time to properly greet patrons and maybe give a brief overview of the place. Running off to the back and shouting from the kitchen gives off the impression that customers are some BS hassle. That may fly in NYC. It's actually considered charming in NYC, not so charming in some forgotten little shopping plaza where no food business has succeeded since its inception. That location has been several pizza places and a taco shop. All failed. Maybe it's just a tax write off for someone and they could give two tzatzkis about hungry customers with cash. Maybe it sits on some dark vortex. Either way, I won't return or recommend."}
{"text":"Very tasty gyro! Ask Mona for the fresh potato wedges with feta! Though I did not get a dessert, they looked delicious. Next I want to try the steak sandwich. Good food and nice, friendly customer service!"}
{"text":"Give this place a try, the food is good! We ordered a gyro plate, hummus w/pita, and a gyro (Aphrodite) and a side of potatoes. Everything was well above average, fresh, and perfectly seasoned. I highly recommend the Little Greek :)"}
{"text":"Had some salad and gyro for lunch, everything tasted very fresh and delicious. Location is not far from where I work, so definitely a place to go back. Oh and by the way the baklava was amazing!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delish!! Gyro was amazing, will eat here again! The service was fast and very friendly. I would definitely recommend getting the potatos with your food."}
{"text":"Arguably the Best Gyro and baklava in Las Vegas! Bless you and the wonderful food you make for us to enjoy."}
{"text":"Sencillamente la comida está espectacular! 
Es un lugar pequeño un poco escondido para las delicias que presenta ! Vale la pena venir 
Un sándwich con sus papás es suficiente para que una persona quede satisfecha"}
{"text":"This place is heaven sent! My first time trying a gyro and I don't think I'll ever be able to compare. The owner, Mona, is awesome and very kind. Mona gave me a sample to try before ordering and the meat is juicy, tender and has the perfect amount of flavor. The sauce compliments the meat as well.  I ordered the Ra gyro. You pay for great quality food! The energy in this place is radiating! And if you're into crystals and healing, there are also fine crystal jewelry, keychains, and more. (I had to get one!) Your food is made fresh and is also done fairly quickly.  I love love love this place and will probably be coming every week! Thanks Mona and see you soon!"}
{"text":"The best gyros in town! Small town family feel inside and they offer a military discount. My husband and I love this place! Definitely recommend the Zeus. I add olives and feta to mine, and the baklava is out of this world good! My mother got the Greek salad and loved it. The hummus is delicious also."}
{"text":"Ordered online from yelp went easy. food was ready on time and very good. Not a big selection but fast and simple with tasty food."}
{"text":"This is what Greek food should taste like - everything I had was great. The Gyro was well seasoned and grilled just right (I suggest getting it with feta) - the Taziki sauce had just the right amount of garlic and was super fresh - the Falafel was excellent and perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside - the potatoes taste like grandma used to make them in her kitchen. 

The customer service was also spot on. Couldn't be happier I found this place. Looking forward to eating this on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I love Greek food. My favorite dish is gyros sandwich. Always fresh, have a  lot of flavors. Good and quick service, so we come here quite often."}
{"text":"Yummm. Definite go to. Fresh, plentiful, and delicious. My mouth and tummy were happy!"}
{"text":"Didnt like this place.  Lady owner was berating employee in front of me and son.  No food is worth watching a person be humiliated.  She was yelling at her about her use of the cash register even before we got to that part of the transaction.

Pita was crumbly beef was dry like been on roaster too long..."}
{"text":"Great place. Owner was able honor their BOGO promotion.  Will definitely come back to get more of their  Greek cuisine. If you have not tried it. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed. Pass the word on. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and great food, I love this place. I have been coming here for awhile now and it new never let me down and I brought my kids to try something new and they loved this place. I will back again and soon."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp while waiting at the dmv. Was a hard spot to find being in an automotive area. The person helping us was most likely the owner. She gave my wife a nice size sample made fresh before we ordered. The gyros were great portions lots of meat and tasted very well. Some of the ends were a bit over cooked and tasted crispy but overall the food was great. The owner even brought us some hummus and pita on the house. We paid at the end of eating. This place is recommended if in the area."}
{"text":"I saw the ad for this place while waiting at the drive thru in the McDonald's behind them for a request from my daughter. I refuse to eat fast food but she's 10 so what the heck :) 

I absolutely love Mediterranean cuisine, Turkish, Greek, all of it! I got so excited at the idea of having some close to home that I decided to go in and try it out. 

The place is small and is only set up for take out, not dining in. Not a big deal in my book since I have no problem with taking food home and eating in my PJ's. There was only one person working the counter, I assume she was the owner. When I ordered the combo plate which comes with a Gyro and seasoned potatoes she informed me they were sold out of the potatoes. I then ordered just the \"Works\" Gyro and some stuffed grape leaves (my fave!!!). She informed me that they were sold out of those too... Bummer!

I settled on an order of 2 Works Gyros, an order of Hummus and a Greek Salad with Organic Chicken. 

She then proceeded to make my order as I waited, the smell was amazing. When she was done she brought everything to the front and told me that she was giving me a Tabouleh salad on the house, which I thought was super classy! It made up for the potatoes and grape leaves. She was very gracious and friendly and I appreciated the gesture.

When I got home and my hubby and I took a bite of our Gyros, hummus and Tabbouleh we were in heaven! Everything tasted so fresh, so delicious, like it was made with love.

I am now a forever fan of My Little Greek and will visit it often. I wish the lovely owner the best of luck and hope that more people in our community give this gem a try. I promise you won't regret it!

P.S. My only constructive criticism would be that it is too quiet, perhaps some music in the background would liven things up while people wait for the delicious food they're about to get."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!!! Authentic,  appetizing,  friendly,  etc. My mom & I ate here for the first time this evening & we were very happy with everything.  Thank you for being so nice & putting love in our food. We will be regulars. ..."}
{"text":"This place is so bomb breh me and my girl fux with this place heavy. The owner does everything so that probably plays on her \"attitude\" have some understanding.
Go in and get that yung Zeus its fire 
Keep making them gyros!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Greek restaurant in Vegas. My family has tried a number of Greek restaurants around town and we are most impressed with this one. Meat was delicious. The salad was fresh and light. My daughter loved her Zeus."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have tried many Gyros in Las Vegas and they aren't very good. Here though I truly love their gyros, their pita bread is so fresh that it tends to fall apart so you have to hold onto it, they get the sauce just right and I love it! Don't even get me started on their meat, it melts like butter in your mouth while your eating it and is full of flavor! I go here all the time and I honestly can't get enough of it!"}
{"text":"I'm really bummed this place didn't work out because we are in need of good Greek food on this side of town. The Little Greek had a yelp deal that I purchased for $15 and it ended up getting fully refunded. Hubby and I stopped by for lunch and after walking inside we quickly noticed that there were no chairs or tables. There was a guy working (said his name was Nick) and he greeted us from the back and said they take to-go orders only. Well, OK we can eat in our car it's not like we haven't before, so hubby and I asked if they had any menus since there was no menu board, only posters promoting the frozen gyro meat they use. The guy said the owner, Mona doesn't wasn't to spend anymore than she has to, so she prints menus at home. I honestly don't mind at all that the owner prints the menus at home, plenty of other places have printed menus and to-go menus, I just wouldn't have minded if they also had some type of menu/pricing posted. 

Greek Salad ($6.50) - Menu said this has lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, feta cheese and homemade dressing. I had never seen a Greek Salad with no olives, so that was kind of odd. I ordered 2 of these salads. 

Gyros Works ($7.79) - Lamb/Beef, tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, onions and feta wrapped in a pita. There wasn't any chicken on the menu, lamb/beef was the only option. Boo. I ordered 2 of these and they had a buy one get one free special, cool! Hubby customized his a little since he doesn't like tzatziki sauce or tomatoes and the guy taking our order seemed happy to make it the way he wanted. 

I also picked out some goodies from the glass case. A couple different kinds of Baklava ($4.99 each), some assorted pastries and chocolate. After picking them out I asked what the difference was between all of the baklava in the case. He said the only difference is the supplier it comes from. He said the owner does sometimes make baklava, but most of what was in the case is stuff that comes pre-packaged and ready to be sold. Very disappointing that a local place wouldn't make their own baklava and pastries all of the time instead of getting from elsewhere. 

After paying AND leaving a generous cash tip in the jar, The guy yells from the back that they do not have enough gyro meat. Looking at the meat on the rotisserie there was only scraps left. He then tells me they have no lettuce or tomatoes for the salads. He said the owner was gone grocery shopping and would be back shortly and apologized for forgetting about the lack of veggies and meat. I asked him why he would even take out order and our money knowing that he was out of so much stuff?! He said he just simply forgot and then brought a single chair from the back to sit on while waiting. I guess hubby and I were supposed to take turns with the one chair? At this point a couple came in that placed a phone order for 2 salads and now they were told to wait because they had no lettuce or tomatoes and there I was sitting in a chair while hubby and the 2 customers stood waiting... awkward! During the time we waited the guy just kept saying \"hang in there I'm so sorry the owner will be back I promise\" and after hearing this and waiting 40 minutes, I had enough. I asked for a refund and the guy asks me if there is anything he can do to avoid giving me a refund. I said no, I just wanted a refund because we had waited far longer than we should have and I was very unhappy about the experience. He ended up giving me a refund and asked if I'd come back to try them again and I responded that \"I will not be back, but I hope that you enjoy that cash tip I left in the jar after we placed our order\" and he responded \"yes, I will thanks\" and I just kind of shook my head and walked out. I walked out with no food, no goodies yet still managed to spend money with the tip I left. I waited until they had been open a couple of weeks before stopping by hoping any kinks they had would be worked out. Obviously they have more than a few kinks to work out and communication is really key. Employees need to know what's available before taking orders and money. I heard this guy on the phone with the owner, so she was aware customers were waiting and what they were out of.

UPDATE: The owner Mona responded to my review and when you see it for yourself you will see how she lacks customer service and doesn't care about improving her business. She says Nick hasn't worked for her in months with no apologies about my experience. She mentions the menu being from Dec 2015 like that makes any difference? I always date my pictures to show when I had the experience. Anyone who sees my review will see I purchased a yelp deal so yes it was real. Yelp matters and not everyone has the same opinion, she shouldn't mention other reviewers liking the food it's tacky and shows she doesn't care about my experience meaning she certainly doesn't care much at all. If you like this type of food you should visit Shawarma House at Craig and Jones it's the best you will find in the area."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in Las Vegas .  The food is very authentic and cooked to order.  The staff and the owner are always very polite and welcoming. Its tucked away and easy to miss but once you find it you will be glad and will become a regular like me and my friends."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in North Las Vegas! Hidden Gem. Very surprised how not very many people know about them. Family owned and very delicious!!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent! The best gyro I've had in a long time! The potatoes are to die for along with the baklava! The service is exemplary, the host was very friendly and after she took my order stated \" I'm gonna make some magic\" and boy did she! Very happy with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying The Little Greek and the experience was a less than thrilling. I'm giving 3 stars (generously) because the food did taste good for the most part but service and handling of issues was a big turn off. 
My roomate and I placed separate orders through the Yelp app. I ordered the small Greek salad and gyro combo and chose the \"pay with cash\" option. He placed his order and chose to pay with card, so the transaction had already gone through by the time we arrived. The app said that the wait time would be 10-35 minutes, so I called the restaurant before to get a better estimate/make sure they had received the orders. I called 3 TIMES with no answer, so we decided to head that way to be safe. 
When we arrived, there was a paper sign on the door that read \"closed for democratic event\", but walked up anyway because we had already paid for a portion of our order. After some struggle, it was found that only one order was received (mine) and the card transaction was \"not received\" but payment had already been taken out...strange. The \"owner\" (when I asked if she owned the place, her response was \"it depends on the day of the week\") quickly prepared the other order and sent us on our way without an apology or any encouraging reason to come back and visit. I understand that the restaurant was preparing for an event, but also feel that customer service ALWAYS comes first and that the staff could have handled things better. 
In the end, I did enjoy my gyro, despite the fact that it was fullllll of tomatoes, which I requested to be left out. Same thing with the Greek salad. Full of tomatoes and wayyyyy too much of the Greek dressing. I may come by again, but will explore other options first."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  I was expecting a dining area but I was told they weren't allowed to have tables because there was no public restroom in front.  The Greek potatoes were fresh and delicious. The gyro tasted amazing and the tzatziki sauce was definitely homemade.   I will be back and I can't wait for them to add seating!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and authentic but a little pricey. Had 2 Zeus gyros came out to about $25"}
{"text":"I cannot believe this place has received high reviews. First they have a sign outside for Bakery there is NO bakery. Second the person who took care of us had absolutely no personality, no conversation, not even a Thank you. I am Greek, and have eaten Gyros at many different places so we were excited when we read reviews for The Little Greek. The meat was over cooked, and we have never had a Gyro that was not served with tomatoes and onions. Here you have to pay extra if you want tomatoes and onions. Cost for two gyros dry and over cooked meat side of fries and 1 soda over 25.00 dollars. I would have no problem with the cost if the food and establishment was worth my time and money. Honestly it was so bad it is not a place I would even give a second chance."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service!! Highly recommend to any gyro lovers or Greek food enthusiast."}
{"text":"Well, not too happy. Salmon is what I wanted it is on 2 items, but they are out. Seriously? Go across the street and buy some for heavens sake. Then she is rushing us to order. SMH 
Strip mall location, good parking.
I had a chicken bowl, it was ok. I get sad when I try something new and the staff seems annoyed to be bothered."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best Greek food I've ever had. Wonderful service, exceptional food, just overall amazing quality experience."}
{"text":"I went to your store and I just want you to know you know what your doing your flavoring is off the charts I could live on your food every day of my life and you my dear are so kind please keep up the good work I am telling all my friends!!! Thank you for letting me taste your wonderful food!!!!"}
{"text":"The gyro must have been made yesterday because I came at noon today and there was no meat on the spit.  What I got was barely edible...like it was paper thin and fried.   I had to throw a lot of it out.  The hummus was good but a bit pasty.  The salad was wet.  Overall, I was sad because if it was good, I would  be a weekly customer.  By the way...the tab for above was over $21."}
{"text":"Best gyro of our lives to date. We will absolutely be back time and time again.

We consume a fair amount gyros, it's recently become our favorite fair food and it's a typical Saturday afternoon snack. We had this place bookmarked for a while and were in the area so we popped over. The location is a little bit confusing to find, and the sign (although large) is hard to see from the entry point of the plaza. There is plenty of parking so it's easy to walk right in. We were the only customers inside.

There were five tables with seating for two. The counter is half service counter and half glass case filled with items for purchase from Greece. The glass case's size was confusing, but we later found out that it is being removed at the new year and being replaced with a Mediterranean salad bar of sorts.

We were served by the owner, a no nonsense woman who is clearly passionate about her food. I asked for the Apollo with gyro meat and she told me \"no-it was a vegetarian sandwich you can't put meat on it.\" We then got the Athena but added cucumbers - it should have come with a side of potatoes. We waited for close to 30 minutes for the food and during that time an Uber order was picked up (they arrived just after us and left just before us) and a family of five. The family of five ended up leaving after waiting 15 minutes and finding out it would be another 25 minutes wait for the chicken pasta they wanted. 

The. Food. Oh my goodness. What this place lacks in customer service, it more than makes up for in WHOA FACTOR. Our gyros were massive, overflowing and beautiful. Fresh ingredients piled high on a pillowy soft pita, topped with a healthy amount of feta..and then there's the meat. I'm still thinking of the meat today. It was tender, with crispy edges, flavorful, juicy and abundant! So much food. Every bite was heaven. My husband doesn't get emotional about food - but he was reeling over this gyro. He told me we would definitely be back, because he needed more of this is in his life. The gyro was hard to finish for both of us, but we made it happen regardless. This was one of those times where you can't eat a bite more, but you want to keep tasting it so you find a way. 

We didn't get the side of potatoes (thankfully) and will be checking out the baklava on the next trip. Our two meals +2 drinks cost less than $20. 

The owner asked us to tell our friends about this place because as it was, the place isn't going to stay in business - which makes me incredibly sad. 

Please go, try it out, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in the valley, quality meat and fresh veggies. Tried the gyros and they were amazing!!!! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"One of the best Greek places that I have ever eaten at. Gyros were gigantic and the pork kabobs serving were so generous. Meat was tender, pita bread was huge and soft, and that Tzatziki sauce was to die for. I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I'm always on the search for my \"gyro place\"... I've found it! My wife and I just finished eating a late lunch here and it was fantastic! Gyro was not dried out and all the veggies and feta were very fresh. The best part was the tatziki sauce. It was freshly made and the real deal! It wasn't sour cream or some plain yogurt mixed up, it was full of flavor! The baklava looked great too but between our gyros and the potatoes (which are perfectly cooked and seasoned) we were stuffed! Great gyros! We will definitely be returning since this is definitely now my gyro place."}
{"text":"Read the online reviews about how the food was good quality. The food was good (giving it 2-stars), the service was not. Walked in with a group of people. The owner took a few people's order, then walked away and left the rest of the group standing at the counter to cook the first two people's meals. The rest of us had to sit down and wait for the owner to finish the first meals. She never took anyone else's order and brought out two people's orders and just waited until another employee arrived at the restaurant to have them take the remaining orders. She told us she was too busy to take the remaining people's order. During the meal the owner gave out loyalty cards to the first two people in the group, then when we asked for another one after we finished eating, she acted like they didn't have any cards. Her employee had to come out to the front and give us a card. Not going to use it, other places have significantly better service than this place and actually want customers. Great staff though, what you hope for at a small, independent Ma/Pa eatery."}
{"text":"I don't usually give bad reviews, but this place was ridiculous.  They advertise themselves as a deli and BAKERY.  I thought a piece of baklava sounds good, so I stopped in.  Sorry, no baklava.  Sorry, no other pastries either.  What bakery doesn't have baked goods?"}
{"text":"First time going to this place. The gyro meat is great and it was filling. My mom adores the young man that helped her out and we couldn't be more pleased with the service.  I can't wait to see what they grow into! I'll be back in the new year."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and I ordered the jumbo gyro special, which comes with extra meat, potatoes and a drink. Which they do not have a fountain machine nor do they offer tea. Therefore go to the AM/PM next door to get your drinks if your getting it to go. Anyway back to the visit, I found the two ladies very friendly, and the gyro sandwich was very good. Potatoes were simply something as a compliment they were not anything special other than boiled, chilled diced fried with some thyme. I'd suggest sticking with fries with the gyro.

 I'm not sure what type of business they are wanting to be however because when you walk in they have this counter where they sell jam, jewelry and other items too. It's a huge display and sticks out overwhelmingly.

Yet the gyro sandwich was very good. I'll be back I'm sure but I would like to see refillable beverage options and fries."}
{"text":"Service was over the top as was the food. Nothing better than going to eat and getting great service and good quality food!!! I got a large Greek salad with gyro and the pita with hummus and I couldn't put my fork down!! I recommend the little Greek."}
{"text":"Wow, outstanding Gyro sandwich combo and grape leaves! Although the excellent food is more than reason enough to highly recommend this restaraunt to anybody, the pleasant experience is amplified by the sparkling personality of the owner who exudes warmth, wit, and humor. A++ :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time. It's very small and quaint. The cashier was very friendly. I got the jumbo works gyro. The meat was excellent! I'd give the gyro meat 5 out of 5 stars. I ordered my gyro without lettuce but it was put on anyways. No biggie though; I just took it off. I don't like lettuce on any kind of sandwich. It was a spring mix which I thought was odd. Usually they have a little Romaine or iceburg. I enjoyed the red onions but if you don't like strong onion taste/smell you may want to order light onions. I wish the potatoes had more seasoning and had some brown on them. Honestly they weren't necessary though. The gyro was very good and VERY filling that I couldn't even finish it. I enjoyed the food overall and will be going back."}
{"text":"One evening we had a craving for Greek food and after searching Yelp, we decided to give this place a try. We stopped by and the restaurant was already closed because they sold out of food! We agreed to try the place again when they were open because if they were running out of good, it had to be top notch.

Our second attempt they were open. I was hoping for some falafel, but the owner advised me they no longer sell it since there wasn't a demand. She verified if I was looking for strictly vegetarian options (which I was not), before recommending the Zeus. I ordered the Zeus (Gyro meat in pita bread with Tzatziki sauce, chopped tomatoes, onions) and ordered the Hades (Gyro Sandwich with Tzatziki sauce, chopped tomatoes, onions, extra Gyro meat, lettuce, feta cheese, with a side order of potatoes cut into wedges, a coke, and two cookies).

The portions are enormous! You really get what you pay for when getting food here. The owner takes a lot of pride in the food she prepares and it definitely shows. The Tzatziki sauce is prefect, the vegetables are fresh, and the meat is perfectly cooked. We have been back since and would highly recommend this spot to people looking for delicious Greek food. Don't be thrown off by the reviews describing the owner in a negative view point. She is friendly and helpful anytime I am in there with all of her customers."}
{"text":"I had seen this place several times while driving by and was excited to try it,  hoping it would be a good option for gyros so close to me. I read many of the reviews and decided to overlook the ones that talked about the poor service because most said the food was good. I ordered pick up through yelp (they use Eat 24) and received a confirmation email. When I arrived to pick up, there was a sign on the door stating 'closed for private party.' Odd, considering it's just a take out place, not really dine in. I motioned to one of the 3 gentlemen sitting at one of the 2 tables in the front. He opened the door and went to get the owner. I know it was her because of what ensued next and the reviews I read about her service. She told me she cancelled the order and that she was sold out of gyro meat until Monday. She actually argued with me when I told her I only received a confirmation email and no cancellation until I showed it to her on my phone. Anyhow, no dinner there for us. I totally understand mix ups and miscommunication, and would have overlooked this if she had behaved differently. I am writing this poor review because I feel that she could have done SOMETHING to prevent and/or make up for this issue, and she did not. I feel that she could have turned off the ability to order through yelp if the restaurant wasn't taking orders due to a party or lack of food. If this is not possible, she could have offered to compensate me on my next visit in some way for my inconvenience. At the very least, she could have been more apologetic and empathetic. Her only apology was a quick 'sorry about that' as I walked out- AFTER arguing with me and telling me they had no food. As a result, her poor service skills have caused her to lose a potential customer that, if I had enjoyed the food, would have frequented her establishment. The bottom line is, the responsibility falls on the restaurant to make unfortunate situations like this right, even if the fault involves other outside vendors or agencies, and she failed to do so. A sincere apology and an effort at compensation for one's trouble will go such a long way with most people and would have earned you much more than it would have cost you in repeat business."}
{"text":"Great service and very cheerful! Food was freshly made! Fast service definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I have given one star simply because the food was edible. 

Now let's start with the service. My daughter and I walked in on a Sunday afternoon. The only customers were two people who had already received there food and were eating and two people who were ordering when we walked in. We ordered our food...3 gyros, no drinks or sides, that's it! The girl that took our ordered seemed overwhelmed with work! Why? Because the owner, Mona, was in the backed complaining to the girl about everything she did. Completely verbally abusing this poor girl! After waiting 15 minutes....yes 15 minutes, the owner, Mona, asked if we had ordered already. Really? We had been waiting 15 minutes and she saw us when we walked in. 

I said \"yes, we've been waiting 15 minutes for 3 gyros\". Her response, in a sarcastic manner said \"sir, I'm the only cook here. This isn't McDonalds\". I just shook my head trying not to go off on this lady in front of my daughter. The two people who were eating even said \"bet you'll never come back\"! The gyro meat is already cooked, lettuce, onions, cucumbers, and sauce are already cut and made. It's not that f#%king hard to make a gyro! I've work in a fast paced environment and if this lady/owner can't handle 6 people in her restaurant then she should consider getting out of the restaurant business! Zero customer service skills and zero employee skills! 

That being said, I will NEVER, EVER, step foot in her establishment again....and to the poor girl that works for this tyrant, look for something better, you certainly can do better."}
{"text":"Hard Visibiltiy to see where the restaurant was located, but other then that... everything was great! I know Greek & Mediterranean food because I've been to market grill cafe and paymons hundreds of times. But Honestly, I can say they have the best tasting beef gyro! Order the Gyro Works! Chicken or Traditional you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!! I'm a repeat customer and enjoy their delicious gyros and Greek salad. I've tried their \"to die for\" potatoes and wrapped grape leaves too. I've always experienced friendly service. It's located at Simmons and Ann Road behind McDonald's. I'd much rather eat at Little Greek who has fresh ingredients and home made sauce than fast food any day. Keep in mind this place is take out. Please support our local ma/pa businesses. ;)"}
{"text":"We had The Little Greek restaurant deliver a meal for 11 to our home. It was a big hit! It was enough food for twice that many people and everything was delicious. We had the gyros and the chicken, plus the greek salad, potatoes, and hummus. It was very affordable too!"}
{"text":"Hreat place authentic greek food. Must try! I came here on my lunch the owner took good care of me. Seems like a pretty new spot. She aslo comes once in a while arounf the neighborhood giving companys free samples of her food."}
{"text":"The gyros here are the best I've ever had. The side of potatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly. I met the owner Mona and she was very polite and comforting to talk to. They also give a military discount, I will be coming back"}
{"text":"The Little Greek is a new little restaurant on my foodie radar.  It had a straight forward menu with salads, gyros, roasted chicken and dessert. More of a take out place with a small waiting area, but the conversation is worth the wait.  The owner and staff are very friendly and have great customer service.  I had the standard gyro (one of the best I have ever had) and loved the baklava!  Although I live clear across town, I will certainly may my way over there again.  If you are looking for something delicious, healthy and filling - The LG will satisfy your appetite!

Thank you Mona for putting love and care into your food -  It definitely shows."}
{"text":"TAKE OUT ONLY-
Stopped in for a quick lunch. Its kind of hidden next to Terrible's. Very pleasant and friendly staff (owner!) and the INCREDIBLE SMELLS!! We've missed things like this.
Three Gyros with the Works- oh man, this is the way it should be done! Shaved to order and included some (Home Made!!) baklava to go.

You must try this place and share with your friends. Can't wait to get back to LV and hit this again!

UPDATE: meat was tender and the pita very fresh. This is food for a carnivore. PLENTY of meat, enough protein to hold me over..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because you have to buy cans or bottles of drinks and I prefer all you can drink. Other than that, this place is awesome! I had the gyros combo. The meat was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The pita was soft and tasty and the sauce delicious. The side of potatoes was huge and very tasty. I would definitely come back here any time I want gyros. They just need a soft drink fountain. Lol."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a while now, but I never have time. Well, today I stopped in for the Baklava and it was absolutely delicious. The lady working told me she made it this morning and you could tell it was fresh. The layers were delicately flaky and the nuts and seasoning were sweet and fresh. I absolutely loved the honey layer at the bottom of my container. It was sinfully delicious! Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience.The restaurant was clean, the service was great and the food was even better! The hummus and pita bread is amazing! The portions are big and the price is right."}
{"text":"Today is our first time here and the guy who is the cashier/cook seem pretty chill. We asked for his recommendation and he didn't disappoint us. Me and my hubby got gyros combo and they are very delicious!!!  The gyro meat was fresh from the pan and well seasoned. The sauce white sauce was refreshing and the tomatoes and onion were freshly cut. It was a joy in my mouth when I ate it. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Hello folks! Here I am once again at Little Greek. Since my last visit the menu has expanded and it's awesome!
The personal care and attention from Mona ( owner ) is always nice. Her business is doing well but I would encourage you to add this Greek eatery on your list of places to check out. Once you've tasted the delicacies you will definitely be back to try something else. I purposely timed my drive from the Venetian Casino, and it was a mere 18 mins. If the gravitational pull on my taste buds is strong enough I can make it in 15. Oops! Gotta go! I'm in the mood for ice-cream."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today since it is close to home, gyros were great and everything is fresh. Very pleasant service, will try again!"}
{"text":"Good food; no clue about customer service. Tried this place several times since it opened and every time the service leaves a bad taste in my mouth. No need for me to elaborate, it's all in the real yelp reviews."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give this place a try because it's location is close to home. We both ordered gyro meals that came with seasoned potatoes and a drink. The gyro was good and that is why I gave 3 stars however the potatoes were awful mush with no flavor. Truly did not beling on same plate with that gyro. Maybe a salad or even a handful of lays potato chips would have been better. We waited a while to be served and as soon as I saw my plate I was disappointed. The potaoes ruined the meal that otherwise could have been quite enjoyable. Hope they improve this because the gyro was good!
Also on a side note while we waited for our food we could hear the conversation in the kitchen and the owner Mona was mean to the young girl who yook our order. If anything prevents me from visiting again it is because of the way she treated the cashier."}
{"text":"I love this place and it has great tasting comfort food. I must say I am a little addicted to the gyros."}
{"text":"Highly recommended, super friendly service. The food and ingredients are fresh and wholesome. I support this place 100%"}
{"text":"Ordered the jumbo gyros works with the gyro meat (mainly beef and mixed with chicken).
Came with a can soda and potatoes.
Enjoyed it and will definetly be back.
Friendly people also."}
{"text":"We enjoy the gyros and the grape leaves very much. The proprietor is very pleasant as well. Give them a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is delicious however they say they deliver but every time I order I get a message back that says they are short drivers.  Just say you don't deliver for goodness sake"}
{"text":"Well first of all I am very disappointed with the customer service I received from the lady ( I'm guessing the owner ) I called last week too ask if they had delivery because Yelp says they DO deliver and she had an attitude when I was on the phone and said no they don't have delivery they're brand new and will have it in the future so passing by about a week after this I decide to go in and get a Gyro and \" Greek Salad \" mind you I've had many different Greek places out here in Las Vegas well she had an attitude from the beginning when I first walked in and I brushed it off and I was awkwardly looking around for a menu and then finally she decided too come around to the front from behind the counter and point out a paper menu and ask what do I want . Well I ordered as I always get anytime I have Greek EXTRA Tzatiki sauce and extra dressing on my salad I can't complain she did give me extra BUT there wasn't much on it too begin with , and the Gyro was very tiny for the price and only had 3 small stripes of meat in it ( I laugh because going in I asked for a beef Gyro and she said in a smart alike way they're beef but not 100% beef and acted like I didn't know what I was talking about, I used to get Greek food atleast 4 times a week back when I was in college and I know what it is lol ) anyways The \" Greek Salad was hardly a Greek salad at all way too Much lettuce and barely any tomatoes and onions and two olives I couldn't even finish it :( so no I'm still hungry and out of $16 will not be going back there's plenty of good places too go too around here don't settle for this one . Also no feta cheese on the salad not sure if they were out or they only put it on certain customers salads ..."}
{"text":"Little Greek is great spot for lunch or dinner. Excellent Gyros.The greek salad is one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Hands down the best greek food around North Las Vegas. The gyro I had was amazing. The service was excellent and fast. Additionally the place is very clean.  A must try!"}
{"text":"Gyros are magical because they have the capability to mask the potency of onions. Even an onion hater like me can suddenly consume onions once they're inside a gyro. Unfortunately, the onions inside the gyros at The Little Greek were not the magical kind. They were regular diced onions that smacked me in the face with their spiciness and bitterness. 

My husband and I each ordered a gyro combo ($8.99), which comes with a gyro with the works, a bag of chips, and a pastry. I got my gyro sans meat, and told the employee to give me extra everything else. I've done this at other gyro places and have never really been disappointed. Here, the gyro was sparse and was about 80% lettuce. There were few tomatoes and I felt there was barely any tzatziki sauce or feta cheese. Even worse, once I took the first bite of my gyro the pita wrap completely crumbled. It's not everyday that I eat a gyro with a fork.  

My husband said his meaty gyro was alright. I don't see us returning until a suitable vegetarian option is put on the menu (like falafel) or they at least get fries. If there is a next time, I'll remember to hold the onions.

{"text":"I just started eating Greek good 6 months ago.  I started going to different Greek restaurants to compare and nobody has better tasting gyros  ! my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out as we're going to be moving nearby, and had the Hades and the chicken bowl. The meat was exceptionally delicious and super crispy. Her tzatziki sauce is fresh made daily and was the best I've ever had! I'm so full rusty I can't try my baklava yet. If you like authentic Greek gyros, you've got to come check this place out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food here at the Little Greek! I have never had a bad meal! Where as it isn't really a sit down eatery, the owner has added a couple of tables and chairs which is nice when I prefer to \"eat in!\" Give it a try!"}
{"text":"i wish i could give them 0 starts but unfortunately i cant so i guess they will get 1 star ... this place is nasty and gyro was so dry  ... waist  of money... the lady was rude and gross..."}
{"text":"Such a great find! My coworkers had the Greek salad with chicken and I grubbed on their Combo. Would definitely recommend this place and would come back. The baklava was outstanding!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place one star is because the food is good. However the service is TERRIBLE. On my first visit I called in an order (the jumbo) which came with a drink. I sent someone to pick my order up and they did not give them my drink. When I called about this, I was blamed. I allowed them the benefit of the doubt on that one. I called back three days later to place an order, because it was only my second time I had one question about the combo. I was asked to call back to place my order because she was \"busy with a customer\", I simply asked, if I'm calling to place an order, am I not a customer??? I told her I no longer wanted to place my order. NEEDLESS to say I will NEVER spend my money with this unprofessional restaurant that lacks basic customer service skills again. Absolutely the worst!"}
{"text":"Great food! The stuffed grape leaves are to die for.. All of the food is great, fresh and home made.."}
{"text":"After a serious craving for gyros, my boyfriend and I did some research here on Yelp for where to go and found The Little Greek. We walked in around 2:30pm today (Wednesday) and were instantly greeted by a nice lady behind the counter. The shop is small...4 tables with chairs (2x 2 person tables & 2x 4 person tables), with a large display case and a counter with a window looking into the kitchen behind it. 

The menu is very limited, but based on reading past reviews it has grown. They have a few different gyro sandwich/platter options, a chicken sandwich, falafel sandwich, veggie sandwich, tabouleh, hummus, and a few other things which I skimmed over. Some of the platters and combos come with potatoes and/or a drink (no fountain drinks. Just bottled or can sodas and water). I ordered a gyro sandwich that came with a side of potatoes (not fries!) and my boyfriend got the \"Jumbo gyro\" which was an open faced gyro sandwich with lettuce and feta cheese, served with a side of potatoes and a drink. The gyro meat was delicious!! I really enjoyed it. It was a little well done, with a crispy exterior and a softer (but well done) interior. But the real winner were the potatoes. They were roasted potatoes, cut up and perfectly seasoned. So delicious!!

As I mentioned, this place is tiny. They have a few photos of Greece up on the walls and a large chalkboard menu. They have more menus printed on the counter with more options listed. The display case doesn't have anything other than pictures and nik-naks. I get the feeling that they restaurant is still newish, but I imagine once business starts to pick up more, they'll fill the display case with more food options. 

There was only one woman working there when we went in, but she was very friendly and we chatted for a bit. Overall, I definitely think we'll be back...and often!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Gyro meat well prepared. Very friendly service. Come here, every weekend. Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident not long after it opened.  I was looking for Sweet Delights Bakery and it had a sign at this location but was closed.  I kept coming back as I had heard good things about it on yelp and was hoping it would open.  One day the sign was changed and Little Greek had opened.  I had been looking for a good Greek restaurant near me but all were a long drive and the ones I had tried were a bit disappointing.  So figured I would try this new place and I keep coming back.  The menu has changed a bit over time but I have enjoyed experimenting.  However the gyro and souvlaki are my favorites and Mona has always been friendly and helpful.  Recently had the baklava and it was the best I have had as most are too sweet and sticky for my taste."}
{"text":"Food is superb and great. But the service, owner and lack of ownership of order mistakes will keep customers away. 

Ordered a large greek salad with \"gyro\" meat for delivery along with other food items. 

Everything was correct except for the salad which had no \"gyro\" meat. 

I called restaurant to explain the missing item and was told by the owner that they would call GrubHub to ask to have the item re-delivered. I then called GrubHub and was told the owner said to just refund the salad and not re-deliver the missing \"gyro\" meat. I have no interest in a refund, I want the meal that I ordered to be corrected. I'd like to have my lunch because I'm just a bit hungry after waiting an hour for the delivery...

So now I have the rest of my family enjoying their meal (as best they can), while I sit here stewing about a restaurant owner that has no interest in making things right. 

Then, to top things off GrubHub contacted the owner again to try to make things right and the owner told them that she has already six other GrubHub orders being worked on and doesn't have the time for this so to just refund the charge for the salad.

So at the end of the day, the owner lost money, GrubHub didn't get paid and I have no lunch. Lose... lose... lose... for everyone. As business owners ourselves we try to make it win-win for everyone not lose-lose. 

Not to mention my wife and I order from this restaurant very often, but not anymore... A sad ending for everyone.

I guess I'll be ordering Chinese."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of dirty gyros. You know the kind that are super stuffed with meat and dripping sauce? This place has the best dirty gyro I've ever had. The meat is seasoned so well, the tzatziki sauce is cooled, creamy and delicious. Their feta isn't that bullshit crumble lie that other places serve you. They chopped their shit in slivers and pile it on. The gyro meat is cooked so well and has little crunchy bits. Ugh its just so good. You know the food is good when you have to write the review while you're still in the restaurant. The food is that amazing."}
{"text":"Not open any longer, place was all closed up went looking forward to Greek food. Please take off Yelp."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp, close to house, great reviews. Wow, GREAT food!!! Had a Gyro and potatoes.... Wife and I loved it....great flavor. 
Don't forget to ask for military discount"}
{"text":"Great customer service. The gyro was delicious I ordered the Zeus it was first time trying it, I give it a 5 star I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"My first mistake was walking in the door and patiently waiting for the owner aka the cook aka the waitress aka the cashier, to take my order. Miss Mona was wearing entirely too many hats for lunchtime...even though there was only 2 other customers in the shop with me. Needless to say, I waited, paid my ~$9.50 for the Gyro Combo, requested a bag and carried my food home. My food was a burnt, greasy mess!  The pita bread was falling apart, potatoes were under cooked and greasy and the meat was burnt. This is not the way to start off a new business.  I went back the next day to show Mona the pictures of the food she gave me and she never apologized, she must have thought I wanted my money back but I seriously thought bringing it to her attention would help her from doing this to someone else.  She got mad and told me to post it on Yelp.com.  Your wish is my command, Miss Mona!! Good luck Miss Mona, you've lost a customer and I made sure to tell all of the ladies in the gym, neighbors and family to skip this little Greek disaster!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is awesome. Just found out about them when I was getting new tires and boy am I glad I stopped in. Was greeted by a nice gentleman who talked with me like we were friends. Same with the owner! She started talking to me and instantly I felt like family. She is very sweet and really cares about the food and this restaurant.
The food- again wow! The food was hot and fresh. Honestly one of the best gyro I've had. I would have taken a picture but I ate it too fast lol I recommend this place for anyone who loves a good gyro."}
{"text":"We are locals and decided to try this place after reading the reviews and getting there coupons in the mail every week. And HONESTLY 

IM DISAPPOINTED the food was favorless. I ordered the gyro combo plate with rice  and it was so bland the meat was dry. I'm a really big foodie. And feel let down. 

We also had to wait such a long time for our food. 

I'd pass if I were hungry again and this was the only thing open to eat."}
{"text":"It's a small, family run shop with food that really can't be had in a 15-20 radius in any direction.  I went to try it, And I was behind two people in line. They ordered a good amount of food so it took a while to receive mine. I didn't mind though i'm not in a hurry. If you love a delicious kabab/gyro it's a great place to satisfy that craving. 

It's very tasty food. If you like greek food, go give it a try. It's better quality than mad greek or any other place i've had in town. Other people are correct. They take pride in what they put out and use good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelp recommendation. It's basically a little hole in the wall establishment. Pretty stark ambiance. Paper plates. Nor a huge variety of beverages BUT the food was hot and delicious. Large portions all well seasoned. I'm not a fan of gyro meat because I don't like lamb. The owner gave me a sample of her gyro meat and it was really good.  I don't live in the area, but I would definitely come here when I am in the area. The service was really good. Very personable."}
