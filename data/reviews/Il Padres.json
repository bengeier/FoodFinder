{"text":"I've been going to Il Padre's for a couple of years now, ever since I moved into the area - and I'm a huge fan of their pizza. 

It might be because I'm so tired of the mediocre pizza you get from all the chains, that I was really able to enjoy the genuine attention and friendliness that the owner and his wife put into their pizzas. 

The toppings are great, and they're always flexible when it comes to additions or substitutions. One time I was picking up a pizza with my girlfriend, and there was another couple in front of us who hadn't ordered yet. The man produced a can of corn from his pocket and asked whether or not the owner would mind adding it to their pizza. All weirdness related to carrying around a can of corn aside, the owner was happy to do it. 

You should expect a longer than usual wait on Friday or Saturday nights, just because of the sheer volume, but the service is usually quite good. 

The only complaint that I could possibly assess is that on some occasions, I've found the pizza to be a little salty - but other than that, as far as me and my family are concerned, Il Padre's is pretty much \"Always Your Best Choice\""}
{"text":"No rude disrespectful people deserve business. the pizza wasn't even good. been there multiple times and my last time was definitely my LAST."}
{"text":"For the price point, there is simply no better pizza in this neck of the woods.  Trust me, I've tried them all!  High quality toppings, decent dough with a nice crust, thoughtfully built pizzas. Salads are good, too, but I can't recommend the chicken wings (too small).  After over ten years of living near Royal York and Queensway, I've tried all the pizza joints around (Dino's, FBI, Il Paesano's, Thyme 4, Milano's, Pizza Nova, Mamma Martino's, Napolitan Pizza, etc., etc.).  I'd say it speaks volumes that Il Padre's has become my go-to!  Not to say that every pizza is a hit (I recommend the Artichoke, I do not recommend the Pesto), but I guarantee that you'll figure out what you like and what this quality joint is all about soon enough! Thanks, Il Padre's!  P.S. Ordering is through JustEat, and it tends to take a while - give it an hour before you'll see your pie..."}
{"text":"Bad experience. Twice. Not acceptable for a family owned business to be rude and confront people on their race or religion. The pizza was decent, but too flat, and too greasy. Too expensive for what you're getting. And on top of that, just an uncomfortable situation with only one or two staff actually being nice. The older staff, who are the parents probably, were just outright rude but pretended it never happened and they did nothing wrong. Only started getting mad and defensive when I had video proof of the racism and disrespect to 3 young girls."}
{"text":"Best tasting delivery pizza I've had in Toronto!  It's my go-to place.  Seriously.

I love all their veggie pizzas.  Topped with fresh toppings.  When you order roasted red peppers on your pizza, you get big chunks of actually roasted red peppers! AND they dont skimp out, unlike most places.  If you live in the area, order from this place.  

I moved to Etobicoke a year ago and tried Calibreze Pizza, Wize Guyz, Milano's Pizza, Il Paesano, Mamma Martinos, and Dino's pizza...and Il Padre beats them out.  

Fair warning, if you walk into this place, its a disaster.  Total mess.  Hole in the wall.  You wouldn't believe the amazing pizza this place puts out!

Another warning, do not order wings, unless you really really want wings and dont mind eating tiny wings.  Stick to the pizza.

They do take a while to deliver.  Almost always 40+ minutes.  But its worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best pizza! Family owned! And you can actually taste the difference. My fav little pizza place."}
{"text":"Best in Toronto!!!! Wow!!

{"text":"This place has all but turned me off of chain pizza places.
While I agree any pizza is a good pizza, this place has great pizza and it really shows you what pizza should be.
The owners are also about the most genuine and friendly people I've met."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop pizza shop located in Mimico neighborhood.  A favourite of students at nearby schools and has recently become one of my favorites.   
I had the pleasure of tasting their meat lovers large pizza while at friends place.  Oh man how I forgot how a fresh handmade pizza actually tastes like.  It tastes like heaven.

When you want a slice they make it fresh for you.   None of the mass produced slices you get atvthe franchise places.  If you're nearby they also deliver.  I just happen to have a friend that lives around the corner.

Anyways enough of my rambling go ahead and try them out for yourself.  I'm confident you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I just ordered the $29.99 2 medium pizza special from il Padre's. I was so disappointed. It took an hour and a half to get it. We are 5 minutes away. The pizza was cold and hard as a rock. The wings were small and colder then the pizza. I will never be ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Well I can't really agree with their slogan of \"Always Your Best Choice\".  The pizza was ok, nothing fantastic.  It was a big pizza for the price.  If you're in the area this is your only choice unless you can get delivery.  The toppings were good, though they were a little skimpy on the sauce."}
{"text":"Me and the lady had a misunderstanding over the phone, but she quickly answered my concerns and I let it slide. This is a family runned restaurant and the food really makes it seem so.. although I prefer a more goey chewy fluffy Pizza with lots of toppings.. this was thin crust but it was pretty decent. The bruschetta was good and they gave me a sweet caramel peanut buttery tasting sauce for free and said they make it in house, I liked it akot. The wings were tiny, which I personally love, but I didn't like them. I also got a Greek salad and it was Fresh and Delicious. I recommend if you are a thin crust lover, now because they don't make deep dish Pizza,  I wouldn't recommend for myself, I'd have to go somewhere else but if I'm in the mood for thin crust, I'd definitely think about a place like this. They have  no dessert which is a big deal for me because I like to eat and have dessert after and they don't have that here so keep that in mind, my sweet lovers."}
{"text":"Always a welcome from the owners every time we come in here. The pizza is good, and freshly prepared. It tends to be more cheese heavy than sauce heavy, but that isn't too bad in my opinion. A bit more sauce though and I would give five stars.

They really look after my kids each time we come in here, even letting them help in making their own slice one time."}
