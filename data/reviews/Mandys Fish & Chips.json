{"text":"I always find myself visiting Mandy's when I go to Phoenix. I was in Phoenix for four days and went three times. The third I went at 10:00am and waited until 10:15 and hey never opened. According to the information online they were supposed to open at 10:00 on Saturday. The first time I went during my trip I order the catfish and chips. The second time I went I ordered the special ( three pieces of catfish, three shrimp, three hush puppies, and fries.) Everything was good and the catfish was perfect. Many places I've been, the catfish is too greasy when fried, but Many's was excellent. I wish we had one of those in Northern California. 

The service was exceptional, I don't remember the young ladies name, but she was nice and pleasant"}
{"text":"The girl at the front counter was rude and had an attitude. I got the cod. It was very dry, I had to specifically ask for tarter sauce (which turned out to be a very small amount). Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I ordered today's special.. 3pc catfish, shrimp, hush puppies and fries. There were a few people ahead of me that took a long time to order so the cashier was kind enough to offer me a drink for my patience. The service is very pleasant and much better with the new cashier  than the service I've experience in the past. The food was good. Next time I would ask for a little more seasoning on the fish, other than that I would have given 5 stars"}
{"text":"Ok, being from the south, I know what a catfish dinner is supposed to taste like. My wife and I both had the catfish special. It consisted of 3 pieces of catfish, 3 shrimp, and 3 hush puppies.

I can safely say, it is the best catfish I have outside of the south.

Of course, I had to get a side of fried okra to go along with it and I had to share with my wife (oh well, one must do what one must do).

I not only will be back for more, I have no reservations about recommending this place to y'all. If you are looking for ambience don't bother coming, but if you want great food, then by all means come here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some fish. Went wash my hands Restrooms filthy no toilet paper, no paper towels."}
{"text":"I was not alone waiting to give people money for food. I waited in a line for about eight minutes before leaving. No one bothered to take my money,  I left hungry. 

The people at Mandy's had more important things to do like make small talk with pals who walked behind the counter, but all I got were blank stares. From people going in and out of the tiny kitchen we hungry customers we given a \"she'll be right out spiel\" several times and yet no \"she\" came to relieve us of money or to make food appear.

I dropped by on a whim,  but it's arguably the creepiest area of a nasty grocery strip center and the service,  or lack thereof, is a joke. Don't waste your money,  don't waste your time because this place is worth neither."}
{"text":"This place is great, I just found out about this location a few weeks ago, it's closer to home and work. Before that it was regular trips to their 24th and Jefferson location. 10xs better than Pete's. It's busy but they get to your order quick and your out the door."}
{"text":"Never again! The guy who took my order was on his phone the entire time, and after spending over $20 they charged me a quarter when I asked for tartar sauce. As bad as the customer service was, the food was worse. Fried oysters and shrimp were prefab; frozen I'm suspecting. And the fried fish (cod) had absolutely NO FLAVOR. Not seasoned at all. Sad that the best thing was the french fries. They'll never get another quarter from me."}
{"text":"This place gets 2 stars for just the feel of everyone in there treating the place like home.

It also gets two stars because it is way over priced for getting food that comes in frozen and isn't seasoned at all.  We tried the shrimp, catfish, hush puppies, fries, calamari rings, mozzarella sticks, and jalape√±o poppers. I'm not sure if the owner is getting their stuff from a vendor or just buying in bulk at the store, but the food is not worth what they charge. For the $40 I spent, I could've went to the store and bought everything fresh, make my own batter and fried it up WHILE making it taste good and flavorful without a drop of hot sauce. Even the tartar sauce was super bland and tasted like it came from a jar.  

Point of advice, even if you do have nothing made from scratch, you can always jazz it up a bit by adding flavor to it. 

It's sad when Long John Silvers is better...."}
{"text":"Not bad for a small restaurant. I had shrimp and chips which were very good and fresh. My fiance had catfish and chips and that was delicious
 It was our first time and it was not bad."}
{"text":"Mandy's Fish & Chips- If more people took the time to post a review- The Star Rating would be by average 2.5! The whiting is DRY, DRY, DRY. Also, the manager/cook will lie about things being \"fresh\". If I'm in this plaza with a buddy & they want to go.... i would join them. It's not the worst place imaginable, but i just don't see where these 5-star reviews come from!! Oh BTW the bathroom is atrocious! Its a small restaurant (one stall per sex). My advise would be to hire a cleaning company (use Angie's List for Pete sake) $37 p/w to straighten that crap (literally) up!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Good Catfish, Shrimp, Hushpuppies and Fries. Clean environment and affordable. #FoodJones"}
{"text":"These Fry's are so damn good the hot sauce and ketchup mixture omg yum and I don't even like ketchup unless it's for a corndog or hotdog  bread was thick chicken breast was crisp should've asked for Mayo on both sides of the bread but no complaints great $8 spent"}
{"text":"Just ate here today on a recommend.  Very good.  The catfish and shrimp were so clean, as was the facility.  My only complaints were:  the fries...they need to be crispier and the provided sauces need to be in bigger containers.  Very minor issues.  As a bonus, they sell Thrifty ice cream!"}
{"text":"Real fish.  Fried right.  Best fish and chips place on the Southside! Catfish, tilapia,  and shrimp are all good.  Must try!"}
