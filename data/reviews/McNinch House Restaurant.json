{"text":"Last night my wife and I enjoyed a nine-course tasting menu, and I had the best crab cake, salad, salmon, steak, and cheesecake I've ever eaten - all in one meal.  Our meal started with a crab-cake and a small crab salad (with dill, apple, and celery). The crab cake was so warm and fell apart beautifully, perfect spicing, a little n'orleans remoulade underneath, and the lump crab was so sweet and tender. The salad was rich and creamy, a few bites of decadence.  We then had an artichoke bisque, which was unfortunately the low point of the meal for both of us as neither of us loves artichoke much. The base of the soup was fantastic, but the tough bits of artichoke were just okay, and the cracked pepper garnishing the dish was very coarse ground (which provided contrast to the consistency of the soup, but seemed out of place).  Then on to a baby wedge salad, mine with blue cheese and buttermilk, Barb's with a housemade vinaigrette. The salad was composed with perfect bacon, dried bing cherries, spiced pecans, the blue was fragrant without being overwhelming. Barb's vinaigrette had so much body and cling, with such great balance that she couldn't stop making pleasant-eating-noises - you know the ones.  We had a little sorbet (blackberry, such concentration of fruit flavor), and then the three main courses.  The salmon was served with wilted spinach and a potato hash, but the salmon itself was cooked to a perfect and consistent temperature throughout without overcooking the edges, or a slightly-underdone-center. It had a gently spiced rock-hard crust on one side, with perfectly cooked salmon immediately below. The plate was served with a smooth and tangy lemon beurre blanc. Best salmon I've ever had.  Next was the duck course, our server Johnathan mentioned reminded him of Christmas. Beautiful rare duck breast, served on a bed of whipped sweet potatoes (perfectly smooth, none of that stringyness you sometimes get with sweet potatoes) that had been flavored with vanilla and brown sugar. Not overly sweet but absolutely decadent, and a small serving of sauteed brussel sprouts. The richness of the duck offset the cabbagyness of the sprouts, and the sweetness of the potatoes was a great offset to that pair. On top was a single sage leaf - the most fragrant I've ever smelled - which tied it all together and made it feel like christmas.  The third entree was the filet mignon, what Barb would have chosen, had we only had one choice of entree. Served rare to mid-rare, it had the same amazing cookery as the salmon, where the temperature and doneness was consistent throughout to almost within a millimeter of the soft crust. Served with a green peppercorn sauce, by far my favorite sauce of the night, which had spiciness and richness. The mashed potatoes served with the filet were nothing much on their own, but served as a perfect vehicle for the sauce, and the braised collards were noteworthy for both their balanced flavor as well as the fact that they were perfectly cooked. The greens had little snap in the backbone, they weren't wilted as so many collards become. They were barb's first bite off the plate, and made her eyes light up and she was almost rushing me to try a bite. The steak itself was pure silk on a plate. Warm, lucious, flavorful (uncommon for a filet!). Unfortunately, I do think that Barb's half of the filet was slightly more cooked, and came out mid-rare/medium, but mine was perfect.  Next, a small goat-cheese log stuffed with dried fruit, rolled in crushed nuts, and served with two pieces of baguette. The baguette had a wonderful quality of being crisp and light (like melba toast, but not as dry), without having a crust that was so hard as to be painful to the gums (as so many toasted baguettes do). Also on the plate were a few tiny slices of celery, and a small drop of wildflower honey. This is not your store-bought-in-a-bear-squeezy honey, but rather it was fragrant and flavourful, very sweet, and brought out a dessertlike quality to the cheese/nut/fruit/bread combination. Barb, I'm sure, would go to great lengths to find that honey again, she enjoyed it so much.  Lastly, the cheesecake course. When it arrived, it was small, and we both looked at eachother and said \"this is how cheesecake should be served\", not a huge slab that's a chore to work through, but a small indulgence at the end of the meal. It was rich, but fluffy, and so moist. None of that powdery or clumpy feel that you get at a factory. Served with a bourbon-vanilla-cream sauce on the plate. The sauce was sweet, complex, but not cloying. The cheesecake was sweet and rich, and I mopped that plate clean. But the whole course was never too much of anything, it was just a perfectly walked tight-rope, never too sweet or too rich, never too moist or too dry, but everything was executed wonderfully."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for an elegant dinner. The atmosphere is very nice.  A jacket is required and no cell phones are allowed in the dinning room.  This historic house is beautiful and well maintained. Much of the decor is original. The service was spectacular.   Despite the nice atmosphere, I wasn't very impressed with the food. We did the seven course Chef's tasting menu and ordered a bottle of wine. It was a nice experience, but the dessert (an upscale strawberry shortcake) was the best part of the meal.   Overall, it was good but not great. If you're interested in a romantic dinner in a charming home, I recommend Fig Tree. It's a similar experience with better food for less money."}
{"text":"Incredibly good service in a beautiful historic setting. Bring your appetite for the tasting menu,  it's a lot and very rich. Excellent new (for me) and creative dishes. Wesley running the wine pairings is also tremendous."}
{"text":"We went to this resturant for our anniversary. I loved the atmosphere.  It was like we had gone back into time.  I think that is the idea.  This is an old house with a lot of elegance.  The service was excellent.  We did the bistro menu which is three courses plus sorbet.  The first course was the best. Fried green tomato with a crab cake.  I have never had a fried green tomato like this one.  It was absolutely incredible. The crab cake was also excellent. The ribeye was OK. It wasn't my favorite part of the meal but it was good. I wasn't expecting such a smoked flavor.  The dessert was fabulous.  They gave me a rose and gave us glasses of champagne because it was our anniversary. Very romantic pace for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of REALLY nice places but the McNinch House left the biggest impression. I was really pleased with not only the food and decor but the level of care and professionalism demonstrated by Corey and Wesley. I went with a friend and we spent about $400. It was worth every penny. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to big groups unless you can keep the noise down. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"As a celebration for my birthday and a recent promotion, my wife and I ate here on Friday evening. One of the first reservations of the evening, we were able to be seated in the parlor next to a magnificent Christmas tree.   We chose the premier menu (Groupon helped) along with the wine pairing option. Pricey to be sure, but the latter took the evening from wonderful to memorable. It is clear from his excellent choices that our wine steward had taken the time to taste the foods we selected and expertly pair our wines. Each one was spot on and enhanced the courses with which they were paired.   For that special occasion with that special person, McNinch House is one of Charlotte's finest."}
{"text":"I need to start this by saying this all happened on a day they were supposed to be closed!  I spoke with the manager of the restaurant and explained that there was only one night that my party and I could have dinner due to our work schedule.  After whittling downtime the guest list down to 13, the chef and manager come up with an amazing array of courses.  Add a very knowledgeable sommelier and a detail oriented waitstaff and dining bliss was had by all!  Each course, every pairing was meticulously explained and prepared to perfection. During courses we were given the history of the building as well as a tour.  The only issue we had was that the evening couldn't last forever.  Cliché, sure.  But also very accurate.    I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the McNinch House Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 9 people.  We got the chef's tasting, which was a 9 courses.  The food was \"adequate,\" but for what they charge I should be dying to go back.  I expected a notch better for a 4-diamond establishment.  Specifically, I felt the salmon was overcooked.  I found that the filet was also a little more medium than I would have liked (I like medium-rare).  I wasn't asked how I wanted anything prepared, but was instead \"forced\" to trust the chef.  Honestly I would rather eat at Del Frisco's or The Fig Tree twice for what they charged.  If you like grandma's house, you'll love the décor in this place."}
{"text":"For those who haven't heard of it.. the McNinch House is a super fine dining restaurant located in one of the oldest houses in Charlotte, in fact... its even older than the Biltmore Estate.  At over 5,000 sqft the McNinch House once served as the Mayor's House and was even visited by President Theodore Roosevelt, William Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. We really loved the amount of detail throughout the house. Original chandeliers, trim and moldings  windows, etc... The McNinch House currently serves double duty as both a premier find dining location and the primary residence of Ellen Davis (the current owner of the McNinch House).  After a brief tour we were given our choice of seating... apparently we came on the slowest night of the week and only shared the evening with two other couples. We opted for the table with the most natural lighting hoping it would guarantee some good pics of all of the food... but by the time the food starting coming out it had started getting dark already.  Ella and I both started the night with a baby potato filled with a vanilla cream. The potato was tender and mixed nicely with the sweetness of the slightly melted cream. All this dish really needed was a dash of salt. Our first course started out with the Tomato Basil Soup, grilled white cheddar croutons, and extra virgin olive oil. Turns out the grilled white cheddar croutons were tiny grilled cheese sandwich squares and were pretty freaking delicious.  Then we tried the Jumbo-Lump Crab Cakes with a Louisiana-Style Remoulade Sauce and garnished with roasted pepper jam, crispy prosciutto, and braised mustard seeds. The crispy prosciutto was by far the best part of this appetizer and I would have been happy with just a plate full of that, but the crab cakes were good too!  After the apps we were served a corn muffin with butter that we thought was a little on the dry side. That was followed by a palate cleansing blackberry lime sorbet in a sugar rimmed glass. The sorbet was divine, but I have a hard time considering it a course.  Ella chose the Rosemary and Dijon Crusted Rack of New Zealand Lamb with chevre-arugala cous cous and glazed carrots for her entree. The lamb was cooked perfectly and had an awesome crunch thanks to the dijon and breadcrumb topping. I don't get the chance to eat a lot of cous cous, but after this dish I'm going to make it a point to. The cous cous itself was perfectly soft and tender which went great with the slight bite of the carrots and the creamy goat cheese. This might be one I have to try and recreate at our house.  I got the Coffee-Rubbed Filet of Ribeye topped with a red onion-bacon jam, duchesse potato, whipped lima beans, and a veal demi-glace. I know this will probably shock most of you... but I HATE COFFEE. So my coffee-rubbed filet of ribeye came without the coffee part. The best part of the plate easily the slightly sweet and savory red onion-bacon jam. The worst... for me was the whipped lima beans, but that's probably because I don't like lima beans to begin with. The duchesse potato was pretty good but I would have easily traded its beautiful presentation for a larger quantity and the veal demi-glace paled in comparison to the red onion-bacon jam.  We started the dessert courses with the Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting, White Chocolate-Brown Sugar Mousse, Carrot-Olive Oil Puree, and Valencia Orange Gelée.  The carrot cake flavor left a little to be desired, but the orange gelée was awesome and I give the chef props for creativity. Beth's Pecan Pie with maple bacon ice cream, powdered sugar, and fresh whipped cream was hands down the better of the two desserts. The pie was both sticky and gooey... just as any good pecan pie should be. The maple bacon ice cream was also really good and added a bit of fun to a traditional dessert, but I hated the little rolled cookie.  Overall.. I guess we would say we liked the McNinch House. I don't think they had the best food in Charlotte for our palate but they've been awarded 15th consecutive Four Diamond designation from AAA and are listed as one of the top \"extraordinary\" restaurants in America by Zagat's Dining Guide, which would make me think that obviously a lot of people enjoy the restaurant. We had a great dinner, thought the service was A+, and absolutely loved the history of the house... but I still think comparing just food to food, there might be a couple of other places better in the Queen City."}
{"text":"First time, dinner for five. Unique setting, slow paced meal with no urgency, which was nice, but it could also be exasperating for some. The food was good, not top level, but no complaints. Nothing stood out as \"incredible\" or \"best ever\" but all very well done. The wait staff was nice, if a bit slow. Wines are over-priced but they have a good selection. Two bottles of cab and dinner, plus mandatory 20% tip, was over $1000. They have an annoying oversight though, they actually charge 20% on the tip as well as food and wine. It is either lack of attention to detail, ignorance, or a desire to milk the last couple of dollars out of the transaction. Even though the meal was pleasurable, paying a tip on my tax is not acceptable. So, we won't be back until they correct that issue and you should be aware of the problem before making a reservation."}
{"text":"We had a 5-course meal and wine pairings.  The wine is why I gave it 2-stars; otherwise would've been worse as food was very bland.  No creativity to the cooking.  I enjoy extremely nice meals but McNinch is way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Went for a romantic dinner with my wife. Excellent food. Chose the 5 course selection. Delightful service, knowledgeable waiters, amazing food. We decided to pair cocktails with our pre, main and dessert courses. It was a wonderful choice. I highly recommend the duck and salmon. In fact, I recommend everything they have. Will definitely be returning. If you can, take a quick tour of the house, it is beautiful. Although, the classical music playing is somewhat cliche of a 1980s movie scene where a ragamuffin walks in and every turns and looks at them, it is very classy. All in all, please make this restaurant your choice for a celebration; let it be an anniversary or a birthday. If you have any questions, the staff will be more than glad to assist you."}
{"text":"Excellent. Phenomenal service and fantastic food. Wine pairings were amazing. Loved all 7 courses and pairings!   Pumpkin soup, filet, vegetable medley and cheese courses were the stand outs."}
{"text":"If you're over 65 and you want to feel important, this is a great spot for you and your significant other. If you have common sense, you know there are better places to spend this kind of money in Charlotte for high caliber dishes. That being said, all the food was good. Not great, but good. One strange thing happened, our meal was paid for in advance by a friend and we were offered wine by our server. Turns out, that wine was not included and was a $300 bottle. A heads up would have been nice before they popped the cork and handed us the check: That was shady McNinch House. I've eaten all over the world never had that \"miscommunication.\" Also, don't go around back side of the restaurant- it's not pretty like the front. It's all for show I guess. Sigh."}
{"text":"We went to the Mcninch House last Wednesday for yet another work dinner (no complaints here)!! There was 5 of us in our party and we had this beautiful Old Victorian House to ourselves!! We were the only reservation they had that evening the server insisted they were fully booked the rest of the week though!  If you have never been or never heard of them before, they ask for you and your party to call in how many courses and what entree choice you would like the day before so that they can plan a menu specifically for your party. We opted for the \"Premiere\" which was the 5 courses for $79 each.  The house was beautifully decorated with a Christmas tree in each room each with a different theme. Very warm and of course a lot of history!   I chose the Braised Coq au Vin  wrapped in Prosciutto served with couscous and a mushroom reduction...it was dry edible but dry. I only got that so that everyone was eating something different! I should have chosen the Osso Bucco!! Everyone else loved their entrees!!  I really enjoyed everything that they served before it. I just was not blown away by any of it.  I feel that the ambiance was what really won me over and if I were ever to go back it would again be on my Boss' dime!!"}
{"text":"Me and my daughter had  dinner there and we didn't get a tour or the history explained about the establishment. I felt a very racist vibe from this restaurant and wouldn't go back. Now with that being said the food was horrible left more to be desired ... tasteless and bland for the amount of money you pay one would expect better tasting food... I told waiter to put my main course in a doggy bag because I didn't want to be too full as we were going to a movie after ... once I arrived home looking for my food ?! Nothing he didn't put my food in the bag only my daughter's key lime pie and her leftovers were in the bag. $245 meal Smh Never Again."}
{"text":"We had the 5 course dinner last night. The restaurant is cute and has sweet decor. However, the meal was terrible. My husband and I commented that it might have been the worst meal we've ever had. The octopus was sandy and flavorless. The lettuce was gritty. Crab cake was unremarkable. My duck was fatty, over cooked and inedible. My husband had chocolate mousse which was like a bowl of whipped cream with cocoa powder. I never leave reviews but this meal was so terrible. What a horrible and expensive way to spend my birthday. The only highlight was Wesley who clearly knew his wine. $400 for 2 people (with wine). They add in 20% gratuity. I will never be back!!"}
{"text":"Ill start my review by stating that ive been working in the food industry for 7 years now, all fine dining.  I know what works and what doesnt, and what i should expect when eatting at places. With that being said.  My wife and dined here and i was very disappionted with the over all experiance.  I think the thing that bothered me the most was the wine manager, after saying that we would be hving a 6 course dinner and would not be pairing it with the wine but would be ordering individual glasses of wine and cocktails he just lost all interest in providing an enjoyable experiance.  After ordering our first drinks and finishing it, a manhattan for myself and champagne for her i was asked if we would like another drink; which i agreed to. instead of bringing out the wine menu again i was made to just state what type of wine i would like, the sommelier brought a glass of cab and just dropped it at the table- no mention of year, make, and region, just a heres a glass of wine, i didnt know if it was a 5 dollar a bottle wine or a 35 dollar a glass wine, nothing. And on top of it all it was corked.  Luckally they removed it and took it off the bill, they brought out another and the som just dropped it off again, i had to stop him before he walked away and ask what he just gave us, he repllied a cabernet. I litterally had to prompt him with \" where does it come from, when was it made, who makes it.\"  If i could grade just the som i would give him a zero, the man has given up on even trying to provide for his clients.  Getting into the food, it was ok not worth what we paid for, the amuse was enjoyable, as well as the duck which was cooked perfectly, but the other 4 courss were average. The smoked sweet potato puree, coupled with the beef and sauce was just way too sweet, totally killed the meat.  I think what put the nail in the coffin while eatting here was the check at the end.  They automatically add 20% gratutity to the bill, it doesnt matter what type of service you get. With the staff already nowing they are getting theirs is it any wonder they could care less. Four star 4 diamond yea right."}
{"text":"I am going to keep this simple. My wife and I ate dinner at the McNinch house for our 5 year anniversary. The place was so slow. The valet guy was our waiter and bus boy. (probably the chef also, but not positive) The food was ok at the best. $300 and we both left and ate pizza. Enough said?"}
{"text":"One of a kind dining experience! Very expensive but worth experiencing once in your lifetime for a memorable occasion."}
{"text":"Some anniversary spots we've tried: Barrington's, McNinch, George's Brasserie.  We thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience here."}
{"text":"A classic, vintage ambiance set in a house turned historic landmark, paired with the chef's tasting menu and Bourdeaux wine complement, made for the perfect belated birthday dinner. The best way to describe a dining experience at McNinch is to feel lost in a dining whirlwind of pure, blissful happiness with the perfect pair of ruby slippers yet no desire to be found.   We began our dinner with Wagyu Tartar, Seared Scallops and Foie Gras as opening courses. The Wagyu Tartar had the perfect texture that simply melted in my mouth. While I enjoyed the scallops, it was nothing out of the ordinary. It was the Foie Gras that warmed my heart. The dish came with a whipped chestnut puree, crispy arugula, and a caramelized onion pound cake. The flavors complemented oh so well and the texture was absolutely perfect. After our opening courses, we received complimentary sorbet as a palate cleanser. DELICIOUS.  For our main courses, we got the Rosemary and Dijon Crusted Rack of New Zealand Lamb and Beef Stroganoff. Both were divine, but I would have to say the Lamb was my favorite of the two. Each piece of lamb was cooked to perfection and complemented well with the parsley couscous ad onion jus. The flavors of the stroganoff blended perfect, but the homemade truffle pasta was definitely the highlight.  On to my favorite part of every meal, DESSERT! We landed on the Chia Panna Cotta and the Baked Alaska Flambe. While both were way too beautiful to devour, their beauty only helped delay long enough for pictures. The Baked Alaska Flambe was completely submerged in whipped cream and then completely toasted with Italian Meringue, lemon and chocolate ice cream simmering inside. My absolute favorite was definitely the Panna Cotta. Presented as a terrarium, a mini pink rose sat in the center with Nutella powder sprinkled all around and honey and ginger caviar subtly placed throughout.   With a single rose and complimentary champagne to help celebrate, I genuinely thank you McNinch for such an amazing experience!"}
{"text":"They have free valet parking . The house is beautiful and cozy. The wait staff were very nice and professional. Got history of the house , which was cool. The food exceptional. Was given a cantaloupe gazpacho to starts things off. Yummy! I had crab cakes and a beet salad for starters. Wonderful! Then green apple sorbet before the main course, beautifully presented with a punk sugar rim. Had the grouper as a main course with polenta. Amazing !!! The dessert was chocolate and out of this world ! Best restaurant I have eaten at in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Beware. MCNinch house has most of its truly honest reviews removed. I reviewed this in December commenting on the high price relative to the nature and quantity of food received - this review was unfortunately consistent with 4 others basically indicating the same thing and imagine my surprise when i noticed that ALL of the negative reviews were removed. Have we learned nothing from Travelocity and Mexico?? Btw - it's only 5 stars to prevent it from getting removed. Save your money eat elsewhere - better value."}
{"text":"We returned after 7 years and we were happy to see the server from many years ago also serve us yet again. Warm, hospitable and knowledgeable in wines he paired all our meals with the perfect choices. Seven delicious courses over a three hour period that we'd do all over again in a NY minute. Great evening and money well spent."}
{"text":"The lamb chops ..... What can I say just simply amazing... This restaurant does not disapoint..Well worth it."}
{"text":"After driving almost daily by The McNinch House for 7 years, we gave them an opportunity to celebrate our anniversary with them.   Fantastic 3 hours with my bride of 36 years!   Service: 5+ stars.  Food:  a solid 4 stars.   I could nit-pick (and for the $$$ tab I'm entitled); however,  the entire staff was kind,  engaging,  knowledgable, and attentive.   I would've given a greater tip (a flat 20% is added on the bill), but there was not an extra line to charge my card.   Bravo for such a wonderful and memorable evening!"}

On Wednesday the week of the Saturday seating, they email you a list of choices for the six (yes six) courses.  You send them back in, and when you arrive, the meal is already planned.  It is located in the historic district of Charlotte in a home built in 1891. The theme is for you to enjoy a meal the old fashioned way with ample time for all courses in a relaxed and luxurios southern mansion setting.  There is only one seating at each of the 6 tables per evening. The tables are spread throughout the home, so you feel you have your own room.  Each room is elegantly decorated in Victorian style.  We sat in the room shown in the upper right on theri website.   They have a dress code that requires jackets for gentlemen (tie at your option), and ask ladies to wear something classy.  Upscale for sure, and a hoot to dress up for the evening.   So many niceties abound, it is hard to think of McNinch House as a restaurant, but more like a royalty experience. Candles galore, soft classical music, table settings reserved for heads of state as attention to detail and your dining enjoyment is the only goal of the owner.   Chef and Owner Ellen Davis combines French, Southern and European styles to create a \"Continental\" menu. They are known for our Roasted Rack of Lamb with Fresh Rosemary and Dijon Mustard Crust as well as their Pecan-Crusted Baked Salmon with a Red Bell Pepper and Lime Sauce.

{"text":"I'm so torn about this review, but I cannot lie. I mean really torn. My first time here and I'm all about nostalgia, history, a story, and going to nicer restaurants for the experience. I think this hits a lot of those. I'm just so disappointed in the food. The servers were good, nice and engaging when we asked questions, there is no problem there. Rebecca specifically stood out and told us a little more about the history of the home and the families that owned it and some features of the house. Everyone was nice and they kept the table ready for the next course and our drinks full. Ok great, good we got the foundation covered.  On to the wine/food...  The sommelier was out of town and that's totally fine. But no one really knew much about the wine when we asked questions. Instead of a bottle, we just got glasses of wine and could have spent more money and drank more. But limited us to two for only 2 of the 4 in our group. They do have a fairly decent selection of wine.   We ordered the 6 cheese plate and it was good no complaints, except I wish we had more honey and jam to go with each bite.  For a 5 course meal I would have expected so much more from a flavor and execution standpoint. So for myself specifically, I initially wanted the 7 course meal which included extra cheese and an extra opener. Since we were in a time crunch, I just said hey I'm gonna go back down to a 5 course and cancel the other two and they said no problem. In the 5 course you get 2 openers, sorbet, a main course, and dessert. My opener courses I got the crab cake and she crab soup. I liked both. Not amazing, but I liked it. Great presentation on both. When I wanted the stuff fried squash blossom, they said they ran out. I really didn't want anything else on the my openers, but fine and I ended up not even getting a 3rd so I guess it worked out. The sorbet palette cleanser was nice and refreshing with the sugar rim on the square bowl.  The main dish I chose was the rack of New Zealand lamb.  First off I wanted it medium and to me that's a little pink, but it came out rare. Check my picture. I actually sent it back but not for the color, for the actual temperature of the lamb. It was cold!!! I felt embarrassed sending it back, but I'm not paying $100, 5 course meal for cold Lamb. The crusting of it was fine, nothing spectacular. They heated it up and was still not hot, but warm. I asked why and they said it was because \"you asked us to put it on rush.\" I don't think rushing the searing of Lamb made it cold. I've cooked plenty of Lamb myself and it doesn't take that long to cook, but bringing it out cold is just unacceptable and rare, not medium. Fine I ate it anyways.  On to the dessert. I got the blackberry cobbler and it was hotter temperature wise than my Lamb. And not bad, wish it had more ice cream in it. U  Nothing at all jumped out and was like wow this is so good or wow this is amazing. I just didn't get excited about it.   My friends meal....The friends I was with had the pan seared duck, this was also not cooked correctly to what we asked for. And it wasn't that great. No one at the table finished every single course and I left hungry. The chocolate mousse and key lime pie desserts were also not good at all.   I'm not about price or complaining on what costs what. It's an experience, but seriously how do you charge $100 for a 5 course meal and nothing wow'd me or anyone at my table??? I am just disappointed in the overall food experience. Anyone can have history and a cool place, but if they can't follow it up with the right food to match it doesn't make sense. I'm glad I went, maybe it was an off night, but nothing amazed me and made me remember the dinner. I honestly will not be back and it makes me so sad to say because I think it could have been so much better."}
{"text":"The ambiance is wonderful and romantic. It's completely charming adorable and I almost felt like a princess. Our service was excellent.   The problem is that the portions are so tiny that we were practically hungry when our courses were finished. I'm well aware that in fine dining establishments the portions tend to be small. I've been to enough very high end restaurants to understand that. However, McNinch House gives teeny tiny, sad little portions. It's just not acceptable and we felt ripped off. Yes, the food was outstanding but we won't return. Such a shame to spend over $200 for two people and still be practically hungry."}
{"text":"Ambience was spectacular. Service was pleasant. Food was mediocre. I walked in expecting an expensive evening, but did not expect to be charged for water and have gratuity added. We were not pleased that we arrived at 630pm on a Wednesday (for our reservation) and did not leave until 840pm (seated the whole time). We were also not offered the Wednesday special (we found out from a table next to us after it was to late to order). Unexpectedly dissatisfied after hearing so many great things about this restaurant. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Classical French/American fusion, honestly the best part of the whole experience was the house itself-built by the same craftsmen who built the Biltmore house! We were torn between the \"premier\" menu or the mysterious chef tasting menu for $200 per person... we went with the chef's tasting, which turned it to be pretty much the exact same thing as the \"premier\" menu, with the addition of a sorbet before entrees and a hard as a rock potato hockey puck with a fallow of cold goat cheese on top. Service was top tier-and Wesley, the wine consultant, did a fantastic job of explaining and recommending wines we were floored by his knowledge and enthusiasm about wines. Each wine was different, complex, amazing!!! Perfectly paired with each dish. 3 stars only because the dishes were just very classical, nothing to write home about. Traditional fare for someone used to American fine dining, no risks or new concepts-which is fine. Smoked ice cream with dessert was the most unique item served and definitely served as a perfect and different night cap."}
{"text":"Such a wonderful find in Charlotte for a date night with the hubby! The house is gorgeous, dining in a Victorian style home with amazing details to catch the eyes are simply everywhere. From the paintings on the walls to the chinaware, it's the details that enhanced the meal.  Kudos to the chef for his use of garden herbs grown on property, and the wine pairings were perfection."}
{"text":"Food and service was great. The reason for the 3 stars is that they add a 20% tip without letting know. I have no problem paying a 20% tip but would like to know that I am so that I dont add an additional 20%. It was not until we asked to get a breakdown of the bill that it showed that it was on there. Very miss leading and unprofessional!!"}
{"text":"If you want a truly formal experience with food to match the McNinch House is the place. The overall experience is tough to beat until you get your check with the 20% tip on the entire bill including tax, included!! This is Charlotte, NC not NYC. While the serendipitous evening may well be worth a 20% gratuity, that should be my decision not one mandated by the restaurant's management."}
{"text":"So we've seen this place on lists for Charlotte fine dining and based on romantic/kitschy decor we decided to try for our 10 year anniversary. Like others I am not excited to write this review as the decor was fine for what they are going for and overall generally nice people.  For a 5 course meal and the price associated with it one would expect something more than extremely mediocre and slim portions. And with two melon ball sorbet scoops being counted as a \"course.\" Last I recall that is considered a palate cleanser in tasting courses.   I won't get into the details of each course but can definitively say that if you want to splurge $400+ for two people (bottle of wine and 5 course)-There are plenty of restaurants (maybe not in Charlotte) but around the world where you can get your money's worth and  feel like the splurge was worth it. This meal should have been no more that $150-175.  Ambiance is nice- kitschy/corny but nice and people were nice- just in no way worth anywhere near to what they charge. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday because I've heard such great things about it. Was fully prepared to dish out a good deal of money but I was okay with that because it was for a special occasion.  I had heard great things about this place from friends and family who have been over the years. But what I failed to realize is that the people telling me the great things had not been back in at least 5 years.   I was expecting amazing food and service (especially for the price). We got the Chef's tasting with the wine pairing. So it was going to be about a $400 meal for two. The food was average at best. The service was awful. Our waitress knew nothing about the menu and was a little too casual for such a high class place.  The upside is that the wine was great and the guy serving the wine was very knowledgeable and friendly! Another upside is that my boyfriend was disappointed with the meal that he said something to the manager in private and she felt very bad about the subpar experience so took a $100 off our bill.   I really do hope they step their game back up. Because from what I've heard it used to be quite the experience to go here for a great, high-end meal."}
{"text":"The setting is lovely and the staff friendly, but the food is not what you expect from a resturant of this caliber. The flavor profile on each dish was off and odd. The steak was overcooked. The cheesecake looked and tasted like it was a store bought frozen dessert. Very disappointing and unexceptable for a resturant rated this high. Yes, it's romantic, but for $79.00 per person prefixed entrees with $16-18 wines, that are also very average, it's not worth it. There are far better resturants in charlotte with romantic atmospheres."}
{"text":"Amazing, the food and service were great. I would highly recommend this place. We went to try it because we saw it on Groupon. It is a little pricey, but definitely worth every penny. They do have a full bar as wel as someone to walk you through an amazing wine selection of you choose to go that way."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great.  First class service, all around.  Wonderful staff.  The food just fell a little short of expectation.  Don't get me wrong, the food is VERY GOOD.  It's just that nothing we had was extraordinary.  However, the wine pairing we had with our 5 course meal was outstanding.  Great all around experience, it's a perfect romantic date spot, but I'm honestly not eager to go back soon.  Again, because the food wasn't as spectacular as anticipated."}
{"text":"Of course I cant afford a real meal here but to feel part of the ELITE I go for the wine tastings!!!  They are almost every other Monday, sometimes they will have them outside but usually they are inside their spectacular dining rooms.  Yes, the house is stunning and historic if you like antiques and victorian style decor.  The wine tastings are $20 bucks per person and include usually 7 or so wines and heavy apps.  You can wander throughout the downstairs or on the peaceful porch with your wine.  It is the perfect Monday happy hour!  Love you McNinch!!!  :-D"}
{"text":"Can't even begin to describe this place.  First off, the house itself is incredible.  A throwback to craftsmanship construction and not a detail left unattended.    Regarding the food, there's not another place in Charlotte that can even come close to it in my opinion.  We were here celebrating and decided on the Chef's Tasting menu which is a 9-course dinner and I'm not going to belabor you all with the details of each and every dish.  I'll just say that the dishes were thoughtful, creative and cooked to perfection with the touch of a culinary artist.  The service was impeccable and not once did we feel rushed to finish or hurry along.  When you reserve here, you basically have the table for the night and that's a good thing because our dinner was over the span of 3 hours (slightly more).  We did chat it up a bit with the staff though.  Parking is valet only and is directly behind the house.  Bottom line, McNinch is a must do for locals and people visiting alike."}
{"text":"When you travel to different states and explore local gems, you definitely would like to find something like this unique restaurant. Imagine that you're going back in time and you have fine dinning in the very sofisticated way with all this old  anturage, interior, amazing food and service. I would definitely recommend this place to visit. Wine tasting and paring was great! I'll come back"}
{"text":"Came here for a private function/total buy-out with about forty people and was a bit disappointed.  This was not a four star dining experience.  It was a very pleasant service experience, friendly and not too stuffy and you could tell they really have a lot of pride for the place.  I actually feel bad about giving them a negative review because they seem like really nice people.    And the house is very old and interesting but that's not the definition of four star. Grandma's china and chilled forks and old fashioned service was adequate but certain things just put it off; like the dingy rugs in the bathroom and the shabby landscaping and I don't know what all actually.  Just felt a little amateurish.  I did really enjoy the pear salad but the mushroom soup starter was cold and what really loses the stars for me is the mediocre entree of undercooked pork and tough steak.  Really disappointing.  I loved the sweet potato puree that came with it but it was the only flavor on the plate.  And that undercooked pork was inedible and I don't even mind a little pink.  This was raw in the center and mine wasn't the only one.  No one wanted to complain as it was a customer event.  But I would have sent it back if I were on my own.  The desert was your typical banquet style flourless chocolate cake but no coffee was offered.  Which may have been the planners fault but I really could have used some.  Overall, a pleasant experience but doesn't live up to the reviews or the price tag.  My guess is they do much better for a standard service rather than a banquet service of 40 people."}
{"text":"My wife and I went last night to celebrate our 35 wedding anniversary. The meal, service and staff were nothing short of superb. Thank you for a wonderful night."}
{"text":"Long time Charlotte establishment McNinch House is a dining experience, not just a restaurant. Located in a beautiful Fourth Ward Victorian house, you are dining in an elegant setting. Make sure that you really like the person you're with because an evening at McNinch House is an investment in time. Enjoy yourself - do not feel rushed - pace your beverages - dinner will definitely take a while.  My dining partner and I chose the four course dinner. There are options that offer additional courses as well as wine parings if you wish. Wine is also available by the glass, bottle and as flights.   We chose crab cakes as our first course. When the plates were served, I thought I was seeing two small biscuits on the plate (yes, the lighting is somewhat dim.) The crab cakes were beautiful and wonderful. The two crab cakes were predominantly chunks of crab with very little seasoning, dusted with a soft flour and very lightly browned. They were served with a lightly dressed slaw and the combination was right on. Perfect.   Being in a crab state of mind, we chose she crab soup for our second course. The creme fraiche made in house really added to the flavor of this dish. The small addition of sherry was just right.  My companion and I parted company with the entree. She had the rack of lamb and I chose the duck breast. The rack of lamb was cooked to perfection, nicely displayed and exactly what she expected. My duck breast was also perfectly cooked. It was served with a cherry reduction and sweet potato hash.   For dessert, we chose their evening's cheesecake. Thinking I would receive the normal size portion, I thought I would be wasting much of my dessert. When the plates arrived, I was very pleased to see a beautiful, small portion. The flavor was wonderful. I ate the whole thing! It was just right.  With one exception, the food was five stars. Unfortunately I detected a slight burned flavor in the cherry reduction. It was about 30 seconds too cooked. But that was not enough to ruin the whole food experience.  My greater concern involved service. McNinch House is a first class restaurant. I didn't feel like the service was first class for these reasons: we arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation time. The door was locked and after a while we were met at the door by one of the servers. We felt awkward when he said for us to wait and look around if we wished. I would have preferred him to take my coat then and offer to take a drink order. The waiting was not a problem, the awkwardness was. Secondly, the servers did not stick with the tried and true rules of which side to serve and from which side to remove plates. In several instances the servers crossed in front of us to remove something from the table in spite of the fact there was plenty of room behind both of us. Lastly, I don't mind an automatic gratuity and I don't object to a 20% gratuity since I normally tip that amount anyway. What I do object to is tipping on the taxed amount. This means I am tipping on more than 20% and I don't think that is right at all.  I hope to someday return to McNinch House. I do recommend this restaurant with some reservation (but not the food - it was wonderful.)"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. It was spectacular. Service was attentive and engaging and Mr Wesley was a fantastic wealth of knowledge on wines and truly enjoyed his job. We did the chefs tasting menu with the wine pairing. It was the best meal we have eaten in the Charlotte area by far. Special occasion worthy for anything!"}
{"text":"The McNinch house is located in the Fourth Ward neighborhood (my favorite part of Charlotte.) The front yard is so inviting with it's warm lighting and shaded trees along the sidewalks. It's surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the city, but once you walk through the gates, it's as if the city doesn't exist. It's cozy, charming and historical.  If you want to feel like a princess for one night, this place will make it all seem so real. It's one of the most romantic restaurants in Charlotte. It's worth every penny and something you must experience at least once in your life. If you're thinking that it's \"too fancy\" or \"I don't belong\", well that's probably true. I definitely didn't belong in a place like this (Sometime eat salad with my fingers), but they'll make you feel like you're the most important person to ever walked through their doors to dine. Even though it's extremely elegant and fancy, you never once get the \"hoity-toity\" attitude. You're simply graced with southern hospitality at it's finest.  We weren't in the mood for alcohol, so we skipped out on the wine, but I must mention that they are known for their selection and knowledge of fine-quality wine. If you are a wine connoisseur, this is your place. Wes, the wine steward, is a pretty big deal. He's been working in the industry for twenty-one years and has trained at the New York's Windows on the World Win School. I believe he's worked at the McNinch house for thirteen years. He was so pleasant and loved to joke around. He gave us a little history lesson on the house.  All of the ceilings and woodwork in the house were so eye-catching. I couldn't stop starring at all the detail. It was handcrafted by the same man who designed a lot of the woodwork at the Biltmore. I love the touches of purple throughout the house, indicating it's royalty and elegance. The detail did not go unnoticed. Some people may think that the classical music in the background is too cliche, but I appreciated it. I loved the mood it set and the pieces playing were beautiful and calming.  The only complaint I have is that everything on the menu sounded so decadent, that it was hard to choose. They reassured us that the one thing they don't do there is rush, so we could take our time looking at the menu. And if you don't know what something is, just ask because the staff is so informative and know everything about their menu. They don't educate themselves for nothing. They are more than delighted to assist you in anyway. You're royal, remember?  The food is incredible. The chefs are talented and artistic! Everything we ate was wonderful! Check out my blog for all food photos and thoughts!  I loved that our dinner was long and enjoyable. There was no waiting in-between courses. Once we were done with one course (on our time) they'd grab the plates from table and serve the next course within seconds. The dinner was at our pace and never rushed, or too slow. I call that a good course flow.  http://simplytaralynn.com/2016/08/16/dined-like-royals-mcninch-house/  Read the rest of my review at the link above for my food descriptions and thoughts!"}
{"text":"Bullet points:  Took my wife for our anniversary dinner.  Did the 5 course meal.   Food was Good, but not great (especially given the price). I had the steak and my wife had the Lamb (lamb was a bit overdone).  As per usual, with an upscale place such as this, the wine list was overpriced. (but that's not a huge deal)  Ambiance is very cool,  inside is very old school Victorian.  Enjoyed seeing the details of the home.  (1 complaint, the chairs for dinner are not traditional dining chairs and by the end were very uncomfortable).  Service was in my opinion was just \"ok\".  Seemed to take a while in the very beginning for anyone to offer to take a drink order.  I enjoy taking my time when having a nice dinner; I never like being rushed between courses, HOWEVER, this 5 course meal took from start to finish 3 hours.  (that was the only really frustrating part of this experience:  had it been shortened by 30 mins or more, I would probably lean toward 4 stars, but still doubtful).  For me, there are better places in charlotte to spend your money.  Glad I went, but probably won't go back.   Quick Shoutout to the woman how sat behind us who felt it OK to blow her nose for 2.5 hours while we ate."}
{"text":"Went here with the groupon on a Tuesday night.  It was definitely worth it and the service, Wesley, was great.  My favorite part of the 5 course meal was the crab cake appetizer. Absolute perfection.  My boyfriend and I tried the watermelon radish salad, artichoke bisque, she crab soup, sorbet. crab cake and jumbo shrimp app, lamb entree, duck entree, cheesecake and the chèvre plate.  All meals were delicious.    Wesley even gave us a free $35 glass of wine because I told him I didn't like sweet wine. He wanted to prove that sweet wine is amazing but the fact of it is that I just don't like sweet wine.    The only reason I give it 4/5 is because it says there is valet but when you pull up we were confused by the sign and no one came out even though we waited.  We parked anyways in the back and walked in and didn't get greeted.  We had to ask another man what we were supposed to do.  So it took awhile to get started but once we were settled everything was amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!  I can't think of one negative thing to say about this place!  My husband took me here for my 27th birthday, and it was a perfect night!  We got the 7 course meal, and every course was better than the last!  Definitely a \"splurge\" type of place for us, but we will be back for sure!  Hands down, the best restaurant in Charlotte...and we've been to a lot of great places!"}
{"text":"The dining rooms are beautiful and elegant the service impeccable thank you wesley the food was really good would have been 5 stars but my lamb was tough would recommend the salmon instead the chocolate creme Brule was the best I've had yes it's expensive but worth the experience!"}
{"text":"So...it's been at least two years since I've been to McNinch and I still remember the experience like it was yesterday. And I have to agree with Bill on this one, it's pretty amazing.  Hubs and I decided to try this illustrious resto for Valentine's Day in 2008, we went through the whole reservation process, custom menu, custom wine pairings - the whole shebang. We actually followed all their directions to a t and arrive early, enjoyed some champagne while taking a tour of the sweet little home/restaurant on Church St. And then the incredible began...  We were blown away (for the entire 3+ hours) by the spectacular pairings of food and wine, accompanied by fantastic service. I know we saved our menu for quite some time, but I'm not sure where it ran off to. Every single course was creatively prepared and tons of local ingredients were immersed into the dishes. Our server was also extremely knowledgable in each wine, explaining its heritage and vineyard to us.   Since we choose the wine pairing option, we quite literally had a different (and interesting) glass of wine with every of the seven courses. Good thing we lived in the Fourth Ward at that time. Hey-oo!  McNinch House is such a special place to experience an amazing meal. It's pricey and well worth every penny: I'm still talking about my meal 2.5 years later. We probably spent about $400 all in, including the wine pairings for each of us, seven courses and tip. An expensive meal for sure, but it's wonderful for a anniversary or milestone celebration."}
{"text":"Easily the best and most romantic restaurant in Charlotte!! This tiny establishment has THE HIGHEST rating in Charlotte (they are a five star -four diamond). The chief is amazing and always willing to change the menu around to fit your needs. I hate sweet potato but decided to try their sweet potato appetizer and it was to die for. The staff are extremely attentive and very delightful. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a night to remember!!"}
{"text":"As I always say, it's a shame that virtually every restaurant in Charlotte seems to be rated as 4s, as most aren't deserving of 4+ stars. Either way, this restaurant is true of deserving at least 4 stars. So, if you don't want to deal with hoity toity multiple course service (followed by the price) then probably not the place for you. But if you can get past the haute demeanor of the place (or at least you don't mind/want it) then it's well worth it.  I would have given exactly 4.5 stars. The absolute only thing I would say took it down is that while the food was flavorful, they were slightly heavy on the salt and my grouper was slightly on the dry side. I do want to remark that the crab cake beginning course was OUTSTANDING. McNinch=worthy of going."}
{"text":"A historical dining experience that we wanted to have before we moved out of the area.   Gorgeous home on church street-downstairs is restaurant, upstairs is a private residence. Built in 1889 the home has a beautiful garden and sitting wrap around porch.   You have a choice of 5-9 courses to choice from on the menu. Ranging from meat to fish with heavy weight put on southern favorites like she-crab soup, local fish, greens and cheeses. Small portions and nothing very outstanding except the crab cake-be sure to get that.   The setting is beyond elegant with damask table clothes, fine china, crystal and antique silver. Tip- use the multiple utensils from the outside in!  Staff is formal but friendly but, be prepared for the jacket required dress code. The prices are very expensive. All in all worth the experience, food was good but you do pay for it!   **The 20% gratuity added to the bill was ridiculous if the staff already knows they have that tip-what is the incentive to go the extra mile?"}
{"text":"Wonderful meal. We enjoyed the Crab appetizer, Duck and Snapper entrees, all delicious. Next visit I will definitely try the chefs tasting menu. Don't be put off by the number of courses, the portions are small."}
{"text":"I have been several times for special occasions. I am never disappointed at the food or service. This place knows fine dinning. You dont go for a quick meal. Its all about the experience at this restaurant. Absolutely do the wine pairing."}
{"text":"It is has been over a month since my visit to the McNinch House, and the reason for the delay is due to the fact I was torn on my review.  But, unfortunately the more I thought about the entire experience the more I know it was just OK.  In honor or my Mother's birthday I decided to take her to McNinch for the 5 course tasting menu.  We arrived for our 7:00pm reservations and loved the atmosphere, a quaint house with a nice setting for a private, special occasion dinner.  Being a Saturday night I was surprised to see only one other occupied table in our room and only two tables in the other room.  Where was everyone?   The McNinch House offers a variety of dining options, 5 course, 7 courses and a Chef's Tasting menu with the option to add wine pairings to your experience.  We decided to go with the 5 course tasting menu, and after looking over the menu were very excited with the options and even more our selections. I started off with the She Crab Soup and the Crab Cake.  All I can say is the She Crab Soup is a Must Have and honestly the only real highlight of my dining experience.  The Crab Cake was not memorable at all and I can say I really didn't even taste crab.  For my entree I chose the Filet, medium.  Unfortunately that was overcooked and I have had better filets at some chain restaurants...Sorry. My Mother started with the Pear Salad and the Scallops, which she enjoyed both. Unfortunately she wanted the Foie Gras but they didn't have it available that night, which was a huge disappointment.  For her entree she chose the Truffle Pasta, which was undercooked and had no flavor. Where were the truffles? As for the desserts, we ordered the Cheesecake and Baked Alaska, both okay.  Overall, the entire meal was somewhat of a disappointment, mainly when it came to the taste of the food. I guess I expected more or maybe it was an off night???  I have been to a few other restaurants for birthdays, anniversaries, etc and would definitely return rather than visit McNinch again."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary. We were the only people in the entire restaurant. I understand the historical feel that they are going for but everything was very dirty. The decor is cheesy and nothing was clean. Dirty silverware and glasses. We went with 5 courses. Food was lackluster and the scallops and risotto was gross. No way anything was fresh since no one dined in there other than us that night. And the risotto was FROZEN in the middle. Until they clean it up and cook the food- I will not be back"}
{"text":"This place is something else! My boyfriend and I were in town to see Amy Schumer and a former Charlotte local recommended we try McNinch House. The concept- a historic house/restaurant- sounded a little strange when he suggested, but the experience was so unique and tastefully done.    The menu was fun because you choose from a pre-fixed menu, but you can also decide the number of courses. By far, the best part of the meal was the wine pairing. The wine steward did a phenomenal job with the food/wine pairings AND he was super generous with extra pours- we definitely walked out of there feeling good ;) My boyfriend hardly cares about wine and even he was snapping pictures of bottles he liked. Service all around was great... This is the kind of place where you come back to the table and find your napkin all folded up to look like a little peacock.   Lastly, we went around the holidays and it was decorated just beautifully; each of the dining rooms had a gorgeous Christmas tree. Highly recommended around the holidays!!"}
{"text":"This dinner was wonderful! The food was delicious! The portions were bigger than I expected, my cut of salmon was huge. I loved the atmosphere. They used china and actual silver for silverware. The service was great, the right amount of attention without being at our table every five seconds. I also loved the dress attire. All the men wore coats and all the ladies were dressed very nicely as well. Not a pair of jeans in sight! My boyfriend wore a suit, no tie and I wore a cocktail dress. While I am giving it five stars (which it deserves) there were three things that I thought should be noted. 1) This place is expensive, but it is worth it. For two people the bill will definitely be over $300 when it's all said and done.  2) 20% gratuity is added on the bill. And it's added for everything, alcohol and tax. I don't necessarily mind the alcohol so much because they do have a wine director that did quite a bit of work and I'm assuming he is part of the tip share, but tipping on the tax shouldn't be required. That said it doesn't bother me enough to not go back. 3) The only part of service that missed the mark for me was that we were not offered coffee or some sort of dessert beverage. I thought that maybe they didn't have a coffee maker and that's why we weren't offered but when we were leaving I did see a coffee pot in the kitchen. Not too big of a deal as it would have added more money to the bill, but just a note.  Overall I loved this place and I will definitely be back for a special dinner!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to the McNinch House for a birthday dinner.  We chose based on the numerous online reviews stating that the McNinch restaurant is perfect for a romantic and quiet evening and we were very much looking forward to our visit.   Upon arrival, we were very impressed with the ambiance, level of service and of course, the food.  Unfortunately, about 45 minutes into our experience, a large party of 10 was seated in the same room.  The volume and overall boisterous demeanor of the large party killed the mood we were had been enjoying previous to their arrival and therefor dampened the evening.  At times we could barely hear ourselves think, let alone hear each other.  While the staff did acknowledge the disturbance, nothing was done to either remedy the situation by moving and/or quieting the large party.  Our coffees were taken off of our bill but that is very insignificant thanks for the $4 dollar coffees off of a very expensive bill.     Going forward, perhaps it would be better for the comfort of all involved to have a separate room designated for large parties only.  It seems like your restaurant makes every effort with the level of service and food so it is a shame to have that effort go to waste due to unfortunate seating placement.    Also i noticed when i parked in my garage that the hood of my car was open, which means the valet much have hit the wrong button when pulling my car up and thankfully it didnt come open during the trip home."}
{"text":"Average at best. Went there for the experience and got out with a bill of over $1200.00 ( for two ) and a case of disappointment ( acute). People ( restaurants) do not understand that fine dinning is not just expensive food. Fine dinning is a \" standard \" that everyone in the place ( especially the owner and chef) should keep. It does not matter where in the world the place may be at from the beginning to the end of the meal the customer ought to feel like royalty ( every customer). Maybe I am spoiled after been to Bouley restaurant and Daniel restaurant the two in New York City But when it's called fine dinning It should be so ,from the  clothing of the employees ( those suits where old and tired and not the right size) to the delicious food ( it was good) and please if nothing else don't use the sommelier as a server assistant ( he can help but not be order around like he had nothing else to do) part of being the sommelier is to talk to the customers about wine. Most of our bill was the wine. Finally , no one, nobody, nowhere, never should add the tip on the check automatically that is taking from the customer the ability to protest in the moment. Could have being very good BUT it was not. Thank you. Javier."}
