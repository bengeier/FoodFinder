{"text":"I believe the only reason this restaurant is still open is the fact for the location.  Its in close proximity to Union Station, the ACC and Financial District which makes it seem like a great place to grab an after work drink and catch a bit of the game.  Unfortunately this is where the good review ends.  It took the hostess 5 mins to come and seat us, the place was 3/4 empty so I am not to sure why it took her so long in the dining area (watching her it looked like she was more interested in socializing with her other servers then doing her job). The server we had was as about as friendly as you can expect from someone who dislikes their job, we indicated we were waiting for another person in our group, she arrived shortly there after but it took another 30 mins before our orders were actually taken.  I had the double double grill cheese with Avocado.  Taste wise it was good, however presentation was sloppy. As well the description of the food and what was served was misleading.    Lastly, for a bar that boasts itself for being a sports bar I had to ask the server to turn cp24 off and turn the hockey game on.  Her response was \"oh, okay, I guess I can\". If they are an establishment that uses sports as there centre point for marketing then a) show sports on the tv and b) have bigger tvs so its not impossible to watch the game.  All in all I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is from Toronto and is very familiar with the other restaurants and bars in the downtown core. To a Toronto visitor it would be great because of the location and the food is sub-par and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The classic burger was quite good although I personally would have enjoyed a smaller bun. Excellent asian beef soup, beet salad was great and sliders were as good as the burger. Place is noisy with suits yapping loudly anoutht their business. Service was ok could use for some more attentive serving staff. Lunch for two (no booze) with an appetizer was a bit rich. Just under one hundred with tip."}
{"text":"Went after a blue jay game.  Sat at the bar.  Girls were doing a shot of Jack Daniels twice.  You can tell that they were drunk. Not the best of service.  Food was great had the wings and fish tacos."}
{"text":"Guinness was sold out when we got here,  no cider on tap. Service was great,  friendly and came by often.  Ordered a steak and it was very thin.  Cooked to medium rare but paper thin.   Overall,  for down town Toronto,  you can do a lot better for this price."}
{"text":"3/5! Good place to go with a large group of coworkers for lunch in the financial district! I recommend the bottom line Cobb salad. The sandwiches are large so can easily be shared."}
{"text":"While food & service was good, the noise level was unbelievable. The reason being that it was a \"game\" night. So unless you are in the mood for a pre-game scrum, I would suggest you keep your visit to another time."}
{"text":"I will stop by for a drink here if I'm meeting my partner after work and sit at the bar. Nothing special. Order drink. Get drink. Pay for drink. No interaction with bartender. It's ok though, service is always fast. Never tried the food. Never even looked at the menu. 3 stars because for my need, this place was just ok."}
{"text":"Great sport venue. Wayne the owner is on premises everyday and all staff are trained in customer service relations.  They can handle larger parties and treat all patrons like they are regulars.  I highly re√ßcomend this spot."}
{"text":"Your average bar and food destination.  Good service, but not too different (food and drink wise) from other places."}
{"text":"The good: location and service. A greeter, our waitress - all very nice. They make you feel welcome and the vibe is very friendly.  The bad: food. We had a burger and a curry. Both plain, tasteless and expensive.   Definitely won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Hunting for an after work spot (the Keg was too busy) ,we ended up at the Bottom Line.  The first thing I noticed is how overly bright the lights were. We're all tired... we really don't need to see each other that well... Please dim the lights, for the sake of your overworked and aging patrons.  And if you happen to be there right before a sporting event at the ACC, the bar has entertainment!. ..in the form of loud yelling men in jerseys and body paint.  As for the food, not bad. The Southwestern salad was tasty!  A healthy option, spinach salad lightly dressed, topped with chicken and crispy noodles.  We ordered a dessert to share... a sundae..... for 8 dollars??? ...."}
{"text":"Enjoy watching a hockey game during lunch? Me neither.   During my stay at the Fairmont Royal York, finding a place to eat has always been a great pain because I am not accustomed to eating in the financial district. My Grandfather on my Mother's side was a yuppie and he passed down many discerning characteristics onto me, but he was a businessman who frequented Europe, so Toronto's yuppie culinary offerings would probably cause unimaginable offence.  Come to think of it, our taste in Women and food are quite alike. He always enjoyed his food made with great delicacy and passion, and he married the Art Deco styled Surgeon General of our hometown.   It was a scorching hot day, and I was in an all seasons suit. I didn't want to move my car from the scarce valet spots in front of the Royal York, so walking a long distance was out. I could have been called for a tasking at any given time, so taking the TTC to Yorkville was out. I really wanted to go to Azure at the Intercontinental City Centre, but I was alone...dammit I'll just walk Eastward!  The Bottom Line? Well, the bottom line was that I was hot, and on call..so The Bottom Line it is! Upon entrance I was horrified, this was a sport bar! Oh NO!  Table for one, the Maitre'D walked me deeper into the restaurant, where it began to look more like a restaurant. Slightly relieved.  Linens, good. Serviettes, good. Relaxing now. I was the only patron at the dining area, with a few sports fans by the bar glued to the television screens placed randomly throughout the front of house. The place doesn't look bad, maybe it's just having a slow day. I looked at the time, and figured I'd get something simple. Calamari with the fish n' chips. Took fifteen minutes for my food to arrive, tolerable but for an empty floor? I wanted a cool refreshing beer, but that was against regulations. I ordered a Sprite, but once again I was given the \"Is 7UP okay?\" One day, just once when a waitress says that to me, I would like to respond with a \"NO!\" \"BITCH!\" Then flip the table and walk out. I saw that in an episode of Robot Chicken, and have been tempted ever since. Can you imagine?   The batter was salty, and the chips were dry. The crisp calamari was good though. Light, not too greasy, but would have been better if more spice was used. I would expect dishes that made more of a bold statement here, considering the name of the restaurant.  I can't say I enjoyed the ambience, but it wasn't insufferable, despite the sports fans. The service was polite, I think my waitress was Italian. Why did I mention this? Why do you think?   My lunch took exactly one hour. It was beginning to look like the rest of my day should clear up, but I didn't want to risk it. There was a mini-bar back at the hotel anyway. This place had high ceilings I kept saying to myself. I wish there was someone else at the dining area for me to look at. The longer I sat here by myself, the more I thought about how odd the idea of restaurants are. Think about it; Eat, sleep, shit. Three of the most primal and private actions performed by Human Beings, Only eating we do in public. We go to a public venue, and put food inside of our bodies in the company of other people doing the same thing. I don't go outside and poop, and sleeping in hotels is really just in a manner of speaking paying for a sense of privacy. Sleep, poop, that's embarrassing. There is no shame in eating in public. How odd..... I was bored.   Maybe there's a sports reference that I am missing, but The Bottom Line is--the name of this place doesn't make any sense to me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and layout. Service was nonexistent. We had to wait 30 minutes for our server to bring the check."}
{"text":"The beer was cold-ish, the food was tasty...that's about it. 2 stars you ask? Service, the service was horrible. It took then 20 minutes to bring out our drinks, and my party of 8 ordered 6 beers and 2 drinks on the rocks...so not a complicated order. Then the food.  The food took 40 minutes. It all came out at separate times too and they brought my sister the wrong sandwich, and blatantly told us so...ok? Go get her the right sandwich? Nope, they'd need another 15 minutes. Ill mention that the place was over half empty! At this point we were going to be late for our show. So we hussled eating and left. The server clearly didn't care and we were forced to pay the gratuity because our group was 8 people. Did I mention that 2 of them didn't even order food? That's right, they got beer. The Bottom Line....is don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Just no reason to make the Bottom Line a destination. Simply average in every way.   The beer menu includes about 6-8 beers - all boring big name beers like Canadian, Bud, Coors light and Rolling Rock. Given the huge trend to craft beer - why not carry at least one option? Or even a decent international brew other than Guinness?  I had the club sandwich. It wasn't bad but nothing wow'd me. My friend had the burger and came to the same conclusion. On the plus side,food prices were good.  No thanks... many better options in the area.  BK"}
{"text":"On the way to a concert at the ACC we were happy to wander upon this place in a rather \"dead\" zone by Union station. I knew it would probably be more expensive than a local neighborhood spot offering similar fare based on the location, but I had fairly high hopes for the food as it bills itself as a \"classy sports bar\" and is located near the Fairmont Royal York.  Disclaimer: definitions of \"classy\" may vary.   The service was good: we were pleasantly greeted at the door, seated right away, and our waitress was prompt, polite and accommodating.   The food was merely okay. I would not define it as a \"gastropub\" based on the menu.   We started with an order of chicken wings (6 wings, two celery sticks, two carrot sticks) which were quite meaty, but eating them was rather awkward as we weren't provided with our own plates nor a dish for the bones: just the shared serving platter they came. Plus on and we only had the linen napkins the cut,ery came rolled in to try and mop up the sauce and blue cheese dressing that dripped onto the table (because no plates) and ourselves. I pity the staff member tasked with laundering all the hot sauce out of those napkins. I understand the place is trying for an upscale feel but when serving a relatively messy, finger-food, pragmatism wins in my book. Wetnaps and paper towels may not be \"classy\" but neither is chicken grease and sauce all over one's chin and fingers.   My husband got the burger and fries which were pretty basic but good, plus a great local microbew from the bar's nice draft selection.   I opted for the roast beef dip with salad. The sandwich itself was decent but the dip accompanying it was not \"au jus,\" it was incredibly salty gravy and had that telltale  \"powdered mix\" taste - I didn't finish it, since I didn't want to be transformed into a desiccated mummy. I just had tap water to drink. Lots of it. Literally four entire glasses. (Did I mention salty dip?) The salad meanwhile was a standard mixed mesclun blend with some grape tomatoes, shredded carrots and cucumber in a light vinaigrette - I mean, it was fine, it was fresh, it was a quality side salad, it tasted perfectly all right: but I wouldn't describe it as \"classy\" unless I was writing this review in 1993.   As for the place itself? It's very clean. It's quite new. It's a large space with ample, comfortable seating. I personally didn't really dig its overall ambience since I don't consider charcoal grey exactly a \"lively\" colour.  Sure there are big-screen TVs and music playing, a large bar, games tables and comfy booths but the acoustics were such that I couldn't really hear the music, television nor even my husband sitting directly across from me - just loud echos of other people talking and clanking cutlery at far-away tables. It just was too cavern-like for my taste.  Sports bars are supposed to be fun, but the environment at this place seemed a little oppressive and dull to me. Also the bases of the booths appeared to be unpainted particle board. I don't know what other people consider \"classy\" but unfinished wood chips ala a semi-renovated basement rec-room isn't my idea of upscale decor.   The two Ladies' bathrooms were also a little weird. They both were nice and clean, but the lower one was so small that upon entering, I bumped a woman washing her hands with the door, and when I was using the sink someone else coming in hit me with the door. It didn't have a mirror which was rather annoying.  The larger restroom up near the bar did have a mirror, however it was playing some sort of flash ads across it, so my reflection was obscured by animated spots plugging paper towels and budget vacations which was even more annoying. While many bars do have advertisements located intrusively in their bathrooms, it is certainly not classy: it's the epitome of tacky. Having those advertisements aggressively covering one's face when one is trying to use the mirror is downright crass.   The verdict: six wings, a burger and fries, a beef sandwich and salad plus one pint came to nearly 70 dollars with tax. Pretty steep given the meal itself, but certainly not atypical for the \"tourist trap\" element on that section of Front Street.  I am not including the $$ we got stuck shelling out 30 minutes later at the ACC for overpriced, bottled water, even though I suspect my meal was probably the cause of my intense thirst. (Did I mention the meat-infused, concentrated, reduction of possibly the Dead Sea itself served as a dip? )   If you're stuck downtown and looking for a spacious spot to meet up with people that has a decent drink selection, or want to grab a casual (albiet overpriced) sit-down dinner before a game, concert or train trip this is a reasonable enough option. But I wouldn't recommend a special visit here if you are anywhere near another sports bar or pub. Rectangular plates and linen napkins are not enough to designate something as a \"classy\" establishment."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite before a concert. Food was good, server was pleasant and helpful. Was quite loud, but good."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews that attribute the success of this place to its proximity to the downtown core and the expense accounts that come with it.  I enjoyed a modestly sized \"large\" Cobb salad. Fresh, tasty, and covered by a corporate credit card."}
{"text":"A convenient location close to Union is the best thing about this place, staff and service was good too come to think of it, however something just didn't click between The Bottom Line and myself. I get mixed signals about the kind of place this is, I like the spacious interior but then upon spending time in here that same interior and bright lights seem contradictory to what this place wants to be. And what I mean by that is that it feels like The Bottom Line plays pretend to being a cozy pub type atmosphere with games scattered in random disjointed locations, but ends up being lost somewhere in between a Milestones type place and a small intimate pub.   My general feeling of not loving this place wasn't aided by the pretty loud and annoying crowd that seemed to be in here. You'd think that post game Jays fans would be loud and drunk, but it seemed to be the non-baseball crowd that was loud and seemed to think the venue was theirs to venture about in. This of course goes back to my earlier point of the random spots the pub decided to place bar games, we had drunk people wandering around being loud.   We split a three cheese pizza, which was good so gotta hand it to them for that, realistically I could see myself coming back here because it is so convenient to a commuter like me to have a place for decently priced (they have drink specials) drinks before taking the bus/train back in to the burbs from Union.   The Bottom Line: Of course I could have come at a pretty unfortunate night, and it could be a nice quiet spot for  a drink on most nights."}
{"text":"The BL is a great place to grab a quick drink after work  and mingle with the Bay St. locals. Now that they've expanded the place it's less intimate and more jack astors like. The servers are friendly and there are daily drink specials.  Avoid the nachos, overpriced and small portion for the $18 they charge."}
{"text":"Beer was spilled all over me, my phone, the table. The incompetent waitress starts laughing. Really? The place was a ghost town so no issue with trying to manage multiple tables. Asked the owner, apparently a former hockey player, who would be replacing my phone if the beer damaged it. He says, arrogantly... be nice, accidents happen.   He should stick to hockey. Uncool!"}
{"text":"Me and some friends stopped in here today while we were looking for a quick place to find a drink near Union.   We walked in to this place and thought it would be a smaller pub style place.  The decor was really great, I totally felt under dressed there in just a pair of shorts and a v neck.   The menu wasn't too big, but it looked pretty varied.  The server told us the specials, and we just each had a pint of sommersby.  It was a cute place, and I definitely want to try it again when we have more time :)  3 stars for now!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great, the service is great, it can't get much better than this! Highly recommend coming here before any game or concert!"}
{"text":"Went to the bottom line after work on a Friday night with some work friends. When we got there, half of the place was not opened, and the half thay was wasn't particularly full. The service was pretty slow... It took a while before the waitress came to take our order, and after we did she came back about 10 minutes later asking for our order again, I'm guessing cause she forgot. We got our drinks another while later and it felt as though we were completely forgotten. Nobody came by to check on us to see if we wanted another round or anything. We had to go find our waitress to order for another round. That again took a super long time before the drinks came.  Finally, time for the bill, we asked for the bill and about 10 minutes later she came back to ask what we ordered, again...  Maybe she was new on the job, maybe it was just a bad night but I was not impressed by the service.  The drinks themselves were decent, I could probably get better somewhere else."}
{"text":"Really underwhelming and overpriced for what you get. Have to pay for pop refills even though they're half ice. Chicken sandwich is $16 and has a tiny piece of chicken in it (told the server and she said \"yeah, it's always like that\"). Finally, the bathroom stall was dirty - never a good sign. Lots of choices in this area and you can definitely do better for the price."}
{"text":"Stopped in with some friends for the game. Ordered the crispy calamari. What a disappointment. Chewy, stretchy and rubbery.  Must have been frozen. Ordered the naked famous wings with the suicide sauce to replace them. Wings were ok but smaller than what I normally have in other places. The suicide sauce was anything but."}
{"text":"My time working in financial services has pretty much grounded into me that I'm not a \"suit\".  I don't have many as friends or acquaintances, and at parties, I pretty much try to stay apart from anyone wearing pinstripes, discussing the finer points of their golf game and NASDAQ or whatever the hell that is.  At the Bottom Line, in and amongst a small sprinkling of the regular folk, you'll find a ton of suits discussing just that.  This place is banking (no pun intended) on the fact that they will cater to the financial services and business community that surrounds this pub.  The beer prices and menu reflect the fact that many can afford or have expense accounts that will accommodate their post work needs.  There's TVs showing sports, Leafs paraphernalia adorning the walls, and all in all, the only thing that makes this stand out from any other bar is that you can hear \"Leafs power-play\" and \"hedge fund\" used in the same conversation.  Oh, and in case you haven't got a pair of Leafs tickets, the Bottom Line will raffle off a pair just before the puck drops.  This will allow you to go to the ACC (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/air-canada-centre-toronto), ignore the game, and discuss business further, ensuring that another pair of seats is denied from the hands of true fans."}
{"text":"A centrally located upscale pub with plenty of suits during off-work hours. Came by on a Wednesday after work to find plenty of empty tables but all of them were reserved for that night's game.That was frustrating to hear but an understandable practice on a games night. I was directed to the bar which was first-come-first serve and was able to elbow my way to a seat.   Once at the bar, they took my credit card to start a tab. I ordered a beer and their clubhouse ($15). The sandwich was a simple one: grilled chicken, bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo on a bun. The meal was nothing special but something about it gave me a stomach ache afterwards. During my meal, the man beside me complained to the waitress that the wings app (also $15) only came with 6 pieces and that the portion was too small.  So at the end of the night, I can only advise to avoid coming here on games night unless you've reserved a table, skip the clubhouse and don't choose the wings as a main meal. You are on your own to discover if there are any good recommendations."}
{"text":"I loved the Bottom Line! My sister and I were here for some sight seeing. We stumbled by and decided to check it out. It's a nice place and the food is phenomenal! The wings were amazing! I saw that they were ranked top 2 in all of Toronto and they definitely played the part. They were huge, meaty (not like some places that give you tiny wings) and the sauce was perfect. The blue cheese was good too, just high quality food.   They had a wide variety of food to choose from burgers and wings to Chicken Alfredo. It wasn't just average bar food, you could tell they make a direct effort to spice things up and make it unique. I had the Chicken Alfredo, it came with diced tomatoes and mushrooms and it didn't feel like it came from a bar. It was unreal! My sister had the Grilled Cheese with Bacon and tomato with salad on the side. She loved it. They used really good greens that were very fresh and the grilled cheese was awesome. Whenever I make a grilled cheese at home I'm going to use bacon and tomato in it hahaha.   Service was great! We sat at the bar and Roxy took care of us and she was awesome, no complaints at all. She was attentive, quick but also talked to us and made us feel at home.   Overall great joint in the heart of Toronto. Next time Either one of us are here we are definitely going to come back. No doubt in my mind you should check it out. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Dropped by after the Leafs vs. Wild game March 3rd around 10ish. Bar was full.  Half the high tops had people at them.  One table of two in the other room.  Not busy enough to warrant terrible food and service. Two bartenders serving with one support staff running food.   Still took 7 minutes for anyone to take the order.  With impatience and eye rolling.  My favourite kind of service.  Asked for an appetizer recommendation - bartender suggested calamari.  The calamari arrived hot and the guy who ran the food was really friendly but nothing else about it was good.  Uniform (clearly frozen from a bag) rings over-fried which turned soggy after 2 minutes.  Served with lime instead of lemon which was weird.  Dip was basically mayo.  Ate a few and left the rest.  Bartender eventually did a table check and we politely expressed that the calamari was terrible.  She seemed to acknowledge what was wrong with the app but left it on the bill ($15.82) with no further apologies.  Avoid this place.  Way better food and service a little farther along Front (C'est What, etc.)"}
{"text":"I dropped by once before they expanded the place. At that time you could say that it was a cozy, intimate bar with a bit of charm. The atmosphere was neat. You kind of ended up with two different crowds: the after-work Bay street crowd, and then the hockey/sports fan who just ended up here for whatever reason.   Now that it's expanded, it's lost its charm. Somehow the place feels dated, in a soulless way. It comes off more like a generic sports bar, serving uninspired pub food, without all the bells and whistles of any more \"real\" or more modern sports bar. The service is still pretty good and the food, although uninteresting, is decent. At the end of the day though, take your pick between a pub, sports bar, or steakhouse, and there's guaranteed to be a better option within a 15-minute walk from here."}
{"text":"I was totally fine with this place. We just wanted a beer and a quick bite to eat, and this fit the bill. Food was solid and the service was fast. We were in-and-out in just over 30 minutes, which is what we were hoping for.   I can understand the experiences of some other reviewers, but it seems like a lot of people complaining that the patrons of a bar are drunk. This place is a cross between a pub and a sports bar. It makes no claims of fine-dining or an alcohol-free experience. If you want to watch a sporting event without any people around you drinking, stay at home."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on a Sunday and I'd describe the food as average .... the menu has options for most, the portions are OK and the food is tasty. Of the fish & chips, Cajun chicken sandwich and burger I think the burger was the winner that day. Sweet potato fries looked amazing. It was very quiet when we were here. It's a casual eatery, they've almost double their size I think - used to be much smaller."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always feel at home here. The food is good, the service is great. And Wayne the owner is always here to share a beer and a story from his NHL days. Lots of beers on tap, good menu selection and always the best games on the hundred tvs."}
{"text":"I cannot say I'm a fan of this place...  Wandered in post Jays game for a pint. They were somewhat busy, but we had no trouble finding a seat.   Immediately I got a weird vibe about the crowd, lots of very drunk, or maybe just VERY loud people. The laugh so loud everyone looks at them kind.   Secondly, the service was unfortunately basically crap. It was slow, we couldn't get a glass of water to save our lives, and our server was basically non existent.   Thirdly, there was an advertised mojito special and they were out of mint. Seriously?! Take down the sign then!!   Overall this was just not a great place and with so much competition in the area, don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Drop by at the Bottom Line for some drinks with some friends.  It's right beside the Hockey Hall of Fame and very close to Union Station and Go Trains so the location is great.  When I walked in the place is huge but it was completely empty accept where my friends were at the bar area. I think we were the only ones in that place.  Mind you it's also on a Monday evening and no sports game was on so I can see why it's dead at the place.  It's a cross between a pub and a sports bar with a lot of TVs around.  I can see this being a cool spot for game night. I ordered a platter of nachos with chicken and my drinks of the evening was vodka water. Drinks were ok however the nachos were stale.  The chicken that came with it was tiny and dry.  That was the only item I ordered off the menu and it was not that great so I decided not to order any entree and to go somewhere else for food after.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time as part of a business lunch. Had the spicy sausage penne recommended and I thought I would like it. I usually don't like tomato sauce pasta but I do like spicy Italian sausage. I feel like I could make this at home.... I wasn't wow'd at all. Although it wasn't terrible, for $17 I expected more.   The service was also spotty, my glass of water was empty for the longest time.   The good thing is that they have TONS of TVs... So I imagine it would be a great place to catch a game. During lunch hour, they were all playing CP24, but that might've just been because there was nothing else to watch."}
