{"text":"Good Korean Food.  Small restaurant, and located in the industry area.  Good price and value.  You order main dishes, and self served rice, water and tea (as much as you want).  Authentic korean food.  Love  it."}
{"text":"Love how authentic this restaurant is. 
We didn't have to wait too long to be seated despite the place being packed.
While the prices at first seem a little expensive for a \"hole in the wall\" the serving sizes are super generous. My bf and I shared a spicy chicken bulgogi, a fish cake soup and a seafood pancake.
The fish cake soup was a bit bland but the pancake and spicy/sweet bulgogi more than made up for it.
It was great reading others reviews beforehand to find out about the self serve rice and water. 
It's not obvious that's how it works. 
We took part of our meal home because with your meal came the assortment of apps like kimchi, dried fish, and so on. They were refilled once we had finished them.
I could have made a meal out of the apps alone.
While it does say they offer some drinks of the booze variety, when my bf tried ordering a beer, he was told they currently weren't serving any liquor.
Just a heads up for those expecting more than tea or water during their meal.
Will  go back to try some of the shared meals they offer on the menu."}
{"text":"Tiny little place with amazing food!!! Couldn't be anymore authentic then hopping a plane. The service was excellent. The food was outstanding. Weren't sure what to order and our waitress was great in helping us choose some fantastic dishes. 
A real hidden gem and reasonably priced. Can't wait to go back. Loved it!"}
{"text":"I ordered bulgogi here, expecting the usual good quality.  Unfortunately,  the meat they served was almost rancid and completely unfit for serving.  Certain mistakes may happen from time to time but something like this is completely inexcusable."}
{"text":"Delicious !!! Spicy meat lover stew was the bomb !!! Lots of meat lots of veg lots of side dishes :) prep ur belly before u go to this place :) unlimited tea /water  and rice !"}
{"text":"Great Korean food!!
Genuinely nice and friendly staff with unlimited side dishes and rice, 
delicious~ delicious~!
What can you ask for more??!!!
Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Korean restaurants in Calgary! The food is always so tasty and I love all the starters they bring out at the beginning. You get unlimited rice, water and tea as well. My favorites are the rice cakes, kimchi soup and the octopus hot pot."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever! Food took more than 45 minutes to come and they keep the side door open on a very windy day. The garbage bin literally fell down by my feet. The server told us that one of our dishes is not available and ask us to order something else and then we have been left all by ourselves since. There's many Korean restaurants out there, don't come if you expect at least an average service!!"}
{"text":"Was in town for the Stampede and left the rodeo craving some good Korean food. Thanks to Yelp, help wasn't far away!

The inside of the restaurant is nice and cozy, around 4-5 tables depending on how they arrange them. The small size helps when you're competing with the other tables to get your unlimited rice refills ;).

For two people, we ordered the LA Kalbi and pork kimchi jigae. The kalbi was nicely marinated and tender, and the pork kimchi jigae was some of the best I've had! On top of that, banchan had great variety, including some that you don't often see. Highly recommend getting seconds of the fishcake and rice cake; it was great! One minor quibble is that the menu is lacking is some appetizers in the $6-12 range. Pretty much everything on the menu is a main course. Other than that, Han Corea is a \"hole in the wall\" gem!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there, Kim chi soup was amazing. My place is in Fullerton 30 minutes away from Los Angeles, many top Korean restaurant in the area but still ham Korea had better taste. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Han Corea is one of my fav. spot for korean food. They offer a lot of options but be careful portions are really large! good for group of 4, perfect for sharing!! Got the meat stew, perfect for a cold winter day."}
{"text":"Legit! Does not feel like you are sitting in a South Calgary industrial park. If you like Korean grub this is worth checking out for sure."}
{"text":"Busy place when I visited on Sunday during lunch hour. Authentic Korean food, all customers are Asian, Korean mostly. Great food, great free appetizers. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! A must-try if you love Korean food. Just make sure to make a reservation as places fill up quickly!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the look out for a new Korean restaurant to try out. Upon Yelping Korean food, Han Corea popped up. It's in sort of an industrial part of southeast Calgary. The place itself isn't anything fancy, more like a hole in the wall diner feeling. The restaurant itself holds maybe 40 or so people.
I had ordered the beef bulgogi, and the seafood pancake. The beef bulgogi is served on a hotplate and comes with beef, glass noodles, onion, and carrots. It actually is similar in taste to Japanese sukiyaki. Nonetheless it was very tasty. The seafood pancake, is made up of flour, green onions and squid. It's served with a soy based sauce also tasty.
The rice and water are free as well as the side dishes that accompany your entree. The free rice is located by the entrance on a table which is a blend of both white and black rice giving it a coloring which is almost redish/purple. 
your food comes with more than your typical Korean side dishes ie: bean sprouts, kimchee, and daikon. They have 6 side dishes in all and one of them being a root based vegetable, and another with fish cakes.
Our server, I believe her name was Nae was very helpful in explaining the side dishes. I would like to add that she was attentive and willing to explain the dishes that were on the menu.

I will be back for sure in the future."}
{"text":"With all the hype here we decided to go tonight after my kid's Winter Concert, it was packed and we have to wait for about 20-25 minutes to grab a seat. The waitress ushered us nice and warm, and so With the  review saying the bulgogi stew and seafood pancake were great so I ordered it after much thought. The side dishes came first, and I must say it's the most variety I've seen so far out of the restos we've been through. It has kimchi , pickled radish, sausages, saut√©ed mushrooms, seaweed salad and lettuce . Pancake seafood cake next, it's thick , and not the thinner version I've been used to, it had too much flour and less seafood than I thought, more onions making it dry and not as tasty. The sauce isn't to the taste I've been expecting , seems diluted so as not to be spicy. Beef bulgogi stew came and was cooked a little later, serves 2-3 but I think it's For 4-5 people, nevertheless, they tried to make it quick. There's enoki mushrooms, tofu, beef, glass noodles and some fish on it. A little sweet broth with a hint of pepper. Altho I personally love the pork stew, this is a different twist altogether. It would have been great if not for the seafood pancake, but with the service and effort, plus the awesome side dishes, thus the 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is place serves authentic Korean Food just like in Korea. 
The spicy squid and pork was so awesome, bursting with the right spice melts together perfectly with squid and the pork. 
The rice cake took us all by surprise as the vegetables and fish cake just compliments the rice cake so well together we all went back for more than what we should of had. 
The free side dishes were very well done quite a variety that you don't get at most other places it was very good. 
The kimchi soup was typical but still good, we should have ordered the seafood soup I believe that would have been more flavorful. 
The other dish was ordered by my other family member but you have to like intestines and blood sausage like type of sausage. It was good but not something I would run for. Everyone else love it. So majority rulesup.
Their self serve rice was really good as well.
Over all this Resturant really took me by surprise as it looked like the little restaurants in Korea the taste is even the same. 
The real down side to this restaurant is its too small they turned away many customers as this place got full so fast. 
We for sure be back for more. 
I really want to thank everyone that gave honest review to this place this is reason I got to try this place. You guys wrote some awesome reviews. Thanks to all Yelpers you guys are really great keep the reviews coming!"}
{"text":"hot and spicy is most of the dishes. The portion is rather large, be sure not to order to much. I got stir fired bacon, stir fried port feet( spicy), and a meat lover pot. Too much for 3 people I would say. Dinner time has a lot of customers.  Make sure to come early"}
{"text":"Tasty bulgogi! 
I also tried the seafood pancake but it was disappointing. It's very thick and soggy, I prefer Korean pancakes to be thin and crispy like what other korean restaraunts offer."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend who already stuffed himself with food before he picked me up after my work. I specifically told the server I was the only one eating when the server sat us down. However, when I ordered only one dish, she told me each person has to order 1 dish and that was their last exception. I had come here before and know their food was good but that was just rude to tell your customer how many dishes they have to have, especially when I told you from the beginning the other person is not eating (and I mean he didn't even touch their cutlery). I have been to countless restaurants in my life and countless time where I or the other person was there for the company only and not the food; yet this is the first that gave me such attitude. That was the most awkward meal I have ever had in my life and we'll never ever come back to such a money hungry business."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible do not even bother you will end up with bad service and in a industrial area with overpriced average food served by people who are full of themselves. Sorry but let me remind you customers make you money treat them well. Second of all you are just a server I am a business owner and I would fire employee's for lack of care."}
{"text":"I like this Korean restaurant so much. It is a family restaurant restaurant I think. Very tradition Korean cuisine. The side dishes are different every time and so delicious. And you ask for refill of the side dishes any times you want. Rice and water are also free. I highly recommend their pork feet and pork bone soup. The sizes are super large, so I suggest you come with your friends. It opens until 1am at midnight too. I give it 4 star only because it's location is kinda far away and inconvenient for people who don't drive.  Overall a great restaurant. No.1 Korean restaurant in Calgary."}
{"text":"This is the fourth Korean restaurant I have tried in Calgary now and it is the best. Service was great, food was fresh! If you like Korean food or think you could try it this place is an absolute must."}
{"text":"Delicious Korean food! A total hole in the wall and quite frankly we thought that our Google Maps had failed us when we arrived outside because you would never think that there would be a restaurant in that area but there sure is!

It's quite a small restaurant so be prepared to wait a little bit if you're going during peak dining hours. They have self-serve tea and rice which I can only assume is to help the fact that they're completely understaffed. 

We ordered the spicy squid and pork and it was amazing. The pork was thinly sliced and had a very nice texture. And all of the mini dishes were amazing as well. Between my hubby and I that was more than enough food and we're both fairly big eaters. 

The only reason that I docked it one star was the service. As I mentioned above, it's completely understaffed and when we walked into the restaurant at around 9PM, although the restaurant was half empty, the emptied tables had yet to be waited and we couldn't be seated for another 5 minutes. It was also really hard to find someone to help you since it seems like their servers spend most of the time in the kitchen. 

Overall, the food was great but if you're coming here, don't expect to be in and out quickly. Would definitely come back if we're ever in Calgary again."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. As a Korean myself this is the best korean food in town. If you are looking for authentic dishes, this is a must visit."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty hole in the wall.  Food is homey comfort food.  Had the bulgogi  beef and chicken and the spicy pork and squid.   All were very flavourful.  
We had takeout but didn't get any Kim chi appetizers which was a bit disappointing.  Other than that, no complaints.   Will be looking forward to trying some of the other traditional Korean dishes some of which even look a bit exotic even for my Asian tastes.  Spicy pig tripe?  Who knew."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my boyfriend on Friday night it was soooo packed. Make reservations!!!!! They don't speak good English here but they were super friendly. Food was so good. We had the spicy squid and pork....yummy. Portions are really big and its self serve all you can eat red bean rice. Will come back again but with a big group so we can try more items."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom on a Monday for lunch. Portions are huge! Unlimited rice was a nice touch because they give you so much meat. We can't handle much spice but the girl attending to us gave some amazing recommendations. I'd love to come back here with more of my family in tow to help us tackle the meal"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Not too sure what the rave is all about. My boyfriend and I arrived for dinner on a Saturday around 7:00 p.m. 

We waited about 15 minutes for a table, were seated and given menus. I proceeded to get water for my boyfriend and I and then returned to my seat to look through the menu. 

A few minutes later the waitress told us we had to change our seats because of another party and re-seated us accordingly. We continued to look at the menu and upon reading reviews on Yelp, we ordered the bulgogi and the spicy pork with squid dishes.

Our food arrived in a timely manner but we noticed that there was no pork in our dish. We were quite hungry so didn't say anything. When we went up to get rice the cooker was empty and there was no rice. The waitress explained that it would take about 7 more minutes for the rice to be ready.

Not even 3 minutes later the rice was 'ready' and put into the rice cooker to be served. There was a line up in the rice cooker/water/tea serving area and I noticed some people looked at the rice and walked away. When it was my turn, I realized that the rice was very watery and under cooked.

I took some rice and went back to my seat. The waitress then came by and took away our spicy pork dish and explained that it had been meant for the table next to us. She only realized this because the next door table told her theirs didn't have any pork. So she took our dish away and replaced it promptly with the other table's order.

I was not impressed by the quality or taste of the food, especially for how much it cost. The bulgogi was average at best and the spicy squid and pork dish wasn't anything that I couldn't have made better at home myself."}
{"text":"My daughterand I had been craving for Korean food for a while. Big surprised we found this place.  Definitely will be back again when visiting cow town.  Very friendly family owned restaurant.  Best kimchi soup in town."}
{"text":"We were a bit confused trying to find the restaurant and thought maybe google maps was trolling us, but I'm glad we made it at around 10 pm at night. There was a huge crowd of Korean people inside and it felt rather festive. I simply adore Han Corea- even the fact that you serve yourself as much rice and water as you want. It felt very homely. 

I've also never had so many side dishes brought out on the house at a Korean restaurant. Most of them were delicious except the cold egg-battered zucchini was a little bit weird. There was a dish with Konjac cubes, soy sauce and seaweed which was fun to eat. The cabbage kimchi was also slightly different from what I've had- it had an interesting funky flavour. My favourite was the slightly sweet kimchi pickled daikon though!

We ordered a beef bulgogi and the soup for drinkers which had Korean sausage, intestine, mushroom, bean sprouts and slices of fatty pork. 

The beef bulgogi was fragrant with medley of Asian ingredients, and it was on the sweeter side. My companion said it was the best he'd ever had, but I found it a tad too sweet for a savory dish. The soup for drinkers was also fabulously funky, maybe in part from the offal meats in the soup. There wasn't actually any intestines, it was more like stomach. The casing of the Korean sausages (Sundae) were likely intestines, and I found it too chewy. There were noodles and pork blood inside. Overall, the soup was incredibly flavourful! Han Corea has become my new favourite Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been here few times, the food and service were good. For my visit today, I had to wait for half an hour for rice after they brought my soup dish, so didn't have rice until my soup got cold. The side dish were also brought to us after we started eating. The only staff in the dining area didn't seem to care if there is rice not, you have to have rice for your Korean soup! Very disappointed experience, and will never go back."}
{"text":"I really like this place a lot of excellent sizzling dishes.  if you want some authentic Korean fare. then this is definitely one of the best places to go in Calgary."}
{"text":"It is the best Korean restaurant in calgary! They give out so many types of appetizer for free! Love them all. The portion sizes are pretty big, go with all your friends. Will defines come back, awesome taste!"}
{"text":"2018. 04. 23. I had a lunch with my previous manager nearby the Chinook Center. The name of the restaurant called Han Corea Korean Restaurant, which is a small Korean Restaurant, is hidden in the community in front of Chinook Mall. It's a friendly family based Korean Restaurant, which services surprised and authentic Korean Dishes. Besides that, it¬†offers free self-serve water, tea, and rice, which is a nice! We arrived the restaurant right after 12 pm on the weekday. It was still very busy. But, we were very lucky and found the table fast. We had very amazing experience eating at this restaurant. We only ordered the pork¬†bone Stew with bulgogi, tofu, enoki mushrooms,¬† onion, green onion, rice cakes and cellophane noodles to share. The taste of the soup was great depth and flavour. The bulgogi was very chewy. It was a super large portion, which could serve more than 3 people. The small cold dishes were great too, which were including bean sprouts, marinated egg, daikon and seaweed, soy sauce dipping sauce, mushrooms, salad, kimchi and cold style pancake. They were tasty and authentic. The owner and servers of the restaurant are all Korean. I guess that's why the food at Han Corea Restaurant are authentic and delicious. Highly Recommend people to try out Han Corea Korean Restaurant."}
{"text":"After eating junk foods on the road got us super craving for some Korean food. 

We had NengMyung (cold noodle) and boy was it delicious! You can't get NengMyun this good anywhere including Korea (ok, maybe I exaggerated a bit). The servers were being great too. I would definitely come back if I ever come to Calgary.

Water & Rice is self served but is unlimited and free!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Han Corea is in the middle of nowhere; an industrial hidden gem. It reminds me a lot of Won Jung Gak (in Edmonton) in terms of whereabouts. 

We came on a Friday evening around 7:45pm. The place was packed so we had to put our names down and waited about 15 minutes to snag a spot. The inside is small but charming. Some Korean talk show had all the Koreans inside enthralled. Good to see majority of the people were Korean. 

The hours are exceptional. Open till 1:00am everyday except Sunday (12:00am). Service is pretty solid. There's unlimited water, tea and rice but it's self serve. Just walk up to the counter and help yourself. Wish the water glasses were a bit bigger.

Menu is actually smaller than normal. Lots of items were blocked out. 

- Banchan - really impressed with all the banchan that they brought out. 8 different types total; bean sprouts, marinated egg, daikon and seaweed, soy sauce dipping sauce, mushrooms, salad, kimchi and cold style pancake. 
- Seafood pancake (#18) ($14.95) - green onion, vegetables and squid. Massive for the price! We didn't even finish half. Crispy outside texture and tasty filling. 
- Spicy chicken bulgogi (#12) ($17.95) - chicken slathered in spicy red pepper paste with onions underneath. Wasn't that spicy but chicken was tender and flavourful. 
- Bulgogi stew (#31) ($43.98) - stew with bulgogi, tofu, enoki mushrooms, sliced carrots, onion, green onion, rice cakes and cellophane noodles. To quote L, the broth was unexpectedly delicious. Very peppery and aromatic, great depth and flavour. The bulgogi was very chewy. Different but still good. The menu says it's good for 2-3 people but you can easily share for 4. Delicious.

Solid Korean spot. Would come back for sure. Especially for some late night eats."}
{"text":"Like what most of the other reviews have mentioned, this is a hole in the wall. How you know it's legit authentic Korean food is probably the fact that it's connected to the Korean community center. It's a small restaurant that can seat roughly 20 people. There is a unlimited water and rice station where you can help yourself. Service is prompt; food comes out as quick as you order it. This family owned establishment provides satisfaction guaranteed Korean food. You'll definitely walk out feeling content and big-bellied."}
{"text":"But closer to a five. Solid food. It's just below the Calgary Korean Association. Filled with Korean moms and dads. THIS is comfort food. How can you go wrong??! We got the kimchi jjigae and dwaejibulgogi. Awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is really good.  It is in a far-flung corner of the city in the industrial area surrounded by warehouses.  If you really want to impress friends with your knowledge of local spots, take them here.

This is a complete hole in the wall, but very popular with the local Korean crowd.  It is even open until 1AM on weekdays which is unheard of especially in a quiet area of town like this one.

Seafood pancake was delicious and unlike any others that I have tried in the city. We also ordered the hot pot to share. There were 4 of us and we could barely finish it.  Prices aren't the cheapest, but the food quality is stellar and would come here again.

The service can be a tad slow especially during busy periods, so be forewarned!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's unassuming, unpretentious and just downright delicious. It is the mother of all things coined \"hole in the wall.\" It's a family owned and run joint, and the place before this restaurant was open was probably not a restaurant. Even cooler. Even though the menu has English, no one here actually speaks English so just point. 
Self serve rice and water, utensils are in the box at the end of each table. Get your own drinks from the cooler. They have bek soju, raspberry (I think) soju, and chamisul. Hite is always the beer of choice at Korean joints. 
I've had almost ever dish here, and you have my word when I say NOTHING on the menu is below DELICOUS level. Order the pork and squid bulgogi (spicy) and thank me later. The meat is always quality, and the soup is always piping hot. The older lady will come by and harass you a bit if she sees left over food, but you won't understand her because it's in Korean and she does it with a huge smile so it's all good. But don't break her heart and finish you meal ok?"}
{"text":"This has now become our new favorite place for korean food! It's a bit hidden as its in a warehouse area, but well worth the drive. There's a bit of parking beside the restaurant, but many times the restaurant is full up, so you've gotta park on the street anyways. Make reservations ahead if you don't want to wait for your yummy food! This place is also open super late so it's perfect for those late night dinners.
I love the self serve parts of this restaurant, where you can get your own drinks and rice. The seafood pancake is fairly large and delicious; it could totally be a meal in and of it self. We love to share the tteok-bokki as well!
There is quite a selection of soups available for individual or to share. There are also the best cold noodles i've ever had available in the warmer months! Even their banchans are well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Small restaurant but was able to just walk in on 8 pm and was able to get a seat. I had doubts having tried other korean restaurant at Calgary. But this restaurant had surpassed our expectations.
Lots of delicous side dishes with refills. All good food and authentic , gives generous amounts. Would love to go there again if i visited calgary again"}
{"text":"Authentic. Delicious. 

Off the beaten path but worth it.

Small space is always full, and they also offer takeout."}
{"text":"We made reservation at 630pm, arrived 620 and waited until 715! All the while I was trying to calm down a hungry toddler. The food was ok, but they kept the internal temperature so high and the fact that the inside was really small made us very uncomfortable. not recommended if you have kids and don't bother making reservations cause they don't seem to care and will not honour it anyways."}
{"text":"Visited twice, love this place! very korean! 

Not very big, but can fit big groups of ppl. there's a corner for everyone to get drinks, water and rice (self serve)

Reasonable price, open late, and the food is good."}
{"text":"Definately one of the hidden gems of Calgary, and then some.  Heck, in the 2 visits, my group was literally the only ones eating there.  

Months ago, I visited Han Corea, a little Korean restaurant tucked away in an industrial sector of Fairview inside the Calgary Korean Association building.  What we found surprised us, as it basically was as if we were transported to a street cafe in the middle of some suburb of Seoul, far from the tourist areas.  The cooks, the signs and even the menus were entirely in Korean, with nary an English sign anywhere.  Fortunately back then, a couple dining there took pity on us and helped us to a great inexpensive meal!

I've wanted to return for months, but I didn't know anyone else who could read or speak Korean, and just pointing at the menus struck me as a little bit too haphazard.  But things changed this week as I organized another dinner.  It was a cold night, and nothing like a warm kimchi soup as comfort food.

Thankfully, my Aunt and fellow yelper Eswina N., had a  friend, Nori who was a native speaker and came to join us.  So with Nori's help, myself, my gal, @VincciT of @ciawesome, Yelper/Aunt Eswina N. and Yelper @theaimlesscook enjoyed an incredible meal at Han Corea.

We first started with the kimchi stew and a pork soup.  The stew was just as memorable as the first time.  A perfect balance of heat and spice came together to form a soup that just screams Korea in every sense of the word.  Just enough of a bite to the palate, it was bursting with the flavours of the vinegar, hot spice and the vegetable.  And the pork soup was no slouch other.  While not exactly very seasoned, it came with a great selection of hot and salty sauces that allowed the diner try the soup as they preferred to their taste preferences.

Next came a festival of bulgogi dishes, with a beef bulgogi, LA ribs bulgogi, a squid and pork bulgogi and a pork skin bulgogi served one by one, each as tasty and rich in flavour as the next.  Some were spicy, some were sweet, but all were delicious, as the Korean flavours were bright and strong with each bite.  Add the great complimentary selection of pickled dishes and unlimited white rice, the food just spoke volumes on the culture and the joys of home cooking. 

And just when we thought we were done, the restaurant made an interesting additional dish, a sun dae or Korean vermicelli roll mixed with pork blood and liver complete with a dipping salt.  As odd as that sounds, it was simply yummy in every sense of the word.    

Now how much was such a feast for six people?  $140 you say?  $150?  Nope...  it was $80 after tax.  Yep, that's it.  Dinner for 6 with 7 courses, unlimited rice and pickled side vegetables and tea and coffee (also unlimited) cost us $80.  Even after adding a generous tip, it was still only $16 a person.  Where the heck in Calgary can you have a 7 course dinner, and pay only $16?  

I just love this place, and hope to organize a new group soon!  

Update #6 of Yelp's 30-Day Challenge"}
{"text":"Legit korean food. The rice and water is self serve. We came here twice and ordered the Soondae Soup, Fried Octopus with Ttaekboki, and fried squid. The meals are priced well and comes with a large assortment of banchans that you can ask for refills. I enjoyed the restaurant and the vibes. My Korean wife claims this is the best korean place in Calgary, so that's a fact!

 !"}
{"text":"Han Corea is a small korean eatery that offers all you can eat rice and self serve water/tea/drinks. This is pretty common in Korea, but not in North America so this might confuse customers that are still waiting for their server to ask what they would like to drink. 

The eatery atmosphere is not that great as the decorations and setup of the dinning room is simplistic. The walls are in need of wiping down and overall the eatery needs some sort of revamping. But that is the only low point of Han Corea. 

The food is superb! I have been to Korea multiple times and it's hard to find a korean restaurant in Calgary that serves authentic korean food. We ordered the squid and pork with spicy sauce and it was enough for 3 or 4 people in my opinion. The serving portions are quite large and is great for sharing. You also get side dishe with your order, which is a usual in all Korean restaurants. I am looking forward to try their spicy rice cakes and seafood pancakes.

Overall, I definitely recommend Han Corea, but just be prepared that the location gives a \"hole in the wall\" feeling, and that this does not at all affect the quality of their dishes."}
{"text":"We got takeout from here and for Calgary I have to give this place a solid 4. Part of this is because there are many items you can get there that you will never see in more westernised Korean joints... items with all the innards that most North American folk throw in the bin. The place itself is a hole in the wall and very casual. Service seemed friendly enough, but if you're eating in you should be aware it's the kind of place you get most things yourself... tea, rice, etc.... in other words, self-serve.

We ordered a seafood pancake and the spicy pork and squid. They included one small container of each banchan (side dishes) as well. The red bean rice was pretty stingy I thought... but I think it's all you can eat rice if your eating there.

The seafood pancake was delicious and most definitely best eaten straight away! Nice crisp outside and soft inside, with the occasional crunch/chew you get from squid (I still can't figure out how to describe the texture of well cooked squid or octopus). It came with a nice tasty dip with lots of acidity that helped cut through the grease, but this is definitely a share plate. Eating a whole one would feel... not great. It had a decent amount of seafood in it, although I wouldn't say the seafood quality was anything really good... but better than I've seen in lots of other places that use crappy frozen mixed seafood where the mussels are mushy and odd tasting which makes me inclined to spit them out..... like a small child... but I don't... I suck it up and make a funny face while I swallow them whole... anyways, what I was trying to say was that the seafood was fine... in as long and ranty a way as possible...

The spicy pork and squid is very expensive but the serving size is massive! It could easily serve 3 or 4 as a main with rice I think. It was nice and spicy and the flavour was savoury and delicious. The pork and squid were both cooked well. The only thing is that this dish is insanely oily. If light or refreshing is what you're going for.... this is not it! 

Kimchi, seaweed, and bean sprout banchan were nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked. I found the fish cake banchan a little bland but that could also be because everything else I had was in flavour country!

All in all, meal was heavy... but was delicious!  My only regret is that they didn't seem to offer more affordable half portions on the menu... but to be fair I didn't ask either. I would go with at least 3 people if you were to eat here, otherwise portions may be too large... but I do love leftovers! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Small Korean restaurant out in the middle of nowhere with decent food. 

I went on a Wednesday evening and it seemed pretty empty and hard to find in the dark. The menu was more unique, I haven't  seen a lot of items on the menu. Even the free side dishes I haven't  had a few of them before. Ended up getting chicken bulgogi and it came out to be fairly big proportion. Flavour wise it was good. Rice and water was unlimited self served refill which was different. 

Probably worth checking out again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"The portions are bigger than you think!!, after spending 9month in Seoul for work, this took me right back. The food was great and tasted authentic!! The location is cozy and the service was fantastic.
I had the seafood pancake (which was twice as think than I have ever seen), the Bimbap, and spicy chicken bulgogi... for 2 people we were stuffed with leftovers!
