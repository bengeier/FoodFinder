{"text":"I pretty much totally agree with Mohammad.  It was really good for the price.  The baklava was pretty old though, but the rest of the food was very fresh."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. The lady at the cash register drops my credit card in a small crack by the register and tells me to come back later to get it. So I go back 4 hours later, and they make me wait another 30 minutes before even attempting to look for it. (Keep in my they probably had down time in between to find it). Finally, they still charge me for the lunch I bought. Very dissatisfied customer. Plus they rip you off on the soda. The cup is tiny and half full of ice, and they don't even fill the drink up all the way. I will never come to this place again."}
{"text":"Customer service was so so,too serious when greeting customers. Food was very good. Portions were big, under 10 bucks not bad.Good Mediterranean food for the price nice view watching saint Catherine street from 1st floor."}
{"text":"The clerk who worked there apparently had a problem with English clients. After we had placed our orders he complained that we did not speak French. He then proceeded to blast the music on max volume.  I would never eat there again. I hope he is fired soon, for that restaurant's reputation is tainted, as other reviewers will corroborate."}
{"text":"Good Mediterranean food for the price. Nothing is amazing over here, but for a late night dinner you can't beat their food for the price. They also tried to create a little \"Ali-Baba\" or \"Aladdin\" Ambiance. Not so great, but hey at least they tried :-)"}
{"text":"We went here the Moroccan guy was very rude. Personnel has no people skills. Food is low-quality and not spiced, such as: dry rice, dry salad, and dry meat. They boast about their shawarma but it's nasty. And no refills for 2$ drink. Not a happy experience. I will never eat here."}
{"text":"Customer service was blah. Food wasn't great. Portions were big, but you pay for it."}
{"text":"Il y a plus de 30 ans j'allais au cinema au centre ville de Montréal et j'arrêtais à ce restaurant libanais pour bien manger à faible prix. Aujourd'hui j'allais pour faire réparer mon iPad et j'en ai profiter pour voir si c'était comme avant.  Eh bien oui. L'assiette combo shawarma etait bonne avec une salade croquante.  Le décor est toujours le même. Le service est amical.  Le seul bémol est la propreté de la salle manger et les toilettes."}
{"text":"First of all, I don't expect much from the Basha Restaurants. Just as decent meal at a decent price. I wanted a quick bite so I ordered a shish taouk.   Service was less than desirable, no greeting and very snippy. The sandwich was the smallest portion I've ever had and flavourless. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Dreadful customer service, they have a female employee who seems to hate male customers and equally hate English-speaking people, whether male, female, or transsexuals. (this seems to be a trend since at the other location, Montreal Trust, they have another female employee with a similar behavior). The food is OK, but the aggressive and rude way this woman interacts with male customers is simply unacceptable, so they wont be getting my money, rather I'll walk another block and go to Koljax, where the food is also good and the employees are a lot friendlier and treat customers with respect and politeness...after all I am paying for my food and it is not a soup kitchen."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars   This is a pretty good place for shawarma plates and shawarma wraps...I'm so surprised by the low rating!   Came on a Saturday afternoon and the place was quite empty...it's located just off St. Catherine on Drummond. You walk upstairs to a warm, aromatic shop.   The storefront is pretty standard for any shawarma place, and they have ample seating. It definitely has a cool Mediterranean vibe to it. You get a really good view of the st. Catherine street which is nice.   The food here is pretty good - really generous shawarma plate servings...salad is fresh, potatoes are crispy and meat is juicy and delicious. I ordered the Shish taouk plate (chicken shawarma) which didn't disappoint!   They have a really extensive menu filled with various meat and chicken shawarma dishes. It is very authentic. It's also halal which is great. The prices are pretty fair as well ($10-13) for a plate.   I'd definitely recommend this place for a quick dinner!"}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Shawarma and Veggie Plate for my friend . Chicken Shawarma was moist and tasty . Veggie Plate was good as well."}
