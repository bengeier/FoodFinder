{"text":"Lets first start off with AMAZING! !! Osaka Japan has never let me down. Outstanding food. And by far the best teriyaki sauce ever. I go there every Saturday after work it's becoming a ritual thing. They are very friendly and always with good attitude and I think personally this place is way better than Panda Express"}
{"text":"ILoved the Teriyaki Chicken! Fresh & the price was right! My son enjoyed the beef Teriyaki!"}
{"text":"My BF and I was just wondering the mall and got hungry so we went to the food court deciding on what we wanted to eat. And we came across Osaka. I figured an Asian food joint in the mall should be good like Panda Express. So we decided to order from this place. I got the Shrimp plate with a side of Fried Rice and like any shrimp plate it usually costs more and my BF got the Teriyaki plate  with White Rice I believe. For the money we spent on it, I was kinda disappointed at the amount of shrimp they gave me. I got like about maybe 6 shrimps and they were tiny. I love shirmp and all and I was expecting at least a little more on my plate. But not a surprise like any food restaurants they can get very greedy with any seafood because it already is costly for them to buy it. 

The people were pretty friendly, and you can watch the chef cook in front of you. After the meat was done cooking he said a little chant and poured some sauce on the meat. It was pretty interesting. Maybe some chant hoping that the meat tastes good. lol

The Food was OK in my book, I mean I cant complain because they are fast food and not no gourmet restaurant. My BF liked his food.

Overall I wouldnt mind eating here again if I'm ever in this mall but Im ordering something different."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE.  Spent my Father's Day weekend hanging over a toilet from their sushi. Owner doesn't speak English, waiting days for a return call to never get one. Finally got a manager on the phone, who tried offering me $30 gift card! Are you kidding me??? Why would I eat at that place after getting sick as hell?!? Wouldn't do anything else, asked me if I had a hospital bill to prove it...place is a joke. Owner is irresponsible. Do YOURSELF A FAVOR AND AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Or, spend the following day puking and crapping over a toilet. Contacted Maricopa Health Department for follow up."}
{"text":"Compared to a lot of the other teriyaki-style food court places, Osaka Japan is just okay. 

I came here on a busy day before Christmas. The service was legitimately sub-par, but the food was average. I ordered the standard teriyaki plate, but subbed fried rice for the white rice. The plate also came with steamed veggies as well. The fried rice lacked flavor, almost like that of plain white rice, and didn't have many veggies in it. Maybe a few peas and carrot chunks scattered throughout. The chicken was alright, albeit a tad bit overcooked, but I would have preferred that over unercooked. The veggies were good, but weren't \"steamed\" as advertised. Rather, they were fried/sauteed on the same griddle that was used to cook the meat. I paid close to $7 for the plate plus the fried rice upgrade. 

I can say with great confidence that the service and food quality is better at the similar-style restaurant in Fashion Square's food court, but it's really nothing to complain about."}
{"text":"Huge chicken plate for under $10. The flavors are authentic, and healthy.  I really enjoy this place and literally come here on week nights for take out when I don't want to cook.  All hail the food court."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time on my lunch break and the food was excellent, and very tasty. However, this was in 2014. Ever since they got new cooks, the food quality has gone way down. I'm not sure if they're not trained, or what, but they put way too much teriyaki sauce and don't cook it right. The vegetables are raw and they over cook the meat. I can tell a difference in the rice too, it taste like it has been left for days."}
{"text":"I love this place. The price is great the food is great as well. Best place at the food court by far"}
{"text":"Went in ready for a good Teriyaki Beef Lunch. What a disappointment. The rice was day old, dry and clumpy. The vegetables were taste less and seemed re-heated. The beef was over half grizzle and fat. Not very good. Don't waste your time on this one. Its not worth the drive, the price or the wait."}
{"text":"Very nice folks run this little food court spot. I assume it's family owned. You can watch them prepare your food fresh before your eyes.

I always order the $5.99 special, which includes a drink and a generous serving of teriyaki chicken served on, in my case, a huge bed of vegetables. They kindly allow me to pass on the starch and just give me more veggies. The California rolls aren't bad either.

They offer a frequent diner card which entitles you to a free teriyaki chicken or California roll after six meals purchased. Did I mention the free drink refills? 

Not the best Japanese cuisine I've ever had, but far from the worst. The main appeal, I think, is the consistency of the people working at Osaka. Not at all what you would expect at a food court. Great."}
