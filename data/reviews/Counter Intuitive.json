{"text":"This was a cool lowkey spot in old town. It's pretty dark inside and the atmosphere was like a local dive bar type of feel. The inside reminded me of a place you'd see in la. They had an awesome selection of drinks and beer. Would go here again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bars in Scottsdale. Small and casual craft-cocktail lounge with fun themed decor and a huge menu of unique and delicious drinks. Since it is pretty small, sometimes it gets very busy and it can take a while to get a drink. I hope they expand, but in the meantime definitely give this place a try and don't give up if it's too crowded. Themes change every three or four months and they close down for a bit in between."}
{"text":"The drinks were great and the bartenders. Thank you Kiefer and Sam were so much fun!! Will definitely come back next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Counter Intuitive is the perfect late night spot for excellent food and drinks. It's so good! I wish it had been around a couple years ago while I still lived in Scottsdale, but I'm just happy there's such a great place to hang out at whenever we're in town.   My husband and I visited on a Friday night, and everything was so tasty we went back the next night with friends to try the rest of the menu. They have a rotating menu that corresponds with a theme, and everything from the food and cocktails to the music and art on the walls fits with the current theme. We went during their Picasso's Visit to Cuba. I'm Cuban and from Miami, so this was an especially special treat for me. Getting restaurant food with Cuban, Spanish or Caribbean flavors was next to impossible when I lived in Phoenix but Counter Intuitive pulled it off. The mofongo (Puerto Rican) was delish and the fried yuca and tostones really hit the spot. Everyone we were with loved their meals. The drinks were super good too. I'm a fan of classic daiquiris, but we also tried about six different cocktails and they were all delicious.  On top of having great food (especially late night great eats - also not easy to find in Phoenix) and cocktails, the ambiance and lighting at this place rocks. We felt so comfortable we lost track of time our first night and just hung around for three hours. The bar area feels welcoming and is really nice for standing around and socializing, with bar height seating in that space and shorter (but longer) tables in the back. The layout is really well thought out - not a surprise considering how great everything else was.  I can't say enough good things about Counter Intuitive. We can't wait to go back and try whatever menu they'll have next time we're in town. We highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect late-night spot! We had the Gator Bites; they were so amazing that before we knew it we had ordered half the menu. The gumbo was some of the best I have ever had, and I have had a lot. The deviled eggs are a must. But no matter how much you eat, make room for dessert- the mini beignets are out of control!  Though I usually don't stray from single malt, neat or bourbon on ice, the cocktails are impressive. With all the creative concoctions on display its apparent that there's a bit of friendly competition between the kitchen and the bar. Go there. Do it!"}
{"text":"This is the best cocktail bar in old town! Try the bites and provisions if you can, this place has good atmosphere I highly recommend expanding your palate and trying the mixologist specials. BEB (break even bottle) was a highlight, as I got to taste an aged collector bottle variety of rum, for a fair price, that otherwise I would've just been able to read about!"}
{"text":"Counter Intuitive, the next big thing in the line of Kazperski establishments does not fall short of the high bar set by its predecessors: cowboy Ciao and Kaz Bar. Led by the creative Kiefer Gilbert (recognized in Phoenix New Times best of 2016) behind the rail and the veteran innovator Jason Asher, CI has a cocktail menu that will dazzle your palate and an inviting yet unpretentious atmosphere that will ensure a great time. If you haven't checked it out already, do yourself a favor and move it to the top of your list."}
{"text":"Love this place for its many unique qualities and incredibly innovative cocktails! Much needed change for old town"}
{"text":"I stopped here with some friends here on Saturday night because we were told they have the best cocktails. Im all for paying extra for good quality drinks. I bought a round for a friend of mine which was 2 Moscow Mules & a sparkling water. When I got my tab I was completely dumbfounded. The sparkling water was $15! FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR WATER!!!! Never in my life have I paid that much for water. And if I ever was to pay that much, I best be sipping it on a cliff off a coast with incredible scenery, not some 1000+ sq ft bar in Old town. And to top it off, both my friend and I were not impressed with the Moscow Mules."}
{"text":"Came here to catch up with old friends while in Scottsdale. The experience was great; mostly because of the staff. They make drinks well, like most reputable snazzy cocktail bars do. They're Staff, however, go above and beyond to make you comfortable, from pointing out open tables as they come up to friendly drink suggestions, they make you feel at home. Thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a charming bar with an incredibly unique cocktail menu, come to Counter Intuitive!  The bartenders are passionate about the cocktails and put lots of love and attention into every delicious, hand-crafted drink.    Show up at 9:55 pm, or else you'll definitely have to wait for a spot to open or stand around the bar area.  This place is filled by 9:59 pm (no exaggeration) and they open at 10."}
{"text":"Really great craft cocktails. Its a good little spot with really good bartenders the cocktail list is really good and if you have a certain taste they will come up with something for you."}
{"text":"I honestly loved everything about this place. Chill music, lighting, awesome bartenders which results in amazing drinks. I tried over 5 different drinks, glad I wasn't paying!"}
{"text":"After months of failed attempts, we finally stayed awake late enough to try this place out! And now I thoroughly wish I could stay awake until midnight every single Friday and Saturday... The joys of being old...  We came here for post-dinner drinks on date night, and I am not exaggerating when I say they were the best cocktails I've ever had in my life. The theme of the bar rotates every 3-4 months, so we were here during their Chinese theme, and the menu was separated by parts of the world. They had Asian inspired cocktails from Oahu, Los Angeles, New York, and one other that I can't remember right now. The bottom line is these guys are genius when it comes to great drinks; the guys who own it are the top mixologists in AZ and they employ only the top bartenders.  This place is a do not miss. They're only open from 10pm-2am Thursday-Saturday, but we got there about 5 minutes before they opened, and as soon as they did it was packed, so plan ahead of you want a spot at the bar. Also, this is a late 20s/ early 30s crowd, so none of your normal old town idiots are here. It's hands down the best bar in old town."}
{"text":"AMAZING PLACE! definitely a diamond in the rough in Old Town Scottsdale. Amazing craft cocktails and ambiance."}
{"text":"Very comfortable, inviting, and friendly metropolitan speakeasy that prioritizes high-quality cocktails, high-quality staff, and superior service.  Moreover, it attracts a great mix of people which, in my opinion, says a lot about the place (i.e., less of the typically nauseating Scottsdale douchebaggery here, although they too will inevitably seep in once the hour is late enough).  The spirits behind the bar are pretty impressive for Old Town (I'm a bourbon fan) and I'm hoping they'll be adding to their collection.    I'm so happy that Counter Intuitive changed their days and hours -- there's finally a seriously great speakeasy in Old Town for those of us who go to bed when everyone else is just going out!   ;)"}
{"text":"Craft cocktails in an urban speakeasy - come here to sip on serious spirits. Massive mezcal list, for those who love some smoky goodness. Select your cocktail of choice, made with housemade syrups and specialty bitters. My Southern Slant made with sweet potato bourbon, pecan bitters was super unique - flavors worked together well, Thanksgiving on the rocks.   Conveniently located in Old Town Scottsdale next to Cowboy Ciao. Cocktail program now rotates every 3 weeks, instead of 6 months. Drinks-only, so head elsewhere for a bite beforehand!"}
{"text":"Awesome speak easy hidden away in the heart of old town Scottsdale. Came on a Saturday night and it surprisingly wasn't busy or packed which was nice as we had a large group. Atmosphere was awesome and dimly lit and super chill. Music was on point and just the right volume to still have conversations. Bartenders were very attentive and didn't take long to get drinks. Drinks are actually better craft cocktails and cost about the same or even less than a mixed well drink at some of the more popular clubs in the area. Fun fact, the drink menu has little tidbits about popular movies that had scenes and locations filmed on Arizona so it was cool to read about some of my favorite movies having been filmed in my state. Dope spot. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm so happy I came here, and cannot wait to come back!  Counter Intuitive is a craft cocktail space, with expertise behind the bar.  The space is limited, and fills up quickly. Luckily, stars aligned as my friend and I walked in, and two bar seats were available.  To be honest, I do not remember the name of the drinks I tried. The menu is elaborate and changes every six months. You choose your poison based on what sounds good, with a \"complexity level\" listed next to it, ranked 1-10. I had ordered a 6 and it was like a flavor bomb went off in my mouth. I was hooked. Hooked onto two more, probably more than I should've. But when in Rome....  This is a Must Try. I'll be returning ASAP.  Sometimes I just feel so lucky to live in this area. Counter Intuitive is definitely the latest reason why."}
{"text":"Coolest place in all of Scottsdale in my opinion. I lived in old town and north Scottsdale for the past ten years, right as this amazing spot was opening up I moved away :( on a visit last weekend I finally got to check out Counter Intuitive and I am SO glad I did. Best cocktails, staff, ambiance and crowd. This is not the Scottsdale douche scene this is the cool vibe to enjoy a damn good drink that a true bartender has made for you. I cannot say enough about how great this place is. I was here with 6 girls and two guy friends and we all left ranting and raving about our own experience. Now if only CI was in my new home, Austin!   Thanks for a great time Counter Intuitive!!!"}
{"text":"This place is intimate and exclusive (open two days a week and limited hours) and has a speakeasy atmosphere. Walking in I honestly felt like I was somewhere exciting and foreign. They rotate the theme, menu and decor every few months. Most of the decor used is for sale as well. I mean how freaking creative is that!? The menu book was so beautiful and unique I actually considered stealing it.   I came during the Shanghai Social club concept and had the Sippin tea in the LBC and Stewed. The BEST cocktails I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. The mixologists are incredible at what they do and you can tell how much they enjoy it.   The menu is a little overwhelming because everything sounds lovely and somewhat exotic. I asked our bartender for suggestions and was hooked first sip. Truthfully, I would have probably loved everything here, but I'll be back for the next theme! All of them from here on out."}
{"text":"Late night hidden gem. You need to go see Micah & Keifer & enjoy some of the best, inventive, creative cocktails in AZ. Their hours are only 10pm-2am. It is next door to Cowboy Ciao and is the perfect place for a late night date or just a good time. Go enjoy!"}
{"text":"Interesting place.  We went with a friend who is fairly new in town.  We decided to have a couple of cocktails and the charcuterie board.  The cocktails were very good, I had the Aviation, it is a gin cocktail.  We noticed the menu had changed from the pictures.  I was looking forward to the deviled eggs, but they don't offer that anymore.  So we settled for the board, it was fairly large, and with a lot of interesting items.  It had duck confit, hmm I'm still not sure what I think of it.  I also thought we might have been there too early, so there were not many people and the ambiance was a little meh. I will give it another try, because I think it is a good concept."}
{"text":"Best handcrafted drinks in scottsdale. Not only is the place really small but they change the ambience, music, drinks and decor every 3/4 months. When I went it was a San Fran, NY, Hawaii vibe. So the drinks were all based on those places, each page was meant to make you feel like you were in that city. They also auction off all the decor in the restaurant. I have yet to have had a bad drink so I highly recommend trying it. Also another tip, they're only open Friday and Saturday nights from 10-2. Get there at 10 if you do want to have a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"What a great place! Unique and interesting cocktails, served up in a fun way. I really liked the vibe, the service, and the end product."}
{"text":"I docked a star as I discovered that our lady server added more tip to my bill than I authorized.  Service wasn't great, and I would have tipped more if I felt it was warranted.   Lesson: Always check your statements."}
{"text":"I have been dying to check this place out since it opened, but Friday and Saturday from 10pm - 2am was a bit of a challenge for me...especially living in downtown Phoenix.  I was so excited when I heard the announcement that they were now opening at 8pm, so we decided to stop in last night after dinner.  Lively, fun atmosphere, great and engaging bartenders, fun, rotating themes and extensive drink menu.  We were a little overwhelmed by all of the choices, so we told the bartender what flavors we liked and he mixed us up something tasty...definitely out of our comfort zone, but good all the same to try something I wouldn't normally order.  Excited to see what the next iteration of this cool bar will be...definitely a draw to keep you coming back!"}
{"text":"Great spot if you love service with a bad attitude, hipsters and millennials. Wouldn't return just based on the stuffy atmosphere provided by arrogant bar tenders. Your not City Hall."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST. Drinks are amazingly creative and the service even better. Sam spoke with us all evening and was so interesting and kind. He helped us figure out which drinks we would love which was so nice because I never know what to order. I said something not strong but not sugary sweet and boom he made it. All the other employees were equally as nice and told us other neat places to check out in the valley. This place is perfect for a fun date night stop or drinks with friends. The decor is very fun and they were playing great music. 10/10"}
{"text":"So bummed...my friends and I typically stop in here almost every weekend. Drinks are good, atmosphere is chill, and honestly I don't have a problem with $15 drinks when the quality and service is good. This past Saturday, I got kicked out with my crew. I've worked in, consulted for, and owned over 30 restaurants in my life and that was a first for me. We went in for my buddy's wife's graduation party and a friend had given her some balloons...apparently the hipster bartender in the tiny bowler hat thought that wasn't a good look for his bar. He threw our check at us after the first round and said, and I quote, \"Some people just don't fit in here and shouldn't be our clientele.\" I'm not embarrassed for myself at all, but I'm embarrassed for for the management and ownership of the establishment, because if you make a habit of saying things like that to people like us, you won't last long. There was a very nice young manager who came out to speak with us, and he backed his bartender-which is exactly what I would have done-but I think if he knew exactly what went down he would have fired him on the spot. I'm posting this not to bury you, but because as a fellow industry person I want us all to succeed and I hope this is a teachable moment for all of you. Good luck CI, but unfortunately you've lost mine and my network's business and goodwill."}
{"text":"Always an interesting menu concept and the place to be for craft cocktails. Numerous legends frequent behind the bar here. If you want an amazing cocktail that you'll never find anywhere else, this is your spot!"}
{"text":"Counter Intuitive is such a cool place; up until last week I had no idea they switched up their theme every three or four months, which I think is a really interesting idea. We went when the theme was The Final Countdown, so they had 80s music playing and used record covers for the menus. It was really fun!   For drinks I got a Love Crusher, which was good but not great. All of their cocktails sound very cool and original, but if you're like me and not super into cocktails, it's a little harder to find something you like. I wish they had a few more basic options to choose from. But otherwise I had a really good time here!"}
{"text":"Drink was good, great vibe and well put together.   Wasn't treated to well by the bartender. Girlfriends sister went up to the bar to order a drink after waiting for a server and she was told to go sit back down and someone would serve her. Drinks are also pricey but what do you expect?   Otherwise dig the carved ice and the old fashioned I drank."}
{"text":"Cool spot- pretty clever menu. Enjoyed a complex cocktail that had my fave- mezcal! Will def come back if I'm ever traveling to the area again."}
{"text":"Great cocktails. The guys that run it are true professionals. The menu theme changes every couple of months. When I went it was a New Orleans theme. I had a Pain Killer. It was delicious and definitely took the pain away. The only downside is it's only open a couple nights a week. I would be there more oftren if not."}
{"text":"Being an East coaster, I miss the bars that truly concentrate on the fantastic, write home about, cocktails. Well, Counter Intuitive made that list for me. And I love that they rotate their theme every 6 months! Currently Chinatown themed, looking forward to the next change in May!"}
{"text":"One of the best cocktails I've ever had. This is true mixology. Love the decor and cozy feel it gives off. The bartender was very nice and the crowd seemed more chill than most Scottsdale bars."}
{"text":"If you've met me for a hot minute, you know that I rarely drink.  However, I would gladly sacrifice a hangover for this place.    The bar is theme-based and the theme rotates every few months.  Their current theme is Chinatown, so everything on the menu aligns with this.  You'll find a lot of citrus and ginger flavors.  My boyfriend and I went there the other night and had a variety of cocktails.  My favorite one is the Sippin Tea in the LBC, recommended by my lovely mixologist.  It has a strong yuzu flavor, which is a japanese tangerine with really strong floral notes, and is delightful.  The prevalent alcohol is mezcal, which adds a really nice, smokey and throaty finish.  Everything else I tried was complex but well balanced and absolutely enjoyable to drink.  If you need a respite from the regular old town scene, I highly recommend coming over to Counter Intuitive!"}
{"text":"I love you, CI. I don't make it here nearly enough given the distance from home and limited hours, but every time I do, I vow to get here more often. Why?   The drinks are fantastic- creative cocktails that introduce me to new ingredients and combinations that always come out looking beautiful and tasting fabulous. I miss the green drink from Agua Caliente menu, and am still mourning the loss of some unbelievable whiskey drinks from Chinatown underground. Thankfully, the current edition has one called Time Has Come that is amazing enough to make up for it.  The staff behind the bar- incredibly talented bunch. No matter who makes the drink (though admittedly, I'm a Keifer fan), it turns out solid (not true at other bars where you have to hope that the one great mixologist on staff is working the night you show up). They smile when you walk in and are helpful when it comes to asking what you like and steering you towards a cocktail that will be a good fit.   The food menu is worth blowing the diet- the small list of options is not the health food I try to stick to, but always exactly what I want after the second round. Like the drink list, the food menu changes often, but if they ever have some version of a Cuban sandwich or deviled eggs, just say yes and thank me later.  The place isn't very big (though really, it's the perfect size) and seems to fill up later in the night, so I suggest getting there early to get a seat at the bar. If you haven't been, you must go. As for me, I must go back."}
{"text":"Our bartender was informative, and helpful in every way. We told him what we normally like and he gave us a few options. My friend and I got two drinks each and all four were spot on with flavors and appearance. Worth every penny"}
{"text":"Drinks are well-crafted and much detail goes into each one. Perfection in a glass. The staff is very friendly, and the happy hour is a fantastic deal! A must do in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I love this hidden little bar. A little off the path of the entertainment district in oldtown but I do recommend coming to start your night off here for tasty cocktails made by knowledgeable bartenders. Also, have a tasty small bites menu for you to nibble on things while Enjoying your time with your friends!"}
{"text":"Wow!  What an incredible night we had thanks to the guys at Counter Intuitive.  They went above and beyond to accommodate us for a bachelorette party, even going so far as bringing us yummy desserts from the restaurant next door.  Drinks were fantastic (mojitos with loads of fresh mint were out of this world!).  Service impeccable, we will definitely be back next trip to AZ!!  Thanks for making our gal feel extra special!!!"}
{"text":"It was my graduation, kid of a reason to celebrate. We had just left dinner and on our way to celebrate. We stop in, a great friend handed me flowers and and balloons. Which apparently celebrating is not allowed at this establishment, because I was told that \"we were not their clientele,\" okay. Not sure why? We had ordered tequila shot, it is a tequila bar, but shamed when asked for lime, them the bartender poured water In Our shot glasses, probably thinking they were water, no biggie but when asked to replace because they were water now, we were asked to leave. I paid but really think we deserved better. Will never return!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the dale. Don't get me wrong, you'll still get your douche crew here but not as bad. The bartenders are attentive and the food is delectable. The menu changes every quarter. Get here early and get a table! Enjoy some culture away from the guidos and fake plastic surgery that is Scottsdale. Ya welcome"}
{"text":"Counter Intuitive is an innovative bar located in the heart of Old Town! Pretty much everything in the bar changes each quarter, from the menu to the decor (and they do not skimp on cool decorations). I would describe the current theme as Hollywood meets AZ! The menu references movies filmed right here in Arizona, with corresponding drinks named after references to each film. The current decor is modern, upscale, and trendy but with Arizona touches like stuffed jackalopes (google it!) and cow skulls. The drinks are phenomenal! True craft cocktails at reasonable prices, both of my drinks tonight were $12 each."}
{"text":"Great place with some interesting and extremely tasty drinks!!!  Haven't tried the food yet but I am sure it's as great as the cocktails."}
{"text":"Good drinks, enthusiastic staff that will make excellent recommendations, fun environment"}
{"text":"Counter Intuitive is one of, if not, my favorite drink spots in Old Town. If you're unfamiliar with the concept, they completely change out the theme and entire menu of the restaurant every 3 months or so. The talent behind every drink is spectacular and the entire staff is so helpful, knowledgable, and awesome even in the midst of a fully packed bar. They auction off everything you see inside before changing the theme so put yourself on the wait list if you see anything from a poster, to the cups, to the lights that you like! They open at 10pm for drinks and serve a small food menu usually around 11pm (depending on when Cowboy Ciao closes because they share the kitchen). The cocktails are out of this world amazing and the list is extensive so be prepared to have your mind blown. It's not your typical Old Town spot and that's what makes it so damn great!"}
{"text":"\"If you like pina coladas, and getting caught in the rain...\" come here, they're delicious!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a chill bar to hangout with friends and have casual conversations then this is a great place to go to! Their menu change every couple months based on the theme. It was Japanese themed menu a couple weeks ago. Not sure what it is now but the drinks sounded tropical themed. All the drinks are very strong so be careful! Definitely not a big place nor a place to get wild so I would stay away if you have a huge crowd."}
{"text":"Wow!! Do you enjoy speakeasies? Anything from classic cocktails to something with a twist. There is some serious mixology talent here. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Counter Intuitive lives up to the hype!!  After visiting the bar on a Saturday night, I can see why it has been rated one of the top craft cocktails bars in the country.  The decor is super eclectic, and from what I understand, it changes every 6 months.  Right now, it has an Asian flair to their menu and decor, so the place is filled with paper lanterns and fun tchotchkes strewn about.  As for the cocktails, they are not only beautiful to look at, but they are mighty tasty.  We tasted the Stilettos in Hand, which was a vodka based drink mixed with thai basil, lemongrass, grapefruit and bitters, and it was absolutely fantastic!  Nice balance of sweet, sour, dry.....it was a perfect cocktail.  One thing to note, is that they are a cocktail bar, so no beer here.  You'll have to go elsewhere for a brewski.    If you're into fun cocktails with a whimsical atmosphere, then definitely come check out what Counter Intuitive is all about!!"}
{"text":"Loved their tequila drink and the one with Yuzu. I wish I could remember the names! Service was great, ambiance we fun an intimate all at the same time. Only sucky part was the bathroom line."}
{"text":"Basically I plan most of my Saturday nights with an end goal of hitting Counter Intuitive. The places oozes hipness and the cocktails are sublime. The pop-up themes are super cool."}
{"text":"This place sucks. I went for a cocktail, noticed there was no music on, none of the bartenders came up to me, then a server said they don't usually open during the week and it's a private party. I'm glad I sat there for 10 minutes without knowing they weren't going to serve me.  Counter Intuitive? You don't say."}
{"text":"Incredible selection of craft cocktails. Describing it cannot do it justice. You must try them in person. What a gem of a bar."}
{"text":"When I discovered this place I was so excited! The food is amazing the cocktails are so unique and the staff was so friendly. My girlfriends and I would come here to end a long work day or start our Saturday nights... but the last time we went in to get some cocktails there was a new bartender, I had never seen her before and she was extremely rude and her service was very unprofessional to the point my girlfriend and I didn't want to wait for our food we wanted to throw down cash and bolt. We haven't been back since and I've stopped recommending this spot. Super sad! I miss the chill atmosphere and creative drinks"}
{"text":"Love this spot! Dope menu for any type of drinker out there. Low lighting and laidback vibes set this place apart. A must visit for craft cocktail fans in the Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in old town for amazing libations and amazing service, friendly conversation, and spirits education you can't get anywhere else around."}
{"text":"This place always makes me happy, I love sitting at the bar but the hi tops have a cool vibe too. Cocktails are extensive and impressive, bartenders bring their A game every time."}
{"text":"Love this bar. Not your typical Scottsdale crowd. It has a speakeasy feel to it. LOVE the cocktails, especially their Tom Collins."}
{"text":"When a place tries to pretend that waiting 40 minutes for a drink is totally normal and okay...that's a red flag! Be aware when coming here!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place. Creative cocktails.  Friendly. Cozy. Great presentation with with food drinks and menu."}
{"text":"I love this place! I went for the first time on a Wednesday night, and there were quite a few people there but a lot of places to sit. The drinks were great and the bartenders were very knowledgeable and helpful. It's kind of in a weird place, but there's a huge parking lot behind it with a lot of spaces available. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best drink spots and definitely a hidden gem in Scottsdale, it is truly amazing!  For a bit, I wondered if I would ever find a place that could serve up well made drinks in an environment that allows exploration of new drinks and a great place to socialize ... one similar to Bitter & Twisted. Counterintuitive is just that! From hearing of this place from a colleague, we decided to have a girl's night out and was amused that the current theme was \"Asian\".   Upon entering, it was as if we were transported to an underground bar in Los Angeles or San Francisco. It was adored with typical \"Asian\" decor, such as lanterns, straw hats, cats and even an old Chinese film on their TV. The menu itself was based off of cities and historial Asian figures, it was very fun!  We were served a delicious concoction in tea cups as a complimentary drink consisting of gin, cognac and a plethora of other alcohols ... but it was pure magic at how delicious and well crafted it was. As for the other cocktails, we ordered a cocktail from each page to get a good taste of what they were providing for their current theme. There was not one drink I would not order again. There was one drink, the only alcoholic boba beverage, I did not enjoy that much purely because it was the mixture of tart coconut and the boba absorbed most of the alcohol making it literally- hard to swallow.  Besides, the well crafted drinks (I could drink everything on the menu- if possible) the service and how the bar operates is phenomenal. I love the idea of an always changing theme and really shows their willingness to adapt and pushes limits. Definitely a new favorite and will keep coming back, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, the bartender Sam made me a drink called God's angry dick. It was like sipping cum from the almighty.   Glory be to the highest."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and was very impressed.  Place was packed in about 15 minutes after they opened the doors.  The theme was asian inspired and the decor was both unique and interesting.  The cocktails were outstanding, great vibe and the bartenders know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Although they didn't open until 6:00 when we were out for Friday happy hour this place was worth the wait! Great atmosphere and unbelievable cocktails! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome hip bar. Went during the Chinese theme... The crowd is friendly, the service is awesome, and the atmosphere is very relaxing.  The drinks are average, but everything else makes up for it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, from the cool atmosphere to the delicious food & crafty cocktails-- five stars!! Oh & did I mention for happy hour all the drinks are half off before 9pm?! Score!  Went on a Friday night at 8 & it was moderately busy but my friend & I were able to grab a table right away. Our server explained the drink menu since neither one of us had been before, and gave recommendations as well. I got the Europe in a single serving (normally its a punch bowl style for 3-4 people). The cocktails here are extremely creative & VERY tasty. Both my friend & I really enjoyed our drinks.  Food- I ordered the Cubano sandwich was was delicious! The pickle really brought the sandwich together & it was just a really meaty, cheesy, savory, delicious combo.  They play a variety of different music from AFI to Drake & the place just has a great vibe to it."}
{"text":"New York's hottest club is: Counter Intuitive.  This club has everything: it's in Phoenix, it's actually a bar, and it's themed like a New Orleans estate sale of a fictional/deceased Bartholomew Chesterfield Ignatius Sugarman, who may or may not be a midget.   The theme will change right when you get used it, and you'll love it.   It has obituaries, bacon beignets, and drinks that taste like effervescent Flintstones vitamin molly water.   This club has a Peas-Sco Sour with snap-pea infused pisco, egg white, watermelon, & yuzu.   It has whiskey, tequila, pineapple, lime, AND coffee liqueur in a melee of hell yessery.   It's website-less, it's late-night, it's weekend-only, it's the brainlovechild of Cowboy Ciao + Crudo collaboration, and anyone who's everyone is there."}
{"text":"A gator bite in Scottsdale tonight!  From those who bring you Kazimierz World Wine Bar and Cowboy Ciao, (and in the space adjacent to the latter), you will find Counter Intuitive.   Here, you will imbibe the likes of \"Cuffs & Buttons\" (brandy, sloe gin, etc), Sazerac (with a take-away flask, should you choose & we did since we had a nice \"Arizona Cocktail Week\" promo price) or a good old Pimm's Cup. You'll enjoy the kind of fare as determined by theme - the current being \"New Orleans Estate Sale\" -complete with a fictional character, his obit on the back of the menu and a curious selection of personal items inspired by this character. These items are available for viewing at the front door.   Foodwise...think beignets and rabbit rillettes, gator bites and gumbo. We loved the shrimp remoulade deviled eggs ($2 per) as well as the bacon beignets ($8 heap) though my tastebuds can't vouch for the bacon content. Our server brought one from the kitchen (pre-cooked dough) to show the bacon bits. There are flecks but I need chunks, I imagine. Service was exceptional for a second night open.   The lights are low. The spirits high. We enjoyed.   Open 10 pm - 2 am, Friday and Saturday only for cocktails and late night bites. All other times the space is available for private party rental."}
{"text":"This place. Seriously. Is. Awesome. Even though it can get a bit crazy on weekend nights, I have to say that I will fight through a crowd and scream at the top of my lungs at a bartender here because that may be what is necessary to enjoy the best cocktails in Old Town (if not the valley). I love that they are creative in their concoctions. I adore that they work a theme into every drink with each rotation. The drinks are strong, and I am ok with that. Wish I could head down to CI every weekend to enjoy a fanciful beverage (or two) and the vibrant atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Cool mini mixology spot that changes the theme about 3 times a year. Great friendly staff that will guide you to what is good or worth drinking. Food looks good but didn't try this time. Will be back."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere - the fact that it is more lounge/speakeasy like than most of the other bars in the area.  Coming from NYC, I had missed a good lounge bar.  The rotating themes is really an innovative concept and the staff are knowledgeable and friendly.  Great age range in the place, too - not full of millennials."}
{"text":"Kinda interesting place. Small place with a cool bar.  Good spot for small groups.  Our drinks we meh. Took a while to receive  and were seemingly void of alcohol.  Not terribly expensive however not really sure why we spent $9 for soda and ginger beer.  Probably won't be coming back here again and with the amount of bars within walking distance, I would most likely refer out of town friends to check out another spot."}
