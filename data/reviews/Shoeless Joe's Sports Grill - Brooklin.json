{"text":"Nice clean restaurant, good service. Great for family dining.

Build your own sundae was a hit with the kids, and different menus for children under 7 & 12 (different serving sizes), which is nice.

This visit I had the Chipotle Bison Burger with waffle cut fries. Very tasty burger and the waffle cut fries are a really nice change."}
{"text":"Good service very bad food burnt dry and way overpriced $13.00 for a burnt burger. I will never go again"}
{"text":"The new menu is awful... wings are priced out of this world and the best burgers they had are gone... will not return"}
{"text":"Their menu carries a fairly good selection of standard chain restaurant sports bar offerings and they've got some pretty interesting fun drinks I wouldn't mind trying, but the service is horrible. The food came quickly but the waitress didn't check on us once and we had to flag her down to ask for the bill after a 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"A few years back this was the saviour of Brooklin!
The only place to go with the family for a half decent bite to eat or to go with the fellas/girls to watch a game and have a brew.
So as time and aparently the idea of quality and customer service declined so has patronage.
Now as anyone that has eaten at this place in the recent past would agree ..YUCK! Food is horribly prepared and presented. The idea of serving quality is no where on the radar for this place. The service isn't too bad, they try.. You have to admit seeing the owner sitting at the bar with serving and kitchen staff drinking is at all what you want when all you can think is ..\"Gee I'd really like a napkin\" 
Won't be going back or ever letting anyone I know go back


*update* this place has been written up a few times for health violations, you might notice that the the green pass may not be in the window on occasion!"}
{"text":"Service is fine and friendly, the food was average if a bit pricey. A sport fan's heaven as they had at least 10 tv's that we could count from where we sat with at least 5 different sports channels playing. It was decent enough...it just didn't wow us."}
{"text":"I've been to other Shoeless Joe locations thankfully, as I'd hate to judge a whole franchise on my experience here. The staff are friendly enough but the food is a total let down and waste. Pretty much everyone said their meal was tasteless and bland. The fish and chips had a fish component that was all batter and hardly any fish, the lemon chicken bowl didn't taste at all, not even of lemon. I bet this place is ok for drinks but as competitive as the sports bar market is nowadays, there are so many better alternatives. Sorry for the 1 star but it really wasn't good."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this location in a while but decided to stop by for a quick lunch.  Not sure when it was renovated, but it was really nice - clean, comfortable, updated.  I sat in the bar and had a salad, I can't remember the name but it had a chipotle ranch dressing and blackened chicken.  It was great!  Really fresh, fairly healthy, and surprisingly filling for a salad.  Definitely a good place to stop for a good meal (saw a few other things on the menu that I'd like to try) and a nice experience."}
{"text":"I have been to Shoeless Joe's on several occasions and was very surprised by the previous reviews as I have never experienced poor service or poor quality food.  The diversity of the menu is what I would expect from Shoeless Joe's and the quality of food commiserate with a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. It one of two bars in the area to hang out at...don't be out to late here though because it closes early! Had a couple bad experiences here prior and the owner was apt to fix them on more than one occasion. As for as it being open late it is not. Stopped by for a couple beverages on a Tuesday evening and to my dismay the front door was locked and blinds were down. When I called to find out if they were open the girl who answered said they closed at midnight. I mentioned I see a bunch of people sitting around the bar, a dozen or more, through the blinds and she still said she had shut everything down. Just disappointing when I walked there and expected it to be open till at least 1. oh well. However, Shoeless has some great wings and great late night menu to choose from."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed when stopping for a meal here.  It is one of the typical chain restaurants but they have an extensive menu and they do it well.  The burgers are excelent, good tap selection and tasty sandwiches.  Give it a try and you will be a regular."}
