{"text":"Great food, especially the cabbage rolls, at affordable prices.  Bar has a nice selection of beer and liquors.  Bartenders and staff seem friendly.  Great little place for lunch, dinner, or drinks!"}
{"text":"Great Neighborhood old time bar. The pot roast and stuffed cabbage are \"oh my gawd\" from what I've heard. The pot roast melts in your mouth and it's enough to keep you full for a wekk. So expect delicious homestyle cooking and large portions. You won't leave hungry. The Mac n Cheese bites are deliciously crisp and melty (but not on the menu yet so you need to ask for them.) The prices are excellent. Most entrees are under $10 and the menu is stocked with homemade favorites like meat loaf, chicken parm, and burgers.  If you like good food, you will like it here. 

I went in expecting Miller time and found Thirsty dog on tap. They even carried Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier MÃ¤rzen, the tastiest smoky beer ever.  They don't have a beer list, so be sure to check out the beer cooler. 

This place is the real deal. Don't expect fluffy redbull drinks or fruit loop vodka. It's liquor and beer. They do carry Slivovitz. It's plum brandy from central Europe. Drink it for \"your health\" not the flavor and deal with the consequences ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent home cooking. I had the perch. Well prepped and seasoned. The fries were..fries. My companion had the pot roast and he raved. I'd go again. And try something a little more...adventurous."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday to see a friend play music. The place is just large enough to penalize half a hockey team for fighting, but you can tell it's not just a hole in the wall even though it is in fact a hole in the wall. The beer selection is above average and they have a menu with options that run deep but won't reach too deep in your wallet. I swung for the fences on this trip cardiovascular consequences be damed and got the cheesey burger oblivion I don't remember the name but it has everything on it but the kitchen sink. I am willing to bet you couldn't loose with any burger choice on the menu. My dining cohorts got the BBQ chicken breasts and a fish filet sandwich. Everything was affordable and delicious. Our service was attentive until traffic at the bar picked up after that it turned into a little bit of i DIY situation as my fiancee was asked to clear our glasses from the table and bring them to the bar. I got to meet Bob and he was a pretty cool guy. Without him we would have all been sober and hungry that night and that's just no fun. I would certainly recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Place is OK.  I know a lot of people from the East side come here.  Guess its from lack of other places?  I drove by it a million times and always seemed like my type of place.  Came here a few times now and last time was on a Sat afternoon on my way back West.  Bartender didnt know of any of the food specials (which were on their website) or she didnt wana hook a brotha up and save me some money.  Had mac n cheese bites and they were OK.  Just ball up some sticky mac n cheese in breadcrumbs and fry.  Not really reinventing the wheel.  The other food Ive had has been good bar food.  No problems there.  Beer selection is pretty good but I didnt see anyone drinking other than light, fizzy beer so who knows how long it sits on the shelf before you plop down your 4-5 dollars per beer?  Even with there only being 6 people or so we literally had to ask for everything...  silverware, more beer, check, etc..  Come for the food, but unless your a bigtime regular you get OK service.  Im still figuring out how the hell to actually say the name of the place too..."}
{"text":"This place is simply adorable.
Very old world. Fun fish fries. Amazing daily specials but get there early - they sell out as it's mostly all fresh home-cooked!!
Sadly this placed closed. :("}

A great neighborhood kitchen & bar on East 200th Street, yet with rather irregular & ever-changing hours... good luck finding them open!"}
