{"text":"Games selection is quite small and when I went there. They closed early, earlier than most Gameworsk places. This might be one of the quietest and less profitable GW out there since it's Las Vegas. If this was connected or inside a casino. It would be more convenient"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something new and different to do, you have to come here!! They have all types of arcade games for reasonable prices.   Upon entering, you load a Gameworks card which will cost you a one time $2 fee. Then, you can add points into the card. The deal I purchased was 120 points for $22.   On Tuesdays they have double ticket earnings which is a great deal! I enjoyed playing everything from ski ball to Mario kart to pinball and basketball. They offer so many classic arcade games for few points. Ski ball was only 2 points per turn so you can imagine how far your $22 go. Plus, you received so many tickets for playing that the prizes to choose from at the end were not just limited to candy."}
{"text":"We have 3 teenagers ages 18, 14 & 12.  We wanted to check it out and take the kids to do something fun before school started back up. We are locals and this was our 1st time going to Town Square and to Gameworks.   Loved Town Square. .I will have to do another review on that. We entered Gameworks from the bar/restaurant side.  The bar area is pretty big.  On the opposite side of the bar is a huge area for dining.  In fact i think that area is too big.  They should probably reduce the dining area by half to make room for more games. The gaming area was not what i expected it to be.  I mean they had some cool games but i thought the area would be much larger.  The computer gaming room was pretty cool.  My son wanted to play but we didn't get a chance.  It was only $5 an hour to play on the computer. ..next time we go I'll let my kids play in there.  There was a bowling alley in a separate room...we didn't go check it out tho. We didn't eat there this time around so I don't know how the food is. They could do with getting a few more shooter games as those are the kind of games my kids like.  We spent $54 on a play card with 400 credits which was enough for the 3 kids.  Next time we will spend a little more.  Overall this place is pretty cool.  My kids had fun and wanted to stay longer. On the next visit my husband and i will get some food and drinks while the kids go play."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with friends and it was awesome! The staff is friendly and very helpful especially KD :)  I would also like to thank Gameworks for donating to the local charity I work for, it is great to see that they are truly invested in their community. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"As others have said, most of the games here are driving games, and many of them were broken. Some of the games are just plain rip-offs as well, such as their virtual bowling simulator which has messed up sensors (throw the ball down the center and it detects it as a gutter??) or their $1.50/play Operation game which ended after 15 seconds with no warning.  With all that said, there are a couple of redeeming things about the place. Some of the arcade games are fun, and you'll have a lot to try if you like racing games. They also have pool tables, though again, many of them were out of order. Look in the free local discount books for some GameWorks coupons."}
{"text":"More like Games Don't Work.  Almost every game we played had an issue or the machine was completely out of service, was like an arcade in an apocalyptic world. Only plus was they serve beer, and even those aren't even cheap."}
{"text":"Parents usually dump me and sister here when they want to go gamble or have fun somewhere else.  Prices pretty decent, the time cards are really worth it if you plan on staying there that long. Just try not to share it because of the time restriction between each swipe. Great variety of games, plenty of things for a wide audience. I'm a heavy DDR/ITG Junkie and the Supernova there is in great condition. Because of the heavy flow of people going in and out, there's always somebody watching you play and complimenting (or criticizing :P).  Pretty good place, a few speed bumps here and there but nothing worth leaving early for."}
{"text":"Fun! The Thai Chicken Sandwich is really good. They have some old school games that brought back fun memories"}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I was so insulted and disrespected at a place. After telling the server there would be 2-3 more joining the 4 of us he walked to the back kicked the wall and yelled the f-word. So I asked him if it was a problem to take care of us he said no it was frustrating to take care of so many people and he was the only one there and blah blah blah. After talking to the manger who didn't seem to care we left. So much for enjoying my birthday with family and friends."}
{"text":"I love Gameworks!! I had my 10 year olds birthday party here and it was better than I could've ever expected! Our servers Jamie and Ron were very friendly and the games were a huge hit with all the kids! The bar area is a great area for the adults as well all staff (Sam and Andy) were so nice! I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I brought my son and couple of his friends here after for the first time after a movie. When I first walked in I must say it was an impressive sight. Lots of redemption games and the familiar cluster of noises reminded me of that an arcade is supposed to be.   But my son and his friends were more interested in the e-sports room, particularly in Mario Kart on the Wii U. When we found out they hold Mario Kart tournaments he was super excited. But concerned parents BEWARE!!!!!! These events along with many others are hosted by an outside person. So like any responsible parent I did a little research on this person who I will leave anonymous. Although I have had no interactions with this person personally, based on some of the vulgarity he posts on Twitter and watching some of his videos, I do not know how a large company like GameWorks could associate with such a person. He is not only unprofessional on his social media but also has no concern for censoring himself around younger people during hosted events it seems. My son was disappointed when I told him he could not attend any of these events but I feel it's my responsibility as a parent is to not allow him to come to these events based on the personality involved. Perhaps these events are geared more for \"adults\" then it shouldn't be kid games or GameWorks should do a little more research on who they have working for them."}
{"text":"Came here to check out the venue for a birthday party. However my experience wasn't so great. First off there was no changing table in the family restroom to change both of my sons diapers. Luckily I have my Phil & Teds stroller to convert into a changing table. second of all some of the games here are not well maintained. for instance the basketball hoops the staff does not ensure that each basketball hoops stall has basketballs. Most of the basketballs were gathered into one basketball stall. also the machines that are damaged keep taking the credits from the game card. Thus making it's an inconvenience in having to contact a staff member to reload the credits. I feel this place is not meant for toddlers as there are very little game choices for them."}
{"text":"Great for the whole family. Parents can relax at the bar, sports TVs galore, restaurant, and comfy couches. Bowling alley too. Hope they open one in Huntington Beach, Ca."}
{"text":"In my time I've never seen such a unorganized place. Games are always broken down, card readers have a serious issue of not reading or taking others credits. It's sad when a business like this isn't taking care of their own product. Food is great, the Servers are not. There are a select few servers that have their heads together and ones I do enjoy having around, some even go as far to make the guest feel like they are worth being there which I do Enjoy. Young Lady Sahara she is an outstanding server, Another Alonzo? If i remember right, went as far to make my child birthday a day to remember. None the less the place seems like a cesspool of drama. Bad when you hear the employees talking bad about one another calling each other vulgar names behind their back. that's just sickening and very unprofessional, even worse when the managers don't respond to any calls going out or giving you some BS excuse, Doesn't help looks like a few of them are under the influence of something. These are things that make me wonder why is this place still running or why haven't they got a change of people. You walk in the place, you can feel that there is something going on, Don't get me started on that Dark Ride game, That was just a huge mistake.  Will I be returning here, high chance I will not. Should others be cautious on what's going on there? Yes! Do understand this place is suppose to be family friendly, That place is by far not as \"Family Friendly\" as it seems. Please be aware when you walk into this place, if you have kids and wish to eat, please sit away from the booths. Filthy Mouths and Filthy Minds shouldn't be serving your family food."}
{"text":"Where to start...   I ordered a sandwich from their very limited lunch menu and when my food arrived it was not what I ordered and instead of fixing the situation, our server argued with me about how I ordered my sandwich. I'm sorry, but when I say chicken club that doesn't mean BLT on any planet.  The games situation... The space looks enormous, however looks can and in this case are deceiving. The assortment of games is very small and the ones that most patrons want to play are broken.   Beware of unruly, unsupervised children! I get it, it's an arcade-- that doesn't mean the Gameworks staff or other patrons are your babysitter."}
{"text":"So I hear on Thursdays Gameworks has a $10 play-all-night and $2 shots (and other misc. drink specials) from 9 to close.   http://www.gameworks.com/?tId=1&sId=14  Sweet! They have a DOCWE table, so I lugged my husband out and the kiddo (whose regular bedtime is midnight due to our schedules, so don't even go there). Get there at 8 and decide to pass the time by getting a bite. The waitress was sweet and lovely and made sure we were well taken care of.  So 9pm rolls around. I want to order a drink to take with me to the table. Why not. I have a designated driver and kid-taker-care-of-er and its been a long week so a drink or three sounds fab. \"The drink specials don't start until 10\" says the bartender. \"Thats not what the sign in front says.\" says I. Shrug. Drink specials don't start til 10. We at Gameworks like false advertisement.  So I order my $10 play all night card, and will be back at 10 for my drink. Get the card, obligatory $2 card fee.. and sit down at the DOCWE table. One race and the card stops working. We go WTF to the manager, and he says some games aren't available with the card. 1. We know, your sign says redemption games and a few others. DOCWE wasn't on that. Nor is it a redemption game. 2. The waitress said it was fine, way to make her look like a jerk. So we ask for a refund. \"You want a refund on a card you've already played on?\" after a few sarcastic remarks from my husband, we are told our transaction had been canceled.  We walked out the front door, disappointed and frazzled. We walked right past the sign that we had seen when we walked in... no mention of the DOCWE machine, and said drink specials started at 9.  For the record, we also heard several other people complaining about the sign. I took a picture of it, and if my phone cooperates, I'll post it here as well.   Melissa is right, it smelled pretty bad downstairs. I figured it was all the kids.. Dave and Busters doesn't stink.. and of course they will continue to get my business and the hundreds upon hundreds of dollars I sink into that damn DOCWE machine and happy hour beers."}
{"text":"Wow, would not have expected the meal we had to come from here.   Met Chef Tom outside and my friends and I decide to give it a try and what a great surprise. You need to spread the word.   Thanks Tom for the dip and great suggestions."}
{"text":"Came here to play some games with friends after walking around town square. Most of the games we tried to play didn't work/were broken. Such a disappointment after paying to play the games. If you have a specific game in mind, you might want to make sure its operational before you pay."}
{"text":"Video games and attractive bartenders, it's almost the equation for a perfect wet dream. They don't just have the run of the mill games either. The fact that MarioKart is up in there is worth 4 stars alone. Oh and if you get a shot of Patron here, which you better because this is Vegas, expect a gigantic shot because these ladies aren't selfish with their liquor. The only down side is that there are a couple kids in there and my adult ass would like to be in the company of other adults even though I'm socially awkward and won't talk to them anyway. Definitely a good spot to go to with the girlfriend or boyfriend (No judgements) just don't be in there drunk playing video games solo...it's slightly depressing lol! But hey...at least you're out of the house."}
{"text":"I had time to check this place out last night.  The four of us had dinner there and then enjoyed some games.  The service at dinner was great.  The server acknowledged they had only been open for about three weeks, and they were continuing to take any feedback to improve the experience.    The shareable crab cake was delicious, but the portion needs to be shipped off!  If you get it,  don't feel ashamed to be a bit greedy as the $14 cake is just that, one expensive cake!  HOWEVER,  the chicken nachos!  You can't go wrong!     The entrees were interesting.  I got the beef rib dish.  It's not something usual for me, but I took the server's advice (he was a good guy).  I found the meat to be a bit fatty.  I found enough tasty pieces to satisfy...  The most unsettling part of the dish was the way the meal was garnished.  Imagine the sword in the stone...  But it was the rib-bone jammed into the pile of wasabi mashed potatoes.  Different.  The beer selection was ok...  Just too expensive (I understand the place is on the strip).  I think I could have walked across the way to a competing place, and it would have been more affordable.  The game variety was fun (I stink at video games) ,and I enjoyed pinball.  The pacman air hockey will either make you pull a muscle or lose an eye!  It is not to be missed!    After speaking to a few staff members, it's clear they are working to adjust things.  I'll give them a few weeks and will try them again.    Be patient!  I think the place will compete for your attention soon!  Huge TV and video walls will be sure have your favorite sports games available.   Oh yeah, there is bowling and computer games there too (not sure what those are all about)."}
{"text":"It's hard to have a good first-time experience somewhere when it starts off terribly. We approached the host stand and waited for Destiny, the young hostess. This girl should not be the first person guests encounter when they walk in. She is completely tactless. She started every sentence \"Okay well...\"      \"Here is what's gunna happen...\"     \"yeah well...\"  Not to mention her constantly leaving the stand to talk in a huddle with her other rude coworkers who I over heard talking about how some new employee wouldn't last and would be gone within a week. So rude! Someone needs to remove her from that hostess stand immediately. I would write a review on everything else but who cares about anything else if the customer service stinks!?"}
{"text":"Went there for $10 game night on a thursday ....  Walked by so many time and this was my first time actually played in there.... for $10, all you can play , well, only limited to machine that do not give out ticket ....   Overall decent deal but then many of the machines are out of order .... :-(  And of what was not broken, 50% of them are racing game, 30% are shooting game and couple of dancing game which you can barely hear the music give it's so loud everywhere ....   The most fun is probably the karaoke box and the roller coaster ride simulator .... those 2 were fun, but if you were planning to do that, come on a thursday, otherwise it gets expensive.  For $10, it worth it though  Would be a better experience, if not so many machine were out of order"}
{"text":"My advice: count the # of Out of Order games before you buy a credit card! What arcade has 3 non functioning air hockey tables?! Everywhere we turned things were out of order so we spent our $10 on Dance Dance Revolution and basketball. The music on some DDR consoles was SO loud we couldn't hear our own song when someone was playing beside us and the number of tickets received from games seemed to be totally random (as there were 3 of us playing and the winner always got less than the others - huh?) Also not a fan of the $2.50 card activation fee...whiiich we had to buy at the service desk because surprise surprise the automated machine was broken. I've never been charged tax to add money to an arcade card before either. Have fun, mall shoppers. I have no desire to visit this place again."}
{"text":"Gameworks is one of the best places I have been to since moving to Vegas. Their eSports employees are all top knotch. When you go in, you're not a customer. You're a member of the team. Everyone has a blast! They host reat tournaments with beyond-fair prize support. As a former LAN-Center manager, I can tell you that this place gets a lot of things right. You can swing by and even watch some of the large tournaments. They recently hosted a Hearthstone Nats Qualifier, League of Legends LCS qualifier, and have nightly tournaments. Specifically, Veronica, Nancy, and Marlon are some of their all-stars. Their team is too fantastic to name them all, but I can not praise them enough. They have become my home away from home.  11/10"}
{"text":"If you like food that has no taste and is over priced, this is the place for you. The food was without a doubt the worst food I've ever had. We had a party of 4, one being a child and we didn't even eat half before we thought we was gonna be sick. Save your money, eat Raising Canes and then go to New York New York for the arcade."}
{"text":"This place was heaven when I was a kid. The crazy noises, the lights, the prizes. It was paradise. It's a little different now that I'm an adult (paying my own way), but it keeps bringing back those memories, as well as making plenty of new ones."}
{"text":"I hope they get back to how it was when they opened.  The selection of games is not anywhere of what it was and I really wish they had a better selection of the vintage games."}
{"text":"Opening day everything was broken. 2nd time I went nothing has changed. The esports lan center is too narrow And the byoc area is not that big and $5 and hour too expensive. Bar was ok and bowling area is too small. Maybe next time think about how you can improve."}
{"text":"Does management know who their target customer is?  What a disappointment!  Are they a bar or a game/entertainment center? One second they are catering to adults with drinks and low budget tv's and steps away they are catering to 5 year old children. The bar and arcade are a very weird mix in such a small space.  This is a classic example of a jack of all trades, master of none.  If this is a restaurant /bar, there are better ones 25 feet away and if this is an arcade for children, this is Las Vegas and Circus Circus runs circles around it. I expected that this was going to be a very cool, new and innovative arcade center for all ages and was really excited for something new and different to arrive but was disappointed to say the least and would never go back. I could improve this place with my eyes closed."}
{"text":"The game selection is not too bad. They have a lot of rhythm games, and they're handily bunched together in a room. Overall, though, the games are quite pricey, and certain machines keep breaking down. To be fair, I've put on an extra star for the games since I do find a good amount of them enjoyable. The customer service is deplorable, though.  I want to bring up a few points about the staff. These events have really soured my experience with this location. Normally when I go to Gameworks, I play a few games and everything is fine. However, on two occasions, the staff has been incredibly rude. One night, one of the staff yelled racial slurs at that group out of nowhere. We called upon his manager to get an apology, but the offender only claimed that it was an accident that he yelled out all those words. It was definitely no accident as he tailed our group to the outside of the building and shouted those words.  On a second occasion, after playing a few games with our group, my sister and I sat down and took a break at one of their tables for a few minutes. One of the employees came over and said they were watching us the entire time, and that if we did not play any games, they would ask us to leave the establishment. It is odd that they have been watching us, and it is odd because we HAD been playing games, albeit not as many as the others. I will note that we are Asian and post-college, but we dress and act like any other American women, so I have no idea why we were treated this way.  Despite all this, Gameworks can be a place for a fun outing depending on who is on staff at the moment. Unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning to this location again.  NOTE ADDED 5/15/13:  Below it seems like a representative of Gameworks offered a way to contact me in regards to my experience. In actuality, no follow up was offered. I emailed him shortly after he left that message, but I received no response in return, so my rating still stands."}
{"text":"Kareem is why I keep coming back. Hello,'I love you. Most fun and the best drinks I have had ever, ever! See you in a month for my sister's bachelorette party!!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced. We happened to be walking by and thought we'd take our niece inside to play some games. We bought the card with the credits before we noticed the price of the game. On average the games are 9 credits! 1 credit equals 1 quarter, so the games average $2.25! Never coming back again."}
{"text":"If i could submit no stars i would. First, the red headed or pink haired bartender needs to check herself. She showed no hospitality and failed to make an old fashioned cocktail. Barely any whiskey and served in a dirty soda glass. Also while i was trying to enjoy my terribly made drink i could overhear her speaking rudely about me to her coworkers. Girl needs to go."}
{"text":"Had my son's 12th birthday party here in February and I must admit, it was excellent service from management to our server who both really made the party a success. We all know when planning a child's party,  everything can go wrong!...really really fast, and it did everyone was wonderful even the bartender in the bowling alley. I promise you'd love this location well I did and would suggest it to anyone who wants to have a party here, or even just to hang out! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Honestly every time I go here the games are always broken and take my credits. It makes me sad. I also feel that the games take way too many credits to play especially for them to be broken. I always think \"hey lets go to gameworks\" and then I realize how bad it is everytime hahaha. Granted I hate chuck e cheese but it's way better as far as games go it also feels more liberating with actual tickets in your hand. I do prefer the people at gameworks VS chuck e cheese because it's flooded with little kids. Anyways Gameworks is ok... I guess lol"}
{"text":"we got the all day passes that they had on groupon and decided to go on sunday.  it wasn't crowded at all, however i was kinda let down by the choice of the games.  a lot of the games were down for maintenance  or they were broken, and the games there were open there were just too many of the same games.  they had like 5 different house of the dead games and multiples of other games like that, and then a bunch of driving games.  i would have given it 2 stars, but we went up to the bar area by the food part and ended up playing pool for free, and they had skeeball that you can use the all day passes on so that was nice as the other skee ball machines do not let you as you win tickets with them.  the bartender was really nice and she ended up letting us play pool for free since we were buying drinks.  that made the rest of the afternoon for us till we drunkenly wandered over wicked spoon (see my review for there)  i dont think i would be back here as i just didn't have a good time and everyone in our group was bored after about an hour"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere and plenty of games to play.  The food is okay and everyone who works here are friendly and helpful.  A great time was had by all."}
{"text":"I write this because I actually care about this place. Gameworks opened in 1997. I was actually part of the opening crew. I only worked there about 6 months but I loved it so much I would make it my weekly haunt for several years.  At that time Gameworks kept up with the gaming market which of course has gone down severely since console and computer gaming has become more popular. However, Gameworks was never a game room or an arcade. For the first year that it was opened you could have money deducted from your paycheck if you referred to Gameworks as either one of those in the presence of a manager. Gameworks was an experience. It's originating concept was what would happen if a bunch of 90's tweens were to find an old abandoned building that was powered by \"Surge\" soda. The magical new super caffeinated mountain dew alternative for tweens living the extreme.    The credit system they used was supposed to be easy on parents and tweens alike. Mom or Dad could buy a card that could be used in every part of Gameworks excluding the bar. That way a kid didn't have to carry around actual money and could play games, get a burger and fries, drink some SURGE!!!! ect.ect.  Video games had cup holders and fries were served in cups so kids could snack as they played.   Upstairs there was a coffee bar, a regular bar, and a full restaurant. They had leather couches and chairs in parts of the bar and coffee bar. They had an area for retro 80's games. Most importantly they had two special attractions known as Vertical Reality and the INDY 500. In the middle of the upstairs they had a professional sound and video board with some of the latest equipment available at the time. They had actual DJ's that were called Play Jockeys controlling video and audio feeds to the 5 different quadrants of the building. During the initial year of opening I witnessed lines outside the door of people trying to get in the door . They had over a thousand people riding the indy 500 hundred  each week during the summer. They had contest with great prizes like Superbowl tickets, Harley Davidson, and one Halloween they gave away a stand up House of the Dead arcade game.   Now the decline- Every company has a vision and talking points that they pass off as their do's and don'ts. Gameworks always wanted  to have staff available to assist people. The first notice of decline of course was under staffing. No longer were people greeting others, giving them a random free play on the games. Instead of running multiple lines of Vertical reality which had multiple bays they would only keep open one or two.  Instead of having announcers always stationed at indy 500 a sign was put in place that said see attendant for assistance.  Secondly the one golden rule they swore they would never, ever, ever, EVER BREAK... Gameworks will never have redemption games. Tickets were considered evil, instead they had a gift shop where you could buy things like shirts, shot glasses, and all kinds of other crap you could possibly find as prizes at other places.  They day I walked in and saw the first game spitting tickets and the words redemption, I felt I was kicked in the nuts. The final straw would be the multiple changes to the bar. Certain liquors, beers, ect were gone. Certain specialty drinks gone. Great bartenders gone. Happy hour host and play jockey's gone. The music is now a loop, the play Jockey audio and visual station is not used. Last time I was in there the bartenders were using jigs, had no flair, and most importantly were more concerned with trying to  get the one girl who was in the bar to talk to them instead of making money by serving drinks, up selling, and keeping conversation with multiple patrons. Gone was the once warm inviting atmosphere, and instead I felt like I was having a drink poured for me by a 21 year old holding a liquor bottle for the first time.   At this point the once great establishment that I have spent thousands of dollars at between 97 and 2007 has become a poor depressing shell of what it once was. You could actually close the bar, get rid of the restaurant and put a pizza place upstairs and they could probably pull off a chucky cheese gig and be more profitable then what they appear to me.   Opportunities for improvement- It is my firm belief that Gameworks has the chance to reinvent themselves if they would try a radical approach . At this time they have at least 3 or 4 great spaces that they could potentially use for LAN gaming and console gaming. It would very easy to set up multiple consoles and a internal LAN and do a pay for the hour or day thing. Much like Howie's game shack in mesa riverview. They also need to go back to the night club ambiance after 8pm. Bring back the play jockeys and the hostesses. Bring back that feeling of warmth.   Update as of  7/21/13 Attraction rides have been taken out. Many of the non-redemption games looked in horrible shape. Seemed like nothing but driving and redemption games. #Sad -1 star"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Gameworks for the eat and play combo. To say the least; we were not impressed. The customer service was so-so. The restaurant was mostly empty when we walked in but our waitress still gave the impression that our simple order was difficult and was less than friendly throughout the meal. The food was the only saving grace and even that left something to be desired. After finishing the meal we walked down to the games only to find the majority of games the eat and play combo allowed were out of order. (The one or two hour pass can not be used to play games that give tickets or prizes) I would recommend paying a bit more and going to Dave and Buster's if your in the mood for this type of establishment."}
{"text":"This was my second trip to Gameworks and, although I still had a great time, the hubris of 2 hours of all-you-can-play video games seems to have worn off a bit and I experienced a few more hiccups this time around.    First, I have always done the \"Play 2 hours for $25\" deal, which doesn't include some of the \"attractions\" like the rock climbing wall.  For 2 hours I think that I get $25 worth of fun.  If you're really wanting to blow a day here, they have all day passes for $35.   The game selection is good, for the most part.  They have an alley of classic retro games along with the normal slew of shooters (House of the Dead series seems to be big since they have HotD 2-4) and racing games.  You can also play air hockey and mini-basketball.  The problem I found is that, especially during peak times, all the players migrate to the newest, coolest games so you might be stuck playing Deer Hunter the entire night.  Still, there is a good selection so I'm sure that you can find something you like while you wait it out to play the latest and greatest.  Definitely survey the scene before you commit your dough.  There were a couple problems I encountered which diminished my experience.  First, there were a decent number of out-of-order games, one that even went on the fritz while I was playing it so I had to stop.  That's annoying, especially if it's one of the more popular games.  Second, the swipe cards that they give you to use for your unlimited play seem to be reaaaaaaally picky.  Have you ever had a friend who is 5' 5\" and swears that he'll never date anyone shorter than him who likes cats and won't wear blue and isn't a brunette and won't go with him to strip shows and smokes and hasn't voted in the last 4 gubernatorial elections and is between the ages of 22-25?  That's what these cards are like.  There is nothing more annoying than being \"on the clock\" trying to eff up Darth Vader's poo and have your card suddenly not be readable by the video game.  If it doesn't work within 10 seconds you have to start from the beginning, which drives me nuts.  When we asked one of the employees about it he was really nice and coached us on how to use them but we still experienced quite a few problems.  I'm one of those guys who likes to finish video games so this was a huge deal for me.  UGH.  The third problem is that I got a blister from playing House of the Dead 4.  That was not Gameworks fault  though; maybe I just have tender hands?  In any case, cool game.  Zombies, meet the wrath of my UZI!    I would recommend checking this place out if you are into video games.  Do the math and figure out whether an unlimited play or debit card is right for you.  Without the pressure of \"the clock\" and getting your money's worth, some of the problems I mentioned might be avoided.  Also, try out the climbing wall, it's pretty fun (I climbed to the top).    If nothing else, think of it this way:  at least those are 2 hours that you spent not playing the dollar slots so you actually made money!"}
{"text":"Wow. I thought I'd been to a Gameworks before, but this isn't the place I remember. Puts Dave & Busters to shame. Shame, brother. Hung out for a couple hours there this afternoon with my lil bro and man, we had a blast. Price-wise you can't beat the 2 hour unlimited play for $15 we hit. Don't think that's available all the time, but it was today. Score.  Service was actually really good too - what kind of service do you really need at an arcade? Well, not having been in one quite like this, it was kind of nice to have someone patiently explain the swipe card system (no pockets full of quarters anymore), not to mention the layout of the place (which is huge - two floors!).   The selection's incredible - everything from your typical racing games, shooting games and fighting games to basketball and skee ball and air hockey - there's even stuff I've never seen before, like a Karoake booth and jumping games (?) and roller coaster simulators. And as one reviewer mentioned, there are several that even require a seatbelt. A seatbelt. Sweet."}
{"text":"great arcade and nice for the kids to get their wiggles out, they can be loud and play and its okay cause its an arcade we spent about $60 and that meant each kid got a card with $10 each and they all had a blast if you are in las vegas you have to stop here and let the kids play my nephew who is 6 won 1000 tickets on the big spin and was stoked and my neices loved the deal or no deal game"}
{"text":"1 pizza,nachos and 4 drinks...$72! Are you kidding me? The pizza was like the stuff you get in school. Hard cheese and grease floating on top. The service in the restaurant area sucked. I stood by the host table not sure if we ordered there or waited to be seated. All the while,some 16 yr old staring at me not saying one word. Finally I attempt to order and was told I need a table first. Ok cool,but you seen me standing here for 5 min and didn't say a word! Kids eventually had fun on the games you could play (half of them were down). Don't think I'll take the family back anytime soon. Hopefully Dave and Busters is better!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!!!!!! Went to go for a good friends birthday party. Sat there waiting to get water for my family for an hour. Twice asked the waitress if she can get us a pitcher of water. And not once but TWICE she refillwd water for tables AROUND us. My kids were dying of thirst after ridiculously waiting for another 20 minutes. Finally walked up to the manger just to see if we get any service. When they finally acknowledge us they just handed my wife a pitcher as if she was one of the workers and walked away. Workers here have really bad attitude. No one smiles here and no one is ever accommodating. Never in my life will i ever come back. Worse experience ever!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my favorite diversion activity in vegas. It was a fun place and of course it is closed like all other good things in las vegas. That is why vegas sucks these days."}
{"text":"The new town square location is convenient. I came for Sunday football and met up with some friends, some of whom have children.  Each game was prominently displayed. There are not only big flat screens but projector tv's as well. Plus, audio for one game was playing.   The food was typical bar food with wings, fish and chips, salads, calamari, works fries, and overloaded nachos. The portions are also fairly generous. Though there are seemingly more up scale dinners as well like steak or salmon. While I didn't try the attempts at finer food, I question the logic and quality of the ingredients of an arcade which may see someone order salmon once a week.  There's enough to keep the kids entertained so long as it's not busy. The size of the building is comparable to other chains like Dave and Buster's thanks to the bowling alley and private rooms. The designers made an oversized dining and tv watching area that doesn't fit with the number of game machines. If the dining room were packed with parents, the lines for games would be three kids deep. That is to say, there aren't enough game machines if business picks up.  As far as the bar, they do have about ten things on tap including Angry Orchard, Stella, and Sam Adams. I did find it annoying that every time is came back to the bar and the same bartender, she had to check my id. I'm a huge hipster in a hat and bright pink and blue shirt memorable enough for the bar flys to remember what team I was cheering for. I will say on behalf of a few of the girls: avoid the mixed drinks because they're poorly proportioned with too much syrup and for one mojito which was made with gin instead of rum, just wrong.  I cannot speak to the bowling or the LAN/internet gaming, but the former was empty and the later seemed packed."}
{"text":"This was the latest of several trips here with our 3 boys while visiting Vegas. Again it was great entertainment for the kids. However I was frustrated by the many machines that were not working at all or in desperate need of repair. I was recently at a Dave and Busters where the games were newer and in better shape. Still a nice off Strip option for kids, but I hope the games are updated and repaired soon."}
{"text":"I have to admit.. I'm a huge critic on servers reason being because I serve tables and train them also.. ebony blew me away with her outgoing and friendly personality when I asked her about things on the menu . She made my kids laugh and when I asked for something with no hesitation she was on it. This is the type of sever we need in vegas.. the ones that make you feel welcome to be there. I will most definitely be back.. thank you so much ebony.."}
{"text":"I feel kind of bad for giving this establishment two stars but I really feel like the place has gone downhill compared to the past.  I used to like a lot of the games here; Taiko Drum Master (a drumming music game), an authentic Japanese photo booth, the UFO catcher machines you would normally see only in Japan...they're all gone now. I'm not sure if this is because Gameworks parted with Sega but a lot of the really cool things have been replaced by generic token-eating machines.  My boyfriend and I are avid rhythm game fans but were seriously disappointed with how they treat their machines. Two of the Dance Dance Revolution games have broken first-player pads, which essentially makes them useless and the drum game they replaced Taiko with has a broken stick. When we gave up playing those games for a bit and went play others:  a) A good number of games were out of order b) Our tokens were jammed three times in three separate machines c) Tickets were not refilled in some of the machines d) A button was broken on their prize machines (the ones you hit a button to win a prize) so we had to call the manager over to fix the situation.  We had to ask an employee working to help us multiple times and it was obvious she was getting fed up. That made ME fed up because she was standing around the rest of the time talking to her coworker.  The only redeeming thing during this trip was that it was happy-hour so all games were half-price. The games are overpriced anyway so it made the trip a little more bearable. I've been here multiple times in the past and normally I would come back in a heartbeat but now I'm hesitant. Gameworks really needs to step up their game and stop getting rid of everything that once made them special."}
{"text":"40% of games were out of order...on their first Saturday?  Trying to redeem card points is awkward at best. You walk into their retail room and hopefully someone will ask you if you want to see what you can get!  We had to ask to find out how many points we had.  Redemption is fair, at best. Games aren't great, most don't work.  Restaurant is large and expensive.  Pretty disappointing in comparison to the Gameworks we had on The Strip."}
{"text":"2 Star rating on average? Seems about right. I've been to the old gameworks on the strip, which was pretty old and dank, but was two stories. I don't see them having enough business to pay for the strip's rent, so I understand.  Moving to the Town Square is a great move.   Pros:   - Love that they were open until midnight. Went to a movie at 10:45 and wanted to kill time before. -It was pretty fun  -The prizes really are better than most places (keep in mind, most prizes are for kids, and kids love these weird prizes) -Bowling looked pretty cool, didn't see prices though  New ticket system could be seen as pro or con. All tickets go back on the card  Cons:  -NOTHING FREAKING WORKS. I mean seriously. You just opened. There is about 7 basketball games, only two worked. -Operator didn't work (wish I could play that) -2 wheel spinning games didn't work -Spaceballs worked and then would flash out of order, then work again. -Tetris style game didn't work -A couple of games ate our game card points and didn't work -A few more games didn't work.  A total of about 1/3 of the games didn't work which is pretty lame since it is really busy in there.  -It definitely should be bigger with more games. -The gameperks doesn't work here because \"their system isn't synced\" -They are very very slow. Workers took a long time to load points on the cards, one time was out of printer paper and wouldn't let people buy cards for about 20 minutes. -VIP members have different credit pricing but we can't get the VIP member pricing?  We spent quite a bit of money here for a birthday. About $130 and got about 8,000 tickets (which are all kept on the card) Used 3200 for a giant lego pillow (cooler prizes than most places) Don't know if we will be back"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place a 3 because the selection of games has significantly decreased since it's movement from the Las Vegas strip.   I still however love the environment. It reminds me more of a \"Dave and Buster's\" establishment with a bar and restaurant available right inside. You're able to reserve for parties which makes it perfect for groups and birthdays. If you're a hard core gamer this might not be the arcade for you since the selection of games is limited. But if your just here for fun family and games it'll be experience for you and whomever you want to bring.   Service is really top notch as always. So make sure to enjoy your time here : )  My review is more for the arcade portion of this establishment.  everything else gets a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"Gameworks was really fun.  I love the Outrun driving game."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, I didn't see OUT OF ORDER signs on any machines.  But the cost of playing kept my visit short."}
{"text":"First.. Seems like a fun place to hang out.. they have a pool table, bar, and restaurant upstairs.  Downstairs is lots of games, which i didnt play.  I am getting really upset with these big restaurants that think its ok to sell frozen food!  Un believable.  The food was not seasoned.  Literally no seasoning.  Not great food.. I didn't even take the leftovers for the dog.  The three stars are for the atmosphere and games :)"}
{"text":"I've been here about 20 times :)  A tip for locals, the best place to park is MGM self parking off of Tropicana, and just make your way through MGM past the lions and out onto the strip.  Gameworks is just past all the people in costumes and M&M world.  There's a sign for Glacier Bar, that bar is attached to the inside of Gameworks.  I'll start with the bad :  - Some of the games break, it's to be expected with all the kids running through there.  - Over-priced weak alcohol.  - Pay per hour system, just don't do it.  Go for the points!  Now the good stuff:  - A rarity in America, customers always come first here!  If you have ANY problems with ANY games the staff will comp you those points and more, and are very friendly about it.  The only time they weren't friendly I talked to the manager and that kid got fired on the spot.  - Same goes for the weak drinks, tell the barkeep about it and it's fixed no problems!  - The food is surprisingly cheap and awesome, I would say on par with Red Robin.  Much much more than you'd expect for an arcade.  - Loads and loads of games for everybody, more than you'll be able to play in one visit for sure.  - Points system!  I load up a card for $54 (sounds expensive right!) and it comes with 400 points.  $22=120p / $27=190p / $37=260p / $54=400.  The average game costs 2-4 points, the highest is 8.  I'll use the same card for multiple visits.  If you have multiple people load up one card and pass it around.  - It's probably the ONLY place on the strip where you can stay entertained the whole day for well under $100."}
{"text":"This Gameworks is awesome there's great games food bowling pool and even esports where you can play PC games and console games and a pretty good selection of prizes you can buy with points or what they call tickets and all the employees iv meet have been super nice and helpful for the most part.  I'm glad that Las Vegas is putting money back into places for kids and teens to enjoy and not just for adults.   It's at a really easy location to get to and away from the busy hassle of the strip.  The old Gameworks on the strip was a great place but let's get real it was dying and had to be updated. I understand people's complaints about waiting and the lack of games but it's 2014 and we have to be realistic.   And if your gonna be one of those people to complain about oh the lack of games cry about it.. I bet you only went to the old game works once or twice a year. If your going to be stuck up about it go try and find some where else with all the awesomeness build in one place.. And when you do please let me know..   But till then Long Live Gameworks!  - Bart Sampson"}
{"text":"First time checking out gameworks new location.  And it was awesome.  Love the set up.  Lots of T.V.s. Sports bar feel with video games.  Whats not to love.  Played almost every game in the place with there unlimited hour game card.  Really fun games.  Lots of choices.  Dark escape 4D is by far the tightest game there.   I could play that for hours.   The food I thought was average bar food.  Had the buffalo wings.  Nice size wings, perfectly cooked crispy yet juicy inside.  Could of been a little spicier and saucier.  But still really good. Would order again.   Wasn't sure how it would be with all the negative reviews.  But I'll be back for sure.  Cool place to catch a NBA game.  Have a few drinks,  do a little gaming."}
{"text":"This place is great, good food, and great service...jarred was our server and was great, it was our first time and he gave us a good run down of the food and their specials...very fast service the food was hot and fresh.i would definitely come back..good place to spend quality time with the family"}
{"text":"Great deal if........All the games worked also a lot of outdated older machines made it disappointed.   Need to step up game because food and games are better at Dave and Busters.  Sorry Gameworks but thought I should know"}
{"text":"I had lots of fun here And I truly felt like a kid again! The things that bugged me is that it is very pricey and the tickets compared to the prizes is very expensive! Something I can purchase at the store for maybe $10 cost 1000 tickets or maybe $50 of hard work gaining the tickets. So with that being said if you are in it for the fun and ready to spend lots of money then have at it! The service though was great!"}
{"text":"The best game there was finding the machines that worked.  I signed up just to make this review.  I'm visiting the pheonix area from out of state.  My fiance and I wanted to have a fun night out and decided to give gameworks a try.  Holy mother... it was a tragic joke. LITERALLY 50% of the machines were out of order or turned off.  The other half were, of the majority, malfunctioning or not accepting card swipes.  We spent 50 bucks to charge the card (plus a \"fee\" or \"tax\" or something). It was a task to find machines that worked to spend the full amount.  We ended up giving our card, still charged with hundreds of credits, away to a child before we left.  We'll never be back and we'll tell everyone that visits the area about our rediculous experience.  Management, get your shit together."}
{"text":"I came here with my family on a Saturday. Great place for kids and adults to have a little bit of fun. The staff was friendly and efficient. Also One of the managers Ron was very polite and even went out of his way to make sure we were taken care of. Food was good and there was a great vibe to the place. Definitely a place for all ages"}
{"text":"These idiots were closed today for a private event. Really annoying since we came a very long way."}
{"text":"It's a pretty nice arcade with a good number of choices. The card swiping made everything pretty convenient. I would say this is the largest and probably best arcade in Vegas."}
{"text":"We have been here numerous times over the years and it has always been a fun place to spend with the family. After the thousandth trip, we figured that in order to redeem a reward worth redeeming like a console, to save up our thousands of tickets instead on the card we had. Today, after using the card numerous times to play a myriad of games and cash out coins, we decided to put more money in just to have one of the cashiers tell us out card no longer 'works' and we will have to transfer to a new card. When we got more than three thousand tickets today, we asked about our other balance to be told we don't have any other tickets, and there's nothing they could do about it. They said if we had registered our card, maybe they could do something about it. I had assumed the 'transfer' would indeed transfer everything, instead, they lost everything and just gave us a new card instead. After we get as much as we can off the card, I am not going to return here again. What a terrible way to lose money."}
{"text":"let's just say this place is shit. 20 for the groupon is sadly over-priced. of course you can only play non prize and non ticket games, which I understand.. but every other game which you can play is broken and if not it was very close to... I remember this place being super awesome as a kid and now it is a joke. castles n coasters can hold up against this arcade which is a very sad statement.. I was pretty bummed that I wasted the money on this and will never return. :("}
{"text":"You need more new games, and some of the game cost alot of credit for 1 play......"}
{"text":"Samantha Birsen was amazing getting my wedding reception all set up for me and our waitress was also amazing. Food was good. we had pizza it was really good we had thirty people. six pizzas was plenty of food along with party trays of cheese fruit and salad. Samantha went out of her way to make sure I had my wedding cake from a bakery and even picked it up for me. It couldn't of been a better day. Cheese was good fruit was good and games were fun. I'm not hard to please but was beyond amazed."}
{"text":"What does it say about me that when I go to Vegas I most look forward to this place, and that when I leave Vegas the fondest memories I have are of this place?  On a completely unrelated topic, why can't I get laid?"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Waited 30 minutes after finishing the meal and never got the check. Server did not come back to refill drinks . Did not bring requested items several times . Still had to wait and the entire party got up and walked to the front of the restaurant because the manager never came out to the table. Would never eat here again or recommend it to anybody. Food was also substandard, tasted only mildly better than gas station prepared food and was far more expensive. After everything was said and done the only concession given was a 20% reduction on the check as well as a card for games in the arcade which didn't work in half the machines because the readers on the arcade games were faulty, it would take several tries to get the card to read on many of the machines if we could get it to read at all."}
{"text":"I've fequented here often enough to know that all the majority of the games here are all those ticket games and little claw type games. I come to hang out with friends and play some games. I can in on tuesday night around 6pm and thought to have dinner there since I had a coupon for the place. I really didn't care about price at the time with the coupon.   After being seated our waitress got our drinks took our order and everything was fine. After we recieved the food we were left unattended for quite some time. When the waitress finally returned I had to ask for a refill and some ketchup as well. My drink was empty so I would assume that would be something that the waitress would ask but I caught her before she left. My boyfriend did not recieve a single refill the entire night and we were there from 6pm to 9pm.  We had friends meet us there and we just chatted it up for some time. It wasn't for some time that we realised that the place was bare not just of customers but of staff as well. It was as if they closed the place down and just left us. After the waitress had taken our check and cashed us out that was the last we saw of her. The plates of our food were still in front us the entire time and we had kind of placed them all together so that she could come and just take them...kind of thought that the bunch of plates stacked together would give the hint we were done but I guess I shouldn't be so subtle next time.   The food was ok at best. Nothing bad nothing good in hind sight though if I had to pay full price for what I got if that waitress had left us like she did and I didn't frequent the games I would've walked out. Probably wouldn't notice.   All in all go for the games if anything else. The games are even ok that is IF they are running. Sometimes I come in and games are off or not working. This is just a place that is convienent for myself and friends to meet up."}
{"text":"Poor management. its manged by a out of time redneck woman who is backwards and uneducated about business. they did not cater to our need and our situation twice. we were a family with a 95 year old woman. we had to drop her off at the front because she cant walk very far. she gets tired walking from the living room to the kitchen. So we were sitting in the esports couch area and we were told to leave the area. I was a little annoyed but understandable. i asked the assistant manager to find a place for her to sit. he was an excellent manager. i forgot their names but the assistant helped us. hes a middle eastern/asian looking. skinny good looking guy. he took us to an vacant room for us and it was really nice. then the main manager who looks like a typical redneck trash who told us to leave because we brought food from home. we understood but we were willing to spend money to cater her very need. but she would not let us. so we had to walk across the store again back to the car. We were here before and they just lost their regular customers. Fire the main manager and promote the assistant.   p.s. they made a 95 year old woman walk all over the store. if something happened.... i know you dont care about her but think about your job. if something happened to her..... your going to get sued. and were from los angeles. we sue."}
{"text":"This one of the places to go if you have kids. I took my son last year for his birthday. We went with two of our family members. They are kinda pricey, but it was well worth it. Seeing the smile on my son's face... oh yeah. He loved it. Especially knowing that he loves video games.. it all worked out. I think I spent close to $300 in one day for four people, but at least we had a blast. I would have to say that if you have kids, go there."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went last night for date night. I had fun but was very upset at the fact I spent a good chunk of my money on games that didn't work properly or just didn't work at all. Drink we're good and the XD ride was my favorite part!"}
{"text":"Just got back from Gameworks and was disgusted by the lack of service, rude waiting staff complaining that they were busy .. Even with an empty bar and only one other table than me and my boyfriend sat at the bar.  We decided to come here for a beer before going to see a movie. Since my boyfriend didn't eat dinner and I was peckish we decided to get the sampler.. Now at $18 dollars I was expecting a very hefty amount of food for us to share... I was so wrong ! For 18 dollars we received 3 mozzarella sticks 2 potato skins 3 tiny wings and 5 stale tortilla chips and it was so bad , the waitress gave us beer in plastic glasses because she had no clean talk ones (in an empty bar?) but still charged us for a tall.  Our bill came to over 40 dollars !!!! and I had one beer and a couple of stale tortilla chips, we had to go eat dinner afterwards instead of watching a movie...  Appalling and will not return."}
{"text":"Some of the games can get pricey, but it's a great treat for kids off all ages, young to old. Enjoy the fact that the adults are able to relax with an adult beverage, there is a bowling alley & restaurant. I've been here twice, taking the same 9 year old and we had a blast over his Christmas break."}
{"text":"Not even worth your time. The first 5 games we tried had something missing, broken or was out of order. I seriously have never been so disappointed. Never again."}
{"text":"Absolutely f-ing terrible! We brought our daughter here on 5-13 to have a great night. We walked in and it looked great, Until we bought our game cards. After that it was all downhill. All of the working games are overpriced, the other half are all broken. Even the ones that WERE working, were either missing pieces or had gang names carved into the screens... The seats to sit on were either cut open or falling off. I needed assistance with a game so I asked the shaggy haired fellow from the prize room to help me. He couldn't care any less and was absolutely no help. If you are looking to have a good time with your family or friends just take all the money that you would have literally wasted in there, go out behind the dumpsters and wait to be robbed at gun point. The experience will be more entertaining and surely your hard earned money Will be better spent that way rather than on that smelly run-down dump they call \"gameworks\"  Conclusion: Gameworks sucks. -5 stars! You couldn't pay me to go back!"}
{"text":"This is long overdue, but I can't tell you how pleased I was with the service inside the esports area. It was our first time and how eager we are to go back! You have the option of $5/hr or $20 for 5 hours and you don't have to use it all at once. Save your credit for a rainy day. The young men working there are extremely fun, knowledgeable and attentive! We also ordered food and drinks.  We couldn't get enough of the amazing Mac n Chz Balls!!! And the attendants were so kind in refilling our sodas. I couldn't ask for more. My son said it was the best day ever! Thanks guys for an outstanding job!!! :)"}
{"text":"We had our 6 year olds birthday party here. The party room, host and food was excellent. The birthday party included an hour of free game play for the kids. The party room had TV's on with sports as well as music. Our experience was excellent!"}
{"text":"Ok, went here with a Groupon.  $20 for 10 hours of play.  Seriously almost half the video machines are out of order, have no sound, or are so uncalibrated as to be worthless.  Stopped to get food and there was one waitress for the entire dining room.  After waiting 15 minutes we went elsewhere to eat.    Do yourself a favor and go to Dave & Buster's instead.  Much nicer interior and better games and service."}
{"text":"Had a great time playing games and the staff in the front is friendly, then came time for my family to get dinner at the Gameworks restaurant. We went over and the first employee we saw just stood there and looked at us before pretending she didn't see us, so I asked if we were supposed to seat ourselves. She said no, that we would be seated by \"them\". She actually walked us around the corner to where someone would take us to a table and give us menus, only she stood there talking to the two people who were there for a while. One of the other people finally looked over and asked if we wanted a table, we said yes and she said \"oh\". Then she went back to what she'd been doing when we first showed up. Finally, she got us some menus and took us to our table, where we sat and waited a while for someone to come over just to get drink orders. It wasn't even busy there, maybe four tables with patrons and they had a staff of at least six, not counting the kitchen. Just some side notes; the table they sat us at was not clean, it took forever for someone to take out order, the order was mixed up a bit by the server, and it took a while to get our bill. The food was pretty decent, but the service sucked. When we left, we got some dirty looks from the staff members we'd  had interaction with, probably because I didn't feel compelled to leave extra money for the awful service. Instead, I left a note kindly asking them to improve their service. It was the best tip I could give them, since I've worked in customer service most of my adult life."}
{"text":"Used the Groupon's for family members was the best choice to kill a day we didn't have much planned. It was worth it. Friendly staff and food was surprisingly good. Little on the higher priced side of food and drinks, but it was convenient. Good games options all around. Total spent was $150 for all day play. $20 each Groupon x 5 = $100 and $50 bucks on two appetizers and drinks."}
{"text":"Took my grandson for his 7th birthday. The 5 year old was also with us. Lots of games, including a room full of computers, with XBox and Playstation set-ups. The rollercoaster simulator was really fun. The restaurant and bar had friendly staff members. Typical bar food, but it was ok. You can walk around the whole place with your beer or cocktail. I don't think they need such a large dining area."}
{"text":"We had our company Holiday party here on a Saturday. Gameworks manager Ron Arenas helped us arrange the party! He was super accommodating to our needs and made the process very smooth! Our section was reserved and the food came out at the time we requested. It was very delicious too! I have lived here for some years and this was the first time I have been here.  My kids had a blast running around playing while I socialized with my co-workers. Had a great time! Thank you so much Ron for helping us to have a wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"A vast array of broken games, lackluster service and toilets you can LITERALLY smell from more than twenty feet away make this a terrible destination.  Don't waste your money or time.  Incidentally, I am an avid gamer and used to just LOVE this place.  It saddens me that it's fallen into such hard times."}
{"text":"PRO: Fun place to take the kids... in the middle of a massive mall, or outlet, however you want to see it.   CON: Horrible customer service. You'd better go into this place, knowing what to do, and how to do it. Don't ask anyone any questions.. at all. When in doubt, walk out with your head down. EXIT."}
{"text":"I just went last night, after not going since shortly after they opened. This place is pitiful! Many games don't work, and a lot of the seats on the ones that do are disgusting. There are literally huge holes in the seats, where you can see all the filthy foam inside. Less than half of the basketball games were on, and there were only 3 balls in each, so you waste a lot of time waiting for the balls to be returned. A lot of the 2-player shooting games are missing one gun,so you can't play them together.   They finally  got a dark ride, and I have always loved that attraction. It's fun, but too short. I'm glad I got to try it here while it's still new, before it looks like the rest of the building.   I'm not sure how this place went down hill so fast, but it looks depressing in there, and it's pretty gross. I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"WORST ARCADE IVE EVER BEEN TOO. WORST BARTENDER CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. AND ALL OF IT HAPPENED ON CHRISTMAS DAY.  First off, I went with my gf on xmas to kill some time and I shit u not, we couldnt find a single machine that wasnt broken one way or another. the shooting games only one side worked properly and the vr game the door wouldnt shut completely constantly opening and slamming ending up with a tear in my gfs cloths.  it doesnt stop there....then we gave up on trying to enjoy their dog shit arcade so we went to drink and the bartender seemed like he hated his life and never asked us if we needed anything. constantly had to wave him down. it was not busy AT ALL on xmas at this shithole excuse of an arcade.  DO NOT GO HERE. ITS THE REMNANTS OF WHAT USED TO BE A GOOD ARCADE WHEN THEY WERE LOCATED ON THE STRIP!!!"}
{"text":"We always hit up gameworks for hours of fun when we come to Vegas. We are obsessed with the Wizard of Oz game and my kids also love the Pac Man Air Hockey game! The food is good too but we usually spend all of our time playing the games. The staff are always friendly and have helped with anything we need. My daughter loves that the restrooms are always so clean. Great for kids, teens and adults."}
{"text":"Bad bad bad bad. I grew up near the Seattle Gameworks. One of my favorite spots. Good food, great venue, great service, great arcade.    The new Townsquare GameWorks is none of those things. This location is an offense to the reputation they've built.  Food: 0/5. It didn't get my sick. That's the absolute best thing I can say about it. The Nachos and Pizza were far, far worse than 7/11. Yes, the pizza you get at 7/11 is leaps and bounds better than what's served at the Town Square GW. The Nachos were better in Middle School. No, I'm not exaggerating. It's edible  Service: despite half the restaurant being empty, the server informed us it would be a 20 minute wait. When I pointed out that fact that 2/3 of the restaurant was empty, she told me she was short of servers and just couldn't do it(I've worked in two high end restaurants in my life, and that is pure comedy.) There was one large party, and five other tables. I saw a minimum of five servers. There was enough staff to cover a 50 table restaurant and they made us wait so the servers wouldn't get stuck with more than a couple tables at a time. I talked to the manager who at first seemed to be shocked, then did nothing about it. The server was fairly polite but the host and manager ruined it.  Arcade: Decent. Far below the other GWs I've been to.  There's a reason there was no adult parties here alone. Only kids or parents with their kids. The service is God awful and the food is below gas station fare. The Seattle location is always packed and has more adults than kids. Take a lesson from them.   If you've ever been to a chuckee cheese in the 90s, think of that, with way worse pizza, 5x more expensive food and gaming, and god awful service."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for family parties and it's always a good time! It's a great place for kids and adults to have fun. The most recent visit there was a problem with our time card and the manager Ron took care of it quickly without any problems. This is definitely a place a would recommend to other families!"}
{"text":"Went there on Sat 5/13 with 4 kids and 2 adults from 5pm-6pm. Paid $52 for two new cards for $22 with 125 points on them each.We opted for these kind of cards so the kids could play the ticket redemption games. We had 2 kids share a card and it took them about an hour to go through it. We redeemed our tickets and went into the BARE prize area. A lot of bins were empty and everything seemed to be overpriced (compared to Dave and Busters). One of the prize bins CLEARLY had marked 10 tickets for a single piece of candy. So my kids loaded up on these because they could get a bunch of them. When we got to the counter to check out the clerk (whom was very rude) starts arguing with us that the candies are 20 tickets each not 10. We show him the sign on the huge bin of candies and he rips it off and said, \"That's wrong, it's 20 tickets.\" He was extremely rude and unforgiving and this attitude alone will make me NEVER go here again.  Pros: -Inside AZ Mill Mall  Cons: -Extremely rude workers - where I purchased our game cards and the ticket redemption area -Lots of the games were broken -Games that had seats, the seats were extremely torn and worn out -Women's bathroom was disgusting, not sure if they check it regularly -Expensive ticket redemption prizes  My conclusion: I will never take my family here again."}
{"text":"I like going here, but honestly last time was probably my last time there. I feel like there's not enough to do to keep you from being bored. And half the time people have need spilled all over the games."}
{"text":"Should be called Nothing Works. 70% of the games were broken. On the two player games only one player worked. They should have spent less money on the out of order signs and more money on the AC. Holy B.O.!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my kid's enjoyment of the place, and on the atmosphere. My 5 and 8 yr old boys had a blast, played for three hours non-stop and wanted more. They could've stayed in there all week. I'm not much of an arcade fan, but I can see the place's appeal- it had a bunch of motion games, like the ones where you move like you're actually in the cockpit of a plane, or inside a racecar. The timeplay cards made it convenient for me, since I didn't have to keep giving them quarters every 15 minutes, like at Circus Circus. It is kind of pricey, but when you consider the quality of the games, I guess they can justify the premium. And most importantly, my boys had a blast."}
{"text":"Was there recently. Had an issue with my old card. Chad fixed us right up!!! We had a great time. Thanks for the help Chad!!!  If you have or are a gamer, must check it out. So happy they re-opened in Vegas. Great location at town square!!! GO HAVE A BLAST !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"only bad part about happy hour here is that it keeps changing. it used to be $3 well drinks from 3-6 along with special prices for beer and wine. now its just drafts are $2 and wines by the glass are $4. food at happy hour is not a deal. its always best to call before arriving."}
{"text":"First off I'd like to thank the kid Nick at game work who helped me out with my misplaced order of pizza that was given away to some other kid in the internet cafe. The manager Joseph totally blew me off when I tried to talk to him. At least act like your listening instead of just saying \"uh, huh. We got you\" . By the way I did not know that he was the manager until after my order was fixed.       . I tried to tell Joseph which computer My brother, son and I was sitting.  We waited about 30 mins for a personal size looking pizza.  Nick came and check on us 2 times as he always makes his rounds around the cafe every time I've visted.  Finally I asked for his help which he got done faster than Joseph has. Nick completely took care of my brother and son after. But he is just a great up beat worker overall every time we have gone into game works he has been helpful and always checking on the kids. Great and attentive.  Joseph it was nice giving me the reason why things weren't done. BUT NICK GOT THEM DONE FOR US. As well as the other 2 employees that was with him."}
{"text":"Just witnessed the manager yelling at a bunch of customers. This is supposed to be a family freandly place. Im now no longer comfortable coming here. My children don't need to hear this!!"}
{"text":"Brandon at the ticket exchange center made this experience the best I could hope for. He assisted me in obtaining a Sonic the Hedgehog beanie and tee shirt for my 7 year old daughter (who can't seem to get enough of the blue, spiky headed, dude) after the upstairs kiosk had closed for the day. There are a myriad of games to enjoy. Our group consisted of ages 7 to 30, and the five of us enjoyed every minute of the three hours we spent there. If I had more than two thumbs, they'd all be up!"}
{"text":"GameWorks was an awesome experience for my family and I. We started with delicious,well made Sweet Thai Chicken Sandwiches and the crispy, chicken Tenders as well. The meal took a little while to be served but the service was great. While waiting we realized that the television was uncomfortable to watch at times because the contrast was WAY too high.  After our meal we bought game cards. First, we had to buy a new card that was $2 and then the actual credits range from ($5-$50) and then if you want to supersize the amount of credits you get, that's an extra $2 dollars as well. The prices of the credits weren't too bad but to actually enjoy yourself, you have to spend at least $20 due to how much credits each game takes. Overall GameWorks is SUPER fun and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I brought my kids here after lunch today to kill a few hours. We had a great time. My son was really excited about redeeming his tickets and we got lucky because an employee named Jonathan M helped us out. Apparently we missed a few big ticket games, and since we still had 15 minutes, we went back and totally scored!! Jonathan got down to my 5 year olds level and told him what the coolest prizes were and boosted his confidence by congratulating him on ALL the tickets he won. :) He even talked him into sharing something with his little sister, so everyone went home happy. My son can't wait to go back because he thinks Jonathan is his best friend now. Thanks Gameworks! You have our business for life!"}
{"text":"This place is about 1/3 the size of the old one. Although the location is better. Way to small and not enough games, wasting time just waiting. Service sucks! Sat down and waited 20 minutes before I had to call over the server. Ordered two soft drinks 20 minutes later still waiting... it's Saturday night! Management get your cap together with your scheduling, you should have more than one girl running the entire restaurant area!!"}
{"text":"It's really disappointing that I went out of my way on my vacation to visit this arcade only to find that the majority of the games (other than the ticket games) are unplayable or outright broken. I only played anything because I happened to have a gameworks card with credits already on them. I walked away in the middle of several games, as it was too frustrating to try to work with unresponsive and/or vandalized games."}
{"text":"Mixing alcohol and playing video games...tons of broken controls and upset kids.  Wow, I love it! I'm a little disappointed that they didn't have any roller coaster rides or a bigger venue. It was fun playing House of the living dead with Chris and Eric, we were hardcore playing maneuvering around, kneeling, jumping,etc etc. With a 40+ gameworks glass full of margarita in my hand, I was able to play at my finest.   Ups: Riding the Harley with Lauren           Killing zombie with AJ, Christopher, and Eric. Downs: No more alcohol"}
{"text":"Recently was shopping in Town Square on a Sunday and thought I would stop by and have a drink with my girlfriend. And out of all the places to stop by, I chose the wrong place.  Service was EXTREMELY slow. Took the bartender 10 to notice we been sitting at the bar. On top of that, after we placed our order he FORGOT to get it! It's not like they were busy, let's be real.  We thought we would bring you business, however I see you didn't want it. The operations seem to act just like the children running around the place.   If stopping by Town Square, I recommend going anywhere else for a cocktail/beer BUT here."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place at first but I stumbled in to play my friend Jimmy at the basketball game because we wanted to kill some time. We ended up walking into the bowling alley bar, and our bartender, Heather was way cool. She knew how to make her drinks and was very personable. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I'm been in the hospitality industry for 12 years, so take my opinion as you wish.  Location is better than before, but much smaller.  I will never eat there again.  Food was bad not to mention cold.  We were the only ones there, should have been a hint, and the service was so slow you would think the place was packed.  I may take my son back to play, but wouldn't touch the food, especially with so many options in town square.  I've seen many of my customers with infinitely better food and atmosphere close shop.  Unless something drastically changes, I don't see this place lasting."}
{"text":"Great deal for the whole  family  show your harkins movie  ticket within 3 hrs of show to get $10 free game play per ticket holder. Also eat for $5 on wednesdays 5-10 and get a $10 free game play."}
{"text":"**Birthday Party Review** We had my sons birthday here today. I would HIGHLY recommend Gameworks as the venue for your next party. While I agree with other reviewers that the food leaves a great deal of room the improvement the party packages and service more than make up for it. My guests had a wonderful time and our host Zach was the greatest! We booked the party mostly by email with Allie and she too was a pleasure to work with. If you are looking for a party venue I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I can't give an all too extensive review because we were mostly secluded in the billiards area of the main bar (by the entry way). It was date night but there was a long pause between dinner and the movie so we tried our hand at gaming. We walked through, a lot of seemingly unsupervised teens but no issues and a few families. We decided on pool and beers. It was $5 per hour for the table and about $6.50 per beer, but of course. The table was a little rough but we weren't auditioning for \"The Color of Money\" so no worries. If the bartender had been more attentive (or the bar back to be specific), we'd have spent a lot more to keep the beer flowing. It also took a bit to check out and settle the table tab, because again, the Bar Back was preoccupied with... something, whatever it was, keeping his conversation with fellow employees on point and fairly oblivious to customers. The bar was pretty empty for a Friday evening. Overall,  an 'okay' experience for a limited one."}
{"text":"enjoy coming here to break away from the usual going out but there is always some sort of issue. first time we came here we were seated at the bar with no bartender. waited fifteen minutes and kept seeing an employee poke her head out and look at us from in back. after having to find a manager we finally received service. manager comped us our first round. last time I came had some lady throw a drink on me and she wasn't kicked out. they claimed because she has a kid even tho she's in here all the time and never spends any money, even the bar staff told us they have to kick her out all of the time due to complaints. manager comped us 2 hr play cards. today decided to take advantage of the entertainment industry happy hour from 3pm-close. upon getting here bar didn't know what it was and manager tried telling me it's difficult to see on the website? when you go to games works website you select your location for the deals so it's listed clear as day on there so I'm not exactly sure what he was talking about as I showed him on my phone. the 2 guy bartenders that were together are usually here when we come in and they're nice so 2 stars for that. also should probably remove the picture of a Moscow mule from the happy hour menu since it's not part of it."}
{"text":"Total chill spot, like a mini Dave & Busters. Small arcade/gaming area & big bar to hang out at. Cool thing is there's a small bowling alley actually inside in another room, so definitely is a twist to the environment. Came here with several friends & their children, the kids loved it & we had a great time with beer & bowling."}
{"text":"What a Total waste of time !! The Last time I went to this Gameworks was about 2 years ago, and now I refuse to go back.  I purchased my \"All Day Pass\" from the Tix2Nite booth in downtown for $17.50 plus a $4 service fee. I didn't mind this, as I was planning togo in and out during the day and to play a lot of the new games that where there since the last I was there. When I walked in, the first thing I noticed was how many games were taken out since the last time I was there. They ripped out a whole block of games, and installed some sort of crappy \"virtual bowling\". They also took out some other ones to but a buffet area for special events. No problem I thought, and proceeded to exchange my voucher.  After exchanging my ticket, the first arcade I wanted to play was the House of the Dead 4. After waiting a while, I asked the cashier where the operator was. She told me that he was on break, and to check back in a half hour. When I came back it was the same BS story. This was true for all the operator assisted games. Even the regular games had problems with them, as 17 were broken at the time. When I asked the manager what was going on, he told me that Gameworks had to cut hours. I felt ripped off !!! Do yourself a favor and stay far and away from this poorly run arcade.   On the plus side, I found a kick ass pinball museum in Las Vegas. There must of been over 100 games that went from the 1930's on up. The owner is very nice, and he is also the one the service's the machine too. Their site is (http://www.pinballmuseum.org)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. I went there the other day in a date. Probably not the best place for a first date. Whenever you come here it is always busy. There a lot of games that you're able to play but some of them you do need to wait especially for the popular games."}
{"text":"Went the other night and our server Sahara was amazing. Will definately go to gameworks again."}
{"text":"Grat for all ages.... Brings me back to the good old days with some games. Had a blast. And they have a bar with food and a lot of tv's. Will bring my kids n family here"}
{"text":"Gameworks seems too crowded. Every machine was Taken, so you practically have to fall in line for every game. We went on a Saturday afternoon/evening time. During the week it's probably much less busy so at least one game could be playable without having to wait. Had a done in and the service was quick and delicious. No problems with that. And I felt that there were too many racing games. Not enough 4 player games or FPS. Nice location, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I took my little brother here so he can occupy himself all day with the 35 dollar all day pass. It is pretty expensive for the limited selection of games...a lot of old games, too many of which are old shooters and racing simulators. The worst part was the fact that a lot of the games were broken down and the staff of three people could not be bothered with fixing them.   Oh well, what else would you do with a little kid in Vegas? There's a few fun games here and there....like a two person racing game where you alternate control of the wheel and an air hockey game where each person gets 2 hitting things and there's 3 pucks in plane. There's a few nice flight simulator games....definitely better than just sitting in the hotel room if you are under 21.   If you are over 21, it's probably more fun to play 35 dollars worth of slots."}
{"text":"Walked in and walked right out. Place is dirty and smelly. Staff is rude and doesn't like to interact with anyone. Walked by the bartenders and they were too busy socializing with each other then serving drinks. Kids run around unsupervised and the parents let them. This is like a wanna be kidz quest with parents mixed in. Waiting for Dave and Busters to come to Vegas like..."}
{"text":"Best Features: Karaoke and Photo Booth  If you thought you remembered Gameworks, guess again.  About 2 years ago, Sega bought the company and all of it's assets and has slowly been turning every Gameworks in the nation into a Japanese style \"Game Center.\"  It's no secret that arcade gaming has been on the decline for the last two decades due to home console games, and in America the industry has almost disappeared save for a few small companies.    The Japanese business model has definitely changed the dynamics of the place - there are now two small Karaoke booths (With songs in English but a book for Japanese, Chinese and Korean songs is available too), a Japanese style Photo Booth (very fun), a room of ufo catchers, 3 dance machines and a slew of other new things on the way.  The old Gameworks mainstays like the Indy 500 game and that vertical shooting thing still remain.  The only downside is the price.  You must purchase a card to play anything and rather than tell you the monetary value, they use points.  It's easy to lost the value in your mind as you are going from game to game.  Make sure to conserve your money or else you might be making a few trips like I did, dropping 20 bucks a pop."}
{"text":"Kind of small compared to other ones I've been to but the kiddo still had fun.  Just a tip: when you insert your card in the ticket counting machine, leave it in there or else you will get an error message.  The hubs and I kept pulling it out (like when you're at the gas station using your credit card) so imagine how much of an idiot we felt like when we finally figured it out.  Mind you, he's the smarter one and I'm the one who figured it out.  One point for me!"}
{"text":"It was a Thursday afternoon and we had just arrived in Vegas. After checking into our hotel and eating some tasty, tasty oysters at Harrah's, we were looking for something to occupy ourselves until dinner. I played some slots and video poker, but the machines were not being kind to me. What to do now? \"How about an arcade?\" my boyfriend said. I remembered this Gameworks.   We walked over and bought ourselves a $20 card. We thought that might occupy us for a little while, and then we'd figure out something else to do. As we walked off the escalator into the cavernous game-filled area, some random guy approached us. He and his kids were leaving, and he had two unlimited gaming cards that weren't set to expire for another few hours. Did we want them? But of course.   So we spent a couple of hours down in that gaming area, using those unlimited cards to play many different shooting, fighting, and racing games. Then, when we finally got bored of that, we used the card we bought for all the ticket-giving games. It was glorious. Games, games, everywhere! We even ended up with enough tickets for a souvenir shot glass. It was awesome.   Gameworks: a pleasant diversion, especially with an unexpected unlimited pass.   w00t!"}
{"text":"Place was awesome and was the base of many great memories. I had a bunch of birthdays there and once I was old enough, I would go play some games and have a few beers. Food wasn't great but that's not what I was there for. Lots of games and decent prizes. Wasn't anymore expensive than anything like it in the valley and added a fun dynamic to a pretty lame mall.   I was really surprised to hear it closed. With all the new, douchey crap poping up in the valley, its to bad somethig fun had to be cleared out to make room."}
{"text":"We had some time to kill after a movie, so we stopped in after seeing a sign for free game play with a movie ticket. They offer 30 minutes of free gaming, all you have to do is show your ticket stub from Harkins - score! We were able to get our fill in that 30 minutes, so I'm not sure how they are making $ on this deal, but we look forward to doing this again. I was kind of confused as to where you would order food. The place isn't laid out well and it seems as if they are short staffed. Would be a great place for a kids party."}
{"text":"I'd recommend going in while they have their daily specials. (Have different ones for different days) If you remember the GameWorks that was on the strip, this place won't be as spacious and more condensed. Still offers tickets/prizes. Wish they had more games they had in their previous location :( choices pretty much were racing or shooting + the sport arcades.  Keep you gamecard so with the next visit, you can reload the card and not pay for an extra.  If you plan on spending some time at the bar, plenty of TV's!! The food is rather pricey, so I'd recommend waiting till happy hour (starts 9pm)  You honestly can't expect any service if you're at the bar just keep that in mind. You might see someone right when you order, then they disappear."}
{"text":"I don't care what anyone says, I had an amazing time here. Although it's not as big as the old gameworks on the strip, there are still plenty of enjoyable games for any age limit. Unfortunately the first game I played had a little problem and it wasn't working at all, so I wanted to speak to a manager about it because I didn't receive the points I won. The manager, Charles was so polite and friendly. He eventually refunded our points and had a tech to fix the game. It's my favorite game so far."}
{"text":"I have a very easy system for grading arcades.  It's as follows:  Do all four arrows work on their Dance Dance Revolution?  No?  Well then you fail, Gameworks.  You fail hard."}
{"text":"Being a gamer I had to check out this place. I've never been to the original GameWorks, but this place wasn't as bad as I had expected. My gf and I stopped by here to check out some of the old arcade and VR games. The prices are bit high for the games and drinks are pricey as well. Overall its a place to check out once."}
{"text":"If you are all about the video games and can play for 2 hours straight then this is the place for you, especially with a 2 hour unlimited pass.  I'm just not that guy.  I do love me some games and had a good time but after about 45 minutes I didn't know what to do with myself.  I think the janky version of guitar hero called Guitar Freaks killed my will to live.  I did like the shooting games and that one really cool jet fighter game.  I almost ripped off my shirt and challenged AJ to a topless game of beach volleyball after a few successful bombing missions, 'cause that is what all gay fighter pilots do...right?  Plus, I had titties on the brain and there weren't any here being jiggled around.  I mean there were but it would have been inappropriate for me to be seeing those titties, whereas titties at another location would be fine since they were being shown for money and all."}
{"text":"Awesome place to go and hang out at and play games but there is zero types of security or supervision, the girl I was with got her whole purse stolen and the manager did nothing to help. Again I love the place just not the service and crowd."}
{"text":"We walk in and meet a nice lady where we buy the card with credits. First game we play and it takes our 9 credits and doesn't work. Well that was great. Credits do cost money it's not like we were on some play for so many hours thing. Things were pretty cool from there until we got to the giant fish reel. The reel says we won 70 tickets awesome, the box even says we were awarded 70. So of course since 70 is a lot lets play again. This time the giant reel says we won 60 tickets! Child is super excited and I look down at the box and it says 15 tickets awarded. WHAT?! So I got robbed of 9 credits and at least 45 tickets. Never thought to watch any of the other times we won tickets so who knows how many Game Works really stole from us. It was over all a good time, just left a bad feeling knowing we got ripped off."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Ignore the rest of the reviews!  The staff are all amazing!  Corin, Nathan and the rest of the team! Awesome games & it's clean and nice.  98% of the games work!  We played for several hours.  Awesome facility  Tip  Great Groupon coupons tickets  Mall close by and next to MovieS"}
{"text":"Jarred was such a very nice guy, he made it sure that everyone of us are satisfied the way they cooked the food"}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for game works, I'd never gone before  and I was hoping it was like Dave and busters, which is so much fun. Negative. Most of the games were broken in the arcade. We were limited to playing like 4-5 games. We tried to go upstairs in the bar area to play pool and drink, the pool table was out of order. Not worth my money, definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last night. We decided to sit at the bar. The bar was not busy in the least bit and there were 4 people working behind the bar. It took 10 minutes for someone to even acknowledge us. After that, another 5 minutes to take our drink orders. After we ordered, we watch the bartender as he scrambled to figure out where everything was. Our drinks were simple, not fancy at all, one vodka soda and a whiskey coke. After looking for a couple of minutes, he comes back and tells me that they're out of the vodka I wanted, so I quickly picked another. He took about 4 minutes to make each drink. After sitting for 30 minutes at a half empty bar, we finally got our drinks. If this is the way the service will go, we will not be returning and I'm sure it will not create any repeat customers."}
{"text":"We went in for the first time.  For family time. Ordered food(pizza) it was not great to be honest it tasted like microwave food. It was a bit pricie but the games where so much fun! We will come back for the games not food."}
{"text":"I have the best memories with the boyfriend at gameworks. Super fun. Go on Tuesdays for double tickets!"}
{"text":"Always having a wonderful time with the kids specially when they offer deals that will invite us back in for more game time."}
{"text":"First time we went there, got a drink at the bar and bartender charged more for drinks with no receipt and didn't think we would notice. Gave it one more chance and tried the meal and play for 14.99. The waitress was terrible, the sandwich was toasted and was so hard it cut up my mouth. Waitress gave us someone else's check. All over terrible service!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Smaller than expected it to be. Not really wowed. There was a bar, which is a plus. But for a Saturday night.. The bar was completely understaffed. This is probably the longest I had to wait for a drink. Which made me a little irritated. Pricing was not bad compared to other places on the strip. Decor is very nice... But they need to staff accordingly!!!!! Not as many games as the previous GAMEWORKS in Vegas. The bathrooms were a little dirty as well. I would come back to see if this would change."}
{"text":"My recent trip to Las Vegas, my friends and I ended up at GameWorks. Not sure how it would turn out, but we had a blast. The games / activities were cool and not remotely \"Chucky Cheese\" style. The food was good. The bar was nice and our bartender Tyler had just the right vibe. I would go back on my next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon for half off the all-day passes, so for roughly $80 we got 4 cards. The deal itself was decent, although almost all of the games were some sort of racing game. Many games were broken or not working at full capacity.  If you really want a fun and cheaper gaming experience, check out the Pinball Hall of Fame. It's a few minutes off the Strip on Tropicana Ave, but for only $25, 4 people enjoyed hours of pinball and nostalgic arcade games, and that total price included a snack! Check out the Pinball HOF on Yelp... it's a 5-star place!"}
{"text":"Recently took our son here for a celebration, we came on a weekday so it would be less crowded and we could enjoy the games. After purchasing put game card we discovered 50% or more of the games were broken and most of the others we tried to play either were malfunctioning or would freeze while we were playing. Along with that there was no one to greet us as we walked in. Apparently they were not serving food that day either which we learned by a taped piece of paper on the wall.  The carpets are filthy and the smell inside is quite unpleasant.  We came here when they first opened and it was great, but has gone down hill fast."}
{"text":"We were so excited to come in seeing that there was an article written up about Game Works. We came in, bought a card and then started browsing for games. I would say every other game was broken. This is the worst arcade I've ever been to. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just recently had a holiday party at gameworks and it was great! Thank you Ron Arenas for making this happen! The kids and the adults all had a good time there!"}
{"text":"Chicken strips were quite juicy with a nice crunchy coat, the wings had a little too much sauce, fries were cooked but would have liked them cooked longer so they weren't so flimsy, mozzarella sticks were perfect, and the potato skins were a bit too salty."}
{"text":"I was honestly surprised at how much fun we had here. We came by for a late lunch on a weekday and it was almost empty and devoid of small children. We sat at the bar and ordered an Irish Mai Tai (has beer in it) and a blackberry Moscow Mule. They weren't exactly stellar cocktails, but they were tasty enough. On the menu are several items where, if you order them, you can opt to pay more and get a 1-hour game card. This seemed like a great deal. We opted for the nachos, which were priced at $12. By paying $14.99, instead of $12, we got a game card for all the games letting us play whatever we wanted for 1-hr. The one catch is that you can't earn tickets when playing with a timeframe card. But you definitely get a lot more play for you money. The nachos were pretty good. Standard bar fare. The selection of games was pretty good, including some unique ones we'd never seen before. In addition to skee ball and some of the other usual suspects, there was also a motion roller coaster ride and a 4D scary shooting game one. In sum, we had a great time and will be back for more fun."}
{"text":"This place is good times every once in awhile. There are tons of fancy new arcade games like dance dance revolution and stuff downstairs, but upstairs is where i like to hang out. first, because there's a bar up there, where they also serve food. i've never eaten it, but i'm betting it's just so-so and probably overpriced because the drinks are. but also upstairs are all the old school games like ms. pacman, asteroids, mario bros. and they're all 25 cents.  it's also inside a mall and right by the movies, so it's fun to stop in when you have a few minutes to kill."}
{"text":"Stopped by with the kiddies to take a break from the strip and was pleasantly surprised. Everything was clean and the staff was friendly. The reason for only 4 stars is a few of the games didn't work and there weren't any signs indicating this so we lost credits. Also, I used an amazing Groupon deal - I don't know if I'd come back without it. On a side note, the prize selection for tickets is great- lots of items at different values."}
{"text":"What happened to GameWorks?  I understand they had to make changes after moving from the Strip.  But my expectations were so much higher.  You walk into the new location and it almost seems empty.  There is a lot of square footage, but not enough games to fill the space.    I am not a gamer.  But I do enjoy sports, driving, and flying games.  They had a bit of a selection, but it seemed like there could've been so much more.    My experience here was okay, but I don't see myself coming back anytime soon.  I hope as time goes on, GameWorks is able to get to something near what the Strip location was."}
{"text":"I want to give a shout out to Ron the Mgr and his team at GAMEWORKS for the most excellent time we had at their establishment. Hawaiian Airlines recently had our holiday party held there on Jan 21st and it was the best party EVER!!! Ron made sure the party went on with no worries and no problems. Lets not forget their delicious food we ate Pizzas cheese and Meathead pizza's, kids favorite sliders, calamari, chicken tenders, chicken wings, and their chicken cobb salad and caesar salad was a hit with everyone. Our families enjoyed themselves and we definitely recommend any company or families who are looking for a place to hold their events at. This is the guy to see Mgr Ron Arenas at Gameworks at the Town Centre Mall"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the \"New and Improved\" GameWorks. I do understand it is a smaller location from there last, but its so cramped in there. Usually lines for arcades that dont even work right. Over-priced. Just not a place where I would spend my day with friends."}
{"text":"Had fun bowling with the family. Nice small alley with 8 lanes. A great way to end our day."}
{"text":"good place to take the kids to run around in   They have bowling  they have a pool table  They have a computer room  with X box's and PS4's they have Couches sit and play the x box's and ps4's  They have a restaurant with good food And of course all the arcade games   There is a deal of unlimited plays make sure to ask about it   everytime we come to Vegas we stop by this spot to play with the kids  u need to see for ur self go check it out"}
{"text":"My friend and I went here to do the purikura. It was pretty cheap compared to HI. Also, the bowling alley was really fun."}
{"text":"My expectation for gameworks is that the games actually work. We opted for an hour unlimited play, which we understood that we wouldn't be getting tickets and about 12 machines that weren't valid with our pass. However, there were a large number of machines that were out of order. Especially a lot of the driving games with 2 player options had 1 player not working.  I feel like the maintenance of their machines used to be a lot better, or maybe the machines are just getting old and they are due for new ones. We still had fun with the ones that still worked, but I was pretty disappointed. They also have a bar here with reasonable prices along with a menu for food too."}
{"text":"You know what, I had a good experience at GameWorks! I think that there could be more games (there was a pretty large, and empty, dining area), but it was clean, well maintained, and the games they had were quite entertaining. The Pac Man air hockey game was a big hit! Although they don't have a DJ and dance floor like they do at Insert Coins, this was still a good time.  I also liked that they had a full bar with drinks that weren't overpriced. The bowling alley also looked very intriguing, but alas, we didn't have an opportunity to bowl on this occasion.   I think that this is a great option for kids and adults alike! Game On!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. I can leave my son here for hours. Last several times here, I scored the Groupon deal for $20, all day pass. That is a bargain. Love the fact that you can even play basketball toss and skee ball with the pass. We went for three hours, went to a basketball tournament, grabbed dinner, then came back for another two hours. Awesome place, awesome deal."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Gameworks in about 5-6 years.  I remember the one in Michigan being a lot different.  I thought it was a pity when they closed but I think I see why after my visit here.    Holy expensive!  I bought the deal on Groupon.  I thought a little over half off was a good deal!  $20 for a full day of games. (This is based on what we could play with the groupon) If I would have known that the place consisted of a high majority of extremely similar fighting games and racing games I would have probably passed.  Quite a few of the games either were broken or did not work at all.  The restaurant has good food. My better half was a little upset paid $9 for only 4 chicken fingers, but they were tasty nonetheless.   I'm not impressed, they have nothing there that would convince me to go again."}
{"text":"This place is a shell of its former self. Game works used to be a great place to go to for gaming.  I came here with my son because I remember as a teenager this place being the shit at its former location in Vegas but now that it's in this location it just isn't what it used to be. My son had fun regardless but I was just thrown off at how basic its become."}
{"text":"Thank you Shana for your awesome service and for helping me with the surprise cake for my daughter thank you. .."}
{"text":"You're better off at Dave and Busters. The games are super old and the place smells like kids sitting around in their own crap. Gross."}
{"text":"We had our company party here and it was a success! Everyone Seemed to enjoy themselves, especially the children. Just want to give a shout out to Ron Arenas, Manager for all your help with our function and his crew! Awesome job!"}
{"text":"Reading throughout the reviews in the past year. Games have been broken and still have not been fixed. I've talked to multiple managers and game techs and I guess they just refuse to fix the games. Terrible arcade management.  And they also doubled the ticket prices  on most of the high end items ( Xbox one PS4 iPads ). Shitty arcade would not reccomend.   If they have a broken game they will just turn the machine off and machines will be. broken weeks and weeks or forever. Literally ."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Gameworks for a few years now.  I befriended the bartender Noah, who has a very extensive knowledge of fun shots and drinks.  The food is a bit on the expensive side, but if you get a drink or two and head on to the game floor you won't have to spend too much cash.  The games are always being updated, and while some games are simple, like the claw-grabber machines, there are great flight simulators, shooter games and great two player, multi-player, and versus games if you are in a group. When you purchase a game card be sure to pay the $2 upgrade for a bunch of extra credits.  Usually I'll spend $20 on the game card and add the $2 upgrade and I can play for a couple of hours straight.  There a also games that give you tickets as a reward which can be spent at the little store. I got a mini lava lamp for my desk at work after one night of collecting tickets with a friend.  One of the best parts of Gameworks is that after 10pm the second level is for adults only. The second floor also has many classic games like Super Mario Bros., and Rampage.  If you are looking to avoid the ever-present hoards of kids, go on a weeknight and go late."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot for a night out with friends or a day with the family. There are tons of games, bowling, food and drinks (for the adults ). We have been here a few times and each time of course the kids left very happy (and tired, thankfully). They have games for tickets which can be traded in for prizes in the end as well as a room full of computer/video games. Games for everyone!   They have a few pretty good deals for games only but the one we took advantage of was the unlimited play for an hour with an entree.   There was some miscommunication between how to purchase the deal and we got sent around to 3 different people so that was a bit frustrating. Only other downfall was the service in the restaurant. We waited for almost 10 minutes before anyone came and greeted us or got our drinks, then another 30 minutes for our food. I'm not a master chef but I don't think our nachos, cheese pizza and burger takes that long to prepare. Also, our server was less than attentive. Nonetheless, I know people don't go there for the food its just an added incentive while you are there to play games!!!!   Cool spot again to drink and play games, maybe dine at another nearby establishment though."}
{"text":"It's nice to see Gameworks back in Vegas, since I remember going to the old location on the strip. By comparison,  this new location is a ton newer but also smaller. It's nice to see that everything isn't falling apart and all the games are clean and actually work!  I'm not sure though why they made the restaurant area so large because Gameworks is usually an arcade first and restaurant second. I've been to multiple locations around the country and all of them have a much much larger gaming area than restaurant. The restaurant also has a ton of wasted space that could've been used to accommodate games so that it doesn't feel as cramped inside when you're playing. The only thing I like about the restaurant is the TVs and projector screens they have all around. Makes this a great place to watch sports!  The games themselves are decent although not a whole lot seemed to spark my interest. Most of them are pretty expensive too, costing approximately 7-12 credits. Each credit is 25 cents unless you buy in large dollar amounts such as $50-100.  Overall Gameworks at Town Square is a good place to hang out or kill some time, but wouldn't be a place I'd visit frequently."}
{"text":"Overall this was quite a disappointing experience. I first came here with a friend of mine who grew up in Arizona and he used to frequent this place. Although we didn't play any of the arcade games downstairs we went upstairs to the bar area where there are pool tables available. On a more recent visit I decided to take advantage of the remaining credit on my game card and there were only a few arcade games that I was interested in. It seems like Dave & Busters have a much better selection and after my recent visit I would rather head there instead."}
{"text":"So always been fan of the concept of GameWorks since I visited one in Seattle years ago. The whole different arcade games some throwbacks, current games, and interactive games with the EA sport area not mention the indoor bowling alley. Not forget about the little ones for games earn tickets then redeem them later. The whole bar/restaurant area that something like but not fan at the same time. It nice that they offer good diversity of food not your basic bar menu grub all deep fried or off the grill. I like the location of this GameWorks in Town Square Mall on the strip. I like the fact they serve beers by the pitchers as option!  I like fact that tons of televisions all over the place in the bar and restaurant area for sports. Not fan the bar area. It hardly feels like bar area that can lounge around and relax with friends. Your right smack next to the entrance so see people coming and going or kids running around. It could be good thing free entertainment. LOL. The service was awful. I went up two separate occasions the first time. Not sure if he was bartender or bar back. The guy cleaning glasses working not once did he acknowledge me. I literally was standing in front of his face the whole time. Hi. Someone will be with you. The other two bartenders just whatever I had get there attention just get drink. The bar had no personality feel like counter top in middle of open space. The restaurant area itself not much better with personality feels like more cafeteria setting I feel just open space with tables and couple booths outside. Service at times was not on it. To be fair came to GameWorks after friends wedding reception for night cap get together. Everyone showed at random times. They did do fabulous job with no reservations rearrange tables (we helped moved them or they did) ended up with over 30 peeps spread out over three or four tables. Well done.   I had some of my friends food. I tried the pretzel bites. They were ok. The cheese sauce tasted out of can. The nachos that was solid. It was loaded with pretty much everything. Really all the food saw coming out to the table looked good.   If playing tourist GameWorks is place that might stop by again. If want throw back days in 808 going Tilt or Fun Factory (local peeps would appreciate the shout out) would go GameWorks. The food and drinks honest so many other great spots in Town Square would skip that part at GameWorks."}
{"text":"There is bowling here. It's not bad, enough space for the families to sit around and hang out. The downfall, there was no one working at the bar within the bowling area. Made it difficult for everyone to look after their belongings and children while ordering food and drinks. lol. Enjoy the ugly neon shoes.    I did however like the pretzels with spicy cheese dip.   Highlight: the photobooth.  Spend forever personalizing your photos.  Fun!"}
{"text":"This place brings back childhood memories. We used to have a Gameworks day once or twice a year when all my family is in town. Add it was great because we can go to M&M factory, Coke Factory, and then game all day. We were the ones always hogging the air hockey table for the entire day. It isn't quite as fun anymore. I remember there used to be a wall climbing thing here once upon a time. Or maybe I am imagining it. Me and my poor memory. Sorry.  So recently I was here with a group of friends. We got a couple all day passes and then realized there isn't many games that I wanted to play. But the racing car thing in the back by the restaurant was fun. And the shooting games. But the guys in the group had a good time.  Stopped by again 2 days ago. Had some wings. They do have happy hour pricing though. Nothing special, but not bad. This place just really isn't for locals over 16."}
{"text":"The games are lots of fun, but the food is terrible and service worse. Come for the games go elsewhere for food"}
{"text":"I went to a group thing here and had a better time than I thought I would.  Service at the bar was good, and there was a nice drawing-room style chill out room if you wanted to get away from the kiddie casino vibe of the rest of the place.  I also liked the row of old skool games for geezers like me that haven't played since we were kids -- Centipede, Pac Man, Frogger, Mario Bros, etc.  I never made it down to the skee ball area, but you know I would've taken the local kids OUT."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst arcade experiences I have ever had in Las Vegas, and I'm a local born and raised here! I would say about 30% of the machines didn't even work, I got \"jipped\" on a 250 ticket \"jackpot\" that only ended up giving me 20 tickets on the bigger version of the ball drop game.   Half of the basketball games in the row were out of order. The cashier that rung me up was rude and didn't give me my card back right away. I think they forgot to turn the A/C on because it was like a sauna in there.   I would not recommend coming here at all. I'd say go to circus circus, the pinball hall of fame,Dave & Busters and even the Excalibur arcade is better than what they call this (because it's not an arcade in my opinion).   If I could give 0 stars, I definitely would."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely atrocious!!!  It seemed like an arcade graveyard. 50-60% of the games either didn't work, didn't accept the card, or were just plain not on. I saw on at least 3 different occasions where a 2 person shooter game only had 1 gun..  We sat down on another 2 person game, and the start button only worked for one player. The calibrations were off on a couple games (shooting far left, and the crosshairs are all the way over to the right).  The basketball games with their sad, deflated basketballs, with pieces of the ball literally falling off. The one football game that did work, again had sad deflated footballs. However, I did see Tom Brady playing the game, and those deflated footballs really sent him over the top for the high score. This place is literally the biggest joke, and saddest excuse for an arcade that I've ever seen. This is Las Vegas... get your stuff together!    Ps...  GameWorks management, don't bother responding to apologize, and urge me to check out your rewards program. We will never set foot in here again. And for the sake of everyone's sanity..  Take your business off of Groupon. You're not set up to be anything more than an old, tired, rundown graveyard for games. Time to close the doors, and replace it with a Dave and Busters."}
{"text":"Jonathan mahr is the baddest dude on the planet! Figuring out this intricate system of gaming would have been an absolute impossibility without him!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing I've never really experienced GameWorks before, even back when it was on the Strip, and I've never been to a Dave and Busters so all of this is new to me. Anyways I've been to this location more than a few times and honestly I like it.  They have a bowling alley, a bar and restaurant, lots of arcade games, you can earn tickets and redeem them for prizes, billiard tables, lots of screens to catch a sports game playing, and even computer and console games area. You can play at the billiards tables for $5 an hr.  Food is your usual bar food I guess there's pizzas, burgers, chicken tenders, sandwiches, salads, etc. They even have a deal where certain items on the menu comes with an hr play of the arcade for like $15 and you can use the cards anytime for 1 hr straight. I kind of have been stashing them cause I have 3 cards.  Seems like a great place for families and people of all ages. Haven't had a bad experience yet and customer service has always been great. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Albeit a smaller venue, not too bad - kids enjoyed themselves! From my POV:  1. Space too small 2. Too much empty space in the front area so it seems like     they're still decorating or ran out of money 3. When you get a time play card, they fail to     tell you:     a. Can't collect the tickets from games     b. Can't play the \"win a prize\" games     c. Have to wait 1 minute in between swipes before you         can play a new game or add another person's turn -         therefore, your ACTUAL play time drops to 30         minutes  The food looks amazing - but doesn't taste as promising as it looks. Some food items can get pricey.  The eSports room was the area most enjoyed by my family.  Overall, there are other places to spend time with family and friends...I don't know how often we will be back."}
{"text":"Are your kids getting on your nerves? Aloha discounted babysitting! For the low cost of $37, they can play here all day while you enjoy yourselves at the bars they have on site.   I used to come to GameWorks as a kid. Walking in, I wasn't impressed. Way too many driving games! All of the other games are pretty retro. The do have a Deal or No Deal Game which is pretty cool for adults.  I definitely recommend it if you're staying on the strip with your children. They will love it. You will probably get bored if you don't want to get drunk so bring an iPad or something."}
{"text":"I give it two stars only because the food service was excellent by our server Ryan D (46).  The rest is a hot mess. How is this place still open?    You enter and head to the \"ticket\" area or at least you think you are because as a customer you have no idea how to start playing games?  We get to the middle of the place to a long line and look above and decide to order the family four pack special as it's Sunday.  $40 for a large pizza and four one hour passes.  Well needless to say after 7minutes in line we are told that we have to go upstairs and order that from our server?  What?  Seriously.  Could there not be a sign?  Could one not pay for the $40 and go pick up a pizza upstairs with a ticket?  One can always order drinks and appetizers with the server if they are worried about not getting their servers work??    Anyway then we hear a technical speech regarding the cards because you can't play games that dispense tickets.....seriously?  Which games are those?  Are they tagged?  In a certain area?  Are you kidding me?  The \"host\" notices the discontent and he looks spazzed out!  Do you work here dude or are you a disney animatronic?  How about up-sell and offer to sell me another card that works on the ticket games.... Not that I would really want to but bringing in a couple of 8 year olds ....they kind of like those tickets?!!!    Still confused about the way crap works in here and to no avail we buy a regular pass from the animatronic and my Husband goes off to let the kids play while i go order food.   Nope. They don't give you your passes until you close out ( are you freaking kidding me) or at least I am too agitated to ask our sweet server because so far my attitude of this place has gone downhill fast. Wondering why we didn't just go to Dave and busters?    So upstairs... All the old games are gone that once used to be on the wall, (the racing games and the old school games) and downstairs my husband is running into games that are out of order or don't take the card!!  Lol  No good place of business should be this darn complicated. It's ridiculous. Who are the people running this establishment?  Honestly... Even my 8 year old said , they should have videos up of people playing video games ( would help since they don't have any of the major ones) and this place could be cooler.   Don't know but won't be a bit surprised when this place closes for good.   Won't come here again. Save your money. Stick to Dave and busters at Tempe marketplace or order Gametruck to come to your house for a video game party experience.    Grrrrrrrrr"}
{"text":"Broken and old games, ridiculously high bar prices and a very dirty place all around. Total waste of money."}
{"text":"I never tried the food at Gameworks, so I wrote a review about the games. The arcade is very fun for kids aged 3-8. I ended up wasting 20 bucks playing low quality and overrated games for little kids. I was more interested into the eSports games, which is near the back of Gameworks. eSports interests Pre-Teens and up. eSports has a Wii U for Smash Bros and Mario Kart 8, XBox for Mortal Kombat X and Minecraft, PS4 for Call of Duty or Counter Strike Global Offensive, and a computer that can download any playable game for free. It's very cheap for 1 hour, 5 bucks. I look forward to playing MK8 and SSB4. r"}
{"text":"The ony thing i could think of was the same level of disappointment that i had when i visited the new wet n wild location last year... What is with these companies closing their locations down and making locals wait years for a new establishment that has less to offer than their previous location? Terrible way to earn your old customers back. Seems like a trend happening in Vegas and its really doing bad for tourism when all the companies are just penny-pinching and reopening shitty locations. Dont reopen if you can't deliver!"}
{"text":"This is one of the cleanest and nicest GameWorks we have ever visited. They have a bowling alley, a bar that serves food, pool tables, and of course a plethora of fun games. There is also a cool Gaming room where you can play online PC games, XBox and Nintendo games. Staff is nice too! We stop by here every time we are shopping at Town Square. :)"}
{"text":"This seemingly fun place that is hampered by a completely inept staff and a bunch of games in various states of disrepair.  I could've gotten over the staff being crappy if I could just play games that actually worked. I'll just go to the Pinball Hall of Fame to satisfy my nerdy urges properly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing been here about 5 times in the past month. I could be in here everyday and still not get tired of it! Just keep them shots of tequila coming and we're good! I'll try the food next time"}
{"text":"Worn out.  Many games broken.  Food not great and pricey.  Not impressed but my kids had fun... they are only 7 and 9 years old."}
{"text":"This place was fun at first, because we were bowling. We loved that they had bowling lanes. because dave and busters doesn't. Once we were done bowling we decided to go play the arcade games .. half of them didn't work- they had signs all over the place on the games saying they weren't working. They had a 3D experience you could go into but of course that wasn't working, a bunch of simulators weren't working, the luigi game was missing the gun for player 2 and the list goes on. This place was a joke.   The staff seemed to be used to it because if a machine took our credits they didn't even hesitate to put more on our card for us. They need to spend some money on fixing these machines- from the reviews it seems like they've been down for a while now."}
{"text":"If you have kids, drop them off here and go gamble.  Or if you're like me and have a boyfriend who doesn't gamble, drop them off here and go gamble.  I kid I kid.  BUT he did say he could spend all day here. Duly noted for our next trip LOL.  My boyfriend love arcades and he had a good time.  I don't really care for the games so I played on the ones that gave out tickets.  You don't need to deal with tokens or anything like that, just prepay on a card and swipe away.  FOOD: We had a restaurant.com certificate so we ate lunch here.  He had the BBQ baby back ribs and I had the Game Stopper burger (topped with an egg). Eh, food was so-so, can't expect much from an arcade eatery.  HOWEVER, their ICE CREAM FLOAT was DELICIOUSSSS! I would come back here just for the float.  Vanilla ice cream, oreo cookies, and soda blended together topped with Oreo cookie crumbles."}
{"text":"Came here on vacation with my family and was very disappointed. We spent $100 to last a while for the kids.  Over the course of an hour and a half my kids had easily accumulated nearly 2,000 tickets when we got to the cash out the girl at the register said we only had 320 tickets. My son played the fish game like 10 times alone and hit the 500 grand prize and 150 twice the girl said oh the machine isn't working then maybe put an out of order sheet on it.  Needless to say my kids got hosed and were upset about not being able to get what they wanted.  I even offered to just buy the toys they wanted and again the girl said uh we can't do that.  If I could give no stars I would.  BUYER BEWARE!"}
{"text":"This place has great potentially to be something extraordinary. But the lack of service is one of the worst I've ever seen. I was waiting at the bar for a drink while the bartender chick, ( tall dark hair ) pass by us for a good 15 minutes and through out that time she did not acknowledge us once, not even a simple ( I'll be right with you) she straight out ignore us. I never post reviews on yelp but this by far was the worst well I can't even called it service since I wasn't even helped. The past time I've gone there there is a guy bartender and usually he is on point and his service is phenomenal of they want this place to get regulars and keep more money coming I will suggested hiring a staff full of him cause the rest of the staff is by far the worst service industry people I've met."}
{"text":"Took my kids here they seemed to like it games are pretty cool and most of them work I like that the tickets go on the card.. games are a little pricey and parking is kinda hard it's allways busy on the weekend"}
{"text":"It's SO nice to have Game Works back! Wish it were as big as the old location on the Strip, but this is a nice modern twist, and in a great location.   Bowling, video games, photo booths, basketball hoop game (worth mentioning because its my favorite) drinks and food. Almost as good as Dave & Buster's. Kids loved it, Mom and Dad liked sitting in the restaurant area and letting the kids wreak havoc. Just kidding! We aren't *those* parents... well, at least not on that day =)"}
{"text":"This is a decent place. I bought the Groupon that came with the all-day game card and the $10 game card for the ticket games. My husband and I took our four kids.  I have to say that the all-day game card isn't really worth it. By two or three hours, you'll probably have had your fill of gaming. The arcade is not really that big. If you're there on a weekend, like we were, you'll have to deal with rude Vegas people cutting in front of you while you're waiting in line for a game. That was not fun. I feel like they could have cut back on the dining area, which seemed empty most of the time, to add more room for arcade games.  We ate dinner there and I thought it was reasonably priced for Vegas (except for the $9 mozzarella sticks). The food was good.   The location adds a lot of value to this place. When my younger kids got bored with games, we were able to go play at the Town Square park. When the whole family was bored, we went and saw a movie at the AMC theater. We had planned to spend the whole day just doing GameWorks, but quickly discovered that it wasn't entertaining enough for an entire day, so I'm glad that we had all the other Town Square options to choose from."}
{"text":"This place is a zoo. It's loud and dark and very very busy. The food is mediocre. It's a difficult place to keep track of kids. They do have a lot of TVs if you want to watch sports."}
{"text":"A joke. Took my son and literally a quarter of the games we tries to play were broken in some way. As expensive as games are today, save your money for someplace that maintains its games."}
{"text":"Hey, these guys deserve 5*. They have a great selection of games. They also have an electronic gaming room for video games, nice pinball section, a nice carnival style type games as well.  The place is clean, including the bathrooms. We were there for about three hours and there was someone going around cleaning up the floors the whole time.  We were on our way to the airport, so Corinne offered to keep our luggage in the bowling alley section where there is a security camera. How great is that? You don't find that kind of service at most family arcades.  We love any arcades, and have been to so many different ones in different cities, and this has to be one of the better ones all around.  On Sundays they have unlimited play for families for 995 per person, which includes a free large pizza. We got the Groupon which was $20 for all day unlimited gaming. Any other video arcade would've set us back at least triple this amount.  Thank you Corinne and staff again for your great customer service and kindness."}
{"text":"Very very meh. My son wanted to leave before I asked him too. At least 7 games didn't work, weren't turned on or had bad joysticks or bad calibration. The ticket basketball game started but didn't have any basketballs!!!   The selection of games is very poor. They had several riding/driving games. And they were the standard run of the mill fast and the furious type. There was one that the steering wheel was stuck and we couldn't play it because we couldn't steer. Wasted money on that one. The other ones we played the steering was too loose and you ended up all over the place but not on the course.   The only race game worth it was Mario Kart.   There was three fighting games. Tekken was good as always. Marvel vs Capcom machine was shot. The screen was messed up and couldn't be played. Didn't even get to play. Street Fighters joysticks were busted and couldn't be used to do anything but random forward and back.   Pinball machines were meh. Ghostbusters was the highlight here. The Game of Thrones one was missing it's glass panel where the artwork goes.   The hunting shooting games didn't seem calibrated. Also we inserted our cards in the cabella big game hunt game and the system rebooted and we lost our credits. Just walked away from that one.   The Star Wars flight simulator thing was pretty bad ass. Me and my some both like it. He was shocked that when you take off a little puff and wind hits ur face."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  My son (5 yrs old) always has a blast. And, so do we.  There are no tickets or tokens like CEC, just a nifty little Gamecard that you add money to and tracks your points.  Plus, the toys/gifts are 1000 times better than CEC.  I love they have a bar and am always sure to treat myself.  Plus I love that they are in TownSquare so you can make an entire day and have lunch, shop, play, even see a movie.  My only complaint is that we do end losing money in broken games.  It is a little chaotic because they are so busy, but we have always had a good experience regardless because staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"I don't like this new gameworks! Aside from the fact that I lost my points from the old gameworks, I decided to give it a second chance  Very pricey  Boring games!  One photo booth,  and extremely pricey!  The price redemption area is kind of cool, its like a little shop,   It is a huge \"improvement\" in technology and actual bowling,  but I miss the old school side of it all n_n    Didnt even try the bar as the people tending it ignored me and my husband and dismissed us,"}
{"text":"We had a work party in the e sports area. The staff were extremely helpful and so easy to work with in planning and when we arrived. The place was festive and most importantly the food and drink was good and plentiful.  Our average age is 40 and everyone had a blast. Some people were playing games for the first time and the staff made sure they learned how to use the controls in a fun and patient way.  We had a last minute conflict so our numbers were suddenly fewer than expected but they worked with us and we were very happy with how the party turned out.  We will return!"}
{"text":"Hmm...S-U-C-K-S!!  A lot of the games didn't even work. Then when we found one that did, the game did not dispense tickets.   It's just GROSS...enough said"}
{"text":"Review of the New GameWorks Las Vegas by Mother of three boys.  I signed up online for GameWorks rewards program a week before we left on our trip and received a free $10 game play in my email inbox (sweet) My first impression of the new town square location was that the shopping center had plenty of parking and high end shops and out door play spaces for kids. Inside the Facility seems much cleaner, and brighter than the old basement style location on the strip, that we had visited for years prior to it closing.  This location seems much less busy right at the opening versus in the afternoon hours on the weekends.  The Party/Restaurant area: We had drove from out of state to celebrated my oldest' s birthday here. Birthday parties have many options like: dedicated packages with your own room or u can reserve a table in the restaurant area.  We chose a table and added balloons, Andre was our server. I remember this because he was just so friendly and attentive! I felt like we were his only party.. Which we were not!  There was two other large groups having parties the same time. It was not bad thou. There is no dedicated \"kids menu\". However we found the Pizza and GameWorks nachos are large enough for kids to share or for an adult as a meal. (The steak on the nachos was very tender and was flavorful.) Each of these seemed kid friendly and were a part of the Play and Eat combo menu (so you could have opted to get a 1 hour timed game card for about $2.99 more if you were coming outside a party package- plus $2 card activation if it's your first time getting a card).  However the other menu items are mostly adult game day kind of foods or high end restaurant type meals, that would be great for a night watching sports/ or a girls night out. Not a lot of options small kids ( like hotdogs, mac and cheese etc.) I am usually an avid \"Yelper\" and had been slightly concerned prior to our arrival, about food quality and service, due to some older reviewers. My mind was quickly changed!  I had to talk with the chef in advance of ordering because of food allergies and he was very professional and reassuring.  He said they had a new menu starting presidents day with several new items ( like mac and cheese balls), and that the kitchen had changed a lot since opening ( which happens a lot now that I think about restaurants I frequent). He was right that things must have changed, because the quality far exceeded the reviews I had read. I had no problem getting food everyone could eat (despite allergies) and Andre refilled my drink 4 times in the 40 mins. we sat to eat.         Inside the Arcade: Family friendly atmosphere; Plenty of room for our stroller. We even saw a few double strollers while we were there! The family bathroom has a koala changing station. However no place within this bathroom to toss a dirty diaper, other than the tiny hand towel basket? (Hopefully they invest in a solution in the future) For kids of all ages; The game floor seems to consist of several \"zones\": Many large ride on/in games, A row of bloody shoot up games , Massive flashy ticket games, A \"eSports\" LAN room which is quiet, dark and filled with a gamers wildest dreams worth of P.Cs and gaming systems, and lastly the bowling ally ( which I will go into more detail on later). GameWorks did not disappoint with more than enough things to keep everyone entertained for five amazing hours that just flew by. We had so much fun on the floor with timed cards we returned on the 15th for a second day, to allow for time in the eSports room for my older boys.  eSports/ Bowling Alley: I inquired about the package options here as well for his party next year, and decided that's what we will plan for, for next time because of the value and option of pc based games like Minecraft.  While here they spent 2 hours playing diablo 3 and mine craft. Overall all boys had to be dragged out in the end they were having such a good time, look forward to many visits in years to come!"}
{"text":"Food was good BUT the attitude from the server was disappointing. My husband ordered a Stella, she brought a Sam Adams. No problem, let her know and then waited over 15 minutes for a replacement - which also was not a Stella (not that she waited to find out). Sent that back and ordered a Bud Light - which came once we were halfway through the meal. Then when it was time for the check, we had to wait even longer for them to remove the Stella we never got from the check. As if we hadn't been inconvenienced enough. And had there been an ounce of service, an apology, a recognition of the error - this review would not be posted. There are a million restaurants with decent food here - but when the service is below average it means we will not return."}
{"text":"This place has great discounts on drinks and appetizers most likely to drive business. $3.50 wells and beers such as Stella Artois are a win! My friends ordered nachos but they didn't look like they liked them much. Bartender as others are saying did seem slower.   In terms of an arcade venue, the space is massive and seems like they devoted too much room for restaurant as opposed to adding more games; possibly a bigger bowling alley with more lanes. I did not get to check out the LAN they had setup; next time!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome place once you get over the sewage spill odor that wafts up to assault you as soon as you head down the escalator. Not that little kids would care...  We luckily stopped by Tix4Tonight shack down the block and picked up a discount for the unlimited hour of gaming. $13 for an hour of all the Dance Dance Revolution, shooting games, and general arcade games you can fit in. Not a shabby system since you're given a card that swipes at all the machines and it keeps track of how much play time you experience rather than just a simple countdown from when you first swipe. We definitely fit in a lot of DDR action, blasted zombies, and then finished off with motorcycle racing."}
{"text":"This place has potential to be a great location for family fun, however, the lack of service (extremely slow) and the quality of food is much to be desired. I had a party of 5 and we got seated quickly but it took no kidding 10-15 min for a server to come to our table.  After a bit you just stop asking for things because it takes so long. The layout of where the dining in relation to the kitchen or service booth is too spread out. This place has the starting of a good thing but I probably won't come back. The first time I gave them the benefit of doubt but the second trip pretty much made the decision for me that this is how gameworks operates. So, in my opinion just come here for the games don't come here for the food. It's just not worth it."}
{"text":"This review is for the Glacier Bar that is attached to Game Works.   We walked by this place multiple times while in Vegas and they advertised the coldest beer in town. We bit one day and decided to stop in for a quick \"Snack\". The bar is actually accessed either through stairs/escalators from the sidewalk out front or through the lower level of Game Works itself.   The bar is pretty small, and despite the name, it's pretty warm down there. I will say that we had the nicest and one of the cutest bartenders while we were there. Tiffany, was amazing! She was prompt, entertaining, personable and even made some custom drinks for us.   It's a neat little bar, and worth the stop. The prices weren't bad for Vegas and it's kind of a novelty. I will warn you that getting out is a little more difficult as you have to go into Gameworks and use their elevators to get back up."}
{"text":"Fun place for drinks, bar food and games with your friends and family. Kids come here for the games too! You play for a card loaded with the amount of tokens of your choice then you swipe your card on the card reader to pay for the games! It eliminates the need to carry change and all your tickets are loaded onto the card too!   A wide variety of games from ski ball to basketball, house of the dead to pin balls!"}
{"text":"Yeah a 3 rating sounds about right. The older location had more soul and passion. Albeit a fighting game or driving around.   I love SEGA from the get go in the late 80's when I used to buy games from Tatget. Lol  Now their games have dwindled and the competition isn't there any more. Although it looks like they have a new LAN center to hang out at. I have yet to bring my joystick with me to this.   The food is the exact same menu as the old place. Same OL same ol."}
{"text":"We ventured down here from Centennial as a last hoorah before back to school.  We had a good time on all the interactive games that were for the most part easy to understand and play for the little ones.  I do think that they could have used a few more pieces of equipment.  I understand that many of these machines cost as much as your moms Hyundai.  These machines are also very tempermental and see nothing but abuse from these super nerds who live in solitarey confinement playing Xbox 360 and only come out for cheesy gordita crucnches from Taco bell and a new Maxim magazine to masturbate to.    This is a tough crowd to please.  My suggestion would have been to put in a Jack In the Box for gamer dietary needs, instead of another sub par restaurant with high prices.  This is the last thing Las Vegas needed.  You could have used that huge dining space to put in more revenue..... or credit generators. Gameworks you are located in one of the highest rent districts in all of Las Vegas.  You have come up with away to quickly ROI for the $500,000 in equipment you purchased.  Take a lesson from the nightclub industry the way to make money is on the booze.  Bottle Service!!! and VIP AREA!!!  The funnest game they had was the Pac Man air hockey.  We could have played this the whole time.  We will be back. It might be a while but we will.  Good luck to you Gameworks.  I appreciate what you bring to the valley, unlike all the other HATER SUPER GEEKS out there."}
{"text":"This is for the arcade only I did not eat there so my old review on the pizza is the same.  The arcade was Very clean this time.   Most  of the machines were in working order. Staff was very friendly and responsive when we used  a game that was broken. We went on a dark 3D game which is an additional fee it  was very cool and felt like we got our money's worth.   I saw a big improvement over the last time I was there.   I hope they improved their food and next time I'm there I'll try their kitchen again."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!  First off it took awhile for us to be seated, on a Sunday afternoon with the restaurant with 3 tables occupied. The booths were ripped open. It took forever for the waitress to order our drinks. I was watching her like a hawk, she would be standing in the back drinking her soda. Walk around and never acknowledge anyone and walk back to her soda. I would expect more from a much older lady than the \"children\" running the place.    Never order the hot wings or fish and chips. The wings tasted like microwaveable wings. Horrible! It's like they never changed the fryer oil.  I went to the ladies room, HORRIBLE! The stalls are all broken! The doors hardly lock. Graffiti on the stalls. The floor is always wet. Smelled really bad! The trash can is literally a cardboard box with a bag in it. Seems as if no one attends the bathrooms, most of the toilets either don't flush or clogged.   I didn't bother for the games after eating. It's like $3 just for the card itself.  Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I don't understand why it has bad reviews at all. This place is so fun and great for both kids and adults! There's a bar in here, they server food, and though it's a little pricey, it's worth every dime! It's a great idea for a night out with your friends. You can just drink and enjoy time with your friends! I recommend coming here. It's right next to the theater and Guitar Center!"}
{"text":"Came for the midnight event for League of Legends world finals..  Extremely organized event, unlimited gaming with the purchase of the event ticket, and free food.  Count me in!  The company is always adding new games.  Last time I went there (last week), I found a new Kung Fu Panda game which was ridiculously fun.    There's a pretty good computer/lan center that hosts video game and computer game tournaments.  I'm pretty sure they do Hearthstone tournaments every other Sunday.  The one thing I'm still wondering is when I signed up for \"four free hours\" of computer time during the midnight League of Legends of event, I never received those free hours the next time I came back.    Other than that, there are a good amount of games to win tickets and the prizes are great if you have a kid.  I've already won a giant care bear for my daughter.  Finally, almost forgot, there is bowling.  I believe there were 8 lanes.  The games are not expensive and you can order food there.     Great place for kids and adults."}
{"text":"Was here for my husbands birthday with family and friends. Best service from Jerred. Great food...great atmosphere!!! Will be coming back again"}
{"text":"Now if this review was written over 5 years ago this place was amazing and would have gotten 5 stars. Fast forward to today, it's kind of dissapointing. They have a small selection of Japanese games such as ddr, pop n music, guitar hero etc. The problem is they got rid of a lot of them and my favorite purikura machine. Not to mention most of these are broken from having no regular maintenance. There have plenty of games that you could find anywhere and they have good deals on thursday. I gave this 3 stars because I still have fun when I go here but I could be so much better."}
{"text":"I didn't buy the pass.  Partially because I'm a cheap bitch, partially cuz I figured if i wanted to play anything, I could be a mooch. I've never been much of a gamer, more of a voyeur than anything, so i figured I'd just watch.  Sometimes watching can be way more fun. So I just cruised around with my really tall half yard of Heffeweisen, which was poured by the worlds slowest bartender, and drank it out of a straw.    This is what i saw and did:  I watched Christopher get denied any sort of privilege for working for SEGA. I watched people play a bad version of Guitar Hero. I watched people play Mario Kart with pictures of themselves replacing the princess and Yoshi I watched zombies get killed. I watched Todd beat NishisHot at Dance Dance Revolution. I watched cars crash. I rode on the back of StanK's motorcycle. I got to play doubles in air hockey and win, lose singles to Eric, and then when I was finally going to win one on one, I got to break the machine.  Beep.  Beep. Beep. Error. Beep. Beep. Beep. Error. I watched Carla react to the constant smell of fart.  Apparently in Vegas, there is a reason we try to stay away from places that kids go.  Man, do they stink!  Stay in the adult areas.  You are better off."}
{"text":"This is a great place for kids of all ages to play a wide variety of arcade games, ranging from high-end video games (sit inside of a capsule, with wrap-around screens) right down to those silly games you find at other venues that spit out paper tickets you can redeem for nearly worthless prizes.  Needless to say, there's something here for everyone, including even gaming consoles!  If you're there over mealtime, there's also a bar and a full-service restaurant within the facility.  We didn't partake at the bar, so I'll leave that for others to review.  The food was average at best, and the although the hostess and waitstaff were friendly, it was very clear that none of them were enthusiastic about being there.  Even with a lot of open tables, it took over 30 minutes to seat our party, and when they did, the tables were cleared but still dirty.  It appeared everyone wanted to be working somewhere else, or not at all.  This strikes me as odd since GameWorks is located in Town Square and is essentially surrounded by other dining options.  With average food and below average staff, and access to a big variety of food within just a few minutes walking distance, it seems GameWorks might want to stick to its primary purpose and make better use of the space by putting in a small snack bar, and using the rest of the floor space for more games.  I'll definitely go back with my son to play more games, but we won't eat there again.  No point paying the price for decent food but being served mediocre food when there are so many other options right there.  So go to game, not to eat."}
{"text":"Meh!  Came here for the 1st time today to see if it would be a good option for a birthday party.  Boy, was I disappointed!  About a third of the games did not work!  It is pricey, but my kids love the games so I wasn't worried too much about the cost.  This place is quite small, I was expecting something larger.  From reading the reviews, they obviously don't care about fixing their games.  The place seemed clean though, employees nice, but detached and worried about taking selfies with giant stuffed animals."}
{"text":"Had an awesome time here. :) food was nomm, wings, nachos and not to mention the smores dessert! The staff here is always friendly, attentive and it is clear that they love their job. That speaks volumes about the management here - love coming here and will return soon!"}
{"text":"This place has a LONG way to go before it's worth the money, so I will spare them the one star review....for now. This location is about 1/3 the size of their others.  The Seattle location puts this place to shame.  We got two hours of free play, but half the games were not working.   I paid $54 for 400 credits for future use.  The menu looks appetizing, but way too expensive.  I got one draft beer and it was $7!  The best part of this location?  It is right across the sidewalk from Yard House.  We will likely use GameWorks as entertainment for our kids while my wife and I hit happy hour at Yard House.  Unless they come up with a happy hour with major discounts, I will never buy food or drink here.  Without drastic improvements this location will become the hangout for kids waiting for their movie at AMC, and that will mean once my 400 credits run out, my card will be permanently filed in the circular canister."}
{"text":"My husband and I travel here from Tucson occasionally because they're one of very few places that has Japanese music-game consoles, including Beatmania IIDX, Pop'n Music, and Guitar Freaks/DrumMania. On a weekend afternoon, the place isn't nearly as busy as you'd expect it to be, and even though there are lots of lights and noise and little kids running amok, it's not too bad.  Would be nice if they brought back the time-based passes ($X gets you 2 hours of unlimited play) since the music games are about $1/play, but still can't complain."}
{"text":"6/29 We came to Game Works for some food and to play a few games before going to the movies. The food here is not bad, we did the food and play special which allows your unlimited games for the amount of time you choose.  Now, the arcade portion isn't the best or the worst; there are enough cool games to go around, some classics and a few epic gaming machines."}
{"text":"My kids LOVED this place! So this review is for them. Me on the other hand am not into video gaming so thank god this place was attached to a mall. We went on a Tuesday w our Vegas POGO passes. A POGO pass is a pass we purchased online before we hit up Vegas. It includes a bunch of kid activities for a small fee of $40 per person. This place was on the list so we came and my kids stayed for hours AND hours. Since game works was so quiet my kids stayed in the gaming room for well passed the one hour allotment. He loved it! All the staff there were friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"Saw a Groupon special for these guys. 20 bucks for an all day play card plus a 10 dollar gift card. I immediately grabbed 2 of them for my 2 boys ages 13 and 10. Thought it was an awesome deal until we showed up on a saturday. Yes I can understand that it was gonna be busy because of the fact that it was a saturday but that's not my gripe.  My gripe is that a lot of the games were not working. I would say about 40 percent were out of order. Even some of the newer games like the tank one my youngest noticed you can only go forward and cannot reverse so he was stuck behind a wall the whole game not able to do anything but get shot at. Another gripe is that other parents had the same idea so of course my kids had to wait for their kids to get off a game once they ran out of lives but in most cases, they would just keep swiping their card basically just hogging the game the whole time. There should be some kind of limit on how many times you can continue on an all day play pass for they can literally stay on a game the whole day which is rude in my opinion.  I also understand that since we had the unlimited play card it wouldnt generate any game tickets for obvious reasons. This did not bother me at all. Again, since some of the games were out of order, the kids tried to make the most of it. Even the standard interactive games like the basketball shot one only 4 out of the 6 was working but technically only 2 was worthy of playing due to those having a decent amount of balls to play with while the others had only 2 or 3. Looking around I saw some of the balls were stuck on top of the actual arcade.   After about 90 minutes of playing the same games over and over again my kids were bored already to the point they just wanted to go home. Memo to the Gameworks staff. Dont you guys have some kind of technician that is on the clock repairing those games that are broke? At least a person that can keep the basketballs in order on the basketball arcade?  I am so disappointed from our visit that I dont see any reason to come back here. You guys should change your name to \"Gameswork\". Because after coming here I am left scratching my head thinking do any of the \"Games Work?\"  Yelp 2015 Review #36 \"Gameworks?.........Sometimes.\" 535 overall"}
{"text":"Guess this place just has a fun play around vibe. I'm comparing it to a place I used to go to that had games & food but was a hot spot to hang out at night! Took my 10 year old boy cousin and he had a LOT of fun!! From racing/shooting games to the ticket games! But the prizes were kinda ticketed too high for what my cousin could get on $20. Maybe kinda lower some of the prize ticket amounts an it would be good for the kids to want to come back. But this time around..was good!  Went on a Thursday night. It was in the summer so it was very full with both kids and adults having fun. But my experience wasn't anything to brag about. I'm a huge games playing girl (went to fun factory - hawaii growing up) but gameworks was soooo nothing to love. Like I have no desire to go back..even if I had nothing to do. The layout was horrible. The food sitting area felt bigger then the games area! I think there was only 2 games that I wanted to play that was working. All the others were \"out of service\". Gameworks has only been open maybe a week when I went..why were the games broken? The whole design just felt like it was just put there..no thought put into the interior design. Very poor as a game fun center..didn't make it fun! Boo..bring a dave n busters!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar at around 10ish had the bartender Geovany absolutely terrible service. The moment we got to the bar the bartender didn't even acknowledge us we ordered two beers and a few items from the happy hour menu.   The food was great we got the sliders and the quesadillas. On the second round of drinks we ordered around 11:34PM the bartender took our order and didn't serve us until everyone else on the table was served.   I keep going back to service but the only reason I'm even writing"}
{"text":"38 minutes after ordering we finally got our appetizers. Ordered Sriracha fries, got parmesan. Another 10 minutes for new fries. Here they come. Sriracha? Nope. Plain. Not going to send them back again. Granted, the fries, even plain were good fries. The chicken wings were delicious, got 3 flats, no drummettes. The mozzarella cheese sticks were delicious. Perfectly seasoned. Did not need any marinara. Stuffed fried raviolis were not good imo. I can't explain it just that the beef didn't taste like beef. Chicken fingers were good. Grilled cheese was good but the quesadillas were dissappointing. The potstickers were good in flavor but maybe need a little longer in the fryer as the inside was cool and mushy. The fish and chips were perfect. Wish they had tartar sauce or malt vinegar to go with but they don't. Our server brought us an aioli sauce that was pretty tasty with the fish. We ordered waffle fries to go with it but they were really hard. I recommend sticking with regular fries. Also, I want to point out that our server Courtnie was courteous and polite and when I sent back the parmesan fries, I asked her not to take the entire platter of apps back with her so we could start eating as we were starved. As we were asking for our bill, a large party of about 9 people were seated next to us. By the time we paid our check and we're leaving, maybe 15-20 minutes, they were already eating. Not sure why we were unlucky to have to wait so long.   Games: 40% of the games we wanted to play were out of order. We played the Pacman air hockey game a few times and it was great fun but when we went back to play it again it was out of order. Sucks because my daughter is limited to what she can play due to being in a wheelchair. Lots of the games require you to transfer into a seat or are on a platform that isn't accessible and those that aren't were limited due to so many being out of order. I was happy to see Pinball machines and show my kids how to play it. I believe there were 6 machines but only 3 were working properly. We ended up leaving with 416 minutes of unlimited play still on our card."}
{"text":"Okay before i start this let me say that I AM glad that gameworks is back.  After nearly 3 years i really really....REALLY missed having it around.  Now let me begin...  First off, this place was a bigger letdown than i could've ever imagined. There couldn't possibly be any more than 45 arcade games on the game floor. The space that could be used to fit more game machines is currently taken up by over-optimistic restaurant space, unused party/banquet rooms and fancy looking walls. As it is at any gameworks a nice percentage of games were broken....but the difference between this gameworks and the others is that there's not much else to choose from....remember there's not even 50 machines on the floor which leads to my next complaint....a 2-3 person line to play literally any game on the floor. I'm not one to complain about waiting his turn, but this is a first for me at a gameworks. Arcade favorites like sonic the fighters, afterburner climax, marvel vs. Capcom, mortal kombat, street fighter, need for speed, f1 Ferrari challenge, and many many others are all MISSING from the roster. They used to be at the gameworks on the strip....i just don't understand why they wouldn't be here. The ticket/prize games are usually separated at most gameworks locations. Since this one is soooo tiny, they all just blend together. The prize redemption area is soooo small. I was tripping over small children and a couple of large, buff, angry dudes. Very uncomfortable...i never even got to choose my prize. More tickets for next time i suppose... Oh, and gamer beware. Many games will deduct points and the game will never acknowledge that you payed. Luckily the managers were able to see the cards swipe history and refund the card. in comparison to any other gameworks in the country....This game floor gets an F.   The e-sports room is passable....literally...you can pass right by it and not even notice it's there. Its a decent price to rent an xbox and tv but honestly the game roster is small. I'm not sure if you can bring your own or not. Theres a total of 4 stations with televisions. Imho they should have at least 7 or 8 but that's just my two cents. They have a 60pc lan party...which is 40 less than what was advertised last year. Which reminds me...they told us on the gameworks facebook and website that there would be a laser tag arena.....which...there is none. Very disappointing. The e-sports will definitely bring in revenue. It just needs more games and console/tv stations. The e-sport section gets a C.  The bowling ally and pool table area is nice. And it has its own bar which is cool since you don't have to leave to goto the game floor for a drink. You rent your shoes at the door. The alley lanes are very narrow compare to say...the station casinos. They're basically miniature bowling lanes....i haven't played on the lanes yet so its not really fair for me to review it. Id say a B just because it exists.  Lastly, the overall service and restaurant. I didn't eat at the restaurant yet...and i don't believe i ever will. Allow me to explain. I asked the bartender at the bowling center for a glass of water. He immediately tells me itll be \"a while\" before he can serve me the water. Which is fine....note that he had a group of 3 people to serve before me and as soon as he was done serving them...\"a while\" never came for me. No biggie. I guess good service is reserved for paying bar patrons. After spending 100 on points (which is ridiculous. I've never spent more than 40 bucks at any gameworks and i usually get hours of entertainment!) you'd think you would be treated half as decently as a hole in the wall bar. Later on i noticed i was hungry and i wanted something light, so i grabbed some wetzels pretzels which isn't far from gameworks.....BIG MISTAKE. I was just about halfway through my pretzel and walking back into gameworks when i was met with the most absurd statement: \"we don't allow outside food. Sorry.\" excuse me? I just spent how much money.....to play broken games?! I'm sure you wont mind if i finish my pretzel while i walk through your precious, oversized restaurant past your pitiful, undersized gamefloor, and get in my car. Service gets a D.   Worst gameworks experience I've ever had. I have been going to various gameworks locations since i was 9 years old. I'm 26 now. I've never seen anything like this. It's as if they only care about making money. I wish sega never sold gameworks to espn. I hope this helps them make better decisions in the future and fall back to their former glory! Long live gameworks!    i give them six months to add more games before i write them off my hangout spots list."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for my children and myself ($20 unlimited all-day play) in hopes of having a great time and a good lunch. I was here last year and it was not this run down. I don't know what happened but everything is in disrepair. A good third of the games are broken and all but 1 of the urinals are not in service. A good portion if the games that were operational were unplayable because the \"targets\" on the guns would bounce all over the place. (Photos attached) My daughter ordered the baked mac & cheese ($11) and it was underwhelming at best. A shallow layer of macaroni swimming in some bullshit fake cheese. (See photo) Don't waste your money here, they don't care about this place, neither should you."}
{"text":"There are way too many ticket machines which require no skill and attract little kids to use up all their quarters! I wish all the games gave tickets so they would actually play games besides ticket machines! A lot of machines were out of order. There were so many people in there you had to wait to get a turn on most games. This was Sat. at 4:00 p.m.-5:30. This place is just prepping young kids to throw away their money in hopes of hitting the 500 ticket pay out! Sound like Vegas to you?  They serve alcohol, that's a plus! They have a few bowling lanes, and kids loved that! At least they played something. They also have a small video game room with some game system for older kids. I didn't check that out much, and have no idea how long that's been there. The food is very good here. Plan on spending a lot of money if you take a few kids here at once. It's cheaper to purchase one or two large play cards than purchasing 5 different ones. So we got two and had the teens swipe for the 10 year olds. No matter how the adults feel, this is heaven for kids!"}
{"text":"Dante is the man. Knowledgeable, helpful, and overall cool guy. Go here for all your gaming needs and questions."}
{"text":"FIX YOUR EQUIPMENT!!  Its bad enough you over charge for games, but for it to not work and then wait in line for a credit....  UGH!"}
{"text":"They gotta do better. With everything. Service. Food. Prices. The games. Literally half the game don't work. The staff fixing them tells me he doesn't know when it's gonna be fixed. The basketballs at he basketball game is all flat. They wouldn't refill my card when a game charged me and didn't even let my kids play. Oh. And they charge a liver and a kidney for a small quesadilla. Terrible service. Just terrible"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot, however I had a bad experience with an extremely rude bartender, a woman with shaved sides and an black/teal ombré whom I guess was offended from my question which was... \"The bill was $18 right? And I gave you $25?\"   In which her response automatically was \"Oh so you weren't giving me a $5 tip?\" Which turned me off because in all honesty I didn't like her tone or the way she was looking at me. Like I was ignorant or something.  I said \"Actually it would have been a $7 tip\"  Which wasn't a problem, I'm literally keeping track of how much cash I spend. But when you get nasty attitudes then I no longer care about how you feel or what you say.   And before I could finish what I'm trying to say she starts going on a rant about how usually people just give her $7 if the bill is $18 and if the bill was $15 people hand her $22.. okay that's cool and all however that's not what I asked you nor did I say anything about the amount of your tip I was asking how much cash I gave you.   Then she continues on about bartending and tips I had to interrupt her because I've bartended too, I'm also a hairstylist and never do I ASSUME people are going to tip certain amounts because sometimes they don't and I don't get upset when people ask me how much cash they gave me. I just give them the answer.   Some of the machines are broken my fiancé swiped his card and lost points for it.   Anyway the manager is nice however we probably won't come back here. Which sucks for me cause I like gameworks back where I'm from and wanted to come back and bring people.  Julius was so nice though!!!"}
{"text":"The Dine & Play for $14.99 includes 1 entree (there are a few to choose from) and 1 hour of arcade game play. It's a great deal. We ordered 2 of these Dine & Play - which was enough to feed myself and the 2 boys.   Pizza was limp, crust not cooked well enough. Blah. Nachos topped with steak is pretty good!  The boys played arcade for an hour, while I headed to the Bowling room and sat at the bar. The hour seemed to go by pretty fast with a couple of beers."}
{"text":"SO EXPENSIVE! Lol if you go here .. Bring a lot of money!! Btw the prizes are also so expensive you need to get a lot of tickets to get a stuff animal !!! Not really worth spending your money here tho.."}
{"text":"Decided to keep kids busy between basketball tournaments. This place is located in the back of Town Square. Plenty of parking and entry is in the front AND back.   Tables in the dining area were nearly empty. Service was still almost nonexistent! When the waitress did come by, she was very laissez faire. She took orders and some items never came. We were rarely checked on in the few hours there. We didn't get the bill until we asked for it. As infrequently as we got serviced, the waitress is lucky we are honest people!   Food is nothing to rave about. Typical quick fried and cooked food: burgers, fries, pizza, appetizers, salads... Plenty of tvs played sports. Plentynof tables for large groups. Side bar area for adults.  Game room is a bit stuffy. Games could be updated. One side room has a few bowling lanes. Another is dimly lit, quiet, and has computers for virtual game play. Kids loved it."}
{"text":"Pretty neat place. Arcade, bar, bowling, and even karaoke all in one. Only downside tons of children and teenagers everywhere. My friends and I came here for happy hour I believe 9-midnight and it was pretty decent. Happy hour beers were I believe $3 and appetizers $5-$10. We got the mozzarella sticks , pretzel bites, and nachos. Everything was a shareable size between 2 people. The mozzarella sticks and nachos were pretty standard. I like the pretzel sticks but there wasn't enough cheese and if you let them sit too long they became a little tough. Also they have a 8 lane bowling alley. No one was in there besides us so it was a very private experience. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"I want to give this a five star rating based on the games but I can't since their food is awful! I got very sick after eating their nachos. 7/11 has better nachos then here. My husband ordered the wings. They were over cooked and were frozen before being cooked.   Paid $4.00 for a fountain soda! Can you say way over priced! I recommend only playing the games they have .. However they need more current ones.  Guess I'm spoiled by Dave & Busters. These 2 don't compare!"}
{"text":"This is actually a rating for the restaurant. Our waitress was super nice. Food comes in huge portion, so if your really not that hungry, I'd stick with appetizers, or split a meal. But, if you are hungry, anything on the menu in this place will fill you up for sure. Love their Oreo shake. yum yum yummmm! I could totally go for an oreo shake right now."}
{"text":"So I've been here before and it's ok. Does get pretty crowded. I came here on another occasion when it was slower. My BF and I were playing a game and a lady approached and set her child down on the game next to us. He started crawling over to get to our game.. He even picked up our balls and while playing this fast paced game I hit him with my elbow. Complete accident. I did not think this lady was partially challenged enough to allow her child to run wild. I told her to move her child or it'll happen again, he's not my responsibility. She threw back some shade, so I told her to learn to be a mother. Later my BF and I are at the bar and he is standing next to me. The lady came by as if she was about to exit. She took her styrofoam cup and threw her drink on my BF. I got up and threatened her damn life. We called management and he had said she is here almost everyday and let's her kid run around and he felt too bad to kick her out. Mind you, she isn't paying to play ANYTHING. End of story, he comped us some games and the bartender was cool enough to comp us a drink. Well, I'm here right now and she's still here doing the same thing. So if you're homeless or broke feel free to lurk around here and not spend money. Oh and bring all your kids so they feel bad and let you stay!"}
{"text":"Been to this place twice to eat and play the games.  The game part is fine my issue is with the service with food, first of all the menu is weak , selections of food are poor the salads are gross more lettuce than meat.  The second time we came i thought my meal was better than the first time I came however the waiter was horrible hardly came over to the table we sat for 15mins waiting for another drink and another 15 mins for silverware. Then we just wanted our bill and this guy was no where to be found.   Obviously I should learn but my two first choices of where to eat had no availability .   I will try My hardest not to come back here.   And if a manager reads this. Have yr staff get it together."}
{"text":"I have been to a large amount of lan centers/gaming cafes, but non like this. There was a lot of the same stuff in which you would see at other places, but the service itself really outshined any other place that I have been too. Dante made the experience something special with his knowledge of games and ability to assist with any questions my friend and I had. Truly an amazing experience."}
{"text":"RJ the cashier in the front was very helpful. He explained how the games worked.  He made our experience on New Years Eve especially memorable.  The customer service and was exceptional.  He helped me make my less afraid of a 3D ride.  Thanks Game Works Management Team! You have a great host in the front in RJ!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"The prices are great and there's a good selection of games to play. We stuck around for about an hour and had a great time. My only complaint is that a lot of the games here need to be repaired. Several games were either out of service or would malfunction mid game."}
{"text":"Oh man, I'm torn on this place.   I used to go to the GameWorks on the Strip when I was kid. I mean, I even remember going to the original grand opening and losing mind because it was so amazing, two stories of video games! That's a lot for a 14-year-old boy to handle. Now this new GameWorks location is in Town Square and it's not like the one of yesteryear, but more of a sports bar fused with a Chuck E. Cheese.   They added a few new things like a full bowling alley, which looks amazing, a huge bar for the alcoholic pinball lovers, and a few hundred TVs. I like the lay out here also; there are two main entrances on each side of the building, which is super convenient, and the length of the bar is great because I don't like feeling like I'm sitting on the guy next to me. The have an okay mix of games, but I feel like they need to incorporate more of the classics. They have \"Donkey Kong\" and \"Centipede\", plus a few others, but this isn't enough of the old school favorites. I hate to say it, but my age and demo will be the main customers frequenting this place and if you don't up the nostalgia factor here you might be setting yourself up for the ultimate, GAME OVER. The other side of this is most \"little\" kids or hardcore gamers would rather stay in their room and play \"Call of Duty\" with some other kid from Germany. They don't want to be bothered with socializing or paying for something they already have at home. I'm voting for Super Mario 3!  Once I was done playing Skee-Ball and destroying some T-1000s on the Terminator shooter game I needed something in my belly. I still had stuff to do that day so I ordered a Cesar salad and some fries, you know...keeping it lite. These were good by \"Barcade\" standards. The salad was big and fresh and the french fries came with this cocktail sauce infused ketchup, pretty tasty! Of course I had to order a cocktail before I left, \"One Moscow Mule please\". (keeping it lite) This was actually the shining light of my visit. Sweet, tangy, and refreshing with just enough vodka and ginger.   All in all, it was an OK experience and I feel like they are still working out some of the kinks, hence the three star rating. It's definitely not the GameWorks that was stuck in my memory, but I will be back to give it a second chance. Plus, who else will dominate all the little kids on the Pac-Man Air Hockey game."}
{"text":"I would originally give them 3 stars but after taking advantage of their new deal they offer on Thursdays, I would definitely say 4 stars! This deal I'm talking about is $10 for UNLIMITED game playing from 5pm-Close on Thursdays! Awesome! I feel like they read everyone's mind because it would always be kind of pricey to play before, I feel like $20 goes so fast here and I bet that's true for a lot of parents as well. So Thursdays is the way to go! The only catch is that the games that offer tickets, well you can still play them but they don't give you tickets. Makes sense, $10 is such a steal and then you get free prizes too? No way haha That's no problem for me since I don't really care about the prizes but that definitely could be an issue for the little ones.  My favorites are the football throwing game, skeeball, air hockey, mario kart and this other game that you knock down clowns with balls in an alotted amount of time. Also out of all of the games offered I think there were only 2 out of order so that's not too bad. As for the unlimited game play, you can't use your card at the photobooth but I didn't have a problem using it with anything else. Overall, I probably would only come here Thursdays now, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Reserved my sister's birthday party online a week and a half in advanced. To secure your booking, they call you and get your card info & charge you half of what's due for a deposit.   When they called me about the bowling party (it took a few times for us to finally get in touch) they asked me to pick two colors for party decor. 3 days before the party, they ask if we want to add any other guests or party platters.  The party was $25/kid and included 90 minutes of bowling, shoe rental, party decor, pizza, cookies, & soft drinks. Each person who RSVPd also got a one hour game card that they could start whenever they wanted, as long as it was the day of the party.   There was a lot of seating & tables for all of the guests. There was even a separate table for presents. Our party of ~20 kids got 3 lanes to bowl. The food that came with the package was good enough for the kids + a few parents. The only extra food we ordered were nachos.   Ebony was our server and she was so patient and friendly with our big group of 8-11 year olds.   A few things you should know: The party does not come with invites; however the manager Janai sent me their logo to work with for some 'DIY' invites. Their goodie bags are very pricey at $5/kid, but again, Janai kindly let us bring our own.   Overall, the experience was a fun one and I wouldn't have booked anywhere else this year."}
{"text":"The staff for the bar and the dining area is so terrible . I came here the first time and the waiter was very inattentive , my friends and I had to ask for everything , plus the plates and the silverware was still dirty . The second time I came here the bar tender seemed rude and didn't help me bring 4 drinks back to the bowling area . She couldn't even bring 4 of them to me at once and expected me to bring 4 to the bowling ally . Seriously , worst customer service I've ever had . If there was less than one star I'd give it to them ."}
{"text":"Came here today with some friends and I had a blast. I like that there's a lot of selection of games to pick from for everybody. Some of the machines were not working properly though, but it didn't hinder us too much."}
{"text":"Parking is $3 so either drop off or park at the mgm grand & walk thru (not far) towards Studio 54 & LV Blvd.  Make sure you keep your plastic card to reuse forever at any Gameworks or you get charged an activation fee & a $2 card fee.  We tried to put money on the card online to take advantage of the $10 free perk for doing online but it wouldn't work but luckily, David, the helpful manager took care of us as I had a birthday party for my son but didn't want to do the 10 people party plan.  The best is the $35 unltd all day  pass so try to stay up til 1am when they close or get the cheapest $79 (sometimes less) MGM room & hang out there!!!"}
{"text":"The sliders were the best I've tasted in a while! Real meat and a tangy sauce. the fisherman's platter was crunchy and the fillet was full. I didn't expect to get real food at an arcade but I was really pleased. My God daughter had a creamy macaroni and cheese with ham from the kids menu and we all had to eat some. Afterwards we worked our food off by playing arcade games with the kids. It was a blast"}
{"text":"This Gameworks location is great and is far better than almost any other arcade style restaurant venue anywhere near the vicinity of the Las Vegas area.  Of the comments by others that criticise this Gameworks, it is often that this location lacks some of the greatness of other or past Gameworks locations.  While some of that I agree with, the comparison should be Gameworks now compared to their competitors now, not Gameworks compared to themselves of the past.  The dining areas, bar areas, bowling areas, arcade areas, and the console gaming areas all look great.  The arcade prices generally are about four credits per game, which is one dollar with no promotions or bulk purchase of credits whatsoever.  Most generic arcades in the major hotels would have similar pricing, yet Gameworks provides a much nicer, friendlier and healthier enviroment than going inside a Las Vegas hotel/casino.  In addition, they have deals, 190 credits for $27, making that one-dollar game just 57 cents.  The pricing is good; I do not see where some of these complaints come from.  It is a far better value than Dave and Busters located throughout the country.  The Las Vegas design is different than many other Gameworks, but that is fine.  I personally do not understand the space given to console internet computer gaming, but that may appeal to others.  If that does not work out as expected, a great idea would be to expand the arcade space, which is what many arcade enthusiasts want to happen.  Maybe put in a clever time tunnel entrance and have some great, nearly forgotten games from the 80s and 90s in there that nearly no one has anymore (possibly locate a game list from when the first Gameworks opened, and replicate some of it).  If management wants an idea of games, I would be glad to submit some ideas, or go on killer list of videogames dot com for a blast from the past reminder of games that once existed.  Possibly, add a few more classic cabinets to overflow and transition between sections, so the place is not quite so compartmentalized.  All of this is not a complaint, just ideas to make this new Gameworks even better and enhance it with some classic nestalgia from Gameworks past.  In closing, Gameworks Las Vegas does not deserve an average rating less than four stars.  Those who live in the area should enjoy what it has to offer instead of comparing it to absolute arcade perfection.  Again, compare it to what little else is present in Las Vegas family fun, enjoy the games and the environment of fun that exists inside all Gameworks locations.  I do want to also mention that in my opinion many other Gameworks, current and past, deteriorated over time.  Please do not allow entropy to set in here, please keep the games well maintained and focus on customer service and Gameworks will do well."}
{"text":"I go here just for two things: the restaurant and the pool table. Their restaurant is thankfully located on the upper floor away from the madness downstairs (and the noise). Their best drink is the Choco-tini, yes chocolate with vodka. It really does work. A little expensive but if you're playing pool, you might as well. The crowd at the bar isn't trashy. They have good wings and American food. Good spinach dip. Been here lots of times. The two pool tables are almost always available.   Giving this place three stars because of the games. They took away many of the old school games. They used to have a shooting game where you went up three stories if you advanced in the game. They replaced them with a lot of the mechanical claw booths, a stupid photo booth and lots of games where you aim a coin onto squares and many many Dance Revolution mats. Sounds funny but I would like to see a shooting range put in or even a game like in Vegas' Excalibur where you bet on a mechanical dog. Many many years ago, they had a Jurassic Park ride. Even that sounds better than what they got now."}
{"text":"Horrible!  I came here at 10pm was told the kitchen was closed so I couldn't get my free meal hat was offered on my birthday coupon. Ok fine. However, servers were still taking orders and serving food. We went to the bar and sat down. A server named Elizabeth decided to serve everyone around me, even patron that walked up after. She looked right in our faces & chose to serve a patron that just walked up. I went down to the other end, and the manager had to tell someone to serve us. Really? After 15 minutes? The bar area was not that crowded. Overall, I will not be returning here. We left to go find a place that was willing to serve us food and drinks. There's no way I will spend another dime in this place. Horrible service!!!"}
{"text":"I mean, in theory, this place SHOULD be excellent. However, once you walk in you'll soon realize that the fun and enjoyment left this place a long time ago.   Came in here last Saturday night with a friend and we were looking to play some games and have some fun. Both her and I agreed that this place was very antiquated, dirty, overstaffed and underserved.   We walked upstairs to get a drink and had multiple staff members walk past us without acknowledging us even after making eye contact...while we were standing by the empty counter. Not cool. Took us a few minutes of standing there before we were finally served.   I made the mistake of going into the bathroom...and it was absolutely disgusting. I'll spare you the gory details, but trust and believe I would NEVER let my kids go into their facilities.  As for the games that are available to play... Very old and uninteresting. We had a pocket full of money and honestly didn't play a single game because there was hardly anything worthwhile.   There are other places, which will go unnamed, which provide the exact same services as GameWorks...I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Lots of fun and latest games.  We went to Groupon to find this place.  Kids played as long as they wanted for just $20 each!!!   They have a great friendly staff.  We went when they We're doing karaoke or something along those lines. Amateur singing that's all I know. I didn't get a chance to eat her food yet but overall a fun experience.  The two star review from Amanda. None of the games were broken actually everything was working. So I'm not sure what she's talking about there. I never ate anything yet so I can't say if the service was good or not. This place is not for tiny kids in my opinion. This is more for 4 years or older.  My 2 eight-year-old boys had a blast."}
{"text":"If you go there and play with a red card to earn tickets please keep track of how many you should have when you go redeem them. I've gone there twice and both times I've got ripped off from the machines. I played the bejewelled game and have won more than 1000 tickets (2x Tuesday) when I went to redeem them the machine did not upload them to my card... Had to argue with the manager and tell him the machine was not working properly which I'm sure they are aware of but pretend like they don't know. He finally gave me the tickets afterwards. I will not be purchasing a red card ever again... Complete waist of money and a complete rip off. BEWARE!!"}
{"text":"The kids wanted to meet up and hang out with some of their friends so this is place they chose. The games could use some updating, but the air hockey table was where they spent most of there time! This was not your average air hockey table. This was air hockey on steroids. At different times like 20 small pucks would slide down on the table and it was a blast seeing the kids faces light up with excitement!  We got here a bit late so we didn't get to try the food, but looking at the pics on Yelp, I may just go back for lunch before we leave Vegas. The bar looked pretty cool as well had 2 pool tables in back, but I was with my kids and holding my littlest man man so no adult activities for daddy. Another cool thing about this place is they had a section with some of the classics, Pac Man, Donkey Kong, just to name a few. All and all the kids had a blast even little guy fun on some riding games.  Ambiance 3/5 Food 0/5 but looking forward to trying  Drink 0/5  Service 0/5 Overall Experience 3/5 Till next time Drink, Eat, and Enjoy this life you live - Groux"}
{"text":"E-sports section of Gameworks  is the real gem. I bring my son all the time and every  employee that works there is awesome! They have a great selection of games and stay up to date. Also, if you ever get hungry or thirsty you can order from the menu while you play. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"Drinks were really good, had a great time playing the games as well! One issue. Nigga, how the fuck are you gonna let a bowling machine \"snap in half\"? And not tell anyone about it. We sat there for a good hour waiting for an employee to go into the bowling section, but as soon as they see the bowling machine is fucked they 180 outta here. They didn't let us know until we asked what happened. We would have asked sooner, but, again, it seems like the bowling employees are allergic to work."}
{"text":"This place seems good if you want to take your kids out for some entertainment without so much of the adult crowd. If you are single or going out for an adult night, I'd recommend that you go to Dave & Busters instead. While the food here is good, the service wasn't great and there were a lot of teens and kids running around. There aren't a lot of games and if you get the unlimited play pass it's restricted to games that don't have tickets (they won't tell you that when they sell it to you) which is less than half the games. Expect to be ready to move on within a couple hours."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and had a blast! Yes, I'm 22 years old, but hey acting like a kid is fun. LOTS of games, surely you'll find at least a few you'll enjoy. I went here on a date and it was a great choice. Spend $20, get a 100 credits. Games average 2-4 credits, some of the really great ones are 8-12 credits. Have shooting games, fighting games, racing games, music games, dancing games, and lots of other games. Love love loved it. Spent 2 hours there and didn't even notice. Laughed, yelled, cussed, and smiled. You get really into some of the games :-) Anyway, overall great."}
{"text":"When your starting out on day of of Vegas, before you hit up the pool parties, after a long drive, and you want to chill with some games  and beer...GAMEWORKS!!!! I love this place. The usual party crew hit this place up courtesy of a 50% groupon we received few months back,   Originally we wanted to hit up Rambo, but, one of the controllers were broke, but hold on....We had to roll to the bar and grab a beer..Blue moon of course :). Ok, back to Rambo...Well, we didn't get a chance to play, so we did the next best thing, House of the Dead baby!   It was a competition between My wife and myself one team, and the other team Brian B and Rob P. We both had the trick of swiping to get additional credit, but they did it more than us, because in the end....What happened is we reached the second to the last villain, and we ran out! Which meant, we have to take some petron shots from the bar, yes, that was the bet. Of course, fellow yelpers Rob P and Brian B took care of business and finished the game with one credit left! Damn them lol.  From that point the wife and I hit up the hummer race game, and after that grabed some grub and more beer.  After a great meal and some games (Sliders and beer), we hit up Pac Man! Now this was nice, Four controllers, four yelpers, we competed baby! Best out of five, and loser takes shots...Of course, we lost track and all of us took shots.  Awesome time yelp peeps!  Oh ya...On the way there, before we hit up gameworks, we saw Elvis leaving the building and game him a ride to his car!  Yes, only in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty and kind of gross. 1 out of every 3 machines/games I tried to play were broken, and I don't think you get good value in the swipe card.   The temperature in here was too high, and there was a sweaty feel to the air. Everything was sticky! I was hard pressed to find a safe spot to set down my purse, haha jk, I mean my jacket.   My girl and I made the best of our adventure here, but overall left disappointed, because this place has potential, and if they don't step up, clean up and get their machines working, I don't think this place will last."}
{"text":"GameWorks should aptly be renamed to NothingWorks or possibly BrokeWorks.  These names would be more fitting.  So thru my work I got an opportunity to purchase almost $200 in game certificates like 1 hour free plays and 20% off your bill for like $24, so I hadn't been here in almost 15 years, I went a few times when I first moved to Arizona back in 2000 and lived in Tempe, then eventually when I realized that Arizona Mills is like the slums, I stopped going, back then Game Works was actually a cool spot to hang and play the latest games...not so much anymore.   No joke I want to say that 1 out of every 3 games there is either broke or does not work correctly, the staff is a laughable bunch of kids that are not much older then most of the brats that are running around this place, and you would be lucky to find one staff member if you were on fire and you need to know were a fire extinguisher was. All the trash was over flowing out of the garbage's. And the place is disgusting, nothing is cleaned they should pass out sanitizer with the game cards. I found half eaten food inside some of the games. It smelled bad, and everything is sticky.   I can imagine if you have kids and bring them here they would all get sick...it's because this place is the dirtiest shit hole I have ever been in. I have seen nightclubs after they turned the lights up on a Friday night that are cleaner then this place...puke included. And don't get me started on the Men's room. The smell alone is enough to gag a maggot. I will be throwing out the rest of my coupons, or giving them away to people I dislike.   This place should be called Joke Works. The jokes on you if you go here. AVOID."}

{"text":"9pm.Tues nite.. Hint!  hardly any of the games work....machines are always broken, old old junk and a waste of time. Close down or upgrade  pls.....Go to back,to eat. wait 4 mins., no employees, sit down for another 5 mins. no employees....they have deserted the restaurant.   I give up.   save me pls. from Gameworks.   restuarant could care less if you are there or not. Stop hiring kids...They don't care."}
{"text":"A fun place to be a kid again. Good way to spend a afternoon. I've been here a few times with a groupon and without one. If they have the $20 all day passes on groupon it's going to be your best value. Includes $10 worth of ticket or lounge play too. Has an assortment of arcade games and ticket machines. With bowling alley, bar and dining area in back. The venue is big lots of room to move around. Customer service is friendly and good overall. Usually highschool kids or young gamers work the floor. The food was your typical bar food. Nothing special. Service in the dining area was very good."}
{"text":"Went there last night to have a few drinks before a movie. Bartender was very unfriendly. (Girl with blue streaks in her hair) Didn't make us feel welcome, she seemed put out if we asked her anything, and just gave bad vibes all around. She was also slamming cabinets and drawers, seems as if she dragged her body along. Someone working in the hospitality industry shouldn't be so miserable. Makes you wonder about management as well. There's tons of bars in this city! Will not be back"}
{"text":"My family and I have been here plenty of times. The staff is always so friendly and accommodating. The bathrooms are always maintained. (Huge plus for me!)   They always have a deal on groupon that you may use anytime during the week. I highly suggest it!"}
{"text":"I'm an arcade connoisseur, but unfortunately I don't often get to go to a good arcade.  Most of the arcades I see are filled with redemption games, skeeball, and a couple of beat up Cruisn' cabinets.  So I was really excited to find Gameworks.  This arcade is HUGE, and has an awesome selection of games.  One of the things I liked was the layout.  The games were grouped by type: shooters, fighters, racers, simulators, and pinball.  Highlights include:  - separate room with every House of the Dead game, complete with blood-splattered walls and zombies   - brand new Pump It Up NX machine - section of old school cabinets (Moon Patrol, baby!) - Mario Kart Arcade - Air Trix (I miss this game) - MvC2 - Tekken 5 (with card dispenser, if you dig that sort of thing) - Star Wars arcade game - House of the Dead 4 Special (a sight to behold)  The only place where they lose points is the card system.  While I've started to warm up a bit to card systems because they simplify things, the prices here are pretty exorbitant.  $35 for a day pass?  Damn.  You best believe I played the crap out of everything for that price."}
{"text":"We had a great time here.  Between three of us, we shared two unlimited card and had a great time.  I forgot how much fun it is to shoot zombies.  Also, the drinks were REALLY reasonable for being on the strip."}
{"text":"Well like any other game works, you can expect to pay anywhere between $1 and $2.50 for a single credit of any game. It's very expensive but you can save a lot by purchasing time cards, this seems to be the way forward with any 'swipe card' location.  Machines at this location are generally quite new, however, games can be out of order for months! I have no idea what the techs get up to here, but it certainly isn't machine fixing! When I ask for help fixing a game, they just put my credit back on my card and avoid the problem. Emailing the manager gets results, but we shouldn't have to right?!  Food is pretty good actually, for bar food. Spending $15 can get you a 2 hour game card, so this is the way to go. They also have bowling and a gaming lounge, not my scene personally, but it's there!  I give this location a 2 out of 5 due to the price and poor machine fixing. I will alter my review of this gets sorted out in the future"}
{"text":"This is the worst arcade I've probably ever been to, and I've been going for decades. After eight broken or otherwise unplayable machines, I asked for a refund; I was refused. I got two one-hour cards as compensation, which I wasn't happy with. Their staff was unapologetic and ignorant of their own facilities. A really disgraceful member of the franchise. Please avoid."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon if free unlimited  game play which sounded awesome. Unfortunately, most the games were out of service. And the interior definitely could use a makeover especially the bathrooms"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for awhile and probably won't be back for awhile due to so many games either not working, not functioning properly, or just plain taking your money. This place needs some serious maintenance & upkeep. Worth traveling to Dave & Busters for a better gaming experience."}
{"text":"CONNNER IS THE BEST PERSON FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!  We had an issue with groupon but he helped us out in a timely manner & they were about to close but he helped us out.  I'd give him employee of the month if I could      THANKS CONNERR!!!!!! I had the best time at Gameworks with all my friends!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool but there are quite a bit of shortcomings. Expect a cross between Chuck e Cheese & Dave and Buster's. A group of my friends came here after buying the Groupon deal for all day arcade play.   The bar was such a nightmare. I was trying to buy a couple rounds of drinks for my group of friends (6 people) before heading over to the games, but we ended up only doing 1 round (took at least 20 to 30 minutes from ordering drinks to actually getting the bill paid for). There were so many people trying to flag down the bartenders for food/drinks but there was not enough of them to provider service. I could have easily spent $100 more had there been a bartender, but we just got frustrated and left.   They had a good variety of games (ticket and non ticket), but the majority of them were broken. More often than not, one of the two controller would not work.  This place could be so much better if the management would maintain the games better and hire more bartenders."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a deal at this place, there is a catch.  They don't tell you on the sight or at the facility until you ask. I am not for spending a lot of money and my kids don't get to play all the games or even win tickets.  This place is a complete rip off."}
{"text":"I was thinking this place would be better than circus circus. It was but the problem is the particular game I like to play was intial D and Maximum Tuning. Both of these games are outdated in gameworks, there are newer versions of the the games like the initial D AA and Maximum Tuning 4 A+ or w/e it was I cannot remember. While I was playing the Maximum Tuning 3 in gameworks the four arcade systems were not linked up together even though it would be enjoyable to race against my cousin and other people. The card reader of the games does not work and they, gameworks, does not fill them with cards so kids or anyone could save their progress in the game.  The only good thing was the initial D 4. Everything about the game worked for example playing against other people, cards, and machines mechanics.  Other games- These games are working but may have some problems. Throughout the place I say about 80% of the games are working.  Bad games-  These games are either off or broken. They have a couple of these machines located in the fighting games area.  I came back to see if anything change, there were just a little changes. The midnight maximum tuning 3 did finally work of reading cards, vs, and ghost battle if you have a card already. The only thing about it is the machines still do not carry the cards to save data on it and play it later, because I luckily had a card that was that version and I began to play the game but sadly I ran out of certain number of plays a card can handle. I needed the machine to at least have 1 brand new card so I can update the card and play where I left off.  ------ Little info. on what I mean about the cards. The cards are considered memory cards for the game. Each card has a sixty game life, meaning if you lose a race, win a race, time race, ghost battle, and etc. it counts down until zero, when it reaches zero the player puts the card back in and the machine will offer to get a new card. If the machine had these special cards I would of got a new card and played longer, but I left disappointed and found something better to do.   NOTE: The three stars are for the games I described."}
{"text":"As far as Arcades go, Gameworks PWNS all, at least in AZ. The only reason that it doesn't get 5 stars is becuase it is a bit pricey. If you can find deals for like an hour or two of unlimited play, it is really worth it. They always have updated games. The House of the Dead series is always fun to play. They have such a variety. If you like Pinball, they have tons of pinball. If you like 1st person shooter games, they have tons. If you like ticket producing games, they have tons of them, if you like air hockey, they have the coolest air hockey tables. They just have so much to do. Its worth a good night of game playing fun."}
{"text":"The Gameworks at townsquare was such a disappointment. They barely had any good games and is smaller than the original gameworks. They could have fit in more games if they left out the bowling and restaurant area that nobody was using. Oh well...the best game in my opinion was the Family Guy pinball game."}
{"text":"I like this place i have one problem tho i couldn't get serves at the gaming  area and kids run around every where here but otherwise its nice"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this arcade. Firstly, ALL of the employees are EXTREMELY RUDE! From the door to the exit they make you feel like the hate their job and they don't want you there. They were all young and had a bad attitude. My friend and I encountered 5-6 different employees with the same bad attitude.   We went On a Friday night. A large percentage of their games were broken so my friend and I could hardly play anything together. They had a cool picture booth but that was about it.   Even on the game we managed to play together 15 minutes before it closed we had 2 different employees tell us it was closing with an attitude.  I never want to go back but I have money left on my card. Hopefully they'll fix some machines and bad attitudes if I ever decide to."}
{"text":"Had a great time at Gameworks at Town Square last night. Jarred was our server while we were bowling. Jarred was very knowledgeable about the food menu and was spot on about the Short Ribs entree (2 big pieces of beef short ribs over a bed of creamy mashed potatoes and gravy). Wish they had more games tho. I spent about 2 hours on the new Transformers game and the jet fighter game."}
{"text":"The best part about this GameWorks is the location it's in. Once you walk in and see that there's nothing to do you can just walk outside and go to the mall. This place is in desperate need of maintenance and upgrades.  Many of the game machines are broken so if you see something you want to play you're most likely going to have to wait and try to beat the next person to it. You could probably end up having a little bit of fun here but after about 20 minutes or so you'll be ready to leave."}
{"text":"It's okay. The only reason we keep coming back is because of the Groupon deal they offer. It's great if you're bored and want to kill time. The Ticket games are way too expensive though. Even the Groupon deal doesn't get you very far with them. Now for the games you can use the all-day pass on, it's cool. They have a variety, but you can get bored quite quickly. There's always 2-3 broken though. But, my son likes the motorcyle thing, so that's what we use it over and over on. Even with the all day pass, we don't spend more than 2 hours here, ever. Like I said BUT, my son likes to go here, even if he gets bored quickly. But then again, he's 5 years old so, even an empty brown box can entertain him."}
{"text":"Well this place was a disappointment. Bought the groupon deal. Was incredibly confusing with two cards and figuring out which machines to use which cards. Sometimes the cards worked and then they wouldn't. You don't win tickets with the Groupon card deal and there is a ton of machines just to roll or spin for more tickets which is pointless on the deal. Place is not clean and everything feels extremely run down! So many out of order machines and some that didn't even have out of order placards but didn't work! Would not come here again unless they did some serious updating."}
{"text":"Me and a buddy came here cuz we had the same day off to just relax and have some fun. We decided to bowl a couple games. We asked for a waitress to take our food and drinks orders. It took them 15 minutes to send someone. She took out order and it took another 10 minutes to get a soda? Keep in my mind the establishment is empty! We didn't get our food till we were done bowling. I had to have someone go find the waitress. This place is a waste of my money! If I could give it zero starts I would've!"}
{"text":"Gameworks. When you hear that it should sound like a dream to everyone. The former Gamewirks that was on the Strip was a wonderful attraction. It had hundreds of games in a large space as well as a rock climbing wall that was transformed into an area for more games. When the original closed in Spring 2012, it was pretty heartbreaking. There were no real arcade places around Las Vegas that was on the level of Gameworks. This new TownSquare Gameworks is a degrader. It's far more smaller which was a huge disappointment. There were a few games that were attractive such as the 3-D zombie game, basketball, football, a fighter jet simulator, a computer gaming area, and the bowling alley. Everything else was more for the younger children running around. There is also a bar for the adults to relax which is nice for them. There is a new \"Recharge Center\" to reload credit into your card which is needed for the games, which is great. Other than that I wish this place was larger and beeds more games."}
{"text":"Skip that place-that-shall-not-be-named and try your kid's party here. Hosted my son's 6th bday in the cosmic bowling area for 25 - kids & adults. The kids bowled first, since we had to get them shoe'd up, bumpers & smaller-sized bowling balls; we ordered drinks & started snacking, leaving time for the kids to eat after they bowled w/ the adults settled in. The timeline worked out perfect for us.   For food, we went with:  - Fresh Fruit Tray -very fresh pineapples, melon, grapes, strawberries & blackberries; this is a huge colorful tray & loved it  -Caesar Salad - Crisp with dressing on the side- loved the dressing, was surprisingly tasty as I didn't know what to expect  -Baked Ziti -  this was also really surprisingly pleasing & a crowd favorite  -Pizzas - I didn't try personally, but the first order was gobbled up so we ordered a second round that was also destroyed  Overall, our hosts were super accommodating, worked with us within our budget & even helped us extend our party so that we could open gifts with family after everyone bowled/played in the arcade. A+ service!  We added on the 2 hour game cards. If you rent the bowling area, I'd skip the games. First of all, it's a madhouse & hard to keep track of the little ones. We could have just bowled w/ everyone (disclaimer: because we had so many adults, it was fun for the kids to clear out for awhile so adults had some space to bowl). The timed game cards are confusing- they don't work on many games & no tickets. The solution would be to get the paid game cards that play for tickets. I heard the cocktails were light but wines & beers appeased - I would stick with the mid-level bar tickets over the premium & next time - also comes w/ a variety of soft drinks in the package, refills included.  As far as kids parties go in an arcade setting, I highly recommend. I loved how easy going, yet attentive the planners and staff were. A solid 4.5 kid's party."}
{"text":"*UPDATED*  GM reached out to me within 24 hours of my review. Addressed all issues and was rectifying issues with the games as I was speaking with him. To me that speaks volumes on business. Thank you Mike for standing behind your prodict and going above and beyond the call to make it right by the customer."}
{"text":"Fun place to go on Thursdays when you can get the unlimited game card from I believe 6-10. Plus it's 18+ after 6pm so it's a really fun place to go, grab some drinks at the upstairs bar and play video arcade games drunk. Amazing what that little bit of alcohol does to your innerchild. Overall a fun place to go if you're looking for something cheap and a good time. Not quite as good as Dave and Busters but fun anyway."}
{"text":"My review was removed by Yelp (presumably by mgmt complaint) because I didn't provide enough detail.  So I'm rewriting my review, per the \"yelp community\" request.  I've been here before and the service on the restaurant side is less than desirable.  My most recent visit started of course walking to the front to be seated even though the tables are empty.  I was seated at a booth and there were crumbs.  As though the table was wiped down but some debris was left behind.  Adjacent to my booth was another booth with dirty plates/drinks etc. (like everyone placed the dirty dishes at one table to gather together).  Waitress proceeded to \"handle\" the dirty dishes then bring me water.  Didn't see her wash her hands, but she may have.  Food comes (not too long of a wait) and it's missing some stuff.  No biggy, just said hey, missing this and this.  I would of told the guy who delivered the food but he said \"food\" left the tray on the table and quickly left.  Keep in mind I'm still missing stuff from my food, the waitress has been told, then she goes to other tables.  Kind of hard to eat my salad without dressing.  I wait and get it, no big deal.  Food was ok, depending on what you get.  Better off eating elsewhere then going here to play games (assuming you have kids like me)  Happy Yelp community?!?!?! Lol"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome. Somewhere all age groups can go and have fun. There's arcade games,  bowling, pool, large tv's for sports, a bar, food; with all of that you're going to be entertained at some point. It's just like Dave and Buster's if you know what that is, but maybe a little better. I would definitely come back, and also suggest that you try it, cool place to hang out and there's so many other things within walking distance of this place(food,  bars, clubs, shopping, movie theater)."}
{"text":"We showed up to kill time with the kid, spent $24 on a game card. Within 30 mins we had played some cool games and even hit two jackpots!!! Burned through all the points by 45 mins in and then went to get prizes. Pretty good compared to Dave n busters"}
{"text":"The service was pretty bad in the restuarant. My family and I sat for 20 mins before we even got drinks. I gave them 3 stars because once the all female waiter group did speak to us they were very friendly. Before that we were aost invisible."}
{"text":"Fun and enjoyable.  Bar, bowling, and games!  Had a blast price on drink is fair, but on games find it a little pricey but great place!  Sweet girl bartender at bowling aisle and the gentlemen at the bowling area!"}
{"text":"Who said GAMEWORKS at Town Square is only for birthdays!!!! Our family is COSMIC BOWLING, playing in the video arcade and having our family Christmas gift exchange.! The manager RON made our family feel warm & welcomed and made sure he introduced us to our server (Brittany-also super duper nice) for any drinks or food orders. Everything is cozy & close enough to keep an eye on the squirrels and still have fun. We are so happy we decided to celebrate the holiday here instead of the crazy casinos! MERRY Xmas!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool pace. Got the all-day pass and spent a lot of time here during our trip to Vegas. Wide selection of games and the bar in the back had good food and drinks. Long Islands and nachos for the win!"}
{"text":"Great place for kid's parties. I recently attended one, where the family rented out a large room that had plenty of space for guests and tables full of pizza, wings, Philly cheesesteak egg rolls, and bruchetta. The food wasn't anything special, but that's to be expected from a place that focuses on games and entertainment. The employees working the party were friendly and attentive, regularly making sure food and drinks were restocked. The kids at the party were given cards that entitled them to 2 hours of game play on almost all games. Even on a Friday night there were plenty of games available with little to no wait times."}
{"text":"Food: Never really tried any real food here, but I did try the Oasis smoothies. They were alright, but they are made from powder and ice. This place does offer a lot of fast finger food like fries, chicken strips, and burgers.   Service: The employees are really nice and try to make conversation with you. They make sure you understand how time cards work and their restrictions and everything.  Decoration: This place is located in the basement level in-between the Coca Cola factory and M&M World. The area is dimly lit! It is pretty big and the place is jam-packed with lots of arcade style games (mainly consisting of racing or shooting games). They also have old-school games like Gauntlet, Pac-Man, and Centipede. I love playing the DDR game there! Some of the machines change once in a while (i.e. they recently took out the air hockey tables and put in a Rambo shooting game). It is just surprising how they haven't updated the Mario Kart 1 system to the Mario Kart 2 (I have seen those in Circus Circus already).   Summary:  Food: B (Based on only the smoothies) Service: A- Decoration: B+  Closing Comments:  This is a great place to go to if you want to kill some time or if you are underaged and cannot gamble. They offer time options (1, 2, 3, and all-day). I always get the all-day pass for $35 because you can leave and come back if you get tired of playing games all day. The 3 hour option is already $30 so might as well fork over $5 more. Also, if you do not have a card, you will be charged a $2 fee so remember to always bring it with you to save money!. I recommend playing the racing games and DDR!"}
{"text":"Oh man, what a great place. That one handsome tall buff guy, i think his name's Jake, helped us out so much. AJ was a lot of help too. All very friendly. Such a great environment."}
{"text":"Great place to get you inner kid going and have a little fun plus they have a bar and dinning room seating which is nice. They just recently updated their games but there is still room for improvement in this area as well as a lot of games are out of order anytime I come. This is the reason they get 4 stars instead of 5.  On the flip side they offer deals almost every day of the week like 3 hours of unlimited game play for $20 or $10 Thursday which makes for a cheap night if you have kids and you want to get them out of the house or if you just want to go chill in a laid back atmosphere.  They have a bowling alley with great prices and well as a internet gaming lounge so there is literally something for everyone. The food is average so don't go in expecting a save and busters type of food but it is nice to be able to grab a bite and watch some games in between playing some games"}
{"text":"Pretty meh food and service.  My girlfriend and I went for food and had a Town Square gift card.  We asked three employees if it was accepted there because it's not accepted at some locations like Fry's or Whole Foods.  Every one of them said \"I'm not sure but we should take it\" rather than go find a manager and find out.  Anyway we sat down and the waitress (Erika I think) came over to get drink orders.  I ordered a water and she thought I ordered a latte.  My girlfriend ordered a diet coke and the waitress said \"Is diet coke OK?\"  :(  Drinks come in the smallest glasses I've ever seen at a restaurant.  My girlfriend orders the pepperoni pizza and I order the steak frites.  It takes a bit too long to arrive, but it finally does.  There is no salt, pepper, or ketchup on any table so we have to ask for all of that.  The steak frites is supposed to come with a tangy ketchup but it is not on the plate so I ask the server about it and she says \"Um, we have buffalo sauce but that's for the wings and I don't even think that's very hot personally ha ha ha.\"  I have no idea why she decided to respond to me that way, but whatever.  The fries are OK, the steak is actually pretty good, but my the pizza was very bland and tasteless.  It took way too long to get drink refills, and when we got them the waitress took our straws away and brought us new wrapped straws.  She also tried to pull a plate out from under me as I was still eating something on it.  Finally, at the end of the meal I have my payment card in my hand, all our plates are in front of us with the napkins and utensils on top and the waitress comes by and says \"Oh, do you want some more drinks?\"  No I want to pay and leave!    The food was overpriced ($17 for the steak frites and $4 for the diet coke!) and not that great, but the service was absolutely awful.  I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money on this place, it is a joke and the management should be embarrassed that they're allowing people in the door. NOTHING like any other Gameworks you've ever been to...  We should have known we were in for a disaster when the poorly designed dining room (dumpy leather couch  from someone's dorm room in the way too-big waiting area?) only had one table of people at 8:30pm on a Friday night. But we had been looking forward to checking the place out for so long we let them seat us anyhow and tried to make the best of it by straining our necks to watch the too-small, misplaced TV's and ordering some food off of the very few options on their 1-page, Kinko's printed menu with too-small font.   While waiting for our food, we watched the wait staff deliver a plate of nachos to an empty table by the front door/windows (where hundreds of people walked by, looked in at the boring scene, and kept on moving). The employees proceeded to grab a few nachos here and there every time they passed by, and a few even sat down to eat. I thought maybe they were off the clock until one of them left the nachos, went in the back, and came back out with our food delivery.   The food was just so-so and not at all worth the price. I asked the server for some salt for my french fries and she dropped off an actual cup with salt in it and then started to walk off (as if this was the norm). I asked if there were any salt shakers, she said no, and then walked back to her own table of food.    I wish I could rate the game area but it's completely blocked off from the bar and restaurant (WHY??) and the dining experience was such a disappointing and boring downer that we decided to leave and head across to Yard House and Blue Martini to finish our date night instead.     We will never be going back here and my prediction is that it will be closed within a year unless some SERIOUS changes are made."}
{"text":"I had a blast! We got the groupon deal for $20 which included unlimited interactive game play and a $10 play card. So much fun!   I hadn't been to a game works in years and I was pleasantly surprised with this location. Lots of fun games, clean, friendly service and open until midnight. Good times. Definitely will be back again."}
{"text":"*******UPDATE***** I am updating my review based on the General Manager reaching out to me. I must say any company that takes reviews seriously & contacts the customer directly to rectify the situation deserves 5 stars!!! I was so impressed with the professionalism, generosity & kindness. I also want to point out, no one will experience what I did b/c they took down all of my complaints and listened intently to be sure and solve the issues for future customers. I'm positive you will enjoy yourself! Thank you Keith for taking the time to reach out to me! I look forward to my next visit : )"}
{"text":"I have not been here in ages.  The games are way cooler and fun but the crowd is little teens.  I remembered this place for adults?  The kids are everywhere.  Running, rude, jumps in line in front of you, and just runs into people.  WTF!  Get some manners you little sh?ts!!!  Then to top it off, it was freaking HOT in there.  I was melting."}
{"text":"Great place for the whole family ...this is an awesome place to go with the whole family . We spent the whole day there . Bowling. Video games food drinks"}
{"text":"Rip off!!! I was looking forward to this place for a year, total disappointment. Any arcade on the strip is just as good if not better. Over priced games! Very small areas, everyone was cramped tight and I almost lost my composure in there due to the fact that the arcade area is so small and when playing skee ball was afraid to play with confidence due to trying to a avoid bumping in to someone while playing. Lines for a lot of games and not many choices to pick and play from made it not fun. Will not be coming back spent 27$ for 20 min of very annoying and frustrating entertainment. And some of their games are not working."}
{"text":"Channon really gave me great service n drinks 2day. Thank you. I just wanted one drink, but her charm and enthusiasm left me with a handful of drinks.."}
{"text":"We stumble into Gameworks cause it is in the middle of Coke & M&M... I have mix feelings about the facility. We purchase the all day pass for my kids. The arcade is average some of the machines doesn't work which is a bummer... we played a bunch of racing games & quick & crash. But what really bothers me is one of the employee in the counter he seems really racist. He would only cater to guest that are white even when we have been waiting for so long & been the only one in the counter... He would just pass us.   What goes around comes around & KARMA is a B!#"}
{"text":"Went visiting some relatives out here in sin city and we decided to take our little cousins somewhere fun!    This place is a treat! They had a great deal going where it was unlimited games for $12.99 (not including the ones that gives tickets) and that was perfect for us. Ended up getting one for each kids and set them loose. Plenty of games to play and they had this esports center that had  game consoles and tons of gaming pcs to play.    I also would love to point out the surrounding area had plenty of food options and shops also a movie theatre! Great place to go if you want to escape the craziness of the strip!"}
{"text":"What the heck...when did gameworks close lol? It was the place to be when I was under 21 though.  Since I turned 21 I never really gave the place a second look haha. Why waste money in video games when I could put that money on the roulette table and just put the money on 19-36...bam doubled my money 8) . Seriously think they should have left it open for the kids and stuff out there. Vegas is slowly losing all of it's family friendly places so this place closing is just speeding up that process. I feel sorry for all the teenage boys who now have literally nothing to do on the strip anymore. Just hold out until you are 21 boys. It's worth the wait...trust me!  I wonder if they ever got rid of that sewage smell haha"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to give our kids one last day of fun before school started back up again so we decided to treat them to a day of fun at Gameworks.     As we walked in we were greeted by an adorable young lady who explained the different options for purchasing game cards for the children to use to play the games.  I'm not sure which \"package\" my husband purchased but it was the perfect amount for keeping the kids happy and busy for a few hours!  I don't remember the last time my kids had this much fun.  After an hour and a half or so we decided to sit down and grab a bite to eat.  The kids each got a cheeseburger and fries and my husband and I shared a couple of flatbread pizzas.  We were VERY impressed with the quality of the food we received.  Our server, I can't remember her name, was an absolute doll.  The food came out quickly and hot.  We will definitely be back to try more of the menu items in the future.  A manager even stopped by to make sure we were enjoying our visit.  All in all, it was a fantastic experience for my husband and I as well as our kids who have been begging to go back since we left.  Thanks Gameworks!"}
{"text":"First off- weird configuration with choppy separation of games and dining.  I like Dave & Busters where it's all more incorporated so parents can sit and still be in same room with kids while they play and we can enjoy food and cocktails.  So instead, I followed the kids around, lugging all the winter coats and hats.  After blowing $80 myself and another $100 with friends, we finally went to eat and ordered a bunch of pizzas.  They tasted more like frozen tombstone pizzas but bigger than I though based on yelp reviews.  The problem was service.  Other than taking the initial order and dropping food, we NEVER saw our waitress.  I had to literally walk around the dining room on three occasions flagging down OTHER waitresses for extra plates, drink refills, etc.  the dining area was NOT full.  Each server had maybe a maximum of 3 tables to serve.    3 hours after being served and then after 20 minutes trying to hunt down our bill, I finally was fed up.  I saw three managers in a corner and approached them and told them what happened and asked for the bill.  Meanwhile, others in my party asked another waitress for my bill, who then found our waitress, who dropped it off.  We sat there, with credit card in the bill sleeve and again, waited and no one came to pick it up.  So I walked the bill and credit card to the manager myself.  The manager (Heather maybe) was on it.  She apologized profusely and said she understaffed the dining room.  I've waitressed before and if a server can't handle 3 tables, they need better servers. Without us asking, the manager comped the ENTIRE meal and gave us free 1 hour play cards.    While the experience was frustrating- I would go back simply because management responded so well.  I felt bad too, thinking of leaving a tip for the server- not huge but something.  But I saw her talking to the manager and looking at our table and throwing her arms in the air in disgust and then storming off.  That just really turned me off.  She never apologized for any delay.  Not sure if right or not, and might get a lot of flak but I really don't reward bad servers.  We were a table full of hungry people and we sat with empty plates, etc. for. a long time.  That server really missed the opportunity to sell us a salad, some wings and dessert.  But she never checked in on us.  We will return and try the restaurant again simply to support the business and hope they fix their kinks.  And if we get decent service, we will tip appropriately.  But I hope they work this out- it could've been a great locals addition to Town Square."}
{"text":"We stepped into game works looking for something fun to do.  We arrived with a couple friends we hadn't seen in a while and sat at the bar with Kareem.  He is an excellent bartender and has an awesome personality.  He gave us some tips on how to get the most out of our dollar for game play. We got an hour of play each and had an awesome night.  Now we actually come in just to see Kareem."}
{"text":"3D games no 3D glasses, about %25 of games or more are out of order, save your money. I always leave nice reviews when deserved. The bar looked good for adults and their new XD Dark Ride was the only fun game all other games are very outdated. We will not be returning very boring they need to put more experience games not worth the money hope management reads this and they make it fun for people one day."}
{"text":"Came here for the kiddies. Got a groupon deal which was awesome $20 for all day pass and $20 freeplay. Kids had an awesome time. Nice location with many shops in the town square that parents can enjoy while the kids game their brains out. They have a nice little restaurant in the back with a BAR (yeah baby). Win win for all. If I would have paid full price the review would be different definitely. Awesome deals to.o for weekdays. See photo."}
{"text":"Ok after awhile we came over they changed couple of games winning prices  Before my kids use to win many prices they were happy  No No No more So the good place now is glow zone  Fun and no need to spend money to much"}
{"text":"Points on your game card never expire and you get more for your money the more you buy at one time. Buy one card and share it for the best value. If you buy to many, save the card and use it again when you come back. Great selection of games from classics and pinball to shooters and fighters. Great for kids and adults!"}
{"text":"Friday night was the fourth or fifth time I have stopped by Gameworks. It's on my way home from work so I meet up with friends there occasionally. I always have a great time.  Whether it's playing the games with my friends,  bowling, or hanging out at the bar, it's fun.  The staff has always been friendly and helpful.  The food is yummy,  especially the chicken nachos,  and the bartenders are a lot of fun, especially the chick with the skull tattoo. Check it out. Make sure you play the Pacman air hockey game,  it's crazy."}
{"text":"The place is clean and the staff is very friendly.  Of course we are here when there is nobody in the middle of the day on a weekday.  A lot of the games don't work correctly and rather than trying to find someone you are better off living with the loss.  That was disappointing."}
{"text":"My major issue with this place is the majority of games are ticket only games. The esports Center was closed and the few arcade games that were not broken had lines with people who just were not getting off the machines. Thankfully I only paid 24 bucks for both my sons but even that seems steep with what was offered. Lame experience overall and wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Yelp, you really need to stop removing my reviews just because I don't agree with everyone else. I don't feel like typing it all out again, but basically I'm giving the place five stars because I think it's a great addition to TS, and you can make a fun night of it between AMC, this, and Blue Martini. You could spend hours at TS because of those three places. Yes, some games were broken, but I'll give them a few months to work out the glitches. I also see the arcade expanding in the future because the restaurant doesn't seem to be that popular, but the rest of the arcade is. Peace."}
{"text":"This was the spot to go before you turn 21.  I haven't been here in years but I remember it was always fun when I was like 13.  Back in the day they had an unlimited play card for like 21 bucks or something.  They had cool games and a giant rock climbing apparatus in the middle.  I remember it to be 75 feet high and super tiring to get to the top.  I only made it 2/3 of the way and it was still hard!  Once you get 2/3 of the way up the wall levels off so it's practically vertical.  Good luck climbing it!"}
{"text":"I was trying to have a good day with son, but a lot of games kept malfunctioning . Here's why Star is low , because when I got a credit back from manager from a broken game , he made no effort to place a sign on game so the next person wouldn't get ripped off. If I was close to game, I would tell a gamer not to play, but throughout time I was there , I saw several kids getting ripped off, but they would just walk away, I guess the manager knew that someone like me, asking for credit back was rare , so he was making money by just leaving game unfixed. Place stinks with odor, workers seem to not care, and manager acts like he's to good for his job. This place is just 'Hype'."}
{"text":"Sadly it is smaller than I would have expected. They could use more rides. I miss the one they had on the strip. That one was DOPE. Anyways, it is a cool place for little kids, but the whole family would have a better time at Circus Circus :)"}
{"text":"GameWork's team is incredible! We had our son's birthday party there today. For a couple weeks prior to I had spoken to/emailed with Samantha. She was always quick to respond & answer my MANY questions on our options.  Upon arrival, she came out greeted us, got our party set up immediately in the restaurant as well as promptly set up the kids with their game cards.  We were then greeted by Jamie (server) who took our pizza/drink order.  There was a mistake on our order & timing of our food but the WHOLE  team made every effort to make it right. From Samantha to Charles to Ron to Chef Tommy, they all came out to not only introduce themselves but to correct the situation but make sure we knew they cared & would make our Gameworks experience a great one! And they certainly did! All the kids had a fantastic time playing & it was a great party for my 11 year old.  I would absolutely recommend a party at this GameWorks!  Thank you again to the staff for your amazing service!!"}
{"text":"If you're not into the whole bar scene or looking for a way to kill time in Town Square then check this place out.   This new location is much smaller than the previous one located on the strip, however, you can still find something that everyone will like. The main gaming area has games that I haven't seen in any other Las Vegas arcades including ticket, shooter, driving, 4D, old school and Japanese games. They even have Purikura inside! There is a section for PC and console games as well as a section for bowling. The bar area is a good size with plenty of seating inside and outside of the store. The seats also aren't located next to the games so it's nice not having people constantly walk around you while you eat (unlike Dave and Buster's).  The only downside is that these games are expensive because you pay with \"points.\" I suggest buying the package deal where you have unlimited play for 1 hour. We were offered this deal when a friend bought a drink at the bar so I'm not sure if a drink purchase is required."}
{"text":"The closest we will get to a Dave and Busters in Vegas.  The food here is pretty good and the option for the game card with your meal is available."}
{"text":"Everything LOOKED fun..Its all broken. Anything worth a damn is out of order. Waste of time."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. We got chicken fingers which came with fries. The pizza was thin and simple. The kids really enjoyed it. We did the Dine and play which really saves you money. I wish they would have just the hour game play but you have to buy the food."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for there restaurant I got a undercooked pizza and the taste was awful. I'm not got food poisoning in puking every 15 min and with stomach pains. Please don't eat here.  Now as far as arcades I give it a 5 star but the food a 0 the bowling alley is awsome and the bar is cool .   Only thing again stay away from the food"}
{"text":"Went to go see the hateful 8 at AMC and it was sold out...so my GF and I decided to stop at GameWorks after some post Xmas shopping. As an esports fan, I had to see that area. It's pretty cool to see GW recognize how big the esports industry really is. Upon entering, I was impressed by the variety, design and vibe of the esports area. I was greeted by Carlos, the manager, who told me that Alex and V (can't remember her full name) would take good care of us. They had amazing service and as we were playing Halo 5 I noticed V handle a group of loitering obnoxious teens (I rarely use this word, I'm still a big kid) like a pro. They made sure we were taken good care of. Well done everyone, will be back for sure. Very happy with my time spent there tonight."}
{"text":"GAMES DON'T WORK should be the name of the place. They're almost all broken!! Food was alright which is why I have them a couple of stars."}
{"text":"I really wanted to be able to give this place a better review, but it was pretty disappointing. Many of the games were down but they didn't seem to be in a hurry to fix any of them. We ended up going a few times during the week and saw no progress towards fixing said machines. The arcade was also a bit too dark and very dingy for my liking. The guys I went with had a good time, but they're pretty easy to please and spent the majority of the time playing the 4 man Pac Man machine - which apart from DDR was just about the only working thing I was interested in.  My friends got the all day pass because we ended up getting a few $10 off coupons which made it worth it. The all day timed cards can't be used with ticket or prize bearing machines, which eliminated a whole section of the arcade right off the bat. It's not a huge place, either. The prizes you could win with tickets were great anyways, but as I said there wasn't much variety to start with and the pool just kept getting smaller. There is a restaurant there which served questionable looking food, and they had nothing like popcorn to munch on quickly. They only allowed drinks on the arcade floor anyways.  If you have a few kids it might be fun for them to check out the place for an hour, so I wouldn't plan on being there all afternoon. It wasn't bad for a quick detour or to take a break from walking, but it was definitely a let down."}
{"text":"Wow, love this place to play games but never will eat here again. Too bad cause the food wasn't bad except the flat bread pizza was burnt. The service was HORRIBLE! Couldn't find anyone to seat us and the place was mostly empty. Finally got a dirty table that wasn't cleaned. Finally got a server. Drinks and food took forever and then it took over a half hour to get the bill in a fairly empty place. In fact I'm still waiting for the bill so I can sign it from miss happy server. Crappy night!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. I don't know why, but almost all of the machines were out of service or broken. A lot of the steering wheels on the racing games were jacked up or broken. Isn't this Vegas? Shouldn't it be better than a Gameworks such as Seattle? I was very disappointed... I wasted $25 here when I could have spent it on something else. The only thing good was the House of the Dead game that had two screens, front and back. That was the only cool thing about this place."}
{"text":"Visited GameWorks again with my family in March 2018, and was very disappointed with the experience.  We visited on a weekend night and found the arcade to be very crowded.  Many of the games were out of order, for the ones that were working there was a line to play.  Restaurant and bar were good.  None of the family including the children wanted to visit this arcade again.  This was probably our last visit."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love GameWorks?   I sure do!!! I come here a lot. It's great for all ages. I enjoyed their food here. I was very pleased with the services.   I bought a POGO pass for my God son and we used it here a couple of times. He got 1 hour of unlimited games. While he was playing games I was able to watch the football game on all their great TV screens.   One of the reasons why I give them 5 stars is because of it's location. It located in Town Square and they a lot of things to do for all ages in the area. Above GameWorks is a movie theater.   I recommend this place on a football Sunday :) because they have all the games playing and its a great place for kids, and if you have  wife have her go shopping since they have a lot great shopping stores near by. FUN FOR EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"Came here after dinner at yard house and absolutely loved it! Some games were out of service but we had a lot of fun playing everything else!"}
{"text":"I am only reviewing the arcade as I haven't tried the restaurant or bowling. Alot of arcades seem to be taking that approach these days (i.e. Round 1, KDB, Latitude 39). I came here for a Smash 4 Tournament and tried the arcade out between my sets. The game selection is small like many reviewers already stated, but the games they do have work well. They even have a Pump It Up Infinity that works amazingly well. I would like to see more Japanese games out here like Beatmania and Pop n' Music since the Gemini arcade palace closed. Overall, Gameworks Las Vegas is a small, underrated arcade that deserves more positive attention than it is getting."}
{"text":"Alot of the games were out of order and did not work, very dirty and not taken care of. Waste of money"}
{"text":"I remember the very first time my step dad took me to a video arcade.  I must have been about six years or seven years old.  It was the early eighties, and I was all about Defender.  Sure, I loved Missile Command.  Ultimately, I remember thinking Pac-man was \"kind of dumb\" but I never was much for maze games.  I wanted to press buttons, fly spaceships and shoot things.  Oh sure, I had an affair or two, Tron, Donkey Kong, the games with lots of pretty colors and such.  Nothing quite matches the magic of those days for me.  Perhaps it's the misty rose colored filter of childhood nostolgia, but arcades seemed like something different then.  Something magical.  Pitch black havens for the disenfranchised where a quarter was enough to win you fame and glory, provided you had the skills to back it up.  Fast forward some 2 decades later.  Video games have jumped the shark in a lot of ways.  With dedicated consoles, online gaming, and PC gaming,  most people don't leave the house to get their digital freak on.  A person doesn't get good at \"video games' They learn the survival skills for FPS, or RTS, or MMORPGs, Sports simulations, Music simulations, fighting games.  And they do it at home, or at a LAN party.  So what's the appeal of a place like Gameworks?  Well you get to hang out with the highly annoying teenage crowd at \"The Mills\".  But for me it's all about the latest developments in Arcade stand alones.  They have some interesting \"immersion\" / VR type games, like Sky Pirates (steampunk hot air balloon aerial combat baby!), Afterburner Climax (with a servo equipped cockpit designed with some help from Boeing and Northrop Grumman, you will soon find your ego writing checks your body can't cash, and loving it!), Of course they have the old skool stuff upstairs. But hey, I got plenty of that action 20 years ago.  Or Let's Go Jungle, a dose of safari madness where you and a friend can hop into your utility vehicle and unload on mutant frogs, leeches and lots of other unpleasant things.  The 50\" screen, 5.1 surround sound and kick back motors on the guns  help with the fun factor.  So when you get tired of listening to your best friend's girlfriend murdering another REM song on rock band while you hammer out a beat on your flimsy toy drum controller, when you've played with your wii so much that you can't lift the controller anymore, come down to Gameworks and try out some of the new developments in stand alone games.  The arcade is still fun, I promise.  But leave that Dio t-shirt everyone thought was so cool in the bottom of your closet.  Nobody really thought it was cool, we were just being nice.  (See Also Golf Land and Dave and Buster's.)"}
{"text":"This used to be the place to hangout back in the day but it's gone way downhill. All of the games are overpriced and most of them are broken or shut down. It's sad because my friends and I used to spend a lot of time there years ago. RIP Gameworks."}
{"text":"Cool place for my 9 year old son. On the pricey side. He was excited, we loaded $20 on his card and he blew through that in less than 45 minutes! The bowling alley looked nice we didn't bowl this time, however we did check it out for a potential birthday party site.  Overall we enjoyed it, would love it if it were more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"My husband and I purchased a great deal from groupon for $20 dollars each for unlimited game playing, but it is only valid on games that to not distribute tickets to redeem prizes. Sometimes the card allows you to play, but won't give you tickets. They had almost every type of game to play such as video old school arcade games,pin ball, virtual racing, air hockey, bowling, live xbox, pool table, basket ball shooting, etc...they also have a restaurant and bar. It has plenty seating. This place is good for meeting friends and having drinks. It's crowded during the weekends,but best time to go if you're an adult is Sun-Thurs after kids curfew 10pm. This allows you to play almost all the games, when it's crowded it becomes stuffy and hot, so dress lightly. Food and drinks are inexpensive, no coins are needed, you just buy a preloaded card and play as much as what you purchased. I hadn't had that much fun in years, that it left my hand and arm sore lol! Hats off to them for bringing kids, adults, and families out, and having a fun place to interact."}
{"text":"Cool place to spend some time with the family..tried \"Guitar Hero\" for the first time (addicting)...nothing we played was out of order at that time...WILL COME AGAIN for sure..."}
{"text":"Kids enjoyed during visit to Las Vegas. This place is much better option than Circus Circus kids game area"}
{"text":"What a great way to beat the heat! Needing practice on my video gaming skills this is a fantastic place to gain that hard edge experience that one might need.   Nestled in the far back, at Town Square it is a hop skip and jump from the strip. But without all the foot traffic that crowds the strip. When you visit GameWorks it is located in an air conditioned large space where one does not have to worry about the sun until you leave!  The games that they offer here are great with a wonderful mix of Star Wars first player games, those famous cycle and driving games to sharpen going around that curve just right.   This establishment is not just for children. Parents with children of all ages can come and enjoy all GameWorks has to offer. I have come here alone and with my twins when we're having family day. There is wonderful games where the family can all play the same game together or even play billiards as a family.  It is standard practice to purchase the red game card here for the best deal, I believe. I always load up with $20-50 and that will usually last a couple of hours. They have an email special that when you sign up they will give the guest a $10 game play no strings attached! Plus being part of the GameWorks email club they send all sorts of deals to your email that are very sweet.   For those of us that are over 21 and need libations they have that covered too! They have a full service bar here! The bartender that took my order today was from Dublin and had an amazing accent. There are adults only pool here in the bar area.  This trip I did not eat off of the menu, but have in the past. The food here is pretty good. With a lot of the entree purchase there is an option to score a free game play card too! These are wonderful deals too!   Now come on and get out of the heat and get your game on Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been here a ton of times! It might have been 6 months or so when we are coming every other week. Bought a Groupon for the last time we came but, wasn't able to get through old credits we had so the Groupon had expired. I was just going to see if I could get face value or something even a $5 game card for the $20 I spent on it. BRANDON, the retail front clerk super patient with me because, reception is horrible over here the Groupon wouldn't work so it took 20 minutes to get it pulled up just to show I did have it. He went above and beyond to work with me even though I wasn't expecting it all. I heard while I was here some of the employees that have been working here a while have said a new large company bought them out and have made so many improvements. I would give 4* due to poor cell service which , is out their control but, Wifi routers were pulled as well and signal from the Wifi is terrible so employees have you get on the Wifi from the restaurant Nextdoor which seriously better. You may want to reconsider getting a good router and solid Wifi points through out building because, Gameworks doesn't work. A server named NIKITA was cleaning a table and my daughter ran and asked him he had any water I told no and he brought out 2 bottle waters even though I didn't want them I was going to pay and he said nope it's on us! I must say employees seemed pleased with changes and as a customer who used to come regular when we had less kids activities will make an effort to make it a regular again especially if you bring back the Groupon deal which has to be a F&B and Bowling money making machine!"}
{"text":"I chuckled when I saw that this place is categorized on Yelp under \"Gastropubs.\" That's pretty generous.  I went to GameWorks for a big group dinnertime outing. We didn't get any special rates, just their Dine & Play combo that's always available. For $14.99, you get one of their time cards loaded for one hour, and one of ten specially labeled items on the menu. It's also possible to do $21.99 for a two-hour card, but nobody chose that option.  Like some of the others, I went with the Fish & Chips because it's normally $14.50, which is almost the price of the Dine & Play one-hour deal. I wasn't expecting much, but the cod fillets were reasonably flavorful. It's unfortunate that they seemed a little heavy rather than fluffy, and the batter wasn't as crispy as I'd hoped. I chose waffle fries for the side rather than mashed potatoes or salad, neither of which can really be called chips. The fries were decently seasoned and generally had a decent crisp and some fluffiness, but I've had better.  I also sampled the GameWorks Nachos (normally $12) with steak (+$3). I suppose that the meat could be construed as \"ground steak\" instead of ground beef. Nothing in the dish was anything special. I even prefer the TGI Friday's nachos over this.  I should note that they handled service for our rather massive table (20+ people) just fine, with constant replacement of water pitchers too, although condiments (notably ketchup for my fries) were a bit delayed.  As for the arcade, I only partook in one round of DDR Supernova 2 because I'd handed off my card to a friend while playing pool ($13/hr Sun-Thu 4pm-close, but I think they weren't too strict on the one hour). The pool tables and cues seemed decent enough, although someone noted that one of the rails seemed to be a bit dead. Anyway, from what I saw my friends play, the arcade had a nice selection of shooting games, air hockey, a crazy souped up Pac-Man inspired version of air hockey, some rhythm games, and some racing games. I've seen worse arcades for sure.  I should note that all the TVs were set to the Monday Night football game, with audio available seemingly everywhere in the building. This was fun for casual fans and for vocal Cowboys fans alike. They also have a football game-day food promo that I believe was $35 for a large (16\") one-topping pizza, 35 wings, a pitcher of soda (or +$5 for a pitcher of beer), and one-hour game cards at $5 per person. I also noticed that they offer $10 unlimited gaming on Thursdays 5pm-close and immediately wished that the social had taken place then. Oh well.  I don't foresee myself coming back very soon, but GameWorks has some potential appeal for arcade gaming. Just don't expect too much from the food and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Okay, so it may not be that big and it's not what most of us had expected but they had to use the space they were given. I have heard they are expanding and since I've been back, they had added several more games along with fixing the broken games. Although they may not have had what I expected, I'm still happy with going to Gameworks and playing their games.  The service is pretty good except I did find it annoying when the barista in the bowling area would rather be texting on her phone or flirting with the one guy behind the bar than serving other customers. I had to ask the bowling attendants to get my drink. I understand it's slow, but it would be nice if someone looked up occasionally. But the rest of the staff are very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed . The restaurant looks like it just a temporary spot. They failed to do much with spot other than paint walls place chairs and tables.. A few TVA and  games..  Not much more to see.  The food was terrible and considering there was only one other family there you would think they could do a better job. My caesars salad was soaked with dressing and soggy. The chicken was okay. My husbands fish and chips were dripping with old oil.. But the kids seemed to like the chicken strips and French fries. I think the only thing that was okay to me was the calamari and aioli dip.  The rides/ games were extremely over priced. However  at least the service was excellent. Laura our waitress was great and made sure we never had to ask for a refill. She was the one bright spot.  We don't have plans to go back.. Rather wait til we travel to a place that has a Dave and busters."}
{"text":"our family  got the groupon with $20 in play and an all day unlimited pass. We had a friend who has a POGO pass to use also. We thought this was going to fun way to waste a day were we all disappointed! We normally go to Dave and Buster's and have a blast! 50%  Gameworks games are  broken or aren't working properly in all the times going to Dave and Buster's we only seen one game down and it was repaired within a couple of days. After an hour and half we had played what games we could and were bored.  We didnt even bother  with food because if they cant keep the video games in good shape , i cant imagine what the kitchen looks like!! The only staff member who was nice to us was Troy on Darkride XD."}
{"text":"Yeah...  So Like everyone else, I am very disappointed with this location. I was so excited for it also! I thought that it would be a great addition to the Town Square and was really hoping it could live up to the previous version of Gameworks that was on the Strip.. at least a little. In my opinion however, it does not. Not even close. Which, is understandable actually. The Las Vegas Strip Location was fantastic in many ways. If  the Town Square location could even be 1/4 of what the previous version was, it could be great.   I agree that first and foremost, this place should be about the games. I also believe that they have really failed at the design of the space as far as the games go. There appear to be a lot of cool games though they are crammed into a corner. The layout is not cool. So clustered and uncomfortable to walk through when there are many players around.   Staff was all awesome and very accommodating, I will say  that now.  I walked around a bit and saw the space in the back, that appears to be for private events maybe? A few empty rooms with LCD TV's mounted on the walls. I don't know, but I'd rather see that filled with games and maybe some themed rooms. That's another thing.. the space is so stark and boring and as I mentioned previously, the layout is kinda whack.   The bar specifically, and even a restaurant that serves alcohol should not be something that kids walk through. It's not a difficult fix. There should be a divider wall between those areas. there are a couple of spaces that can be divided off for over and under 21 patrons. I understand that Gameworks will draw many under 21 people, but  as this is Las  Vegas and there is a huge market for the adult kids! As it stands, it's very uncomfortable to sit at the bar. Your back is to the walkway with kids going by, just not cool in my opinion. It even looks uncomfortable for the bartenders and servers to be serving there.   I know that people reading this: employees, managers, owners and guests alike, will agree, disagree and be every range of emotion available at these reviews that are so negative. It's not easy opening a new place. Going in, everyone knew there were high expectations.   I can't even go into much else without writing a full website on the subject, but I feel like this Gameworks needs a serious overhaul already. I really look forward to some major changes and hope that they come sooner than later. I will occasionally drop in to help support that.. but I cannot see myself spending money on games until those credits drop or you some form of unlimited play is offered as it has been in the past.. say $20 10pm-until close for adults, and something for the kids on weekends?   I wish you luck Gameworks! You are responsible for a great many happy and fun memories in my earlier years! I want to be part of something great like that again!"}
{"text":"Fun times to be had here.... Alcohol on site & an assortment of not-so-typical games here as well. They have their classic games section... their 'physical' games section..(i.e. requiring you to punch the screen, kick the ball, swing the bat, etc..) and other unique titles... especially since 'the console' has replaced the 'arcade machine', this place tends to bring feeling of nostalgia to myself.  Pros: Drunken airhockey with four people when seven pucks drop into play.  Cons: Drunken horseracing when your stomach conflicts with your stamina. (Pumping those horse up&down sounds like fun until you get competitive.)"}
{"text":"Took my 6 year old here for some kid fun. It was was better than the gameworks that use to be on the strip near the mgm. This one is cleaner, it seems bigger or maybe its just their set up is better but its really nice. They have a video game room with up to date video gsme consoles and computers. Very cool cause its like a kids lounge area where they can chill and play video games on couches and or sit at a computer at a desk and chair and play games on there. Also they have a small bowling alley. It was small but for the price it was pretty neat. Only a few dollars per game and shoes. All the games were fun. My daughter really enjoyed the ski ball the most. Some of the games that were more credits than the others was a little bit of s rip off and the way they kept track of your tickets made me wonder because its all on a card and my daughter played for a good hour and only ened up with a small amount of tickets so made me wonder how they track how many ticketd you get per game. But the fact my daughter was having fun made me not even car. She got about 500 tickets for the entired 3 hrs we were there. She got to get 3 small toys at the prize area. The lady said she was 20 tickets over with the one prize she picked out but she just let my dsughter have the small little cup she wanted. So that was very nice customer service.  I mean you figured if im spending $30-$50 for my 6 yr old to play games there the fact they let her walk with one small free gift shouldnt be a big deal since i spent more money on the games than the toys. Lol. The toy is worth less. I guess you're just pretty much paying foe the experience not the toys. Thats a better way of saying it. I will for sure go bsck again sometime.  She liked it and I like that she liked it. I like that its right there in town square too. What a nice location. Convenient and also smart because they probably get a lot of teenagers and or kids cause its right near the movie theater and town square is pretty busy most of the time."}
{"text":"Got a groupon for an all day pass and a $10. play card. Many types of games and an all day card allowed us to play for a couple of hours go eat lunch and come back for another hour and half. Was so much better than losing at the slots. Came home with a Domo dressed as a bee."}
{"text":"Kids love this place but allot of the games are not working.  Upgraded games/maintenance is desperately needed. Not sure if the old games are them trying to be Retro or cheap.    Restaurant is empty because the food is just okay and service is less than desirable.   It's average but with potential."}
{"text":"Gave this place a 2. It does deserve to have a 2 because of where it's located, being the fact that Town Square is my second home. After hours of shopping with the kiddos, they deserve to have their fun.   Other than that.... This new game works is super boring, not enough games, my kids were bored 20 mins into playing.   FOOD is crap. They don't even have the option of getting a whole pizza like the old Game Works at MGM. Only a pan size personal pizza for $14. Nachos with \"string\" like shredded chicken which had no taste and hardly anything on them.   SERVICE. Well, wasn't too great. Had to call her to order and since it was our first time at this location, we had a lot of questions about the menu, and she was a little irritated with our questions. We then finally ordered. We got 2 pepperoni pizzas and chicken nachos.   She told us if we added $3 more dollars to each of our items, we would get a free play card. So it would've been perfect for not buying more play cards. So we did add the $3 special for the card play, but she didn't mention to us until after we won at least 10,000 points on games that it wouldn't be included on their dinner play cards.   Not only did the server and this place ruin our dinner, but made my kiddos cry for not getting any prizes they've earned on those games.   NEVER AGAIN WILL I BE BACK."}
{"text":"It's basically a smaller version of Dave & Busters. It comes with a bar and a small dining area.   Food: The food there is okay. Pricing is alright for the portions you get. I wouldn't eat here again. I would just grab food somewhere in the plaza.   Location: Great area, located right next to the movie theater. You get the best of both worlds. Teenagers, kids and adults can all enjoy a movie then come here afterwards.   Games: Variety of games to play. From winning tickets or just playing multiplayer. Most of the games are up to date and new. They still have some of your old school arcade games as well. A small bowling alley is located inside and a cool ride inside as well that is extra money. They even have one of those motion rides where you can seat yourself.  Overall, not too bad but still feels like they are missing something."}
{"text":"Ordered a pepperoni and a meathead pizza. Server Sahara was awesome and very attentive. Food was average and as expected.  Great place for the kids to play and have fun when it gets hot out. Better than chuck e cheese by far. One draw back is that there are quite a few games that aren't working which is a bummer when it's the only one but there were several others that were playable."}
{"text":"Offered a yelp check for a free app with purchase of 2 entrees. Game Works would not honor this on fine and play combos.  This seems silly as the dine and play combos do cost more than the entrees. I understand not stacking \"promotions\" but game works is in the business of selling both food and games. We wanted to buy both of their offering. This doesn't seem like a promotion as its any everyday offer."}
{"text":"Went here for a work event and none of the games that we were told we had free access to even worked. Dave and Busters is way better and definately has a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just reopened since the old one closed by the mgm This place would be a cool distraction from a night of gambling They got redemption games some pinball and bowling I'm sure I'll be bringing my kids here"}
{"text":"This is a good place for kids and adults alike (something for everyone) located on The Strip. There are classic video games with seats (pac-man) which is really neat (for those of us who grew up in the 1980s). My favorite is the basketball game (I once outscored my 1st husband- no lie!). There is a cafe and alcohol but I don't think that I've ever had the food, though (hence no comments). Certificates are available for the cafe on www.restaurant.com- check for restrictions. I haven't been here recently but it's a fun family-friendly place. It looks like the unlimited game play at $35 seems to be the best way to go- if you're planning to spend hours there."}
{"text":"I'm not a \"gamer\", but I do enjoy a fun atmosphere, drinking yummy cocktails, and trying new things which is exactly what GameWorks in Town Square offered. Being new to Vegas, I wasn't familiar with GameWorks prior to my visit there or what to expect from it; I was pleasantly surprised with all they had to offer.   The facility itself is HUGE! There are tons and tons of games to play, my favorite was the frog log jump and the Terminator one!! They also have ski ball and a basket ball shooting game. For those of you faithful gamers they even have an entire room set up for online/computer games where you can play til your hearts content while sipping cocktails. My favorite part is their full bowling lanes!!   When you're ready to wet your whistle they also have a large full bar with a full menu. My visit happened to be their second day of being open, so their food was still needing some tweaking, however everything I ate did have great flavor. I am definitely looking forward to giving their menu another try."}
{"text":"After dinner with friends Saturday night, we decided we wanted to see a movie but had time to kill. Thus we decided to hang out at Gameworks. This was my first experience at Gameworks. For the most part, I hung out in the upstairs bar while a few friends played games downstairs. (Well drinks were $5. They had a crazy cocktail menu, but no prices.) I really wanted to play air hockey, but it was broken. My husband played a shoot-em-up and then we played a round of Mario. To play games, you must purchase a game card. The card itself costs $2, then you can load whatever dollar amount you want. I didn't actually purchase the card, so I wasn't sure how many points equaled a dollar, since you use points/credits when you play a game. (Mario was one credit per player, but the claw machine was 13 credits.) Overall, there was a mix of adults and few children actually playing. Some of the machines seemed really old and like they had taken a beating. (Again, a few others were broken or in need of repair.) Overall, it was an easy way to pass the time before a movie but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Need an activity for a group of 8 year olds? GameWorks. Need an activity for your double date with 25 year olds? GameWorks. Need an end of semester class activity? GameWorks.  Before showing up, do a quick Google search and find yourself a deal before you show up. Groupon and even the specials on their websites have some really good deals that will give you a huge discount. For just $20 you can get an entire day of game play and a $20 game card for ticketed games if you find a discount online. It is way more expensive if you buy your ticket on site. Bring the kids here and play in the morning, come back in the evening for date night.  The cards are really easy to lose and non replaceable so either hold on to it for young kids!  GameWorks has a bar and quick bar food. If you come here later in the evening the average age of the crowd gets a lot older. It's located in Town Square so if you're not feeling arcade food, there are TONS of places to eat/drink outside. Park on the West side of Town Square (by the guitar shop and the movie theater)"}
{"text":"I understand that they are still developing the menu here, but whoever is the chef really doesn't understand food.  I ordered the fish and chips, and the breading on the fish was horrible.  One should not be able to describe the fish as flaccid.   The chef needs to add viagra to their dictionary.   Got the chocolate molten cake for desert as that should be hard to screw up, however that was cold and not molten.  I'm not going to describe the words for the cake. I would recommend eating elsewhere and then come here to play games."}
{"text":"My kids are 9 and 6 and I compare this place to John's pizza, Dave & Busters and Peter Piper. I would say that I frequent all of these places because of the age of my kids and they are all pretty close to this location. I purchased the all day pass from Groupon. I paid $20 and it also came with a game card with some additional game coins. The all day game card does not allow you to get tickets for items. I didn't really like that the all day card you can only swipe once a minute because if you have more than 1 person then you have to have 2 cards and each card has a $2 activation. My son was doing most of the playing, but every so often I would want to play the pirate game with him or something and that is a 2 player game. The card says \"Sorry please Wait\" Ugh... The items in the shop look like they would require you to play for a whole week to get 1 thing. Other places you can get a few toys with a little amount of playtime and who doesn't want a toy at the end of all their playing? I know my 6 year old does! The layout is also very cramped. They seem to have packed in as many machines as possible, but did not consider that when people are playing pin ball that there is no room to pass by. This seems to be a fire hazard if you ask me, but we made it through even though I felt a bit claustrophobic at times. I think I spend less at John's pizza and it includes food that is not just pizza. John's is still my favorite and it has a more open layout so you don't lose your kids as much. We didn't eat because there are so many other options in Town Square especially for kids."}
{"text":"Man this place has gone down. I remember when this was the spot but now It is run down with a lot of broken games. I went today with my brothers and we were very disappointed. It was around 11 and there were beer bottles around the games downstairs. Oh and since when did they start charging taxes on game card refills?"}
{"text":"Great place for people of all ages, to come and have a fun time! The food is good and service is great! If you wants cocktail while the kids play, indulge yourself with a drink! If bowling is your thing come and bowl, if Xbox one or playstation 4 or computer gaming! GameWorks is your place to have fun!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to take the kids to after visiting M&M World and Coca Cola. It can get a little pricey to eat and play here but the kids really seemed to enjoy it."}
{"text":"I've been to several arcades and this one is one of the best. In order to play a game, you purchase credits which go on a game card. We bought a $20 card which gave us 105 credits. Most good / great games take an average of 7-11 credits. So you don't really get to play much arcade games, not to mention at the gift shop you cannot purchase any souvenirs because everything can only be bought by the tickets you earned. That was a bummer, for me. Overall it's okay, but not sure we would go back unless there's nothing really to do."}
{"text":"First they are CLOSED. This review is on the way they closed. Called all their employees in one day and told them they were closing. No notice, no severance. This is an aweful way to treat people. If they re open, please remember the way they treated their employees. Someone knew it, it couldn't have been that last minute, pure disrespect."}
{"text":"Oh how the mighty have fallen.  Was brought here when I was younger and was never disappointed by the amount of games or type of games that GameWorks had to offer. I felt that they were always a step ahead of what a video arcade should have.  Those days are long gone. Went here recently to enjoy the nostalgia of my youth with my younger brother and sister and was VASTLY disappointed. What was once a video game paradise has now become a shell of its former self. Gone are the days of  cutting edge games in this two story building. Now, the upstairs has become a bar/banquet center and the downstairs has about 75% of the games it used to have. Bought a 20 dollar card and didn't even use up the whole thing.  If you're looking for what GameWorks used to be, don't waste the gas."}
{"text":"Terrible experience.  Got the groupon for our daughter.  The last time we were there was 2 years ago, and fun was had by all.  This time, sadly a bad experience.  Half the games were posted out of order, or reported a software issue and were not usable.  Several postings about corporate retreats.  How about using that money to upgrade and/or refurbish.  Will look to D&B on future trips.  Thumbs down."}
{"text":"I love GAMEWORKS :)   Every time I go to Vegas I never fail to come to this place & spend hours and hours of playing!  You also get fair kind of prizes from your tickets.. (that you usually don't get from typical arcade places)  If you love chocolates, you can just go next door at M&M factory! It is also a walking distance from the MGM Grand which is our favorite hotel to stay in."}
{"text":"Located in Town Square on Las Vegas Blvd, just South of the Famous Las Vegas Strip. This is an arcade for kids and adults alike. It looks like a great place to throw a party. Although the food is ok, just ok, I had the pizza, it was about the same price as one you could get at CPK, and not nearly as good. But still a fun place and they have a decent happy hour. So I say stop in and try your hand at ski ball. Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"You would think since this is the only real arcade joint left in Vegas, and the fact that it's big, That they would at least try and keep their games functional. What the heck! I hate paying for a game of Marvel vs Capcom 2 and than finding that some of the buttons aren't even working. It's just a simple cherry switch replacement that takes about 2 minutes to fix. Seriously. Come on. It's like they purposely don't want people to coe back. Or maybe it's the fact they know most their customers are tourists and that those people will never come back a second time anyways. Half the games don't even work, and the ones that do have something wrong with them. Shame on you Gameworks people, Shame on you. Oh and I forgot to mention, most the games they have are over a decade old. get some new games. I know arcades are almost extinct, but geez, give us a reason to wish they weren't."}
{"text":"The place is cool, the games are great    the food is disgusting  The customer service poor   It is hands-down the worst food I've never ordered. Salty bruschetta, salty disgusting calamari, nachos with nothing on them  I've never had worst food served to me on a consistent basis"}
{"text":"A fine way to spend a few hours when you're sick of walking the strip and tired of smoky casinos. The pricing system made no sense to me (you purchase $10 of credit on a swipe card with a $2 processing fee, kinda crappy) but it was a fun time. Options for ticket redemption were totally lame. Why have them at all?"}
{"text":"How disappointing! I probably will not come back to this GameWorks. Half the games were out of order, the place smelled really gross, and it is relatively small compared to Dave and Buster's. The staff is great but when you come to an arcade, you probably expect most of the machines to work.  I don't recommend."}
{"text":"Where's Ms. Pacman gone?!?  Added stars because its still a great place to hang with my grown kids at decent prices.  Minus stars because theres no more Ms. Pacman/Galaga and many of the games have joysticks that don't work right.  Add stars for the refreshing Mango Passion cocktail and friendly bartenders  :)"}
{"text":"Double Decker Challenge ($14.99) @Gameworks   Finish this one pound burger and they'll give you a $10 game play card  That's that know me, know I'm always up for a food challenge and one that pays you to play I game:)  Gameworks is always a blast and the Cafe has great food my last trip we tried the BBQ and was pleasantly surprised to experience some of the BEST in #Vegas.  Hankering for a burger-I noticed on the menu they had a CHALLENGE!! Conquer the #1 pound Double Decker & get a $10 game card-how could I pass on that?  The burger was cooked perfectly medium-rare charred around the edges with a great bun. I'm not gonna lie I prepared for this challenge with PEDs but even that didn't HELP!! The burger was really tasty but 1/2 way in I knew I had been beat:(  If you are visiting Las #Vegas or a local looking for a fun time & great Happy Hour Specials check out @Gameworks on the STRIP!!"}
{"text":"First time in a long time since I came back to Gameworks. The last time I've been here was when they had one on the strip next to M&M World.  I've seen nothing new except the bowling and they have billards.  It looked similar to Insert Coins.  Because they have a bar and gaming consoles for you to play on too.  I didn't like the new payment method where you have to get a prepaid card to swipe to play a game.  I like the old fashion pay with quarters.  I like they have an internet cafe where you can LAN party with your friends.  All in all, it's not that bad."}
{"text":"allow me to join the chorus of \"what happened to this place?\"s.  my first visit, about 15(!) years ago, was quickly followed by several more because the place was a lot of fun.  in the intervening time, yes, i've changed a bit - but Gameworks has changed more, and not in a good way.  most of the games here dispense tickets, quickly followed by a raft of mediocre racing simulators that are from a generation or two ago.  a lot of the semi-unique things i might've tried are \"under repair.\"  maybe most disappointingly, there are only four real vintage games - and their CRTs are in bad shape.  Gameworks is something i used to look forward to visiting when i was in this area, not so much because i think it's a great place but for the memories.  well, no use now - it's a shell of its former self.  best to leave what good memories remain untainted, stay that way.  (note:  if you're taking little kids, it might be pretty good.  i wouldn't guess 5 stars for that even, though.)"}
{"text":"Arcade fun that ranks up there with the best Vegas has to offer, with the price tag to match. I could easily end the review here and feel like I covered the very basic gist of what this place is all about, but allow me to get a bit more in-depth-- starting with a very short background story.   GameWorks is no stranger to Sin City, having held open a Strip-side location that saw early success, but ultimately couldn't make ends meet. After a substantial hiatus, they once again returned, this time making their home in Town Square.   After enjoying this location since its opening, I can safely say this was mutually a good decision on their part-- for myself and their business. Traffic rarely wanes during the summer, even on weekdays. The location itself is more suited for locals since parking is easier to come by than the Strip location, and traffic is far less of an issue. The single-level design of the arcade might be a point of contention for quite a few who knew the old GameWorks, but I find it a lot easier to navigate.  The games themselves are decently maintained, not to the scope that certain Round 1s I've been to are, but enough that on any given day that few machines, if any, will ever be out of service during operating hours.  The staff are generally attentive to most needs in my experience, but things of that nature are VERY different between person to person and your mileage will vary.  Prices for menu and bar items are about what you'd expect. The menu has improved quite a bit over time, but the options wouldn't be enough to entice the truly picky from other offerings within walking distance. It's bar food for casual bites, not a Zagat-rated establishment.  The hidden jewel of this place, however, is not the bowling alley, restaurant area, Dark Ride or the redemption counter-- it lies within the E-Sports center. Rows of consoles and gaming PCs await to satisfy the needs of more at-home gamers, with frequent community events for certain games to give the place a sense of being a hub for all that's happening in the world of competitive gaming. Of all the areas in this arcade, this one has always felt the most welcoming too.  All that, and you can order food and alcohol in the E-Sports area (provided you are of legal age). Imagine all of the drunk Mario Kart games you could have with your friends...  All in all, GameWorks has become a bit of a cornerstone in the gaming scene here, and it's not going anywhere. With its central location, great entertainment options and cozy E-Sports center, it's well-suited for players of all levels, casual and competitive."}
{"text":"My boys, ages 11 and 17 got all day game cards (10 hours of game play) and were there on a Wednesday, got there when they opened at 11A, but there already was a summer camp group of kids playing, still it wasn't too crowded not to have plenty of games to choose from.  A few games were broken, but there were so many others to choose from.  We stayed there 5 hours and boys still weren't ready to leave because they still had 5 more hours of game play left!  We left anyway because I was tired and hungry.  We will definitely come back, great place to bring kids and just let them have fun."}
{"text":"The first few games we tried had broken controls so we played more of the circus games that you can win tickets to redeem for little trinkets. Those brought back memories of going to the carnival when I was little. My teenage son  decided to go the gaming section which features online computer role playing. the price at 5 per hour seemed very reasonable.  Decided to have lunch at the restaurant. It is inside of Gameworks with open walls so you hear the machines and excitment of kids and adults. There are also multiple tv screens showing various sports programs. The food was pricy for the two items choose, buffalo chicken wrap and fish and chips $25 but it was a decent portion. Just enough to feed three, not so hungry, people.  Overall the area was nice and clean. The bathrooms were clean also."}
{"text":"first visit to this location at Town Square last time I went to Gameworks, it used to be a huge location by the MGM  had to meet a client here.....yes she had kids, so had to keep them busy!  this location was a lot smaller than the one that was by the MGM, but was a good place to meet....especially since they have alcohol!  ordered a pretty pathetic looking pizza, with game card of course! ....looked bad, but the kids scarfed it down, so who am I to judge, right?  for adults, we ordered a salad with ranch....just ok a philly cheesesteak sandwhich....again, just ok, meat kind of dry and a spinach artichoke dip, again just ok  service was good, and we got to let the kiddies run amok in the game area, so that made it nice  don't think I would come here aside from needing to keep kids occupied though wasn't anything special food wise, but they do have a full bar, so that is a plus"}
{"text":"I had fonder memories of this place...I went over Halloween weekend with a bunch of friends because it was too early for any nightlife to begin. A lot of the games I wanted to play were broken (including all of the Time Crisis systems), some shooting games had messed up light guns, the air hockey tables were out of service, the list goes on. I also managed to shut off the escalator as we were leaving...but that's not a fault of Gameworks.  Definitely not as fun the second time around, but maybe that's because I'm now a little older and a little wiser. There was one saving grace though, the dinosaur hunting game. You walk around hunting various breeds of dinosaur, and you even get a rocket launcher for when the SHTF. The other not-so-bad was the driving game with 4 big-screen TVs."}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food and drinks, ask for Zack for your special events.  We organized a party of twenty 12 year olds for our daughters 12th Bday party and had half the venue for our group. Will definitely come back for more parties including adult group events."}
{"text":"I was a kid when Gameworks first opened at Arizona Mills and it was a magical place. There were some really great interactive games that blew my mind: A game where you're strapped in a seat and you can rise up to the second story of the building as you try to pop other people's hot air balloons, a motion-detecting combat game, a huge bank of race cars for a racing game.  It's no longer magical. It's best not to know these games used to exist, because Gameworks is now just a large, average arcade with a LOT of broken games.  My companion and I bought Groupons for all-day passes and ultimately it wasn't really worth it. It seemed like up to 1/3 of the games were broken and the most interactive games they had (aside from the shooting/racing games where you hold or get on something) were Rock Band-esque games and DDR. Old news. We played for a couple hours at best and then gave our passes to a parent and his kid. It seemed like they'd enjoy them more than we did.  I'll choose to remember Gameworks for what it was and not what it is."}
{"text":"Love bringing the kids here except for the experience w having a MALE janitor walking into the bathroom to clean WHILE there were 7+ young girls using the bathroom! They all stopped when they saw the man come in and you could see the worried look on their faces. I reported it right away and I hope they did something about it! I never want my young high school and middle school girls in a bathroom while a man is trying to clean it up!"}
{"text":"I was at the bar and served by this red headed bartender. So unprofessional. There were no other customers at the moment, very slow thru out the day, but she definitely seemed like she didnt want to be there. Put no effort in making my drink. Has this girl not heard of customer service or manners before?  I would have kept my tab open if she had been less rude."}
{"text":"nick was pretty much the best part exports Robby got my game set up so fast I played drunk Mario kart and had the time of my life thank god this place exist"}
{"text":"My kids love to come here. They have a lot of games and is very clean. employers are really profesional and friendly."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?    I remember coming her when it opened many years ago and even as an adult the place was jaw dropping.  Remember that game that took you up a few stories into the air?  I remember GameWorks having the top of the line of any video game out there.  On the bottom floor, you could play anything that was new to the industry and on the second floor, you could play the vintage games like Frogger and Pacman.  I get that the arcade industry has changed, but I guess I had no idea how much..  I was just here last night while waiting to see a movie and when I walked in, it felt as if I stepped into Peter Piper Pizza.  Tons of skiball, basketball, dance dance revolution, karaoke, guitar hero.. They had some of the old games there, but it just looked like GameWorks jumped the shark and was trying to now be a place where you could play console games.    I just wasn't impressed...  Also the food there isnt the greatest."}
{"text":"Love this place. Plenty of games. Not too crowded. But 5 stars are earned for customer service. My son left his iPad there. Not only was it turned in, but the manager delivered it to our hotel."}
{"text":"Ultimate fail for not having Jurassic Park: The Lost World functional! My friends and I needed our dinosaur fix, but you deprived us of it!  At least DDR was more enjoyable, especially after seeing a random drunk person challenge one of my friends to a round of DDR.  The next time I come here, Jurassic Park better be operational or else: I will not be pleased :("}
{"text":"Me and my family had a great time in Gameworks located at the heart of Town Square mall. The service was phenomenal. My waitress, Taylor, was very attentive with our needs like refills, napkins, extra such and such. I appreciate it so much since even though they were so busy, they manage to take care of us in a superb level. The food was phenomenal. They have really good selection on their finger foods. Porky Joe's and Carnival Chicken sandwich was to die for. With some yukon fries topped with blue cheese crumbles and bacon was definitely a treat. I would also like thank the manager, Ron. He came to our table to check and ensure that we have been highly taken care of.  It was really welcoming here. I will surely come back for more."}
{"text":"Horrible, overpriced, dirty and most of the games are broken. The prizes are not even worth trying to win. The food is discusting aswell. I really expected alot more than this. The old gameworks on the strip was so much better. NEVER stepping foot in this place again and I don't reccomend anyone to stop by here. I thought all these reviews were exaggerating but trust me they are not. I was so dissapointed I left and just went to the NEW YORK NEW YORK Arcade."}
{"text":"They have a plethora of games, including a lot of old school arcade games! It looks a little run down, but it was fun to go there and be a kid again."}
{"text":"Overall, not very impressed. The previous strip location had so much more to offer and it was a letdown to see how very little this new location had. The prices for all the games also seemed quite unreasonable and it was even more disappointing when almost half of the games were down for maintenance."}
{"text":"One of the many arcades that Las Vegas. This one is pretty big; however, this one is pretty old compared to many other ones. The games are very old and most times there will be a few games that can't be played. What's good about this place is that they use a card to hold credits and amount of time instead of using like tokens or quarters.  One more good thing about this place is that it's underground below the scorching heat of Las Vegas.   Staff really sucks here and don't really want to help you. When my card wouldn't swipe properly, one of the female staff was like \"You sure??!! If it works when I do it, then I will be very mad at you!\" with a really bitchy attitude."}
{"text":"Another successful BDay party at Gameworks. Want to thank our host Lorenzo, party coordinators, and Tommy for making it an awesome BDay party. If your kiddo have food sensitivities, this is a place to come for a party."}
{"text":"We got the unlimitepd card and the kids loved it! We spent all day in here.  Gives my AC a rest lol.  Its a nice family spot.  A lot of (pre)teenagers hang out too without supervision but they all seemed well behaved."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday and felt let down. Years and years ago it was awesome! Then I noticed it started to transition to a budgeted arcade. I saw some games there that I saw about 5-7 years ago which is good, but unfortunately, those games are the ones the no one plays. Over the past decade, most of the games I played have disappeared and the less popular ones still exist.  It has turned into a quiet (people traffic) place, with several broken games. Even some games that were not out of order had broken/defective controls. Maybe its a money thing or issue, but Gameworks, you really need to have quality control. Have your employees test run the games every so often and ask your managers to interact with your guests and get their opinions so you can bring back the glory that this place once had.   Dave and Busters is kicking your butt and it doesn't appear that you care. Please please please don't let your business and this location turn to dust. It's not a bad location at all but I'm fearful that you'll have to shut down at this rate.  I didn't eat here this visit, but I never had a problem with your food. I did however take advantage of your bar happy hour. The beer was a little flat, but just like the rest of your facility, improve it cosmetically and tweak a few things and your business will be stronger. Shouldn't take much to transition this rundown place to a gem."}
{"text":"GameWorks is one of my favorite places to go if I want a fun, casual evening with friends. I definitely enjoy playing Skee Ball, air hockey, and other arcade games while having an adult beverage. It's like Chuck E. Cheese for adults, except there are also kids too. Because there are kids, you probably shouldn't try to get tanked here, but they don't create a distraction or prevent adults from having a good time. There's a solid variety of games for all tastes.  The food is equal to above average bar food, which is fine by my standards. The real reason for ordering food is so I can get the Dine & Play combo, the best deal by far. The combo lets you get certain entrees plus a one hour ($15.99) or two hour ($21.99) game card. I'd pay those prices merely for the card, so throwing in an entree on top makes the combo a great deal. It's much cheaper than paying the cash rate. The game card doesn't let you earn tickets, but you can still play most of the ticket games without earning. I don't care about winning a stuffed bear, so that's not a problem.  Drink a beer. Kill some zombies. Race a motorcycle."}
{"text":"Like this location way better than the old one. They need more games and to bring down the price for them. Most important Kids had a great time!"}
{"text":"This is solely the review for the food. I was meeting friends here to watch the Lakers game. Not my first choice, but whatever.   I got the ribs dinner with 2 sides for $10. Good deal actually, or so I thought. At first glance, the ribs just fell off the bone, which is a good sign of cooked ribs. Taste wise, it had no flavor at all. It looked big, but the portions was actually small once you take out all the ribs.   The mash potatoes just suck. I couldn't quiet put my finger on what it tasted like. It certainly didn't taste like potatoes at all. I wonder if they use the mash potatoes mix. I just ate it because I knew I was going to need energy for walking the strip later.  The fries wasn't anything special. You can do better getting fries from the frozen food isle and frying it up yourself.    I guess you get what you pay for.  Food came out in about 10 minutes. I got a steak knife, but no napkins or a fork. I don't think it be a smart idea to eat mash potatoes with a steak knife.  Food is your typical bar food, that just isn't good. Happy hour makes the prices better, but the food still taste bad. I forgot this place uses Restauraunt.com, so I could have gotten a cheaper meal. The only good thing that happened at this place was the Lakers won!"}
{"text":"Wasnt very impressed by this place. I have been here a couple times to get a drink with my girlfriend and play those ticket games. This time i decided to have some food and sit at a table. The server only had 5 tables total to watch over and he was extremely slow. We ordered the nacho appetizer and some egg rolls. The nachos came out at a decent time but the rolls came out after we were about finished eating. We had to wait another 20 mins for the waiter to get back with our bill so we could leave. Not a very fun experience. I think i might just take my money and go to a local bar instead"}
{"text":"Last night we celebrated my husband's nephew's birthday here, per his request. The establishment is located in Town Square on the ground floor, right under the AMC Theater. There is ample parking in Town Square and the meters are used to collect donations, not to enforce parking fees, in short - your car won't get towed if you don't have change to spare.   We arrived on a Thursday night at 615 pm. The dining area was practically empty apart from our party, party of 21. We occupied about five tables, but only three tables were ready to order when the wait-service came around. I was a little confused because we saw several servers and yet only one came by to take our orders. After he was done taking orders at one table, he went back to put the orders in, and took a while doing it too, and then came back for the next table. This went on until it was our turn to order, mind you we were the last table.   I didn't mind that he was taking a while to get our orders but, we didn't get our water/beverages till after. I saw that he was rushing around and walking with a purpose (the dining area is kind of big). What killed me in the end was waiting for our food to come out and finally getting our check and game cards.   I ordered the Cobb Salad which is a 1-hour Game Card item, the Classic Quesadilla with chicken for my kids to share- thats another 1-hour Game Card item, my husband had the Seared Salmon, and we had wings to share-buffalo style. Overall, the food was good. I probably wouldn't come back just to eat the food, as nothing really stood out. We were here to play games after all.   BTW the special from Mon-Fri is that they give you 1-hour game cards when you order the game card specific items from their menu. That was a no brainer for me since my kids have too many toys at home and I didn't want them bringing more \"prizes\" home. It was about 830 pm by the time we finally checked out and received our game cards. I Checked-In on Yelp and registered/signed up for the Game Works program, so I received a coupon for a free $10 game card + 25 Bonus Points, a manager had to come around and verify my phone number in order to redeem the coupon since I didn't print it out. So of course, that took some time as well.   1-hour of gaming is a lot of time when you are with a 6 yr old and 3 yr old. I would recommend this Mon-Friday happy hour deal to anyone who doesn't mind not being able to win tickets. Not all games are ticket.   I did a quick restroom trip, it seemed clean enough-there is also a gender neutral restroom for families. I spied a bowling alley, a couple pool tables, a private party room, and a bar. Cool place to bring the entire family."}
{"text":"I just can't find my way into giving 5 stars to a place that co-mingles alcohol and children. Having said that, I am an adult that likes to obtain the occasional cocktail, and I was pleasantly surprised with the level of service from what I can easily see as a great bartender: Erica Gueco. She was nice, personable, amiable, and attentive to my needs, all while expertly handling of the needs of the many other patrons. She is a credit to this establishment and a great person to have on the front lines. Though, with all the great food joints perched so closely to this place, and the general lack of consistency I've experienced here as far as the menu goes, I would have to say pass on the food. Just get drinks, from Erica if you're lucky."}
{"text":"Prepare to be dissapointed! Ooh Vegas, you gotta stay away from this one, if you want to wait for your food, wait for your drinks, and keep waiting for service this is the place to be! One star for service, 2nd star earned because there's fun stuff to do after you're done waiting, lol. The place wasn't even as crowded as you would expect, I think because the word is out on the place already, and i got there at 8:50pm to eat, way past the dinner rush and the popular 6-7:30 dinner rush. One and a half hour meal and drinks could have been finished in about half that time, just spent too much time waiting. Me and Gary Z preordered our next drink because the first drink took half an hour to get the first one, lol. At least 35 min to even take our order for food. It's a 2.5 star establishment for a reason people! Don't get your hopes up just because they reopened."}
{"text":"This place is fun, I got a great deal on Groupon and was like heck yeah I'm 30 and I don't care if I'm seen playing them arcade games all day for free lol!!! I like the environment. I bought me one of my hometowns IPA beers which is 10 barrel at the bar there. Had a great time with family and friends."}
{"text":"The food was not that great and when we went back from playing a few games are food and drinks were gone even after we said we were not finish and the place is more for adults due the drinking even though i spoke to management my drinks were remade in smaller glass and said they remake are food but i dais so you could just but it in the trash the chicken tasted freezer burned and I told the management that if you do go there dont order the chicken"}
{"text":"We had my son Jakes birthday party here, a little costly but worth it.  The girl talking care of the party was slow, and uninterested, not very engaging with the kids, just talked to employees and texted on her cell phone. Sharice .  That's the only disappointment since coming here.   We had a great bartender at the party in the bowling room.   I've seen the same bartender there everytime I go.  He's African American with a goatie, sit in his section and order a Moscow Mule!  I'm a connoisseur of Moscow Mules (lol) and he makes them better than Mandarin Oriental, Wynn, all the top places in Vegas who have them on their specialty menu.  The perfect amount of alcohol to spice, taste incredible!  Great place to let your kids run amuck while you drink at the bar and order food.  I definitely recommend this place for birthday parties, regardless of the girl who hosted my sons party.  Looking forward for my sons 9th"}
{"text":"So going to have to side with the majority of ratings now and give only 2 stars. I was definitely expecting more since it moved from the MGM location to Town Square. I personally think the old location had more to offer and that this one needs more \"punch\" to really get people in. There was not enough newer games out on the floor and I can see that they are trying to copy Dave & Busters theme. A lot of dated machines and maybe they can add some pool tables in the dining area to give other options. I left a little underwhelmed and hope they do more with the space."}
{"text":"first time here and it was OK. the place smelled real bad, like urine, especially the elevator. service was okay, we had to call the guy over a few times. they didn't even check on us. wings were good, bbq chicken pizza was good except for the fact that it was over powered by a whole bunch of garlic cloves. ugh, i love garlic cloves but man, there was too much on there. the cool thing though is that they have that asian photobooth thing and a karaoke booth!"}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the place. Food was ok, games are way too expensive.  You can always have a fun night at an arcade, but it's too crowded and games take way too many credits ($) for what they are."}
{"text":"Cons. Kinda pricey , limited floor space for the games. The restaurant area looks incredibly mundane and bland. I honestly think whoever designed this place was having a indentity crisis . I just feel like they don't know what they wanna be.    Pros. A couple decent games. My son is 6 so he was impressed! Lol staff was nice and helpful. Well ventilated for all the people inside.    Overall it needs work, needs more floor games, still something to take the kids to do in this town you cant beat that . If it gets better I'll def come back"}
{"text":"Alysia with a heart and not a . Over the I.  I felt uncomfortable at first but her friendly demeaned made me at home.  A county fair inside.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"this place is SO awful. they were such a rip off. overpriced and dirty and every arcade machine was out of order. we got a free entree with our passes and we asked for them to go, the chef got mad that HE forgot to put them in to go boxes and just threw the cookie and ice cream in boxes (left) and a stale, dry cake (right). do NOT go here. it's such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Gamesworks is a large arcade and rock climbing place on the strip.  Pretty good sized, could spend a couple of hours being occupied.  You pay by a game card, not tokens.  A few fast food/grill type eateries."}
{"text":"Rami, absolutely gorgeous girl with the blue hair running the cash register totally made my night. She was used to the E-sports center but was at the register today, and let me tell you, it was stressful but she handled it with ease. She kept conversation and was mindful of my birthday and Groupon promotions and honored both. She was just a great conversationalist and honestly should be in management for how she handles situations. Definitely would want her on board with my business, that's for sure. Also, Manager Troy was more than accommodating with everything throughout the evening. He made sure my girls left with an even amount of prizes. Bless his heart, because that would not be a fun car ride home.   There were a few games out of order, and I mentioned it to the front and they sent attendants out to fix the issue in no time. Excellent customer service.   Tyler, at the bar, thank you for your understanding and outstanding customer service. My friend had ordered a whiskey smash, but it tasted more like a strawberry lemonade on the dollar menu at Del Taco. We mentioned it to Tyler and he apologized for the other bartenders error and remade a Jack N Coke, since that is what usually gets the job done. Tyler was very helpful and made adult time, much more enjoyable and worth it.   Can't wait to come back, KID FREE!!"}
{"text":"Love the LAN gaming section of gameworks! They have all the new generation consoles plus great running PCs for all your online LAN gaming needs!  They serve drinks from the bar inside the gaming lounge which is really convenient. They also have a decent happy hour after 9pm. I usually go with my girlfriend at least once a week we really enjoy it!  Haven't used the other part of gameworks at all. Seems like its way to bunched together they need to open up the dining area to more games I never see anyone using the dining room anyways. Just my thoughts!"}
{"text":"Maybe we just went on a bad day last December when everything was closing early due to snow. However, they had some cool games but it would have been crazy to pay for a full day when we could only play for two hours.   The bathrooms were disgusting and the entire place smelled of raw sewage. I felt like I was in the French Quarter in New Orleans!"}
{"text":"I bought my all day pass at Tix 4 Tonight for $20 instead of the regular $35, and this was a plus.  Playing for several hours as much as I wanted was definitely worth the $20 that I spent.  That said, I would never go back.  The entire time I was there, the place smelled awful, almost as if the bathroom had exploded and there was sewage all over the place.  In response to this, the management decided to just spray bathroom spray to try to cover up the stench.  Unfortunately, the management didn't realize that you shouldn't spray aerosol in somewhat enclosed areas without proper ventilation.    The management seemed ambivalent to this and said there was nothing they could do about the odor besides spray to try to cover it up.  Conclusion: Don't pay full price for the all-day pass.  Bring your own bathroom spray."}
{"text":"Had fun when I came to visit from Los Angeles. However too many kids and most machines were out of order near the bar area."}
{"text":"Brought my 3 children here on a Friday night. It is  loud so be prepared.  We originally bought 2 cards with $20 on them. After 10 minutes I realized they would be out of money real quick SO I inquired on the food and play option ($15 for an hour with one food item or $22 for 2 hrs and one food item) . You have to order select food, pay and then you can get your card. We were not hungry but since they wouldn't just sell me a card for the time, I ordered a pizza to go and brought it out to my car. With the hour/ 2 hour card it is simply good for playing. You do not collect \"tickets\" or points. I wish they would simply offer time ( no points) or per credit ( tickets earned) without having to order food.  The \"prizes\" are ok. I like that you can save the card and continue to save the points."}
{"text":"The E-Sports section is the true gem of Gameworks. $4 an hour (when you spend $20), tons of games on PC, XBox One, PS4  & Wii U, and discounted prices on food.   Amazing value for lots of family fun!"}
{"text":"Before I continue, I would like to say that this review is regarding only the arcade portion of this GameWorks. After hearing everyone's excitement about the new GameWorks opening up and seeing the sign posted inside of TownSquare for over a year, I thought this place was going to be spectacular. I was definitely let down.   First of all, the space for the games is just too small. You could run through them all in just a couple of hours. That is, if you get a chance to play them at all. It's always crowded with so many people and sometimes you'll find parents just taking up the chairs for the games to watch their children play.  Second, not only are the cards/points extremely overpriced for an arcade but, the self help kiosks don't even work and when we went to inform the employees at the ticket counter, they just shrugged and said \"They never work\".  This brings me to another point, a lot of the games are ALREADY broken! Why pay so much money for all of these points if everything is shut down? Ridiculous.  Lastly, if your children play enough games to earn enough points for a certain prize that they want, don't let them get too excited. A couple of my friends spent just enough money to win enough tickets to get the LEGO pillow that they've been eyeing for a while. As soon as they reached the 1,500 ticket mark, they went to redeem their prize. Then, the employees told them they don't even have the LEGO pillows in stock. Though a few different colors of them were hanging on the walls.  I wish they could just open up a reasonably priced arcade. From now on, I'm sticking to the Pinball Hall of Fame."}
{"text":"This is not the quality that I expected to come of GameWorks.  *Purchased an all day pass that had errors reading the card so the card had to be replaced.  *The advertised 24 hour unlimited play on Groupon card only works for 14 hours.  *The staff was very young and inexperienced with customer service.  *Beware that many games have malfunction issues. In the three occasions that I have gone to this GameWorks, multiple machines can be found with error messages."}
{"text":"What a great place to take kids for a couple of hours while in Vegas!  It was clean and well-managed and the service was exceptional. Rami took especially good care of us (one of my youngest was scared on the 3D ride and she stopped it, took him off and then restarted it for my other kids so they didn't miss a thing). And when a game didn't work, they took care of it right away. Even the toys you buy with tickets are better quality then most in places like this."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. 50% of the games are out of service. I'm taking my business to D & Bs"}
{"text":"Fuck GameWorks. It sucks. Arcade games are old and broken. Video game system sucks. Rental system uses stupid collateral system. Fucking card system sucks. Fucking GameWorks sucks."}
{"text":"With the name GameWorks you'd think their games would work.... came here with my bf to play the basketball shooting game since he lost last time we played at SouthPoint arcade. Tried to play the game and his machine worked while mine didn't. I had to play on another one so I was basically on the other end. Then we moved over to play the football throwing game and they only had 2 machines. 1 of them didn't work. It started getting irritating. We didn't even use all our credits, we ended up just leaving to walk around the mall. Either take the machines that don't work out or fix them."}
{"text":"Come here on a weekday! It's a lot less crowded and the service is a bit better. We decided to take my niece and nephew here on a Saturday night and it was really packed. We wanted to get the unlimited game card but you have to dine in to get the deal. I really wish they would just sell the cards without meals coz we didn't really want to eat there. We had to so we did. We went up to the hostess and told her we were a party of 5 wanting to do the dine and play. She said it would be a 20-30 minute wait and we said it was fine. She didn't ask for our name or anything so my husband had asked her if she needed our name and she was like oh yeah and grabbed a random paper. She took our name down and our number and said they'll call when a table was ready. So we walk around outside for a bit and when the 30 minutes was up we came back and checked in with the hostess. We waited another 10 minutes then we were finally sat. It seemed like they were short on people. We were sat for quite a bit when a manager finally took our order. The food was ok. We got the nachos and pizza. After that whole process, we finally got our game cards so the kids could play. Nearly all the machines and games were in use. You kind of had to stand by the game you wanted to play and wait for whoever was using it to finish so you can play it next for sure. There was a good selection of games for the small space. I think the kids had fun in the end but they were miserable having to wait for the restaurant and the food and that whole process of getting the game card."}
{"text":"Its alright, reminds me of boomers, with bigger better games, the prizes are ok.. but its super loud in there, and mostly guys..I think I was the only girl who was playing shooting games, yay shooting zombies.. the prizes are mostly from Sega. Yes, they do have UFO catchers but they are not like the ones in Japan, they are a little different.. and its not easy to win..I am so mad it is two dollars one freaking grab and I almost lost all my money. I hate the card system and they charge you an extra two dollars to make a new card wtff rippp offf. Excalibur please"}
{"text":"I was honestly expecting a lot more from these guys having been to the original GameWorks on the Strip. First off, let me start off with the arcade game selection. Not much of a looker. Compared to the old GameWorks, the selection is a fraction of what used to be and half the games weren't functioning correctly either. Also the useless bar/restaurant area composes half of this GameWorks. That's right, they put more effort into building an eatery rather than getting decent GAMES. The E-Sports arena was pretty decent and the bowling area looked cool as well.  Be prepared to spend at least $20+ if you wish to have a decent experience as the GameWorks cards no longer work by hours. They work by a points system instead and the games range between 4-11 points. Overall, these guys need improvement if they wish to retain their former glory."}
{"text":"We had our company party here & we had a great time. The food was amazingly delicious:  -chicken wings -Caesar and Cobb salads  -Sliders  -Fries  -Pizza (kids favorite)  Our host did an excellent job in making sure our party had everything we needed. And Ron (the manager) took great care of us.   The 2 hour game cards are a must to get. Yes u can't play the ticket games but our kids still had a lot of fun with all the many other choices there was. Definitely would have my kids bday party here and gonna plan our company party again next year."}
{"text":"Rule #1 Never Come on a weekend Rule #2 Expect to wait for a game   So I've been here a few times and I'm a fan. I don't care much for kids so I know not to come during the weekend. I love playing video games and love to drink, I'm in heaven because this place has both. I can't say anything about the food because I've never had it. I can say that the service is either hit or miss, most of the bartenders are really really nice I've had 1 bartender a really pretty asian girl with a bad attitude but other than that I can't complain. I typically have a beer on draft and they are always very cold and the prices aren't bad. I always go for the Groupon special $20 for the all day pass because I could spend Hours playing games. Keep in mind that Game Works is not a big place so Yes you will have to wait for a game or two. This is a great place to come during the week and kill some time while having a few cold ones."}
{"text":"The arcade in Gameworks has a lot of variety it seems like a very fun atmosphere you get good credits and enough to play almost every game once for $20 so this I really enjoy. As for Gameworks food... They have horrible service. I ordered three separate items and out of the three separate items I received only two then on top of all of that they didn't give me any napkins,ketchup or any other condiments the table was completely blank I didn't get my napkins until I was halfway through my food and the waitress saw that my hands were greasy. Overall Gameworks is a good arcade place but I as for the food service They should really pay a lot of attention to it.if Gameworks wants to compete with Dave and busters they they are very low on that totem pole they need a lot of work."}
{"text":"Oh Gameworks! I have been here a couple of times but I finally got to try the food and drinks. The food wasn't bad at all. We had a sliders trio and loaded fries! Our alcoholic drinks (blueberry martini and Moscow mule) were terrible and tasted like rubbing alcohol. The prices for the food was reasonable.  On to the games: They have this crazy LAN center that takes up way too much space. This place is always crowded and none of the games are available and when they are they are sooooooo fun!  Overall, this is a cute date night place and stray away from the drinks unless it's a beer :)"}
{"text":"A little disappointed with GameWorks. Granted I haven't had any alcohol or food there yet, so they might still be able to earn a star, but..   It was pretty big for where it was located. There is a bar, restaurant, bowling lanes, a computer game room, and a tiny, tiny counter in front of the prize area. Not to mention a pretty large area of general games.   Opening was fun. They had a little deal going on for $12 that was pretty sweet.  Now, I know that a lot of little kiddies come to TS to play and such, but the kind of games that were there...it was a little disappointing. I expected way better games and a better variety. Of course, some games were closed because they weren't giving out prizes or tickets at opening, but that was to be expected given the foot traffic they got. Though, I thought they would at least have a small raffle or something~!   Some of the best things that were there were the shooting games, racing games, the virtual reality roller coaster pod, and the 4D Haunted House game!"}
{"text":"Nice place to take your kids to have fun! But I do not recommend the food nasty AF did not eat any of it! Party of 8 none of us ate the food! 3 stars for the arcade"}
{"text":"Had a blast with the girls today. Used my gift card that I purchased from a fundraiser for 2 hrs of swipe and play. The only thing that irritated me was that every time i swiped.. I had to wait like a few min to be able to swipe again at another game! I will be back to use the other Card i have with my girls!!   **Suggestion** Please include cell phone charging station. --thank you :)"}
{"text":"I guess I wasn't the biggest fan of this place when I last came to las vegas in April, but I do have fond memories being here when I was about 18 years old.  I was just pissed that most of these freakin games were broken. What can I say, they still got my $10 or 12 dollars of gameplay. I played the Jurrasic Park and was looking forward to it but the gun would just not fire.  I hardly played anything else. Got like one free game of the Horses Sega DOC.  Next time I can just use up this card real quick I guess. You know what though I would really like to try Gameworks in another location though, For real."}
{"text":"I don't know if you've already heard or not, but I'm pretty good at Dance Dance Revolution.  It just seems like I was born a natural.    Okay I lied.  I am absolutely horrible at it, and Gameworks proves it.  I still don't get how the hell you're supposed to know what the person on the screen is going to do.  I did have a few cocktails before attempting to dance dance, but still.  I sucked. Big time.  Anyways, this is a great place to bring the kids, and the not so kids.  There are sooo many different games to play, and they have the crazy ones that are more like rides than games.  A couple of hours of games isn't going to be cheap though, but it's pretty fun if you're into arcades."}
{"text":"Walked in the door and greeted with a sour face.   Clearly someone who didn't want to be working.    Not the cheery kids place welcome I was expecting.   Then when I asked for the extra plan she said she already rung me up and couldn't help me.    I asked for the manager who was very pleasant and professional and fixed the issue within seconds.     If someone doesn't want to work at a people oriented business, choose a different path but don't make your customers feel like you're doing them a favor.     If it wasn't for the manager I would give this experience a one star."}
{"text":"I hate to leave bad reviews, but it was really awful. 25% of the machines didn't work. From basketball to even pinball. Then our cards didn't work on all the machines and they pretty much told us oh well the card reader isn't working. Until they put some time and money to repair things, don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"My son had a great time here for his birthday last night! The girls up front were friendly and our waitress was great! Nice place for adults and kids! I didn't give it 5 stars because the games were a bit pricey! We ordered pizzas and were impressed at how good they were!"}
{"text":"They get three stars for having great employees and prices. But everything else about this place just doesn't compare to D&B. It's smaller, it's not as clean and half the games are broken. I will say however that the employees are very understanding of the condition of their machines and will do their best to fix everything. That's something that I really appreciate. They occasionally have deals on Groupon/LivingSocial so look out for this if you're planning on coming here."}
{"text":"We had to kill time before watching a movie, so we came here to the bar to eat some food and get some drinks.  The bartender was great, great customer service. The egg roll Mexican appetizer we ordered was really good, but the sauce it came with.. BACK AWAY. it was hard to swallow, to sweet to even try to describe.  As for the main dish we got a chili burger... worst decision ever. It sounded amazing, it was bad. Just bad. The chile was more like a can of beans that was poured over the burger, that was a little more done than medium well, and no extra zing taste, nothing. Not enjoyable at all."}
{"text":"I been here a few times with my girlfriend and we had the pleasure of having Chris the bartender take care of us! He does a good job. Now today we are here again and Andy helped us he was awesome and very professional. I definitely  recommend this place if you want to have some quick food and drinks plus arcade games! What more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"GameWorks is back in town and I am happy. I'm not much of a gamer myself but coming here brings the inner kid out of me. Here is my take on the place.  Location: I love the new location in Town Square compared to the old location on the strip. It is below the AMC movie theatre and across from Yard House. It is close to a bunch of good bars and restaurants. Here are a few: Yard House, Capriotti's, Mcfaddens, Sugar Factory.   Interior: When you walk in the front doors there is a service station to your left and a seating area, there is also seating on the exterior if you prefer that. The bar is 20ft from the front door. The bar was average in size with a good selection of alcohol, we ordered a jack with coke and Malibu mix drink, both were $6 so that's not bad. Then you have a decent selection of arcade games and various other gaming machines, there was a variation of air hockey which would throw out about 20 mini discs at once, now that was fun and intense. There was a glow in the dark pool table area and bowling lanes which I did not try but will next time.  Staff: The bar staff was good. There was a hipster looking white male who made us feel at home, explained the changes to the new menu, and helped us when needed. There was a short hispanic male who was in the bar area and didn't seem to do much, I'm not sure if he was the manager but he was rude to the staff and extremely bossy. The staff at the ticket counter were good and helped us get the correct amount of points on our card after a machine error.  We will be back soon to try the glow in the dark things and as the drinks are $2 cheaper than Mcfaddens which is upstairs."}
{"text":"Sad attempt to bring back a once cool place..  Boo- the games are so over priced and it's the same games $108.00 rip off. We need a Dave and Busters..."}
{"text":"Overall, the gameworks is pretty weak. i went there on Thursday because you can get endless play after 5. Half of the games are out of order or in some kind of disrepair. They only had one Mario kart racing working and the steering was off! There is no tickets on that night which is fine but then half of the games are dumb because the only point of them is getting tickets.  The food and drink is over priced for what you get. The cards suck and you have to swipe them a bunch of times to get them to work. WEAK!"}
{"text":"It's a nice addition to Town Square but VERY pricey.  Not enough actual arcade games. And some are already broken or not working yet. Bar and restaurant area is too big, takes up half of the place. Bowling is $5 per game and $4 for shoes. Needs a lot of work to get out all the kinks to make this a great local spot."}
{"text":"This place is all about having a lot of video games that are so gouging per-play that you need the flat-pay pass to not be rooked.  But there's plenty of them, so if you're crawling across the strip and need to slow your drinking roll \"lest you chunder heartily\" as an intoxicated friend once said, this is a good stop to recouperate.  Pass on eating here, big mehs.  There's a few pool tables on the upper level, if you need some non-digital gaming.  So for $20 an hour you can share around a pass to bew bew with your friends some aliens, or play Tekken, or whatever you feel like.  It's a bit high priced, but at least most of the games seemed to work.  Giant Protip:  Don't get into the motion simulator when you're drunk.   Don't end up being... that guy, proving drinking and digitally driving should be illegal."}
{"text":"We came in with a friend and her son. Of course, not having any kids of our own, we left them to their own fun and we set off on our own.   The place was busy, but not packed. My partner found his favorite game (some shooter game where you sit in a booth, and you're a pirate fighting undead pirates), and we initially started having a blast. Next, we found an old school Capcom Vs Marvel game that took our credits, and didn't let us play. My partner went to the check in desk and they refunded the credits. Cool. Then we went to a few other games, and most of those would do the same. I started paying attention and saw that it was happening to others, too.   After getting frustrated, we found our friend and her son and played a bit with him (some of those kid games are even more fun than the arcade games). The ticket redemption area was a madhouse, as to be expected, but the staff was friendly enough. The trainer could have been more helpful with his trainee, but he was preoccupied with chatting with his coworkers, who found it appropriate to flip one another off in front of small children (but at least the coworker had enough tact to discreetly disguise it as pushing up his glasses).   Oh, and beers are $8 and up (I thought Town Square was a local's place, not the actual Strip), and the girl at the ticket counter said he average cost of a play was 4-9 credits. Sure. In the kid's area. The rest was at least 10 credits a play. One play. No multiple lives, or more than one shot in the kid's area."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Gameworks before and this spot is lagging in the fun aspect. They don't have a huge selections on games and looks like they just scrambled to put the most discounted arcade games in one room and called it a day. Most of the games were also out of order. I feel like the prices are reasonable in locations that have more to offer but this place didn't offer much. I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to kill a couple hours for a reasonable price.  The bowling alley was alot of fun and had a really cool vibe with the blacklights and music. The bar in the bowling alley should be open to make it a little more convenient to order food and drinks. And the A/C needs some work, lol. Besides that , a good time !"}
{"text":"I came here to blow through a pre-loaded one hour play pass on a Tuesday night with my husband. Surprisingly, the place was actually crowded. Our first order of business was to get a drink at the bar, and the drinks ain't cheap. All draft beers, regardless of type or brand, were $6.50. We ordered 2 Stella Artois and were served quick enough, but were thereafter virtually ignored by the staff.  Onward to the arcade! We were disappointed when we realized we would NOT be earning any tickets for the night (because half the fun of going to arcades is collecting tickets to redeem random shit you'll never use). Anyhow, we had fun playing the games we would have never played if we were using a ticket generating game card. The arcade is smaller than I'd like- with most of the games, you had to race some 14 year old runt to play anything.   I would really give Gameworks a 3.5 rating. They lose points for having expensive ass draft beers, poor service at the bar, and a limited section of games. All in all though, I would still return if I'm ever in the mood for it. I'll just get my drinks elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. Gameworks will always have a special place in my heart since I grew up near one (Puente Hills) which my mom unceremoniously dumped me at every Saturday until I was 14. Sadly (or perhaps thankfully since my mother has then decide to parent me), my childhood Gameworks closed BUT, fear not, Vegas Gameworks makes up for it and more.  First of all, I don't like gambling. Actually I don't really dislike it, I just don't care for it. So I don't gamble and I spend most my time at Vegas eating buffets and poking around the hotel room as my companion hits the tables. But one thing the boy and I can agree with are.... CRANE ARCADE GAMES. You know, those things that grab prizes for a buck. Amazing.  The last time boyfriend and I were at Vegas, we came here three times and spent upwards to $160, mostly on crane games. They have an amazing Hello Kitty one and a grand assortment of Japanese style prizes that do not suck. Full-sized Mickey dolls, Pokemon, Care Bears, the works. The people who work here are soo nice, I cannot stress that enough. Jennifer and Jeremy really went out of their ways to help us with whatever we needed and were amazingly personable and gracious. I wished all stores has customer service like that.   We left with a sack full of prizes and (cheesily enough) really great memories of just pounding against a glass partition, yelling DROPPPPPP THE PRIZE. I know it's just an arcade, but amongst the stresses of daily life, it's nice to escape to an arcade and relive some of that childhood glee. You can't buy that kind of innocence and joy.  This place is kind of empty, which I don't know if it's because of the Vegas economy or just the declining nature of arcades. But you know what, leave the Blackjack tables and drop a couple coins into a machine here. It's definitely more satisfying than two Jacks. Promise."}
{"text":"I remember having so much fun when Gameworks was on The Strip back in the 90's but they closed their doors for reasons I can't remember. But they oepened at Town Square a few decades later...now, I feel ancient.  The initial scent of sweaty gym socks and piss as soon as you walk in only lasts about 5 minutes then, you get used to the smell. To the left, is an area where you can pick out your prize and to the right is a virtual gaming room for those who love PC games. Straight ahead are arcade games, circus games, simulators, Air Hockey, photo booth, etc. To the right and towards the back are private rooms for events and parties. At the very back is the bar/restaurant.  I've been here for a work function and so, we were in a private room. I was pleasantly surprised by the food they served us: chicken marsala, salads, braised beef with veggies, and funnel cakes. They also had more items on the menu. I was expecting pizza, fries, nachos, hotdogs and other junk. We had 2-hour game cards - those don't work on games that could instantly win you a prize (like those machines with claws that grab a toy) and the photobooth. Your time starts dwindling down as soon as you use it.  I felt the need to re-live my youth and play games that I loved as a kid: Street Fighter (hadouken! Tiger uppercut! Sonic boom! Face bite! Helicopter kick!), Air Hockey, DDR and of course, Super Shot - that basketball shooting game. I would spend hours playing Super Shot...that has not changed the few times I've been to Gameworks. I get so into it like you don't even know. Sweat, focus, hand-eye coordination and a little tippy toe so i could see where the ball is going. I got hit on the head with a loose basketball by the kid 2 spaces away from me and I'm still going. I'd wake up the next day with my shoulders and calves feeling sore - but oh my gosh, it's so fun! I got people watching me when I play - I'm either such a badass at playing or there isn't a free hoop to shoot.  I tried all of the other games when I got tired. I got challenged to play Air Hockey by my sister and a few other people - I owned every single one of them.  But what I'd like to know is: what is that green phallic thing they have for prizes?"}
{"text":"I really only come here to watch UFC and some football games. Nice crowd for the UFC fights no cover charge and they usually have happy hour specials during the fights and football games."}
{"text":"Decided to check Gameworks on their opening day. They were giving out 2 free hour game cards with a purchase of a $12 card (54 credits) because they were experience problems, which is a nice gesture. By problems that meant that half of the games weren't working. I went to the MGM location when it was open and honestly this location doesn't even come close. There are very little games and it doesn't help that most of them were down and the area is really small. Staff is very nice though. Their systems went completely down around 9:30pm and that's when my boyfriend and I decided to leave.   What this Gameworks has that the old one didn't is an Esports area where you can play PC games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft. I get the concept of this idea, but you can stay home and play these games and this space could've been utilized for more games.   I'll give this place another chance when they've had time to straighten out their kinks."}
{"text":"Went for the gaming experience and it was okay. It's a lot smaller than the location on the strip. I do like how they've incorporated a card to swipe your credits now instead of actual tokens. But, it could use some improvements."}
{"text":"This time I was fully won over. They put some new games I didnt see on my first visit. Brought my boyfriend here with his sister's family. The kids had a blast playing all the different games. Still hoping to see some old school games get put in. Like the fact that if you get hungry you can eat in there too and not have to actually leave. Wish the tickets and prizes were a little more better and easier to get but other than that no complaints. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, this was the place to go for a few drinks and enjoy some video games with your friends. Now there is a swanky club with personal gaming and this place is more of a distant memory. Yes, the days of marketing Vegas as a family friendly destination are long gone, but Gameworks is still around.  The selection is becoming more of a history museum of classic arcade games with a few modern additions. A few of my friends and I got a couple of two hour play cards and went around to a majority of the machines. The only ones off limit were the prize and ticket games. We played a few shooters, fighting, and racing games from when we were in high school for pure nostalgic enjoyment. Then there are the DDR and Pump dance games. I am not a fan of dancing games, but once I saw the new Pump game had K-Pop, took off with the swipe card. There are old classic songs from Sechkies and DJ Doc mixed in with Big Bang, 4minute, Orange Caramel, Beast, and SHINee. To most, this means nothing, but I did not care if I looked like an idiot. This was entertaining enough to distract me for 20 minutes.   As an adult, two hours here is a stretch. Even with my enthralled love of K-Pop, it barely covered the time. It was nice to just act like a kid again, but a full day pass would be too much."}
{"text":"GameWorks is still the same GameWorks that was on the Strip. The prices are high, the games race car and shooter centric. The kids had a blast running around and playing the games. The Pac-Man air hockey was definitely the crowd favorite though. A mix between hungry hungry hippos and air hockey made for a hectic scavenging mess. It might lead to someone getting a face full of pucks, but it is always worth it to crush your rivals. The fighter jet game in a pod was also quite fun. Otherwise, I tend to go back to the tennis game.   Besides the central room; there is a bowling alley, gamer room with computers and gaming systems. I didn't eat, but their drinks are really reasonable. To get a Hendricks and soda or a Bulleit and ginger beer was $16. Maybe I am so used to paying Strip prices, but it just doesn't sound too bad."}
{"text":"The location is better, away from the strip. It is a lot smaller from the old Gameworks. The games are great and up to date. Durning the weekend there is a ton of families. But it's a giant arcade so I can't complain. Overall it's okay place and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"It's like Vegas here.  Full of flashing lights and noises, but no real content or anything to make you stick around too long, but it looks so fun from a distance."}
{"text":"Loads a fun and you can spend lots of cash.  We took kids 10 and 7 year olds and they had a blast.  4 hours $115.00"}
{"text":"For arcades, Gameworks pretty much owns. Located in Arizona Mills, it offers plenty of entertainment & food nearby. I enjoyed the overall experience here -- it's been several years since I last visited a GW. They've got classics, new games and a pretty chill atmosphere. Though, they kind of lack enough games that spit out tons of tickets, like D&B's. Will be coming back again! :-)"}
{"text":"Paid for use of a computer in the gamer lounge. Spent my 1 hour fighting with the computer. None of the games would launch and nothing worked. Staff was friendly thus the one star. Venue is completely understaffed with one guy running around doing everything. Moved to Xbox console and asked for free extra hour, which they gave me.  Then was told only one copy of popular games.   Its only $5/hour but gowd what a hassel."}
{"text":"Horrible service...Disgusting food...prices are crazy for the small portion they serve you."}
{"text":"Through the Pogo pass, we were only allowed to play the blue light arcade games,  which is totally fine,  didn't have a problem with that, except half of the arcade games were broken! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Facility is similar to a Dave and Busters but with a larger arcade area and a bar instead of restaurant.  Games: Okay selection. Typical games like carnival style, ticket winning games, arcade racing, two rhythm and very few Japanese games. My personal favorite is Taiko Drum Master. Some o the games are rather old and as maintain as other places.  People: For families and children. The kids could be worst and parents have them in line as best they can. Something about the place and the energy causes the parents to be very impatient and irrational.  Probably some kids are pestering their parents and they are at their wits end. The parents are only interested with their kids and they will interrupt your game if their kids want to play. Teenagers are just as bad. \"Every man from himself\" is what this place is like. That happen twice in one visit.  (Specific example, we waited in like for about 1/2-1hr for a game. Then a parent interrupted us when we were playing the game in the beginning and we were like fine. After a while we left and came back. Then we played again after waiting in line for [1/2-1hr] not interrupting the previous player but someone ask us to leave again.)  Arcade is for family which is great but the parents aren't gamers and have zero gaming etiquette.  Staff: Attentive and do what they must. About what you expect.  Come here if you have children. Maybe if you want to go from machine to machine. Not if you want to progress in the game or beat it."}
{"text":"We spent a whole day at the arcade during our stay in Vegas! The games were all in working order, and there were plenty games to choose from. Listened to the advice of others and did not eat at the arcade.  There was a great selection of games, but when they got busy, many were being played and there was much more down time.  Totally worth the price with the Groupon!"}
{"text":"Oh Gameworks. When will I learn to stop holding you to such high, reasonable, expectations...  My first awful experience with this place was back in January of 2015. We went for my little brother's birthday, and he was super excited to win a prize from the arcade. When we told our waiter this, he offered us the all you can play for 2 hours pass, and we thought: \"perfect, we can earn a bunch of tickets and get him something fun!\" It wasn't until the two hours ended and we tried to redeem our tickets that we were informed we did not win any tickets, the pass just gave us unlimited game play. My brother was heartbroken, and we walked out empty handed, and when we complained to the front desk they refused to do anything for us, and told us we should have specifically asked the waiter. What?! I wrote this same review on their facebook page, and management never responded. I have sworn off going here since then, but last night I decided to give it another shot since my fiance wanted to play some games for his birthday.   I would give this experience two stars as well. A lot of games were not working, and the games that did work were EXPENSIVE. I get that it's in a tourist-y area, but really? 9 credits for one game where you don't get a substantial amount of tickets? It's not like the prizes you offer are anymore reasonably priced, and the cheap prizes are dollar store things.   Also, management decided it would be advantageous to dust their ceiling off as my fiance and I were standing right next to them. We were playing a game when dust just came pouring down on us - seriously?! You couldn't warn us first? Afterwards, when we walked away, the manager made eye contact with us, saw us covered in dust, and didn't say anything. I was appalled.   I have tried to like this place, but I just can't. I know D&B has had some issues in it's first few weeks, but I would rather spend my time there then spend anymore time at Gameworks - they've been open for at least two years and they still can't get it together."}
{"text":"Very inconvenient for parents, since there's no lounge or sitting area to chill while kids are playing. The plaza outside is very cute and nice. The arcade definitely has a lot of games for kids, and I would certainly recommend it, if there was a place I could sit and wait for my kid."}
{"text":"We had my daughters 4th birthday here. We weren't able to purchase a pitcher bc we weren't having a party but they were very polite. I didn't like that it was very busy and very loud."}
{"text":"I am not one to write bad reviews about companies, but wow. Went on Saturday night and easily 1/2 the games we played or wanted to play had broken \"something.\" Terminator was up and running but had one gun that didn't work, and one that was entirely missing. Many games were not fully assembled, and out of order signs where everywhere. Also very small number of games overall compared to last spot. Very disappointed, and I don't think we will return."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The first time there was a house of the dead 4 special that was super amazing to play. When I returned a few years later the machine was no longer there which made me sad since you can't really find it anywhere else anymore.  Even so I had a good time here. I had no issues with broken machines and after burner climax was a dream to play (Actually beat that game here FINALLY)  The staff was very friendly and helpful when I couldn't get my old credits off my card."}
{"text":"It's a little smaller than the Gameworks that was on the strip.   The food seating area is big and pretty unnecessary. Could add more games as there looks like there's space for them.   I like how there's a PC/gaming area which is nice. Also there's a bowling alley as well.   Me and my friends played some games n stuff. Although there wasn't a lot of games as there was before, we still had fun.  hopefully they add more games or interactive games in the near future like they had in the past."}
{"text":"I went here ten years ago for a martial arts tourney and was like hellz yes! I went back at the age of 26 and said \"WTF!\" I could get more out of going to Dave and Busters back  home...."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple friends to play and drink. Our bartender Arthur was extremely helpful and attentive to us and the other guests. I would come back to GameWorks just for his great service alone."}
{"text":"$15 for unlimited games for 1 hour isn't a bad deal.  When half of the games are broken, it's a bad deal.  When you see only 1 technician walking around to fix one at a time, it's very frustrating.  I guess next time I should do a walk around to see if it's worth while."}
{"text":"Gameworks is always a lot of fun.  I'd give it five stars but I think they've gotten pretty expensive - pretty much $1 minimum per game.  Some games are $2.50 or so.  The cost goes down per game if you buy a big fat ticket with bonus credits.  I dropped $30 on me n the 12-yr-old boy and we played for a couple hours - mostly shooting hoops.    Another thing - I miss my old games.  They used to have a bunch of old \"quarter\" games upstairs - classics like Joust, Galaga, Tempest and Burger Time.  Now there are many versions of fighting games."}
{"text":"So let's start off by saying that this new location at town square in my opinion sucks!  I liked that it was on the strip before because it was more for adults. The reason I gave it two stars because we got a good deal of one large pizza (though the food sucks) and 4 one hour game cards for $40, not bad. Otherwise the place is small , food sucks, and effin kids all over the place who cut you in line because you are an adult and there for don't play games ? (Sarcasm) So its another chuckee cheese but with a different name. If you don't get the $40,deal then its $20,for  100,credits how long is that? Idk it doesn't say ."}
{"text":"Love the games here , you can really get a bang for your buck and there's always good promos here . Food and drink prices are also good and there's a happy hour ."}
{"text":"1lady there that works at the bar needs a attitude adjustment also she do not know how to make the drinks proper and very mean rude should be fired"}
{"text":"Brought my family here for dinner and some games. Food was low quality and 1/2 of the games were inoperable. Never going to waste my hard earned money here again. And by the way don't give them your email they will never stop sending you offers."}
{"text":"Recently discovered that my 11YO enjoys playing pool, briefly considered getting him a fake ID so we can hit up PTs. Or tossing all furniture out of the living room and getting a pool table. Still working on the first option for Mr Papagiorgio, in the mean time we made Gameworks our go to spot for playing pool.    Pros- kid can play glow in semi dark pool while you enjoy a Sam Adams. Only one of my kids likes pool, so our routine is to get a pool table, take advantage of the 14.99 for an entree and one hour game card special and send the more down to earth sibling out into arcade area, while we show off our non existent pool skills.    Everyone's happy and filled up on pizza, fish and chips, or whatever other choice kids make. Bowling alley, where pool tables are, is usually empty and mysterious, if you are looking for ambiance. Smells like feet, as God intended.  There are also daily specials and happy hours and such for the value minded. Also, pool counts as PE, right? I homeschool, so PE credit is important.    Cons- pool games are far from cheap. $9/hour is making me seriously consider ditching the family poker table and investing into a nice \"I'm over my man cave\" Craig's list second hand-me-down.   Another con is coordinating everything. We play at odd hours, so staff is light. Between hitting up one spot for pool balls, ordering food from another, juggling ID held for pool balls and ID required before Mr Sam Adams is brought out, it takes some logistical talent before everything falls into place. I learned to settle the bill upon ordering so that the ants in the pants sibling can get her hands on the game card early in the experience.   I just go with assumption everything will go smoothly from there and throw caution to the wind.    If you want to know about the food- it's frozen and fried, ok? Just like kids like it. Don't come here looking for culinary experience, shuffle over to Brio, you grown up, you.    In short, it's where you can take the kids when they've outgrown Chuk e Cheese, and I am OK with that."}
{"text":"Gameworks has gotten a LOT better lately.  They reorganized their game floor, got rid of a bunch of crap and added a bunch of Japanese arcade machines straight from Tokyo, with English instructions typed out on paper and taped to the machines!  They have an entire little area dedicated to fighting games with the nice sit-down, 1 person-per-machine, but still 2-player linked setups.  Fighting fans will know what I'm talking about.  They also hold tournaments semi-regularly, the last time I was there they were running a KOF tournament which was $5 to enter.  I don't know about prices because I never look or care.  I go and drop $27 to fill up my card with a grip of credits and can go back for days.  I enjoy this place much more than D&B, especially since it seems D&B's games are stagnant.  Gameworks is always mixin' it up."}
{"text":"Went in looking to grab some food and play some games while I waited for my movie at Regal to start. Got a quesadilla at the bar which us very confusing just to sit down. There's a huge barrier around the whole dining bar area which is very annoying but for safety I guess. Food was tiny portion but delicious, no complaints with the food.  My biggest issue with this place is the games. It's called game works. So how come half of the games are broken or missing crucial elements like the crucial foam pad for the shotgun. I had three machines just take my money and do absolutely nothing. After talking with staff they said oh ya it doesn't work now..... So y not put a \"this is broken\" sign on there???!!!    My plans for a relaxing playtime turned into utter frustration. I won't be back unless I hear they do a mega renovation."}
{"text":"SCAM ALERT!  I should probably give this place more than 1 star b/c there are things that I like.  But I have a difficult time when places are blatantly being cheap and cheating children and families.    Specifically, I'm referring to their Wizard of Oz machine which is one of those coin dozer type games where you knock coins down.  This game was fun to us at first b/c it has cards that you can collect and if you manage to gather them all, you can turn them in for a ticket bonus of like 2000 tickets.  So I learn that the Toto dog card is the rarest of the bunch and there are only a few in each machine.  And obviously you need this card to complete the set and the ticket bonus.  Well obviously they are aware of this too b/c they literally have all of the Toto cards out of play.  How do I know this?  Because they are stupid enough to put them in the machines at the very top of the decks so that you can see that they are in there.  But the cards fall from the bottom and somehow the Toto card is always on top.  Not 1. Not 2. But 3 in plain view and out of play.  I have been in and out of there for over 6 months and just check as I walk by and they are still right there on top.    I would never accuse a place of being shady or trying to scam people without being sure... but I think 6 months straight is a fair amount of time to base my accusations.  I have pictures as proof on my other phone.  Who knows what other games they have rigged that aren't so obvious.  It's sad really that a business would be so cheap when it comes to winning a relatively small amount of tickets used to buy mostly junk toys.  Shame on Gameworks for taking a game that is expensive to play anyways and feeling the need to cheat children and families.    I'm taking my business to other places.  John's Incredible Pizza is a very good alternative for those that don't like to support shady businesses."}
{"text":"We decided to hsve our football banquet here and it was great. The planning was simple, and there event coordinator Samantha went above all expectations to accommodate my team and our guest, including a last minute change of date. We arrived to game works early to set up and everything was already set up and ready for us. Our party host Brittney was attentive to my guest, because a bunch of boys will undoubtedly spill a drink or two, and the food and drinks never ran dry. One of the biggest compliments from our parents was in regards to the food, they were all impressed on how good the food tasted, the Italian spread was delicious. I will definitely be back. Thanks again game works"}
{"text":"My kids love this place, used Groupon deal for all day gaming with no issues what so ever."}
{"text":"An adult chuckie cheese in my eyes, there is always a special deal during the week. Lots of prizes and games. Great place to go and have fun and hang out."}
{"text":"First time ever comin to this place. First of all, all the staff is mixed up we came here on Thursday unlimitied bowling supposedly... The guy in the suit n red tie who supposedly is the Manager tells us they keep changing rules like dude if your the manager your supposed to be up to date on the policys and the rules and tell customer whats going on. The .manager told us we can bowl until 1am but didnt mean to mention that we have to switch lanes and switch pur spots. We were posted at the end of the bowling lanes at lane 8 and I've been tipping the servers a lot they know me and you want to ruin it by saying there's a line of people. If im paying my money because I thought I would have this spot for the night and you tell me we have to stop and move to smother lane thats not right. Ive been HERE more than 3 hours waiting for the sppt and place to enjoy my time with my family."}
{"text":"This place looked like it would be amazing, and there was definitely fun to be had. However, so many of the games weren't working right that it took the fun out of the day. If I were a little kid and I had saved up just to play a game where you can't aim the gun right, or get your tickets, or strum the guitar, it would be heartbreaking!  I was standing in a section full of games either turned off or broken, on a Saturday in the summer in Arizona, when I realized that this place is likely literally dying. Half full, no one really happy, faces full of disappointment, and they are grasping at straws with the groupons and free offers (and they didn't make me want to come back, so it was all for naught).  In a past life, I would talk to small businesses about their reviews, and they would always be insistent that the bad reviews weren't their fault and weren't real. Well, in this case a quarter of your games were off, another quarter were not working properly (yet taking money), and that isn't anyone else's fault but management."}
{"text":"Game Works should lower their pricing and give more credits when kids/adults are playing at this establishment. They give stingy credits when playing and you spend most of your money on it and get nothing in return. You are ripping off customers!!!"}
{"text":"What: indoor arcade. It's smaller than I thought it would be.   Price: 200 credits for $35 to share between 2 kids lasted almost 1 hour. It would have been longer but they went on the Dark RideXD 3 times which was $5 per ride but they enjoyed this the most. They did Gigamon, the Pirate one and the Werewolf one. The gal was nice enough to throw in a free ride since it was a slow day. It was neat because there was a monitor so I could watch what they were doing inside (it's like a little theater). She also let me watch some of the game on her monitor so I could see what they see (minus the 3D). I thought the Werewolf one was really cool.   Location: Inside Town Center, lots of parking.   Great indoor fun for a rainy or too hot day!"}
{"text":"Have to say, my son didn't have the greatest birthday party here, HOWEVER, after contacting the company they ensured everything was made right. After seeing what they will do for their customers, I will be a Gameworker for life!"}
{"text":"Good sized portions and the price wasn't too bad for being on the strip. Had the caesar chipotle chicken salad. Pretty good sized. Daughter had ribs and they fell right off the bones. Son had BBQ burger, pretty big size. Wife had margarita pizza, she loved it"}
{"text":"I became a yelp member just to write this review! I went to the restaurant with my husband and 4 kids Saturday to take a break from the arcade. Ordered food for everyone. Unfortunately there was nothing on the menu I could eat so I picked up a salad from a near by place to eat with my family. At first we were told next time we cannot bring in outside food. I apologized and continued to sit while my husband took the kids back to the arcade. There were 2 other families there (one with outside food, a birthday cake) sitting, talking clearly done with their food. The server then came back up to me and my newborn and told me we would have to leave because they needed our table for another group. Mind you, the place was empty with tables everywhere and no one waiting to be seated. She said because I already paid I could no longer sit there. I ordered a coffee so I could sit but was deeply disturbed. I have been a Las Vegas resident my whole life and have never been asked to leave a restaurant after paying for food. NEVER GO THERE! They may ask you to leave after you give them your money for mediocre food."}
{"text":"A fairly large arcade with a good variety of newer games.  The only negative was a stale sewerage smell while we were in there.    I was surprised to see a lot of UFO Catcher (claw) machines - I almost felt like I was in a Japanese arcade.  They also had DDR Extreme, DDR Supernova, and Pump It Up machines in good working order.  We didn't spend too much time here, just long enough to play a few rounds of DDR and scope out the place.  We didn't expect to see such a well-rounded arcade in Vegas.  I can't vouch for the food, but it's worth a stop if you're looking for some video game entertainment, or a break from the casinos."}
{"text":"Place is fun for the kids.. but bought an unlimited game card but a LOT of the games were broken, in need of servicing or unavailable.  it's like saying all you can eat but not put out any food..  sheesh"}
{"text":"The Town Square shopping center is a pretty interesting place because the mix of shops & activities is good for locals & tourists.  The wait at Brio on Mother's Day was 90 minutes, so GameWorks provided a much-needed distraction for Baby C.  Hat tip to Phil T for mentioning this place.  Otherwise, I would have never known about it.  I noticed a few games were straight-up imports from Japan, and other games that I had never seen anywhere else, such as Kung-Fu Panda (so much fun), Transformers and Mario Kart.  There's the usual skee-ball, and some air hockey games as well.  I paid an absurd amount of $ for Baby C to get candy and some water gun made in Taiwan, but that's not the point.  The point is 90 minutes went by pretty quickly, and Baby C was totally entertained.  Not entirely happy about paying a deposit for a card, since I gave it back to GameWorks at the end of the day.  But it's Vegas, so you're not even thinking about it."}
{"text":"If you like to pay for old & heavily used arcade games, then this is your place. The ticket and card buying system is a little bit complicated. I just wouldn't spend money here again. Some game were fun but not worth it."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Ordered drinks, Waitress \"lost\" the paper she wrote our drinks down on.. so she came back   15 minutes later to re-take our drink order. Then she brings my dr. Pepper in a little kids cup!  We ordered two pizzas, one pepperoni and one cheese.   Still no plates & silverware.. My friend went behind one of the service stations and got us plates & silverware after our pizza had already gotten cold.  Pizza was so-so , definitely undercooked and super greasy. Waited thirty minutes for a refill on drinks until we finally pulled a different server to refill them for us.  Waited another 15-20 minutes for the check. After that was done, we waited for the game card while watching the waitress go to every single one of her other tables to chat and talk with her friends before we got our game card. . .       We won't be back. Honestly, we might as well go to Chuckee-Cheese. It's cheaper & the pizza sucks there too... But atleast we get service there!!"}
{"text":"When Gameworks first opened I was really disappointed but I have been going more recently and enjoy everything it has become. The food is good and there is a good happy hour during the week. I would like to give a shoutout to Michael for helping me with a problem with my card and recommending some food for my dinner. He helped during a stressful misplacement of my game card which had all my tickets."}
{"text":"Save your money and place it all on double 0s on the roulette tables.  Okay, double 0s doesn't exist on the rating bar but that's what i feel this place deserves. The other raters say it all: poor selection of games, machines down for maintenance - in fact some machines looked like they were working but it just eats up your credit, and inattentive staff.  I should have taken my clue from the one guy who was attempting to scalp his all day pass ($35).  Now that I know what I know, I wouldn't waste a single dollar on it."}
{"text":"While this is a more convenient location than the original Game Works it does somewhat lack the content and size of the strip location. I can't help but compare any venue of the type to Dave & Busters of which there is no comparison. We came for Birthday party, they did do a good job and our server Mike was outstanding. But $11 for six slices of pizza is a bit much as we had to buy over six pizzas to feed 10 hungry teens. Buy the size of the crowd its nice to see Game Works doing well but they could reduce the dinning area to accommodate more gaming space as it was only half full at best on a Saturday night. Overall we had good time."}
{"text":"so, not a real fan of gaming joints, but this place was aiight. the good first: i had a bacon burger and fries while watching the SC football game in a \"private room\" and it was AWESOME. the burger and fries, seriously, so juicy and delicious. i was totally prepared to be pissed because those places are usually really gross, but this ish was awesome. but now the bad: I never got a refill on my expensive coke, the bathrooms STUNK tremendously so badly that you could smell it even before entering the hallway, and they only have double disc air hockey which is far too complex and made me long for simpler days. still, i gave three generous stars thanks to the burger and fries. good food goes a long way in my book."}
{"text":"We purchased the $15.99 one entree one hour game card combo. The pizza was good, the kids loved it. The one hour game card does not include collecting tickets for prizes. You can play those games, however the kids do not get tickets. What a rip off. The kids were pissed and do not want to go back.  It was not explained to us by the waitress nor do any of the signs mention this little caveat."}
{"text":"Wow! A waste if space! Most of atleast 20% of the games were out of order! Did you it did you not just open? It was way WAY over priced! They are sneaky about the way they do it too! Most games cost more then a dollar a piece! The place is set up horrible! Destiny is it will fail! Your no longer on the strip your in a local mall!  20 bucks 100 points a game takes 9 points 11 games 20 bucks! And we're talking a stupid ticket game that's over in 20 seconds! Same crap at chuck e cheese 20 cents....... No kidding!"}
{"text":"I'm not a video game person.  Just don't play them.  I'm not anti-video game, but I'd rather read a book.  Yes, my geek card membership is nowhere near expiring.  But anyhow...  I still like this place.  See - it was all building up to something.  2 levels of video games - including one that you have to strap yourself into because you physically go up and drop down 4 different levels with your feet hanging.  I even like playing that one!  And one room full of those jet ski/skate boarding/skiing kind of games where you have to move your body to play the game.  And of course, the requisite Dance Dance Revolution.  I'll never play that one EVER - but it's a blast to watch folks play.  The more serious they are the more hilarious it is to me.  I'm telling you - it's free entertainment!  Upstairs is cool.  The restaurant and bar are kinda TGIF/Applebees-esque so while not specifically bad, not amazingly good either.  We rented out a VIP room for a birthday years and years ago and it was an awesome time. Lots of catering options from the restaurant, but the hit of the night was their coffee bar.  All you can drink during the time the room is rented.  I hope they are still doing that one.    And girls, if you aren't into games but you're significant other is - do like me.  This Valentine's day instead of some crappy box of chocolates or flowers that would only die - I gave a Gameworks gift certificate. Oh yea.  Big points."}
{"text":"The place itself was cool but the customer service was terrible. Our server was friendly but nowhere around when we needed her.  The bartender also had a bad attitude, I questioned a double crown neat because it looked like an ounce and a half.. which is the standard for a shot. She grabbed the glass and went over to her jigger and measured it out but spilled some on the process. The second shot wasn't full but she shot me a look like \"See?!\" so I wasn't gunna piss her off more by telling her I saw it wasn't full I saw her spill some in the process. I did ask if the jigger was only an ounce and she said yes. Super low house pour.. and the fact that the second wasn't full basically meant I paid $15 for a standard shot.  The other drink I ordered was flat.. I was flustered by her attitude and didn't ask her to remake it.   Not a good experience with the employees but we had fun playing games."}
{"text":"When compared to Dave and Busters, this place doesnt look like much, but it does its job. Since moving to vegas about 2 weeks ago, i've tried to do anything and everything possible that doesnt involve going to bars/clubs. I had always passed by this place but never went inside until this past saturday. I didnt eat the food, and the outdoor bar was closed, but i assume it would be open during warmer weather.   Gameworks is pretty decent sized. My gf had a yardstick alcohol drink bought from fat tuesdays at planet hollywood (hurricane 51 with 2 viles of tequilas) and we thought it was against the rules to bring it in... however the security guard told us \"well, its a kids place, so we kinda frown upon that.... but i dont care. go ahead\". Well alright then! There were a few games I had never seen before: One was an air hockey game that played with 3 discs and two hitters (one in each hand). game up to 15. the other game was virtual bowling. real lane real ball but no pins. you bowl it right under a screen and it virtually shows you how many/what pins you knocked down. although not 100% on the money, it was close enough. Spent $20 for the night and left with a smile on my face. And I didnt have to take a taxi back to my apartment. Viva Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Used to be a solid 5 stars.  We RV camp and ride ATV's in the nearby desert sand dunes. When the weather turns sour we put the quads away and head for Gameworks, Blue Man group,, and the wildest buffet we could find.  My kids say Game Works has lost touch with what kids want. They are in competition with Playstation and X Box and really need some original thought with inspiration to make a comeback.  The upstairs bar is fun but a bit pricey, so check for drink specials, they can be a great bargain. The food is above average.  Used to be clean and very well run,, now just a tourist trap with no soul nor imagination,, no sense of fun nor humor, and it's falling into dis-repair."}
{"text":"Fun place ...a lot of good games  all working  To the food n beverage department. ..pls have more options on happy hour ...."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time.  Ordered 3 fish dinners with fries. Two with waffle fries and the kid that delivered them to the table had no idea which ones were extra  crispy. No malt vinegar? ?? WTH??? Sever says they are their best sellers. 4 small pieces for $14.00."}
{"text":"The games are nice and the place is clean but the rest is horrible. This is NOT even in the same category as Dave and Busters. I've had bar food that was better. This was gas station quality food. The nachos literally had gas station canned cheese on it. My son had the steak salad. He couldn't even chew the meat. Then we had a birthday coupon that had to be approved by the manager. That took 20 minutes.  Save your money."}
{"text":"It is a play for kids, loud, games are worn down, toys are for kids. The food is not bad. I just wanted everyone to have some fun. My kids like it. Right out side there is this park is nice for them as well."}
{"text":"I was lucky to get an hour event pass from the k9 competition a while back and a 2hr event pass from my best friend, Darrel.  A great place to unwind, unfortunately, a few arcade machines needing repair. There is a small bowling alley and serves alcohol with the normal quick bites.  Parking is a little difficult to find as it is always busy."}
{"text":"Sure, I like video games & especially the nostalgia invoked of playing Pac-Man, etc. in the 80s. My hands don't move that fast now but it's still fun! You have to remember that this is a place for the kiddos so it will be crazy/loud etc. If that gets to be too much, they do have adult beverages. In case you haven't been to an arcade since the 80s, they now have cards onto which they load 30, 60 minutes etc. of play time. So you can leave the quarters at home!   I've been here a few times for various events, and for my birthday last year after they sent me a deal for free gaming for up to 6 people for 30 minutes and a birthday treat from the restaurant for me! That worked out as I had visitors in town who were up for some free video gaming. I'm a skee ball fan and also prefer the racing games (of which they have a few here) and so that was an enjoyable birthday stop!"}
{"text":"Wow- I am not even sure how to write a review on this one.... literally all I can say is that I was very underwhelmed and disappointed!  I was expecting so much more...."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here because my job had their annual Christmas party here. Amazing atmosphere all around and surprisingly enough, not as loud as I expected to be (but then again it was a semi late Sunday night.) The food provided was excellent--we had a range from Pizza, wings, mini pretzels, tortilla chips, jalepeno poppers and mini sliders (which I kept coming back for, haha.) Our hosts were amazing! I forgot their names sadly (I swear one was named Lorenzo?) but the female hostess with the purple hair was extremely sweet and helpful and our male server was funny and cool as well! GW provided us free game cards and a 2 hour play card but this is a place where you get tired out at easily depending on what game you play (or what you're doing overall), so I only did a couple rounds of DDR. Noting from other reviewers, the games mostly seemed to be back in working condition, so I suppose they recently fixed everything? The only disappointment was the E-sports looked lacking (again, the time and day could have contributed to that.) Would I be back? Probably not because it is QUITE a distance from my place of residence but for special occasions, absolutely. Definitely a place to check out if you're needing an arcade fix or just a cool place to hang."}
{"text":"What happened to GameWorks? Before Dave and Busters this was a great spot for arcade games for both kids and adults but now it's just blah. More than half of the machines are dead or appear to work and take your credits but end up not working. I paid for their most expensive card ($52) and I can't even use most of the credits because most of the games are dead. It doesn't even appear as though the company cares about the games. They appear to be copying Adventure Dome because now it has one of those immersive rides. I didn't use it but it didn't look eye catching based on the demo they had. If you want to go for an arcade in town, I suggest going to Dave and Busters  at least the games work and the food isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Great place, But if you are vegan and looking for something to eat, don't waste your time. All fun and games, but no food for you."}
{"text":"I visited Gameworks for the first time on 8/13/11 for a Gaia Online offline event from 3-6PM.  We purchased two 2hr game cards and went off to play.  I wish I had checked the game floor before we purchased the cards because I was pretty disappointed.  Many, many machines were listed as out of service and some of the games that were on didn't function properly.  There wasn't a very good selection of games in my opinion.    Our second card after an hour started to read as \"insufficient funds\".  At this point we were really overheated from the heat inside the building and kind of pissed off so we just left and decided not to come back again.  I've had more fun at smaller arcades."}
{"text":"I have never been to a GameWorks, so I'm not sure what I was expecting.   It is unlike other gaming lounges in that they don't integrate the gaming, food and bar areas very well. They have a defined bar and restaurant area that is pretty much empty every time I've ever passed through and then there is a small gaming floor with a mixture of ticketed gaming machines for kids and other video game machines.   I think if they had spread this area out a bit more there would be more room to move around and enjoy the games. It was overly crowded and there weren't too many games that looked worth the time and money to play. The only ones that did were packed and had long waits.  There are so many improvements that could be made here to make it better."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this a lower score.  I would never return here. We had 2 hours of time. And spent most of it walking around. Because they oversell the amount of people they let in."}
{"text":"$25 bucks can go a long way for this place. Of maybe it's because my kid only plays the low credit games? Either way groupon usually has a good deal $10 for all day play. The only down side is  you don't accrue tickets to get prizes. But this place is a good time for both the young and older crowd and the crowd in between. They have a spot to eat and watch sports on numerous screens, pool table, darts, video games, bowling alley (very small), computer room and a private area for parties. It's a pretty cool setup and would suggest this play for family time or even a date night."}
{"text":"If you need to plan any type of party then GameWorks needs to be your choice.  If you want a bowling party forget the casinos bowling centers get to GameWorks.  Contact Jonathon and he will get you taken care of.   A huge shout out to Don and Adrian who took care of us.  I had another corporate event at GameWorks and of course it was awesome.  Great staff!"}
{"text":"Mostly shoot-em-ups and driving sims in the video game arcade. Too many machines were inoperable or had bad audio and video (i.e., hard-to-see, low-contrast, etc.).  NOT worth $20/hour or $35/day. But you might get lucky with an exiting customer willing to sell you his day pass for $10."}
{"text":"Awesome  place! We came for a buddies birthday party. Great location to shop, watch movies, and family time! Jarred from Mississippi was an awesome server. He made some great recommendations and kept our drinks and stomachs full. Overall a great experience. We'll definitely come back!!"}
