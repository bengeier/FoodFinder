{"text":"Beer sampler flight - take the whole 10.  It is rare (unlike my husband)  that I can go through 10 different beers and go , yeah - I like that..  AND 4 beers that were so good they actually forced my eyeballs to the back of my head.  Weizen - a wheat with banana undertones, Chocolate Stout - a collaboration with a local chocolate artisan, Nut Bowl- served with sugared rim glass, flavored with yumminess and their St. Nick Reserve.  Their Penn Gold and Dark rocked - close eyes - think Octoberfest in Munich.  Even their hoppier pilsners were really well balanced.  Food, service, band, locale - perfect.  The brats were wonderful.  Good chili.  Fresh salad.  Gluten Free menu offerings were clearly indicated.    Is a manager reading?  Offer cider or a Gluten Free Beer alternate as well as a GF dessert choice.   I love you Penn Brewery!"}
{"text":"Went in with the bf for drinks and food. Beer was decent and the food tasted very bland. Shocked because we heard so many great things!"}
{"text":"Went there on the night of New Year's Day for dinner. Our server was very nice, but not the greatest, and the food was pretty good but overpriced. I asked for a water with my beer immediately when we got there, I didn't see that water until I had to ask for it again which at that point was when my meal was just about over. Specifically asked for no onions on my burger, which of course came with onions on it. And, when my burger arrived, I waited about 20 minutes before I started eating it because I wanted ketchup, which was not brought out with my meal and our server didn't even make a cameo to check up with us until well after our entrees arrived. I have no inclination to visit Penn Brewery again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a Brew Pub with character, then you definitely want to come to Penn Brewery (Hofbrauhaus feels corporate and like it is trying way too hard).  Penn Brewery IS OPEN despite rumors that it might have to move. (I was there last weekend).  The beer is tremendous and the food is actually quite nice (I had ribs that were melt in my mouth yummy).  I definitely recommend this for dinner, especially when they have musicians."}
{"text":"Penn Brewery is solid. Love the beer cheese, great selection of brews, and always a spacious table to sit and enjoy some kielbasa and pierogis. If I have friends visit the burgh, it's a top 5 spot to take a them to show off our great city.,"}
{"text":"The food was cold and bland. There were four of us in the party, and no one's food arrived even remotely lukewarm. No one was impressed with the entrees we selected. Our server was quite busy (I think the restaurant was short staffed that particular evening). She did her best but often times we waited long periods for drink refills, our appetizers were forgotten to be rung in, there wasn't any silverware on the table so we had to flag down the hostess just to get something to eat with, and it took awhile to have our credit card processed and returned. We waited over a hour to get our food. The restaurant didn't seem that busy but obviously the kitchen was backed up. I understand things like this happen and we weren't in that much of a hurry but the food wasn't worth the wait. We ordered dessert because according to others, they have great desserts - well, the apple turnover was dry and the cookies were stale. No one was impressed. Might go back just to try the different beer selection, but will definitely eat elsewhere prior."}
{"text":"Took a cab from downtown to catch dinner about 30 mins before their publicized kitchen close time. They closed the kitchen early and said they can't help me. Great. Glad I called ahead of time. Now I'm in the middle of nowhere and starving."}
{"text":"Yes, their Oktoberfest is, by far, one of the best outdoor celebrations in Pittsburgh.  But if it is sadly not September, there is still a reason to cross the river to the North Side. It is called happy hour.   Honestly, things were better before the new drink tax--somehow, a 10 percent tax resulted in nearly a 17 percent price increase. But, regardless, I can't stop going. Every Monday - Thursday, from 5 - 7PM, there are specials.   While the website still says that you can get at 22 oz. Penn Weizen on Wednesdays (\"Weizen Wednesday!\"), the last time we were there, we were charged $3.50.   If you're not looking to spend a lot of money, but still want something to eat, an order of Goulash and a side of bread is enough to feed at least three people. Think of it as a gourmet chips and dip.   Perhaps the best part, however, is the entertainment. Where else can you watch grown men in lederhosen play music and sing while you drink a huge beer?  Until I came here, I thought beer chants were something from the Man Show."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a light lunch after going to the Warhol. Unfortunately the wait staff wasn't too interested in serving us? When they finally arrived they said they were busy but there were a lot of empty tables! Not sure how they would handle a real rush? Had heard goods reviews but will not be returning next time I visit Pittsburgh. We went to Fatheads instead and the food, beer and service were great!"}
{"text":"One of the freindliest breweries I have ever been to! Great bartender that really made sure we were welcome and had--his name was Leland. Beer was fabulous..."}
{"text":"This place is not what it once was. it is a shell of its self, with outsourced beer production, canned food, and bad service. Sorry to be so negative, it has earned it however."}
{"text":"Great beer, food and service.  Very cool historical building. Indoor and outdoor seating. Plenty of different German lagers for everyone. Including seasonals.  Had the brezel (Bavarian pretzel with a homemade beer cheese),sourcrout soup, and a huge schnitzel sandwich.  Brian, our server/ bartender, was very friendly and helpful. Recommending beers to go along with our food, and sharing tastes of beers we weren't familiar with. Thank you Brian.  Will return next chance I get!"}
{"text":"first time food was good beer was cold and good wife is a vegaterian they had food for her prices are fair"}
{"text":"Menu could use a little update, and expanded upon. The beer very good and their oktoberfest celebration is something I highly recommend attending (last 2 weekends of sept)"}
{"text":"They have a nice array of beers, and the historic building just takes you back in time.  It has a great feel especially in the outdoor alley.  I come here every oktoberfest where it gets really crowded and you get your beer in milk jugs. Some people dress up and their is a band and food and of course tons of beer.  Fun time for sure.    I have eaten here a few times, i like the Wieswurst and pretzel, nothing spectacular but the food is up to par.   Their best beer is the Hefeweizen in my opinion"}
{"text":"Beer only!  Hubby says buy the beer and bring it home more enjoyable and affordable.   The food is nothing to rave about.  The service was off. The atmosphere was underwhelming.  The building exterior was very interesting.  It was a fun little maze from the parking garage to the front door."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice. The first time was good enough to warrant a second trip, but it's unlikely I'll make a third. Most recently I went on a Saturday night. The server informed us that only two beers were available on tap and the others were bottled, which considering the restaurant is at the brewery reflects poorly on the way the place is managed.  Incredibly loud music that sounded like top 40 country radio played over the speakers, which isn't the sort of atmosphere I want if I'm going to a German style brew pub. My saurbraten was very tough. The pretzel appetizers were OK but were typical chain style food and overpriced for the quality. The server didn't inquire how anything was and generally seemed annoyed to be there. The beer is available elsewhere and the service, atmosphere, and food were mediocre at best. I see no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Food was good, but really not German.  Had Beef Stroganoff... it was more like beef noodles with good steak on top. No signs of what should be in Stroganoff,  lol. Oh and you can tell that the mushrooms are added after \"gravy\" is made. Atmosphere is nice  and the house dark beer is excellent! Would I go back,  probably. .. is it a top 10, no."}
{"text":"The Penn Brewery is a great place for large groups. They accommodated 65 of us with little notice. The food was quite good and the service was excellent. They were organized and the food still came out quickly. The servers deserve 5 stars for their professionalism. The cooks put a lot of care into each plate that came out.  The potato pancakes rock!"}
{"text":"I have eaten and drank at the penn brewery twice.  The service is subpar.  On our most recent visit, our waiter took our drink and food orders and then simply never returned until the food was served- quite a long time later. Considering that this is a brewery it would have been nice to be able to order a second round of drinks.  We love craft beer and were looking forward to trying several of the offerings.  Better service would have increased our enjoyment of this brewery.  The food was much better than the beer.  I had the filet served over noodles and my husband the sausage platter with German potato salad.  I thought mine was very good and he absolutely loved his.  The prices for the meals were reasonable.  We did not think the beer to be anything special. It was fine but there are many breweries in and around pittsburgh that brew a higher quality beer."}
{"text":"I found the beer to be the best thing on the menu.  I had the Liver with Bacon and Onions.  It was goodn if uninspired. I found their version of German Potato Salad lacking.  It seemed that it was 'made to order' and that can be quite pleasing.  In this case,  I found the potatoes sliced oddly in thin strips and completely underdressed. The dressing had little vinegar and no hint of bacon.  My dining partner's Braised Pork Shank was very tender and properly spiced.  I was told that this was superior to Max's Allegheny and found it to be so only in decor an beer selection."}
{"text":"Got steak delicious steak on thick, creamy Mac and cheese. Everyone at the table wanted my dish. Very good food and amazing table service, highly recommended. It was a good find!!"}
{"text":"VERY IMPRESSED! I bought a groupon earlier this year and we decided to give it a try. The food was awesome and authentic. I also ordered a Penn Dark beer and it quickly became my favorite dark beer. It was a great experience and I intend to go back soon. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"German style brau haus. They really have seemed to nail it.  They have most of the the authentic styles of German beers.  They were missing Kolsch and Alt bier but I was told that these rotate in...so I will just have to come back.  The menu is absolutely traditional and reads to be the real deal.  Be aware that I did NOT eat a meal here, only read the menu.  One thing missing is sweinhaxe but this is not easily done with fresh ingredients as ankles are not as readily available in US as Germany.  I will definitely come back and give an update when I have had the chance to really eat.  For any beer fan or German food aficionado, I think that you will be pleased to stop here."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but going to a brewery and they hand you a menu and tell you they only have 3 beers available?! FAIL! Especially when they are out of their seasonal Oktoberfest beer-and its Oktober...you're a brewery, you know the demand for somehting like this.   Anyway, service was mediocre, we moved to a larger table when some family arrived, I had to ask 4 times to include 2 beer stiens into the bill. The bill arives (finally) no stiens were listed. I asked our waitress AGAIN...it took her forever to come back, I figured she was hand blowing them in the back. I contemplating walking over to the bar and helping myself but I refraiend.   All in all, if I'm ever in town again I most likely wont come here. It was a total let down. *sad face*"}
{"text":"I am visiting Pittsburgh with my dog and called ahead to see if the restaurant was dog friendly, something I always do before heading to a restaurant.   The person who answered the phone said dogs are welcome, but had to sit on the edge of the courtyard and informed me they had a special doggy dining area near the gates with a grass area and tables. I asked if we would be able to order food, I was informed it was full service. Sounded great, so we headed to Penn Brewery for dinner.   Upon arrival, I discovered that the \"special area\" was an area about 10 feet outside of the restaurant courtyard gates with a sign designating it as the dog area where they would move a table for you. It was also next to a frontage road and adjacent to the freeway, which is not ideal for dining or conversation. I asked if there was anyway to sit on the outside of the other gate, the staff kindly accommodated my request.   Be prepared to not really dine in the outdoor restaurant area, but rather beyond the gates. The staff explained this is a state regulation they must follow, which I understand. However, I wish that the description on the phone would've been more accurate. Also this was not our first dog dining experience of this trip, but the first time we ran into such an awkward seating situation. As someone visiting from a very dog friendly area it would've been nice to know that if you want to bring your dog, you won't be getting the full restaurant experience, since the dog isn't allowed in the actual restaurant outdoor area.  Overall the staff was friendly and accommodating. They moved a table for us, they apologized and said they would pass along my note about the inaccurate phone description. However, I would opt for another restaurant if you want to dine with your pup with a less awkward sitting arrangement."}
{"text":"Oktoberfest 2017 was very disappointing.  I went on 9/16 with my wife and another couple.  We payed $65 each for VIP passes and were very disappointed with the event.  Except for having a VIP line to get drinks and food much quicker, it would have been far cheaper to just pay cash for what was included in our package.  The food was mediocre to say the least: pretzels were cold and the sauerkraut and German potato salad had absolutely zero flavor. It seemed that Penn Brewery was more interested in quantity of patrons rather than the quality of the event. Save your money, there are far better Oktoberfest events to attend."}
{"text":"Does not allow tiny Chihuahua in lap at outdoor tables on quiet afternoon - claiming they are \"not allowed\" at outdoor tables where there a many many Pittsburgh restaurants that do.  Seriously?  Guess they don't need the business - looked as though they did though."}
{"text":"Drove into town just becaus of the Yelp! reviews we read while passing thru Pennsylvania.  It was about an hour an a half out of our way, but I'd say it was worth it. My wife and I had the fish n'chips while the kids tried the pub burgers. We all thought the food was above average.   The portion sizes were large and tasty, and we all left feeling quite satisfied. The atmosphere was nice, considering the outside of the buidling - they've got a clean open restaurant that we really felt comfortable in.   The staff was all pretty hospitable, too. The only complaint is that when I asked about drinks, the waiter had to explain that every beer on the bottom half of the menu was out.    I understand a craft brewery having times when a particular brew will sell out or be replaced by a seasonal, but HALF THE MENU?   Let's be honest - I'm here for the beer.  I don't care a bit about your food, folks.   Even still, I found beer to drink, and it was a tasty Pils.  The lack of selection is all that kept these folks from getting my 5 star review."}
{"text":"Recently the revamped their menu and added some new choices! The chicken gyro and potato pancakes were soo good!"}
{"text":"WOW. What happened to this place?!?! It WAS one of my favorites.  Apparently a change in chef is partly to blame. He apparently has a thing for muenster cheese. This in turn has also produced a change in the menu - neither for the better.  My old standby was the Kielbasa Rueben, which is now the \"German\" Rueben. Which apparently means it can't have a potato pancake, sauerkraut, swiss cheese, or Russian dressing. It now comes with braised red cabbage, muenster cheese, and hot bacon dressing....a step down after sampling. The \"Northsliders\" from the app. menu are now also gone.   One 'positive' about the menu is that it seems everything on it is now available all day as opposed to having separate lunch and dinner menus.   Visiting on a GORGEOUS Saturday afternoon, like any normal person I wanted to dine al fresco. Nope, patio not open until 4. Whaaa? Ok whatever.   Tried the sausage platter and intended to try the Deutschtown burger.   Unfortunately since I only said 'burger' when I ordered I just got the basic or classic burger. Who orders one of those anyway unless it's on a kid's menu? I'll take the hit for that I guess, I should have been more clear. But apparently ordering it with no bun also means you don't get pickles or mustard. It was fine, but it sure isn't worth $10.   Same story with the sausage platter. $15 for 3 pieces of sausage? Where the only skill involved in preparing it is turning on the burner. And what kind of kielbasa is that? Not anything I grew up eating.   Disappointed in the changes....but at least the beer is still good!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed today! I've come to expect a pretty good German meal when I head to Penn Brewery. Today, however, was not that good meal. The menu has become Americanized. Sauerbraten was described as pot roast and served with potatoes. There was no spatzel to be had. The braised red cabbage was missing something. I was so sad. The pretzels with beer cheese was great. My husband's jaggershinzel was good. But, if you really want good German fare- go to Max's up the road on the North Side. Penn Brewery has just gone down hill."}
{"text":"If it is not Octoberfest, there is no reason to go. This place is completely overrated. The food is not good. I had pot roast and it was so sickly sweet. The schnitzel was overcooked to the point of mushy. It's not like the restaurant is supposed to be high end, but I expect more for $15 entrees esp. in Pittsburgh.  Sure you can go for the beer, but Penn Brewery beer is widely available in  many bars. It's not like the Octoberfest food is that good either.. You go more for the party."}
{"text":"Food OK.  Atmosphere awful.  Service unacceptable...not sure if this server was having a bad night or just hates their job.  Seemed overwhelmed and in the weeds, underpaid, and disinterested in customer satisfaction and/or our happiness, was annoyed at having to wait on other humans.  One word answers came short, saucy, and spicy.  Get a new and different job. Or get a better night's sleep. We were talking about the bad experience as we left. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place for a good German beer.  The Saint Nicholas Bock is one of my favorite seasonal brews. It's a great place to listen to live music and enjoy beer."}
{"text":"Their beer is awesome! And the traditional German food is a good option to turn to when you get sick of hot dog, hamburgers, and cheap steak..  You can actually see some of the brewing equipment in the restaurant itself and, in the summer, they open up the courtyard and turn it into a hap'nin beer garden.  Gotta visit this place is you are in Pittsburgh.  It's like our own, local, Hofbrauhaus."}
{"text":"Cool old building nice interior great staff.  Cool looking at brew stations behind large glass. .German beers are prominent though they offer pale ale & IPA each of these have a German flare.  Not saying that's bad just don't expect typical American beer styles.  Burger  & fries were good."}
{"text":"If your website says open until midnight, I should be able to get a beer at 11pm and not have you say \"We're closed\".  Learn how to run a business."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the sampler of the 10 beers they had on tap. Butcher's Plate was okay. Potato Pancakes a win. Sat a the bar. Se vic could have been better/more attentive, especially considering howany staff members were on the clock for a not very busy night."}
{"text":"Wanted to love this place. Loved the cute little courtyard, the building itself, the big wooden tables and benches.  And then I ate and drank here, and was extremely disappointed.  We were there on a Saturday afternoon, and it wasn't particularly crowded. There was no wait for a table, so we got seated right away and ordered a sampler of all the beers they had on tap that day. I think there were six of them that we sampled. Honestly, most of the beers were not particularly memorable, except for the Nut Roll Ale. This beer was pretty much the reason I wanted to try Penn Brewery, and it didn't disappoint. It was a nice, flavorful, aromatic brown ale, and it did indeed smell like your grandma's nut rolls. Perfect.  Unfortunately, nothing else was even close to perfect. The buffalo chicken pierogi ($6.95) were pretty good, but I prefer the traditional potato and cheese laden pierogi. We also ordered the beer cheese and crackers as an appetizer, but were brought a soup by accident. Our waitress was kind of a hot mess, and even after realizing the mistake, it took a good long while before it was corrected, and an even longer while before she eventually brought the check. Iffy service is not something that usually bothers me. I figure, restaurants/bars are busy, the waitstaff have a lot of crap going on, and it's gotta be a long day on your feet. But the service at Penn Brewery was SO beyond iffy that it's hard to even describe. Several times we were convinced that the waitress had forgotten we were there. For example, she would promise to bring out utensils which had been previously forgotten, and then she would disappear for 15 minutes, leaving our food to get cold while we waited semi-patiently for a fork.  Bottom line: The beer was good, the food average, at best, but the service was just awful. Hopefully this was an anomaly."}
{"text":"Food was sub-par, service below average...not our best experience here. It seems to have gone downhill, what a shame. We used to love this place...will not return."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Hell. I used to love this place. For the food, anyway. I'm not a beer drinker, but I'm into eating food. The service here, however, leaves something to be desired.  On previous visits to Penn Brewery we've enjoyed dining outside and have enjoyed the food. This week, we were excited there was a Craft Beer Week event here and the collaboration beers had the BF all in a tizzy. We made our way there (in rush hour and everything!), parked in the mini garage and made our way inside. Inside, it was a madhouse. The bar was jam packed. The tables were full. The hostess stand was abandoned. We awkwardly stood at the hostess stand since we were hoping to get some food while we were there. No one came, and no one came. When an employee finally came over, it was like he didn't know what a hostess stand was or how to operate said hostess stand. He was confused about what to do, handed us menus and told us we could sit anywhere. We snagged a table from two women who were about to leave and started to look over the menu. After a few minutes and no sign of a waiter, a waiter came over and asked us if we'd been seated here. Yes, we said, we were given menus and told we could sit here. 'Welllll (I'm channeling all three nasal-y Kardashians here), you can't sit here. There's a long wait.' But- b-b-b-b- the man said we could sit here :( 'Yeah, there's a really long wait.' This woman was SO rude. I was immediately peeved. We'd already been ignored, given false information and THEN rudely told to move like we were some sort of aliens trying to jump the 'wait' list. We were not offered to have our name put on the list while we waited at the bar, we were just told to MOVE IT. I looked at this rude waitress, looked at my accomplice, and said, \"CAN WE LEAVE?\" And we did. I tweeted them about it and they said 'We are very sorry about that! We'll let the staff know so we can prevent that in the future.' But what's done is done. And no free app or anything? Fuh-GET about this place and its shenans. If I need a raucous night of German beer drinking I'll head to Hofbrauhaus. Hmph!"}
{"text":"We hadnt been here in years. Unfortunately the quality of the food has seriously declined. The buffalo cauliflower was undercooked florets coated in red hot and Kraft blue cheese dressing. My flat bread was soggy.  My husband's German Reuben wasnt good either. The beer was ok. The service was very good but we left feeling pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"While visiting my hometown and family for the holidays I stopped by Penn Brewing to pay my final respects.  You may or may not know that after almost 23 years they are shutting it down as a result of raised rents on the space that they occupy which happens to be a century old brewery (the old Eberhart and Ober brewery on the Pittsburgh North Side).  If you are interested here is the latest story   http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08346/934287-46.stm    I won't go into it here as it has nothing to do with the review other than if  you are interested in their beer, food and atmosphere you better get over there and try it as the official last day of restaurant ops appears to be February 28, 2009.  They've brewed the last batch of beer on site as of late November and according to the article above will be dismantling the beautiful brew house.  I expect that the last two months will not be up to the standards that we've known for 23 years.  Other than my good byes I went to taste their Christmas seasonal the St. Nikolaus Bock. Which lived up to it's long standing standards.  Rich, roasty and complex this beer is the perfect pint or liter on a wet, cold winter afternoon.  I sat and enjoyed a couple while taking in for the last time the sights and sounds of the beer hall and beautifully displayed brew house.  Tom Pastorious (Founder) did a great job of converting this space to an authentic German beer hall complete with the rows of long tables and benches - I don't dare say picnic tables because they aren't.  When I walked in yesterday afternoon (December 26th) the place was packed but we elbowed our way to seats at the bar.  The crowds just complete the ambience and the feeling of being in an actual German bier hall.  We met two strangers at the bar and chatted for a good 30minutes - they were from out of town as well enjoying their final holiday pilgrimage to Penn Brewery.  After my first liter I grabbed the menu  (being the sucker for German food that I am) knowing what I would find on it having been here numerous times over the years.  Lynne and I split the JaegerSchnitzel as an afternoon snack.  It was served with a mini loaf of rye bread which was fresh, crunchy on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside and useful for mopping the wonderful mushroom laden sauce that makes this well - Jaeger and not just Viener Schnitzel.  A side of mashed potatoes and a side of red cabbage accompanied the schnitzel - both very good.  Yes, I'm on a plan next week - tis the season!  I've had other dishes here before.  The sausages as I recall are very good.  If you like/desire German fare and appreciate craft brewed beer this is a great destination.  Just as an aside Penn Brewery as they have for years made a showing at the Great American Beer Festival, Penn won two medals: a gold for Kaiser Pils and a bronze for Oktoberfest.  I doubt that they will be able to continue this tradition as The Lion will be contract brewing their beers which we all know means the possibly the quality and character can be impacted.  Let's keep our fingers crossed that they find a new location and can get back to their artisanal ways!    Auf Wiedersehen Penn Brewery!  at least and hopefully for a very short period of time."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow, but the food was DELICIOUS! There was a variety of people inside, some dressed up and some in athletic clothes."}
{"text":"Oktoberfest is here and this is a great time to try out Penn Brewery.  I have only been once since the Brewery reopened under new ownership and so glad they did. Their beers are delicious and highly recommend the Oktoberfest-a great fall beer.  Their Pumpkin Roll Ale is going to be released starting in mid October and I am looking forward to trying this new brew.  It rained the entire night for Oktoberfest but with the tents in the parking lot we were lucky to stay dry. We ate outside instead of insideso we did not order off the regular menu. The outdoor food choices were limited but what they did serve was tasty and perfect with the Oktoberfest. I highly recommend the German potato salad-one of my favorites since it isn't mayonnaise based. I also tried the pulled pork sandwich and bratwurst which was equally as good.  If you do decide to go to Oktoberfest (usually held the last two weeks in September) go early to get a table and beat the crowds.  Parking is very limited so this will ensure a good spot."}
{"text":"Another awesome stop on my first visit to Pittsburgh.  Penn Brewery is such a nice brewery to check out if you are in the area.  Pitt has a lot of small breweries around town and it might be hard to pick one but Penn Brewery is a must stop in my opinion.  Coming from Florida we have some amazing local brewers to choose from (Funky Buddha, Due South, etc) so I was excited to see what Pitt had to offer.  The building itself is very beautiful, all brick and very open in the front they even have outdoor seating when the weather is warm.  When you walk in all you can see is a big open and beautiful dining area, a huge bar and the brewery itself you can see through the glass.  There is also a downstairs area but we didn't go down there we stayed at the top to eat and drink.  When we sat down we got the bad news that they were out of the Pumpkin beer (it was October so they said they go through it fast).  So we decided to try the 10 glass sample of beer instead and it was perfect for the 3 of us.  We really loved the beer even the IPA they had was really interesting.  My favorite was the Penn Dark and my niece really like the Penn Gold.  The food....  We came in for lunch after working up a pretty good appetite walking around town.  There is a big polish influence in Pitt so there are lots of things on the menu that show that influence (think pirogues, and schnitzels).  I ordered the Schnitzel Sandwich (breaded pork cutlet sautéed and topped with grilled peppers, onions, mushrooms, vinegar slaw, Swiss cheese and Dijon mustard).  O M G!  This was delicious!!  I ate all of this sandwich I could not put it down.  It came with German potato salad, which apparently has vinegar in it and I wasn't a fan of that flavor combo.  It wasn't bad just not my thing.  I only ordered it at the suggestion of the server but I think it was more of a personal taste type thing.  My friend got the mac and cheese and it was good she ate it all.  The only thing I would say is she thought it was a bit greasy as it came with a lot of oil covering the top from the cheese.  My niece ordered the Kielbasa Reuben Sandwich, Pitts twist on a classic (thin sliced kielbasa, sauerkraut, thousand island dressing, Swiss cheese, and a potato pancake on grilled pumpernickel bread).  She loved it and there was nothing left of the sandwich she killed it. Definitely check out Penn Brewery if you can and get the Schnitzel Sandwich!!"}
{"text":"the atmosphere is shared picnic tables, some high tops,  funky lighting, views into the brewery.  I had the best ginger beer here i had in a month long cross country trip across the USA. DH and I shared an unusual  mushroom spaetzle which was rich, tasty and memorable.... we also had cheeses/ crackers for an appetizer.... Just awesome.. will make a stop back as there were several places in Pittsbugh we ran out of time to visit..."}
{"text":"Gosh, you must be sick, sick, sick of hearing about this everlasting road trip from Huntington Beach, CA to Philadelphia, PA. Well, if not, thank you for still reading! It took 5 days to get from Surf City to Steel City. We arrived at the Inn at the Mexican War Streets, a gothic mansion purchased in the early 80s by the existing owners for $100k, who, later got it appraised to have $100k worth of blood marble in around the fireplace alone. Nonetheless, it's an incredibly luxurious bed and breakfast for a fantastic price and an opportunity to be part of Pittsburgh's rich history.   The mister and I urban hiked to Penn Brewery, and while I don't have much to say about their beers besides being reminiscent of Budweiser, I do have to say their pretzels were delicious. Chewy and soft inside, the outside provided a pleasantly lye ridden crust. The Original Penn Beer Cheese - basically sharp cheddar blended with cream cheese and Penn pilsner - has become a memorable favorite cheese with the husband. I thought it had a nice bite, but nothing too crazy special. For $4.95 for two large pretzels and a good dose to beer cheese, Penn Brewery gets thumbs up for their knot, not for their beer."}
{"text":"I had one of the most authentic German Hefeweizens that I have found in the US, and I lived in Bavaria for 2 years.  It didn't have the head like the German brews do, but was still plenty fizzy.  It is also the first place in the US I have seen a Doner Kebob on the menu.  This is a common fast-food sandwich in Germany, the Turkish version of the Greek Gyro.  The lamb meat on mine was finely shredded, but the overall sandwich was good.  The vinegary, warm German potato salad was tasty also.  I also sampled the fries, which were somewhat overdone, and the Buffalo cauliflower appetizer, which was good.  The atmosphere was fine.  The water refills were a bit tardy."}
{"text":"I always thought Penn Brewery wasn't as cool as some of the new hipster craft breweries.  I STAND CORRECTED! Mr. Bartender was super nice and let me try sips of many options without the slightest bit of attitude. The oyster-based beer was by far the most surprisingly good, and the chocolate stout was my fav.  And the food, THE FOOD!  I was shocked to even find many yummy Vegan friendly options!  We settled on the house-made soft pretzels and cheese, and were not disappointed.  I'm so sad my snobbery kept me from this delightful gem all these years. I can't wait to walk my pup over and enjoy the outside area this summer!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in my steak last night. Over half of it was fat and I could not even eat it. Again the beer is awesome. Next time I will not order a meal and just get pretzels or another appetizer. Also, my companions did not really care for their food either."}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  We got the burger. It was one of the best burgers we've ever had.  It's great German American food all around.  The beer was really good. Our favorites we're the hefewizen, the nut roll, and the hot ginger beer.  All were great, uniquely delicious beers."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place! Beer in authentic German style, the pub food follows suit. All food offerings tasty and exhibit deeply savory developed flavors that shine! The staff is attentive and customer friendly. Most especially Chad the bartender! He is funny, friendly and so kind. The Penn beer samplers are the wtg for first timers. We love the seasonal offerings as well! A must are the pretzels & beer cheese."}
{"text":"Very nice venue, partook in the outside seating...it was wonderful, food was great, as was the beer and service... had a unique Reuben, composed of thin sliced Kielbasa, excellent!...only negative, which was huge, was that they allowed smoking in the center of the courtyard...unfortunately we sat where a chain smoker was seated at the bar...spoke to a manager, but he was not sure of policy...did speak to the smoking gentleman, who left, but was immediately replaced by another...the solution is to move the smoking area out to one of the courtyard perimeter locations!... once that is accomplished, I would rate this as one of the best brewery restaurants in the city!"}
{"text":"Very good food but small portions. (We only got three pierogis for an appetizer that cost $7!) The beer was amazing, though (St. Nicks)!"}
{"text":"I went with my sister last week. Sorry for a late review!  I enjoy the potato pancakes!  The use there own apple sauce and sour cream concoction.  The pancakes a thick and full of potatoes!! Everything together was awesome!  The portions are huge.  They're each the size of a saucer plate. If you get a opportunity to visit Penn Brewery.., try the potatoes!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great atmosphere. Good prices. Friendly staff. All around winner. I got a Reuben and my girlfriend got a burger.  Both were fantastic my girlfriend loved the craft beer. Bartender was very polite"}
{"text":"Legit Oktberfest brew and one of the best brats I've had- ever. (Bonus: staff were using Murphy's Oil Soap to clean all of the nice wood in the place - the only way to take care of your finest wood pieces.) Great spot!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations after looking them up online, seeing their friendly staff, tasty food, and great atmosphere. Unfortunately, the atmosphere and service was very disappointing. The food took a long time and the beers were tapped very messy. ALSO, you had to walk all the way around the building, then walk upstairs just to go back downstairs to find the restrooms. It was unacceptable considering they would not open a door that would have made the bathroom a lot closer. Overall disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been a few times- biggest down side for those who are gluten free; no beer options. I didn't see a wine list while I was there either. Another down side is the lack of gluten free dishes --going to Penn Brewery as a gluten free person is a typical \"I guess I'm getting a salad\" experience. However, I really enjoyed their grilled chicken salad- the chicken was cooked perfectly. It was a very nice portion size as well. I've also gotten the steak cob salad --pretty good too. Nothing out of this world, but I know my non-gluten free friends love the food and beer options.  They have a patio out back that looks like a fun time in warm weather to go with friends- I would go back just for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beer was good but food was mediocre at best. I will not be going there ever again because I did not feel welcome. Not impressed with service."}
{"text":"This review is for drinks only. I was so excited to try this place out after growing up in Pittsburgh then moving out of state but I must say - It was just alright. Compared to many of the other breweries popping up in the area, they have very few beers on tap and not a very wide range of beer styles. I had the seasonal (I think an Oktoberfest) and it was OK.  The atmosphere was dark and pretty crowded at the bar, but the restaurant area was more open (though not any brighter).   I would return to try the food because I've heard good things, but I wasn't impressed by their beers (and they're a brewery!)"}
{"text":"Fantastic home made style German food . Their poutine is amazing.  Friendly staff an well made brews. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"We visited Penn Brewery on a weekend evening, there were 5 of us.   The building itself is clearly old, but has been kept really well and didn't have that can't-get-the-dirt-off feel to it. There was casual seating, a nice bar up top, and quieter, cozier seating down the stairs near the beer. It definitely still had the feel of a brewery!  Everybody was happy with their food, and liked the beer as well. Personally I had some of the sausage stuffed peppers (so good, and gluten free! it's so rare to see GF stuffed peppers) and a bunless burger with fries. Everything was delicious.   We had a little snafu with our seating when we arrived, but it was made up to us in spades with a few free beers!!! I was pleased to see that the place puts their customers first and could sense we were a little uncomfortable. It made the night a lot better.   I would return if I lived in the area!"}
{"text":"I love the beer here... Duh!  But, the menu is disappointing for a veg. That being said, they are trying to do the whole German thing, and I did have the same food issues in CZ. So, I guess they are winning in authenticity. I think the only things I can eat here are beer cheese pretzels and desserts... SO, really... I can't complain tooo much :)"}
{"text":"YUM! I've been to Penn Brewery a couple times and have to say, I really, really enjoy eating at this place and I am so glad it's part of Pittsburgh! Well done German food + authentic German beers: what's not to like?  The first time I stopped in was for lunch and I fell in love immediately. The place wasn't hopping but that was fine by me - my dining companion and I had plenty of room to stretch out in their tavern/hall-like dining area as we peered into the brewery and tried remembering which flags on the walls and in the rafters represented which countries. For our meal, we ordered their ginger beer - an excellent brew! - and a specialty veal sandwich (which I wish they'd add to the menu full-time!), amazing pierogies and an absolutely delicious green salad. Seriously, you know you're doing something right when I get super happy about a salad - what's not to like about being able to eat well without giving up taste? This one had smoked pork belly, dried cranberries, mozzarella, and almonds dressed with garlic oil vinegar. Talk about yummy!  My second visit was during dinner hours with a group of friends, and I honestly think I'll be sticking to lunch only visits. The place was much more packed in the evening and once you added in loud music, it was impossible to talk to anyone at my table aside from the person right next to me. Not cool - if I'm out with friends, I want to be able to talk to them. Still, the food was as awesome as ever - we split the fried pickles (quite unusual in this city, I think, but not bad) and I continued my streak of ordering \"healthier\" options here by getting the portobello stack. Given it's price I wouldn't have minded a bit more food on my plate - but it was still VERY good. Well cooked (but not overdone) mushrooms plus tomatoes plus creamy goat cheese and dressing - what a simple but delectable combination. Seeing as I'd eaten beer and pizza at work that day, a dinner of just vegetables sounded perfect, and it's good to know that Penn Brewery's menu isn't entirely comprised of heavy German food, a common sin of restaurants that offer it.  I definitely plan on stopping in to sample more of their sandwiches, appetizers and burgers the next time I want to go out for lunch - just thinking about trying their Deutschtaun Burger and their flatbreads makes my mouth water!"}
{"text":"Service is friendly but can be hit or miss.  The menu is full of steady and consistent offerings paying homage to the neighborhood's German roots. Penn Brewery is a great place for a stick to your ribs meal in the winter and their Biergarten is wonderful for kicking back with a pint and relaxing with friends in warmer weather. It is waaaay more than just a place to celebrate Oktoberfest (but of course those festivities should not be missed either.)"}
{"text":"My German boyfriend was craving German food and hates Hofbrahaus, so we went to Penn Brewery. He... did not get the German food that he wanted. We started off with the Potato Pancakes and they were okay, but some of the potato slivers seemed a little undercooked and they definitely needed some seasoning. I liked my meal - the Kasespaetzle, but it was not authentic. It was just little noodle dumplings in a creamy macaroni and cheese sauce. It was delicious, but I wouldn't call it German food and my boyfriend didn't like it. He had the Schweinebraten, which was okay. He found the sauerkraut to be unappetizing and I don't remember what beer we ordered, but it tasted like the bottom of the keg. It tasted nearly skunked. Gross. We will probably come back and hopefully get beer that isn't on its last legs. It's cool that you can see the brewery through the windows."}
{"text":"Great selection of German style beers! Located in a very old brick building with an upstairs and a downstairs. The upstairs had a great view of the brewery (brew action) tabled and chairs and a big bar. The downstairs looked like it was for a private event or large parties. Only stopped here for a beer but next time I would love to try the German food here! Service was great! Even got a tshirt!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and architecture. Weisen beer was good although bottled. Had every appetizer last night for a work party and every one was bad. Beer cheese pretzel had a side of cheese if I didn't know better was cheez wiz.t"}
{"text":"We were there today for the 2nd annual King of the Wing Festival.  VIP Tickets cost us $35 each and that gave us 3 hours (2pm-5pm) of unlimited wings from any of 40 or so Pittsburgh area restaurants/bars.  The cheapest tix were $25 and allowed you in from 3-5pm.  The vendors were great!  The options were awesome.  Some of the flavors were not to our liking (maple syrup/real bacon bit wings anyone?), some wings were undercooked (bloody bones inside anyone?).  But some of the vendors hit it out of the park (Big Shot Bobs dry rub is AWESOME!).  We had all kinds of flavors- Jamaican jerk, Cajun, ghost pepper smoked, and tons more.  The reason I'm only giving this 3 stars is because Penn Brewery 'dropped the ball' in several important areas- The outdoor beer stands were cash only.  Who carries cash anymore?  So we headed indoors only to find their ATM machine OUT OF ORDER!  And to get to the ATM you had to leave the parking lot where the event was held and walk completely around to the front of the building to get in.  The gate separating the lot from the restaurant was padlocked!  Why not open it and put a couple I'd checkers on chairs at the gate???  They then put out a single bottled water machine- up on the top lot IN THE SUN!  Then later on they set up a water table in the lower lot (which was shaded) but the water wasn't even iced.  $35 a person and they can't put ice in the water???  There was also a malfunctioning hand wash station- you step on the pedal and the water squirted out all over your feet.  At least there was soap- which I had to rinse off with water from the drinking water table.  I don't know what management was doing but I'm guessing they were oblivious to the issues.  Or maybe they were just too busy counting their money...  Smh..."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for German style beers and food. I stopped by here on a Sunday afternoon. It wasn't very busy. The interior is in the style of a German beer hall with long tables with benches and also seating at the bar.   They have some year round beer selections which are similar to the choices you would have at a German beer hall. There's a light beer, a dark beer and a Hefeweizen. I got the dark beer. It was excellent and tasted quite similar to the beers I have had when visiting Germany. The taste was very clean and refreshing. They also have some seasonal beers and IPAs but it seems better to stick with their specialities.   Their menu was fairly large and I decided to get the German Reuben. It was a little pricey at $14 but was worth it. It had very moist and tasty warm sausage slices and warm red cabbage between pumpernickel bread. The only thing I didn't like so much was the hot potato salad because of the sweet glaze.   The interior has a nice dark ambience with a large screen and smaller screen behind the bar that was playing a soccer game. I also saw a very nice outdoor patio.   I'd definitely recommend a visit here if you're a fan of German beers and food."}
{"text":"i remember this place in the days when it was called the allegheny brewery and pub.  it is actually called the penn brewery and pub now.  the food and beer has stayed the same but the music venue has changed.  a great place for german style beer brewed locally in da burgh.  food is decent mix of german style foods and american pub classics.  best beers are oktoberfest, st niklaus bock, and of course the penn pilsner.  back in the day there was a band that played regularly here called the barons, they were the best pub band ever!!!  they would start the evening with german folk songs and then their style of polka would get your feet rocking and your palate thirsty for the pilsner.  that all warmed you up for the final set of classic 60's dance tunes.  nowadays the restaurant has a german violin accordian duo on wednesdays, and solo accordian on saturdays.  not the same band but still love that music.  definitely can't miss this place on oktoberfest, lively, festive, lots of folk dancing.  if you are really into polka, browse polkareview.com  they even have one of the barons CDs on their sale list called german sampler."}
{"text":"Visiting from out today of town. After imbibing at Southern Tier the night before, this was a huge step down. Beer was watery, bland and flavorless and lacked carbonation. The bartenders demeanor was colder than the beer. We left after half our flight and went to Allegheny Brewery instead."}
{"text":"The menu is cool. I got the Chicken pirogues that were stuffer with a chicken and buffalo mixture and topped with a blue cheese sauce. It looked like a mess but tasted good. I also had what I thought to be one of the most different items on a menu in a long time Kielbasa Rueben.  The sandwich was just okay. I would have like to taste more of the kielbasa the bread was very over powering. There was also a potato pancake in the middle but couldn't really taste it much. Place was nice inside and I would go back and recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The atmosphere is great and so are the beers (highly recommend the 10 beer sampler so you can find out what you like).  The German food is also top notch.  Being of the Schnitzel loving persuasion, I was in heaven.  The piece was as big (or bigger) than my face.  The Kartoffelsalat and Spaetzle were really well done.  Had to sit at a small bar table, as the place was packed, so maybe get there early?  Not really an issue otherwise."}
{"text":"Penn Brewery has been a staple in Pittsburgh for a long time (1986 to be exact). While lots of other breweries have been popping up in Pittsburgh Penn has always stood its ground and continued to keep its character. Penn is in the Deutschtown district of Pittsburgh (North Side) and started its journey doing what I feel they still do the best and thats brewing authentic German style beers. In the past few years Penn has expanded their brewing abilities to add IPA's and seasonal beers to their list.    The atmosphere at Penn Brewery is great. They are located in an old nineteenth century brick building with an awesome biergarten located within it's walls. They offer both upstairs and downstairs seating with views of the brewing process.   Penn also offers one of the best Pittsburgh style restaurants in the city. The restaurant offers many authentic German old world dishes like schnitzel, Wurst, strudel etc. They also offer an extensive menu of Burgers, Sandwiches, Salads (with fries of course), and vegetarian offerings.     Overall Penn Brewery is a major part of the city of Pittsburgh and has what you are looking for in a great brewery. As far as i'm concerned Penn Brewery keeps the old Pittsburgh feel we all love alive and well while continuing to serve great beers and food. A must stop while exploring the city or hanging out with friends and family."}
{"text":"Best Hefeweizen and Fried Cheese curds ever!  So the Penn Weizen beer here is phenomenal. Light but flavorful and just a very refreshing beer.  The winner here is the fried cheese curds. I was blown out of the water with how great these darn things were! The batter/breading was VERY light but VERY crunchy and salty which was amazing. The cheese curds themselves were squeaky, melted and oooooooooo soooooo good.  Were also ordered the Sweet Sriracha Wings and Pomme-Frites. The Pomme-Frites (Fries with chili, bacon, sour cream, cheese and scallions) were disappointing. THey were smothered which was good but bad. The fries turned to mush (did not hold up to the chili) but the chili was decent, not great, but decent.  The Wings, ehhhh I've had better and for the price I wouldn't get them again. The wings weren't that big in size and the sauce, while okay, needed a bit more sauce. When i hear sriracha I expect to be punched in the mouth a bit lol, more sweet than spice.  Overall though, I'd stop in for the beer and curds any day which is why this place gets 5 stars, after all they are a brewery!"}
{"text":"I like german food and good German beer. Penn Brewery had both Their Penn Dark is GREAT."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite brewery in town based off the quality alone. They had like two fruity beers and one wheat with banana undertones which makes me want to do some day drinking on a regular basis! As for the other beers, even if it's not my typical choice they are still solid tasty beers. I heard from a local that this place has been around forever, but is starting to lose some business because of other establishments cooler appearance, outside games, dog friendly, etc. I can see the appeal in all the additions I just listed, but if you are in the mood for just good quality beer without all the other frills, this is the place to go! Oh and to top of the delicious beer, the food is really good here too!"}
{"text":"Penn Brewery was my destination after a long day's work in Pittsburgh.  I arrived around 9pm on a Tuesday and grabbed a seat without a problem.  I sat at a table right near the glass separating the eating area and the fermenting tanks.  Very cool view there.  I forgot what I ordered, specifically, although I do know it was some sort of sandwich.  The fries here were awesome and so was the Penn-Weizen!  I had a 22oz glass and almost ordered another, but sadly declined because I had to leave quickly after eating.  The view of the brewery is pretty sick once you arrive.  It almost looks sketchy at night, but that's just because it has an old warehouse look to it and I walked down the alleyway to enter the brewery."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Penn Brewery and if you don't know me I am a bit of a booze hound. I love beer! All types, all colors, all ABV's. So I ran in here today for lunch but I  am not allowed to imbibe during work hours. Woe is me....the world is not fair! My point is if you enjoy a beer, just about any type...this is the place to start. I have been here 10+ times and this was my only non-drinking visit.   I enjoyed the Braumeister Steak Sandwich with fries. The food, service and atmosphere were great. Try to find the time to visit this place. Well worth the stop."}
{"text":"After many visits to Penn Brewery, I have to say I'm usually more a fan of their food than their beer.  Their seasonals are often my favorites, like the Oktoberfest.  I've also recently discovered their Summer Berry Weiss and enjoyed it so much that I finally purchased a Penn Brewery growler.  They make some pretty tasty German fare here that never disappoints.  My go-to has often been the amazing sausage platter.  On my most recent trip I did a 180 and went for the Beer Garden Burger and could not have been happier with the selection.  I'm far from being a vegetarian, but this burger was something I would definitely eat again.    They also host some awesome events such as their own Oktoberfest, a Brewfest featuring other local/regional offerings and most recently the Northside Sandwich Sampler.  Thursdays during the summer they have the Beer Garden open for cheap drinks and food.    I've been here when it's jam-packed busy and I've been here when I thought they were closed because there were only two other patrons.  Not much of a bar area, but tables both upstairs and down.  Regardless of the time of day or number of other customers, the service, food and beer have always been good.  Drink local."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars. It's been years since my first visit to Penn Brewery, so I wanted to refresh my memory while I was back in the area. First, it's not in the most convenient location up on Troy Hill, but still pretty easy to get to from either Route 28 or I-279. Parking is a little on the rough side, in a gravel lot across the street. That's apparently an issue for some, but I could care less...it's free! Can't say that about very many places in the city.  After walking through the courtyard and walking up the stairs, I noticed the lunchtime crowd wasn't too busy. I read through the Penn Brew drafts listed on the chalkboard behind the bar and decided to try the Penn Dark (of course). The I looked at the menu and saw this:  \"Bacon Brew Dog: A natural-casing hot dog stuffed with fresh jalapenos, wrapped in bacon, then deep-fried and topped with BBQ sauce, shredded cheddar Jack cheese, and vinegar slaw in a hot dog bun.\"  SAY WHAT!?  I told the bartender that's what I wanted and he grinned and said \"Oh, those are really good. I haven't had one in awhile. Nice choice.\"  Long story short, it was awesome! I probably could've eaten two of them, albeit I would've paid the price for it dearly later on. The friendly bartender also let me sample some of the other brews, including Penndemonium (Brewer's Choice Series) and Summer Berry Weiss (seasonal), both smooth, refreshing and sweet.  I'm very happy I revisited Pittsburgh largest and oldest brewery, but slightly bummed I missed out on their $3 Happy Hour drafts. Good thing to remember for next time."}
{"text":"Penn Brewery isn't only a cool place to grab a cold beer, they also serve some very tasty food.   We came here on a Saturday in September to celebrate Oktoberfest.  We were a little early so we missed the bands that played later in the day, but we still got to enjoy the beer and food for the occasion.  We decided to go with a quart of Oktoberfest beer to share.  Fall beers are amongst some of my favorite alcoholic delights.  Penn Brewery makes a mighty tasty Oktoberfest-style beer.  To go along with that we split an order of traditional potato and cheese pierogi, and a sausage platter that had three different types of sausages with sauerkraut and a German hot potato salad.  While we waited for our food we enjoyed the outdoor biergarten, which is pet friendly and spacious.    Our food was delivered and it was a nice portion so splitting it worked out great.  We came with my little brother and his girlfriend and they both ordered the fish sandwich, which in hindsight they could have split one since neither finished their sandwiches.  In other words, expect large portions.  The sausages were great dipped in some mustard.   I also enjoyed the pierogis and sauerkraut but totally could pass on the potato salad.   Way too sweet for my liking.  Overall great place to hang with friends or family and share a beer and some good German style grub."}
{"text":"Delicious food and super engaging staff. Tried the five beer flight and split a chocolate meltdown. Had the Wurst Baguette and the kielbasa had a phenomenal snap. Add some mustard and sauerkraut to the toasted pretzel roll and it was unbeatable. Got the cheese curds for an appetizer and the crunchy breading with mustard was delicious too. I'd come back any time."}
{"text":"Penn Brewery has a great atmosphere and reminds me of a more \"local\" version of the big chain German beer restaurant you can find in South Side works. Their draft list has a selection of favorites and some seasonal choices, all brewed in house. My husband and I elected to share some apps, the German potato salad, Pierogies, and potato pancakes. The pancakes were dynamite! The menu looks promising and the inviting atmosphere makes me want to come back sometime in the spring or summer, especially since I noticed that the bike trail goes directly to their little private parking lot. Looking forward to a return visit!"}
{"text":"While my family was in town for Christmas, we decide to go to Penn brew on a Wednesday night for dinner. Of the 6 of us who ordered, 4 of us could not get what we wanted because the restaurant had run out. We were informed that they were out of all pierogies(in all varieties), all spaetzle, and vegetarian sausage. We were only informed that the potato and cheese pierogies were out after two people order them.   The wait staff, although trying to be accommodating , seemed a bit over their head and there seemed to be a complete disconnect between the front and back of the house.  When the orders finally arrived, one of the orders was wrong, making 5 out of 6 orders not what people wanted. Keep in mind that this was at 7:30pm, not late night when I would expect a restaurant to run out of food.  The food that did arrive was pretty mediocre. The steak sandwiches were tough and dry. The fries were good. The salads had too much red onion. The potato soup was bland except for being too salty. The appetizers we had were pretty good but the grilled veg that cam with the hummus was cold.  The only thing positive of this visit was that the beer was good."}
{"text":"I go to their Oktoberfest every year, I would not miss it.  I love the live music, the great food, dancing, and of course the fabulous beer.  But it's nice to go back occasionally when things are less hectic and crowded, and what I get is really good German food and some of the best beers made in Pittsburgh.  There's an Old World taste to the beer made here and it's authentic and satisfying.  The Penn Brewery is a real gem!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come here for a while and seeing them on groupon finally gave me the kick I needed to check it out. We went on a Monday evening around 7:30. I was shocked with how small the place was. Maybe I am just comparing it too much to Hofbrauhaus, but it is teeny in comparison. The beer garden area was empty when we arrived- probably due to it being overcast. I LOVED their beer garden- it felt like we weren't in Pittsburgh! We were sat right away in the beer hall, in a typical German style table. Our server was friendly and told us about their beer. Considering I have had their beer on many occasions (and honestly am not impressed), I skipped ordering one. Instead, we went straight for the food.   There were three of us and we each ordered our own appetizer- hot wings, fried pickles and hummus. The wings were average- the sauce didn't stick to them (probably too much butter in the sauce), but they were ok. The fried pickles were awesome! Decent amount for the price and they were huge. The hummus wasn't good. I am not sure what I was thinking, ordering hummus at a German restaurant, but now I know not to do so again. It was flavorless and the pita was very greasy.  We each ordered a different sandwich for our meal. I ordered the BLT with house candied bacon (how AMAZING does that sound?), my boyfriend ordered the German style Reuben and our friend ordered the steak sandwich. They each had fries with their sandwich but I upgraded to the mac & bier cheese. The BLT was awesome- TONS of sweet, delicious bacon, fresh mozzarella slices, tomatoes, lettuce and balsamic, with a soft and tasty bun. I loved it. The mac & bier cheese was disappointing- the bier cheese didn't have a lot of flavor, but I ate it anyway. The portion was HUGE and was enough for dinner the next day. My boyfriend said his Reuben was good, but didn't love it. Our friend really liked his steak sandwich.  We all agreed that we would like to come back but I won't be rushing here anytime soon, unless it's to hang out in that adorable beer garden!"}
{"text":"This microbrewery had an amazing concept. The building used to be the former Eberhardt and Ober Brewery (founded in 1848). You walk in and you can see so much history. We walked in by mistake to the alley and it looked like a Spanish bodega. The ambiance was so relaxed. Food is amazing....German inspired comfort food and German style beers. We had two beers. Of the two, one that stood out was the Penn Weizen. It's a wheat beer with yeast that produces a unique flavor of banana and cloves with a dry and tart edge, some spiciness, and notes of apples....a little hoppy bitterness, and a moderate level of alcohol. It was amazing. The Penn IPA was right there with hop-forward flavor notes. Overall, I would come back here whenever I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"This place serves good beer and good brew pub food. I had the sausage platter. Loved to kielbasa and the Penn Pilsner bratwurst. Thought the chicken sausage was bland. The German hot potato salad tasted sweat. I thought it would almost be a dessert. My daughter had the chili. Good flavor not spicy. Son had the pirogis. I tried one of his, there was nothing special about them. The two other adults had salads. They said they were good.   I tried the nut roll ale. I enjoyed this holiday beer because of the cinnamon and vanilla. It almost reminded me of root beer. They sell beer to go. I took home a seasonal sampler. $19 for a twelve pack.  My wife isn't into brew pub food. However, I would come back for the beer first and the food second."}
{"text":"I went here with some friends after work.  I tried their nutroll beer for Christmas and their pretzels and cheese dips. They were good.  I was told Santa Claus would be there but I had to leave before he arrived. A cute German beer garden."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, German beer and food is a personal passion.  That said, Penn Brewery stands out among the really excellent similar establishments I've visited across the country.  My wife and I visited Pittsburgh recently (I love the town BTW), and we made a point of having brews and dinner there; we were not disappointed.    Food was very good; we had pork loin and the sausage platter as well as potato pancakes (delicious!).  We sampled their different brews, but the dark lager was clearly the favorite and it compared quite favorably to the best German brews that I have tasted over the years.  Our server was very attentive and we never had to wonder where he was.  The food was presented promptly as was the beer.  I'm looking forward to our next visit to this outstanding establishment."}
{"text":"By far one of the worst experiences I've ever had. the place we sat at didn't have a light so we were in darkness, asked the waitress to see if she if she can change it she basically told me to politely fuck off. Didn't have half the beer on the list. Waited two hours to receive food. Waitress came to our table every 30 minutes! Waited another 30 mins to get out beer.  My friend got cold pirogies.... I have been waiting for my check now for 30 minutes as well. Never ever again. I will never return to penn brewery and I recommends that no one ever goes here. If it wasn't for for my friends I would've thought I was in hell."}
{"text":"-=Penn is mightier than the Sword=-  Penn Marzen. Flavourful Amber. Smooth. Private Brewery Tour. Good to be Out-of Towner. Appreciate Friendly staff and educational Tour.  This Brewpub serves European cuisines. Like the old-school outer-and-interior setting.  Lunch Sausage Platter. Normal cuisine. Friend. Ate. Steakburger w/Spatzle.  3.5'd I heard Good News from this Friend."}
{"text":"Love the beer, the outdoor courtyard is really great, octoberfest here is fun."}
{"text":"Came up here on Wednesday for a little supervisory luncheon (and note to the taxpayers, we did pay for it ourselves).  Penn Brewery is probably one of the oldest microbreweries/brew pubs around.  I can't vouch for their beers since I'm a non-drinker but their lunches here are really good.  Penn Brewery is meant to emulate a German bierstube and the atmosphere here is just so gosh darn fun, it almost doesn't matter if the food is any good.  Well not quite.  Who wants to eat lousy food?   I can't remember what the others ate, but we did start off with an order of  Penn Brewery beer cheese, flavored with their house brew.  I believe one of my coworkers had the scnitzel sandwich but I went for the sausage baguette--a grilled bratwurst with sauerkraut.  Mmmmm, I love stinky food!  Kiss me Rick, darling!"}
{"text":"I love this brewery! So many menu choices to choose from we couldn't decide! The steak salad was delicious. The pierogis were different but my mom enjoyed them. Tons of beer choices as well. Can't wait to come back to try all of the other food and beer choices."}
{"text":"Okay for beer lovers.  Quite loud and the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Service was poor and very slow.  Not sure if our server had too many tables at once or what the problem was.  She was nice, just did not have things timed out right at all.  We waited 20 minutes for our check then another 10 to get it back.  I hope this improves future service."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere! Good quality German food and beer. They had a ginger beer that was tasty. Schnitzel was good. Our waiter was nice and was quick to joke with us when we said silly things. If you want German food, skip Hofbrau and come here!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Very authentic food and beer well prepared with great service and first rate entertainment.  1,000 times better than Hofbräuhaus"}
{"text":"Went here on my last trip to Pittsburgh. I've been here several times years ago. I had the jaegerschnitzel with sauerkraut instead of potato's. The food was excellent breaded very lightly and not tough. It had a nice mushroom sauce on top of the schnitzel. The vegetable was broccoli I think which excellent. Then there was the beer. They brew their own here so I tried an IPA. Very tasty. I sat at the bar and the dining was very casual."}
{"text":"We were there this past weekend WoW they cannot keep up with a crowd they totally screwed up our entire order there were eight of us could not get our orders straight some food came at the same time others did not Really we where ordering major drinks and food and still total disregard for the money that was being spent you need to train your staff on customer service try taking lessons from restaurants like Meditrano on Babcock Boulevard Nicki's Ty North Side Customer Service they will make or break you Group On don't fall for the discount not worth it Don't waste your money"}
{"text":"Last weekend our travels took us to the West side of PA, a little known town by the name of Pittsburgh.  While visiting friends and family, the minute we walked into the door before our bags even hit the floor, our hosts said 5 words.  \"Let's go to a brewery.\"  The dude abides.  So despite just getting out of a car we were in for 7+ hours, it was right back into one, as we headed to Penn Brewery.  On the north side of town, Penn Brewery is the Burgh's oldest and largest brew house, and we were   happy to pay a visit.  As you see from our photos, its attempts to model itself after European Beer gardens is a welcome sight.  Apparently this part of town was heavy on the German settlers, so they had their influences correct.  But how was the beer?  Here are a few we sampled with some notes.  1.  Penn Pilsner - this is their flagship.  They pride themselves on it.  A German style brewery prides itself on a Bohemian style beer.  Interesting.  They claim it's smooth & mellow.  I was not alone at our table when I say it was neither.  It was bitter, it was in your face hops, it was heavy.  Light to the eyes, heavy to the gut.  Not a fan.  This was a NO.    2.  Penn Dark - This one would be more my style.  Dark, heavy, Munich style Dunkel.  It had what a dark should have.  Roasty malt scents and flavors, a bit of bitter countered with a bit of sweet, still a little heavy on the hops, but a big improvement over the Pilsner.  This was a YES.    3. Penn Weizen - We are all familiar with this style, the nice Bavarian wheat.  Several award winner according to them, including a Men's Journal top 25 beers in America.  Bold statement.  But it stood up to the test.  This is one of my favorite styles, I could tell easily if you screwed it up.  Penn gets a YESon this one.     4. St. Nikolaus Bock - Very malty, extremely dark and heavy, warming gut, sweetness to the taste and the nose, this was the one.  If we had had this one around Christmas time it may have been a winner.  Or very close 2nd.  This was a good one, my fave of the day, and would definitely get again.  YES.  Unfortunately the road weariness played a huge part in how few beers we sampled this night.  But what started out negatively with the Pilsner, ended very strong with the Nikolaus.  Penn Brewery is more than OK in our books.  Wrap Up;  Had some TVs ready to watch the Pens game, decent different beers, and nice menu of apps.  Good alternative to a sports bar for sure."}
{"text":"Man, we had such a fantastic time here last night!  The Boilermaker Jazz Band was playing, filling the hall with cool 1940's style swing and jazz.  I was actually glad to wait for a table, so the hubby and I could enjoy the show.  The beers were good, and I especially recommend the Marzen and Bock.  Seating is family style, so you'll likely be seated next to strangers if the place is busy.  We like meeting new people, so talking it up with our table-mates and listening to the band made it feel like a party.  A party with 5 different types of wusrt, that is!  I highly recommend starting with the KÄSE kugel mit speck, which is basically German mac and cheese. Topped with bacon.  Oh yeah.  I'm looking forward to their Mardi Gras celebration!"}
{"text":"After trying their Oktoberfest (and thoroughly enjoying it) at other Pittsburgh locations, my family and I decided to come and check out the Penn Brewery for an afternoon feast and some brews. Shockingly, they were completely out of their Oktoberfest and it was only early October. (And yes I am completely aware that Oktoberfest traditionally takes place in September not October, but totally not my point). The fact is, if you're an established brewery you should know how much to brew of your seasonals as to satisfy the masses well into the fall months.  We ended up doing a flight of 9 of their other beers. I particularly enjoyed the Penn Pilsner and Penn Dark but was not very impressed by many of their others. However, I'm not a huge fan of hops and high gravity beers and their were quite a few of these on the flight. However, in my mind since I've tried both their Oktoberfest and their seasonal St. Nikolaus Bock (also phenomenal) their beer is still pretty stellar in my opinion.  We ended up getting a bunch of different things and sharing them for lunch. We had the traditional pierogi platter, the potato pancakes, the goulash soup, a side of spatzle, several sides of German potato salad, and the schnitzel sandwich. I was particularly impressed with the German potato salad, which was served warm and was absolutely delicious. The schnitzel sandwich was also excellent. It was a breaded pork cutlet, served with grilled peppers, onions, and mushrooms, and topped with a vinegar slaw, Swiss cheese, and Dijon mustard.   Sadly, the day was rainy and we weren't able to enjoy the outdoor courtyard. However, sitting on the large wooden benches with a view of the brewing system through a large glass window was wonderful.  I would certainly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Went mainly for the colaboration beer for Pitt Beer Week. Sat at the bar and sampled mostly everything. Posted our beer reviews on Untappd. They were all good. Didn't have any food. Love older breweries that keep their history."}
{"text":"The best time to go to Penn Brewery is on a weeknight, so you can get seated right away and comfortably. We got a table in the main dining room and luckily not at one of the picnic style tables.   To drink - I ordered the Penn Weizen - it was delicious and I might have ordered a second .  My dad got the Penn IPA, but didn't enjoy it - so he got the Penn Gold instead.   For an appetizer- we ordered the pretzels (they come by 4 an order) so perfect for sharing. However, the last pretzel was under cooked. We reported it to our waitress (and fortunately the manager was able to take of the pretzels on our bill).   For dinner - I ordered the pretzel crusted cod sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was on a Breadworks roll. I enjoyed it very much and may have eaten it all. I would definitely get it again.   Heads up - trivia starts at 8pm on Monday's, but they play in the downstairs beer hall."}
{"text":"Lederhosen Optional!  My first visit was Oktoberfest.  Oktoberfest was a blast!   Great people, good beer, and tons of character / atmopshere for the event.   Penn Brewery throws a great party.   I have been to some pretty large Oktoberfest (Cincinnati) where all of downtown is closed.    This place had all the character and fun as the larger festivals.  The place was packed - always a good sign.   The beer was awesome.   I did not try the food - but it looked good as well.  Beer - Great Variety, Good Value, and Great Service (Served by the brewmasters themself) Price - Pretty good but will wait until \"post Oktoberfest) Atmosphere - Very neat.   a little courtyard, inside was nice / very German feel  Overall - a great place to check out.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Having been to Penn Brewery a few times lately and them having a groupon available, I invited 2 couples out for dinner.    Firstly, they sat us directly next to a band making it impossible to hear each other and the waitress.   Second, although the food was mostly as good as before, the portions were much smaller than what we've had in the past with the same prices.  This was a big let down.  Lastly, we had 3 couples, 3 separate checks and they would only let us use 1 groupon for the entire table.  I understand this is in the fine print but this is the only reason we came even came here to eat.  Never experienced this problem before with groupons.  Now we have to come back to use them, I'm sure that will be the last time."}
{"text":"Great place to go for food and beer. Their beers are hit and miss, but the food is always great. Appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and meals are all awesome. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"I used to LOVE the Penn Brewery.  My dad had his 50th birthday there, i had my 30th birthday there, the food was great, the music was great, and dont even get me started  about the time i accidentally drank an entire gallon of beer at Oktoberfest bc they were serving the beer in half gallon jugs and after you drink half a gallon of beer, it seems like a good idea to have another!  (I had a DD).  Its under new management and only the location is still the same.  And the beer.  So I might be back for Oktober fest only, this time sticking to half a half a gallon.    How changed is my beloved German restaurant?  Four words.  Dave Matthews Cover Band.  WTF.    If I ever come back for food, it wont be on a Saturday night.  Because of nostalgia I've tried this place three times, but due to my schedule its unfortunately been on a Saturday night which is apparently \"Bands that sound like your sitting in a dorm room listening to your crush play guitar and sing but he cant sing and hes just learning guitar but you prentend to like it anyway\" night.  Who the hell is their booker?  Why is it SO DAMN LOUD in the bar I couldn't talk to my friend, instead we kind of sat there and watched the beer ripple in our glasses.  The accoustics are equally bad upstairs and downstairs.  Its terrible.  If you must keep the same music booker, can you PLEASE have your bands turn the volume down, just a little.  And for the record, I love music.  But it's quieter at Stage AE.  its just assinine.    Since youre not going to be able to HEAR or TALK to your dining companions, you can look forward to the food which is just slightly better than ok.  The schnitzel is pretty good, but I dont know why this restaurant even tries to maintain that they are a german restaurant.  Why not just become a brew pub, and have a menu with really good bar food?  This place is a disappointment.  But theres really good beer here, and that makes it worth it to check it out one lsat time before realizing its just never going to be the same restaurant it once was."}
{"text":"It was pretty dead and uneventful for a Friday night. The pretzels were way too salty. I enjoyed the Weizen to wash down all that salt. The beer itself is way better than the atmosphere and experience at the brewpub. There's really no reason to come here. Youre better off going to a bar elsewhere with their beers on tap, or just buying six packs and cases"}
{"text":"Initial impression is not good....wanted to sit at the bar....only a few open seats behind the overly large taps that obstruct the view of the beer selection board and the tv.....the manager firmly planted himself and his laptop at the end of the bar taking an available seat away from us.  He sat there the whole time....he should have gone someplace else to do his work.  This all happened before we had one beer...on a good note the beer was good....the initial impression left a bad taste in our mouth."}
{"text":"this is a great sammie and beer spot located on the Northside of this beautiful city! what a view you see look across the street This evening we really were starvin marvins we were craving big Sammies  we were seated a  two person high top big windows look in upon the brewery they also have big picnic table style seating for large groups or folks who like to be friendly big tvs a bar and its a great spot we started off with pretzels they came with three dips mustard, cheese and cheese blend that was like a cold butter consistency but really yummy I asked for a reuben with no corned beef...yup thats my veggie sammie  this place place did a good job with the marbled rye from breadworks (another fine Pittsburgh place to go get BREAD of all sorts) fries were ok  spatzle side was ok a bit greasy but very tasty nice selection of beers I tasted nut roll ale is was nice  I wanted to try their strudel but was so full maybe next time our waitress was right on and very friendly 50 bucks was reasonable I will return"}
{"text":"Great service, beer, food & tour!   I had the 10 beer sampler.  Our waitress here, Dawn brought out a couple of additional tastes...personal favorites of hers and other staff. NICE!  We tried the basket: pretzels, beer cheese, beer battered chicken strips and honey mustard dip.  that fed two of us just fine!  Then Dawn introduced us to Dave who I believe to be a brewer.  Dave gave us a quick tour of the place and broke down some history of the establishment and the hill it sits on.  He was great.  He can read the bewilderment on your face and dumb the tour down or kick it up to geek level and answer technical questions from beer nerds or the weekend afficionado.  Best PIT-stop yet on my weekend visit to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"First stop from the airport was Penn Brewery. My bestie McGee is a big brewpub fan, and he had been planning to bring me here since he discovered it upon his moving to the North Side.  It's a great place! Any spot where you can saddle up to the bar and strike up a conversation with locals, get to know the story behind the place, sample some local specialties- the appeal factor for me is unforgettable. The staff were a friendly bunch, all happy to share suggestions and let me sample some seasonal offerings. The food did not disappoint either. We had Pierogis (Polish dumplings) and Potato Pancake to share. Pierogis are not a typical West Coast specialty, so in my humble opinion, all I can say is they were good, and went well with the beer.  I'd say this place is good for an out of towner looking for some direction on what local brews are worth your time. Even though we sampled some smaller bits from the menu, I'd also venture to say the mains are probably worth a shot too.  I am sure I'll be back at the Penn Brewery just as soon as I breeze back through my favorite drinking city on the map."}
{"text":"Lived in Pittsburgh all my life can't believe this was my first time here.  There German style food is outrageous good.  I had the sausage platter with sour kraut and some kind of German potatoes.  All the sausages were very good dipped in a little mustard, sour kraut amazing!!!!  The potatoes were bad but I didn't care cause the rest of the plate was so stellar.  The spätzle with mushroom sauce was also outstanding with grill chicken.  There Pilsner beers are ok and I really likes the wiezen.  Can't wait to go back though for the food!!  Prices are a little steep but not bad."}
{"text":"Love their Oktoberfest and Penn Dark, unfortunately service wasn't the best and the Pittsburgh salad was just ok.  Should have known their french fries wouldn't have been up to par considering it's a German Restaurant.  The pretzels were amazing though.  A few years back I went for Oktoberfest and a brewery tour. Great tour, great band, and of course, great beer!"}
{"text":"I've given this place 3 tries. Each time hoping that I'm going to like it as the outside space and ambiance tells me I should. I just can't get past the mediocre food and choices of beer.   I've said before I'm not a beer drinker. But I usually find something, except here.   This was another stop on the brew tour I took my brother on while he visited. Even he, as a beer lover, didn't even want to try anything that was offered.  That's all for me. I won't try again."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Penn Brewery since I moved to Pittsburgh.  I've heard good things about both the food and the service.  I finally made it there last weekend and was pleased with my visit.  I initially tried to visit last weekend, but it was so packed there was over an hour wait for a table, so we decided to return in the future but with reservations.  I was glad I had made them because even fairly early they were crowded.    They have happy hour specials from 5-7 which include half price appetizers and beer and drink specials.  Because of the specials, we tried the Buffalo chicken pierogies, potato pancakes and the beer cheese.  All were fantastic!  Being from Buffalo, I was especially excited to try the Buffalo Chicken pierogies since I've never had anything like them before.  My only complaint is that they were slightly dry, but the flavor was fantastic.  Entrees were the weinerschnitzel and sausage platter.  Both were very tasty, however my schnitzel was a bit dry (remedied by eating it with bites of the cabbage).  I was going to order it with the sauce, but the server advised it is bitter and almost no one likes it.  I'm glad he gave me the tip, but if no one likes it, you would think they would change the recipe to improve that aspect.  Oh well.  Service was good.  Almost too good in that all of our food came out very quickly.  We had other places to be that evening, so in the scheme of things, it wasn't a bad thing, but to some degree, we almost felt rushed.  Beer was amazing.  Had the nut roll ale and the Christmas blend.  I wish I would have bought some to take home with me.  There will be a return visit."}
{"text":"The night before we went here I had a Penn Dark at a bar.  It was very good, but I rarely drink dark beer.  That being said I was very excited to go to the brewery and have some good German food and beer.  We were seated very quickly and the waitress was nice, but said a guy who was busy would be our waiter....seems that didn't happen as she came right back to take our order.  We order a brezel (Pretzel with beer cheese), and I got a schnitzel sandwich and a Penn lager.  The food came before the appetizer.....guess she was busy too.  The brezel and schnitzel sandwich were fantastic.  The food here is top notch and in my opinion saves this place.  My lager however was awful.  So bitter, I barely got through it.  I decided to get the Octoberfest beer a shot as I tried my girlfriends Penn Gold and thought OK, not great.  The Octoberfest was better, but still awfully bitter and just not very tasty.  I'd go back for the food, but Hofbrau definitely has them on the beer."}
{"text":"Was in Pittsburgh last week to see family and catch a couple of Pirate games.  A friend recommended the Penn Brewery.  What a great place. Food, beer, service and atmosphere all are an A Plus!!  First night had a dinner with four of my family members at a large communal table.  Had a meat and cheese platter as an app and the Sauerbraten as my entree.  Both delicious and I paired it with a Penn Weizen and two Berliner Weiss (my favorite style).  We all had a great time and as I left filled a growler of Berliner to go.  Next day I returned to refill said growler and have a couple of apps.  Pretzel and stuffed peppers.  Both unreal.  Marie or Maria (sorry) was bartender, she could not have been nicer and even went so far as to ask the brewmaster a couple of questions for me.  Had a nice conversation both nights with a guy named Warren and felt like I was in my local corner bar the whole time.  I look forward to returning and was sorry I missed the Maerzen!! thanks for making our trip so fun!"}
{"text":"My husband I and have been twice. The food is great, prices reasonable especially given the generous portions, and the service prompt if uninspired. Small high-topped tables at the bar, otherwise all tables are long German Hofbrauhaus style. There's seating upstairs and in the basement, which doesn't feel basement-y but can be a bit lonely. Once the live music starts, watch out. It's KILLER loud. Located in a bit of a black hole on the near Northside, but plenty of parking and doesn't feel unsafe. Recommended."}
{"text":"I had a German meal and it was very good.  The beer choices were limited to 5 draft brews and some bottled beer.  The beer was okay not outstanding.  They need to create small experimental beers to bring some excitement to an otherwise un-interesting beer selection.  No Oktoberfest or pumpkin beers.  The service was unequal.  Prompt attention upon arrival on a slow Thursday night.  The waiter disappeared when I wanted to pay.  He mumbled something about having to run some cases.  Other waiters ignored me even though I was standing right by the bar and register. I will not return to this place, there are too many other better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Beer, Beer, and yes more Beer!! So me and my boyfriend were heading out to a local place for wings but we ended up getting side tracked to this little Brewery! I've heard on Penn Brewery but never had the chance to get there until now. I absolutely feel I love with the decor and the quaint brick building. The out door area with the brick road was super cute and gave it an European feel. It was obviously to cold to sit outside but would love to check it out when it's in full glory mode.  After we got inside and seated I checked out the beer menu. I loved how they had their own selection of beers. I was a bit disappointed That the beer I was told to try was out of stock so I ended up going with the Penn Dark which was so delicious I ended up drinking two of them  As for food I ordered the wild mushroom flat bread and the butcher plate for 2-3 people. Now don't get me wrong the mushroom flat bread was good but I was disappointed there were so few actual mushrooms on it. The butcher plate was excellent I lived all the different meats but you only got 2 kinds of cheese which I wish I had at least one more to try.  My boyfriend got the beef and lamb Doner Kebab that I didn't try but he raved that the lamb was especially tasty.  As for our server she was nice but when she reviewed our beer menu she went over which ones they had on tap and which ones were not which was great. Then I forgot which ones she didn't have an asked about a certain one that was not on tap and she got a bit annoyed and snippy with me. I was taken a bit back from but other then that our service was good."}
{"text":"I forget what kind of beer I had, but it was potent and really good. I loved Darren's pierogis and chili. The beer cheese is addictive. My entree, the Rouladen, was a tender, moist winner of a meal and was served in a generous portion. Stupid me had the other half boxed up and then forgot it! Our server was really, sweet, fun, and talked our ears off."}
{"text":"Penn Brewery HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!  Authentic German Bier + GREAT food, especially during October Fest!   Their Sour Weis beer is awesome as are their Pretzel app!"}
{"text":"I love the food and the beer. If they made it more warm as far as atmosphere this place would be crowned every night. That said we had the Jaugersnitzel and it is amazing.  As for the beer we get flights then you don't have to decide."}
{"text":"Food: 2 stars.  Beer: 4 stars.  Service: 3.5 stars.  As an East-Ender I must admit I rarely venture to the North or South Side.  And while I've had many a Penn Brew, I've never made it to their restaurant until last night.  In one word: underwhelmed.  While the building, outdoor seating, and general ambiance were exactly what we were looking for, the food was a huge disappointment.  We were actually pretty excited looking at the menu before we left, but little did we know...   In ordering the Vegetarian Smoked Bratwurst our server all but refused to bring it for me.  He declared it \"nasty\" and that 50-60% of those ordered end up going back to the kitchen and commenced to try to sell me a garden burger or veggie panini.  I finally gave in and ordered the Pierogi Platter hoping to get something else vegetarian to share with my partner.  I wish I would have ordered the bratwurst.  At first, I was enthused by the serving size but little did I know... what laid before me were 6 dry fish pierogies with a dismissive pile of cold caramelized onions.  I should have sent it back at first bite, but second guessed my own reading of the menu.  When the second pierogi was potato, I decided just to eat them only to find the last 4 to also to be the dry cold fish stuffing.  I didn't eat the last two, we were on a tight schedule and I'm generally too polite to send a mistake like this back.  My partner had the kasespaetzle and while decent, didn't seem true to the spaetzle I've had many times in southern germany.  That said, the beer was quite lovely.  I had the Weizen and my partner the summer berry weizen.  Both well carbonated, flavorful and quite refreshing.  General menu overview: 5-6 apps from $5-8.  A few salads, 6-8 entrees from $9-20 a few sandwiches and a few desserts."}
{"text":"If you want a good German meal- seek no more. This is it.   Absolutely superb.    The spaetzle is the best I've ever had. I've been to other German restaurants in the burgh and this puts them to shame!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite brewery in Pittsburgh. Their year-round beer selection is tasty, and seasonal beers are even better. (Don't pass up the Nut Roll Ale in wintertime.)  I tried a Moscow Mule with their housemade Hot Ginger beer.  It was average; not much flavor.  I'll stick with their beer in the future.   What really makes Penn Brew stick out is their fantastic food menu.  I dreamt about their Pierogis my entire drive from Cincinnati.  Do NOT pass these up. We also tried the pretzel sticks and BBQ chicken flatbread this time as well; I would get both again.  The pretzel sticks are served with three unique dips, all German and made in house.  The cheese dip is to die for.     For whatever reason, their menu is loaded with vegetarian option.  If that is your preferred diet, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Before writing this review, I have to admit, I only went once and I didn't order a full meal.  However, I did drink a lot of beer and I watched my friends eat and it looked fantastic!  So, the thing I can talk about: the beer. DEE-lish! But, really, were we expecting anything less? I hear this place has a great Oktoberfest celebration (at the end of September mind you) and I'm going to have to make a special trip back for that. The Weisen is pretty fantastic, I totally recommend that.  Then there was the food. The happy hour special was half off apps, so that's what I got. Unfortunately I was not a fan. I'm not sure if it's because I didn't really want an app (I wanted food food) but I got it anyway cause it was on special (I'm always looking for a deal - in fact, I might have to change my nickname here to that!). So I got the chicken tenders and pretzels with beer cheese and honey mustard. None of it was really appetizing. Mainly, I can't eat the pretzels but I had a small bite and it tasted pretty awesome. If I could eat bread, I'd probably just have gotten that.  I should have gotten the pierogies. My friend got the dessert - pumpkin pierogies (seasonal only) - and I had a taste...omfg. DEE-lish! Topped with whipped cream and toasted nuts. If you're around and they have it, save room. oh. I think I just drooled on myself a little...  I took a quick trip to the restrooms (I mean, I was drinking a lot!) and I saw other tables' food orders and it all looked good. I will definitely be going back again (not just because there's a cute boy that lives within walking distance!) but because I HAVE to go try their food."}
{"text":"Spaetzle! Spaetzle! Spaetzle!   Okay, so they have other good food and beer. But I just really like their spaetzle. It's almost as good as Max's Allegheny Tavern.   The atmosphere here is really fun, and they often have live music. The tables are set up family-style, so get used to being close to your dinner guests. While you eat, enjoy checking out the brewery (indoors) or the fun courtyard (outside).   Sadly, they've recently removed a couple of my favorite menu items, and while there's always room in my heart for spaetzle, that's now just about the only thing I *love* - the rest is just okay."}
{"text":"I'm giving Penn Brewery a solid four stars. Stopped in for dinner and a beer and I wasn't disappointed.   We started off with the cheese and brews. We decided to go with the five cheese and five beer sampler. The cheese is really good! Everyone had an opinion on which beer was the best ( I said the penn weizen) so I'll let you decide which is the best choice. I had the bier cheese and macaroni for the main entree. It was delicious. I added the sausage to it and I'm glad I did because it was good. My wife had the rabbit and she liked it, but said she would probably try something different next time.  The beer was cold and the food was good. The service was quick and friendly. The inside setup is kind of odd but I guess it works. The stairs were roped off and you had to use the elevator to go downstairs to use the bathroom. Not a big deal, just odd because it's usually the other way around.   Anyways, I had a good experience here and will be back again. Most certainly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here with a coworker and let me say I love the look of the place- has a beautiful courtyard and the inside definitely sells an old look but is pleasing to look at.   The inside was clean and the waiters/tenders were attentive. Drinks are very good, I tried multiple and do not think there was one I would not drink again- absolutely delicious.   Food was pretty good- the pretzel was tasty- a little salty but I enjoyed it still- most people love the salt- I go easy on it. The cheese dip was perfect though- the kind that makes you close your eyes and savor the moment when you bite into it.   I got the cheesesteak- it was okay, nothing to brag about, but was decent.   I will definitely come back. But the highlight of this place is the liquids not the solids."}
{"text":"On a Sunday night, this place was pretty empty. That's fine; I was there for the food and beer.   I ordered the beef kielbasa wurst baguette with hot German potato salad. The kielbasa was hot and juicy. The skin had a good texture, but was sometimes a bit tough to bite through. The kraut was a bit bland on its own. Mustard had a good spice. The German potato salad is in a thick glaze that is quite sweet. When I scraped off half the glaze, it was pretty good.   The Penn IPA was pretty mild, not too hoppy or bitter like I expect. The Cheater Juice was more what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Great German food options....so it's not Hofbrauhaus or Church Breworks.  It's a Pittsburgh institution and the beer is great, awesome selection of pierogis and German food.    Additionally live music options, even during the week are fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is, easily, one of the best brewpubs in the country. You can probably find better beer elsewhere, and you can certainly find more selection and more interesting beers elsewhere (even in Pittsburgh), but the collection of good food, great beer, great atmosphere and a really venerable history. Sit out on the patio, drink a pilsner and eat some sausage. I don't know that there's a better way to spend an evening in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"We were here most recently for the Yelp party, so keep in mind that a place that is giving you free food and beer almost always wins.  It's an excellent business model to get good reviews, but quite awful if you have any interest in making money.  However, I have been here before, and it's really cool in just about every way.  The coolest being was that it was an actual Civil War era brewery apparently, and has a bunch of secret catacombs that they used to store ingredients, and quite possibly, dead bodies.  You can schedule a little mini-tour of the brewery, which is pretty cool as well.  The food is good to very good, and the beer is really awesome.    The only bad thing is parking.  There is an attached garage, so if you make it in there, you're safe.  If you don't there's a terrible unpaved, unmarked lot that takes you across a street that has a blind curve and cars driving a million miles an hour.  I lost many frogs trying to get across that road, and my heart aches for each of my dead friends.  But we did make it across eventually and had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"I ate here for dinner this past Thursday night with a dining companion.  The decor of the restaurant makes it look like a beer hall from Germany with long benches and tables.  You are also able to see a fermentation tank which is nice since you are at a brewery.  For dinner my dining companion and I started off by sharing the Buffalo Chicken Pierogi appetizer.  I was excited about them and they did not disappoint with every part being very good, especially the chicken filling.  For my entree I ordered a beef roll that came with braised red cabbage and German potato salad.  The potato salad ended up being the best part of the meal for me with the beef roll being average and the red cabbage disappointing.  The reason for this being that it had a very strong tasting spice that I could not completely identify (caraway maybe?) which I have never had in red cabbage before.  So in the end the pierogi appetizer stole the show for myself.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here again.  There were plenty of items on the menu that I would like to try and the appetizer was good enough that they still intrigue me."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed stopping by Penn Brewery for beers last Friday afternoon before heading to the Wigle Whiskey Garden and Barrelhouse. I appreciated the small parking lot adjacent to the brewery that made finding a spot much easier than trolling the narrow north side streets. I ordered a Ginger Beer and a few pierogies, which were both very tasty. Though the interior of Penn Brewery was nice, I really enjoyed sitting outside. Even though it was pretty warm in the sun, it was the perfect temperature in their shaded courtyard. I could have relaxed here for hours. I would definitely like to come back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"This was our first stop off the plane. The beer was really good, Penn Dark, and the food was just as amazing, German Ruben. The bartender was amazing and showed up helpful. The manager/GM was also in site and shot the shot with us. I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Given the mixed reviews, I wasn't quite sure to what to expect when I came here recently. And fittingly, I'd say my experience was mixed, although overall positive.  We went on a Saturday evening, and I thought the place would be hopping, but it was sort of dead. The space is beautiful though, and it was a shame that their charming courtyard beer garden was not being patronized by more people that evening. We were seated indoors in their downstairs area, which was cozy, but a bit dark and dungeon-like. The evening started off on an annoying note when it took about 15 minutes for a waiter to come by and take our drink order (though he was more attentive after that).  Our waiter was hilariously blunt. Several times when we tried to order something, he shot us down with his unsolicited (though actually appreciated) opinion:  Us: \"We'll try the mussels to start.\" Waiter (with horrifying look): \"No, you don't want to order those. They are really sandy.\" Us: \"Umm, ok, thanks for the heads up. How about the peanut butter and jelly wings?\" Waiter (gives knowing glance): \"How do you THINK wings with peanut butter and jelly would taste? Don't get those.\"  Later for our meal order:  Friend: \"I'll have the rabbit for dinner.\" Waiter (same horrifying look as before): \"No, no good. Literally ANYTHING else would be a better choice.\"  Though it was a bit odd, we did appreciate his candor about the food and I know he was just trying to be helpful. Also it gave us plenty to giggle about every time he left the table.  Anyway, speaking of the food, waiter man's tips were fairly solid, because we were pleased with almost everything we ordered. To start, we sampled the Black BBQ wings, which were meaty, juicy, and crispy. We also tried the pierogies, which were good, though nothing noteworthy (I can think of about a dozen places off of the top of my head that serve a better pierogie). On the annoying side, they only gave 3 pierogies in the appetizer serving, which for $7 bucks seems a little stingy. Also, 3 is an odd number of anything for an appetizer, as most dining parties are 2 or 4 people (ours was 4). Thanks for creating an awkward sharing situation, Penn Brewery. Anyhow, we also tried the pretzel and bier cheese, which everyone at the table liked except for yours truly (I found the stiff mousse-y texture of the cheese to be unappetizing).  For our meal, my husband and I split the chicken kasespaetzle, which appears to be Germany's answer to mac n' cheese. It was really tasty, with a rich, creamy, tangy and flavorful sauce, plenty of juicy chicken, and tender pasta dumplings. Our friends split the roasted pork, which they reported to be delicious as well. Entree portions were generous and more than enough for us to split and still feel full and happy (especially given the appetizers we had). For dessert, we shared the apple strudel, and our waiter was quite pleased.  \"GREAT choice, that's the best dessert we have!\" he exclaimed a little too enthusiastically after we ordered it.   Thanks, waiter, glad we finally could nail it on the first try. And nail it we did -- the strudel was heavenly. Flaky pastry crust and warm, soft apple filling paired with melty vanilla ice cream was the perfect way to end our meal. Very good experience overall. Or should I say, \"sehr gut\" experience overall."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening. Was sat in the back corner. Took 15 minutes for a waitress to welcome us and offer drinks. Waited and waited. Took food order. Order arrived wrong which she corrected but took forever to cook. The waitress was horrible but pleasant person. I know it gets busy but felt misplaced because there wasn't any focus. Food was good and customer service is very important. My advise is a hit or miss place. Most likely won't go back."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have ever had at a brewery or winery. Sat down at a table for 3 in the bar area. 3pm on 12/26. Half-empty. After 7 minutes and not being helped, despite 3 servers + a bartender, I walked to the bar and asked the bartender if we could order from him or if someone was coming to the table. He said someone would be there in a minute. 5 minutes later, timed btw, not one person came up to us, yet checked on various tables to see if people who already had placed orders or had food were ok. The bartender knew we were waiting, saw multiple servers come up to the bar, and said nothing. Sorry, but 12 minutes to wait for sometime to come by a table for a couple of beers is absolutely ridiculous. As we walked out, we passed one of the servers who didn't even acknowledge us, even though she had seen us waiting there. This place should be ashamed of its unbelievably poor customer service. Truly appalling. Have a great beer somewhere at the strip and skip this brewery."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breweries we have been at.  The beers were great tasting, and the food was spectacular!!!!  Couldn't beat the location.  Service was terrific!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a very big fan of the atmosphere, the history that this place has, and the beer, however I am not a big fan of the food. Everything came out very greasy, my fiance ordered the steak salad medium well done but this most recent time, it came out chewy and well under cooked, it was sent back and remade....came out just as chewy.  Other than that, the food is usually very good especially their German entrees and sandwiches.   Side Note: If you have every been here before and seen the 3 person bar....yeah that is not a nice horseshoe bar with ample seating."}
{"text":"Good beer. Didn't eat anything but enjoyed our visit. Be warned though, if you order the \"full flight\" your going to be there a while."}
{"text":"This review is purely based on a trip to the brewery and the beer. No food was had.  We sat outside and wanted to order a flight but were told we would have to go inside for that. Okay...then I'll just have beer XYZ please. Sorry, we don't serve that beer outside.  Alrighty then, I guess our plan to sit outside on a nice day isn't happening.  So we end up inside sitting at a long table and ordered the flight. It was brought out with no explanation. Most places explain the beers or at least tell you which are which. We had to flag down the waitress to ask her and she stumbled through a little unsure of herself. I think she was wrong on a few of them. Regardless all but the seasonal beer on the flight was flavorless and tasted watered down. The 3 of us in the party all agreed that this was the most disappointing stop on our brewery tour that day. There are much, much better choices around Pittsburgh for my tastes.  That coupled with lackluster service and silly rules for sitting outside pretty much assures that I won't be returning to try the food. 2 stars because the brewery itself looks nice and they do have a nice outdoor area. Apparently we just couldn't use it."}
{"text":"The outside looked a bit shady where you had to enter in from some side entrance between the building and the next... The service was amazing - the waiter was fantastic and brought out our food in great fashion.  The food on the other hand was just....okay. It didn't blow me away then again I ordered vegetarian at a German restaurant. Go figure.  The Pierogies weren't anything special - just regular potato.  The pretzels themselves weren't that spectacular either, the thing that made them was the cheese which had a thicker consistency similar to Velveeta... All in all I wouldn't give my left arm to come here again."}
{"text":"Great beer and the outside area is hopping in the Summertime. Good beer and my sandwich (burger, pulled pork, and french fried onions) were probably the highest caloric intake of 2008. Its a bit out of the way from the action in Pittsburgh so be prepared to wait a while for a cab if you call late."}
{"text":"Great beer with seasonal selections and authentic German food (my favorite is the schnitzel) with portions big enough to share."}
{"text":"I had someone take this place up big time. I thought it was a cute little spot but I wouldn't make a special trip for it. Now granted I didn't try their food so I may be delicious for all I know. The scenery is cool because you can see them brewing the beers behind a huge glass wall. It's a cozy place and if I'm in the area I would go here again but make it a point to try the food. They do have a full bar if you aren't in the mood for beer. The beer is refreshing and I also tried a margarita which was very good. Oh and btw you can park out front despite what the sign says."}
{"text":"We went for Octoberfest.  I don't know what I was expecting, but it was white tents and aluminum serving trays for brats and wursts.  Sauerkraut was sweet, but good and hubby said it was how his mom made it!  Now I know!  Having it on different levels I guess is a challenge, but really it was people sitting around drinking and talking.  There was a band (wearing their Steelers gear!), but all in all kind of boring.  We were there around 5-ish so I'm sure later in the evening it would get more raucous, but again, with the different levels you kind of lose the \"fest\" part of it and there wasn't any sort of decorations or banners or anything.  Even the people working were just in jeans and t-shirts.  I looked inside at their menu, which looked good and filling, but the decor of the restaurant wasn't anything that would make me eat inside.  The beer was ok, nothing special.  The Penn Gold was meh, the Penn Dark was meh."}
{"text":"What a nice night at the brewery! We sat outside and drank classic German beers and had a great dinner.  The last time we were there, we weren't as impressed with the food, so we've stayed away for a while. Maybe it was a different cook, but last night the food was fantastic.  I'm a huge fan of jaegerschnitzel and spaetzle, and it was cooked very well here.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My partner and I are big brewery fans, but had never been to Penn Brewery.  I give it props for being one of the more \"OG\" breweries before being a craft beer was hip.  Unfortunately, some of the newer breweries are better and more unique.   I found the beers to be ok.  We sampled a few and I settled on the tangerine swirl.  The taste was light and very drinkable, but I could barely taste the tangerine.  My parter got the ginger beer, which was pretty good.  Not too spicy and didn't have that sting that some ginger beers give off.  We got the pretzels to try and they were DELISH.  I wish I had more things to dip in the cheese spread thing (forget what it was called but it had cream cheese and a hint of spice and was )   I would come back with friends, it's just not at the top of my list of breweries."}
{"text":"Great place awesome in summer time with outdoor open. Good food. Great beer. Awesome ocktoberfest!"}
{"text":"I love beer and I really love the selection of beer at Penn Brewery. I've sampled the food from here and as a vegetarian, I give it a thumbs up. Not too many places care to have more than one vegetarian option but PB does. As for the beer, each selection is flavorful and unique. Any time my parents throw a party (in Philly) we take a few cases of Penn Brewery beer and it is always a hit.  The place itself is really really big and not only is it a fun drinking spot for a group of friends but families are also comfortable and welcome."}
{"text":"I love Penn Brewery! If you are a lover of German foods and beers then you will love it too! The brewery is in a cool historic building filled with long wooden tables and a window where you can see the beer being made. Totally great photo op right when you get there with the old light up sign outside! I highly recommend getting the butcher plate appetizer, it's a little pricey but totally worth it.  My other food recommendations are the potato pancakes and pierogies! Just order them, you will not be sorry.  As for drinks, I love the Penn Weizen but if you're not sure what to get or want to try a bunch get the sampler! With the beer sampler they give you really good size pours and it's a pretty good price.  Also if you are considering trying Penn Brewery, always check Groupon first!  I was able to get a really good deal on their amazing food with a Groupon. Penn Brewery is a great place to stop for apps, dinner, drinks or all 3!"}
{"text":"Great local brewery.  This year's Oktoberfest brew is top notch!"}
{"text":"TLDR - Ok food/beer, God awful service.   We went to Penn Brewery after a hike on a nice warm day. We reached there at around 2:45 PM. It wasn't overly busy. Nobody received us, nobody seated us, the wait staff looked visibly annoyed but finally after 10-15 mins or roaming around aimlessly they got us seats. We were a group of 12 or so. I would think any restaurant would be happy to have our patronage at a time when the wait and kitchen staff had some slack.   Anyway, it took them over 30 mins to serve us water and even collect our orders. They were atleast 3 parties that came in after us and were served way before our orders came out. These people were done eating and were paying their bills before our food even came out! Our food came out 50 mins after we placed the order! Our food came out at 4:25PM when we walked in the door just around 2:45 on a lazy Sunday afternoon!! Our waitress gave us all kinds of attitude and wasn't apologetic in the least! The food was served at room temperature and was mediocre at best. Nothing anyone couldn't whip up on a George Foreman grill with some store bought sausages.   This was unequivocally the single worst restaurant experience I have had in Pittsburgh. The worst!  Give your business to people who appreciate it and take pride in putting out good quality product/service. Penn Brewery clearly doesn't."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a German bierhalle with good beer & solid food, this is your spot. Large tables with big wooden benches & equally big servings of food & beer. I grew up in Germany, & the food was definitely true to style. Not necessarily the best German food I've had in the States, but still very good--& reasonably priced.  All of the brews were good, but the dark, malty doppelbock--St Nik, I think--was delicious. The beer bumped it up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Oktoberfest! Got pumpkin roll and a Belgium Wheat. Great service and friendly environment!"}
{"text":"This is a very cool craft brewery located in a restored, old industrial building.  The beers were all good and the staff was very friendly.  They serve food too, although we only had beers."}
{"text":"Being a beer lover, I had to try this place on a recent visit to Pittsburgh.  The restaurant is German themed, with a large beer garden where you eat at communal picnic tables. There is also an indoor area that is much less charming.  If you are reserving a table, be sure to specify if you want the beer garden.  On the night of our visit there was a German accordion band playing, which provided a lot of (kind of corny) entertainment though it was a bit loud. The band obviously has a few fans who come regularly wearing their t shirts and at times get up to dance to the music.  The beer was good, I especially liked the Penn Weizen.  We tried a few others that were ok but not memorable.  As to the food, the fresh pretzel with beer cheese was a good starter. For the entrees I would recommend the Polish Hill Plate, which came with kielbasa, perogies and sauerkraut. This item was  far better than the breaded pork schnitzel which I found to be greasy and too large a portion of meat. The sides of applesauce and red cabbage were only so so.  Overall, a fun evening, I think that one visit will be enough, but we enjoyed it for what it was."}
{"text":"I came here for the Oktoberfest festivities, so I'm not sure if my experience is representative of what can usually be expected at Penn Brewery. Regardless, I had a great time. There was traditional German music, beer (being served in cups and half gallon containers), and food. There was a very wide age range, but everyone was respectful of each other (even with all of the alcohol that was being consumed).   My favorite part of Penn Brewery was the outdoor rooftop patio overlooking the downtown skyline. The ambiance on the reminded me of some of the rooftop bars in New York City."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!  So disappointed and will never waste my time going back. How are you a brewery but are out of all your beers?  Not only are you out of beers but half the menu was unavailable. The only thing available were frozen veggie burgers and really thin fried pork. Service was pretty bad too. I'll just stop there. Good luck to those who choose to go!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  The beer is excellent and the food is great.  It's a little loud- I was there on a Saturday night- but the vibe is casual and comfy.  Get something with the bier cheese.  Yum!"}
{"text":"We were very excited for our first trip to Penn Brewery! Our server was helpful, informative, and attentive! The beers were great and the food was amazing! The atmosphere was up beat and we even had football to watch! I will be back when I'm in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and enjoy a good meal BEFORE you arrive. The restaurant is lovely. Great lighting - loads of warm wood. The staff s super friendly and nice. The beers are fantastic. but the food? pretty awful.   My husband opted for the steak frites - the fries were excellent but the steak? greasy and about as flavorful and tender as chewing on an old leather shoe. I ordered the Sauerbraten with kraut and german potato salad. what arrived was two slabs of hard, grey meat that lacked any flavor (hello? season your food, please) and was dry and tough. i was so hungry that i forced down half of it but just could not manage to talk myself into choking down the other piece. The potato salad was pretty good but the kraut was awful - no flavor. ugh. the plate was a mess.   at the end of the meal we were comped dessert due to table shuffling and big parties arriving etc... the chocolate raspberry cake was excellent, I suspect brought in and they make a good cup of coffee.   All in all, come for the beer but pack a sandwich. I would be hard pressed to every find myself inside Penn Brewery otherwise."}
{"text":"I don't know why I haven't visited in all these years - but in the matter of a week I ended up at Penn Brewery twice.   High points: Beer samplers are always great - and with the variety of selection at Penn Brewery, there was plenty to pick from and it was great sharing size. We had the poutine, which was delicious - it was huge though! Way too much for an app for 2 people, so we kind of wish we had just stopped there. We also had the mac & cheese (mostly saved it for left overs) because I really wanted to try their dessert menu.   The location is great - there is a parking garage just up the street that holds a decent amount of vehicles and there is a small amount of street parking near by. There are several picnic style tables, making it a good location for a group - as long as you get there at the right time.  The second visit was just for a beer and some pretzels. We were able to get a 4-top table much earlier than they originally told us to sit as a group rather than huddle around the bar. Good beer - good pretzels. I'd recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible.  Waitress barely came to our table and was not very friendly. I got bier cheese macaroni and it tasted like nothing but yeast. My boyfriend got a chicken sandwich and the chicken wasn't even seasoned. Got an Oktoberfest beer that tasted very cheap and had no flavor."}
{"text":"If there is one word that comes to mind in thinking of Penn Brewery, it is \"LOUD\".  Even being seated far from the boisterous, large party, my companion and I had to raise our voices to be heard as the acoustics are awful with no carpeting. Do not dine here unless you are willing to deal with a lot of noise. The food is excellent.  Her gyro and my jaegerschnitzel with brown gravy were delicious and the portions ample.  The accompanying french fries and mashed potatoes were top-notch. No bread was brought or offered. I did not realize that my beer sampler was a hefty $17, but for ten decent size glasses, the price was fair.  If one person were to consume all of it, they would likely stagger out of the establishment.  Apple strudel with cinnamon ice cream was the perfect ending.  The meal was $61+ for two plus tip."}
{"text":"The place is very nice. Beer and food are very good, actually I liked their food more that Hofbrahaus. They also have live music. The only problem with the place is the location and that's why it's not that crowded on weekends (some people may actually like this). At 10:30 pm there were only 3 tables and a couple of people at the bar."}
{"text":"Went here as a group of 6 people, all with diff dietary restrictions, and all walked out of that place, satisfied, satiated, and happy.  Food was beyond delicious and reasonably priced. We even walked away with 5 growlers of beer!   My only quips are a. My bf ordered a well done burger, and it was given to him medium, at best b. All the food is well priced, except for mine. I ordered a pirogi dish, and was given 3 pieces, I know it's an app, but for 7.00 I expected more.  Other than that, thank you for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Some really good meals and some were average. Things to Get:  Potato Pancakes (excellent flavor), German Rueben (nice size portion), and Jaegerschnitzel (excellent entree) Things to avoid:  Buffalo Chicken Dip (Bland), Bier Cheese and Macaroni (no flavor), and Schweinebraten.  Also - Finish your beer before you ask for another.  When I asked for a beer, it was immediately poured from a pitcher into my current beer that was not even finished with yet."}
{"text":"Mini beerhall-ish. Had a Wheat and a Dark. Wheat is good, heavy on banana flavor. The Dark is a solid beer, not too heavy. If I was tailgating a Steelers game this would be my beer. That said, HAIL TO THE REDSKINS!"}
{"text":"I was surprised at how much I liked this place. Really great beer! I was so surprised at how great the spicy ginger beer was! And the flatbread and sausages we ordered were out of this world! Will definitely frequent again!"}
{"text":"Penn Brewery's Jaeger schnitzel with a side of spaetzle and red cabbage washed down with either a Penn Dark or their delightful Oktoberfest is one of the best dinners ever invented! If there's an Oompah band playing in the background, that just enhances the experience. Their schweinebraten is quite tasty but the Jaeger has my heart. I've ordered that dish in Germany & Austria and Penn's version compares favorably.   Beer and atmosphere here are really fun & cool. Love the outdoor brick courtyard & I especially enjoy when we get seated in the cellar. It's a more intimate space than upstairs which has more of a beer hall atmosphere. I'm not a huge fan of the communal tables on the 1st floor unless you go there with your own big group. Not as much fun with just 2 people.  Penn Brewery is truly a Pittsburgh institution and fortunately when you find one of their beers you like, you can typically find them at a local distributor. We've bought Oktoberfest nearly year round."}
{"text":"I came here for the deustchtown music fest, and was immediately overwhelmed. It was naturally busy, but there were so many different levels and spaces to access with little direction. The menu was disappointing for a vegetarian so I ended up not eating. The staff inside didn't know where to direct us or just didn't care. I get it, they were busy, but their job is to help us enjoy the space.  Negatives aside, the space itself is great. There are tons of areas to explore and relax with good beer. The sound was also well done, and that impressed me.   I'm not sure I'll be back anytime soon. It's just not my vibe, and it's pretty far out of the way for drinking and chilling. I strongly recommend supporting them by buying their local beer though, because that's the cool thing to do."}
{"text":"I'd rather go here than Hofbräuhaus in winter (I find Hofbräu tolerable only during the summer, where I can sit outside far away from the accordian). The beer is, first of all, fantastic. Secondly, the food is good. It's not great, but it's good. I had the pierogies and those were definitely the highlight. Fresh & covered with buffalo cheese - perfect snack food. I also had fries - also good. The sole disappointment was the Jaegerschnitzel. I thought mine was somewhat uninspiring - not at all up to par with the Hofbräuhaus - although this might be due to the fact that I used to live in Munich and have high standards. My friend had the same thing and loved his. All, in all, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent place to visit when in Pittsburgh! Beautiful place, great service, and an excellent selection of beers."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on a Wednesday night. I didn't drink anything because I wasn't in the mood. But, I'd come back and get something to drink and have an appetizer. We started out with the pretzels and beer cheese. It came out with two large pretzels and a container of the dip. It tasted good and may have been the highlight of my meal. For dinner I ordered the Polish hill plate and my boyfriend ordered the Schnitzel. My order came with three pierogis a kielbasa and some sauerkraut.  Overall my meal was just bland. I wasn't sure if the food was made in house, as there wasn't anything that stuck out as being made on the spot. The pierogis didn't have much flavor and the kielbasa was tasty, but had little flavor unless it was dipped in the spicy mustard.  The Schnitzel was fine. Not bad but not really good. The spatzle was fine. Our waitress was nice, seemed a bit overwhelmed but was constantly refilling drinks and running around. Overall the food was mediocre. I think I'd be disappointed if I'd spent 15 dollars on my meal but thankfully I had a groupon. I'll go back but just for drinks and maybe a pretzel or two."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere...but the German food was just OK.  Much better German restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Sausage platter was good, pretzels & beer cheese were good, but the Jagerschnitzel was horrible.  The Jagerschnitzel was too thick, heavy breading, way over fried, and very little gravy.  This is a great place for beer and bar food, but go elsewhere for authentic German dishes."}
{"text":"The beer is good; the food is terrible (except for the potato pancakes, which were very tasty.). The Buffalo chicken dip tasted like grounded up chicken gizzards and was almost blackened on top from being in the broiler too long. The fish was over-fried, dry and tasteless. The sauerbraten resembled beef stew, not really German sauerbraten. There were six people in our party and every one of them were disappointed. We used to go there years ago when the food was authentic, but now it's just your typical, over-fried bar food. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the beer here is amazing. I frequently come to the Penn Brewery to grab one of their IPA or Ginger beers to enjoy in the outdoor area. Never disappointed. Do note it's not self seating and it's very easy to walk into the biergarten from the street and not be waited on. The food on the other hand, I find lacking. I ordered beer cheese and macaroni \"I'm a huge fan of bier cheese and pretzels\" but when my dish arrived, the cheese was watered down and seriously lacking in taste. For the price and what I knew from the quality of the beer, I was surprised and disappointed in the food. It's also quite loud inside on the weekends."}
{"text":"The ambiance was great, the food was exceptional, and the beer was exactly what you would want from your local brewery.   I enjoyed a Reuben and a New Moon double dunkel.   My server was polite and kind of crass - which I very much enjoyed and only added to the euro-American atmosphere. It did take a few minutes for a host to seat us, so if you're in a hurry this might not be ideal, but if you're looking to take get your time and enjoy the company - this is the place."}
{"text":"What's not to like? Local beer ... GREAT local beer.  Good bar food (I did not have an entree ... I gorged myself on appetizers, shame me later). Service was really good ... unusually good. Started at the bar then moved to a table.  I really cannot complain and you know I do LOVE to complain.  If you live in the Burgh and are not a regular here ... I question your taste."}
{"text":"As a tourist I would say this is a must see if you like drinking in old cool buildings. Go at night, go outside and take a pic by the Heinz factory then eat some food and go home."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh from Milford, Ohio. As a birthday present, I treated my husband to some Pittsburgh brew tour.  The building was unique.   I don't drink beer and wasn't thrilled when I asked for a glass of wine and the waitress giggled.      But as far as hubby and his tasting, he felt the samples were good, the prices were fine.    Would have enjoyed a more personal touch from the staff as far as explaining the place, how the tastings work,......you know, just some personal tidbits."}
{"text":"Excellent schweinhock for the entre served over mashed potatoes with grilled asparagus. We will each have a second meal to take home.Tried the Penn Gold on tap. Also great if you don't care for hoppy beer. They had something to suit all tastes. For dessert I shared the fried raspberry cheesecake with my husband. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Review #911! Call a medic!!! A cop!!!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxk_XrTVLDU  After visiting PB months ago for our lone Yelp Elite Event to date, Kay and I knew we had to return, especially being that today was a payday Friday and that PB is minutes from where I work. .  A gothic courtyard featuring caged crannies that look as if they were designed to hold dragons leads to a staircase entry into the establishment.   There is another way to get inside from the street, but I prefer to go take the cobblestone detour since it's Victorian looking and therefore wickedly cool to me. My heroic, fantastical imagination allows me to conceptualize a moonlit, midnight clash with a ghoul, vampire, or some other such creature of the shadows here.   The interiors are jolly and anything but creepy. People holding frothy, wet mugs of housebrewed mead amidst the brass and copper pipes and tanks from which it flows. Communal, stained, wooden benches and tables are where patrons seat themselves.   I knew I wanted some pierogi, so I pretty much disregarded the rest of the menu and settled on the Pierogi Platter, a hexad of dough parcels containing potatoes and cheese with grilled onions as a sweet garnish.  Our bubbly, talkative server Amanda knows what the score is.  When I asked for sour cream on the side minutes after placing my order, she said, \"Dude, you're covered. Who eats pierogi without sour cream anyway? That's not right.\"  And out they came, quickly. In fact, our appetizer, salads, my chili, and our entrees came out simultaneously, almost overwhelming us. Some people might have found this to be a misstep of service, but I barely minded.   I mean, before I could get impatient, a feast was abruptly placed before me! Good food fast?  You bet your hiphuggers...hipster.  Well, for the most part at least. Everything was comfortably comestible, and that includes my house viniagrette salad, even if the dressing was unduly syrupy but only a touch so.  Our starter was a spreadably splendid wedding between Sharp Cheddar and Cream Cheese that was blessed by Penn Pilsner and overseen by average, dried-out, mall-grade pretzels. I would have rather had the spread, which tasted like a far more intelligent and gourmet kind of spray cheese, on some crackers instead.   A cup of their Penn Pilsner Chili was next on deck. Freshly ground chuck, kidney beans, and black beans made for fine, hearty, tomato-based spoonfuls of sweetly fermented and profoundly satisfying stew.  Hey, I may not drink beer or any other kinds of booze, but if you put it in some excellent food, I'll board the boat to Margaritaville without delay.  Oh, the pierogi; they were peerless. The outer dough was caramelized, took on the flavors of the onions, and contained the most luscious mashed potatoes ever to be served at your favorite aunt's house. As someone whose blood is mostly Polish, I was proud of these paradisiac pierogi and was greatly gladdened that a chef had come up with a proper recipe for them.   Kay had the Rouladen, a fragile, sultry, enlivened, and rolled-up carpet of steak, bacon, onions, and pickles that was coated with a deeply savorous, beer-borne, and cryptic \"brown sauce.\"   Dessert (they only have a Warm Apple Strudel and Chocolate Raspberry Cake on tap) we skipped due to having a surplus of treats at home, but please do not skip Penn Brewery. If a teetotaler like myself had a pleasurable dinner here, you should as well."}
{"text":"In Pitt for the weekend, a buddy recommended I should stop a Penn Brewery. Great, inexpensive beer ~ $3.50 (got the IPA and the Gold). Having never been to Pitt before, the brewery felt like a microcosm of the city; genuine, working class people in a historical, German-rooted neighborhood. Nothing really flashy, just a simple, neat place."}
{"text":"Yummy Sunday evening choice!! My friend and I were looking for somewhere to go..and we were getting hangry! We came in, we're seated promptly, and ordered. They didn't have the pumpkin roll ale I wanted but the server assured me I'd like the nut roll which I did. Out pretzel app was great.. 4 soft pretzel sticks w 3 dipping choices. Lots of salt but just tapped some of it off. Then I had the Rachel which is a lighter version of a Rueben... it was done perfectly on breadworks marble. I had the warm German potato salad.. yummy with a spicy bacon sauce.  We also got a side of spaetzle which was perfect. We will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Do you know what I'm guilty of? It's being out of town and thinking that things are really close and they aren't. At all. I've now made this same mistake in every town and city I've been to and Pittsburgh was no different. We stayed at the William Omni hotel and decided to walk to The Penn Brewery. Google Maps says 1.5 miles so really it didn't seem that bad of a walk -- except there's no real good way to get there. We ended up walking through some park where there was a 5k going on. My husband was smoking and half drunk, while these lovely racers were cheering each other on. Embarrassing or what?  Even despite the really extreme walk in super uncomfortable shoes, I loved Penn Brewery. Maybe I loved it more because I had to walk so far to get there.   Although I like to try new foods, I don't think I've ever had German food, so this was my first dabble in that. I went with the stuffed banana peppers for an entree and the potato pancakes to start. Both were equally delicious and left me wanting to try more of this new culinary treat. However, the stuffed peppers were huge and I really had no room left in my stomach for anything else.  Service was phenomenal until we asked for bus directions. Then no one had any clue and told us to use our phones to get back. Ordinarily that's what we do but both of them happened to be dead. So you know what that means. Another 1.5 mile walk back.   So was it worth the 3 mile walk? Abso-lutely and I'd do it all over again if it meant eating some more of those stuffed peppers."}
{"text":"We came in after spending the day at the Science Center.  Love the courtyard dining area, but we wanted air conditioning and to check out the inside.  We got a monster table all to ourselves.  Nice.  Even nicer was the view of downtown.  BJ got a Penn Wheatson beer.  It was very good, simliar to a Blue Moon or a Hoeggarten.  Since we were feeling a little German, BJ got the pierogi plate and I got käsespätzle.  We liked both our dishes.  My accompanying salad had some brown pieces of lettuce. But I forgave that because our server was kind enough to bring us a sample of the hot German potato salad.  All in all, a pretty decent meal.  But of course, we always going to like any brewery."}
{"text":"This was a great stop. We were visiting Pittsburgh and I wanted to treat my hubby to a brewery trip. His favorite. We were not disappointed. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the place had German food. Yum! We also had a sampler of their beers. Pretty diverse flavors.  We were there on a Saturday afternoon, so it wasn't super crowded. Had a nice casual vibe though. They have a nice patio on the side that must be great on a warm night. They also had a huge party room down on the  first floor.  All around a great stop. I did see that someone mentioned a downtown view. I was excited to see it, but the only downtown view I saw was from inside the elevator. Downtown view not so much. Hit the inclines instead."}
{"text":"A visit to Penn Brewery is a must if you are a beer lover like me.  A choice of 5 or 10 beer flights! I was tempted to try them all out but unfortunately my travel mates are not beer drinkers... (pop/water drinkers).   My beer flight ($10) even includes their Okotober Bier... which is one of my fave out of all!  Sausage Platter ($7.95) with hot German potato salad on the side. The sourness of the salad does need to get use to but it is great to balance the meatiness of the sausages.  My next trip for sure will include a Happy Hour stop here at Penn Brewery! $3 for a Pint and 1/2 off appetizer... that's would be such a sweet deal."}
{"text":"I love restaurants in old buildings, and outdoor seating between the awkward spaces of once was, is always an experience. I felt like I was eating at one of those highly exclusive prison restaurants in Europe. Except I was in Pittsburgh, drinkin' a beer and eatin' some macaroni and cheese a.k.a kase kugle mit speck. I had another side but can't remember what it was. My point is, is that the kase kugle mit speck was just macaroni and cheese. I paid $6.95 for a small macaroni and cheese. At least the Penn Pilsner was worth it, I remember it well. I highly recommend going there for the ambience and beer."}
{"text":"I started coming her monthly, years before moving to Pittsburgh,so it's 20 years I've been eating here.  I bought a Groupon, and treated my daughter to  dinner for a GNO.  I was the designated driver, and ordered water (I don't drink soda).  Janelle, the server, didn't hide her disappointment at no big bar tab. The service she gave us was abysmal, at best. She took our orders, brought us drinks, and the check. A food runner seved us dinners and dessert. The sausage on my sausage platter($18) was barely warm, though my daughter's mac and bier cheese ($14) was piping hot.  My sauerkraut was piping hot,  the German potato salad warm, and both were delicious. The Apfel Strrudel for dessert was barely warm, and dough a bit stiff. It needed more cinnamon, too. I dropped my knife during dinner, and had to hunt someone down for a replacement. Janelle didn't know how to process a Groupon, and 3 people later, I finally got a shift manager who did,and she took dessert off the bill. ($7) She apologized and said she hoped I would return. Even though I told her about my 20 year patronage, and that this was a treat for my daughter, she gave no incentive to return. So, I won't. I may call the GM and give him a chance, to be fair."}
{"text":"I had a groupon that was expiring, so we decided to try out Penn Brewery.  I have heard mixed reviews from friends.  I wanted to give it a try.  This is what we ordered  The bloomfield flatbread pizza- I'm a fan of goat cheese, so i thought this was really good. The buffalo chicken pierogi- This was delicious.  It seems like you can't go anywhere in Pittsburgh with out seeing a buffalo chicken something these days.  This was a pleasant surprise. veggie burger- not the best veggie burger I've had.  It was sort of dry, with chunks of corn and red pepper (i think it was red pepper).  it's not served with mayo, mustard, hummus spread or anything as a condiment for the burger.  The waitress didn't ask, so I assumed it came with something...but for the price, I shouldn't really complain.  It came with fries, that were super good.  Perfectly salted, skin on fries that were cooked crispy.  Yum! Pretzal w/ beer cheese- carbs and cheese...no complaints here!  I enjoy the Penn Brewery Beers.  I've had the pilsner, gold and dark.  All 3 are easy to drink and tasty.  The service there seems to allow you to enjoy your meal and drinks.  It's feels like a communial, social, gathering place.  The staff isn't bothering you a million times while you eat.  Overall, I liked the place, and would recommend it.  We didn't have any entrees, so I'm not sure how those dishes are but our appetizers and flatbread were worth trying."}
{"text":"I experienced the Penn Brewery for my first time, and I had a good time with my friends and drank some good beer, but the food just wasn't up to snuff.   First things first, the beer.  I had a couple St. Nikolaus Bock Bier's and I thoroughly enjoyed them.  It was dark, malty, and tasty.  For dinner I had the wienerschnitzel w/ spaetzle.  The wienerschnitzel was dry and had a metallic taste to it, and the spaetzle, depending on the bite, was okay or just burnt tasting.  I will definitely go back to drink, and maybe much on a couple things, but never again for dinner."}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Penn Brewery for most of my life with my Dad and it will always be one of my favorite places to get a bite to eat and now as an adult a fresh pint.  Before you walk in the door you know this is a very unique place in the city. Sitting on Troy Hill this building looks down on historic Deutchetown. The Beer Garden outside is gorgeous cobblestone and a wonderful place to eat in the summer and an even more fun place during Oktoberfest.  The moment the wide wooden doors swing open to reveal the Beer Hall you can't help but admire the beautiful brass brewery equipment peering in through a glass barrier at the charming bar. The long tables call to mind the Prancing Pony and the Green Dragon bringing out my inner nerd.   On my most recent visit I had just finished washing down a delicious soft pretzel with beer cheese and a tall pint of Penn Pilsner when my Cheese steak arrived. I have traveled all over the city looking for the perfect cheesesteak and this is it friends. I have had it more times than I can count and the only plate that can take me away from it is maybe their homemade pierogis.   The prices are extremely reasonable for what you get and the experience is unlike any other this side of the Atlantic. I've never had their mixed drinks but only come here of you like beer."}
{"text":"They were out of all the good beer each time I went. Then the last time I saw a mouse run across the floor while eating and was told that's normal... Haven't been back!"}
{"text":"They were out of multiple beers ( the wheat and ginger beers), the soft pretzels didn't taste fresh, and it was odd that the wait staff ordered and ate Giovanni's pizza right on the bar in front of customers. I never like seeing a restaurant staff eat food from another restaurant. Or waitstaff eating in front of customers at all. I like their beer but not a good experience this time."}
{"text":"Penn brewery has improved immensely, now that they've abandoned their \"German Purity Law\" brewing roots.  They are now brewing good, experimental beers as well as their usual house beers. Every month when I've stopped in, they've had something new.   For those of you out of town, Penn is somewhat of a Pittsburgh success story.  They had a rough time a few years back, but the original owner bought back the company and reopened the brew-pub (they were contract brewing for a short while.)  The actual building itself is really cool, and during the summer the outdoor beer garden is open...it sort of feels like you're sitting in an old castle...not too many places where you'd get that feeling in Pittsburgh.    I've eaten here a few times, and while I'm definitely not blown away by the food, it's decent, and it of course goes great with their beer.  They have large portion sizes so don't order too much.  Their hot potato salad, although a little odd, is surprisingly addicting.    Happy hour here is worth mentioning as well . Beers are $3, apps are half price, and on Thursday they do \"Beers & Brats\" with $5 brats.  I'd go to Penn over Church Sucksworks any day of the week."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for Penn Brewery, and was excited to check it out. I forget the type of beer I ordered, but it tasted like Miller Lite. My boyfriend's beer wasn't great either, so that was disappointing. We ordered a stuffed pepper appetizer, which was really good. The peppers were spicy and it was smothered in flavorful tomato sauce and a lot of cheese. I ordered the schnitzel sandwich. It came topped with a dressing, slaw mixture, and pickles, yet it lacked flavor. The schnitzel itself needed salt or some other seasoning! The German potato salad was pretty good--I've had better and worse. I would go again with friends for a good time, but not for the food or beer."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Penn Brewery in so long. But I like that I can get the beer just about anywhere. The brewery itself is laid out and decorated with flair and I especially like the outside patio seating within an urban setting. Food on the menu is good as well. I know you're on the edge of your seats wondering what my favorite pour is and I'll tell ya: Chocolate Meltdown!!"}
{"text":"Penn Brewery is such a fun and unique place! Inside and out. The food and beers are always fresh and authentic, I've never had anything here that I didn't like. The service is excellent, I've been here several times and never had to wait any longer than a few minutes. Their Oktoberfest is a blast even though it gets jam packed, there's live music and excellent food options and the beer comes in a half gallon jug! I definitely consider this place a Pittsburgh staple so if you're in the area, i vote that you check it \"aht\"!"}
{"text":"The food and the beer were good, the service was ok, and the restaurant itself looked, smelled, and sounded like an oversized bar. There was live music there and even before they started, the people downstairs were very loud...to the point we couldn't hear each other across the table."}
{"text":"This is one of the spots I feel lucky we have in the Burgh! I mean, really lucky considering it shuttered its doors for a number of years and reopened semi-recently.   You can't beat this fun of an environment. Toss away the generic Hofbrauhaus get to a Pittsburgh legacy! I love the fun German beer hall feel with the large picnic size tables that just beckon you to sit down with an even larger brew!  I love German food, but there's a really good opportunity to screw it up. Have you ever noticed a lot of the colors of German food blend together? Sauerkraut, perogies, mashed taters (is that German? Whatever!), they all look the same! So making them taste good is a must! I'm a big fan of the perogies - a buttery delicious mixture in a lovely little dumpling. While I'm not really a fan of their sauerkraut, it's too sweet for me, I know some people like it that way (I like mine a little on the sour side). Throw in a pretzel with their beer cheese and some grilled kielbasa and I'm one happy German camper!  I'm a fan of their Penn Pilsner and a big big big fan of their special Chocolate Meltdown, which they debuted last Valentines Day. Now I'm telling you right now, you get yourself to Penn Brewery AS SOON as that comes out this year!  The other thing that's awesome about this place is that they throw a ton of events. Nevermind their month long Oktoberfest, they host bands every couple weeks that jam out inside and out. Speaking of which, they have a great outdoor courtyard for sitting with your fave brew!   And to that I say, oh! oh! oh!"}
{"text":"Service great!! Food good and the beer!??! Wow such good beers!! German style and since I was just in Munich,Germany last month I can attest to it being authentic. We had the traditional Pierogi, Kaiser Sausage platter, Braumeister Steak Sandwich. All was very good"}
{"text":"I went here a couple times for this years Oktoberfest.  Even though it was raining and chilly there was a huge turn out of people as well as a huge parking nightmare.  If you go on a Sunday you definitely miss the traffic, but you also miss the wall-to-wall people, so whichever is your preference.  (Although the poorly maintained parking lot almost knocked off part of my car).  I did enjoy the crowded beer drinking atmosphere, and they even had extra porta-poties for the masses.  If you prefer the great indoors, the women's bathroom was in a shambles, but well impressively maintained for the constant line of 10 people for hours and hours.    The Oktoberfest beer was great, and $15 for a half gallon was great for sharing.  I also had their dark beer which didn't impress me as much as I expected, but was still drinkable.   The food was very German and very tasty.  Three of us had an appetizer platter, and 3 main courses, I got the 'Wurst Platte', and with a round or so of beers the total was around $100.  The sharp taste of the meats and pickles paired well with the beer.   The outside was a great place to drink and hang out with friends, albeit loud and occasionally a bit too close for comfort on a Friday, but quite tranquil and family friendly on Sunday.  The inside was full of warm wood,serenades  from men in lederhosen, and a view to the brewtanks."}
{"text":"Love it once again! Hadn't been to the place in about a year since I was trying some new places. It must have gone through some big changes .The beer is exceptional as always but the food has gotten 100x better homestly. Mac and cheese was excellent, burger was excellent, schnitzel sandwich was really good. Once again I'll definitely be back soon to enjoy more of the food and beers! Good job guys. Welcome back ."}
{"text":"Penn Brewery had been on my list of places to try for quite some time (plus I had a groupon to use!). I'm kind of sad that we waited this long to finally eat there. Our food was delicious and the dinner portions were very filling.  The atmosphere and building itself are pretty neat, as well as the outdoor Biergarten area.  Only complaint of the evening was our so-so waitress, very nice, but very scarce and not assertive at all when I had some questions about the menu, and how to properly pronounce Jaegerschnitzel."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and we were one of just a few tables sitting outside. Sometimes during slow periods, servers can forget about you, but we had great service from start to finish.   We had the fried pickles as an appetizer and loved ones the aioli sauce that accompanied them. For our main course we split the Bier Mac n Cheese and oh-my-god was it delicious. Really rich. My husband is a native German and Penn Brewery is definitely somewhere to head if you're craving good German grub.   Can't end a review without mentioning their beer selection- it is great!"}
