{"text":"Ive only tried the $5 special, which was 1/4 of a rotisserie chicken, with 2 sides.  I had rice and fried green plantains with it.  The food was good, and the price made it absolutely AMAZING.  If you're starving you might want an appetizer with it, but the special is soooo worth the price."}
{"text":"I just moved to Madison.  My boyfriend and I are always on the lookout for good local Mexican.  I got the steak fajitas -very good with yummy flavor.  Although it was pretty empty, I loved the guy that waited on us.  He was very friendly & good recommendations for us to try!"}
{"text":"Superb food, superb service. Prices and portions are great. I recommend this place. 

The corn tortilla tinga tacos are a highlight. All of the meats are flavorful, unlike the bland stuff you get at many Mexican restaurants. A fun bonus is a wide selection of natural sugar Mexican sodas. I tried lime and enjoyed it quite a bit."}
{"text":"I was in town on business with my family tagging along, so we were looking for an inexpensive, local restaurant to enjoy a quick dinner.  We chose A La Brasa after a Yelp search, and we are very happy we did.

We enjoyed complentary chips and salsa before the meal (great salsa!).  I had the shredded pork dish with sweet/hot habanero salsa, served with rice and beans ($9.50)  My son enjoyed the fish taco dinner (same price), and our other two each had the 2 Tamales with Rice and Beans special, for only $5 each for dinner!  

After dinner, we decided to splurge, and we ordered the Napolitano-styled flan, made by the owner's wife.  It was FANTASTIC!

I'd you're looking for a tasty, authentic, and reasonably priced dinner in a very low-key setting, then check this place out."}
{"text":"It's really kind of a just alright. One could tolerate a meal here but when going out the idea is not to tolerate but to really enjoy.

Both me and my partner felt the food was kind of bland."}
{"text":"I ordered the Churrasco A La Brasa with two sides of Yuca Fritas and Chicken smothered with onions/Pollo Encebollada for take-out and was extremely disappointed.  The Churrasco was cooked to death and rubbery, while the website states that it is served medium-rare.  Overall, the portions were underwhelming, especially the yuca fritas as there were only 4 per serving.

The only highlight were the sauces.

I called the manager with my concerns and I told them that I was disappointed and they did nothing to resolve the issue.  They said I got plenty of food for the $20 dollars that I spent.

Definitely not getting my business again."}
{"text":"Amazing little place. Delicious food, prepared with care, a great mix of flavors in every bite. You can taste the freshness of the herbs, spices and vegetables. 

Highlights: rotisserie chicken, grilled fish, salad with chicken a la brasa, sweet plantains, yucca fries, fresh juices (papaya, pineapple, mango, strawberry!). The dipping sauces knock it all out of the park. 

It's almost miraculous that you can feed a family of four a healthy, made-to-order meal of tasty grilled meats served with fresh fruits and vegetables at such a reasonable price. After living in the Twin Cities for a decade, a place like this would always be packed and over-priced. The brasa concept is popular - because it's so tasty and leaves you feeling GOOD. 

This place is a gem and a favorite."}
{"text":"I would really like to talk about the good food and decent prices A La Brasa has, but there is a negative part of this restaurant that is so bad that I can't even seem to enjoy the food anymore. 

The negative part is the service. The wait service is terrible. I would even venture to say it is the worst service I've had at any Madison restaurant. You will not be brought water; rather, you will be required to (awkwardly) walk up to the front counter and ask for water. The same goes for your check when you're done eating. The horrendous service also applies to take-out orders. The staff frequently makes mistakes, they're slower than a turtle with four broken legs trying to cross the street, and they really just don't seem to care about providing satisfactory service. 

Bottom line: Good Mexican food (including good taco Tuesday deals), but the service is absolutely ATROCIOUS."}
{"text":"Great food and good prices.  The service was friendly and they explained all of the specials to us.  Nice outdoor seating too"}
{"text":"I've come back here a few more times since my original review and decided that they need 5 stars.  They rock the lunch!  I have left happy every time I've visited.   

Things that rock:  Chicken sandwich, rotisserie chicken, fried rice plates, any of their sides, and of course -- the dipping sauces!!"}
{"text":"I had heard good things about A La Brasa (especially about their daily drink deals) so we decided to give it a try.
I tried to order the 3 amigos but they were out of tamales and they were also out of tortas. We got an arrangement of tacos- they were fine but not great and not worth going back for.
The one redeeming aspect was the $2 spotted cow bottles."}
{"text":"The reason why I only star because I came there once to have the rusticity chicken and it was okay even though that it wasn't on \"Brazza\" the sauces were not right than I came last Saturday to have the paella and I went to Peru once and lived there for three months so I know a little about their Cousine but what I had it wasn't nothing even close I understand that Wisconsin's not the best place for seafood but at least  I had tasted better paellas.. Poor service ,Poor quality, and worthless."}
{"text":"The Peruvian rotisserie chicken isn't as good as what you could find in, say, DC or LA. But it's decent. This place also has good tacos, quick service, late hours, and good prices. Just try not to get lured away by the curry fumes next door."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. Staff is rude and food is ok. Friend had the chicken chimichanga and enjoyed it. I had the chicken tinga tacos and they were a little spicy."}
{"text":"I saw the reviews of this place and thought I'd give it a try since I lived nearby. I was really not impressed with the food. I ordered the enchiladas and they were lacking in flavor and heat in my opinion. Also the portion of beans and rice I received was very small. I don't think I will be returning a second time with various other options around Madison."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best Mexican restaurant in town. The food is fresh and well done.  We ordered the quesadilla which was huge! The chicken was flavorful and there were fresh onions in it. I ordered the three Marias which was three enchiladas ( red, green and mole).  The mole was delicious and more chocolately than most places. The rice was fresh tasting and excellent.  My husband enjoyed the taco and tamale as well.  The service was great. Our server was a charming gentleman from southern mexico. We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Madison!

Awesome toastados and salsa/hot sauce. Really happy they changed this place to Mexican food"}
{"text":"Want cheap, good tex mex? This is your place. The tacos and the half chicken are my favorites. They have horchata sometimes that I also enjoy. You won't get fancy-- but that's not what you came for."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Madison. Very casual and inexpensive. The chicken is great! The tamales they have on the weekend are not to be missed. I seriously love this place."}
{"text":"Great value. Great service. Good simple food. Nothing too fancy here. Great place to have a beer and relax if you are looking for something low key. I visit often and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"Please note, as of September 2013, A La Brasa Latin Cuisine is under new ownership and has switched their menu to Mexican cuisine.  The restaurant still offers a full bar, including Mexican tequilas and the standard cervezas Corona and Modelo.

The menu has changed to a variety of standard Mexican dishes including tacos, burritos, sopes, quesadillas, huaraches and tamales.  It also offers some more unusual dishes such as their Chicken a la brasa, mole poblano and pipian verde chicken (chicken with green sauce).  Chicken strips and grilled cheese sandwiches are available for the little ones that my not be as adventurous.  Prices are very reasonable.  

There is a great variety of meats available for the dishes including beef, pastor (pork seasoned with chilies and pineapple) and chorizo.  I have so far tried the steak and pasture tacos, steak burrito and chicken tamales.  

The tacos arrived served on two corn tortillas each with a good helping of onions and cilantro and a side of mild salsa consisting of roasted tomatoes rather than the standard chopped uncooked tomatoes, onions and cilantro. The pastor taco was delicious.  It was not overly seasoned and the taste of the pineapple was evident.  The steak taco was even better. Once again, not overly seasoned, but enough to enhance the flavor of the saut√©ed steak rather than mask it.  Both meats were cooked properly, neither under done nor dried out from too much time on the grill.     

Likewise, the tamales were excellent.  The masa in these were steamed to a very good consistency, neither mushy nor dried out.  Tamales unfortunately tend to be on the bland sides.  These were not as they were either flavored with a green sauce (salsa verde) or a red sauce (salsa rojo).  The red sauce was the spicier of the two; both with an unexpected flavor for tamales.  

The burrito was also very good.  I am generally not a fan of burritos stuffed with rice and beans, the steak meat was of a much greater quantity than the plant food.  The steak was the same flavor as the steak tacos and the rest of the mixture was pinto beans, rice, cilantro and onions.  The tortilla was also heated on the grill, rather than steamed like in many other places, which added another layer of flavor.

A La Brasa is conveniently located on North Broom Street, between West Washington and Capitol Center Foods.  While at times it could take a little bit of hunting, there is street parking available.  The new owners are now also offering delivery service through a third party service.  With the convenience of the location and reasonableness of the prices, it will become my \"go to\" place for lunch."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Madison! Especially great place during the summer. Great place to sit outside on a warm day sipping on a beer while enjoying some authentic tacos. Nothing fancy, that's all you need."}
{"text":"I've been going to A La Brasa almost weekly for over a year. The food is authentic Mexican and really, really tasty. They have specials every day (I'm a big fan of the buy 2 get 1 free taco deal on Tuesday, especially). The salsa is made fresh in-house, like everything! The owner works very hard to keep the place running at top quality - I think he's there seven days a week. They have a small staff but they're always really nice and courteous. Definitely a hidden gem and cannot recommend enough."}
{"text":"This is a mixed bag. The service was hands down the worst I have ever seen. We were almost done with our meal when they brought the appetizer. When we were ready for the check they realized we haven't gotten all our drinks out yet and brought us the last drink.

The food was decent, and deserves better than 2 stars, but the bad service couldn't make up for it.

I am finishing this review just now (April 2014). The review pertains to our visit to A La Brasa in July 2013"}
{"text":"Excellent place to enjoy a meal , our waiter was really attentive and funny , i felt that he knows the food . The food was delicious and it really has the peruvian flavor ;) ... I cant wait to go back to eat here :) ... Yummy yummy  !!"}
{"text":"I live around the corner from this place and have walked by so many times loving what I smelled. My girlfriend and I kept saying once it warmed up and their patio was open we would grab dinner here - well tonight was that night.

We sat at a table outside and waited for a solid 10 minutes before someone brought menus and asked if we wanted anything to drink. We ordered a beer and a margarita which did come fairly quickly but that was the only quick thing about this endeavor. Another 25-30 minutes went by before we had our waitress ask if we wanted to put in an order. I was super close to just getting up and leaving but the other reviews I read mentioned the food being great and service being terrible so we were in until the end now.

We put in an order for tacos, tamales, quesadilla and the pork carnitas, and we opted to ask for it to go. It took around 45 minutes to get the food and we headed home to eat. The tamales were nothing special but definitely not bad, the chicken was on the drier side for these. The quesadillas were quite good, I had no complaints here either, and the tacos we got were the standout of the meal. I was pretty disappointed at how much of the carnitas I had to throw away though as they were large chunks of fat with zero meat on them. The flavor was good but again nothing social here. If this place was quick with their service it would balance out with the food being only alright. Honestly I wouldn't go back here unless I had no other options, but this is Madison where we have a ton of great options. If I want some good Mexican food, I'll head to Taqueria 3 Amigos (take out only) where they are insanely nice and the food is extremely flavorful and authentic and just downright better in all ways."}
{"text":"favorite Mexican restaurant of a Mexican friend, and I like it too. Tasty food in large quantity, acceptable price, friendly waitor. Nothing negative. one kind remind is that Mexican sauce is quite spicy, you may not add too much for the first time as I did. Also I didn't see any large tables there so it may not be a wise choice if you have tens of friends come with you, 4 or 5 will be fine though."}
{"text":"We had mole poblanco and some other spicy food with steak. I didn't like any of these two choices. The first one was just bad, oily and bitter and the other one was extremely spicy. The only nice thing were the tortillas."}
{"text":"Great find in Madison.  The vibe is city dining and the staff is friendly and welcoming.
I should mention the food is authentic, fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"I like A La Brasa. I like the food. I like the quiet, polite server. I like the prices. 

There's not much seating. We saw a lot of people get take-out. There's a pretty large space where it seems like another table or two could go, but it is actually used for people to stand as they line up at the counter to order, pick-up and pay for their food. There's no parking. It's a limited menu. The decor is austere. They don't give you chips and salsa. 

However, there is a constant stream of people coming in to get food. That's because the prices are right, the food is good, and it's quick. I'm not going to take anyone there to impress them, but I am going to go there often to get a good meal."}
{"text":"I've been here A couple of times and the food never disappoints but the service does sometimes. The last time I went was Taco Tuesday where you get two tacos for the price of one but there was only one server running around. They also ran out of tongue tacos (which are the best) which is the best! The food is fab definitely - try to go when it's not too busy or you'll end up serving you and your friends drinks as well as bringing menus, checks, and whatever else you need."}
{"text":"Two of us shared chicken enchiladas with red sauce, steak fajitas, and four different tacos so we could get a sample of a bunch of items. That along with two drinks was under $50! We thoroughly enjoyed the casual, brightly colored atmosphere. Our servers were nice and helpful. The food was good! I would maybe try a different sauce on the enchiladas next time, and I would be interested in trying their breakfast in the future. Definitely recommend for an inexpensive date night... especially for fit people who can crush some food! :)"}
{"text":"Happened to come to this place because my friend and I couldn't decide where to eat for Dinner. I'm from Cali and have a very particular sense for Mexican food and while this place was quaint and had one guy running the whole show it was subpar for the meal. I ordered a carnitas burrito which was just okay. The chips and salsa were great and free refills, but I don't have to come back to this place again. It was okay prices, semi okay food, and the environment is charming, but not the best. 

Happy finding!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant in Madison by far. The food is authentic and delicious and in the spirit of seemingly all Mexican restaurants, the value for your dollar is fantastic. We stopped in recently and were told they have a new menu. It didn't disappoint. Everything we ordered was delicious. My favorite is the Bistec a la Mexicana. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place has the best chimichangas in Madison - at least which I have come across. Absolutely fantastic. A flour shell wrapped around the meat of your choice, wrapped in layers of cheese and lettuce, and deep fried. They then drown that puppy in a cheese sauce and top it with lettuce, then serve it with a side of refried beans and spanish style rice. Green and red chili sauces are also provided for your gustatory pleasure.

And then that first bite... heaven.

Taco tuesday, discount beer wednesday, and dollar off margaritas friday are all worth checking out. Also worth noting that every table gets house made tortilla chips and delicious house salsa!

Only knock here is that the service can be slow - it's really a crapshoot. Sometimes you will get your food very quickly; other times you will wait half an hour or longer. Quality of the food also varies somewhat with who is in the kitchen and the phase of the moon.

Don't let that deter you though. Even on an off day, A La Brasa is still quality mexican food. And seriously, those Chimichangas. Oh man, those Chimichangas.

You should seriously check this place out."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom for a casual dinner last week. We were hungry for simple, good, affordable Mexican food and this place delivered. It was so good we brought the entire family for lunch the next day. 

In short: very flavorful and juicy meats, simple but delicious sides. Great house made salsa and chips. Ambiance lacks intimacy, service is very friendly but not ultra fast. Don't eat in if you're in a hurry. Hours listed on door and menu differ - confirm hours if you want to come here late night. $2 any beer on Wednesdays. Full bar. 

Food: 5 stars, especially for the price. Generous quantities. Their meats were fantastic, we tried several as a group and the winners were their grilled chicken (no, really, it's Peruvian style and so good) and cochinita pibil (not yet on the menu but usually a daily special, it is the waiter's mother's recipe). Great housemade chips and salsa. 

Ambiance: 3 stars. Only ten tables, many of which are wobbly. The place is clean and has been recently renovated. Sometimes the cook has her kids in the kitchen and you occasionally hear the baby cry. 

Service: 4 stars. We had the same waiter both trips. He is ultra friendly, and very knowledgeable about the recipes and traditional Mexican ingredients. Though this place is listed as Central and/or South American cuisine, our waiter explained that the place transitioned to almost exclusively Mexican since the new owner took over a year ago. They maintain a few Peruvian dishes on the menu. I had to ask for a water refill a few times, but overall good service. Take out is quick, dine in service is not. 

I know all that averages to 4 stars, but I'm giving it 5 stars since it's a great little joint and because America."}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing.  Authentic tacos, and very affordable.  Everything is made to order.  The manager and staff are very personable.  Very speedy service, especially if you call in an order.  Favorite Mexican in Madison!"}
{"text":"They've got a half-dozen rotisserie chickens cooking in the front of this restaurant - so you know the chicken is going to be good! I walked over for lunch today, and had 3 really solid (and really cheap) tacos. Friendly service, quick spot to eat, I really liked the experience."}
{"text":"It's a great low key place. The fruit juices are fresh, and the fish is fantastic. You can even get whole tilapia fish, which is a rare find in Madison. There are also fired plantains available! Menu is not overwhelming and really reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I think I recall the food being OK but it was absolutely freezing and they refused to turn on any heat."}
{"text":"We arrived and snagged a table easily, however it was beginning to get busy.

Service is HORRIBLY slow....like we waited a painful 15 mins at an empty table and I had to flag a waitress down for menus.  It seemed there were only two servers for the entire restaurant, which isn't that big IMO.  I then had to ask for waters after the chips and salsa were hastily dropped off.  It took another 20 mins of waiting to place our order...again needing to flag the waitress down.  We ordered another round of chips and salsa to fill what I expected would be more waiting (first basket is complimentary, \"refills\" are $1).  The hubs also ordered a house margarita.  I had 3 tacos (tinga, carnitas and asada) and the hubs had the 3 Maria combo (enchiladas)

The food was out within 10 mins...disappointing that the kitchen could keep up with the busy restaurant but the dining room couldn't.

The tacos were good, but nothing to write home about.  The hubs food was fine with a side of comical, he literally had a teaspoon serving of rice next to his small serving of beans...almost as if the side of rice and beans were a halfarsed after thought.  The hubs made multiple comments and faces trying to drink his margarita too.  It was very limey...uh, could use some tequila to cut that citrus.  Ultimately, he couldn't finish it because it was more margarita mix than tequila.  Major problem  when the hubs is passing up on his drank...bc something has to be pretty bad for that man to NOT want to finish a drink.

I have no desire to go back."}
{"text":"A La Brasa is a modest Mexican joint, serving up authentic and delicious fare. I tried the mole enchiladas with chicken. They were really good, fresh and savory without too much salt and served with a generous helping of rice and beans. 

Prices were also good: my mole dinner was less than $10 for a large portion. My only complaint is concerning the chips and salsa. The salsa was excellent: fresh and spicy, but the chips were extraordinarily salty, and stale. I always prefer freshly fried tortillas when I go to a Mexican place."}
{"text":"Ordered the 3 Amigos. All of the protein was burnt, but I cleaned my plate anyway. Flavors were decent."}
{"text":"Once Latin American focused, recently changed to primarily a Mexican menu. 

We stopped by for $2 Beer Wednesdays and were impressed to see the patio full of people with the same idea...

Chips and salsa were pretty good. Mole enchiladas were alright - the mole sauce lacked depth. Bottom line: food is much better than a chain Mexican restaurant but not as good as Guadalajara or the other classics in town."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The food is super! Great flavor, very authentic and a bargain.  The owner and the cashier made me feel very welcome. Both were so friendly. I enjoyed the Torta. It was huge. My daughters had a steak quesadilla (real adventurous, this one ;) ) and the chicken mole.  Both were flavorful and well-made.  I highly recommend this restaurant for mexican food in the the downtown area."}
{"text":"My friend simply asked for the variety of margs that were offered... instead we were given an additional marg with all of the flavors mixed together. Yes, we had to pay for it. Additionally, there is a $10 minimum on card orders. Seems a little ridiculous considering it's a restaurant and this isn't written or mentioned anywhere... wouldn't have minded that much about the minimum if it wasn't Taco Tuesday so prices for food and drinks were reduced immensely. This should be fixed to avoid confusion in the future."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. It's a small joint but their meat was really flavorful and tender. We tried carne asada and tinga chicken and both were delicious. Can't beat a nice meal for two with drinks for less than $20."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today with a friend and absolutely loved it! I ordered the torta with pastor and it was amazing. The meat had such a good flavor and there was grilled pineapple in it that brought it to a whole new level. My friend ordered the steak chimichanga and it was also great. Our server was nice and very prompt."}
{"text":"Super yummy food and also great margs ;-) order the chimichanga and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"The Good: This place is amazing. From service to atmosphere to food, it is an absolute hidden gem. The staff was friendly and personal- one of my friends noted you could tell the food was going to be good because the staff was so knowledgeable and passionate. At one point, my friend who is gluten free inquired about whether a certain dish had flour. One of the staff jumped right in and gave her the most in-depth reassurance that only one dish was not gluten free and that the kitchen itself was dedicated to keeping the flour separate. Needless to say, my friend was glowing. 
The food itself was delicious. We ordered steak fajitas, enchiladas, tamales, tacos, and a burrito. Each individual at our table gave their dish a 10/10. They also provided ample sides in the form of shredded lettuce, rice, and beans. We left feeling stuffed and all at a good price. 

The Not So Good: Literally nothing. In the words of one of my friends: \"this is going to be my new place.\" 

Highlight: Our server was beyond personable!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place in town, the carnitas taco is perfection every time. Good margaritas as well, staff if very friendly and the outdoor seating is great"}
{"text":"This place is great! It has quickly become the restaurant our office goes to on those occasions we go out to eat as a staff. 

The food is out of this world and the service is always top shelf. The $2 beers on Wednesday don't hurt either. 

Wonderful place for lunch."}
{"text":"3/5- food was good, but nothing special. I got the enchiladas in a red salsa and my friend got the carnitas quesadillas. They give you plenty of food. 

Service was okay, but the main pro is that we good our food shortly after ordering. They also have a deal on beer on Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Tacos were great and the conversation with waiter Jonathan made us feel at home. A few blocks from our hotel. A cool find. Good food, Spotted Cow beer (a WI exclusive) and an outdoor patio. Perfection!!"}
{"text":"Love A La Brasa - it's the only authentic and reasonably priced Mexican food restaurant in the downtown area. The meats are flavorful, they don't try to be Tex-Mex, and when you ask for spicy- it's actually spicy.

The service is great whether you sit in, take out, or get delivery."}
{"text":"For starters the chips are delicious-crunchy and warm and the salsa is amazing!  The waitress was so sweet and gave an excellent recommendation for dinner that we both loved.  My son said he wished he had ordered the bigger size of the quesadilla because he liked it so much.  The ingredients were fresh and the food was very flavorful and delicious! !  Would definetely recommend this place and will come back."}
{"text":"Delicious, cheap, great ambience - quiet and laid back. And friendly wait staff. A new favorite."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident but are very happy we did! Everything was excellent from the authentic food, to the drinks, to the service. Our waiter was very accommodating, made great suggestions and even brought out an authentic herb for us to try. Very reasonably priced as well. Has an adorable shaded patio you can dine on. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"$6 huevos rancheros were incredible. Very authentic food. I asked if I could have them spicier and they definitely delivered. 

The chips and salsa were great, too. They have a wide variety of authentic drinks if you want alcohol. All in all, a nice quiet spot I will definitely return to."}
{"text":"The rotisserie chicken w/ beans + rice was excellent! And at a price ~$9 you can not find a healthier option that is as fast and friendly. I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Delicioso!! New restaurant. The flavors of south america in one place. The restaurant work as buffet. My favorite is the chicken a la brasa!! Uhhhh muy rico."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. Definitely my favorite place to get latin american food in downtown madison. Excellent prices and cheap beer. Going to be coming here a lot."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this via the yelp app while in Madison on business and glad I did.  Service was slow it the food was so good it didn't matter.  I had the chicken enchiladas and they were amazing!  The other in my party had the chicken fajitas and there was so much could have been two meals.    It was authentic Mexican."}
{"text":"Great enchiladas! And it may sound weird but their rice and beans on the side are some of the most delicious I've ever had. Not too expensive and the wait staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"I always love heading to A La Brasa for authentic, delicious Mexican food in Madison.  The prices are always awesome and the food is so consistently good, it's hard not to love.  My favorite dish on the menu is the Chimichanga, which the chefs were happy enough to make a vegetarian version of for me. The free chips and salsa are delicious, and the margaritas (I got mine frozen and mango flavored) are delicious and refreshing!  One of my favorite aspects of the restaurant is the cute outdoor patio, which is great for summer. I genuinely feel that A la Brasa has that unique combination of being authentically Mexican but also affordable, something you don't always see in gimmicky Tex-mex places or questionable hole-in-the-walls.  Although it's a bit off the beaten path (~5 min from State St), it's 100% worth venturing off for..  You won't be disappointed with the delicious food, cute (although cheesy) d√©cor, or the always kind staff.  And hey, the margaritas are always a perk!"}
{"text":"Confused, but after traveling all day we were starving.

The menu selection didn't match what  we saw online. The menu was basically Mexican which was fine with us. The mole so delicious reminds me of the first time I had it over thirty years ago. The chicken mole enchiladas where so tasty, stuffed to the max with chicken. Just couldn't not stop eating them, but probably should have so very filling! Hubby had the fajitas, you don't want to know how many tortillas he filled. Both our plates where empty, even so we shared a flan. Oh just go there."}
{"text":"First time going yesterday, might be the best Mexican food in town. The 3 tacos that I had were amazing, and there actually authentic! Chips and Salsa were off the chain. $5 Margaritas everyday and $2 beers on Wednesday (including new glarus)"}
{"text":"Delicious!  I live close and have tried a lot off of their menu - all has been wonderful.  Very friendly staff and pretty quick service even on 2-4-1 Taco night =)"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Very authentic Mexican food!  The Pico De Gallo was so delicious I couldn't stop eating it and the chips. I had the tortillas chips tossed in hot salsa with huevos.  It was delicious!  The staff was SO nice to us. We really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"A La Brasa serves good and authentic Latin American food at a great price. They've got a great location away from the faster pace of State Street. It's an excellent place to sit outside and enjoy a beer (especially on 2$ night -- Wednesday). Food is great with interesting specials on rotation. A neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"Wow! I guess Madison has extremely low standards for Mexican food. This is possibly the worse food I have had in many years. The service was horrific, the food was a joke and prepared the opposite of how we asked. No onions, they put extra onions, their drinks have no alcohol. Save yourself the money and trouble. Avoid this shit hole"}
{"text":"My friend and I have been here three times now. Twice I've had the Torta and it has been really good. Very large and delicious. I love the bread! Last night I had their other sandwich, I believe, was the Cemitas Las Poblanitas. I chose the breaded chicken and it blew me away. It was a very thin strip of lightly breaded chicken, sliced avocado, onions, a fantastic stringy stretchy cheese, and a hot sauce that was perfect for my taste (Just enough bite, you can order much hotter). The bread though, it's amazing.

Breaded chicken on a sandwich usually isn't my thing. But I just wanted to try something new, and I can't wait to go back and get another. It's delicious! 

My friend got the chili, and he thought it was really good. He said how good that was all night. It was a very large bowl, too!

So good!"}
{"text":"I've only been to A La Brasa a handful of times, and ordered from there on EatStreet a few times. I have been satisfied with the food in person and on takeout. The service in the restaurant was great. The place kinda lacks warmth and ambiance - its definitely more of a lunch sit-down type place as opposed to a nice sit-down dinner spot. I will continue to go there/order takeout and will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"There are very few places in Madison to get authentic Mexican tacos, and A La Brasa is one of them. I've only recently started going here but I wish I knew about it sooner. 

I've yet to have a dish from here I didn't like. The service is fast and the margs are always a favorite."}
{"text":"I got the rotisserie chicken and fries. My husband got the beef plantain dish. As I am writing this review, I turn to him and asked him what the dish was called, and he said, \"Ohhhh that was soooo good. I loved that! It was the carne asada plantain dish.\" 

I don't know the formal name, but I will trust that it was delicious. I had a portion of the plantain and it was uber garlicky. I LOVE garlic, and I will definitely be getting the chicken version next time we stop by.

The rotisserie chicken was great. It needs a tad more flavor, perhaps marinating it, but otherwise, it is the bees knees."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but I can't wait to go back! I loved the server (who may have been the owner?). He very nicely explained anything we had questions about and didn't look down on us for not knowing what things were. Honestly, I would go back just because he was amazing!

The food was excellent as well. The menu had many options and I appreciated that anything could be made vegetarian. Warning - the salsa verde is quite spicy, but very delicious.

Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely recommend this cute little place to anyone looking for authentic Mexican cuisine."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. I definitely recommend coming here for a casual and inexpensive meal or for takeout. I personally really enjoy the huraches, but everything on the menu looks good! 

Beer specials on Wednesday nights!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food. Truly authentic. Tacos and tamales are great. Half-priced tacos on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for months and just never made it in. What a mistake. I decided to try a few different items because the prices were really reasonable. I had the $5 rotisserie chicken dinner. Absolutely delicious. Latin spices, perfectly tender. Throw in two sides, I had the beans and rice. Beans were served in a little corn tortilla bowl, and the rice was very moist with hints of spice. I also ordered two chorizo tacos at $2 each. Typical authentic tacos. Two corn tortillas each, wonderful chorizo, and topped with saut√©ed sliver of white onions. Either of those was a meal, however I ate it all, because I'm a pig, and it was too good to stop.  I washed it down with a $2 bottle beer.  Yuuuuuuuummmmmmm. All this for a shade over $11 bucks.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 friends for a late lunch/early dinner and the service was great. I got cactus huaraches and they were delicious and huge. The chips were freshly baked and the pico was really flavorful. It was all really affordable too."}
{"text":"Found a great Mexican restaurant walking distance to the office. Great mole sauce and the chips and salsa were delicious."}
{"text":"Suffering from a mild bout of cabin fever, my daughter and I decided to brave the arctic conditions and grab some spicy food at A La Brasa.  I reviewed the menu options online before our visit and had a couple Peruvian-influenced items in mind when we walked through the doors.  However, the restaurant now describes itself as a \"Mexican Grill\", so it was time for a quick change of plans (note to management - please update your online menu).

After seating us, our server dropped off a basket of standard-grade corn chips and a bowl of pico de gallo.  The chips were heavily salted and were nothing to write home about.  The pico de gallo was excellent - it was loaded with fresh onions, cilantro and tomatoes along with a healthy dose of jalapenos.  My only problem with it was the bowl was too small and every time we tried to use a chip to scoop some out, most of the contents ended up on the table.  Because of this, we soon ran out of pico de gallo, but our server was too engrossed with a cell phone call to notice that we needed a refill.  

After adjusting to the new menu, I decided about the beef version of the Cemita Poblana sandwich ($10).  The sesame-encrusted bun was a disappointment; it had the texture of a hamburger bun from the local Piggly Wiggly.  Also disappointing was the beef cutlet - too little beef and far too much of the greasy breading.   I did enjoy the rest of the sandwich, which included loads of buttery oaxaca cheese, slightly sweet caramelized onions, spicy chipotle peppers and perfectly ripe avocados.  

The $7 cheese quesadilla ordered by my daughter became a comedy of errors.  She is a vegetarian and the first version of her cheese quesadilla was peppered with small chunks of chicken.  We flagged down another server (our initial server was still busy on his cell phone) who apologized for the error and promised to make a cheese-only version.  It came ten minutes later, but this time, the thick corn tortilla was a soggy mess.  (I wonder if it sat on the counter too long, since the first quesadilla did not have this problem.)  The replacement quesadilla also lacked a serving of the salsa verde that added some much needed zip to this dish.  We again flagged down a server, and after another wait, we received the green salsa.  By then the whole thing was getting cold - ugh.  While my daughter did enjoy the melted oaxaca cheese, she stated she strongly preferred the $3 Los Gemelos version of this dish.  With no sides, this dish was a poor value.

The interior of the restaurant was extremely clean, flooded with natural light and nicely decorated.  

Overall, the negatives of my visit (spotty service, lackluster food) outweighed the positive (superb pico de gallo).  With so many other great, local options for Mexican food, I doubt that I will be paying A La Brasa a return visit."}
{"text":"Great food, and the prices are easy on my wallet.

The server/owner is a lovely man too. Don't worry about what's listed as breakfast, lunch, and dinner on the menu. It's a small business, and they'll make you any of it at any time."}
{"text":"Yum! Some of the best tacos I've had in Madison and for just $2.50 each, who could resist?! The restaurant was pretty empty when I visited on a Thursday afternoon, but it made for even faster service so I couldn't complain. I ordered the al pastor and lengua tacos and wow were they good! The meat was super tasty, corn tortilla was fresh and offered good support to the filling inside, and it was topped with onions and cilantro. The tacos were packed well and two were a perfect meal for me. Would love to come back and try a few more! I know they have special deals on different days of the week as well, so there's no reason not to return.

The only suggestion I have would be to switch up the music choices - the food, restaurant, and everything else felt truly authentic but there are only so many times I can listen to Justin Bieber's rendition of Despacito and some Pitbull when I know there is other music to be offered.

Keep up the great food, A La Brasa!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food at great prices. Happy to see the nice mix of Mexican cervezas including my favorite, Pacifico. For the warmer months it has a nice tree covered patio. Looking forward to making this place a regular part of my week."}
{"text":"I often wait for 10 minutes without seeing a server - not a complaint, just something to be aware of. I wouldn't come if you're in a rush; service is reasonably fast once they start serving you, but it definitely has the ambience and food of a place you'll want to chill at for at least an hour. They introduced me to seafood ceviche and their purple corn drink. I highly recommend both. If you're not into seafood their other choices are great as well."}
{"text":"I was very excited to eat here since one of my friends said the good was delicious. So I drove there to see that the place was closed on a Wednesday in the middle of the day. The hours said 11-10 and no sign of why they were close at 3pm.... Disappointed."}
{"text":"This is one of the the best values in Madison. The food is very good. I would describe it as Mexican with a South American twist. Every item on the menu is good, service is friendly and prices are great! Weather permitting there is a nice patio to sit outside and a good Cevesa beer selection. A true value in food and taste."}
{"text":"Awesome Food, and the best staff in the area....  Taste the oaxaca cheese , and the tacos !!"}
{"text":"Do not go if you want authentic fresh Latin food. There food is of very low quality, and very high prices for what you get. I was not impressed one bit. This is as bland and unoriginal as it gets, was really disappointed with the chicken; flavorless."}
{"text":"La Brasa has incredibly fresh, authentic, made-to-order menu items. I had steak and al pastor tacos with guacamole to start. 

The service was also super quick. I can see myself coming back or ordering out again and again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delighted to find this place right in my neighborhood. It's very casual, but the service is friendly and prompt. The table salsa is fresh, spicy and delicious; we had enchiladas and carnitas and both were tasty and generous.  I expect we'll make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"I love good Mexican food and seem to have a difficult time finding good quality Mexican food anywhere on the east side. So we headed downtown, and ate at A La Brasa for lunch during the week and chose to dine outside at a table. At first I began longing for Indian fare, because Maharani is just feet away, and their robust food smells were lofting my way, but my attention was quickly returned to the place at hand when I saw another guest's food brought to their table. Smelled and looked delicious!
We were brought tortilla chips and salsa prior to ordering. The chips here are heftier compared to many restaurants. They weren't heavy or anything, they were very good. Salsa was great as well, just a bit of heat. For my meal, I ordered a combination plate, and chose a chicken enchilada, chicken taco and beef taco (tamales were all sold out, or I would have had a tamale).
They offer a choice of red or green sauce and I picked the red. All three items were wonderful and fresh. The chicken was not shredded which is  usually my preference, but still really good. Everything was flavored really well. The red sauce had a little heat, but not too hot at all. 
I also ordered a frozen strawberry margarita. No complaints here! Loved it! 
Prompt service, nice outside accommodations, wonderful food. Prices are extremely reasonable. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"A La Brasa is a great neighborhood restaurant that's VERY affordable.

My favorite thing about A La Brasa is their nightly drink specials. On Wednesdays, all beers are $2.50 (used to be $2 but they increased the price!) and on Fridays, they have margarita specials (albeit for pre-mixed frozen margaritas). They also have tacos for $2.50 on Tuesday nights.

I had a little trouble finding vegetarian options on the menu. There are a few, but they're not indicated in any way and they use Spanish terms for some of the meat (like carnitas, chorizo, and some others that I didn't recognize). I got the Huevos a la Mexicana, which had eggs and a bunch of vegetables in it. It was cooked well, but it was SO spicy because it had so many jalapenos in it. The menu mentioned that they were in the dish, but it didn't indicate that it was a spicy dish. I won't be getting that one again.

The patio out front is perfect in the summer and is just off the street enough that you're not bothered by the traffic. We weren't able to sit outside, but I've seen lots of others dining out there.

Like I said earlier, it's decent for a neighborhood spot and has great drink specials, but not my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Very small yet very authentic! Decorations were great and the food was marvelous. My friend and I are both vegetarians and had no problem finding something to eat. Only thing is I wish there wasn't a big TV on the wall. For the size of the restaurant it was sort of distracting."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  Had the sope\"s with chorizo.  Fantastic.  Finished by splitting a flan dessert.  One of the best I have had.  Highly recommended if you are downtown for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day and was very impressed! The waiter was so so nice and very grandfatherly. I felt very welcomed.

First of all, the chips are amazing. They're crisp and crunchy and warm and more importantly, not overly seasoned. The accompanying pico de gallo was sour and spicy, which was good, but a little on the salty side.

To start, we ordered guacamole with fried tortilla rolls. The guacamole was chunky just the way I like it and it was on the sweeter side, but it worked well with the other flavors.

I ordered the chicken enchilada with red sauce. At this point, I was already getting full from all the chips. The shredded chicken was cooked very well - it wasn't dry at all. The rice was so moist that it melted in my mouth, in a good way.

I definitely recommend coming here. I don't recommend sitting outside in the summer with all the mosquitos. There sure are a ton of them out here."}
{"text":"The food here is a little different than the typical Mexican food you would find in Madison. It's a small, fun environment and the staff is always super friendly.  I would recommend their quesadillas for sure. Also, their tortas are the best I've ever been able to find in the city."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights

1) budget friendly
2) slow service
3) authentic food

We visited A La Brasa on a summer week night and chose to eat on their patio outside. The patio has about 5 tables. The outdoor ambiance is much better than the indoor section. Indoor space feels more like a grab and go restaurant than a sit down place.

After waiting a little bit, a server came around and dropped off chips and salsa (complimentary) and took our drink order. The service was pretty slow, but in their defense I think there were maybe 3 people working. We ordered the cheese dip and it was that super good, melted white cheese....YUM. In addition to being really good, I think the cost of the appetizer was $2/$3. The portions aren't huge but they are priced fairly. I ordered the combo plate (which we waited awhile for) and it had a tamale, an enchilada, and a taco. You could tell the food was really authentic! 

We ended up both getting drinks as well. The margaritas were ok, I'm pretty sure they came from a mix. 

2 drinks, 1 appetizer, and 2 entrees later our bill was only $25. We live in the area and will definitely be back but probably not somewhere to go out of way to get to!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican / Latin food in town! I live down the block, go here at least once every two weeks (the owner definitely knows our order)

Favorites include the chorizo chimichanga, poblano enchiladas, chorizo and steak tacos (half price on Tuesdays!)

I'm always so glad there's always business here, they deserve it!"}
