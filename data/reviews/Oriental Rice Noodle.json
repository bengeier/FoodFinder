{"text":"I've been tried out different Yunnan soup noodle places all over toronto and excited to find this place. it's located near shoppers drug mart at warden and steeles, pretty easy to find. Interior design, the pots, and the presentation of food were pretty good. But that kinda wore off 20mins into eating. The side dishes were barely visible, I got 2 pieces of pork and a chicken wing as the only protein, and let's say I couln't even finish the chicken wing even tho I hate leaving anything in my bowel after a meal. 

The waitress didn't mention about the free refill and I didn't really see it at any obvious place on the menu, so I miss it. My bf was not full at the end of meal. Would be nice if they at least remind us its an option. 

We also order the squid tentacle and squid, its oily with little sauce and no spice on it at all. Squid taste a bit raw, I ended up dump it in my soup to make sure we don't get diarrhea after. 

I may give it 2 stars if not for the yummy soup they had. I order the original and my bf order the spice soup base. Mine was really flavorful and goes really well with rice noodles. 

May not visit again anytime soon, consider it really doesn't have anything else on the menu. would be better if given option to pick toppings."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic northern Chinese mi xian (???rice noodle), this is the place. The noodles come with different broths (mild to spicy), and their complementary dish allows you to pick what you put into the soup. Each bowl comes with unlimited noodles, which is great for people who can eat a lot or just a bowl!

The shredded potato is a traditional dish that's usually over done but this restaurant puts an amazing spin on it. Not only it is served cold and to perfection, but the spicy oil seasoning makes it a perfect dish with alcohol. 

They also have other selections of grilled short ribs and meat entrees in case you're not in the mood for noodles.

Would definitely come back when I'm craving noodles!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed my noodles. I like the concept and the playfulness of adding ingredients to my hot bowl of soup. But for some reason, I feel like I still get the bang for my buck at a pho noodle restaurant because of the quantity of ingredients. Here, you get one cherry tomato, a couple edamame beans, two slice of meat, one chicken wing, and a few other things.

Would recommend it for the novelty but for me personally, I tried it once but don't see myself going back again."}
{"text":"Finally a place that serves Yunnan Rice Noodle with flavourful soup base, all of the places I've been to in the past have been lacking in soup base.

The soup comes out in a really hot pot and you basically put in all the ingredients while the soup is still boiling, interesting concept.

I think you also get free noodle refill which sounds like a good deal, but with the amount of noodle you're already getting, trust me you're not gonna get a refill, it's like a marketing thing.

Side dishes are good and cheap, no complaint there.

Been here twice and there was always line up so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"The food is yummy, but it does contain a lot of msg. However, it is cute and worth a try. Service is also good, no complaints really. Overall, worth a try if you're craving rice noodles - the tomato soup is really good."}
{"text":"Is weather outside oh so frightful? Are you craving warmth and absolute comfort? Looking to satisfy your stomach with a bang for your buck? Well look no further because Oriental Rice Noodle truly has it all!

First off, props to this place for its super advanced seating system! It's really busy and the seating is so limited that they use advanced technology where they'll text you when a table is available. Once you enter you can put in your information on this computer tablet and you're set to go! 

Basically here you choose a soup base, protein and can add additional toppings to your liking. With unlimited noodles, the soup comes out piping hot and you can cook some of the foods inside of the bowl! The unlimited noodles factor allows you to share with a friend for a good price! 

I recommend the tomato soup, so tangy but also sweet and salty. Perfect for a noodle soup that'll surely remind you of home."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant but my second time trying cross bridge noodles. We got the tomato broth and the spicy broth song with the potato side dish. This was more than enough for two people and on top if you're still hungry... there's free refills on noodles! Overall service was good we just came at a busy time (dinner). The only thing I could potentially see go wrong in terms of customer experience is having the customers go up to the back of the restaurant to the counter to get a waiting/seat ticket. If you didn't read the sign on the door you might end up waiting along the crowd expecting a wait staff to give you a number."}
{"text":"Closer to 3.5 stars based on my experience. Few great things about this place, and some downsides as well.

This is a popular little noodle joint tucked away in a plaza with many other restaurants. The wait can be long if you go at peak hours, but luckily turnover is quick also. 

What to love:
- Boiling hot noodle soup guaranteed to make you steam (almost enough to strip), perfect on a cold day
- Very strong and flavorful broth bases 
- Filling with just 1 order (noodles are unlimited for those with bigger appetite, though I didn't find it was necessary, but keep in mind soup and filling are not unlimited)
- DIY type of experience of putting in all the ingredients yourself (making it feel like you have lots of control over customization)

Not so good:
- Possibly very long wait, especially if you're in a group
- Despite boasting no MSG, it is salty AF (aka tingling lips and chugging water for the rest of the day to quench this mysterious thirst)
- Quite pricy for what you get 

Probably a good option on a very cold day at non-peak hour and can afford the extra salt. Otherwise, venture elsewhere if you're looking for cheaper, \"healthier\" noodles."}
{"text":"I love how I am able to add the ingredients in myself. Makes me feel like I'm stirring up my own noodle potion!"}
{"text":"After eating at Dagu for a few weeks straight, my s/o and I attempted to \"try something new\" and ended up at Oriental Rice Noodle. Similar to all the other crossing the bridge noodle chains around, it offers all you can eat noodles in a bowl of boiling hot soup. Upon entering the store it already has a vastly different feel with the decor. I do want to note that there is an electronic system to get your number that will send you a text to notify when your table is ready which allows you to leave the premises.

Food 3/5
To compare this place to Dagu, the concept and majority of the foods are extremely similar. We got the kimchi and tofu soup, spicy pickled pepper soup and beef lung and tripe appetizer. The soups seem to all come with the same side dishes - corn, wood ear, fish tofu, pickled greens, minced meat, quail egg, bean curd, ham, Chinese sausage and a few slivers of pork. The only difference here between Dagu is a few of the side dishes and that pork is the only meat option. The soup should be the star of the show but unfortunately both were quite underwhelming in terms of flavor. The kimchi was quite bland and lacked any kimchi flavor until you ate an actual piece. 

The spicy broth didn't live up to our expectations either considering it was 3 peppers. The bowls the soups are served in are also quite annoying because they become narrower at the top which led me to keep having to peer in to see if I missed any food. Noodles compared to Dagu are also significantly different as they are thinner, softer and chewier. I quite liked the chewier texture but the noodles lost that quality near the end of the meal as it soaked in soup too long. 

Beef lung and tripe appetizer was also disappointing. It did look good but was completely covered in peanuts so peanut haters beware. The chili oil sauce lacked flavor and was only mildly spicy. The beef slices are tougher than Dagu but the pieces here are definitely bigger.

Service 2/5
As noted before the table system is electronic and text based. When I got the text I did as instructed which was find a staff member to which they said they weren't sure which was my table... I then showed another staff who just pointed at a random table in the back for me. Wait-wise it was quite quick for a table of 2 on a Sunday afternoon. The service is quick but that was really all I can say about it... they automatically assume you speak Mandarin (which I don't) and even when you reply in English they still reply in Mandarin. 

All in all the flavors here are lacking on all fronts and the servers don't seem to make an effort to communicate in your language. If compared to Dagu, I much prefer Dagu not only because of the soups but it seems to have more choices. I prefer that you can choose meat slices or a pork/beef bone."}
{"text":"Free refill on tasty chewy rice noodles. Side dishes are expensive for its portions and quality. I would come back again just for the noodles"}
{"text":"First time to seat rice noodles like eating hotpot. First put all the meat and vegetables in the hot soup, followed by the rice noodles. Seems like they are famous for spicy dishes. But I don't eat anything spicy, so just try their non spicy soup. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Good rice noodles! Gave me extra soup and extra bowl of rice noodles. Good value for your money and decent taste. Could be very crowded at lunch time and table for 2 is not enough space for me to eat comfortably. So go either before noon or after 2 pm. Service is decent. Would I go again: Yes."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0 

New Yunnan style noodle restaurant taking over the old Menchies location. 

The menu is fairly simple and straightforward. You pick your soup base (which starts with a chicken broth base) and then you are given a box set with 10 different ingredients consisting of various meats and vegetables. 

There is also an option to add meatballs or seafood at an additional cost. A bowl of noodles is provided separately with the broth and you can get extras for free! 

The broth is flavourful but it appears to be laced with quite a bit of msg. I definitely liked the texture of the noodles and how you can dip it into the soup. 

Overall the noodle soup is not bad but it would be nice if there was a better selection of meats to go with the noodles.

Restaurant is clean and tastefully decorated. Service is also decent and attentive."}
{"text":"Checked out this place because it was close by and the concept was pretty interesting. The menu is quite limited and there wasn't much meat to choose from. About $9 for each bowl of noodles + meat is additional $2-$3 and there is unlimited refills on noodles (however I got full just from the bowl they gave originally). Also ordered cold noodles in chili sauce but it wasn't good but the beef tripe was amazing! It was a nice new place to try, but the space is quite small and crowded."}
{"text":"It is a unique concept of serving noodles in a hot clay pot with variety of side dishes to choose from. The hot clay pot with broth practically keep my Yunnan rice noodles hot the whole time. Choose from a range  of different flavoured broth, which includes a varieties of side dishes. 

Tomato base broth - it adds flavour to the original broth and I choose the seafood package which intensified soup base. It includes shrimp, mussels and  squid meat. Combining all those ingredient gives the soup taste sweet, sour and savory. Full of flavour. When the rice noodle is added into it, the noodles absorbs the soup and each strands of noodle is wrapped in flavour. 

Even though it has unlimited noodles refills, I find one cup of noodles is enough for 1 person consumption. By the time it comes for the second bowl of noodles, there isn't enough broth. 

BBQ squid tenticles- it does have a little charred taste and smell but not quite there yet in flavour. The marinate sauce tastes spicy and sweet. 

Interesting little spot for a quick lunch or brunch, or even thouse rainy days craving for hot warm noodles!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and it was decently packed. There were about 5 tables waiting ahead of us but service was prompt and we were seated after about 15 minutes of waiting. 

The menu is straight forward but limited. For the appetizer, we tried the beef lung and tripe dish, which was served in a chilli sauce and it was actually very good. For the noodles, I ordered the pickled cabbage soup base with meatballs and my friend got the tomato soup base with beef. After tasting both soups, I think the tomato tasted better but both were very flavourful nonetheless. 

The pot that the soup comes in is hot so be careful not to burn yourself. The concept of being able to put different toppings into the pot by yourself (kinda like hot pot style) is quite attractive and makes this place unique. For the price you pay, their portions are very generous and although it was AYCE rice noodles, I could barely finish the noodles that were in my pot. 

Overall, I would recommend this place if you haven't tried it yet or if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"There was a big line so the wait took quite a while, but it was well worth it! I got the spicy soup that wasn't pickled and it was absolutely delicious. The 10 side dishes were a nice addition. 

I also got the pineapple slush wish was super yummy!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of good things about this place so I thought I'd try it.  Went at 5pm on a Sunday and it was already packed!

While I love the prospect of all you can eat noodles, I wasn't too impressed with anything I was served.  I ordered a couple skewers and just the original soup base.  I felt that everything I ate was just mediocre and nothing really stood out.  I suppose the prospect of all you can eat noodles at a reasonable price is the draw but it just didn't work for me.

This is disappointing because the presentation was amazing.  Nice hot clay (?) bowl and an assortment of sides presented in a nice looking tray.

The service also wasn't very good partly because they were so busy and partly because they didn't speak much English.

Overall, it was a fairly disappointing visit. I guess my expectations were too high."}
{"text":"I've always found Yunnan soup noodles to be interesting. Instead of having everything already cooked and served to you in one bowl, they give you all of the ingredients separately on their own tiny plates. 

I came with my parents and used the CCUE.ca coupon for 10% off, so each noodle soup order came to about $10 with tax and tips included. For this value, I was fairly satisfied and what's great is that you can also order unlimited noodle refills (for those who are big eaters)! My parents both found the standard portions filling but I ordered another 1/2 bowl of noodles :) 

I ordered the tomato soup broth, my mom ordered the sour vegetables broth, and my dad ordered the original. The tomato broth was surprisingly more sour than the sour vegetable broth, but it still tasted good and I thought it complemented the noodles well (since the noodles are pretty bland). The 10 side dishes weren't of the best quality but they all tasted fine as well: one chicken wing, one quail egg, edamame beans, one cherry tomato, one fish tofu, cloud ear fungus, one shrimp, tofu skin, garlic paste, and seaweed. All of this is then complemented with two rolls of raw hotpot-style pork and some chinese cabbage. 

Overall, I left with a warm and full belly and I'd be happy to come again with the 10% off coupon."}
{"text":"3rd time here and this time I remembered to take pictures.
Consistent in their food. Still busy as when it first opened.
Service is fast and courteous. Prices did go up a bit. Used to be $8.99 per bowl and now it's still under $10. Free refills on the noodles still in effect and there's plenty of broth to ensure that 2nd round. My friends and I left happily satisfied without emptying our wallets."}
{"text":"Really poor service. Walked in with one woman ahead of us, I expected a waiter to ask us how many our party was. Instead was ignored for several minutes even though the waiter was just standing near the cash, doing nothing, just staring at us. I signalled to him \"party of two\" and he still ignored me. Two guys came in after us and the same waiter told them to come up to get a number. I saw this and started walking up to the counter but the other guy got there first because I am 9 months pregnant and couldn't walk as fast as him. The waiter gave them their number first. We left the Warden location and went to the First Markham location. There were two families ahead of us and the waitress immediately asked how many in our party and then got me a chair to sit on, which was really nice of her. Not coming back to the Warden location."}
{"text":"Indeed interesting but I was not wow-ed by this. 
I was left satisfied but I cannot say it left a lasting impression on me. 

I got the tomato broth. The toppings are same for every broth you choose.
There's a paste that was part of the toppings that makes the broth more on the sour taste which was not bad. Should hold off adding too much of it as it might be too strong. 

Pro: unlimited rice noodles - my friend and I got another bowl of noodles to share which filled us. However they don't refill the broth"}
{"text":"As a first timer trying Yunnan rice noodles, the whole concept of the putting in your own toppings into the soup is very amusing. There are about five different types of soup and you get a plate with about 10 side dishes that ranges from chicken wing, beef, cabbage, ham, corn, quail egg and etc. The side dishes are pre-selected and I did not have any option to include or exclude anything.

The two appetizier dishes I tried were: 
--House Special Squid Tentacles Skewer (quite spicy and nothing too special)
--Cold Glass Noodles with Chili Sauce (actually really good and my favorite dish, I wished it came with more... even though it is served with Chili sauce, it was not spicy whatsoever. I even took some free refilled rice noodles to dip it into the sauce)

The two types of rice noodles that I have tried were: 
--Oriental Spicy Sauce Rice Noodle w. Meatballs 
--Oriental Original Rice Noodle w. Seafood.

Out of both the types of soup base, I would say the Oriental Original was much better than the Oriental Spicy Sauce. The sauce was very clear and I was able to taste the flavor of the soup while the spicy sauce is usually overbearing."}
{"text":"Cute interior and pots. All they serve here are rice noodles so come if you are a fan of that. I found it okay, novelty wore off when you eat past half the bowl. The noodles weren't really anything special but I do appreciate the free refills. The service is overall friendly abd restaurant has a comfy vibe."}
{"text":"We were a party of four, wait actually five. Because my friend's boyfriend came late so he had to sit on the stool tables by himself. I've ordered the oriental noodle with spicy sauce. By the time my friend arrived at about 8:15pm, I was in my hunger mode. So I started checking both the seafood and beef additions.

I didn't notice the line \"Each rice noodle set contains 10 small side dishes\" it would have been better if they have listed the small side dishes, as it contains a chicken wing, quail egg, beans, a fish tofu, tomato and some other things to add to the soup base. Note: if you order the addition for meatball, they actually give you a mixture of regular stuffed fishball and meat ball. I saw it from my friends bowl.  It was a free refill for rice noodles.  

I also ordered the house special squid tentacles and skewers. The sauce tasted pretty good!

The bowl that they served the noodle in kept my noodle piping hot throughout the meal. I recall eating quite a few imitation crab meat. The soup base tasted pretty good. The only thing is after you are done, you get quick thirsty. Overall not a bad experience."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Good for dates. Simple meal. You order the soup base & type of meat, it comes with a bowl rice noodles (refillable), a bunch of side dishes. The side dishes sometimes change for lunch and dinner. For refills of rice noodles, do it at the start and not later after your done the first bowl because the soup will get cold and the noodles won't be as soft. Service; its good, they understand English but they don't speak much of it. I usually order the tomato soup base with lamb, and it's good."}
{"text":"Finally have time to write some reviews. Let's start with this place. This is my 2nd time here with my friends. At first, they got this somewhat intuitive table booking system at the door. You simply have to \"sign in\" and just wait. The restaurant itself is quite small, though it's not really a place to hang out and have a chat as it can get quite loud. 

Onto the food, I ordered the original noodle with additional beef. The side plates came out first and then clay pot came out piping hot. Dumped everything into the pot and cook it a bit. So taste wise it's okay. Nothing too \"wow-ing\"? 

Somehow I find this place really cramped and one observation I made was the floor can be somewhat slippery, just a head's up on that to other visitors."}
{"text":"The spicy is too much for me, as the soup is real hot from the bowl. I normally get a non-spicy base while my dad gets a spicy base, and I just transfer some soup over to my bowl. The Tom Yong Gong is real sour... not a fan. They also have lots of locations - so go to whichever one is close to you!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday night so it was pretty busy. There is a machine by the door for you to enter in your info and the # of people. Once a table is ready you'll receive a text message and phone call letting you know. On the list there were 5 people ahead of us and we waited 30mins. It didn't feel long because we just used that time to walk around the plaza. 

My bf and I both ordered the original broth and he ordered seafood and meatballs as extras. The 10 small dishes came out first, followed by the boiling soup. The broth was flavourful and there was a perfect amount of everything for me because I was full afterwards. Like other reviews, the noodles here were good and had a nice chewiness to it. The meat and fish balls were interesting because they were stuffed with meat and I wasn't expecting that. Overall, It was a fun experience assembling the noodle soup together and the food was good. Perfect for a cold day~"}
{"text":"You really can't beat value for price at this place. Really interesting concept - your choice of soup and meat served in a hot stone bowl. Then you get 10 ingredient dishes including more meat that you can add into the soup. Noodles are unlimited although you get quite a bit to begin with. Kind of like hotpot...but not?  I have a bit of a love for noodles so I did really enjoy it. $45 for 4. Cheaper than fast food!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars noodle restaurant. The soup base is basically MSG and salt. Toppings are okay, environment is good, side dish is cheap. Totally cost 40 for 2, but we ordered 4 side dishes. Not coming back."}
{"text":"First Impressions
===============
Interesting decor, cozy, smells great, clean.

Tip, go to the bar table to get a table #.  The host/server may or may not tell you about this crucial step in table reservation.

Food
=====
Ordered the Spicy Signature Noodle and the Signature (not spicy).

The Noodle comes deconstructed as you see from all the photos that people have posted.  The ingredients come first and then a literally boiling bowl of broth is served  toyou and you to add the ingredients, meat, and the noodles yourself.

The food and ingredients seemed pretty simple.  The broth was tasty!  So when you mix everything together you get a good hearty bowl of noodles :).

Overall I'd say it was a fun experience and I went back a second time with family.

Would I come back?
=================
Yes, I think once in a while this will be a restaurant that calls me back.  The broth and noodles are done well and that alone will be calling me back for more !"}
{"text":"3.5/5
Was never a big fan of rice noodles until I tried this one I kind of like their  soup base and the noodle is not bad pretty chewy it's pretty cute that you get a tray of stuff that you can dump in yourself rather than it all mixed in already when it gets to your table the idea of unlimited rice noodle is cool but I assume that a lot of people cannot finish the first Bowl the last thing I should mention is the wait at this place was kind of crazy. To wait like 30 minutes to get a table but they do have this I guess cell phone text message waiting system which is good so they text you when you when the table is ready"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and generally, it was an okay experience. This place has been in my bookmarks for a little while and I CAN FINALLY CROSS IT OFF MY LIST w00t w00t!

Anyways, I was absolutely shooked by how they presented the meals. It is kind of like a hot pot rice noodle dish, but not really? LOL I think that is the best way I can describe it. You basically pick a noodle dish first (I chose the Oriental Spicy Sauce Rice Noodle). They then bring you a tray that's filled with a variety of different things to put inside this small cauldron-like pot. ((Lowkey felt like a witch while I put my food inside this pot eeeeeHHEEEHEHEEH.)) You can put in the ingredients one by one, but because I knew the soup wasn't going to be hot for too long, I felt the urge to dump everything into the pot all at once (which kind of defeats the whole hot pot concept ish but that's just what I think lawl). Also, I think this is worthy of mentioning. Although the whole tray set up was a rather interesting concept, it took up way too much damn space on the table. The table is already small enough so adding all these little trays and this and that really leaves you with little to no room left. As a result, you are kind of forced to dump everything in to create more space on the table. 

Taste wise, it is okay I guess. Nothing really stands out. It just tastes like rice noodle in a spicy soup base with some mediocre tasting ingredients LOOOL. Honestly. I think the coolest thing about this place is the whole \"Hotpot Rice Noodle Dish But Not Really\" concept (that's what I would like to call it : D) Oh, another thing, they have a free noodle refill (which I took advantage of even though I was full because why the fk not FREE!!!). Apparently, they used to have really small portions of noodles and people complained so it's good they are trying to counteract that. 

Would I come again?
Most likely not.. I think the meal was around like $10 ish which isn't bad but yeah mates I think I would spend the extra $10-19 dollars on an AYCE hotpot place. At least there I can experience the true hotpot meal with an \"endless\" supply of orders for whatever ingredient I want.

**i lied; i come here quite often HAHAHHAAHAHAH"}
{"text":"When there's ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT noodle, what could you not like about it? Maybe the wait for a table? But fear not, with their electronic check-in system, where you enter you phone number, they text and call you when your table is ready. So while you're waiting, you could totally multi-task and do some shopping at the Shoppers and T&T nearby.

I loved the selection of noodles and the different soup flavours that they offer. I had the curry coconut soup, which I felt was a bit bland, the curry and the coconut flavour could have been stronger in comparison to the tofu kimchi soup. That tofu kimchi soup was super LEGIT, that kimchi flavour in the soup... OMG... it was very good; also, if you are a vegetarian, this soup is a decent option. Which brings me to say, they don't really offer any vegetarian options in their soup bases. 

Aside from that, service was very attentive and the amount of time I had to wait to get my refill of noodles was reasonable. I love how hot the refill noodles are, after I added those noodles to my bowl, my bowl started steaming--pretty awesome, I'd say!"}
{"text":"I find the Chinese noodles, mixian, are becoming a hit lately, alot of them have been opening for awhile now.. 

I think these are one of the few that originated, second time here, so the mixian is unlimited to order once you finish your initial bowl...cost around $8.75-12, depending on if you add extra toppings to ur order... 

They have a few appetizers, which appears to be quite pricey, approx. $5.5-9, for appetizers...the bowl isn't that far of a price difference...it would be better, if they had appetizers at a lower price point with a smaller plate. Not really suppose to fill you up with an appetitizer. 

I ordered one appetizer,  $7.95, and a bowl with beef toppings...I wasn't able to finish the appetizers cuz it was quite big for one person.  It's probably meant to be shared...

My bill came to around $25 with tax, for one person, which is pricey for lunch or dinner...for noodles...I'm sure Ramen or Pho would not be this price point even if I ordered one appetizer, like spring rolls or kaarage chicken. 

Anyway, a place I may come back if I'm craving for mixian noodles..."}
{"text":"Gotta love a place that offers chewy noodles!

So you basically order the soup base you like with any additional toppings you want, but it comes with toppings already (check photo to see the tray). And noodles are unlimited so you can order more if needed, but 1 is usually good for me. It's about the same portion as ramen. 

For apps, give the cold glass noodles in chili oil a try! Not the best for digestion because it's a lot of oil, but it's very delicious in the brothy sauce. and it's not actually that spicy for those wondering. My friends who do not do spice can eat this no problem!

For the noodle soups, I love the tomato soup base. I think it's lovely! Very comforting and hot so it's great for a cold winter day. The soup is savoury, sweet and just a little tart which makes it quite appetizing. 

I like coming here with a small group. I think any group larger than 4 and you're looking to wait a while as they seem to get packed quite often. Food comes really quickly though!  Or just give them a call ahead and see if they're busy :)"}
{"text":"Came here with family for dinner. They serve Yunnan (crossing the bridge) noodle as their specialty. You get to choose your broth. I got the coconut flavored one. Comes with 10 sides and the rice noodle.
The broth comes boiling hot, to which you add the sides and noodles and you eat. The noodles are all you can eat, however sides are extra if you want more.

The noodle was decent for the price, however I didn't find anything special about it. Good if you wanna something to fill yourself up.
Service was decent. Ambience was good.

Note: you will not see Crossing the bridge noodle anywhere on the menu. It's just the name of the noodle."}
{"text":"The seating is not the most comfortable, but the food is good. I am impressed with the tomato soup base that is served piping hot! I like the rice noodles (a bit thinner than the HK style) and the 3 slices of beef/etc. don't turn hard/dry after being in the soup for a long time. The 10 \"side dishes\" include 3 slices of meat, pickled veg & some meat sauce, corn, 3 cherry tomato halves, wood ear, fish tofu, 1 shrimp, 1 spam/ham? , quail egg and bean curd sheet - ie. not a lot BUT still a big portion of noodles that left me very full. 

The duck tongue in mala sauce was not bad, served with a side of seaweed salad.

I thought I read on the menu that said No MSG? but apparently the spicy soup had quite a bit of it... so overall 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"We are often in the area for grocery shopping, and decided to stop by for lunch. This restaurant has a simple yet charming presentation of its noodles and sides. I ordered the original broth with seafood. At first glance, it doesn't look like the bowl comes with a lot of substance, but there was plenty of mussels, shrimp, and other assorted seafood at the bottom. I probably shouldn't have added all of the noodles in, as it ended up being a huge portion when combined with all the side dishes. I wish we had come on a colder day, as this meal will surely warm you up. 

The interior is decorated nicely, but it isn't very big, and we had to wait around fifteen minutes on a Saturday afternoon. Nonetheless, I would come back to try their other broths."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night, it can actually get quite busy, but the turn-around and service is fast so it should be okay. This place has a selection of soup bases for the rice noodle & toppings (+ option of extra toppings for $), and then some other snack items.

I ordered the Spicy Soup noodles and a Chili Chicken. You assemble the soup noodles yourself, throwing everything from the toppings tray into the hot soup. The Spicy Soup is spicy and salty, and quite tasty. The Chili Chicken was quite good too, with peanuts and sesame I think.

Price is reasonable, service is alright, and the food comes out quick."}
{"text":"The few times I've come here, I've gone on an off-time, and so I've never had to wait (unlike some other people's experiences). The servers are pretty efficient, so once you fill out the order sheet, they come by and take it.

Now, to the food. I liked the chewy noodles, and how the soup is boiling hot so that the meats get cooked immediately. The soup is supposed to be MSG-free, but it is super salty, and the sides that they give you (processed meats) probably has some form of MSG. I wish they would give better veggie and meat sides, though, to round off the noodles and soup."}
{"text":"Visited this place near closing around 9pm on a Thursday night. They close 10pm weeknights and I believe on the weekends they close at 10:30-11:00pm. First off, it was pretty packed, however, we were immediately seated. We got the menu and began choosing. Now i've been to Dagu Rice Noodles and MiMi noodles, so my review will be solely comparing oriental against the two. Super fast service! Tea and menus were placed down right when we sat down. It was good because we were freeezing! We both ordered the coconut curry soup base for $8.95. The gave us the side dishes which I absolutely thought were MUCH MUCH better than what both MIMI and Dagu offers. They gave 1 shrimp, quail egg, bamboo sheets, preserved chinese sausages, spam, pickled radish, meat sauce and cherry tomatoes (see pics). Meat is the same as anywhere else, still three slivers of meat. Now here is the major difference between the three places. I don't like the noodles at oriental. Maybe it was just my dish, but it was overcooked and soggy like. It wasn't a nice chewy texture like Dagu's. Their soup base was good, but the noodles threw it off. 

We also ordered their pig ears ($4.99) and their salted seaweed ($4.99). The seaweed one was just not my cup of tea.. blahh. The pig ears were delicious though! 

Another thing I didn't like was how the servers all assumed we spoke mandarin and would just speak to us in mandarin, despite us replying in English. Oh well, they did split the bill for us, so that's a plus I guess!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch around 12:30 on a Friday, it's busy but not too long of wait as turnover was quite quick. Staff is abrupt and service may be lacking a bit, but if you're just looking for some hot noodle soup on a cold day it's worth a shot. Yunnan rice noodle is personally my favourite of the rice noodles, so this place is a hit for me. You get a paper sheet where you can choose your soup base and any add ons you'd like to the standard ten piece side dish and noodles. Unlimited rice noodle for 8.99 is a pretty good deal, although for lunch I couldn't eat more than their initial portion, which is quite big to begin with. The ten side dishes come with the meat raw in the centre (there is only 3 slices, so if you're a big eater you might want to order the additional meat in the $2-3 range for an add on).  The soup comes in a boiling hot pot and the noodles come separate and you throw whatever you want of the side dishes and the noodles in the pot, mix it all together and enjoy. 
Would definitely come back to try other soup bases!"}
{"text":"atmosphere: rather nice, not that big of a room though 
food: the food quality is a bit cheap, a type of hot pot style. the noodle is kind of like Ramen lol;
the soup at the end of the meal is pretty good though 
price: this is what got it 4 stars - UNLIMITED NOODLE REFILLS?! ok sure it may be cheap noodles, but as many as you want? you could literally bring your entire family and only buy one bowl and order 10 refills. each bowl is ~9$, so it's not that bad anyway 
service: some employees don't even understand English that well, also you have to ask for refills / bill ; they don't come to you

rating: ****/*****
again, what got it four stars was because of the unlimited noodles (pricing)
kinda average in all other aspects though"}
{"text":"Our Orders: Pickled Cabbage & Vegetable Broth (my fave), Spicy Broth & Original Broth (somewhat bland).

Pros: 
+ Food: The overall favorite was the pickled broth. It was a little sour & tangy. The spicy broth only had the overwhelming spice taste to it and the original broth seemed lacking in comparison. I also liked that the noodles were ayce

Cons
- Service: The waitresses actually seem surprised when you get a noodle refill and come across as rude. That wasnt cool."}
{"text":"My date introduced me to the world of chewy rice noodles and boy, was it different! As I shakily walked through the door on a chilly night, I was immediately bathed in a steamy warmth filled with the scent of savoury spices. Glancing to my right, I was instantly mystified by the iPad. I turned to my date, \"Technology? In a Chinese restaurant? Whoa!\" 

\"It's to get into queue for seats,\" he says.

Like a fat kid in a candy store, I excitedly started pushing the buttons in hopes of burning a few extra calories before the big meal. Using the machine was completely unnecessary as there really wasn't a line. But I imagine during those busy nights, this queuing system would be very efficient.

We were quickly sat down and given the menu: soup base, unlimited noodles, 10 small side dishes, meat. Cool. I closed my eyes and let fate decide what I will eat that night. Tomato soup base and lamb it is!

The waitress brought over our food with the side dishes. I poured everything into one bowl as elegantly as I could. As my hunger took over, I forgo my ladylike persona and threw on my eating cap. The first chomp of noodles sent me into a heavenly daze. My eyes glazed over. Mmmm, so much flavour. I looked over at my date's bowl and he offered up his food too - the man knows how to impress a girl. Mmmm beef. Happily, I continued slurping up the food until my stomach sent the stop signal. As my brain began to function again, each bite got more and more salty and less and less satisfying. Dang, I let myself go. I looked down - oil spots covered my shirt.

Slightly embarrassed, I glanced up to see whether my date was still there. \"Wanna split a second helping of noodles? It's free,\" he says. 

\"Heck yeah!\" I replied thinking what luck that there was comfort food AND a great guy. 

Though the food is a bit pricey for what you get and you'll come out extremely dehydrated from the massive amount of salt you'll happily ingest, this is a decent place for some casual comfort food on a cold night - especially if you have someone to pig out with! I say, give it a try but don't expect mind blowing food."}
{"text":"Unlimited rice noodles and their extra noodles came hot! I would highly recommend getting their Tomato noodle soup. Their Curry noodle soup was too spicy and lacked the curry taste. They just added chilli oil into their curry soup. Their side dishes already comes with pork meat so there was no need to order additional meats unless you want something else.

Their service was a bit slow even though it was not busy at all."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night. It looked very busy, but the wait was not that long; maybe around 15 minutes.

The concept is simple: you have an option of soup base and can add extra meat to it. They serve you a tray of side dishes, a bowl of boiling soup, and a bowl of rice noodles. You also have the option of adding extra noodles for free, although just the original serving of noodles was enough for me.

The soup tasted great and stayed hot for a long time, so if you finished your first bowl and were to get an extra serving of noodles it would still be hot by then.

The bill for 3 people came around $50. We ordered a bowl of noodles for each of us, and two appetizer dishes."}
{"text":"I came during a busy time and waited for 15 mins. It wasnt worth the wait because one of the cooks carelessly left a piece of plastic from packaging in the soup..... gross!! Glad I caught it before I swallowed otherwise I would have gotten sick."}
{"text":"The cross-bridge noodle tastes good. But the best thing in this restaurant is the noodle can be refilled unlimited times until you feel full without extra cost!"}
{"text":"I went there total of 2 times and both times I had to wait for at least 20-30 mins for a table. First time was a group of 6 and second time was group of 3. I noticed that their seating plan of the restaurant is a bit inefficient because they have 3 large tables in the centre of the restaurant and they seated two people on the end leaving two seats in the centre empty. In conclusion, 6 seats were wasted. (I believe no one would want to go sandwich in between right?) Anyway, the food was not overly good, I would say decent. The side dishes were slightly different each time. The clay hot does keep the soup hot even until your meal is finished which was very nice. It's $8.49 if you don't get any extra toppings and it's $3 additional for each topping: seafood, beef, lamb etc.. Lastly, I have to mention this because it was quite difficult to order. They gave each table a piece of paper to order but it doesn't have \"quantity\" or \"which order wants the extra topping\".  So we were really confused on how to mark our order on the paper (it's literally just a bullet beside each item and we all wanted the original one; some wanted seafood and some wanted extra beef). We tried to list it our way but the staff was confused (lol). I would recommend either change the layout of the menu or just give each person one to order. I think the restaurant is still new and there are improvements to be made to make it more efficient. Overall, the staff was very friendly and they respond very quickly."}
{"text":"Interesting way to serve soup noodle - in a big hot pot to keep your soup hot. Soup taste okay. All You can eat rice noodle suitable for people who are very hungry I suppose. But the toppings do not worth the price they are asking..i"}
{"text":"Would have liked stronger ventilation.  Good portion.  Bottomless rice  noodles.  Nice presentation.  Nice decor.  Good price.  No combo with  drinks  though. If you can't eat spicy,  there are only two choices for you."}
{"text":"After constantly seeing this place pop up on IG in my social circle, I decided to give it a shot.
I went with a group of 5 on a Friday night, we were seated with 15mins but the table was a little crowded after all our food came. I recommend coming in multiples of 2 for a better experience.
We ordered noodles in the curry, original, tomato and spicy soup. It was a very fun experience that was like suedo hot pot - you are given a boiling pot of soup with some semi-raw toppings and bottomless noodles. You can opt to have additional meats or seafood in the original soup.
We also ordered the spicy lung and tripe, as well as squid tentacles.
Overall, I loved the food. However, all of our soups except for the original had a funny soup pickle taste, but some of us didn't even add in the pickle topping. So the original soup was hands down the best flavour. I also don't recommend adding additional meats to the soup base, you really door need it - the toppings it comes with is plentiful. I missed out on getting more refills of the noodles because there was way too much food.
Price wise, out tab came out to $17/person after everything, but next time I think the basic $8.99 will be plenty for your everyday meal...which is not bad considering you get unlimited noodles.
I highly recommend, but most note that you will smell like a round of hot pot after you leave."}
{"text":"We came to a full house! It was really good, but the soup base that I got was kind of a disappointment flavor wise. The spice level on the curry coconut wasn't existent. No wifi either, but the experience was unique and definitely worth the try. All you can eat noodles, pricing isn't bad, roughly ten dollars per person. I wouldn't go again, as the pots after they are done are placed on the ground in the back, leading to insects. Friend supposedly found a roach in her bowl and they waitress asked if she was sure..."}
{"text":"My gf and I both give this place 3 stars.. meaning we wouldn't recommend it, don't crave it, but if someone wants to come.. we would return..

The idea of this place is pick a broth.. add additional protein for additional cost, and then unlimited noodles...

Bill for 2 ppl was about $40 including tip for dinner..

She went with the fish broth and I went with the Pork Bone broth..

The idea seems great and interesting!!

BUT, the broth gets cold really quickly.. so unlimited noodles doesn't mean nothing..

Pretty good business model tho! I wouldn't return but this place has good hype and fast turnover of customers.. 

2.5 to 3 stars.. 2.5 cuz a bit too much MsG.."}
{"text":"We have been here about three times and each time we are pleased with our visit. We were lucky enough that each time we got a table right away. We always ordered the basic broth and it comes with a lot of items to add plus the noodles. It's a good size because I was full at the end. Price is also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Oriental Rice Noodle is located near Steeles and Warden Avenue in the crowded T&T plaza.  If you're planning to go here, don't go right in the middle of lunch or dinner time if you don't want to wait forever for a parking spot.  Same goes for the restaurant itself - it was getting very busy both times I went, at peak hours.

How it works is you select your soup base and you get all-you-can-eat rice noodles with it - and they're very good too.  Your order comes with a choice of meat (most are in the soup already).  It also comes with ten mini-side dishes, which can vary from day to day (some examples include: ham, fish tofu, edamame, chicken wing, etc; see photo).  You can also use your side dishes for salt or soy sauce once you use them.  Warning: The soup is VERY hot when you get it.  This also means you should probably put the raw meat they give you into the soup right away so you can cook your meat.  Edit: My soup was VERY watered down last time and had very little actual flavour to it, which is very disappointing.  After we left, my girlfriend told me hers was very watered down too.

The restaurant is very clean and well kept.  A nice touch is that there's a taller table along the window for people who like that sort of thing.  They seem to have plenty of staff members working and willing to help you.  Edit: Service is a little shotty.  When I told them my soup was watered down, the initial waitress had zero idea what I meant (she actually pointed to my water...) and went to get someone else when she realized I didn't want more water.  The next person didn't seem to want to do anything for me and, to get her point across, decided it'd be best to talk to my girlfriend who could speak her first language instead.  So they aren't really the best at understanding English.  Yikes.

They do take debit or credit card.  Most of the bowls are around $8.75 (before tax and tip, side dishes and AYCE noodles come with your meal), then plus another $2-3 depending on your choice of meat, so it's of great value, for sure.

If you're a fan of rice noodles, give this place a try.  Edit: Hopefully my last visit was a bit of an off day because otherwise, I'm not sure this place is worth going to.

Edits: Much of my review was changed based on my last visit, from my previous review.  II'm not doing a full updated review because the restaurant itself didn't change, just my experience."}
{"text":"The 1 star knock off was solely because of the poor service, otherwise, I would give it 5/5 stars. 

We (a party of 3) arrived at the restaurant at 7:30pm on a Saturday night and there was already a huge lineup. The place is actually quite small, but props to them for having a self electronic check-in system where you can put down your name and phone number and they will text you when there is a table available. It was a good 30 minute wait but we really didn't want to try other places nearby as we were all craving for some hot rice noodles. But I think next time I would put my name/number down first and then shop at Shoppers or T&T while I wait. 

As soon as I got the text, I went inside the restaurant in hopes that the host would call out our line#. There were 4 waiters that night and none of them came near the door to greet us. I had to wave down one of the waiters to tell them that I got a text about a table being ready and then she just told us to go sit at an empty table. Were we supposed to just grab the empty table ourselves? I was so confused. 

There was a paper menu and a pen when we sat down on the table and all you had to do was check off the type of soup base that you wanted, plus any extra meats and appetizers/drinks. It is great, but what a waste of paper! Perhaps customers could order it via an ipad or the waiters could just write it down. These self-order paper menus are definitely not environmentally friendly. 

We ordered 3 different rice noodle soup bases and an appetizer: Original ($8.99), Tomato Sauce ($9.49), and Curry Coconut Sauce ($9.49) and a Beef Lungs & Tripes with Chili Oil ($6.99) as an appetizer. The soups came quickly after we ordered and they were boiling hot! I absolutely LOVE that it is boiling which makes it is even better on a cold winter night. It certainly warms your soul. The meal comes with a tray of many different side dishes that you are supposed to put into the soup. Everything is delicious! The soup is so hot that it cooks the raw sliced pork that they give you in a minute. The noodles are chewy. I just LOVE the entire meal. The most important thing for me is that they don't put any MSG in their soup base. If you want a clean, clear light broth, the original is great! I sure feel healthier after eating it. The tomato sauce base is a little sour and the more you drink the soup, the more hungry you get! The curry coconut sauce is only a little spicy and there's only a very faint taste of the curry coconut. It is definitely not strong like Laksa, but I loved that it gives the soup a subtle taste. 

Here's the best thing about this restaurant: If you're still hungry after a bowl of rice noodles and if there's still soup left in your bowl, you can get a refill of the noodles FOR FREE. Definitely an all-you-can-eat rice noodles kind of joint. 

The beef lungs & tripes with chili oil is quite good, a little numbing spicy and personally I find it quite salty for me. However, it is very flavourful and it goes super well with the rice noodle meal. 

Overall, my family and I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. We can't wait to go back! A must-eat in the winter :)"}
{"text":"INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT:

1) Choose your soup base. Each soup base comes with a side of 10 small dishes which includes three rolls of pork(?) and a bowl of noodles. It's basically a personal hotpot.

2) Optional: choose some extra meat. Again, some meat is already included. Each add on of meat is $2.99 and comes with ~six pieces - six rolls of lamb/beef/pork, six meat balls (meat stuffed fish balls and beef balls). The included dishes are definitely enough for the average person. Extra meat is overpriced. And is cooked for you in your soup based. Unfortunately for me, this meant my lamb slices were overcooked. 

3) Obtain your side dishes. Don't snack! These are for garnishing your soup. The two unidentifiable dishes are meat sauce and minced cabbage.

4) Obtain your soup base/extra meat. It comes boiled in a hot stone bowl. Use the heat to cook the raw meat you were given in the side dishes. Basically just throw in all the other dishes after.

5) Eat! If your sitting at the booth seats, you're at the perfect height to burn your chin on the stone bowl.

6) Order more noodles. Noodles are unlimited refill.

You're welcome. Because I was confused af.


3.5  Good place and good value for just the main course. Would go again for just the noodle bowl. Noodles have a good chewiness to them. Can't go wrong with original soup base. Spicy pickled pepper sauce has good flavour to it as well. We got an oyster omelette to share. It's decent tasting, but a tiny portion and nothing special. 

They have a reservation machine at the front door that's neat. Enter your name/number and party size and they'll text you when your table is ready."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon with my bf, which is really packed with people. We got the original and tomato broth. The toppings are same for every broth you choose, but you can add extra toppings or upgrade your meat to a higher grade. The broth is so-so, and I think the original is better than tomato. But if you want a warm bowl of noodles in this cold weather, definitely you should give it a try."}
{"text":"I love trying new things and this was something different. Your choice of soup base and it comes with condiments ( ham, corn, beef, and etc) that you add into the soup. You can also get unlimited portions of rice noodle. For extra charge you can add toppings like beef, meatballs, and seafood. They're super generous with the toppings they give you. I love the meatballs because they have filling inside. The customer service isn't the best but once I eat the food I forget how bad the service really was. I also don't recommend the mango slush to anyone! It tasted like water.

Method of payment is only debit and cash."}
{"text":"If you are hungry and want something warm and very filling, this is the place. All the soup noodles are safe bets, and they all come with unlimited rice noodles. Each noodle bowl comes with a selection of different toppings, which were all very good. The setting of the restaurant was very cute and fitting for the vibes, and had nice chairs and tables. This is a definite must visit!"}
{"text":"I really love Bridege Rice Noodles. They use a special bowl that can keep the temperature at more than 100c degree.  So the soup is super hot. When the soup arrives at your table, it still boiling with the vapour and bubble. You should put all the meat and dishes in the hot soup right away. It will cook the thin cut sliced beef. Also their noodle are refillable although i never refill. Strongly recommend the sour veggie soup."}
{"text":"This is one of many locations in its chain serving chewy rice noodles with customizable soup base and customizable ingredients. I find myself gravitating towards it especially during cold winter days, where there's nothing better than seeing a boiling stone pot of noodle soup in front of you.Their noodle are always made fresh and chewy texture always satisfies my noodle craving. 

Every soup noodle comes with an entire tray of ingredients that you can add to your noodle soup based on your preferences. The ingredients include: lamb, fish cake, shrimp, cherry tomato, luncheon meat, chopped pickled cabbage, soy bean paste,  corn, tofu skin, cured chinese sausage, and a quail egg. 
The first time I went there I paid extra to add seafood to my standard soup base, only to realize that I could barely finish the ingredients that already come with every order.

 I recently tried their new pickled cabbage and minced pork soup base and was very happy with it! Some of their side dishes are also tasty. The ones I've tried are the BBQ squid legs and beef tongue. 

This is definitely a unique Chinese noodle restaurant chain that had done very well with the DIY rice noodle soup concept. This place gets quite busy during during meal times so get ready to wait!"}
{"text":"Very interesting place! So before you even walk into the restaurant itself, right beside the first door, there's a touch pad for you to register yourself. MEANING: register how many people for your table, your name, and phone number and you'll be getting a text for you wait number. SO COOL , RIGHT!?!!!?!!! 

I was amazed at that feature already. When you get seated, you'll get a piece of paper in which you will place your order. That is essentially the menu. Their noodles are unlimited. YES! YOU READ IT RIGHT. UN-L-I-M-I-T-E-D!!! SO that means you can order as many noodles as you want. They're fresh and hot to serve! 

I especially liked their tomato based soup with their 10 ingredients which comes in side dishes for you to put into you clay pot of soup and noodle. You can have a choice to put all 10 or not. This leaves you for room of creativity ! 

I also really liked their cold shaved noodle with chili sauce. Yums!! Definitely will come here to try it again... Maybe curry this time :) 
Each bowl is around $8.50-10.50"}
{"text":"This place is pretty fun to eat at. I love these interactive places- the ones where you need to do a little something too (although its not too too involved here). 

The noodles, of course, are all you can eat, but in most cases I dont think you will need more than one refill. 

Tasty broth flavours (I really like the curry) and good prices."}
{"text":"** 2.5 ** Star

The GOODs:

Value - For $8.99, you can get unlimited noodles refilled. 9 different standard toppings with great varieties even though portion is small. Overall was fresh. 

Service - very prompt and friendly. 

The BADs:

MSG - the broth had lot of MSG. I got quite thirsty afterward. 

Cleanliness - all the toppings were prepared in advanced. I found a tiny hair on one of the topping dishes. Not on the food but on the side. Not sure if they put cover on food to ensure nothing drop on it. 

Additional meat toppings cost $2 extra but the quality was little. 

The BBQ skewer was expensive for the amount I got and it tasted OK."}
{"text":"The thing that caught my attention with this place, as is probably with many others, is their cute little 10 mini side dish presentation. This place itself is not super interesting but with cold weather around the corner, soup and noodles is always a good idea.

Located right in the corner of the plaza on Warden/Steeles, its conveniently located with plenty of parking available (but this plaza is busy 247 considering all the other restaurants and supermarket there). 

Once inside, the restaurant might be a bit smaller than you would expect, but not to the point that its elbow to elbow. Their menu is pretty straight forward; you choose your base (original, spicy, tomato or something) then any extras like beef or seafood ($ extra). All the noodles comes with 10 mini side dishes that you literally just put in your bowl of noodles. Dishes include corn, ham, fish tofu, cherry tomatoes, etc. For first timers here you might wanna try their original base first and then venture out with the other bases for comparison. The soup and noodles come in a separate bowl with the soup in a steel bowl and the noodles on the side. Careful though especially for younger children; the soup comes SUPER hot. 

Prices are very friendly. With the original at $8.99 a bowl, for two people your bill will just be under $20 (tips not included yet).

Oh. And did I mention noodles have FREE refills? yup."}
{"text":"How it works is you pick a soup base for $8.99, comes with unlimited noodles and 10 mini side dishes which you dump into your boiling hot soup. Side dishes include a chicken wing, a fish cake, edamme beans, dried tofu, tomato, egg, shrimp, preserved veggie, minced pork, and fungi. Love the presentation of these side dishes. Then you have the option of selecting a type of meat you want to go with your soup base. I had the beef (+$2.99) - comes with 2 pieces of raw beef in the center of your tray, and a bunch of cooked beef pieces mixed into your soup already. Not bad for what you get. I had the original soup base, and it was flavorful.

Only thing I didn't like was you smell like hot pot after."}
{"text":"This place always seemed to be busy so we decided to give it a try. Interesting concept but nothing special to be honest. The little sides that they give you are clearly frozen items (when mine came it was still cold and hard), and didn't taste fresh at all. Soup was also quite salty as I kept asking for refills on water. However what's good about this place is their unlimited noodles (noodles weren't bad!)"}
{"text":"Menu is quite limited at Oriental Rice Noodle. The main item is Cross the Bridge Noodle from Yunnan Cuisine. You order the soup base and you will be served with some toppings that you can added into the boiling hot broth.

The best thing here is you can have free additional noodle. The broth did stayed really hot for a long time so you can order the extra noodle either when you placed your initial order or a little later if you still hungry.

There are also some snacks and side dish to choose from. 

Service is prompt and friendly. The decor is nice and the restaurant itself is quite spacious.

Not a bad choice if you have some noodle cravings when you are in the area. Since sharing the same parking lot as the busiest T&T supermarket, you can imagine how hectic the parking situation can be on the weekends.

Cash or Debit only"}
{"text":"Tip: you can order extra meat on the side, the little boxes on the bottom of each soup flavour, you can add additional lamb or beef"}
{"text":"Mixed time. 

I am a picky fattie rather than a foodie. Yes, you get unlimited noodles- that is a plus, but minimal protein. All in all, it has potential to be great if they served better side protein dishes to go along. 

Waiting to get a seat, I wondered why some girl eating the noodles looked so sad. Maybe she broke up with her byfriend? But it was because of the use of clay pots.

The plus of clay pots is the soup stays boiling hot, but the negative is that customers eat slowly or let their noodles cool down before they take a bite. This also causes arriving customers to wait a LONG time. 
I too was in agony like the sad girl, from the piping hot noodles and ate longer than I expected."}
{"text":"I'm going to be generous with the rating as they are generous with their unlimited refills on noodles! The whole concept of deconstructed noodles and assembling it yourself is really fun experience. But once it's mixed, it's nothing more than regular Yunnan rice noodles. But I have to say, I am really happy with the 10 side dishes they offer: beef, lettuce, bean curd, quail egg, ham, chicken wing, corn, pickled cabbage, omasum, and meat sauce! 

My boyfriend ordered the Original and I got the Spicy soup base. Out of both, the Oriental Original was better because you could taste the flavour profile much more. Regardless, everything was tasty and didn't disappoint but it wasn't something I would crave for more. I do appreciate that the urn keeps the heat, it stayed relatively warm throughout my whole meal. 

The only downside is that there seems to be online two pieces of meat provided in the set of side dishes. There's a limited selection of meat at an additional cost of ~$2-3 that is added into the soup already. It's definitely something to try out once but I'm not sure if I would frequent it often at their price point. I'd rather hop to Deer Garden for more ingredient selection!"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of noodles and soup, you're in for a treat!  The noodles here are the perfect texture and the best thing is - *mic drops* there are unlimited refills.  Who doesn't love that?  I always have one refill (at least because I have a big appetite).  There are a number of side dishes that come with your noodles.  If you want more than two slices of meat, you can order it at an extra cost.  I think the two slices are enough, though.  The process before eating is to add your side dishes in the boiling hot soup, then add the noodles.  Wait a minute and then voilà!  Your food is ready to devour.

The tomato soup base is amazing.  I have also tried the original (which is pictured below) and the curry coconut.  Both are good as well.  Tomato is the best for my personal taste, though.  

Service is pretty good, my tea is refilled and food arrives promptly.  No complaints here.

Side story - I once lost my pandora bracelet here and an employee kept it for me til the end of the day when I was able to pick it up.  She wouldn't except payment from me.  The people here are very kind.  

I am here every other week and I highly recommend coming here :)  There have been a few other Yunnan Noodle restaurants opening in the area but this one to me is the best."}
{"text":"This restaurant really tried to fit in as many tables as possible into its limited space. It didn't bother me too badly, but I'm worried about accidents happening in the future. The menu itself is also quite limited, but this restaurant is for noodles, so I'm not surprised.

I ordered the spicy soup base while my friend ordered the regular one. Mine was spicier than expected, but I really enjoyed the set up of the noodles. The tray with things to add in is quite cute, but also takes up a lot of space on the small tables. It looked better on Instagram than reality since everything was so tight. My friend's regular soup base was kinda flavourless. It wasn't really even salty. I wouldn't recommend it.

Part of the allure of this place is the fact that you can add unlimited noodles, but in my opinion, that's really not needed. I could barely even finish what they gave me originally. For around 10 dollars and being absolutely stuffed, I would say this was decent value for your meal. I was really surprised at how many noodles were in the pot. Be careful though; the pot is VERY hot. I accidentally burned myself trying to pick up my chopsticks. 

Service was a little below average, but considering how many people were in the restaurant and how tight the space was, I don't blame them for being a bit hurried with us. At the very least, no one was rude.

I'd recommend coming here just to try everything out, and I'd definitely return at a less busy time (if that exists)."}
{"text":"Although the place is small, the dishes are not bad. I went with my friends,.then we choose 2different flavor noodles. Both them are.good. It is a place which worth to try"}
{"text":"If you're tired of eating pho, then try the surprisingly simple yet satisfying Yunan style rice noodle soup at Oriental Rice Noodles. 

You are served a tray full of various ingredients - chicken, veggies, quail egg, edamame, rice noodles and a steaming bowl of light broth to incubate all your food. The broth was one of the tastiest I've ever had and the rice noodles were so invitingly soft and chewy. Everything was just sooo good! 

There will likely be a line up, so be prepared to wait some time before getting seated. But once you get inside, you'll be greeted with unique wall art of Yunan culture. From there, service was also quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is gimmicky in the sense that they essentially serve deconstructed bowls of noodle soup ... but it can work! This place is known for their noodle meals which come with a large, boiling bowl of soup (the broth was legit at a rolling boil when set in front of me!), add-ins separated into little bowls (corn, fish cake, minced beef, etc.), and noodles on the side. You can put in the ingredients as you desire but they're all pretty standard so you end up dumping it all into the bowl anyway. The meals also come with unlimited noodles which can be a plus for hungry patrons (no one in our table ordered more). It was fun seeing and playing with the deconstructed meal, but at the end of the day, it really was just a mediocre bowl of noodle soup that I would not have ordered otherwise (sub-par by Markham standards). I did enjoy the experience and I happily paid for the gimmick but doubt I'll be back."}
