{"text":"This was my second visit to Boccone and it was as good as the first. 

Great selection of salads and focaccia sandiwiches that are super filling.   Today I tried the pasta dishes -  3 items for less than $10.  A pretty great deal.   I had the fish with a side of gnocchi and veggies.  Fantastic.  Other members in my lunch group had the chicken and said it was delicious.  

I can't believe the number of people that they put through this place.  The line up was double wrapped around however I still had my food in no more than 2-3 minutes.  They have a team clearing tables so even at 12:30 on a Friday my group had a table to sit at.  

Fast, Friendly, Filling and GOOD!... If you're at Yonge/St. Clair be sure to check it out."}
{"text":"I've got to agree with Emma B. I walked past this place all the time but never bothered to go in. One day out of the blue I decided to take a peek and was blown away.  

They have a huge selection of pasta, salads, and prepared sandwiches. Prices are reasonable and the portions are large.  Luckily for me they have a few veggie options and their grilled veggie panini sandwich is really good.  You can mix and match sandwiches with pasta and salad side dishes and really customize your order how ever you like.

Good healthy option for a lunch under $10.

Take out or eat in.

Friendly staff and a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"My go to spot for lunch when I'm in the area. 
Personal favourite: the chicken focaccia sandwich! Yum!"}
{"text":"As good as it gets to say the least. 

I can't even remember how many times I have been to Boccone. It is a great family owned, lunch and deli restaurant where you don't compromise on time, money, quantity and most importantly quality. It is the perfect place to go if you need a quick bite, are low on cash and at the same time want a very tasty, yet substantial meal. 

The salad combos are a great option as there is always a big selection. The sandwiches vary from vegetarian to ham and cheese to Italian salami; all of them are made with authentic Italian ingredients and one of them is enough to keep you going till dinner. However, my favorite option is the pizza. For the price of 3 dollars, you can enjoy a slice made with REAL Italian mozzarella, which is actually what differentiates it from any other pizza fast-food place. The above would be my top three options but there are so many other choices including pasta options, veal and chicken sandwiches. 

Try it if you don't believe me. Boccone is the best mix of time, money, quantity and quality you'll find out there."}
{"text":"I love this place for lunch! They have a \"deli\" bar where you can see all the ready-made-foods that they serve and the food is always fresh. They do a bunch of combo platters that are delicious and price friendly along with portion friendly. They are always generous with the portions and the place is always packed around lunch, but the wait is never long. 

The food is delicious and they have wonderful sauces for you to get for the side. I go there to pick up lunch close to 2 times a week and absolutely love it. The only feedback I'd say would be for their servers to be a touch more friendly sometimes. Sometimes they are so sweet and happy to help and sometimes they seem overwhelmed and are a little short with you."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch.  Can get busy, so try to go before the rush or right after.  Salads are fresh and tasty, pizza is great, as is the pasta, and the foccacia sandwiches are delectable.  The prices not too bad, its not cheap, but not overly expensive.  The menu can be a little confusing, because there are so many choices, but once you figure it out, its really worth it.  Staff is attentive, atmosphere is also nice."}
{"text":"This place feeds about half of my school at lunchtime. They have a large number of tasty salads and mainstay Italian dishes like gnocci, lasagne, and pizza. It's not earth-shatteringly good, but for super-quick lunch stuff, it's pretty good. The service is fast and friendly, and although the lines can get pretty long, you're usually in and out in about 5 minutes. (Seriously, they have the fastest debit machine I have ever encountered.) I recommend getting the four salad combo--it's yummy, and you feel like you're eating something somewhat healthy."}
{"text":"Damn, maybe lunch price point is good but just had a capreccioso pizza there. Compared to Terroni it's an insult and garbage. They are saving money by cutting one sausage thin slice to 10 pieces, cheap cheese, bad dough oh very bad dough. This is  at Spiga next to boccone, same owner, spiga kitchen.
 Good lord I might eat pizza pizza which I don't think is not for humans and should be illegal and whoever does not think so Should cross the Atlantic for the first time. Better value for money. I don't know maybe I am an Alien but a dough that tastes like naan bread well all they care is to meet 10 $ point and who cares what those cattle eat anyway..... Maybe other dishes are great ..... Though I doubt. And I doubt If the owners eat their own food... Most Canadians don't know anything about food besides wings and burgers and these people are taking advantage. Cheap prices however, just go for drinks and appetizers......sorry"}
{"text":"Really good veil on a Kaiser sandwich! However their hours are horrible. I've only eaten there once because of it."}
{"text":"Boccone is a nice little cafe style restaurant where I've had the opportunity to have lunch on several occasions. While this establishment appears to be related to the two on the left of it, it is slightly more affordable and appears to be a lot more casual.

I personally always order the dinner special as I like having larger meals if I'm paying for one. With the dinner special I am given a choice of two salads, of which they have many, a piece of focaccia and a meat or hot dish. Personally I recommend the tuna chickpea salad. Needless to say, the number of times I've returned speaks to how much I enjoy the food.

Speaking on staff, the guy I usually pay, who appears to either be the owner or manager, has always been warm. Additionally, while this isn't exactly a sit down, fancy restaurant and you've got to serve your own water and what not, the staff is quick to direct you to an open table during busy lunch rushes and clean up once you're done.

I'll certainly be back again and again in the future."}
{"text":"I've had the pizza and orzo salad. Both were great and reasonably priced. Would go again"}
{"text":"Just started working in the neighbourhood and was told to try out this deli/pizzeria at lunch time and I'm very glad I did.  It's now my daily lunch place and I love it!

They have different daily specials - soups, pasta, pizza and sandwiches - as well as favourite items available every day (mostly salads and sandwiches).  My favourite is their chicken foccacia sandwich (chicken, red peppers, mayo and provolone) and their ravioli pasta salad...a great combo.  With a drink it usually comes to about $10.

The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and it's a great place to sit and eat - if you can find a seat!  It's a very popular place at lunch for casual diners, students on lunch as well as for quick business meetings.  So if you're coming right around 12, be prepared to line up...but don't get too disheartened as the line moves extremely quickly and is never too stressful.  That being said, I tend to get the food to go and take it back to work to avoid the crush for seats.

if you're in the area for lunch - stop in!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I haven't tried the pizza, but everything here is tasty, filling, relatively healthy, fast, fresh, and affordable. The problem: food temperature. Anything you order that is supposed to be hot, whether it's soup or breaded chicken/veal with tomato sauce is consistently lukewarm at best. This is a reliable, four star, $10 lunch spot if they can fix this problem."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for lunch! They have such good prices for the food and quantity and the staff is usually so friendly. You also get a wide range of options depending on what you're feeling like eating. Whether it was a meat and pasta combo or sandwich and salad, I always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Very reliable choice for a weekday lunch under $10. Just get in line at the counter and order to stay or to go.
I usually opt for the plate of assorted salads. You can choose 2-4 salads and they'll pile them on the plate for you. Salads range from green salad, to veggie salad (snow peas, green beans...) to pasta salads and seafood (tuna, crab...). They also usually have a choice of 3 hot pastas, 1-2 soups, several types of both pizzas and focaccia sandwiches each day. Everything is fresh and looks so good that it is usually hard to decide what to get.
This is a great option for a quick sit-down lunch or take-out. No matter how busy it seems up front, there are a lot of tables (this is one restaurant of 3 connected restaurants). In the nicer months, there is even a small patio with outside seating."}
{"text":"This will be the briefest review I write because I may have to run to the bathroom. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. Was served, with coleslaw, in a soggy sandwich. Spent the rest of the afternoon with a stomach ache. Pulled pork - never again."}
{"text":"This place is great. I go here on a regular basis for lunch and order the eggplant Parmesan plate. It's the best value lunch place in the area and has great seating outside. The salad options are great as well."}
{"text":"Very nice people. The food is okay, a bit too salty for me. I'm not that impressed with the flavour though. I guess my taste buds been spoiled by good food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Italian comfort food!

My friend showed me this place during one of our lunches since we work in the area.  It was great!

I usually get the small plate of pasta for lunch.  It's just enough to fill me and you get alittle piece of italian bread on the side.  It comes to about $4.05 that is without a drink.   The larger plate is generous and I can't finish it. 

They also have a variety of salads you can choose 1-4 types for a combo lunch as well as fresh ciabatta sandwiches that look REALLY good but I haven't tried yet. 

It's a nice little restaurant with plenty of seating as well, a lot of the suit-men go there for lunches and meetings I found lol.  

If you want to fill up on you carbs....come right in! :)"}
{"text":"Food was very good, a bit pricey (16 for a sandwich and a salad, no beverages), but service was awful. The guy who cleans the tables has never heard of the words hello, please or thank you. My coat was by my side and touching the next seat and he ordered me to move it and gave me an awful look. Again, when my coworker asked for a bag, he almost throws it to him. I'm not going back. You should really talk him about customer service."}
{"text":"One of the best bets for lunch at Yonge/St Clair.  Consistent quality and variety makes this one of my go-to places for lunch during the work week.    There's seating but I always grab and go.  The sandwiches and salads are great, but I almost always get the pasta - I'll get a container of two types of pasta and it's enough  to last me for two lunches.  

It gets very busy at lunch, but don't be put off by the doubled line when you show up.  The staff are friendly and efficient and it moves along very quickly."}
{"text":"I have been going here since 2007 and I have always enjoyed the place. It has good food at good prices. I was having lunch on their beautiful outdoor patio overlooking the cemetery when two women and a man started smoking. Since smoking is not permitted on the patio and because I was eating, I asked them if they'd mind not smoking. They all became belligerent and the man threatened violence and called me a homophobic slur. I complained to the man at the till about the physical threat because I asked them to stop smoking (as it is against the law on patios) and instead of being supportive, he also started shouting at me. I left behind my lunch."}
