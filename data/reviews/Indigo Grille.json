{"text":"Went there for Easter brunch 2016 with my family (we had reservations).   When we arrived, there wasn't much food left.  We waited for the salmon, but they never filled it up.  It was such a bad place to eat with such a good view.  I couldn't believe the price for such a bad meal.  Save your money!  The view and the bar are nice."}
{"text":"Tried the Pizza in the bar. It was good with plenty of toppings. Actually big enough for two people to share. Would recommend it next time your at Indigo."}
{"text":"As it's the only restaurant within 15 miles of the Festival Ranch subdivision and Copper Canyon golf club, we are frequent diners. Don't expect table service- you order and pay then get your own beverages but the views from the tables by the windows or on the patio more than make up for it. The menu is basic but the fare is tasty and better than most independent American restaurants in Surprise. Service, though limited, has always been courteous and helpful."}
{"text":"The food is way too expensive and not good at all. The chicken pot pie is terrible, the French dip sandwich has cheese, onions and soggy. The fish and chips are terrible if you want good fish reasonable go to Fuzzys off of Reems. Club sandwich only has one kind of meat instead of three.
They allow clubs to meet and take up too much room instead of having their meetings in another room if not catered. They should have tile instead of dirty carpeting on the floor. Try to avoid the restaurant as much as possible."}
{"text":"Food was very good and priced great. I had the half Cobb salad and it didn't disappoint. Others in my party got the burger and kettle chips.  Nice place and friendly servers."}
{"text":"The staff is great (but not trained). Food coming out of the kitchen is off and on; sometimes good and sometimes bad. Have gone with party of six and food was delivered in three groups about ten minutes apart. I would give it one star, but I think the staff is really trying, and are nice people. We have been a few times and never see the manager. I don't know how they will do when more homes are sold in this development. I would not encourage a prospective home buyer to buy in this community based on the Indigo Grill being a selling point."}
{"text":"Really a let down for such a great location.  The menu never changes and the food never improves...after a dozen tries, we give up and will dine at other clubs in the area. If they hope to make it in the long run, a big face lift to the d√©cor is needed as well.  With plans of thousands more home coming to this club, they better get with the times!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Never enough staff to serve guests. Employees are always running. Waited 25 minutes and never had a server even stop by so we left. The food is good and prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"As a resident of Festival it is very disheartening for us to have such a wonderful community with such a horrible restaurant. When we moved here 3 years ago it was a different story. There is no reason why we couldn't have a nice full service restaurant. You wait to be seated by a hostess and then it takes a long time from there on with the service. Ordering over the phone is not any better. I called in an order tonight spoke with Kim and she fumbled and stumbled taking an easy two dinner meal. Asked her how many wings come with the order nope she didn't know. All staff should know the menu and should be able to answer questions regarding the foods on the menu. Not sure how they stay open. Not very well managed by Troon."}
{"text":"I am surprised that this place is still open!  After 5 meals at this place that masquerades as a restaurant I've had enough and stopped wasting my money buying something that looks like food but reality must just be grease covered cardboard replicas.  

Service seems to be a foreign concept at the Indigo grill.  If you want something like a water refill or a condiment - you will have to get that yourself or is you wait for the wait staff to come back to you table you will be there for a long long long time waiting and waiting.  

Good luck getting what you order - went there with friends and 2 of us got some sort breakfast that we didn't order (which means someone else got our order).  So - while the rest of or group ate, we had to sit there and wait and wait and wait for our order to show up - of course, by then everyone else was done eating - wonderful!  I think the waiter was upset that we just didn't accept what he brought to the table.

And good luck getting the \"special\".  Every day they have a special - what they mean is if you are lucky enough to get that dish you would be one of the special ones.  I've never had a special; why, because they ALWAYS run out of what ever is on special.  Today is seafood - a jambalaya dish listed at $14.95!!!!  Really?  $15 bucks!  I could have a nice sirloin at the Outback for about the same price."}
{"text":"Just had lunch..Service was fantastic and the food was really good. Very fair pricing and very clean"}
{"text":"First time, pretty friendly bartender . Prices for food very nice especially Golf Course club!!!!! Will be back"}
{"text":"Had a late lunch/early dinner there with 2 friends on New Year's Day--overall, disappointing for the following reasons:

** Although it looks like a \"restaurant\" it's really a \"cafeteria\"--you pick up a menu as you enter and form a line, then give the cashier your selection, pay your bill, and go find a table on your own.  Your food will be brought to you.  

** For a group of people standing in line, it's difficult to decide if the group wants to order an appetizer, split a bottle of wine, etc.  It's also very hard to tell if you may or may not want to order dessert the minute you have walked in, before you've had your meal.  No one followed up later with us on any of these things, though the place seemed well staffed.  

** There was a once-grand Christmas tree in the dining room, but 3/4 of the ornaments had been removed and it was no longer lighted.  New Year's Day may or may not be too late to expect to see an artificial tree lighted, but if it's time to remove it, then REMOVE IT all at once!  No one was working on it, and a half-done project like this reflects badly on the ambience of the entire operation.

This place has an attractive dining room, a spectacular view of the mountains and the golf course, and is located at Sun City Festival in Buckeye--the only restaurant for miles around--and the food is good and reasonably priced.  However, the way it is being run is a big disappointment."}
{"text":"Have been here many times visiting family. The food has gone down hill. They mess things up and get mad when you send it back. I ordered a steak and half of it was beyond well done. I sent it back and the cook threw that part up and cut the rest up that was medium. He had the waitress bring it back and say I was wrong."}
{"text":"This was our 1st visit since they remodeled.  Came with a group of friends for happy hour.  Was really disappointed with the limited selection, which was further limited by being out of one of the items (that sounded the most appetizing).  My beef sliders were plain & dry & the chili cheese fries seemed like yesterday's leftovers.  We enjoyed the company, the service was great & the remodel looks wonderful.  Hopefully this is a short term situation that will improve with time."}
{"text":"Met 2 friends for breakfast at the Indigo Grill. This was possibly the worst breakfast we have ever had. The only reason why they even earned one star was because the person who brought our food did a good job. I ordered an egg white omelette with cheddar and tomatoes as my side. They forgot the cheese. When they brought it back the omelette had cold cheese thrown on it. When I asked them if they can redo it since the cheese should come melted the omelette the omelette came back microwaved. Btw the microwaved my entire plate including the lettuce and tomato. My friend ordered basted eggs which obviously the grill doesn't know how to make since even after it came back the eggs were way overcooked. The yolks were harder then if they were hard boiled. What a disappointment. The only reason why people go there is because there is no other place around. Festival is planning on enlarging the restaurant as our development grows but if they don't improve their food it will continue to be a losing business."}
{"text":"Thank you Indigo Grille for your service, and sweet disposition. We had 2 lovely servers. One who's name escapes me, the other, Brittany. Super helpful, and informative as far as the menu. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"This could be a great place to eat. Here in Sun City Festival we are a captured audience. We are 15 plus miles west of Surprise. We don't have any restaurants or stores here. We only have Indigo Grille. The food in never consistent, the service is poor , the menu is expensive for what you get and not much to pick from. The buffet, when they gave it, is expensive and lukewarm at most. We at Festival would love to have a restaurant we could go and enjoy and get quality every time. Management needs to clean house and step up. We , as Home owners, have to subsidize the Grille through our HOA fees because the Grille loses revenue every quarter. Why are we punished???"}
{"text":"Indigo Grill is in a great golf course resort location. The food is good and everything we've had has been well prepared. Happy hour sliders are one of my favorites along with an oversized Cobb Salad that easily feeds a couple. Beer battered fish and chips also hit the spot. Breakfast is also a great deal and prices are really reasonable. It's a great place to bring quests from out of town. Sit, have a great meal and enjoy a wonderful location. We do avoid Friday night; it's loud and lots of table hopping the locals love it happy hour."}
{"text":"We live in Sun City Festival and go up to the Grille often. We attend Happy Hour where they have live music and people dance and have a lot of fun. The music is free and the drinks are generously poured and very reasonably priced. The wait staff are extremely friendly and get to know everyone on a first name basis.
We eat breakfast there after our Saturday tennis match and there are many choices and a relaxing outdoor patio to enjoy.
My only complaint is they are not very responsive to suggestions. After years of complaints about the cafeteria style of standing inline to order and then getting a number and having food delivered to your table they are finally changing. Wait staff will now be coming to your table with a pad and taking your order like  a real restaurant . 
They are remodeling too which we are waiting to see. 
I would say the food is average, not bad but not great! They have a rather large captive audience and a good chef would bring this place up to five stars for sure."}
{"text":"This place has gone way down hill.  Changed their format to a hostess seating method.  If you are intent on making that change, then make sure someone promptly waits on you after you are seated.  Especially after you made a reservation, because they can no longer support walk-in demand.  The menu has been scaled down and the prices have been substantially increased.  They are out of control and need a bonafide food manager to save them, otherwise they will not survive.  One question...why did ownership change a successful business model that had worked for years?  Baffling, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"We live in Sun City Festival part of the year so dine here frequently.  Service is outstanding and we have never been disappointed in a meal.  I especially like the Southwest Crispy Chicken Salad.  Plenty of outside seating with a beautiful mountain view.  It's worth the drive if you're not a Festival resident!"}
{"text":"We live in Festival and eat here often.
First, the staff has always been super friendly. It does not take them long to remember your name and whet you like.
The food has been very good for us. We've ordered almost everything on the menu and have not been disappointed.
They are expanding the inside bar/restaurant area, and adding an outside bar and additional outside seating. This should help with some overcrowding that they are starting to see. Can't wait for the opening."}
{"text":"this place is a charm! come for the friendly folks, stay for the delightful staff, enjoy the music entertainment on select days. scrumptious food, mouthwatering appetizers and undeliverable pricing. is this really happening! You will be back and you will bring your friends along with you as well!"}
{"text":"The first time we visited Festival was about 2 years ago.  After a year of exploring other properties we decided to buy in Festival and have now been residents for a year.  When we were given the realtor tour, we could see that the property, the landscaping, ponds, public areas were pristine and well maintained.   During the last year, the areas visible to the prospective buyer have been maintained.  What you don't see is that deeper into the community, the landscaping needs attention, the ponds are drying up, and green space is now brown space.   We were promised a quality dining venue called Indigo Grill.  In the last 6 months, the quality of the food served has deteriorated a great deal while the prices were raised significantly.  In the most recent report from Maricopa County, The Indigo Grill was given a \"B\" rating by health inspectors.  During the summer months the bar in the outside patio closes.  It should be noted that the patio has heaters but lacks a mister system.  Does this make sense?
Keep in mind that Del Webb is only a name that Pulte purchased and that Del Webb's mission was to build and market a lifestyle.  It is unfortunate that Pulte wants only to sell homes, refuses to expand on the amenities and is not sensitive to homeowner's needs or wants.    

In conclusion, \"BUYER BEWARE\".  What you are told and what is delivered most likely don't match."}
{"text":"Dump this Dump! Troon needs to fire the very top of this joke of a place to eat. Food is awful, they keep going thru cooks and staff walks out, when will they get rid of the Root Cause of this failure?"}
{"text":"We live at Sun City Festival which is about 15 miles west of Surprise. The indigo Grill located at Sun City Festival is the only restaurant for 15 miles. The staff at the indigo Grill is very friendly; I believe most of them are neighbors! 
The food, however, is a mixed bag. This time, we ordered items that were not grilled. 
My wife ordered a taco salad; It was OK!
I ordered a tuna salad with cottage cheese; it was OK, too! 
My daughter ordered chicken salad with cottage cheese; it was OK as well!
We had had some disappointments in the past, and we are learning that some menu items are better than others. 
It's too bad, because this problem with food quality and taste is very fixable. 
The restaurant is casual with great views of the mountains and the golf course. It's a lovely and relaxed setting.
This is written not as a hit-and-run food critic, but as a resident who would like to support the local restaurant. If the food quality and taste to improve, the place would be packed. People would flock to it from miles around!
