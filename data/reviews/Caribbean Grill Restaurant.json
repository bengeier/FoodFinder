{"text":"Really authentic Jamaican food. Large portions and good value for the money. I am really glad that the owner converted the food truck to the restaurant. Now we can enjoy Caribbean food any time we want in the CU area."}
{"text":"I came in on Friday afternoon and got the Beef Oxtails special to go. The service was efficient and my food was done quickly. The food was delicious and they included wrapped silverware with my to go order which was a nice touch. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What else is there to say? This food is consistently delicious. I always order sauce on the side as it is eyewateringly spicy. The yams are so flavorful and my kids love them!"}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to visit the permanent location, having been a regular visitor to the food truck on campus. Same great food (jerk chicken, rice and beans, plantains mac and cheese), now with rotating daily specials. Jerk ribs were delicious, can't wait to try the oxtail. Excellent service as always. Bonus points for using more environmentally friendly packaging for takeout."}
{"text":"I always get the jerk chicken with plantains- the jerk sauce they serve on the side is soooo flavorful and spicy, absolutely delicious. I need to try some of the other sides, but this dish is phenomenal. I'm so lucky to have Caribbean Grill so close to my office. And of course thank you to the staff for the friendly smiles and quick service! It's always a pleasure to come in here!!"}
{"text":"Wow this was a pleasant surprise!!  Very nice restaurant and friendly staff!  I had the jerk ribs and I must say, it brought back memories of my Caribbean trip years ago, the plantains were cooked perfectly and the green beans were so flavorful!  I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Divine.  The employees were friendly and helpful upon hearing that it was our first visit, explaining the menu to us.  I had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and two sides (Mac and cheese and green beans), and my husband had the meatballs with Mac and cheese and cole slaw.  Everything was excellent, full of flavor but still suitable for a less adventurous eater.  I liked that the chicken was served with the jerk sauce on the side, so you can control the flavor/heat.  Just by itself, the chicken fell off the bone - so good.  But for us, the real star was the rum pineapple cake.  It is simply to die for.  I bought two more pieces to take home to my parents!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! I just had Caribbean Grill for lunch. I had the Jerk Chicken salad and a side of mac and cheese. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Maybe the best casual food I've ever eaten. The side of jerk sauce provides an awesome explosion of spice.  Not for the faint of heart."}
{"text":"This was first time we tried Jamaican food.  We had the Jerk Chicken and Curry Chicken.  The jerk chicken had the perfect amount of spice.  The curry chicken was super tender and fell off the bone.  Rice was moist and very flavorful. I will definitely stop here every time Im in Champaign."}
{"text":"Coming from Florida, some island food is to be desired in the Midwest. Luckily, this shop finally opened up and I get my oxtail fix every Friday, which I highly recommend!

I personally am not a huge fan of jerk sauce, but I find the sauce here enjoyable but exceptionally spicy. Homeboy can eat spicy food, but I'm talking if you use the whole sauce container on a single portion of food, you'll feel like you got pepper sprayed in the face. Just proceed with caution and enjoy the meal"}
{"text":"Always the best. And check it out, they must have slowly gotten the 217 primed for a great jerk sauce with heat. I felt it was lacking (the heat, not the yum) when the food truck was first poppin off, but I just finished my meal and the heat is in effect! I love it!"}
{"text":"Found this gem of a hole-in-the-wall on maps app looking for more selection of eats. Looking at the reviews many have said that it was the best restaurant in the Champaign Urbana area. What I liked was that the food, even though it was Jamaican cuisine, was pretty close to food from home since my roots are Dominican/Puerto Rican. Had the Jerk Chicken meal which was dark meat Jerk Chicken with rice and beans and sweet plantains. Ordered it as take out. The food was delicious. Very wholesome. Definitely felt great eating some sweet plantains since the flavor hits so close to home. The extra jerk sauce gave the meal an extra kick with lots of flavor. Really enjoyed the food in this establishment. My only request is that thy should serve oxtail a little more often than once a week. It was something that I was craving but didn't have it the day I went."}
{"text":"One of my fave Chambana restaurants! Really great Jerk Chicken and awesome sides! Make sure to try the Mac & Cheese... It's so good!  The only negative is only a small inconvenience that they won't take pick up orders over the phone. I guess I can understand that people can place orders then never show up, but perhaps CG can come up with a better solution other than making you come in to place your order and wait."}
{"text":"My favorite new restaurant in Chambana. Had jerk chicken, rice n peas, and the meatballs. Their jerk sauce is fire and we were happy for the XL lemonades to cool off with. Forgot to get a patty, but will fix that next visit."}
{"text":"Good food at a fair price. Food has a nice spiciness, but not to spicy. Get the jerk chicken with mac n cheese and plantains."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, phenomenal both times. Once take out, the other dine in. Food is amazing, incredible flavor and spice. Mac and cheese is excellent, better than you'd expect. Lots of food for the price, and both times the service was friendly and food was ready in five minutes. I'll definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Counter-serve casual dining restaurant specializing in Jamaican jerk. Generous portions. You choose a meat and 1 or 2 sides, it also comes with rice with beans. Each night there is a special (Saturday was pork ribs) or every night you can choose from chicken, meatballs, or portobello mushrooms. All are spicy, but the chicken is not too hot, especially if you remove the skin. Meatballs were a little hotter and ribs were a little too spicy if you aren't a fan of spicy. If you like hot food, all are perfect. If you love extra spicy they give you jerk sauce on the side. Mac and cheese, green beans, fried plantains, were great, candied yams and mango tea were a bit too sweet. Pineapple rum cake was sweet but delicious. $54 for 4 people and a good lunch leftover. No alcohol. Service was pleasant, patient, quick, and articulate. Paper plates and recycled plastic utensils. Takes credit cards."}
{"text":"I was eager to try this place as I never had Caribbean food before.   The place is in a strip mall a little hard to find.   But it is a hidden gem.   Service was great, place was clean.   Has the jerk chicken and meatballs with he Mac and cheese.  It was great!   The food was flavorful and a decent portion.   I only gave 4 stars because the food ended up being more spicy than I was prepared for.  That's not a bad thing as my son enjoyed his food thoroughly."}
{"text":"TL;DR (out of 5):
Finishing their transition from food truck to brick and mortar shop, Caribbean Grill continues to provide much needed Caribbean flare.  While a little lacking in finesse and consistency in their claim to fame (jerk chicken), the service is streamlined and quick, and the workers are always bubbly and welcoming.  Definitely a go-to when you're trying to change things up!

The first time I came to Caribbean Grill, it was a Friday - the special for which is Beef Oxtails.  How could I not?  And I was glad I did. The oxtails were flavorful, succulent, and almost fell of the... tail? I ordered my meal with two sides: rice and beans and cabbage.  Even more surprising was that they were also quite delicious, both with a hint of jalapeno heat.  Amazing!  Unfortunately, the plantain that came with the meal left a bit to be desired (thankfully I hadn't ordered extra plantains as a side).

The second time I came here with friends and we all ordered the jerk chicken (this time I ordered mac and cheese instead of rice and beans).  As I bit into the jerk chicken, expecting it to be at least as good as the oxtails (it's what they're famous for, right?), I was completely underwhelmed by the lack of flavor and dryness of the chicken.  It didn't make sense to me that a restaurant that's supposed to specialize in caribbean jerk chicken could make something so... boring?  A little into the meal I found the jerk sauce in a small container, only to realize that it was more of a vinaigrette than a sauce and was terribly sour and off-putting.  Sure, there were some flavors other than the vinegar, but I could get over the overpowering astringency that came through.  VERY disappointing.

To be honest, I'm pretty split on this place.  I love that they're bringing Caribbean food to town.  But their staples, the simple foods (jerk chicken and fried plantains) are wistfully lacking in flavor and appeal.  On the other hand, their specials and sides are amazing - made with love and tradition, well-seasoned, and like nothing you'll find in Chambana.  My recommendation for you: stick with the specials if possible; there's a better chance you'll enjoy them.  My recommendations for CG: put the same amount of focus into your main staple as your specials, or add your specials to your regular menu!

Oxtails w/ 2 sides (Friday special): $15.49
Jerk Chicken w/ 2 sides: $10.49"}
{"text":"Caribbean Grill is a delicious, local fast-casual restaurant located just off Neil Street in a strip mall.  The jerk chicken is incredibly flavorful, as are the plantains and the mac and cheese.  I'm also a big fan of the burrito, which is among the best I've had.

Beyond that, the restaurant is bright and clean and my service has always been top notch.  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I love the vege side. It is little pricy consider the portion of the food. But overall. It is really good."}
{"text":"Cool interior. Fast and friendly service. I had the meatballs, mac n cheese, and plantains; each were great. Huge fan of plantains and these were on par with the best I've had. 10/10 recommended."}
{"text":"If you expect to come here at lunch DO NOT COME!!!! The food is good for it being in the area it's in, but not worth the wait. They state that they can't take orders over the phone which I've NEVER heard before at a restaurant. When I tried calling in before hand I explained to the receptionist that it takes ten mins for me to get there and they my lunch was only 30 mins, she then ASSURED me that they would have me in and out because the food was already cooked! I get here and there are people waiting on there food. I then asked her how long it would take she said not long, then her superior told me \"it's first come first serve\" with a nonchalant attitude. I wish I was told the truth over the phone before I wasted my time driving there on my break for lunch. Never again. This was my first time trying this place and I doubt I ever come back. Time is money, and they lying to customers over the phone to get money is unacceptable! My employees told me to let them know about it after I tried because they never had it before either, I'll be SURE to tell them not to waste their time."}
{"text":"OMG...where do I start. I had the pleasure of attending the soft opening of the new restaurant and the experience was fantastic. First off, the staff were so friendly and welcoming and the service is fast which is perfect for lunch. I ordered the Jerk Chicken and cabbage. The chicken is so tender and it literally falls off the bone and the cabbage is my favorite side. You have to try the fruit punch too! I can't wait for the grand opening."}
{"text":"Came in for late lunch, 4:30 so no one else there. Ordered meatballs w/ mac and cheese as my side, for take out. All was very good, came with small fried plantain.  Was plenty enough to fill me up. I like spicy and this was at my spice limit but I used all my sauce which was on the side. Will definitely be back to try some of the daily specials. Also napkins are very nice, disposable but feel more like cloth and solid fork and knife, not like some garbage utensils from most places. Oh, and the service (very important) was very pleasant. Try this place out."}
{"text":"Went to their much anticipated grand opening at their new location and was pleasantly surprised how nice everything was. I was curious how they would incorporate their food truck roots to the restaurant, and it was seamless. It's truly a perfect space for this wonderful business. 

I opted for the jerk chicken burrito and the rice 'n peas while my girlfriend got the burrito with the mac 'n cheese. Everything was so good, but the mac 'n cheese really stood out. It was tremendous. The burrito was spicy, filling, and really hit the spot.

I'm so happy with the new location and can't wait to go back. The wait was worth it, well done Caribbean Grill! I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"I had the oxtail and it was really good. The plantains and the cabbage was also really good. The only thing I didn't like was the mango tea, it was way to sweet for me."}
{"text":"Man what can I say! Caribbean Grill is becoming (or has become) a Champaign/Urbana staple! The ox tails are phenomenal! The Mac n cheese? Lord! My husband lives for the Mac n cheese. Restaurant is clean, food is fresh and cooked well! Owners are very nice and accommodating!  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!  Our honeymoon was in Jamaica and we fell in love with the food. We've had the jerk chicken, jerk meatballs, Jamaican curry, Mac n cheese, yams, and beef patty.  And of course the plantains and rice and beans.  Everything was amazing but I think the curry and the yams were my favorite. My husband loves the jerk chicken and mac and cheese. It's also perfect that it's less spicy now as well so I can share with my toddler.  I can't wait to try more stuff the next time!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, fast, and unique in town. I love the meatballs, but the candied yams were amazing. It was a spicy meal, but not over the top. Definitely worth a stop. It may not be the cheapest lunch, but plenty of food to fill me up!"}
{"text":"Great authentic jerk chicken. The Mac and cheese and rice and beans are also very good. One of my new favorite places."}
{"text":"The food is so good and the location is so cute! They have indoor AND outdoor seating which is perfect for a nice day. The food comes quickly and the service is great as well. You can dine in or carryout! This was seriously the perfect location for a quick and casual lunch. My menu favorite is the jerk chicken, but I also highly recommend the jerk meatballs. I LOVE the mac and cheese and the cabbage too! The rice and peas are also delicious. I am excited to try the fish and the ox tails in the future as well. If you are looking for a fun, delicious and affordable place to eat I definitely recommend Caribbean Grill!"}
{"text":"Stop.. Don't look for another place to eat, this is it! On a road trip we stopped for lunch. Omg everything was so delicious and so flavorful. We stopped in on a Friday and the special was ox tail.  A must get. A long with the Mac and cheese. U will not be disappointed. This was my first time trying Ox tail and I only hope I can find a place close to home that can live up to what we just had. The kids had chicken and green beans. Both very good. And the hot sauce.. Man they were joking. ITS HOT, but very good as well if u love hot. The girl taking our order was very friendly and made sure our order was correct. If ever we are close again we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is great! It's located in that plaza behind Biaggis. Great jerk chicken. The candies yams are so good! Mango tea and fruit punch, so so good! The menu I small but the taste really makes up for a small menu. Homemade pineapple rum cake is a must try! I will be sure to come back and recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"Delicious jerk-flavor food!! Chicken is tender and full of flavor, and the sides are delicious too :-)
Everything tastes homemade here, and the sweet mango tea is refreshing and yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! I tried their Flavor Box which is 5.99. The box comes with either Jerk Chicken or Meatballs & a side of rice n' peas and one additional side. I had the Mac and cheese and it was flavorful and cheesy. The service is fast, staff is friendly and the place is clean. Their Caribbean rum cake is delicious too. It's not too sweet and you can taste the rum."}
{"text":"I frequented on a day when their chicken curry was the lunch special.  Naturally, I followed my frugal pattern of ordering and made my request for the chicken curry.  It came with rice and I added mac n cheese.  I had very high expectations, and my meal did not meet them.  I didn't love the flavor of the curry nor was it as spicy as I like.  Maybe, I should have asked for enhanced heat.  The chicken was nothing to write home about and the rice was rice.   The one saving component was the mac n cheese.  It was a delightful treat.  Overall, it was a pretty good meal but I don't think I'll order the same dish again.  However, I will keep it consistent with mac n cheese as my side.

I would categorize this as a carry out establishment fo sho."}
{"text":"I stand by what I said in my previous review, but I just can't justify giving any less than 5 stars when I come back every week. The jerk chicken burrito on Tuesdays with mac & cheese and plantains is the order to make here.
I also tried the meatballs. The plate comes with 12 along with their rice & peas. Very good and satisfying dishes. 
The service is also great here, and they've recently started a loyalty program -- $5 off after 5 visits."}
{"text":"As a Jamaican living in Florida and visiting Urbana Caribbean Grill is a great find. 
Great authentic food served in a clean inviting restaurant. I tried the Brown stewed  Chicken and it was delicious. I really have no complaints. Lots of flavor but not overpowering by trying too hard to be Caribbean. The chicken was perfectly cooked and paired with a side of Mac and cheese makes a filling and enjoyable meal. 
The service is also noteworthy as often times it is missed by many Caribbean restaurants. Not here though as the young man behind the counter was pleasant and informative. 
Caribbean Grill is definitely worth a try if you're in the area and looking for some good food."}
{"text":"Wowzer! Loved everything about our meal! The oxtail is THE BEST. Only a Friday Special! Cute store front and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Surprising my EXCELLENT FOOD!!!!  Wow, Champaign has really surprised me...  Had the curry chicken with EXTREMELY DELICIOUS SIDES: Green Beans, Cabbage, Mac & Cheese, corn bread, and of course the peas/rice.  Maybe the best green beans and cabbage I've had, extraordinarily flavorful!!!!!  The cornbread is CORNBREAD, not cake passing...  Also had the swirl punch and lemonade which was good but sweet!  I'll definitely return!!!!"}
{"text":"So after a movie in Savoy watching baby driver which turned out to be an awesome amazing movie of its own with an excellent soundtrack we decided to come to Caribbean grill we decided that because it had 19 five star reviews of 19 reviews.

We ordered candied yams cabbage macaroni and cheese jerky meat balls jerk chicken a meat pie and rum cake. We really lucked out because we got the last meat pie and they take a little bit to prepare.

The Jamaican jerk chicken was fall off the bone delicious it was cooked to perfection in the meat had so much flavor we hardly didn't even use the jerk seasoning but we did and then added a bit of spice and a very complex flavor that was uniquely delicious.

We were still hungry though so I went back up and I ordered the jerk chicken dinner which consisted of this delicious dirty rice with beans some grilled onions a single fried planting, and it came with two sides again we chose the mac & cheese and also coleslaw

Let me tell you about the mac & cheese it was not your traditional overly cheesy mac & cheese with this was was elbow macaroni with some sort of spices and just perfectly enough cheese but it was cooked to perfection it was orderly delicious and we devoured it twice. The coleslaw was extremely creamy and crispy and delicious a perfect accompaniment to cut the spice of the chicken

The meatballs were exceptional although small they packed a huge amount of flavor and one dipped in the jerk sauce that came with it were extraordinary.
 The yams oh my God the candid yams I am so happy we ordered the medium side of that because they were all really delicious they were in this Candide sauce that reminded me of brown sugar and some other spices that perfectly melted together the perfectly cooked yeah is that literally melted in your mouth, outstanding I could eat those every day with every meal they were that good.

The ending of the meal came while I was still finishing my meal my wife had ordered the rum cake slice it was a perfectly cut piece someone Bundt cake slice shaped with some nuts and a slight glaze of rum. My wife makes this for me at home for special occasions and she has perfected the recipe over the years so she joked with the clerk who said that he did indeed big these cakes for them using an old Jamaican recipe. My wife devoured the slice in fact she walked up and bought two more to go I had a piece of one it was dance but buttery rum deliciousness.

All in all it was an excellent delicious meal and I highly recommend anyone in the area to come in and try it it is exceptionally delicious the people there were knowledgeable about what they sold and where it came from they were very gracious hosts and for a fast food establishment it was an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Delicious! Everything I've tried here is pretty darn good. My first experience was with Caribbean Grill's Goat Curry ($15) served over rice & peas, with a side of fried plantains. It was amazing - tender meat melded with the rice in all the right ways with the sweet kick of plantains on the side. My dining companion had the Jerk Chicken Flavor Box ($6), which he complimented as well. The Mango Sweet Tea ($2.29) lives up to the Southern standard of sweet tea. It's very sweet. A bit too sweet for this Northerner's tastebuds. I couldn't walk away without the tempting Rum Cake ($4.29), which was moist and delicious with toasted nuts on top. After having such a flavor-packed experience, I went back for more - the Oxtails ($16). The slow-cooked meat just fell off the bone & paired wonderfully with the rice & peas. The Mac & Cheese side is classic comfort food with a little spicy afterglow. The lemonade ($2.29) tasted of real lemons, which is the way all lemonade should taste, without too much sugar to mask it.

The staff was so friendly. The food appeared fast. The restaurant's interior was clean. Utensils, napkins, and iced water were at the ready. Sometimes, there is a queue - probably because the food is so good. I have yet to try the Jerk Chicken. But given that everything I've tried so far has been a win, I don't think it will be long before I return."}
{"text":"Other Yelpers' reviews encouraged me to try the Caribbean Grill tonight. I'd heard good things about the food truck, but hadn't tried that either. I went tonight because it's Friday, and the Friday special is oxtails. 

Traditionally, Jamaican oxtails are stewed (that is, slow cooked Grandma style) bone-in until the meat is fork tender and sticky. Fat is not much trimmed; this is not diet food. Oxtails are cooked with broad beans in a braise flavored with allspice, garlic, thyme, scotch bonnet pepper, and onions. That is exactly what I was served up -- and it was good. 

The stew was served on top of rice n peas (traditionally, this dish is made with long grain rice, kidney beans, garlic, onions, scotch bonnet pepper, bay leaves, thyme, paprika, chicken broth, and coconut milk). Personally, I'd choose to have this side dish served separately, since its texture and flavor were drowned by the oxtails.

A side of fried plantains was also included in the price of the  special. These were two bias-cut slices of island heaven -- creamy on the inside and slightly sweet with a delicate, nutty fry on the outside. 

For my optional side, I chose the cabbage. The cabbage is simple: cooked down in broth with tender sliced carrots -- just like Grandma's. It made a nice complement to the spicier flavor of the oxtails and helped to balance their richness.

I got my order to go. It was served in a pressed paper clamshell with plastic flatware served in a napkin. I asked for a Diet Coke, and this came in a can. I wouldn't have minded eating in, though. The restaurant is small, but well air conditioned, clean, and modern, with corrugated steel wainscotting (to remind us of the food shacks on the islands) and some tasteful, enlarged images of island foods and ingredients (such as peppercorns). Island music was playing in the background.

My order was $13.99 (for the Friday special with a side) plus drink. That seemed a reasonable price for the quality of food I received and the amount. Portions are neither enormous nor tiny -- but somewhere in the middle (just right). 

My partner had tried the Caribbean Grill a few weeks before for lunch during the workday and forgot to mention it to me (how could he!?). He did not have as positive an experience as I did. The person at the counter who took his order seemed unwelcoming (he wondered whether she was having a bad day). Contrast to the guy who took my order; he was friendly and glad to talk about the restaurant. On my partner's visit, the fish was too intensely seasoned -- the flavors overwhelmed the fish. However, I did not find that to be the case with the oxtails. My partner gave them a try tonight and agreed with me that they were perfectly seasoned."}
{"text":"Flavors are wonderful, quantity is generous, and preparation is fast! Got the chicken jerk and it was so soft and juicy, comes with a side or two (with different prices), but I recommend getting the mac and cheese on the side and the meatballs a la carte (which they actually give to you in similar quantities to the entry side). 
Plaintains were just average, but this spot is definitely a place to get lunch to go!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place has me coming back every Friday for their beef oxtail special. Pretty pricey but very worth it. Some of the most tender meat I have ever had, and it mixes perfectly with the rice. I usually get it with fried plantains and mac & cheese (no joke, some of the best in the area if you like it with a mild kick). The jerk chicken is also exceptionally tender and falls right off the bone. Wasn't as big a fan of the meatballs personally but still wasn't bad. 

I'd say it's really more of a take out place than dine in, since it doesn't have many tables and they are all right by the door."}
{"text":"Finally something different in Champaign! This was my initial thought when I found this place, however, this Caribbean spot is \"Just ok\" I was visiting family in Champaign and decided to give this place a try. Being from Chicago, there are authentic Jerk chicken restaurants everywhere! Based on the reviews on yelp, I had high expectations but I was let down. In my opinion it taste nothing like real jerk chicken but more of a \"smoked chicken\" that was lacking real authentic jerk flavor. The meat was dry and boring. The only saving grace is if you drown the meat with the jerk sauce they provide, this will add a little flavor. Jerk chicken should be seasoned so well that the sauce should only enhance the flavor should you decide to use it. There is no competition for this place in Champaign so it's a little overpriced and the locals don't have anything to compare the food too. I don't think this place would do well in Chicago. I did however like the design of the restaurant and the cashier was very nice."}
{"text":"Well this Midwesterner wouldn't know \"authentic\" Caribbean food but he does know the food here is delicious. Also the place is small but tidy, so not a \"hole in the wall.\" Also I'm just crazy about the cute girl who usually works the register. Can I say that?"}
{"text":"Jerk meatballs, rice & peas, fried plantains are soo good. The curry chicken is also fantastic. I keep wanting to try the other specials but it's so hard to pass up those meatballs!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!! 

I got the Jerk meatballs, and it was a healthy portion. One friend got the Oxtail special, which was so tender and cooked to perfection. She also got the Island Punch, which tasted like Hawaiian Punch but a million times better. Another friend got the Jerk chicken, which was quite spicy and delicious. We all got mac and cheese as our side, which is a must!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, amazingly friendly staff. Tastes great and 90% of the menu is gluten free!!! The candied yams are to die for. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"The chicken meal is great. Others are ok only.
Highly recommend the girk chicken with steam cabbage as side."}
{"text":"Best restaurant fare I've had in ages. We went on a Friday and got the oxtail and three orders of jerk chicken. We tried most of the sides and they were all fantastic. 

The plantains and mac and cheese stood out the most. The oxtail was fall off the joint great and the chicken fantastic. The flavors are heavenly. 

The mango tea drink was delish.  

I'd drive all the way from Effingham just to eat. However a location in Effingham would be awesome. 

For kids who don't like spice get the green beans as a side. The mac and cheese may be too spicy."}
{"text":"They got the best food in Champaign Illinois...i love there food best place to enjoy your food good service good hospitality good business good people"}
{"text":"Oh man, this is some delicious food!  I had the jerk chicken with mac n cheese and yams.  The chicken is outstanding, so spicy and flavorful and tender.  My mouth is watering just typing this review.  The mac n cheese is also very good.  The yams were over-sweet for my taste but that's ok, I'll just try another side next time.  There's also a plantain in the meal deal, which is cartelized into a little sweet bit of heaven.  I've also had the jerk meatballs and they are so good.  I'm thrilled there is a brick and mortar location for this spot so that I can have more regular access to this great food."}
{"text":"I finally gave this place a try after hearing all good things about it. I did a pick up order which I placed online. It was lunch and I don't need a lot for lunch so I ordered one of the $5 meals. I chose the jerk meatballs which came with rice and beans and I picked Mac and cheese as the other side (since it is almost always mentioned as great in reviews.) Everything was delicious and the service was prompt and friendly. If you like spicy, use all of the jerk sauce that is provided on the side. I love heat and the sauce delivers it in the best way. I will definitely eat here again and look forward to trying all of the different things."}
{"text":"Come eat here!! Had previously enjoyed visiting the Caribbean Grill food truck, and the restaurant is a nice, relaxing environment to enjoy this delicious food in! Had the jerk chicken which is always excellent, with candied yams, red beans and rice, and sweet, fried plantain! The service was also fast and friendly. Even though they were busy we didn't have to wait long for our food. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of attending the soft opening of the restaurant and the location is just as impressive as the food truck and other services CG provides. I would recommend the oxtails and a side of chicken with Mac and cheese.... See you guys for lunch today!!!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding and I say that as a vegetarian who can't enjoy their signature items :) Their mac and cheese is the best I've had in town. Creamy but with a touch of spice. Plantains are delicious. Yams are a tad too sweet for my taste but beautifully cooked. When they have rum cake, that is also delicious! Everyone I've gone with has enjoyed their food. Staff is very helpful and friendly and food is ready quickly. I also appreciate that they use degradable paper containers instead of styrofoam. Unfortunately they took the yummy portabella dish off the menu but honestly a meal of just sides is super yummy and cheaper for us vegetarians. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Delicious! 

I have always enjoyed catering from this place and was excited to their new location. The staff were so sweet and inviting. I got the jerk chicken with a regular side of Mac n cheese. It comes with peas and rice and a plantain. I got to try my friend's jerk meatballs. It was so yummy and a little spicy (if you can't handle spicy, be careful!). 

The jerk chicken comes with a few leg pieces and thigh pieces. This was very well seasoned and delicious! I love sweet plantain so I was happy this came along with the dish. The peas and rice are always my fave and it cooked with many spices. Lastly the Mac n cheese is done soooo right! I was happy I had a lot of it since I ordered a bigger portion. It had some peppers and the consistency and flavorful were on point. Definitely would recommend checking this place out! 

It's in a cute location too.. Near a strip mall!"}
{"text":"They have the best rum cake in town! We tried the jerk fish and jerk mushroom the taste was amazing. They have really good food but I didn't like the amount of spice they used maybe it was cumin or coriander, the taste hits the end of your throat!"}
{"text":"The food here is as good, if not better than what I had the three times I was in Jamaica. I like my jerk spicy, and CG did not disappoint. We went on a Monday, so I had the jerk fish. Delicious, tender, spicy and smoky. Their mac & cheese is some of the best in town, no box mixes here. The only thing missing is a cold Red Stripe, but that is easily solved by getting your meal to go. The staff is extremely polite and friendly, and the little restaurant was spotlessly clean."}

Restaurant review
2 words: Jerk Chicken. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Champaign. The spices are simply off the chart. The spiciness is not for the faint of heart, but once you take your first bite, you won't go back to normal chicken ever again. I don't know if it is fair to characterize it as a Champaign best in the caribbean food category as there is only one of it's kind down here, but you simply can't go wrong with this food. It is tucked away in a strip mall behind Biaggi, so you can easily miss it. My go to food would have to be the jerk chicken with one side. They given you ample amount of chicken with a side of Jerk sauce. There is a healthy helping of beans and rice under the chicken along with one side. I would strongly advise you try the mac and cheese which has a very mild kick. Normally you get a slice of plantain, however they forgot on my last order. Be careful with the spicy as the last time I had to guzzle a cup of milk to get the burn off my tongue. 

Pros: best jerk chicken, great spiciness/flavors

Cons: long wait times sometimes when they run out of a chicken, at one visit we had to wait 30 minutes for our order

{"text":"Well done Caribbean Grill!  I was truly impressed by the food and kind service.  This place is quaint, clean, laid  back, and casual.  But most importantly, they know food! The island food is a nice addition to the existing variety in the C-U area, fitting a category that I don't believe has been done before.  

I got the jerk meatballs and mac and cheese; however, I got to try the jerk chicken, and curry chicken.  All three plates were great!  The meatballs and jerk chicken have to be my favorite though.  The meatballs were a recommendation from the kind lady at the counter.  She warned me that they were spicy.  I agree, the had a spicy kick; however, I think it was done in a way where the food was still very flavorful and the spice was not overpowering, or uncomfortable.  In my opinion, it was just right.  

My group was also pleasantly surprised by the mac and cheese.  It was amazing, very flavorful and cheesy.  Not your everyday mac and cheese that gets its flavor mostly from salt.  This had spices, it had tons of stuff going on.  I had to order another side of it to-go.  The portion of food was also a decent size.  I was able to get two meals out of it (after I ordered my second side of mac and cheese).  I will be coming back to try your ox tails!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best eateries in the area. The food is A1. You really cannot go wrong with anything on the menu, but my favorite is the jerk chicken with mac and yams. The staff is responsive and conscientious. And the atmosphere is warm and inviting. I usually prepare my own meals, but when I do eat out, CG is one of the few regular spots that I go to get my fix. I would recommend them to anyone without hesitation."}
{"text":"Had some food to go here and it was DEE-LISH-US!!!
I grew up in the islands and lived in Jamaica so I am a tough critic. But the food has the requisite flavor and is seasoned to perfection! I would recommend the jerk chicken (large portions), jerk meatballs, mac n cheese, rice and peas...everything I've tried here has been wonderfully made. Try the rum cake for dessert! 
Couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who claimed the food wasn't flavorful. Took my mother there last week. There is no tougher (or vocal) critic of someone's cooking than a West Indian woman over 65 yo. 
My mom loved the food. Her only recommendation, have the jerk sauce on the side and use it as a dipping sauce. Also, mix the special fruit drink with water, a tad sweet for her. She has since had, jerk chicken, stew chicken, curry goat and oxtails from Caribbean Grill. Loved them all. So, I would take my mom's evaluation of Caribbean food over any other rating on Yelp - she has been cooking it for over half a century. Go in y'all! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Ordered the jerk chicken combo with 2 sides- fried plantains and Mac n cheese. The chicken was very juicy and flavorful. It also came with an additional sauce that had an interesting kick to it. The jerk rub was definitely different from what I experienced in Jamaica- there was a certain spice I couldn't pinpoint, but still good though. The Mac n cheese was also cooked well, with stringy cheese and good flavor in every bite (I personally recommend this side). The fried plantains were okay, a bit overfried in my opinion. I was definitely skeptical at first when I walked in since everything seemed precooked and set in big tubs- worth to try out regardless!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a change of fare and consulted Yelp. Glad I did. Tried this place on a Monday at about 12:05 PM and just missed the crowd. Had the meatballs and candied yam and it hit the spot. The only small disappointment was the one plantain that comes with the meal; I thought it was pretty lame having had much tastier plantain in Puerto Rico. The rest of the meal including the rice and beans which comes with the meatball meal was either excellent or good. (OK, maybe I've had better rice and beans, too, but as a side they were not bad.) The meatballs themselves were plentiful and excellent. Very tasty especially when you use the dip. Can't wait to try the the jerk chicken.

This place is probably going to be a bit too spicy for those who can't stand spicy, but I love spicy   food and will definitely be coming back to this somewhat small place! Next time I'm going to eat outside."}
