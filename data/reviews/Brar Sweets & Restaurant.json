{"text":"Take-away service.    (1) I had channa batura (2 batura + channa with aloo + carrot pickles/onions/wedge of lemon). It was really good and more than enough for one person. 7/10  (2) 3 samosa for $1.20. Big and filled with veggies. They came out hot and were flaky and delicious.  10/10  (3) Kalakan:  Tasty but I've had somewhat better but this could be down to personal taste, but still worth buying. 7/10  (4) Dohkla: It was okay, was a little cold and I asked if it had been made fresh that day.  I've had better Sai-Lila Khaman Dhokla in Markham.  5/10  Parking: I got there around 12.30 and found a spot but by the time I left (around 1pm) it was busy. Be careful with parking, it does get crazy.  Sitting space is limited, so get there early if you want to have lunch there and I think the music is a little too loud, if they could take it down a notch that would be great.   All in all, I really liked the food and will be back to try the thali."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in the area.  Value and quality cannot be beat.  If you're looking for an upscale ambiance, then you might want to try elsewhere.  However, if it's delicious Indian food you're feeling, then definitely check this place out.  It might not look like much from the outside, but the food is very fresh.  And there is some waiting time if you're ordering roti, since the breads are made to order, but it's soooo worth it.  I always get the thali, including the shahi paneer, palak paneer, with garlic naan.  Deeelish!"}
{"text":"Our place to go whenever we feel like not cooking. Have been going there for 4 years now and they have not changed the taste a bit. Same great taste and flavours for a very reasonable price. The stuffed parathas are the one to try out. They can and should add more drinks and new curries. It's getting boring to eat the same old ones. Rest is fantastic."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The thaali is the best option if you're interested in trying a wide variety of Indian foods. You'll get small helping of the dishes du jour and figure out what to attack the next time you're here.   Although the food quality has been consistently good, there are many better options in the same area. Regardless, Brar Sweets is a stable in this community and needs to be tried out.   The main place where Brar loses its points is their layout; it's a very small place, so you simply cannot have large parties. Some would describe it as \"intimate\", I would describe it as cramped.   TL;DR: Great food, sub-par restaurant setup. Must be tried though, it's a staple in the community."}
{"text":"one of the best around Albion/Islington area........"}
{"text":"Really good food. Needs a little work on the decor etc and staff but the food is superb :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Brar many times and I am usually very happy with my meal especially the Ras Malai but on my last visit I was not pleased. The Kofta balls were either small and hard or cold in the centre tasting like they just came out of the freezer. Also I was very sad to see that Nanaimo bars were taken off the dessert buffet the last two times I have been. Really hoping things turn around..."}
{"text":"Without question one of the best places in North America to get South Asian Sweets (Mithai).   As in good enough to go to toronto just for these sweets good.  As in good enough to replace the kamasutra as a repository of pleasure good. As in so good that everything, even the best sweet shops in NYC don't stand a chance good.  As in whenever I bring sweets from NYC (or frankly anywhere), my pops will make comparisons to brar. because in his 25 plus years in the states, nothing quite does it like brar. and i'll have to concur."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this place some stars is because one of the 5 sabzi that we tried was good.  The potato patty ( tikka) was actually spoilt.  The lady at the counter was extremely rude and unhelpful and refused to describe what each sabzi was so you have to just guess what it is.  Also she freaked and started arguing with me because she gave us two naan instead of one naan and one rotli as we asked. I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Love the thali plate. Such a great assortment of vegetarian food! Wonderful samosas also. This is a super popular local spot!"}
{"text":"I was here over lunch and got their thali. Wow it was a lot of food!  This place is fully vegetarian and some dishes were quite decent. I got palak paneer, masala choola and malae kofta. The meal also came with rice, naan, salad and desert.   The service was quick as the food was ready to choose from.   All in all decent meal for a decent price! Its worth the price!"}
{"text":"It's worth the drive to Albion!    Brar is my favourite fully-Indian spot to eat (other than my Mom's house) in the GTA.  They're 100% veg on the menu options (I'm not ACTUALLY a carnivore :P) and they've maintained their quality of food for years.  Story time.  There was a period of about 15 years when I denounced any and all things Indian.  I was trying to fit in with the kids in my classes and my surroundings and I didn't want to have ANYTHING to do with being \"different\".  Sad!  During this time period, I think I missed the mass exodus of my Indian peoples from the original Little India (Gerrard St.).  They somehow all congregated and settled in the new and improved Big-Little India (Albion/Brampton and surrounding areas - you know us Indians like to spread out and get comfy :P).  In the heart of Albion, rests Brar Sweets & Restaurant.  Their veg menu always boasts lots of great dishes, and you can pick up a box of sugary sweets on the way out.  The thali (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thali) is generally my go-to choice.  You get to taste a bit of everything (saag paneer, some type of daal, and mattar paneer are generally on deck), it comes with either one large naan or two tandoori rotis (you know you're going with the naan), and you get some chutneys / spiced onions and such on the side.    Sometimes, when I'm feeling like greasing it up and getting super lazy after this glorious food party (dear Sunday!), I switch it up and order the channa bhatura (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chole_bhature) .  This is Indian fast-food, make sure you're expecting just that when you arrive.  Similar vibes and price point (~$10) to New Bilan (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/new-bilan-restaurant-toronto), Brar Sweets & Restaurant is one of my top ethnical eateries."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the name \"Brar\"...this particular restaurant has very little in common with the infamous Brar in Brampton. Location, cleanliness are similar to most Albion area Indian restaurants....that is it is not very clean and expect sticky tables and poor customer service when you come here. I interacted with 3 employees including the cashier and food servers, no smiles and general disinterest towards the customers. The food was okay, but not as tasty as the main Brar's location. The space was very congested, despite a huge dining area right next door that was not being used (?). If you are in the area and need a hot lunch, the thali is the best option, otherwise it's worth driving to another location."}
{"text":"I cannot believe that it's a Brar's restaurant. The place is not clean. Sweets are not up to that mark. Brampton's Brar's is much much better!! If taken care then it could be a hit in Rexdale!"}
{"text":"First thing you notice when you walk in the door is the dank smell of dirty carpeting.  It is a bit of a turn off at first, until you turn the corner and see the amazing Sweets Display and take in the smell of lovely Indian spices cooking away.  I stood there for probably 5 minutes just salivating and taking in all the deliciousness in my view.  I was tempted to order one of everything but refrained.    The cashier seemed impatient, clearly used to her regular customers who know what they want (ie. not me).  It was my first visit, so I was basing what I ordered by her recommendation.  She stated \"just order the take-away box and the server at the counter will help you\".  Sounds good to me.  She then told me the total.  I took out my $20 ready to fork it over.  \"It'll be $7.90 please\".  WHAT?!  Sweet!!!!!!!  When I went over to the counter, the 2nd lady was somewhat friendly and offered her recommendations.  I ordered exactly what she recommended, and my girl didn't let me down.  It was so good.  She even offered to make fresh Naan for me if I didn't mind waiting.  Needless to say, it was way worth the wait.  My only criticism is the food was only luke-warm; could have been a bit hotter (temperature wise).  Overall, if it weren't for the smelly carpet as my first impression, I would give 5+ stars.  Unfortunately first impressions are important to me and I'm a tad shallow so I can't forgive this one aspect.    Would recommend for authentic Indian food only if you are willing to take away and not sit there to absorb the stinky carpets."}
{"text":"This location is in a small plaza with very tight parking so you don't really know what to expect at first glance. However, this has been one of those little gems that have been around for a long time with consistently good food which is always delicious. Although we have been coming here for what seems like forever, today we finally we went to eat lunch and ordered the thali and channa bhatura. I have to say the portions were plentiful, the food was fresh, and it was exactly how I remembered it. The location itself is the small Brars but if you come at the right time you can avoid the crowded tables and lineups. Brar is known for its malai kofta but in my thali we ordered the Palak paneer, shahi paneer and chili paneer with gulab Jamun. Overall, I was just as satisfied as I usually am and will definitely be back here soon!"}
{"text":"Poor hygiene, no customer service, food tastes horrible (they add artificial colors ) and its NOTHING like the Brars in Brampton. The website on their yelp page is misleading (thats the original Brar's in Brampton and is way better than this location."}
{"text":"A super clean, organized and friendly staff makes this a great place for a nice meal. We had a group of 9 that the restaurant accomodated right away. The food options were endless and every single item tasted fresh and delicious. The dessert and ice cream buffett was a huge hit with the kids. All in all, a great experience. In a land of 10,000 Indian restaurants with mediocre service, this place certainly stands apart."}
{"text":"I have been to this location before however this time we saw that there's new Brars buffet at islington ave, the service and food was too good. I loved the desserts and salads and pani puri. Everything was good and $11 was worth the money."}
{"text":"This place is DYNAMITE! I was pleasantly surprised...The atmosphere is very casual and from the outside you may not assume that the food is a delectable as it is, but I encourage you to try it out if you're in the mood for authentic, delicious indian food..."}
{"text":"A large spread of indian vegetarian food. Average taste.  Dont miss the deserts.  A no of choices and good.  They can roll a \"paan\" for you.  Not the best but at least it is available and is made in front of you."}
{"text":"**DISCLAIMER** I did not eat there today.  But I had been there many times before.  This place used to be the only game in town.  But now we have options and can go somewhere else!  Waited in line, patiently ... with one lady behind the counter - serving up sweet boxes AND in charge of the cash register.  Lady!  We are all getting older just standing in line!  Why on earth don't you guys hire more staff!!!!  Regardless - won't be running back any time soon.  Things seem to have gone downhill service-wise ... unfortunately."}
{"text":"Small joint serving cheap and tasty indian option. Must try chill paneer, chole bhatura, malai kofta. Would recommend to go for thali which is 9 bucks."}
{"text":"One of the mainstays of the Rexdale/Thistledown area. If you're looking for a cheap and decently tasty Indian food experience, this place is one to come. There are a variety of Indian curries available along with other standard Indian sweets and snacks. No other Indian restaurant in town will you spend less than $10 and come out satisfied with the food. My parents have done a take out from this restaurant numerous times and it just doesn't get any better. The service is quick and courteous. You do have to grab your own plate and water though. It is just your basic establishment, nothing special about it. Location: 8/10 (if you're not used to the area, it can feel a little dirty but I am used to it so I don't mind the smell/looks) Service: 7/10 Food quality: 8/10 Value: 10/10"}
{"text":"Love Indian food? Come here? Don't know what to get? Come here. I have been a fan of brar sweets for a while and their dining room has been revamped, into more relaxing dining experience. The food is the same buffet style servings as before.  Go enjoy something new."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that great, I won't recommend this place.  Everthing was sweet. I order veg thali with Eggplant, chilly paneer,  saag paneer, kofta instead of sweet.  I purchased few sweets separately,  sweets were not fresh and they were stale. I will never visit this place again.  Tables are dirty and the place is not maintained properly. If you want to try brar then you should visit Brampton location."}
{"text":"It is sometimes hard to believe that all the food is here is vegetarian.  The food is tasty and so fresh.  The pakoras... yum!  So crispy!  The curries - to ie for!  And the Indian sweets.  I've never had jalebi or barfi this fresh before in my life (granted, I've always wanted to go to India.).  Usually, if you go to other Indian places in North Etobicoke, their sweets will taste oddly like samosas or some mix of 3 day old Indian food.  Not at Brar!  Thumbs up all around.    Side note: the Indian place next door is terrible.  Do not go there.  I think the only reason they are in business is because the lineups at Brar Sweets are too long and people assume that they'll get equally as good food.  Not so."}
{"text":"Brar is a great place to go if you're with a large group of friends who all want to gorge themselves on obscene amounts of Indian buffet. It's completely vegetarian and there are literally hundreds of food choices to make. Watch out for the breaded cheese balls as they'll quickly fill you up - they are super addictive. You can easily go back six, seven times to fill up your plate with entirely different items. And that's before you've even glanced at dessert.  Whoa."}
{"text":"Best food in area Everything is perfect Drinks are best mainly mango lassi ..also try veg thali,pav bhaji,paranthas"}
