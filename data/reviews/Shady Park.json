{"text":"Ugh, where to start?  Probably should kick off the review by pointing out that Shady Park's \"rules\" clearly state \"Yelpers not welcome\". So, they have that going on. It's obvious to me now why they don't want reviews... their pizza is horrible.  THE GOOD - VIBE The ambiance, the vibe, the decor is all awesome! One person at our table commented that it was reminiscent of a 1970's bowling alley or basement. To me, the decor had a retro-70s-modern-neighborhood-bar thing going on. Definitely very cool. Large tables, open spaces, comfy chairs.  The lone server was doing the best she could during the lunch rush (mid-week during baseball season in downtown Tempe).  I blame the management for any inattentiveness. The bartender helped out when he could as well.  THE BAD - PIZZA To call themselves a \"pizzaria\" is astonishing. Maybe the \"lunch special\" pizza is different from what they normally serve, but it was barely passable to me. It's somewhere between a cracker-crust and a thin-crust. Not much meat on it. The sauce is not horrible, but tastes a bit like a straight marinara and not a special pizza sauce. Don't judge the actual product based on the photos on Facebook. It's on par with Totinos Party Pizzas.  THE BAD - LUNCH SPECIAL My coworkers and I went to check out their lunch special: All you can eat pizza and salad for $7.99.  They bill it as a \"Quick Serve Lunch\".  Ha ha hah. If they don't have anything else, at least they have a sense of humor. Their all-you-can-eat process baffles the mind. They serve you a \"quarter\" pizza at a time.  Sounds ok, I guess.  Order up.  The odd thing is: they only COOK a quarter at a time. They apparently slice a raw pizza into portions and cook to order the slice you're getting. I think the point is that you can \"mix and match\" your slices as you go.  So, get this... 3 people ordering pizza for lunch... 2 get pepperoni, and 1 gets sausage.  I scarfe down my \"quarter\" of pepperoni pretty quickly and wait 5 minutes for the server to get back around and by this time we all order a sausage for 2nd round... assuming that the other 3/4 of my co-workers quarter sausage from earlier is already cooked, we should get our pizza quick.  No such luck. Two of us waited about 10 minutes for our second round, the third person a few minutes more. Presumably because they had to cook them from raw. It's just a bizarre process, but I guess it works for them to manage costs, if not customer satisfaction. They only offer 5 pizzas for the lunch special, so you think they'd cook at least a few of the basics to be ready.  The salad was simply lettuce with green olives and tomatoes. I don't think there was even any onion. The first round of service was normal, assuming a fresh cooked pizza.  THE PROBABLY GOOD - PARTY TIME Judging by the photos on Facebook, it looks like a great place for the college crowd to drink beers and watch live music.  SUMMARY I hope they change their pizza or process. I'd like to see them succeed, it looks like a groovy place to hang and props to them for hosting live, local music.  I'd consider going back to try their sandwiches, I saw one go by and it looked great. Unfortunately, none of my co-workers are interested in going back."}
{"text":"fuck this place!! terrible service everyone was rude and had an attitude. wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"If I had the option to give this establishment 0 starts I would with no question. I have never received such terrible & aggressive service from anywhere in my life. This is a kind warming to all of the girls out there...the bouncers here are not afraid to put their hands on you. They will push you and grab you and kick you out for any reason. I woke up with bruises the next day. All of their employees are beyond rude and sexist. They refuse to try and resolve any issues customers might have and avoid confrontation towards complaints made against them. Take your service elsewhere."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. Arrived to watch an NFL game and the place had exactly 5 people in it, we were quickly greeted by a cocky bartender informing us that most of the tables were reserved and they have a $300 min for a table but it includes a bottle of champagne and pizza. Thanks bud, that's just what I want while watching a football game in a college town, a bottle of champagne. Can't image this dump will be open long. They are missing the market in Tempe. It's not a strip club, why the Champagne and mins on a table to watch a football game that you could barely see due to the glare on the screen.. Please save your money and go to Zipps to watch a game. Maybe its better in the night as a club but I will not be returning. To many better options for my money."}
{"text":"Very nice place in terms of scenery. Open areas and shade. However, it took five minutes just to get a menu, and then ten minutes after that was dropped off, still no one taking our drink order. Went inside to just sit at the bar so I could actually get service, and lo and behold, the bartender did not input my food order so my meal never showed up. There were 8 tables total being served, 2 servers, a manager, and a bartender. If this is \"so busy\" as one of the servers told me, that is pretty darn sad. Two stars because of the scenery. Sad that the service was very sub par"}
{"text":"We LOVE Shady Park and their ramen is our absolute favorite, we've tried other places and they just do not compare. Unfortunately the 4 stars vs. the 5 stars would be because since they just added sushi to their menu, they have removed items that we loved, and they also have changed things around timing wise. From 3-5, if you are craving ramen, you're going to have to go elsewhere because this is the time that they remake their stocks. (We know... we were shocked too considering this is prime time when people are getting off work and are very hungry) Hoping the time for that changes, or there are some adjustments made, because it is disappointing having to leave and come back 2 hours later for the ramen, although worth it."}
{"text":"They got rid of their boneless wings. Only reason I came here- that and the $5 pitcher of the day, which they also don't have any more. Their \"personal pizza\" is $8 but that's just w cheese. Extra toppings, extra $$. Go to Blaze instead- great pizza and free extra toppings. Very disappointed. Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Vibes are great, service is awesome, food is good, really large selection of beers, but most importantly Andrew is the coolest guy ever and is always making our time here inviting and enjoyable."}
{"text":"This review is only based on the shows they have. I was stoked when shady first opened seeing as it was an outside venue. So far they have hosted some amazing music artists but the sad thing is the sound quality. First show was nice and loud and from there is all when down hill. Was just there 6/24 for Rezz and the music wasn't nearly as loud as it should have been. Don't book people that play loud music if you're not gonna turn it up, ruins the whole experience. I could have had louder music in my own house. Why good is a Pk sound system if you're not gonna use it!?"}
{"text":"Such an awesome venue for a music show! Really cool concept and the floor is sloped so you can actually see! Awesome time there, glad to know Tempe has a new music spot!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars just because the Ramen is incredible. Unfortunately the bartender had a real bad attitude and treated me like crap for no apparent reason both times I've been in to pick up an order, which is why I won't be back. Sorry guys, your food rocks but your bartender ruined it for me big time. I don't usually leave negative reviews especially in multiple review sites, I understand the service industry very well and usually give a pass when people aren't great and it's typically a one off event. I get it. Both times though? Won't be subjecting myself to that a third time. However, the guy that brings out the pickup order is pleasant"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, I always get the ramen. But the reason I give two stars is the service. It is always slow, terrible, never friendly, the waitresses are usually hanging out by the cash register chit-chatting and are barely attentive to customers. I go here at least once a week. The ramen takes at least a half hour every time I order it, which is ridiculous. Ramen takes ten minutes. This place would be top notch if they had better staff. Poorly run."}
{"text":"Great food and entertainment. Menu online needs updating as I was looking forward to having some things that are no longer on the menu. Food is cooked fast and can hold a large group in the outside dining area. They have plenty of misters when it's hot. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place certainly has a great amount of potential. But since opening this past year doesn't live up to it. The pizza is pretty delicious after you have knocked a few back. On Thursdays they have a deal in which you pay $10 for 2 slices of pizza and $1 drinks. They have a decent crowd on these nights and occasionally have local EDM artists performing. Not a bad place to spend a Thursday evening. But it's no Jefe."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE SERVICE.  1. Inattentive staff. We had to flag our waitress down several times before she finally brought us water or the bill. The waitress knew nothing of the menu, and couldn't answer any of our questions about the dinner special.   2. Inappropriate timing of food delivery. We ordered ramen, sushi, and sashimi. The ramen came out within a few minutes, the sushi came out 15 min later, and the sashimi came out 30 min after the ramen. No explanation was given for why the sashimi took so long.  3. Incorrect billing. The waitress first billed me incorrectly, then went back and \"fixed\" the bill. On my credit card statement, I now have 2 bills: one for a few dishes (that should have been removed), and one for the entire party!   4. Mediocre food. To add insult to injury, the ramen, sashimi, and sushi were merely mediocre. There was nothing special about any particular dish.   We will NEVER be returning to this place, unless they change their horrible service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"I've had the food from this spot on a few different occasions but yesterday was my first time eating in. The food is good, not out of this world, \"slap your mama\" good but definitely tasty and a good value. They have a $6 lunch special that includes an entire 8\" pizza (1 topping) and a drink, that's crazy value! The service could improve but it suits the dive bar atmosphere. I understand that they are closing for renovations next week, I'm excited to see what the new Shady Park vibe will be!"}
{"text":"We had a great time.  This restaurant will be popular because it is a great venue.  There is much thought and great design invested into this entertainment concept.  Go here to eat pizza, wings and have a cold one and witness the true essence of downtown Tempe life surrounded by the uniqueness and presence of Arizona State University people.  Sent from my iPhone"}
{"text":"I had the spicy shoyu ramen house bowl with egg added and it did not disappoint. I think it could get pricey creating your own bowls and adding on toppings, but with unlimited 1$ sake-bombers during happy hour you can afford to go a little nuts!  it's worth noting that I've been here for shows after the restaurant closes, and it's a really fun venue. Drinks are definitely not 1$ during the shows though, ouch."}
{"text":"The hands down the best place in Tempe. Awesome food, killer patio, and great shows. Pizza is bomb and it's probably the best Ramen I've ever had. This place is a must try in Tempe"}
{"text":"This venue is cool but the communication from the staff was brutal and that ruined our evening.  Drove the 30 minutes to the venue last night to go see some live music with my son (10 years old) and braved the lousy parking situation.  Once into the venue with my son (again, he's clearly under 21) we had two employees approach us.  What follows is the agonizing interaction with Employees 1 and 2:   E1: \"After 10 PM no one under 21 can come in\"   Me: \"Well that's ok, it's only 9:20\"   E1: \"Ok, um, well just keep him close to you, please.\"   Me: \"Sure.\"   Three minutes later Employee 2 (with a radio) approached me:   E2: \"Sir, this is a 21 and over show\"   Me: \"Yeah, no one told me that.  I called and checked earlier today and was told we could come and then I checked all your websites (your website and Facebook) as well.  Also, the guy who just checked us in said nothing about him being here and let us in with a smile?\"   E2: \"He was incorrect and our website says that this show is 21 and over\"   Me: \"Nope.  It doesn't.\"   E2: \"But if we get to capacity we can't have anyone under 21\"   Me: \"Are you at capacity right now?  There's an awful lot of open area on this patio.\"   E2: \"Well...no.  But we expect to get to capacity at some point tonight.\"   Me: \"Ok, so can we stay until you reach capacity?  We'll stand right there on the side of the stage to watch for a bit.  We'll leave once you get to capacity\"   E2: \"No.  Because we are going to get to capacity\"   Me: \"I don't understand.  It's before 10 PM and you're not even at half of your capacity but you're asking us to leave?  This doesn't make any sense.\"   E2: \"Because we're going to get to capacity and we can't have anyone under 21 when we're at capacity\"   I felt like Alice in Wonderland just being talked around in circles.  The employees never got combative but they were frustrated that I presented them with logic.  So my son and I got a 60 minute round trip car ride to not get to see any live music.  That stinks."}
{"text":"Your welcome. You can get pizza here, some drinks and stuff. Has a nice patio with with a LCD TV. Cool stuff"}
{"text":"Shady park seems like a great place to go for a drink and to watch game or a show. But don't let yourself get ripped off by their food prices. We went for the ramen, only to be told they don't serve ramen between 3pm-5pm. We then decided to order the sashimi bowl... thinking it would be a bowl of assorted fish... and instead a bowl with rice, raw veggies, and 5 slices of yellowtail... for $18!!! My boyfriend and I were blown away. $18??? We ate it because we were starving at this point, but we should have sent it back because it's a huge rip off. We also got the yakitori which is not barbecued at all... the waiter even said \"yeah it's great they make in this cool cast iron pan...\". Definitely not traditional yakitori as it was not made over an open flame and had some strange Asian BBQ sauce on it. Definitely won't go back for food."}
{"text":"I have come to Shady Park a decent amount of times since their grand opening with the service being relatively okay. However, this visit will surely be my last.   After looking over the menu I decided to order a beer and a roll of sushi (let me clarify) ONE roll of sushi, and my friend decided to get some ramen. After about 10 mins go by, they bring out the ramen but no sushi. I wasn't in a huge rush so no worries - I understand it can get busy in the kitchen. Five mins go by, then ten, then 15, and finally 20. By this time my friend had completely finished his meal, I had finished my beer, and the hour of parking I paid for was 10 mins to expiring.   Let me also add, halfway through my friend eating, they decided to ask for ID as they wanted to open up the partition between the patio and restaurant. He's only 20 but this issue shouldn't arise halfway through a paying customers meal.  My server, Sage, had came to our table several times during this wait amazed I still didn't have my food and actually checked back to the kitchen 2-3 times for me before I finally received it (she was great). But I have never in my life had to wait 30 mins for a roll of sushi.   Upon receiving my food, the manager decides to come over to explain how ramen takes two mins to make while sushi somehow takes 30 mins (because it's an \"entree\" and somehow ramen isn't?) - all he could say was \"I understand, BUT...\". All he needed to say was, \"I apologize is there anything I can do to make it better?\" - that would have made the difference between me writing this yelp review or not.  He offered me free edamame but seeing as I had just gotten my \"entree\" and had finished my beer, I countered the offer by asking if they could refill my glass so I had something to enjoy my meal with; he begrudgingly accepted. However, when I got the bill I was charged $8 for a draft beer - even if I had gone to a club up the street I would have paid max $5.50 to $6 for the same product accompanied by better service, and better management. I paid the bill, tipped the waitress and got out of there before anything else could go wrong. All in all, this place is a JOKE. Please, if you're trying to enjoy your evening DO NOT go to this \"restaurant.\""}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite place in Tempe! Ramen is amazing, the new sushi menu is spectacular!! Our waiter Spencer was outstanding! He was so on top of our large party of 10. Splitting our checks and not forgetting 1 item we ordered!! We will all be coming back. We had a wonderful experience here. Thank you Spencer and thank you shady park for being so amazing to us!"}
{"text":"The fried zucchini was fantastic, we ordered two pizzas, The Green and a sausage/pepperoni and both were fantastic! Thin crust and tons of flavor! $5 glasses of Wine some pinball in a cool 1970's basement vibe?? I'll take it!!"}
{"text":"Awful service. It was a Saturday, but still pretty bad. We sat looking weird for almost 30 minutes waiting for our drinks. The mixed drinks were over priced for what they were, and just not great. The ramen was on point. I think it would be awesome if the ramen was it's own thing, it's the best part about this place."}
{"text":"This place will always have a special place in my heart because of all the great shows I've been to there. Also I was lucky enough to score 2 free tickets to see Giraffage perform there because I had come in the night before for some pizza. I have yet to have a bad night at an event at this venue. 4 Stars because there pizza is good but their ramen is too salty."}
{"text":"Love their ramen! The vegan noodle is absolutely amazing. I recommend getting this and adding spinach and spicy garlic paste. Also they have great deals on saki bombs. The large is plenty for 2 people."}
{"text":"Server met us when we came in and explained menu. Ordered two rolls off their happy hour menu. Portions were small and the rice was very dry. I think there are far better sushi places in the Tempe area for less."}
{"text":"Great food. Super cool environment.  The wait staff is usually understaffed (probably in an effort to make sure they are making decent tips) which is admirable and understandable but the delays can get out of hand sometimes... 15 minutes waiting to be acknowledged this time!!!!  Poor  staffing can be a bit annoying some times.   DONT forget GREAT FOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Their ramen is legit and their sake bomb specials were great. I will definitely be returning here as their ramen is some of the best I've had in Tempe, maybe in all of Arizona."}
{"text":"Such a bomb place! Has the best music and drinks. If you find yourself looking for a great bartender/manager ask for Vinny or Patrick. They will treat you like gold. Ask any questions they will tell you where to go. Honestly they are the best tour guides in Tempe and the also serve great food! Have you ever had shady parks sushi? It's bomb"}
{"text":"Shady park has definitely been a recent favorite! I feel that not many restaurants can serve pizza, ramen, AND sushi and nail each one. The menu has plenty of delicious options as well as a nice vegan selection too, all at reasonable prices. Try the vegan pizza! Overall awesome food and drink specials and variety. The location itself is right off Mill Ave. and a great place to start the night or just hang out with friends. The dim lighting, multiple seating options (indoor, outdoor, booths, tables, and bar), and cool music have brought me back multiple weeks in a row....(guilty!) The servers are awesome people and always friendly. Personal shout out the Patrick for being an awesome guy!   -I have yet to attend BUT I do know they often have DJ's and other unique artists in their back yard area for small concerts pretty often. I've seen tickets ranging from $12-$15.   Gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"I love this location - for the pizza and for Umami Ramen. Great drink specials, too. The many different spaces also make this a great place to meet a small group of friends or hang out on the weekends.   Have also held large events with these guys and while they aren't perfect in the execution, they will make sure that they make up for their mistakes right away. That goes a long way with me."}
{"text":"The service was pretty slow and awkward. The table themselves were not clean and presentable. Ordered miso soup and was very disappointed in the presentation, did not look appetizing and was very disgusted by it. Also the cups were dirty and just eating there made me feel sick."}
{"text":"I've walked and driven past this spot for a while now, so I was very excited when some friends invited us out to go try it for dinner! The atmosphere was fun for an early evening meal. We sat outside on the shaded patio.  On an initial glance at the menu, it's almost surprising to see such a variety of foods - sushi, ramen, pizza, and sandwiches don't seem to mix together, but I think it's great to offer a wide variety for guests. We ordered drinks, a sushi roll for the table, some friends ordered ramen, and the one who wasn't a fan of ramen was able to order something that she knew she would like!  I usually prefer my ramen to be light and healthier, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they offer a variety of options! You can \"build your own\" ramen bowl, or order a suggested house bowl. I opted for a grilled chicken ramen, and it was exactly what I needed! Flavorful, light, a variety of colors. I felt that they successfully pulled off a fusion of Asian and American flavors. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Elyssa is amazing! Me and my coworkers came in after we got laid off and she told us that us was happy hour all day (only on mondays) and she told her manager and then proceeded to give us 50% off our bill. Love it!!"}
{"text":"What a cool, dog friendly spot in Downtown Tempe! We came here for a fun charity event the other night and were pleasantly surprised by the cool atmosphere {pun intended - they had misters!!}, delicious pizza, cold beers from the outside bar, and all in all, just a fun place to hang out! Their pizza had super thin crust and I loved it. It was almost like a cracker which meant I ate a TON of pieces because it was light and tasty. I loved the red sauce that they put on it. Our sheepie had a blast as well. We've been looking for fun new spots to take him so we'll absolutely be back to Shady Park when the weather gets a bit nicer - 117 is still a little too hot for us, misters and all. They do have an indoor restaurant as well. Thank you for a great Friday night, Shady Park. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I just ate here and I must say their lunch special deal is unbelievable. Eight dollars for really high-quality pizza, all you can eat... What seems made fresh every time you order. I have zero complaints... This will definitely be a frequent daytime stop for me when I want a good beer, nice patio and really fresh high quality pizza"}
{"text":"...Ever had their vegan wings? It'll change your life.  This is one of my favorite places on Mill. Not only is it a dynamic restaurant with several different flavors and styles of food, but there's also live music."}
{"text":"Service absolutely horrendous every time-Guaranteed.  Too loud. Not for you if you are trying to eat and talk with friends  Vegan pizza options are gone.  Walked out this time and no more chances for us.  Zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Shady Park for awhile now! It always looked packed driving by at night, and I'm familiar with their live music. The restaurant itself has an indoor park theme to it. Dim inside, and few patio lights outside. I love how the south entrance of Shady Park incorporates the Chinese lanterns to make obvious that it serves oriental.  It is unfortunate though that there is limited rear parking. Parking should be made more clearly on the website, especially of where to enter.  Inside the restaurant though, everything is wooden or bench like, simulating a park and stools with outdoor cushions. What really interested me was the back patio. The patio is open seating and is fairly large! There was a stage and I found out that open mic nights are held at 8 on Mondays. The music playing was a shuffle of old pop song and thankfully, it was not too loud for conversations. The setting is very welcoming and it does create a calm mood and very laid back. The employees match the environment. Relaxed and easy going.   I walked in around 3 and there was only a bartender and server left. It did not seem like the server was that busy, but it did take a bit of time for her to check in. Though when we made eye contact with her, she would work her way over to us. Water came in this large pitcher. When it was empty, the server did not offer to replace it. The pitcher was not enough for the three of us. When deciding, we were given plenty of time and did not feel rushed by our server. She helped us decide quickly when we were stumped and answered all of our questions about the menu. She recommended the chicken parmesan sandwich for my friend and he loved it.   All of our food arrived hot from the kitchen at the same time. I ordered the Miso Hungry Ramen Bowl with a side of Kimchi. The broth itself was pretty salty, but overall the ramen was like others I have tried. Disclaimer: there is only one Unami in that dish.  I was under the impression that the House Ramen included meat, but I guess that it is only for the build your own bowls.The kimchi came in a small dish, which surprised me because a it was four dollars. It was not completely separated from its head, so I had to separate most of it myself. My ramen portion was decently sized. Honestly, I thought the pizza was the best out of all our entrees. It is unfortunate that there were no other size options for the pizzas. The signature pizzas all come as sixteen inch Chicago style thin crust. We tried the Backyard BBQ. My friend who ordered it was still hungry after eating it! That's where they get you though with the thin crust.   The menu is a little overpriced. The Backyard BBQ was $23, which most of the others were. The ramen, which is cheaper at competing restaurants who specialize in ramen (Ramen Republic) are cheaper, especially with add ons. Kimchi was priced at $4 and is priced $1 somewhere else. Sake bombs are only a dollar though with a food purchase. After we finished our meals the plates were cleared away quickly and our server presented the bill shortly after. I feel like service could be a little friendlier, but was not disappointed by the food and the atmosphere. Will definitely come back for the live music and food! Great place to socialize with the colleagues!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and boy let me tell you about their \"spicy tan tan men\" ramen dish. This ish is amazing!   I usually get it with fried chicken, a soft boiled egg, extra noodles, and butter.   Heaven is a place in Earth and a piece of that is at Shady Park. Lol.  I'm almost scared to try anything else but it's probably all good.   Nice place, nice location, good vibes, and pretty clean. I also hear they do some crazy EDM events on the weekends. Might check it out sometime."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE going here on Saturdays. Our friends DJ here often, and the drinks are always delicious and the food is to die for. Only one problem- the misters aren't on when it's hot as balls outside.. If there are 2/300 people in one location OUTSIDE and it's still 100 degrees at 11/12pm, why on earth would they put the misters on in 10 minute intervals and not constantly? I will still attend any show that I can, but I will remember to wear almost no clothes so I don't die of heat exhaustion."}
{"text":"Came here and had the ramen, fried calamari, two cocktails and a beer.   It's a good thing the ramen was great, because of the rest of it really wasn't. It's hard to cook calamari the right length of time, and this was overcooked. The cocktails were insipid. The beer was fantastic. The service was good, once we were discovered."}
{"text":"We decided to come to Shady Park on Friday after work to check this place out...and we loved it!  The atmosphere is great - relaxing and so laid back and who doesn't love live music on a Friday afternoon on the outdoor patio?  They have a really nice beer/cider selection and the prices are really reasonable.  We will definitely be back and Shady Park will be added to our rotation of cool places to hang out and have some drinks!"}
{"text":"review is for shady park not umami. friend had at least 4 fruit flies in the bottom of his manhattan cocktail.. they replaced his drink but still charged him for the initial drink, all the while having stingy attitudes. fuck that.  even before that happened they were very uninviting and our server completely forgot to put our drink orders in. wasn't busy. food was okay, about 3 stars worth. go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Lunch with my sister, this wasn't our first choice as the Chuck box was packed but shady Park was close to where we parked. Inside was interesting, a little retro, and divey. We where surprised that it's Italian and Japanese food... Just strange. Waiter informed us that they were out of the vegan chicken wings.... THANK GOODNESS! That sounds terrible.  The regular boneless wings were very good though as was the pizza   The downside to eating here is that it is too hot inside because they don't seem to have AC and the entrance and back patio stay open during the day"}
{"text":"I here been coming here ALL the time for over a year. We have definitely had a few service issues (hence the 4 stars) but the food is BY FAR the best ramen in Tempe, probably the valley too ?   Service: once we waited literally 1 hour for our check. Our waitesss left without telling us and then we asked someone else for it (15 mins in) and then they forgot (?) and then we just kept waiting. We're kind of awkward I guess ? we started timing it at one point because it just got ridiculous. No one came to talk to us! For an hour! The girl eventually remembered and brought it and apologized but didn't give a discount or anything? Not sure what's normal but she just said sorry and then we left. Other times the waitstaff have just been inattentive and even rude. I would say 30% of the time our waiter makes us uncomfortable or does something janky but generally it's okay!   Food:  pork belly is pricey but it is worth it! I always also for the moister stuff (once it was so dry I couldn't eat it so now I always ask). I get the build your own with Paitan and Pork Belly  if you aren't sure what to get-- just get that. I always ask for chili oil and then basically dump it on  if you're into the miso flavor, I also recommend the miso hungry, with pork belly if you are into that.   We've only gotten sushi once and it just okay. I would stick to the ramen tbqh."}
{"text":"They have vegan wings. And vegan ramen. Can't get any better than that. Service has usually been decent, but the hours are weird and you can't get ramen all the time. Call ahead to make sure they're serving food you want. Happy hour was also good; great sushi!"}
{"text":"Shady Park is a really cool spot! It's right off Mill Ave. in Tempe, so you get the nightlife and bar scene mixed with great food!  They have recently expanded their ramen menu so now it's considered \"SUPER Umami.\" Basically, they have even more noodle bowls, sushi, and a great selection of Japanese beers and sake.  I was impressed with my ramen bowl, but I would also love to try the pizza. A nearby table ordered a thin crust pizza that looked amazing.  The atmosphere here is also great. It has an indoor-outdoor feel and is dog friendly.  Beware: Parking is rough. Be prepared to pay to park or walk a few blocks! Typical Mill Ave. situation."}
{"text":"I go to many shows and events at this venue and I always have a great time! The vibes of the place are always fun and positive. The trees and stage set up make it feel like an awesome backyard BBQ party! You'd think with a mostly outdoor venue, that the sound would be bad but their sound system is actually pretty dang great! If you are respectful to everyone there, you will have no issues. The security guys are so much fun and make sure everyone is in line and safe. The food here is also super yummy!   The only lame thing is that drink prices are quite steep, but if they are doing the special where a portion of the money made goes towards charity; it makes it seem not so bad. Also the bathrooms are always very hot and crowded on busy nights, seems like they did not expect a large amount of ppl using the bathroom at this place! Other than those things, it's amazing! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I love Maddie #1, she's always smiling, dancing and creating a positive vibe. Vinnie the bartender is equally as awesome. Quick and friendly service  Cant wait to meet the rest of the staff"}
{"text":"It was all fun and games until I checked my bank account and the lovely waitress who didn't even do a good job took my money. First, I gave her cash, which was only a dollar short of the total amount and then she told me I still owed her $3. I let it slide because I still needed to tip her, but then when I got the bill she took it before I filled out the receipt and sure enough she charged me an extra dollar. Sure it was only a dollar more, but on principle that is just unprofessional and rude and I cannot believe anyone would do something like that. Needless to say I will not be returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"This little place is so cool! Came with some of my coworkers to have lunch and our awesome server, Elyssa, was such a sweetheart! Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"So bummed! I loved this restaruant until I was served by Paul.  I used to come here all the time because of the amazing food and the $1 saki bombs. Unfortunately, Paul decided to implement a new rule that only allowed me to have 2 saki bombs at a time. I was here with my family for a grad dinner and he cut my mom and I off after only 2 saki bombs! Very disappointed as I have come here multiple times and have had more than one. Safe to say I will be requesting a new server if I come across Paul, the manager, again."}
{"text":"Cool Little Off The Main Drag Spot  Ashley was our server and she was friendly.   We got Eel Roll and the Salmon Rolls while having a night out with friends beginning... They were a 3.5 out of 5... I felt like they were slightly dry and small portioned but not bad. You need to order 2-3 rolls per full sized man though...  The location is one that could easily be missed and never even noticed. I had never noticed until Darren told us about it...   All in all it's probably cool when live music is going since they have a huge back area for music..."}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio. Good ramen. Good pizza. Good drink specials. And they ain't shady with their portions either. Cannot ask for more. Happy customer:)"}
{"text":"Beware buying concert tickets!!!!! Bought Goldfish tickets way back. SHADY PARK avertised as 9pm show. Came here, had dinner and drinks. Finally wondered where the band was. They told us the band is only coming on at 12.30pm. Totally mislead everyone here who was waiting to see Goldfish! The girl at check in was totally rude about it too. Didn't even apologize for the stuff up."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall.  Literally.  Chill spot. Ramen soba etc. Just a vibe more than anything. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Eminem - The Real Slim Shady)  Cause I'm gonna Yelp Shady, yes the real Shady Park All you Yelp at Mill Shady Park are just salivating So won't you come to Shady Park please step up Please step up, please step up?   I found Shady Park to be a sweet cool spot.  Awesome patio with live music and spacious.  I didn't see it, but I was told an arcade is going to be in the middle spot as you enter from the back into the main bar and dining room!  Pizza and Ramen!?  From what I gathered; what a weird combo, but I guess that's what you get when you're in the heart of college town.  My group and I started with some drinks; Peanut Butter Porter; hell yeah!  For our food I shot for their special of the night; The Spicy Shoyu.  The Spicy Shoyu was indeed spicy for my taste.  Red spicy broth with ramen noodles topped with roasted pork and scallions.  I added an egg to mines to give some texture.  Overall, the amount of heat overtook a lot of what I wanted to taste and eat.  The pork itself became soggy after a while and everything just became mushy!    In the end, Shady Park seems like a cool concept, but for next time I'll shoot for the pizza and see how it is.  The service was good and the atmosphere was chill and cool.  I would definitely come back just to grab a drink or two with friends, but not too sure about their ramen! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I place here 2 stars... not particularly because of the food but specifically because of the service! I came by Shady Park today because i heard about the Pizza Promotion. I was genuinely excited to try this new place because i live in the nearby area and thought it might be something i can introduce to others. So on my lunch break today my co-worker, friend and I decided to drive from work and check it out. When we got there we stood in line for about 10 min, as we approached the front of the line i could not help but overhear the young woman standing in front speak negatively about customers. We got to the window and i could better hear her say \"These bums aren't getting served again\". I assumed she was talking about someone trying to get a second helping but also the establishment is right next to a Salvation Army where plenty of homeless people hang out so her comments could be directed and perceived in many ways. I thought this was incredibly uncalled for, for her to pass her judgments and negativity on others especially when she is supposed to primarily be there to promote positive interaction and be the face of the establishment.  However, this is not the worst part... after standing in line waiting patiently for our serving my co-worker and I received our pizza and my friend not particularly wanting a pizza continued to wait along side us. The young woman as we were getting our pizza turns to our friend and proceeds to wrongfully accuse him of already being in line. He tried to explain to her how this was incorrect and how this was his first time there. She proceeded to argue and be outwardly rude with him in front of everyone. She was extremely unreasonable and inconsiderate and ended up telling him \"I guess you can have a pizza...even though i already gave you one\". Fed up with her attitude and her accusations he just gave it back. She was totally in the wrong for accusing him and subjecting him to her comments out of no where. Management should take notice to this individual because guaranteed her attitude will have negative repercussions. If the objective today was to get people to talk about your establishment then your employee ensured that to happen but probably not in the way you would like.   Shady Park is definitely throwing some Shade that's for sure! So we will probably not return there and will most likely advocate for others to not waste their time either, which sucks because their menu looked pretty good but it would taste alot better without the disrespect."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a couple times for ramen. The concept of this place is a little goofy. There are three restaurants combined into one or something. Not really sure. I have only had their ramen.  I got pork, corn, tofu, and egg ramen every time. Was very solid, but expensive once everything was added in. Parking is definitely an issue and having ramen as a sit down place is unusual to me. Definitely above average ramen though and worth a try."}
{"text":"They are not serving ramen, they ran out of sake, and that's why we came.  Wish we weren't crunched for time so we could go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hidden gem best describes this place. Great indoor and outdoor environments, the food is amazing and the level of musical talent brought here is impressive. If you haven't checked this place out yet, what are you waiting for? Did I mention a 140\"+ screen for game days?"}
{"text":"Incredible ramen, great atmosphere! This was a place I frequented in college, and still go whenever I can. :)"}
{"text":"my review is on the venue from a concert attendee perspective.  I actually really liked the space, but unfortunately, I had to give this venue two stars for all the secondhand smoke I inhaled for the duration of the concert. It's not a super big space, they have it set up like it's backyard patio-type of vibe. with a show on the weekend it gets packed and so you have people less than 3-5 feet away from you, smoking up cigarettes. I get that it's \"outdoors\", but it sucks that you have to be subjected to increasing your exposure to secondhand smoke. I will have to think long and hard before i come back to Shady Park for another show in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout because the restaurant had a very \"cheap bar\" atmosphere. The waiter assured that this ramen was the best in Arizona, but when I tried it I loved the pork belly, (2 dollar upcharge) but the broth could have been better."}
{"text":"The place is nice, the people are nice and its super convenient when you want a hot meal on campus. But their ramen broth is way too salty for me. I have tried 3 of their noodle soups but have not been able to finish them. I sample Japanese food everywhere I go, so this is kind of heart breaking for me. Also, their sushi was fine but nothing special. Save your money, so some place else. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I rarely give yelp reviews, but when I do it's because I've been reminiscing about how delicious the food/experience was days later. I order chicken parm sandwich, A+++ the bread is perfect and I love the cheese sprinkled on top of the bread. My boyfriend ordered ramen and he loved everything about it as well. Gyoza was also great! Thanks shady park for a great meal!"}
{"text":"Took this girl there and we tried to dance and they threw her out we're really unruly refuse to let us pay for our own bill just unruly grabbed her by the arm the worst security staff I've ever seen I would never go back there again at that place that place belongs in the trailer park"}
{"text":"Love their project x party feel with the backyard bar and hanging lights. They have comedy shows and live music! Pizza is good and drinks are 5 bucks. It is dog friendly as well! The ramen you get from inside is not as great as every one said but that is the only bad thing I can say. Never had any problems at shady park and all employees are laid back and understanding,"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Their food is great with lots of vegan and vegetarian options. It's also a cool music venue that makes me feel like I'm in Austin. The only downside for me is that I used to CRAVE the vegan wings but they recently changed them and they're now more like mozzarella sticks. Kinda stinks because they're no longer craveable. Please please go back to the old style. Then it would be 4/5."}
{"text":"I have been a resident of downtown Tempe for about seven years now. As such, I've seen dozens of restaurants come and go, especially on/right off of Mill Ave. Shady Park is the third restaurant that has occupied this space in my short tenure here, but it catches the Tempe vibe SO WELL. It is a staple of our experience living here. It catches the grunge/70s vibe well without you being fearful of your life. If you love Cornish Pasty, you'll love this place.  Food: My husband and I are vegetarian/vegan and they have SO MANY options for us. And they're all incredible! The vegan ramen, vegan fish tacos, and vegan hoagie are all amazing! (We we're Carnivores a year ago and loved their meat based options too! Try the Miso Hungry ramen!)  Service: A+ bartenders who have really stuck around since the place opened. We always get what we ordered and fairly quickly. We tend to sit at the bar but it's open seating everywhere (no host/hostess) and have always had good experiences with the servers!  The atmosphere is super chill, inside and on the patio (front and back). It has an open feel to it with the raddest little retrofitted bus out back that you can reserve. Honestly if you like cool local hangout spots I highly recommend this place. We love Shady!!! (PS prices are super fair too!)"}
{"text":"Been dying to come to Shady Park because of the DJ's they book. Love the set up! Its beautiful! Kind of difficult to find but the music was on point!"}
{"text":"Shady has gone through ebbs and flows for sure and is now on an uptick.   As a vegetarian who eats vegan as much as possible, Shady has some incredible and delicious options. My go to is their ramen with vegan broth and the regular (vegetarian) noodles, so much flavor, perfectly chewy noodles, and satisfying as hell.   Lately they've unveiled vegan fish tacos (incredible), and a vegan hoagie (omfg), that add to the vegan ramen and vegan wings they already had, that are both great.   With really good specials for meat eaters and veg heads alike, solid staffing and a sweet place in general, Shady is a regular of ours that we brag to any and all that we can."}
{"text":"Shady Park is a great place right off of Mill Ave and University. Their ramen bowls are great, so much flavor. The pizza was also good, thin crust and cheesy. Staff was friendly and the atmosphere was laid back, patios front and back. Great place to go on a Sunday afternoon, parking is a pain as always."}
{"text":"I went in to shady park the other day, not only was their ramen amazing but our server, Maddy, was absolutely amazing. She was bubbly, timely and extremely competent. I can't go on enough about the amazing service she gave us. fingers crossed we get her next time we come in!"}
{"text":"Visiting some friends in Arizona and wanted some ramen. A friend recommended this place. We get there and sit down and it takes a minute for someone to bring menus and water (they were very busy). I look at the drink menu and notice a Bloody Mary that comes with a California roll. I personally LOVE bloody Mary's and for one to come with a sushi roll that's even better. When I finally got the drink (took awhile) the sushi roll was great. The drink, not so much. The cucumber flavor was VERY over powering. I told the waitress (which she was oh so kindly to take it off my bill) and ordered something else. I ordered the pumpkin latte beer....TERRIBLE. Didn't even taste like pumpkin. So there was strike two. I ordered ramen for dinner (build your own) and the flavor was pretty good. I got the spicy broth and every bite was different. It was weird. One bite would be super spicy and the next bite would be not spicy. I got pork in mine and it had a weird flavor to it, so I picked most of it out. The reason I'm even giving this place two stars is because our waitress was awesome. She did forget our other friends order (they had arrived after us) but she got that all take care of. I probably wouldn't come back to this place."}
{"text":"The staff of Shady Park is amazing. Elyssa and the manager were so sweet and the food was awesome. Totally will tell my friends about this place! 10/10 would recommend"}
{"text":"This review is only for the ramen. I keep looking for another place to have ramen as good as this, but I've never found it. I get the spicy broth and crispy pork belly. It's sooooo good!"}
{"text":"I had never had proper ramen before coming to Umami and it took a few trips to find the right bowl for me, but this place has become a quick favorite. I usually build my own with Spicy Tan Tan Men, Pork Belly, and Togarashi Corn. Sushi is a welcome addition to the menu, too! Service has always been friendly and helpful. Overall, its a nice place to chill with good food and conversation."}
{"text":"Another great hole in the wall. Great small venue for shows and really good ramen. I haven't tried anything else but the soups here, but they are delicious. Spicy Shoyu Pork is my goto. Rich, spicy broth, al dente noodles, and succulent shredded pork. They have lots of space and a great outback patio. 4 bigscreens inside showing sports and random whatever. And they usually have calendar of decent events happening here. They lose stars because of sometimes slow service. And also because I brought a date here on a Sunday and they were only serving sandwiches after talking the ramen up. So I guess call ahead and ask what food they have on Sundays? Otherwise,  its a great, fun place where I can get my ramen fix."}
{"text":"good place to come if you want to get kicked out by security for asking to talk to the manager. isn't that exceptional customer service?"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! The broth for the ramen is incredibly flavorful and the toppings, such as the fried chicken, are unique and a fun twist to the traditional dish. Servers are a bit scattered most of the times we've been there but the manager is helpful and attentive, which i appreciate."}
{"text":"The Vegan Ramen here is pretty good. So is the veggie sushi. Nice atmosphere and a very cool outdoor venue. Our waitress was a bit lazy."}
{"text":"What an interesting little restaurant this place is, right in the heart of Tempe off of University and Mill ave. Parking is a bit of a pain but worth it for an eclectic menu and friendly service. We went with a large group on a Friday afternoon and found seating on the patio. We ordered sweet sesame soy and regular bone-in wings to share, both flavors were very tasty. I ordered the paitan ramen bowl and added corn, hard egg, and the pork belly. If you order the fried chicken it comes out similar to a chicken strip so just a heads up. We had people in our group order pizza and salads, both which they liked. We also saw the chicken parm and meatball sandwiches ordered, they are very large and a bit hard to eat but were well received. Our server was friendly and attentive, the food did take a while to come out so just be prepared to take your time and relax. I felt the prices were reasonable (even better if you find cheap or free parking) and would be back based on this experience."}
{"text":"Cool little place, looks like a fun patio in the back but I've only visited on lunch breaks. They have some good drink specials like a penny pitcher with purchase of a large pizza. The spicy shoyu ramen is the bees knees. Three stars for less than average service on multiple visits and the sign in back saying yelpers not welcome. Despite the service and sign I'll probably be back for the ramen and drink specials."}
{"text":"Man this place has so much going for it but they need to get their staff in check. I had more bad experiences with bar staff, security in one night than I've had anywhere else on mill. At least 6 of my friends were kicked out, not for being belligerent, but because they looked \"intoxicated\". This place does not care for its paying customers and kicking out people that came to see a touring musician is disrespectful. Security was rude and condescending without giving reason for kicking anyone out even went as far as calling my friend an asshole for asking why he was being asks to leave."}
{"text":"Deliciousess - 2/5 Happiness 2/5  There are so many fun places to go in Tempe, I'm not sure why Shady Park would be on the agenda.   The service is so slow. Our food came out at different times - our son's pizza first, my caprese salad second, my wife's ramen third, and my wings last. And it wasn't even in close proximity, each person was halfway done with their meals by the time the next dish was served. The restaurant was not busy by any means, so the lack of ability to bring everything  out at once was definitely mystifying. And none of it came out quickly, which is problematic as you have to pay for parking at any nearby lot or street space. It took us over an hour to get through lunch at a non-rush time.  I was unimpressed with the pizza (my son didn't finish it) and the rest was OK. The ramen was overly salty with noodles that were just a bit too al dente (I know, fusing Italian terms with Japanese ramen is questionable too!). Further, they market a \"build your own\" ramen bowl, but it was so difficult to do. Apparently, you can't order the chicken noodle with a vegan broth (I can't eat pork-based broths for those wondering why I would want that) and it would be more expensive to build my own chicken noodle, so I just gave up and went with two appetizers - the wings (a nice sauce for sure) and caprese salad (completely uninspiring, and the tomatoes and cheese were both a bit dry).   The patio is big and really nice, and they appeared to have some awesome drink specials. But I just don't see the point of returning to try them out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, big patio, best ramen noodles with Umami partnership. Good menu options with food bar food,  ramen, good pizzas and beer options"}
{"text":"Mike D and Alex (hopefully Dani sees the names and remembers) came in looking for some food and drinks for a little birthday celebration. We sat at the bar and Dani was there to greet us. It was very surprising because she was super busy. She gave excellent service throughout the time being there and had a great personality, making us laugh the whole time. Thanks so much for the great birthday dinner Dani!!"}
{"text":"Always have a great time here. The drinks are super yummy and the food is delicious!! Loved the Catapillar roll I think it's my favorite.. just tried the wings they're so crispy and I ordered the honey hot.. definitely worth a try!!! They have reverse happy hour from nine to midnight which is awesome for some late-night munchies!! Definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I just got it delivered from Uber Eats and when they handed me the box it was so light it almost felt empty.  This was hands down the thinnest crust I have ever had.  It was actually difficult to pick up pieces because it was like paper under the sauce and cheese.  The flavor was actually pretty decent, but overall disappointing.  The vegan wings were good, but you only get 6 for $9.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"Really disappointed! Yesterday I ordered edamame and a side order of fried chicken which was three small perfect sized pieces and it was $4.50 today I ordered the same exact thing got the same exact amount of food and it was $7.50. I asked the bartender and he basically said oh well they changes that bc lots of people were ordering it but you get more. (Not only did I not get more, I didn't want more.)  Feeling swindled when 5 minutes prior to ordering I was bragging to all my coworkers about how amazing it is there."}
{"text":"I'm stuffed! Second time coming here. First time was date night (a nice peaceful dinner) and second time.... well..... we had the kids. Thank baby Jesus our waitress was awesome & the kids enjoyed this place. My son and I got the \"Miso Hungry\" & my dude can't remember his (obviously he wasn't paying attention) we left with our bowls empty! The House pickles are surprisingly super good!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the heart of tempe!  Amazing shows, great food, and daily drink specials!  The patio is beautiful especially at night with all the trees lit up. They have an amazing sound system and HUGE screen outside that they use for sports during the day and then amazing high quality visuals at night during their shows.  You should really check this place out day or night"}
{"text":"Great venue for great nighttime outdoor music.  I like the atmosphere, its a very chill place with a big patio.  I have yet to find the food which is next on my list."}
{"text":"Love love love the ramen at this place! They also have several other things but I recommend trying the ramen. Moreover the atmosphere is very calm and they are always playing great music."}
{"text":"So good! This place is awesome! I'm a vegetarian and my wife is vegan and there were tons of options for us to eat. The atmosphere is super cool and laid back with excellent service. Might come back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Have been here A LOT. When I first began coming here, they had a lot of other options and deals that they ending up getting rid of. They have shows here and provide a diverse environment both inside and outside (even open mic nights too). I had gone here a dozen times prior to trying their infamous ramen. Once I did, I was definitely impressed. My favorite ramen is the Miso Hungry (with the addition of roasted pork). Another thing to note is that they recently began carrying my favorite beer - Cali Creamin, so that's definitely a plus too. Also, another thing to note is that the yakitori is VERY small. As for the sushi, I've had good experiences and not-so-great experiences with it. Sometimes if you order the sushi after prime dinner-time, the rice will be slightly stale."}
{"text":"Awesome place right by ASU Tempe campus. I've come here for a few of their shows on the weekends in the back patio and have a had a great time. This time my girlfriend and I decided to just stop by for some food and the service and atmosphere is just what we needed"}
{"text":"My review is mainly for Umami- because it's simply my favorite and the best.   Don't get me wrong, the pizza looks delicious- but it's the Raman that we come back weekly for.  New to Ramen? It's not your $.50 grocery staple- you will fall in love with it- don't be afraid to mix it up.  I love adding in corn, butter and a soft egg to a Spicy Shenjo, but their are multiple offerings.   Ambience is a lot of fun at night- I have great nostalgia for my college days."}
{"text":"I walked in with several tables open but was unsure whether or not the seating was self seating so I sat down at a random table while awaiting the arrival of the rest of the group. I sat for about 15 minutes before being asked if I was being helped. Upon ordering my food, the hostess was very nice. I received my food, but didn't receive the same amount of noodles that everyone else did which was strange. It wasn't a big portion compared to the rest of the tables and it was a little awkward. The food, however, was great I just wish I was served the amount everyone else was (they didn't order extra noodles). Altogether, The flavor of the ramen was great, service was sub par, but my portion (compared to everyone else's) wasn't great. Might try other places for ramen before going back to this one."}
{"text":"Just tried the fettuccini Alfredo with grilled chicken for dinner, it was amazing!   Followed up a great open mic night in the back park area, solid spot!"}
{"text":"Never had any issues. The sound of the music is great and the staff is always friendly. Vinnie is my favorite bartender by far."}
{"text":"We have been regulars for over a month. Sometimes twice a day. The food is excellent. Tonight I was kicked out with my Service Animal (she has accompanied me several times) because she didn't have a vest. According to the federal law, Americans With Disabilities Act, \"When it is not obvious what service an animal provides, only limited inquiries are allowed. Staff may ask two questions: (1) is the dog a service animal required because of a disability, and (2) what work or task has the dog been trained to perform. Staff cannot ask about the person's disability, require medical documentation, require a special identification card or training documentation for the dog, or ask that the dog demonstrate its ability to perform the work or task.\"   You also made us sit outside in the cold \"People with disabilities who use service animals cannot be isolated from other patrons, treated less favorably than other patrons\"   Owners, please train your staff, this was very traumatic to be kicked out of a place we have spent thousands of dollars at, and a place that is \"dog friendly\". Please get up to speed and I will increase my stars, because the food really is remarkable. I don't want to be harassed again by someone who doesn't know the law."}
{"text":"Slow service, overpriced food.  I paid $9 for a \"1/2 pound\" of wings which ended up being 5 little chicken wings.  The ramen is too salty and even more expensive than the wings.   Avoid, there are plenty of better places on Mill."}
{"text":"Ramen is amazing, and the pizza is to die for. Shows most weekends of the month and open mic night on Tuesdays. What's not to love."}
{"text":"Nice indoor out door seating areas. My mom and I chose to sit outside and we came here for the Ramen. We started off with the Spicy California Roll, it was great and had a nice kick to it.   I tried the chicken noodle ramen. Flavor was on point, noodles were great and the chicken was good. Our server  Ashley was nice and knowledgeable, since it was our first time she helped us pick the best Ramen.   Would love to comeback here next time I'm back in Tempe, Arizona."}
{"text":"After tasting the crazy delish food at casa, I knew I had to try Shady Park. The space is nice, with a big bar and a nice patio. They weren't terribly busy on a Sunday afternoon, so my friend and I quickly received our pizza and beer. We were impressed by their menu, which featured pastas, pizzas, wings, sandwiches, and a myriad of other items. They make most items in house and have very interesting combos on their pizzas. We got the shady chicago, a red pizza with sausage, onion, peppers, ricotta, and... Walnuts. It was shockingly good. My one complaint is they only have 16 inch pizzas which are huge and kinda expensive at 20$ for a specialty pie... I wish they had more size options. I think during happy hour you can get a square of pizza and a cocktail for 3$ though, so that is fairly fabulous. Anyway, go check it out... It was good!  Ps their rules on their menu stated that yelpers weren't welcome, but hopefully they will make an exception for this one."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall place that is not only a fun and chill place to hang, it's where I get my Ramen fix. They have it all- Pizza, Ramen, live music and drinks. To the untrained eye, its location may be difficult to find given that its slightly tucked away from Mill ave. Don't let that deter you from trying the food, it's worth finding this gem.   Umami is the ramen joint within this establishment. When done right, it is by far my favorite bowl of ramen I've had to date in Arizona. The base bowl comes with an assortment of fixings that are good alone, but you have the option to add other toppings to the mix. Highly recommend. My go to is the Shio accompanied by Pork Belly, Togarashi Corn, garlic paste and a soft egg. Simply divine in a bowl.   Im conflicted with this place simply because the service is hit or miss. The people who worked there previously made the place memorable and in my recent visits, management and some servers have come off rude and irritable and requests that weren't unreasonable. I don't ask anyone to subject to my every request, but if there's an issue with food taking longer than it should, or whatever the matter, a prompt and kind response is appreciated, rather than a disgruntled, irritated one. I will continue coming here for the food, but they should seriously screen the people they put in charge."}
{"text":"I have tried this place a few times now. I live and work next to it. Every time I have had a poor experience. Today I went for lunch, when I went I was charged a little less than 25% more than I was supposed to on my tab. I ordered a beer off of the beer menu that says that all pints are $3.50. I got my bill and was charged $5.00 for it. When I asked the server she told me that the menu was old and all beers were $4.00 and my beer was a special beer.  Then I ordered a sandwich that was listed as $11.00 on the menu and my check was charged at $12.99.  When I asked the server said that it comes with a soda and was supposed to come with a salad as well. She brought out the food with out a salad and never asked me what soda I would like. This company has great potential but they have actually screwed me over multiple times and today was the last straw. I wanted this place to work out and be a nice place to enjoy a beer and a slice of pizza on my way home from work but as their name implies they are shady."}
