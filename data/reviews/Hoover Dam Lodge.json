{"text":"What a great hotel!  especially for the price! The staff was so friendly!!! Especially Edna:) We will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this hotel!  We booked one night here so we could hike up to the Hoover Dam.  We came to the right place!  The trailhead for the Old Railway Trail is right out the parking lot of this hotel. The sign for the trailhead is nice and big and there is a terrific map of all the trails you can do around the area.  There is a loop that spans 20 plus miles but we did the Old Railway and back which is approximately 9 miles.  The Old Railway trail is well maintained and there are 5 tunnels you get to walk through.  The old pictures are very interesting to see how they made the tunnels back in the day and the Pat Tillman bridge is a definite must see marvel of engineering as is the Hoover Dam itself!  Back to the hotel.  It has everything you need in one place.  A nice market where you can pick up snacks and a cold drink.  They even had fruit.  Apples, bananas, oranges, etc.  The cafe has very good food.  Our room was very spacious and I liked that there was a shower with no tub.  The bed was very comfortable and you have a refrigerator and microwave in the room which is convenient.  The prices for food and drinks are very fair at this hotel, they do not gouge unlike their sister city Las Vegas!  We will definitely stay at this hotel next time we visit Boulder City."}
{"text":"I specifically called ahead to confirm we could get a roll away bed. I confirmed that it would cost $10 a night and tried to reserve ahead of time. I wast told it would not be problem and could obtain upon check in. At check in  I was told it was a fire hazard even though I provided my check in reservation when I called. I even got a supervisor who pretty much told me to too bad. This is terrible customer service and very wrong which ruined our plans."}
{"text":"First, I have to say we did not spend the night there so can not comment about the rooms. We were camping 15 miles down the road at Willow Beach. But it had been very hot there and we decided to drive up and find a place to cool off for a couple hours and maybe have a meal. From the outside the place looked a little dated but we decided to check it out. The staff that we talked to were very friendly and helpful, even telling us about other camping and fishing areas to try. It had a couple dining options, we went to their cafe. My wife had a Cowboy Burger and I had a Chicken-fried steak dinner. Both meals were very good and reasonably priced. They only had bottled beer, nothing on tap. As we sat there enjoying our meal we assessed the place overall and it looked like it had been remodeled recently and was very nice, nothing was old or cheesy looking. They had a small casino, but the slot machines were mostly new ones and we played for a little while before driving back to our hot trailer. We would definitely recommend it for a stop."}
{"text":"We decided to stay here on our way back from Grand Cayon to go see the Hoover damn. It seems like a nice hotel from outside. When I get to the room it is hot went to front desk they said would send someone they arrive to check it and says it is because it is hot outside so until sun goes down it will cool this was at 8. Then we try to watch TV and the 8 channels are fuzy called to have someone look at it he comes in and says this is better than other rooms says nothing we can do. Then asked about ac again since it is 9:30 and no cooling has occurred says it is blowing cold air just needs to cool walls first. Will not come back if you are around go check the little hotels in Boulder if need to stay around prob cheeper and same quality can't go lower. Will not be returning!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Here's a summary of my experience, first and last, with my stay. Bottom line, the hotel room was fine, but service ranged from great to terrible. I booked a room for two nights through Expedia. When we first arrived to check in I was asked to pay for a deposit of $50 per night that would be refunded after my stay. I saw no problem with this and paid the deposit.  When I first arrived in the room I liked how big and spacious it was. It was easy to feel comfortable in the room. Everything was pretty much average for a hotel room which was fine because the rates were much cheaper than in Las Vegas. My girlfriend then tried to shut off the heater because it was load and the room was hot. The heater wouldn't shut off despite it the dial clearly pointing to the \"off\" position. We immediately grab our things and headed to the front desk to ask for a different room. The staff was quick to place us in another room and to look at the heater to see what was wrong. I was really impressed by the level of communication and urgency the staff had to accommodate us.  The rest of the stay was good. I liked the lobby as it had different displays with historical facts about the Hoover Dam and Boulder City. Checking out was nice and easy also. The big problem I had was that they charged me for staying one night at the lodge which shouldn't have happened because I already reserved through Expedia. I called customer service and explained the situation. I wasn't upset as I thought it was just a simple error or maybe it was a charge for something other than a room. I merely asked the representative if she could explain what the charge was for and she immediately grabbed the manager. The manager confirmed that I had \"opted\" to pay for one night which didn't make sense because I stayed for two nights. So that meant that they used my Expedia reservation, but for some reason charged me for an extra night. Still, the manager made little to no effort to help me and was quick to point the finger towards Expedia and instructed me to call them about my problem.  I called Expedia and the customer service rep was very kind and did an great job of communicating. They called Hoover Dam Lodge and talked to a manager who told them that they never charged me the extra night. So now I'm going to have to talk to my credit card agency to dispute this charge: it is frustrating.  It seems like common sense to not charge someone for a room that they already paid for, but I should've been more careful when paying for the deposit and looked to see that what their charging me was correct. I admit that it was a mistake on my part, but the reason for the negative review is that they seem reluctant to correct theirs. I gave it two stars instead of one because the service regarding everything else was great. I'm hoping to get the matter resolved soon."}
{"text":"Restrooms seem clean but they stink like rotten eggs soooo bad I could barely breathe. Terrible! Disgusting"}
{"text":"Stay clear of the Bourbon Street Casino inside this hotel.  Our food came out burnt and wasn't edible whatsoever.  We were refused any refund or even substitutions.  No apology either.   We paid cash money for absolutely nothing.  Unbelievable.  Asked quite of few employees around the hotel and there's nothing they can do.  I wouldn't stay here if they comped me."}
{"text":"Decent price, animals welcome (no extra fee mentioned but i haven't left yet so we will see. (Paid $79 dollars a night, unless they charged for our puppy) the hotel room was large with a nice bed, huge TV, excellent A/C, clean, good towels and soap, decent shower, microwave, fridge, iron, etc. This place has a pool and spa, the pool was nice to swim in, the spa was lower than the jets, luke warm, and just sort of lame.   The hotel is connected to a casino area, and a few individual restaurants that have their own casino games in them. It also has a general store and a bar. I could see this being a fun place for some drinking a gambling. We played a couple hours of slots, got some pretty bad food then called it a night. Went to their gym in the morning, amd as far as hotel gyms go this one was one od the best I've been to. Free weights amd cardio equipment, not amazing but can get the job done.   Easy parking, affordable, clean, friendly staff, fun games, bad food (at least one restaurant was)   I would stay here again if i were out here already and needed a place to crash."}
{"text":"Great location, had everything you need right on property. Rooms are clean and updated, they have a rustic theme. View from lake view room wasn't very impressive though and no balcony. Smells like smoke when you first walk in but once you get past that it's nice. Steakhouse was closed on Tuesday night(???) but front desk directed us to a good restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Stayed at this place figuring it would be a good stop to go check out Hoover Dam before heading into Vegas. It's a decent place. There is nothing around, though. The casino doesn't have any tables, only slots. Paid for an upgraded King room and the coffee maker had not been cleaned and had old filters in it. There was a basket of candy but you could tell the chocolate was bad. It was discolored. The service at the front desk wasn't great either. Food in the cafe was decent. The TV reception is awful!! Felt like it was the 80s and had a metal hanger for an antenna! All in all, I wouldn't stop here. Head straight on into Vegas."}
{"text":"The Bighorn Cafe is great! All meals! Everyone at this entire lodge are unbelievable . I have never met so many friendly workers. Very laid back and every is very helpful . Rooms are clean and affordable. The view of the mountains .... Awesome!!!!!! I would recommend the lodge and the Bighorn Cafe to everyone. The workers in the gift shop are so helpful and kind."}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer. This is the best kept secret.  Great rooms, great food, service always top shelf.  Go there,  tell them Kevin Sent you.  ;)"}
{"text":"I was camping at Lake Mead and I only stayed here one night to get out of the heat. I stayed in a pet friendly room. The rooms were dated but had a microwave and fridge. Maybe the other part of the hotel had nicer rooms. I would rate the staff higher because they were very nice and helpful.  The casino and restaurants didn't look exciting. The steakhouse menu looked expensive. We ventured into Boulder City to eat.  If you have a pet and need a quick place to stay this hotel would be ok, but I wouldn't make it a destination."}
{"text":"We ended up here after a night from He**.  It was after 11pm when we showed up so there were only a few people walking around.  All the workers were so incredibly nice to us.  Both of the guys who were at the front desk were incredibly nice and could see we were so exhausted with our two kids who were both tired and hungry.  The diner was closed but the small cafe was good for what it was, frozen burgers and fries.  Again the girl there was so nice and got me everything I asked for.  The room was basic but came with complimentary candy (which my 8 year old loved) and a mini fridge (which I loved).  The bathroom was nice with a pop in shower stall.  Clean and awesome water pressure.  A bit dark in the shower area though.  Everything was great till 1am and our upstairs neighbor decided to flood their room.  Again the guys at the front were super nice and moved us immediately even though I didn't want to since my kids had just fallen asleep.  We had a caddy for our bags which helped and our second room was just as clean and nice especially because there was no water coming through the ceiling and flooding my bathroom.  In the morning we checked out and they immediately refunded our entire room without even a question.    We ate at the diner in the morning and the food was good breakfast food.  The pancakes were HUGE and fed my husband, 8 year old and I even had a few bites too.  Our server was again so nice and helpful.  The bathrooms in the common area were updated nicely and extremely clean.  Everywhere was really clean and nice.    Suffice it to say I will stay here again if we go through here again because I know the people seem happy to be working there and actually want to help you have a happy stay."}
{"text":"Great 2 night visit! Stayed here because we were visiting the Hoover Dam. We enjoyed the location and ease of parking. Stayed on the 15th floor. Had a really nice room. Gave us water bottles and left a snack basket in our room. Would highly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again if in the area. All of the employees we came in contact with were super helpful. Definitely take the time to visit the trail behind the hotel to see Lake Mead!"}
{"text":"My sister and I stayed here for a Family Wedding. We reserved the Room months in advance. Upon arrival we were told that our room was not available so they assigned us a different room. Upon entering this room we found that the TV did not work and the Engineering Manager who came to fix it literally ripped it off the wall. This room was three floors lower than the one we reserved and paid a little more for. So he went and got us another room. This one still another floor lower. I should have mentioned that there is No Valet or Bus Boy services at this Hotel. So all these moves required my Sister and I to lug all our suitcases and garment bags ourselves. We also needed to get 11 room keys made in an attempt to access our room. Unsuccessfully I might add. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY AT THIS DISMAL HOTEL."}
{"text":"Was in need of a room after my truck broke down and was able to find accomodations here online for a very reasonable price. The room was clean, and spacious as well as warm and homey. Will stay here again."}
{"text":"I booked here for our last stop on our weekend trip because the nephew wanted to see the Hoover Dam and because I knew I'd be done with Vegas in one day.  How right I was.  Just a hop, skip and a jump from the dam we were relieved to be indoors as it was still 109 degrees outside when we were done with our lightning tour of the dam (that's a separate review)!  I was a bit disappointed that there was no parking in the shade - it being so hot and having been spoiled with undercover parking in Vegas.  We got there promptly at 3:00pm and tried to check in.  We were told that check-in wasn't until 4:00pm and that our room was not ready.  We had just booked a standard room so watching other people check in when we sat in reception was a bit irksome, but we walked around and looked at the facilities, bought some stuff in the shop and dead on 4:00pm we were in...  The room was huge - so much wasted space, but hey, it made a change from the tiny rooms you usually get.  There was a fridge, microwave, coffee maker and snacks in the room.  They also gave us copious amounts of water at reception.  The rooms were clean, the bathroom had the 70's separate dressing/sink area but the bathroom was big enough to dress in, which is important when you're sharing a room with a family member who you're not intimate with!  The steakhouse in the hotel was fabulous.  The decor is a little Goodfellas, but the food was superb.  We all had steak courtesy of my nephew's winnings and it was cooked perfectly and just melted in the mouth.  The wine we had was good also.  Service was super friendly."}
{"text":"Checked in after long backpacking trip and just wanted to take a shower... got in the shower in my room and turned around to find a visitor in the shower with me, a nice cockroach hanging out on the shower curtain. I quickly finished and called the front desk, they told me they were going to \"send someone.\" to do what I have no idea, so I asked for another room. They gave me a smaller room and when the maintenance guy showed up to give me the keys and check out my extra guest he tried to tell me it was a \"stain.\" Good thing I had already taken a picture to know the truth. Definitely the worst part about the experience was how the staff made me feel bad, like I had done something wrong. Since there was really no where else to stay in the area and it was super late, we just got the room on a higher floor and hoped we didn't bring any extra creatures home with us. I will be washing all my items that I brought into this hotel before I put them away in my house. If you can, I would find somewhere, ANYWHERE else to stay."}
{"text":"A great stop for a quick bite to eat or to pick up cheaper alcohol before you get into vegas. Its a great spot for places in arizona to gamble a little without driving the way into vegas  This has a couple places to eat but its nostly a quick bite like a hotdog or bar food. There is also a small shop to get supplies before you get to the dam or lake mead.  If you are going hiking in the area please stop and get water and snacks to replace electrolytes."}
{"text":"Great lodge! Affordable price for a weekend, 30 minutes from Vegas! Staff was very friendly, gave us bottles of water when we checked in at 2AM."}
{"text":"We did not have a great experience at your lodge. We got there at 2pm after a long 6 hour drive and our room was not ready until 4pm. My husband was exhausted and was not able to rest. We finally got in and we went in to town for dinner and look around. When we got back in our room, the toilet was not flushing properly. The maintenance man was there for about an hour and a half and was unable to fix the problem. He said there was a cell phones in the toilet and was unable to fix the problem. He said there were no rooms available so we stayed the night with a restroom that was not working properly. The next morning I went down stairs to ask the front desk if we could have another room. She said she  would call us when one was available. We went out and about all day and I didn't enjoy my day because I was waiting for that phone call. I never got a call. I went to the front desk at about 6pm or 7pm to ask if we if we could have another room snd we finally got another room. They gave us a smaller room. I was not happy with that. I wax expecting a similar room or better. We finally got settled in and went down stairs for a snack. But the lady at Dollies was rude. We placed our order and her response was \" you need to wait 30 minutes for me to heat up your food in the microwave... do you really want that?\" Simply rude. We went next door to try the pickled chips and she said she didn't have ranch. So we gave up. We went upstairs to get ready to shower and our shower was not draining. So we called for the maintenance man again. He was in our room  for about an hour and he finally fixed the problem. We went to sleep late because we are a family of 4 and it took a long time for use to shower after he took a long time to fix the shower. All in all we did not have a good experience. My kids will not have good memories about the lodge and I didn't get to enjoy my family because I was worried about what else could go wrong. I will never go to your hotel again."}
{"text":"Staying the night on the way to Phoenix.    I am grateful I found a room since LV and Henderson were booked up.   However i would not stay here again.  Grant it it is a Friday night, but it is very smoky in the casino and the rooms are not worth the price charged.     I am traveling alone and so far I feel safe.   I did not eat at the two restaurants they have nor did I gamble or drink do cannot comment on those. Employees were great, except a man that answered the phone at the front desk.  No matter how busy you are, it is your job to be pleasant. The door to my room would not latch so I couldn't lock it.   Front desk called Maintenance and they had to fix and grind some parts and they got it fixed!!  TV channels do not come through clear.  WiFi seems to work well."}
{"text":"The people that work in the general store: RUDE!!!! we are visiting from CA. We ordered a basket of fries thinking that it would come with everything written under it. When our order came with plain fries we asked what happened to the condimemts etc. she said we had to ask for it. Nowhere on the menu did it say that. I also ordered a corn dog and after waiting 10 min it came out still frozen. When I went to tell them that they told me to order something else! I asked for my money back! I didnt mind that the food wasnt cooked all the way. It was their lack of customer service that agitated me. They were rude everystep of the way. Never again!"}
{"text":"We arrived very late on a Friday night (early sat morning) after coming from the east coast with several plane delays. We chose to stay here due to the proximity to the Hoover dam trail head. Checked in by a very kind gentleman who ended up giving us an upgrade to the 15th floor after I mentioned a room with a view would be cool. Top 4 floors have been all re done and are very nice. We could see lake mead from our room and the sunrises were especially beautiful. The whole staff in all areas of the facility were very nice. Hotel is very clean and comfortable and ground floor where bar/casino/store/restaurants are located is very modern and tastefully decorated. Great place to stay off the strip! Only about a half hour to Vegas. If you want to be away from the craziness of the strip I recommend you stay here! If you do the 7 mile round trip hike to the dam, be sure to wear comfortable closed toe shoes, bring lots of water and don't do it if the weather expects to be much over 80 degrees, otherwise it's pretty scorching!"}
{"text":"Great place to do a quick stop when traveling to Utah, Arizona, Nevada area. I have gluten sensitivity and was able to order their Mahi Mahi tacos for dinner without any issues. The hotel itself has a pool and arcade for the kids. Free snacks and bottled water when you check in. It's not a 5 star hotel but it's a best valued price hotel located near the Hoover dam."}
{"text":"We stopped in for breakfast. Beautiful place. Lori, our waitress, was wonderful. Service was great. The food is not fresh. Chicken Fried Steak is a frozen patty and the hash browns may also be frozen. The bacon, although tasty, was very greasy."}
{"text":"The bartenders are really friendly and the people are nice front desk little bit more work overall we all had a good time I love going there the in the rooms work clean can't wait till next year the casino is different but nice"}
{"text":"Great Casino, rooms are nice! New matress, coffee, mini fridge, microwave, hair dryer, coffee maker, they even leave you candy! :)  We had a nice view partial of the Lake and straight view of the helicopters for the Grand Canyon tours. My 8 year old enjoyed that."}
{"text":"Refreshing hospitality. Impeccably remodeled, surprisingly quiet and self contained haven. Love this place! From the warm welcome at the front desk to the lovely views from every angle, to the great service at the cafe and in the gift shop to the spacious well designed airy casino to the amazing trails and explorations to be had nearby...this is a true oasis of quality and comfort in the high desert. The free parking and 24 hour security with a smile sent this review over the top!  Just minutes from Boulder City proper and @30 minutes from Vegas it will be my choice for future trips to the area. Thanks to entire staff for making our 6 night stay one to remember"}
{"text":"Stayed here with a few friends as we were in the area for outdoor adventures. I love how accessible it is from the highway and distant it is from the noise, lights, and crowds of Vegas. For the price, there is not much I could complain about. Our room with two queen beds was spacious and clean. The mattresses were soft, and the bathroom looked immaculate. The receptionists at check-in were friendly in answering my questions regarding local spots. My only complaint is that when my friends and I tried to eat at the Steakhouse for dinner on a Saturday night, there was no host to be found. We waited behind two other parties who had been waiting for someone to show up for several minutes already. A restaurant employee finally did show, but she was preoccupied with other tasks. Eventually everyone in line dispersed, and we decided to walk to the Bighorn Cafe where Steven, our waiter, delivered excellent, attentive, and warm service. He worked hard to ensure that we were satisfied with our meal. Thanks, Steven!"}
{"text":"This worked well for us because we needed a place last minute, good ac, good beds.  It's a bit smokey so if cigarettes bother you this might be a problem.  There's a casino downstairs and our room was in the third floor above a loading dock where the staff may have been smoking.  You could probably request higher up if this is to be a problem.  The room itself was not smokey.  The beds were absolutely wonderful.  Couldn't have asked for more; queens with a mattress top that made them just a wonderful place to sleep.  The room was large.  There was a fridge but without internal freezer.  No breakfast with room.  Sink was clogged but they sent an \"engineer\" within a half hour.  Good sheets and towels; it was all fine.  Again, if the cigarette sample of casinos is ok."}
{"text":"Although this hotel has a casino it is really run down. I honestly felt like I was staying in an icky motel. the carpet was coming up in the hallways. the wallpaper was peeling, the shower pressure sucks, the bathroom sink and mirror leaves no room to do anything (super tiny), and tv is fuzzy when you turn it on. And the worst part about our stay was Stacy at the front desk. she checked us in and was so freaking rude! I used to work as a front desk manager at a hotel and I would have fired her immediately had I seen how she interacted with guests. My family came down for a family reunion and we all checked  in at different times and when we all met up the first thing we even said to each other was how rude Stacy at front desk was. And don't even try to check in before 4pm, not even if its 3:55pm because according to Stacy that whole 5 minutes make a huge difference when in reality it takes her 10 minutes to check you in. Not to mention she mixed up mine and my dads room and didn't even apologize. we booked these rooms months ago and wanted to have our rooms next to each other and even after she mixed up our room she told me I had to wait until later that night until all the guests checked in to see is she could move me. I will NEVER stay at this hotel ever again. I am just happy I was not planning on spending a lot of my time in the hotel otherwise I would have been really pissed and threw a fit."}
{"text":"I always wanted to stay here and i finally did- My October 2017 stay here was pretty awesome and i'll fill you in without further interruption  CHECK IN: The person behind the desk had someone watching over her shoulder so i assume she was new. It took 2 minutes longer than usual to get my keys and be on my way but it wasn't that bad. All my questions were answered to my satisfaction.  ROOMS: I really recommend the Deluxe room (not the standard) It was clean, recently updated, had a large refrigerator and had a microwave (yep you read correctly) They included a complimentary snack basket in your room which i've never seen at any other hotel (Nice touch!) The shower was very large & modern and the bed was very comfortable. I think about any room you get in this hotel will offer a spectacular view.  Note- When you book you have the option of renting a mountain bike for the trails behind the hotel.....i totally recommend it. They are Mongoose bikes in pretty good shape.  POOL: Pool is open until 11pm, the hot tub was needed after a long day of biking.  DINING: The Bighorn Cafe had one of the best burgers I have had in awhile (No BS).  The decor is cozy (like a lodge) and they broke up the Casino into several different themed rooms like New Orleans theme and a Mexican theme with the corresponding type of food and drinks at each.  GIFT SHOP: The store was large and offered everything at reasonable prices (for a change).  I was incredibly happy to be here and can't wait to go back and look at the view."}
{"text":"For a quick trip to Boulder (for zip lining) we stayed at Hoover Dam Lodge. There were 2 adults and a teenager. Not horrible, but definitely showing age in the rooms/bathrooms. The room was clean and smoke free (un-like everywhere else, restaurant included). The 2 full size beds had clean, bug free sheets. They were a little stiff but again not horrible. However, they had the crinkly plastic waterproof covers in the mattress with a flat (not fitted) sheet over it. It was noisy and when moving at night, we found the flat sheet not staying in place so we ended up in the plastic. They offer complimentary snack size chocolates and crackers in room. Towels were thick but a bit scratchy like they'd been washed in straight up lake water. Pool was closed (only available in summer months). Gift shop/Store had everything you could need. Restaurant was awful, but that's another review.   All in all not bad for under $100 a night for a quick trip. However I'd look at other options next trip."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend staying here. I took my daughter and 2 grand kids for a 2 day stay and was very pleased with room and was treated very pleasantly by ALL staff members. I did my normal gambling and even though the casino seemed \"small\" it had enough machines to keep me entertained. We had several meals which was reasonably priced and was delicious. We had a nice view and the room was clean, beds were comfortable. The kids loved the shower! We took them to wet and wild which was only 30 mins away. We had a blast. If their happy, I'm happy. Over all, had a wonderful couple days."}
{"text":"Worst hotel stay ever. Toilet would not flush at times (had to lift lid and manually flush...eww!) TV was static  coffee maker was for disposable cups but normal coffee packets were supplied so not functional. Carpet was heavily stained and felt crunchy under feet. Shower was a trickle. Called down several times and nothing done. Was out and about most of the two days we were there and when returned nothing had been done to fix issues. Basically rented a bed! When I checked out and told them issues again response was a blank look. I said that I wasn't asking for a refund just wanted to let them know issues before they booked someone else in it. They said ok. No apologies or customer service efforts. Front desk was rude and short when I called during stay. The casino and main floor was nice but the room was ridiculous. Beware!"}
{"text":"Be very careful about staying here.  The hotel is not careful with your credit card information.  I have just learned that the hotel payment system was hacked and my credit card info is available to the hackers.    I am so angry and not least because of the hack.  The notification from the hotel came under the name of Nevada Hotel Services, a company I didn't realize I was dealing with.  Why not tell me the name of the hotel (because I stayed in a couple of them in Nevada on this trip).    I am also angry because this company is providing nothing!  The company's letter advised me to be vigilant in checking my credit card statements, to file a complaint with the FTC and to freeze my credit.   Is the hotel doing anything at all for me and others who were victimized?  No.  Nothing.    I would never stay here again and I advise you to avoid it, too."}
{"text":"Great, quaint resort! The themed casino rooms are a unique touch and the adult games on \"bourbon street\" were a blast!!! Live music was top notch and customer service/attention was way better than expected. Oh and retro candy in their snack store was a fun find :) Also, history facts and photos around the casino floor were neat to go through. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I think it is too expensive for what it provides for us. Carpet was so dirty and some furniture pieces were missing. Above all, mattress was sinking and the sheet didnt feel clean. I wish we had had more options around the area."}
{"text":"Nice clean rooms. They left us little snacks everyday! The cafe was really good too. Everyone is so friendly there. Christine in the gift shop, the bus lady who speaks German in the cafe, the night bartender/cashier, that poor girl does everything with a smile on her face!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by this Hotel. It is a basic design for any hotel that was clean and welcoming when I arrived. It was kinda of plain compared to some of hotel off the Strip, but I was still happy nonetheless. I have driven by this hotel going to the Dam, and had always made plans to stay here during the summer. I am glad I made the decision for my business trip in Boulder City. I will be back for many more visits!"}
{"text":"This place has changed. We have been staying here since it was the gold strike and most everything that has come after that hotel has been good when it comes to our family trips. This time around we right off the bat heard of a boat and truck being stolen from the property our first night. That next morning the staff wasn't sure what had happened and didn't have any plans for securing the lot further to prevent this from happening again and was downplaying the event. Worrying about our truck and boat getting stolen and lack of hotel support created some tension. The room keys were constantly being demagnetized and on 4 different occasions we had to go down and get room keys just so we can get back in our room. The lady at the front desk said they are old room keys and demagnetize easy. The price has significantly increased yet nothing really has changed the rooms still look the same and the service is worse. The hotel operations manager was gonna check on discounting our rooms or doing something to offset some of these issues, and she didn't ! We also called the dottis phone # to speak with someone about this issue. The dottis phone # went straight to a voicemail and we haven't received a phone call back. This hotel won't disclose if there's been a high rate of theft and won't do anything about it, and they won't take care of there customers they would rather avoid it. I don't know if we will stay here again, it's been 27 years."}
{"text":"Brought the family to see Hoover Dam, and decided to stay a night at Hoover Dam Lodge, what a great decision it turned out to be, the front receptionist Kaylee was extremely polite , answered all my questions and gave me the correct directions on how to get to dam and told me not to follow rhe GPS directions, I would end up in a dead end or in the lake iteself. The room was very clean, even had a lil snack basket with goodies (bite sized candys) which my kids devoured, we had a great view of Lake Mead from our window, but what impressed me the most was the room did NOT smell like cigarette, aside from the temperature being hot as hell ( it was so hot it made James Brown) my family and I had a great stay at Hoover Dam Lodge, my kids enjoyed the pool and the grub at Big Horn Cafe was excellent"}
{"text":"The closest place to get a decent meal near the Hoover Dam. We did not stay there, just had lunch.  Its actually a hotel/casino/gift shop with a small but decent cafeteria. Dont expect great stuff from the food. Its practical, simple and the food is average. Not bad, just ok.    Just near this is a trial that goes along an old railroadd track, which is fun (weather permitting).."}
{"text":"Decided to make a emergency rest stop because I knew I couldn't make the drive to The Grand Canyon.   What can I say? The room was only $99 and had a great view! Plenty of towels, wash cloth & hand towels. Mini fridge, microwave, coffee machine & coffee. Also stocked with body soap/face soap, shampoo/conditioner, lotion & mini sewing kit! Free snacks on the side desk & HUGE King beds! I was really amazed by how nice this hotel was."}
{"text":"I was told there is internet. There was not. They claim there is, but its weak to non existent. Pulled this out of a desk girl (I don't really know why, mostly no internet.) I dislike being lied to here. Ice machines ever other floor, had to do a hunt for. The hot water bleeds into the cold water, as a plumber I know the fix, so cold water always warm. Positive side , the back restaurant is always good, I had same waiter as last year. Been here 3 times, From now on ,well no more. I really needed internet."}
{"text":"Comfortable accommodations. Clean, friendly service. Good stopover for tourists with plenty to do in the area. If you're staying on business in the area...forget it. Hotel's free ,WiFi bandwidth is limited, and somewhat slow, and cell service inside the hotel is not existent (AT&T). I had to go out to the middle of the parking lot to get a cell signal for phone calls."}
{"text":"Very comfortable and welcoming. Easy access to the dam and hiking. Breakfast at the cafe in hotel was delicious and they accommodated our dietary needs with a smile."}
{"text":"This review is for the cafe and casino only.  First the employees were extremely friendly throughout the entire property. We really liked the sports bar area. It had lots of TVs, some gaming and also arcades but know it's still part of the casino so no kids are allowed to play the arcades in this area( but I think they have another arcade section for kids but not 100% sure!). Though the place is quite small (compared to a Vegas casino) they had a small main floor casino and 3 other little gaming areas including the sports bar area,  La Villita area and a Dottys section (both also had 24 hour food). The place was immaculate with pictures and history about the local area all around the property.  We were in the casino around 11am on a Friday and there was only a few people around (could be why everything was so clean!) but lots of cars in the parking lot so they were out at Hoover Dam, Lake Mead or a tour which I noticed  you can get info about things to do in the area on their website.  We just had eggs at the cafe but it was good. Staff was very nice but seemed to be confused at times but who cares we got our food and our drinks refilled in a timely manner. Loved the informative flip cards about the area on the tables and loved all the pictures of the local animals and of the local area on the walls in the cafe too.  Hoover Dam Lodge felt laid back comfortable place to hang out and see and do the activities in the area. Different and refreshing. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Don't ever stop here to eat, the service is terrible.  We can't review the food. It hasn't arrived."}
{"text":"The rooms are newly renovated and clean. The decor has large wooden pieces I would so love to have in my house. The staff is friendly and helpful. Would come and stay again."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay. We were warmly greeted by the front desk staff upon arrival. Our check-in was quick and uncomplicated. Our room was very clean and spacious. We had dinner in the cafe. The menu had a variety of all different selections. The prices were ridiculously reasonable. Our food was served hot and the portions were huge. In the morning we walked the trail to Lake Mead. Very beautiful at sunrise. We highly recommend the Hoover Dam Lodge."}
{"text":"its was fist visit there with my whole family we reserved 2 separate rooms.  we checked in late but upon check in they had our rooms already set up super close without having to ask them.  bed was super comfortable and pillows too.  front desk where super nice as well. my mom liked it she was happy with our stay.   my kids and nephew enjoyed it let them roam around and play in the arcade.  and like 10 min from hoover dam which we went in the morning. i would return back and recommend it to other family members price was decent."}
{"text":"I stayed here because almost all the hotels in las vegas were either full or out of my budget since i went there during the time of new year regular hotels that would charge me 45$ per night would charge 250$ so I decided to find cheap hotel since i was not going to sleep in vegas ! This hotel is close to hoover dam. Standard room not that much clean and has small casino and other stores. The location is quite far away from las vegas so if you are planning to stay far away then you can give this place a go for low price."}
{"text":"We stayed overnight due to the location being close to our planned hike the next morning. We arrived about 530 and had no issues checking in. The whole casino and restaurant floors were very clean and everything appeared to recently be remodeled. They have a large sports themed bar with various games that you get tokens for every time you order a beer (think Dave and Busters). There was a extended bar and they had a good variety of craft beers for both on tap and in the bottle to select from that was nice. There were plenty of couches and flat screen TVs and coffee tables open so we watched some football and basketball games that we were able to bet on the games by using the William Hill Kiosk located in the in the back. We had breakfast at The Big Horn Cafe which opened at 7am. The breakfast is very affordable and has all basic staples. There are also 2 other 24 hour restaurants in the casino that we did not eat at as well as a Steakhouse that opens at night. All casino table games are computer dealers with no roulette. The room was clean and adequate with a basket of various small candy and peanuts left for us which was a nice touch. The was also a microwave and mini fridge included.  There was a nice view of the mountains and Lake Meade on the side which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"This place is a little different from other casino hotels. It's more relaxed with little lounge spots placed all around and no dinging sounds from a bunch of slots. The cafe food was like cafeteria food, not great but not bad. Our room was a suite and came with some water and snacks, a nice touch. The only real complaint I have is the tv is full of lines and snow and the tech said they can't fix it at this time and the air conditioner sounds like a Mack truck, but If you're going to the lake this place is very convenient and not a bad choice"}
{"text":"The casino allows smoking which, unfortunately, floats throughout the lobby and over to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Arrived at the Lodge after a Wednesday trip to Hoover Dam.  The steakhouse is closed Tues/wed and an accident on the highway stranded us at the Lodge Cafe.  Waited 30 min for a table, then once seated waited 20 min with no water, no acknowledgement from waiters, asked hostess what was going on, still no water... waited 10 more minutes (again we are stranded) when waitress finally came to our table informed us they did not have main 3 items (meatloaf, chicken or salmon) that they had changed menu several months ago and not updated....  Left and went to the General store for microwave burritos.  General Store staff was wonderful...and the Lodge does back up on Lake Mead National Park.  If you stay here be sure to check out the hiking trails from the Lodge parking lot."}
{"text":"This is a great little hotel/casino just past the Hoover Dam right before you get into Boulder City. They have recently renovated the entire property from its previous days under another name.   I stopped here for breakfast last year and again the other day before driving home to Phoenix. I prefer to drive out of Vegas a bit before I stop and found this to be the perfect spot!  Nice little restaurant with everything from breakfast to steaks. Everyone in our party ordered breakfast and we all enjoyed it. I had an omelet which was done perfectly. Chicken fried steak was another hit in our party. Hash browns were amazing, seasoned well and the potatoes were a thicker cut than average which was a nice touch.   Service was a little slow but not terrible. I just think our server had too many tables.   Driving to or from Las Vegas? Be sure to stop by the Hoover Dam Lodge for a great meal!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a hotel off the Strip. We tried this hotel. It is clean, quaint, and quiet. We were pleasantly pleased with the rooms. Spacious and clean. Did I mention clean?! The price of the rooms were awesome and the steakhouse onsite served an amazing meal and didn't rob our checkbook. We would highly recommend staying at this property!"}
{"text":"My family and I recently fell on hard times. This hotel offers an employee discount for its employees to stay in the hotel. My daughter and brother both work for this company so we used the employee discount in order to stay here a few weeks while looking for a more permanent solution to our issues. At the time we checked in there was a great manager named Jamie who absolutely helped us out. She has since left the company and I now see why. After she left the place went to shit! We were no longer treated like valued guest. We ate in every restaurant they had paid for our rooms up front and were not a problem to anyone. Yet my lady was locked inside the pool area, my daughter (an employee) was harassed by 1 particular security guard every day. We were gossiped about because I'm a member of a motorcycle club and wanted to park my bike in a lighted area in front of the building. Mind you we've spent almost 2000.00 in this hotel between rooms, gambling, and food. This place has the worst guest service I have ever seen. DO NOT STAY HERE. Oh and they have scorpions in the hallways, bees in the hot tub, bugs in the light fixtures."}
{"text":"Great place BUT no internet. If you don't have Verizon your out of luck. You have to go outside to connect to your regular service. Unreal."}
{"text":"I can't fathom why this place gets such good reviews. The hotel lobby is smoke-filled as it's connected to the casino. It's odd because all the rooms are smoke-free. It's an unpleasant welcome, especially if you have kids in tow. The room is spacious, comes with a mini fridge and they welcome you with free snacks. However, the bed pillows are uniform and hard. So if you like to gamble and smoke, this may be a good option. If not, go elsewhere in Boulder City."}
{"text":"Just a short trip from the Hoover Dam you will find this hotel. The outside is nice. Upon arrival our family wasn't aware there was a casino attached. We arrived at 2pm to check in after we toured the Hoover Dam, come to find out check in is at 4pm. My husband went in to get our room key and was told that kids are not allowed anywhere near the casino area and had to come in through the lobby and straight up to the room. Okay no problem, I went in with the kids and the place smelled like smoke entering the lobby again no problem, but I don't like the smell of cig. Smoke at all! Our room was on the 5th floor so we headed to the elevator and ascended to the 5th floor. Elevator doors open and the heat in the hallway hits you like a furnace ...they really need to do something about that. We enter the room and was suprised it was so large. 2 king size beds, small couch huge bathroom with dressing area. The ac was not on in the room so it was really hot...it did take a while for the room to cool off because the curtains were slightly open with the Arizona sun shining brightly in. Giving this hotel a 3 star review because of the smoke, lack of kid/teen choices, and the heat issue. Beds are comfy and if you want to gamble there are many opportunities to do just that."}
{"text":"Just had brunch in cafe. Very solid ham/egg dish. Ham actually hickory smoked and sourdough actually sour. Good portion of hash browns as well. Stylish restaurant."}
{"text":"The pillows in our deluxe room were so fat they weren't suitable for normal human beings.  Glad I take my own pillow on our trips.  My wife stuffed a towel into one of their pillow cases so she could sleep better. Also, their inexperienced clerk at the front desk told me that my card was declined, even though that charge was accepted by my bank."}
{"text":"I have never stayed here or gambled here. This is usually a pit stop whenever we drive to Lake Mead or take a road trip.   Inside there are a couple of restaurants, a bar, Dotty's, Bourbon Street and a general store. Items at the general store are reasonably priced. They have your typical convenience & gift store offerings along with a snack bar serving baked goods, fudge, drinks, sandwiches, etc...   You can learn about the Hoover Dam or see what kind of creatures are in the area at their designated displays.  There are also other informative displays throughout the hotel.   They have lots of parking. The hotel looks nice & clean. Restrooms are clean. Staff that we've encountered have been nice & friendly. Overall a great place to check out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! We stayed for two nights. We had a great view including a partial view of lake mead.   The hotel is a close driving distance to the hoover dam itself. Its also very close to the lake mead visitor center and national park entrance   The room was clean and comfy. We went during the summer so it was very hot outside, but our AC in our room was working great!   The mini mart they had at the first floor also had \"regular prices\"-- not overpriced as you would see in other hotels. It was also open 24 hours  They also offer bike rentals, etc that we did not take advantage of  I forgot to add that they had a good fitness center and laundry area"}
{"text":"Disappointing hotel. Rude restaurant/food workers, they were out of everything we wanted to order to eat at 3 of the 5 eatery options, extremely disappointing. Room was so-so. Walls are thin, heard everything upstairs AND next door! Plumbing was awful! Loud toilet that ran for 10 min after every flush and the shower barely drained. Room was spacious but lacked a big enough table to eat in your room especially since there was really no where to eat except in the sad restaurant they have."}
{"text":"Stacy at the front desk who also takes reservations is Awesome!  She is so pleasant and warm having a great personality.  Ask for her and you will be made to feel welcome and taken care of!"}
{"text":"Made reservations and arrangements to have a pull away bed for my 5 year old. This was no issue over the phone and a 10 dollar charge would be assessed. Fair enough. Checked in and they indicated the bed will be up shortly. Hours later we were told this wasn't possible and sorry. Oh not to mention that this newly remodeled rooms shower wouldn't drain. Spent quality time with the maintenance crew for an hour while they fixed it. If I had of known about the bed and shower situation I would have stayed elsewhere."}
{"text":"Basically after a long backpacking trip we crashed at the Lodge to shower and get some good sleep on a real bed. We ended up finding a nasty cockroach inside the shower curtain (it had two layers). While showering my friend saw this little guy staring back at her moving his little legs and antennas. SUPER GROSS. Anyways we call front desk and they said they would send someone up?? How does that even solve the problem? Are they going to just kill it for us? We didn't want to take roaches home from this room. We asked to switch so the front desk sent some maintenance guy and some chick to look fr the cockroach. He then proceeds to tell us its a cockroach stain and not to worry. Uh last time I checked a stain doesn't have antennas and legs that move around. Uhh do we look retarded?  My friend literally watched it move around while she was showering. This was just crappy because we checked in late and just wanted to shower and rest. We ended up moving to another room but were weary of critters getting in our luggage. Did I mention we were on the 4th floor?"}
{"text":"This place is great!!! -close to the Hoover Dam -nice room -complementary snacks -cool gift shop -good restaurants A GREAT VALUE!!! (but we were really bummed out that pool and Jacuzzi were closed for the season)"}
{"text":"Needs remodeling badly. Rooms are Very outdated. Everything dates back to the 80s. Not satisfied. We would have gone on into Vegas if we'd known it was like it is."}
{"text":"I checked in at 2am due to serious delays on my flight. Bree checked me in. She was so sweet and let me know what all was available now and in the morning.   The room was amazingly clean, loved the snacks that they provided free of charge, and I may have swiped the shampoo and conditioner. Lol I left a tip for the housekeeper.   Even though my room was facing a busy street, it was very quiet! Also, a fridge and microwave was provided in the room. If I had stayed in Vegas proper, the room would have run closer to $250!   I recommend this hotel/casino to anyone!"}
{"text":"This is probably the nicest place to stay in Boulder City. It's old and the rooms could use updating, but it is clean, well maintained and the closest room you can rent to Hoover Dam. I didn't set out to see the dam but was passing by on the way out of Las Vegas and ended up staying long enough that I needed a room for the night. .  The staff is friendly, helpful and have the small town charm that I am somewhat surprised to see so close to Las Vegas.  The casino is broken down into several smaller rooms. I assume they are operated by the same owner, but they appear to be separate businesses, each with their own theme, dining options, music, and decor. All games are video based except for one classic slot machine. No dealers. There are also arcade games and a pinball machine for the kids.  There are historical photos and displays of Hoover dam  and a short documentary of it's construction. You can also see the video on the hotel channel in your room. The food in the restaurant is basic, but good and priced right.  My room had a view of lake Mead and of the Helicopter tour company located at the opposite end of the parking lot. Like I mentioned, the room could use updating, maroon carpet, floral wallpaper header, linoleum bathroom floor, out of date furniture etc, but it was clean and nothing was broken. The TV and refrigerator we're newer. The TV looked like a 50 inch LCD. Not too many channels though, basic cable, and the input signal was definitely not HD. In my experience, hotel refrigerators never get cold enough, so I adjusted to max cold. By morning all my water froze to ice. +1 for the fridge! You can also expect complimentary snacks and water in your room. The bed was co.fortable but that is personal preference.   The fitness center was nicer than most hotels. Everything was modern and in good repair. Two treadmills, two ellipticals, rubberized dumbbells from 5 to 75 lbs, one flat and two adjustable benches, a V shaped weight stack machine with all the attachments so you can get your cable crossovers on, and newer yoga mats...Incase you don't like GAINS! J/K.  It's not LA Fitness, it's a hotel. If you can't get a pump here, you don't really want to work out. The pool is seasonal and was closed during my stay.  I can tolerate an out of date room for cleanliness and security, but I thought the price was a bit much. I paid half as much for a room at Treasure Island in Las Vegas the night before and that's only about 30 minutes away. Still, I like the place and I might stay here again if I return."}
{"text":"Stayed here on 9/18/15 and I must say it was a very pleasant surprise, especially for paying under $100! After a very long day in Vegas we arrived to the lodge around 2 am & were greeted by a very pleasant receptionist who made checking in a breeze and even threw in free water bottles! There is a 24 hr guest store as well as a yummy diner. The room is a little outdated but was very clean and comfortable. Definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting lake mead/ hoover dam!"}
{"text":"Nice clean room and great service. Close to lake Mead and the Hoover dam. Has everything we need! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Nice little casino in Boulder City on the way to Hoover Dam.  My in-laws mentioned having a lot of fun here so my husband and I came to check it out.  They have a couple themed bars inside the casino.  One is New Orleans themed and the other is Mexico themed. Bourbon Street was fun because they had ticket arcade games in the bar.  Prizes you could win ranged anywhere from 50-1000 tickets.  Small but fun selection of prizes.  Some NFL/NBA memorabilia, NFL /NBA Mardi Gras beads, feather boa, masks.  A little pricey for the arcade games since some games cost up to $1.50 for one round of electronic beer pong.  Still Had a really good time though.  Friendly bar/casino staff.   Worth checking out."}
{"text":"Nice place they have def remodeled and it's nice and clean. We don't gamble so we don't judge by that but we like to look at the history of the town and they have plenty of plaques and info on the dam so that was cool to see."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day lunch and we had to wait over 30 minutes for a table and there were 6 or more booths available but no one to serve you.  We finally got a booth and the server was a cranky old lady who was very rude. We ordered burger's and told them we wanted med- well, they came 39 minutes later and were raw and cold in the middle. Beware..... this place sucks!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero i would!!! Gambled.....not one beverage offered! Smelly and not clean Payouts are horrendous is a generous statement...it's like paying to watch TV Do NOT waste your time stopping"}
{"text":"Thanks Hoover Dam Casino. You cost me a dinner out with my husband. No draft beer in the place and now he won't eat dinner!. You've got to  be  kidding. We didn't gamble and I had 1 glass of wine. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with husband. Nice and clean. Service was good. His food was amazing. My mashed potatoes were the best part of my meal."}
{"text":"Lovely hotel! Found it by using booking.com - got a room for 109. Asked for high floor and was happily surprised to get the 17th floor ( top) floor king delux room! The view was awesome! Thefurniture and bed were top notch. Large walk-in shower was fab! ONLY complaint is the pillows were all super thick and both hubby and i get neckaches from super thick pillows. If they would add a couple of more squishy ones! The room had a nice big micro and mini fridge. Really was a great place! Customer service, very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Don't let the newly finished remodeled outside fool you. Bathroom dirty tissue box left empty had to kill two spiders the only thing in the room that looks even close to being remodeled/updated is the flat screen tv the a.c. won't get cold had to plug in lamps. They do have 5 places to sit and get food although if you are traveling with kids they are only allowed to sit and eat in 2 and one is the gift shop they have awesome arcade games but the kids are NOT allowed to play because they are in the bar/gaming area they do have about 6-7 games for kids from the 80's. Of I was not tired and sore from driving 5+ hours I would have turned around and go back to railroad pass or go to Kingman, AZ. I will NOT ever stop here again. Not even to use the restroom as they are not clean and after letting a staff member know nothing had been done an hour or so later that let's me know they just don't care.  The best thing about this place is learning some history about the Hoover dam."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick bite at 10pm.  The cafe was closed, but Bourbon Street wasn't.  My coworker and I were met with the friendly smiles of the kind and pleasant staff at Bourbon Street.  The place is a sports bar/grill/casino/arcade and it's pretty cool.  To be fair, the food wasn't amazing.  I mean, it was better than expected but don't expect a Michelin Star on the menu any time soon.  Still, we were happy and had fun.  The place is cash only, by the way.  Just a little FYI."}
{"text":"Quiet and beautiful place to stop before you head to Vegas or Arizona. The rooms are beautiful with a choice of Moutain or lake view. The food is mediocre and the drinks are watered down since they are free with play. Over all it's worth a stop, late check out option available as well. They have discounts and plenty of tourist attractions such as the Hoover dam, Heli tours, zip-lining, mountain top bike trails and more."}
{"text":"This was a nice quiet stay.  Parking was a little frustrating as we had to haul our stuff quite a ways.  At night it's hard to see the little trail behind the hotel. It's got gorgeous views in the morning though! They offer pet friendly rooms which is important. Overall it was a nice stay! :)"}
{"text":"Rooms were exactly what we expected for the price we paid, front desk was friendly and helpful. Hillary on the bar is fantastic. Great to talk with, fast, funny and helpful. 5 stars for Hillary."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I'm a very honest person. And, even though I still give zero stars to the two ladies, Nicole & Mary, for being very rude & bitter. I must tell you that I received a very wonderful phone call in the morning from Martina, the general manager. She sincerely apologized for the behavior of her employees & she promised me that she will make things better. She seemed very genuine & sincere. She also asked me about three times to please come & visit again! I now think differently about Hoover dam lodge and I hope to visit someday in the future. Hopefully, there will be either different employees there or the former employees will be a lot nicer & show good customer service. Thank you so much, Martina!"}
{"text":"The little baby is excellent. It's clean, spacious and inviting. It's very family-friendly and has a decent arcade - I came here with two of my teenage nieces and my teenage nephew. The rooms are very basic but clean and spacious. They come with a microwave and medium size fridge. My sister has a room with two king size beds. She requested a cot for one of her kids and was told that it was a fire hazard. My husband and I checked in early and they allowed us to check in immediately. As soon as we got into our room, our toilet overflowed. We called the front desk and it was taken care of and cleaned up immediately. Overall, for the price, we were very surprised at the cleanliness and quality of the hotel. We'd definitely stay here again."}
{"text":"The Good: The front desk agent was super friendly and funny. Gave us free cold water bottles. The room was very spacious and the beds huge. Small basket with free treats. Cafe breakfast omelette and hashbrowns were filling and tasty.  The Bad: The room had a strong, horrible cigarette and cologne smell. Scratchy-feeling bedsheets. Terrible quality TV. Very slow wifi."}
{"text":"Nice casino floor. Less than average hotel room.   After a stroll through the casino, we thought, how about we just stay here the night? It seems nice, and we can go to the dam in the morning.   We go to the desk and there is availability! They show us photos of the room (which looks nothing like it - more about that next) and we book it.   When we get to the room, it is sparse - it's like there are empty spaces to fill but they decided to save money on furnishing.   Three things irked me about this room. The previous guests' swimming trunks was left in the bathroom. Then toilet is clogged and it's not because I took a dump (it was a number one). Finally, in the early morning while I was watching TV, something caught my attention in the corner of my eye. It was a cricket!  Aside from all this mess, there was some good to go with the bad... Free candy!... That is all.   Everything else seemed standard of what you'd expect from a hotel/resort.   If it was an emergency, I'd stay again. But if not, I'd stay away."}
{"text":"The renovation is gorgeous, they did an excellent job. Still some construction going on inside. I also ate at \"The Bighorn Cafe\" and had the best, fresh Cobb Salad. Steven ( server ) was so nice and friendly!! Thank you Steven!!"}
{"text":"Didn't stay but I did play! Out by Hoover Dam, this little casino and lodge is really dam great. Decorated in semi-modernized frontier lodge wood and stone, it never felt claustrophobic. Service is fantastic. Belly up to the bar and ask Beth for a drink. She can sling a powerful and tasty beverage. She made a martini that could subdue a charging rhino, very potent and dirty with olives . If you are driving to Vegas, stop here. The little gift shop is a rare treasure chest of liquor, less than $10 for 750ml of Pinnacle Vodka, just to name one. Sports is always on the TVs in the bar. I'd definitely consider staying here but will surely stop here for alcohol before driving into Las Vegas. Get the player's club card, even if you don't plan on coming back. I can't wait to try the food, mountain bike the trails, slide on a cable over the gorge, and get out on the lake. It's a vacation from the vacation. There are even Grand Canyon helicopter flights from the back door of this place, surprisingly fun."}
{"text":"It seemed like a no-brainer to book a night at the Hoover Dam Lodge for the day we were at the Hoover Dam, because it was so close.   After visiting the dam, we were excited to check into the hotel, and immediately take advantage of the pool. However, that did not happen since their check-in time is at four o'clock, and not the three o'clock like most other hotels have.   The room was big; too big, to be honest. It had a lot of empty space inside, almost like it was meant to hold another bed. But, the bed we had was very comfortable. They didn't have any vending machines on our floor, but there was a twenty-four-convenience store located on the ground level, which served my late night, diet soda cravings.   The pool was the perfect escape from the blistering weather. It wasn't too cold, so jumping in didn't give us a shock. It is small, so it does fill up fast. Also on sight is a hot tub, which we did briefly use. It was nice for relaxing, minus the jets that shot water over a foot in the air. Leaving them off is probably the best way to maximize comfortability.   We had late night drinks at the bar. Two tall glasses of White Russians cost me only $10.50, which is a steal.   Overall, this place is decent. If you plan on finding something close to the Hoover Dam, then this is definitely the way to go.   Take note that they will take a $50.00, refundable deposit upon check-in."}
