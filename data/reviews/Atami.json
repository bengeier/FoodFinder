{"text":"This is the worse sushi place I've ever visited. I was in this place a year ago, and the sushi was horrible while the prices were expensive (~$7 for a roll)."}
{"text":"On est allé un vendredi soir et quelle belle surprise ce petit restaurant! Pour un fan de sushi c'est incontestablement une des places à essayer à Montréal.J'ai aimé tout: le service, les boissons et surtout les sushis. Et le tout pour des prix raisonnables.Je vais y retourner."}
{"text":"Went there last night .. Just wow!!! the service was spot on . The food was flavourful and keeps you wanting more .  Just all around great . Definitely some of the best sushi I've had and the plating was vey nice and elegant !"}
{"text":"The sushis were amazing, the service was awesome, not close to what I am used to going to sushi bars or restaurants On top of that the music was really good, even asked for the playlist... Spent a lot of money but didn't regret it one bit"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here before going out for the evening and we thought it was great. I had the Sushi & Sashimi plate and my wife had the Matsu Sushi plate. The service was quick and the sushi and sashimi were excellent.  The only reason I am giving them 4 stars is because I found it quite dark and it was difficult fo read the menu. I found myself having to constantly twist and turn to find some light so I could see what was on the menu. That being said, it won't stop me from going back again."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in the city. I got several times a month and the quality and service is always top notch."}
{"text":"Great service, nice terrace in the summer and delicious food. I always order the volcano and the tempura appetizer when I go. It's a must to try all the specialty sushi rolls that they have, you won't find them any where else! I would definitely recommend this place to all the sushi lovers out there. They also deliver if you are in the area, so that's always a plus! :)"}
{"text":"Probably the best sushi you can get in Montreal. it is always fresh and nicely designed. The lunch menu has several options you can choose from and it comes with souo,salad and a tea plus cookie afterward. Staff are friendly and respectful."}
{"text":"This is the first sushi restaurant to open in the area! They've been running for 20 years and they are pretty consistent!   The sushi chefs puts so much passion and apply themselves. They always make sure that everything is to the clients liking and of course, everything is fresh! They are one of the rare restaurants that offers butterfish.   The prices are very reasonable and you have a decent portion. If it's your first experience, you should try the \"chef's choice\" for 35$ each. You tell the chef what you like to eat and he makes you 3-4 services depending on the portions! Def worth it. They also have wine list with decent price. On a hot sunny day, soak up the sun in their terrace with a nice cocktail or sangria. The service is good. They offer delivery service for an extra charge of 5$.   You won't regret your experience at Atami."}
{"text":"Beautiful, delicious, fresh and not expensive. They give several steps forward in the creativity of their dishes. If you go at lunchtime, try the Orchid salad. Fantastic! The only issue is location and the not updated decor. I use to lunch there a lot and it always great."}
{"text":"It was really good the food, service was decent. Only thing that surprised me was, some people came in with a guitar trying to collect money for their country.. They came disturbing us AnD other customers like they owned the place. The staff had to tell them to get out.. It was really weird... But other than that the food,restaurant and service were great!"}
{"text":"Great place, the service was excellent. My friend had no appetizer with her meal, so to not let me eat mine alone, the house offered her a miso soup too! I found a great touch Let's talk about the food, I ordered the sushi (11 pieces) variety and the pizza sushi was to die for, made with kanikama. The variety was great, all specialities. My friend got a salad. She goes there since a while and I'm very happy to had discovered this amazing place! Its located on a second floor of the building, as I would not have gone straight up. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Un bon endroit pour des Sushis, Un restaurant convivial, chaleureux, un service irréprochable très attentionné et patient.   À essayer! Un peu cher, mais le spécial du chef à 35$ (minimum) remplit très bien."}
{"text":"Overall, a solid 4!  We went on a Friday night and it was only about 1/3 full so no rezos needed! There's an Asian lady who takes the orders and seems to be doing most of the work. She was quick to respond to requests.  We ordered: - 6 pieces of salmon sashimi--fresh tasting, large thinner cut slices.  Arranged on a bed of spiraled radish (?) with grated ginger on the side and sweet soy sauce.  - 8 pieces of Summer Dream--really really delicious!! The rice wrapper was just the right texture and all the ingredients (mango, avocado, salmon, cucumbers, fish roe) blended so well together with the sauce. It was so fresh tasting. Definitely recommend!  - 5 pieces of Kamikaze--this was only \"ok\" because the  tempura wasn't crispy. - 5 pieces of Spicy Deluxe--the pickled radish was soggy so it wasn't great so just another average plate.   It's a very decent sushi place, with a decent ambiance. The experience will depend on what you order.  I would go again!  The terrace looks like it'll make a lovely dining spot."}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi! Honestly worth the detour. The lobster sushi is off the charts as well as the smoked salmon. Great speedy service and quality ingredients at a decent price point! Worth it!"}
{"text":"Atami is one of the best sushi in Mtl, their sashimi is always fresh.Try the Pizza sushi,Mickey,and all of their specialitys!!"}
{"text":"Great value for your dollar at Atami! While this wouldn't be considered a high end/fancy sushi restaurant , it is no frills but they deliver on freshness, price , service and location.   The space is modern, comfortable and clean with lots of seating inside and out on the patio. The restaurant fills up fast at peak time but even when busy there's lots of space so it doesn't feel crowded. Service was very pleasant and on point/attentive.    You wouldn't come here to experience anything exotic or outside the box in the way of creative sushi rolls, they are more about serving the more common varieties. BUT that being said everything we had was prepared with care and tasted very fresh.  We had the spicy tuna, spicy salmon, Kamikaze, California , shrimp sushi and salmon sashimi.  Perfect to satisfy a sushi craving !  I tried the Green Tea ice cream for dessert , it was nice and light/refreshing, and not too sweet.   Their prices are more than fair and such a great value for what you pay for ! Definitely coming back here and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"3.5**  Food was good but LONG wait. I came here with two friends on a Saturday night and had a reservation for 7:00. The place is not fancy but seems to be well-liked as tons of people came for takeout/delivery. The restaurant was pretty full while we were there as well. This may have been the problem as I think the kitchen was a bit overwhelmed. The food took a really long time to come (around an hour till our first rolls came) so that got a little frustrating. We ordered a tempura, 3 specialty rolls and 3-4 regular rolls. We enjoyed most of the rolls but preferred the specialty ones. \"Tango Mango\" and \"The Tropical\" were our favourites. \"Hell\", which was a fried roll with cooked salmon was also unique and yum. The quality was pretty good, not the best sushi I have had but one of the few good places in the area. Our waitress was super friendly and was apologetic for the wait.  Overall, good meal but we will probably do pickup next time."}
{"text":"I was surprised how busy this resto was on a Tuesday night. I went because I was in the area and the reviews on yelp were good.   I ordered the lobster sushi roll which contained grilled lobster, avocado, cucumber, caviar, crab stick and dill mayo. It was a bit on the chewy side but I did love the fact that they put dill in the sushi. This is off their sushi menu.   Then came tropical sushi (8pcs). I ordered it because it had no rice and the waitress recommended it. I don't think I've ever had sushi without rice before this. It was good. Especially for those who want to cut down on carbs. It contained spicy crabmeat, cucumber, avocado, caviar, pineapple, spring mix and tempura with a choice of tartare (scallop, tuna or salmon). I chose salmon. Out of the two rolls I  preferred this one. It was on their specialty menu.   These two rolls filled me up. Honestly it wasn't the best sushi. I don't think I would come back."}
{"text":"Decent sushi here. Good selection at reasonable prices. However, service when I was here was very slow. Waited more than 45 to get my sushi. Ordered a miso soup as a starter as well that took a good 25 min to produce. Once I actually got my food and wanted to pay it was another 20 min wait to get that sorted out. With better service I will come back. Nice patio space!"}
{"text":"They took over and hour to deliver but the wait was worth it! I got Canadian rolls, spicy tuna, dynamite rolls and smoker salmon rolls. It was absolutely delicious. Two thumbs up Atami!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing here. The fish is so fresh and amazing. I would absolutely recommend although it is not fine dining or fancy, it is definitely worth it"}
