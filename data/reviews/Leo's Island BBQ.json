{"text":"1st time visit. Read several positive reviews and thought it would be a good place to take my daughter visiting from Boston. I had the pulled pork and it was excellent. My wife had the fish (MahiMahi) & shrimp and loved it. Both daughters had chicken, orange & lemon pepper, and were very happy with it. Very generous servings. Sides of crab rangoons, cabbage & sticky rice were all very good. Ordered the seafood soup w/crab, shrimp &scallops. That will have to wait for home...too full    Will definitely be back & spread the word"}
{"text":"I love the bbq chicken & crispy shrimp combo. And the Mac salad is so creamy and delicious. My daughter has tried the loco moco and her new favorite is the noodle soup with bbq chicken. Only negative sometimes there is no where to sit because they are too busy!"}
{"text":"I love this place everything is always fresh and piping hot! The food is delicious! I love the staff there very friendly and helpful. I come here all the time with my family everything is very well priced."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, good pricing, and has the best hours of operation. They have saved me on a few Sunday nights. The Misubi, pork steam buns are delicious. The meats are cooked well and tender. The combination portions feed me through 3 meals.  The only other mainland hawaiian bbq establishment I have been this impressed with was a food cart in PDX, and I'm pretty sure I take Leo's over that."}
{"text":"I love this place! A friend recommended it to me. I had never had Hawaiian food before, so I thought it would be fun to try. So far I've had the katsu chicken and kalua pork, both were great and were huge portions. I don't usually like mac salad, but I like it from here. Staff is friendly, and the  food prepared quickly. Will be going back whenever in the Hawaiian"}
{"text":"Macaroni Salad. Let me say it again, Macaroni Salad. These guys excel at good food at good prices. Tried half the menu, enjoyed, now ready for the other half and expect more of the same. Get an Hawaiian Aloha Maid Natural Soda while you wait, and then order something to go, because you will crave it later that week. Good service, quick food that is not 'fast' in flavor. That great middle of quick and tasty."}
{"text":"Been living here in AZ for year and I pretty much come here about once a week. I love this place!  I usually order the same thing, a mini-chicken katsu with extra vegetables instead of rice, so I can't attest much of the other items on their menu.   The macaroni salad is fresh, the vegetables steamed, the katsu sauce a good blend of sweet and spice, and the chicken katsu fried to crispy perfection.   I also usually call my order ahead and pick it up. Saves a lot of time. I swear they either recognize my phone number or my voice because they never ask me for my name anymore. As soon as I walk in, they never ask me what I ordered either and I just hand over my credit card while they hand me a bag of my food. If you don't call ahead, depending on what you order and how many people are there, it can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes for your food to come out.  The staff here is super friendly and nice. The older woman behind the counter always has a smile on her face whenever I see here and wishes me a good day.   On top of that, it's a local business (I believe) and I much prefer supporting small business instead of some huge fast food chain."}
{"text":"The second time I came here, I ordered the pork with macaroni salad. By the end of the day, I had the worst food poisoning of my life!!!! If I could put zero stars I would! Never returning here!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here & was very excited to try the food. Everything was fine until the lady, named LUPE, was very rude serving us our food, however you want to call it. I am very disappointed and did not appreciate her pushy attitude and treated us like we did not know our order. She lacked communication skills and made things harder than it should've been. Finally, she walked away. Lost my appetite. Never coming back thanks to crappy customer service."}
{"text":"Good food! Very reasonably priced. Loved the chicken and the ribs! The pork was too salty for my liking. Pasta salad was delicious!"}
{"text":"Leo's can always be counted on for a good meal! I always get the BBQ chicken combo and my wife loves the Kalua pork. Very consistent with what you get in Hawaii and thats a good thing!"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about. Great food, great price, quick ordering and delivery; all good! I ordered the \"mini\" BBQ chicken plate and it was the perfect size for lunch. Comes with a good variety of food and the quality of food for a \"fast food\" like chain is top notch. If I am ever craving some teriyaki chicken or island food, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Your place is amazing. I'm from California, and there's a ton of Hawaiian BBQ places there, and I can honestly say that your place. Might even out beat most of the places there. Really good food. Especially since you guys give a generous amount of food. Great service. Nothing else, to say. Great job!"}
{"text":"Oh yes. This place is good!"}
{"text":"It's was ok,  rice was steamed,  cost extra for brown rice.  Had the lemon pepper chicken, large quantity of food.  Not great but not bad.   Place was clean and staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Great food and good price. The spam masubi is good if you like spam. I've tried a few things on the menu and have yet to come across anything I didn't like."}
{"text":"Great food, very reasonable prices, and super friendly staff. Love this spot, I hit it up anytime I'm in the area. One of the best island BBQ'S I've been to on the mainland."}
{"text":"Island BBQ and spam musubi. It took a while because they cook everything to order, apparently, so, you should sit down and wait, cos it took like 10-15 minutes to get my order. Next time I might call ahead and pick up. This is a pretty typical islander meal, heavy on carbs like mac salad and rice and barbecued meats, but it is extremely tasty."}
{"text":"I've been now eating at this place enough times to say, \"This place is the spot!!\" First off the service is great, they are very friendly, then I look around and see employees walking around wiping down tables as soon as they are free from the counter, the menu looks good but the food is even better! There always seems to have a very steady flow of customers. I still haven't had a chance to try everything yet because I'm still stuck on the chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken, and ribs which is so delicious! I'm such a big eater and coming for grub at this place is awesome. I'm always full when I'm done for hours. I'm not going anywhere else to eat, they got my business."}
{"text":"This is the first time writing a review on a restaurant so hooray I'm a yelper!lol So anyways about Leo's if you are in need of an island style fixing this is the place to go. Being an islander myself this is probably the best hawaiin BBQ by far in the Phoenix area. I have yet to try their loco moco, but all of their mixed plates are delicious. The teriyaki chicken and short ribs are marinated perfectly with that hawaiin style BBQ sauce. Their spam musubi is awesome, I always have to order a side of that with my meal! Staff is great and very friendly, the only downside that I could possibly see is that they take long sometimes and that the seating at the restaurant is limited. But you can always overlook that especially if you have good customer service and great food, which is what they have. So overall highly recommend anyone whose looking for some good island grub!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome the lemon pepper chicken is amazing cheap prices! I recommend if you're in search for good Hawaiian barbecue this is the place"}
{"text":"I was really happy with what I ordered the staff couldn't have been nicer they seemed to honestly care about our dining experience prices were very reasonable the portions were huge I'll be back"}
{"text":"Okay I'm a white Irish Catholic boy from a suburb of Boston, So the only Islands are Nantucket and the Vineyard....and the best island Castle Island.  This food is amazing my wife is from Brockton and is wicked picky because she doesn't like anything different from Italian, American, Irish it the place they get Chinese on New Years...  She loved it! It was awesome clean and cheap we will make it a reg spot..  Thanks for such an original spot you guys are great"}
{"text":"I usually get the chicken katsu and BBQ beef combo.  I've been to other Hawaiian places like this but, Leo's does it right.  Every time the food comes out good and I have no complaints.  I usually take out and they handle phone in orders as well.   It's in a strip mall and it is not glamorous, but it seems clean.  Good, fast service prepared fresh as you wait.  No complaints. The BBQ beef is the way teriyaki beef should be IMO.  Not that crappy stuff other places make and then poor on the sauce after its cooked, although you can get extra sauces if you want (I usually get one each of the teriyaki and Hawaiian styles). Just Hawaiian done right and good macaroni salad.  I give it 5 stars just for not messing up the flavor of the food."}
{"text":"Grabbed the Island BBQ combo.  The meat was very tender and moist, the rice had just the right amount of stickiness and the customer service was outstanding. I can't wait to try something else the next time I go back.   This is a family owned restaurant. It is immaculately clean and welcoming. Glad to have it in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Food rocks here!! Will definitely be back. Also will probably use them for some simple catering options ;)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Kalua Pork and BBQ chicken combo which includes macaroni salad and two scoops of rice.  The  Kalua Pork was excellent.  I was pleasantly surprised how light it was.  The BBQ chicken was tender but it could have been cooked with more BBQ sauce.  The macaroni salad was good.   I give the food Four Stars and Five Stars for  customer service."}
{"text":"For the price this place has good food, ok environment and friendly staff. We did the seafood soup, seafood mix and chicken katsu and everything was delicious. The macaroni salad is pretty good as I am not typically a fan due to the extra stuff people put in it but theirs is good. If you are looking for good food at a good price I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I grew up in Hawaii (lived there for 20 years) and after moving to the mainland a few years ago, the only good Hawaiian/Korean style BBQ I've had was in Vegas, which the kama'aina refer to as the 9th island due to the many people from Hawaii who've moved there.   Since moving to AZ a year ago, we've only had our cravings satisfied when we go to Vegas, that is, until we found out about Leo's. Granted, it's not 100% authentic, but then again, there's nothing like it out here, especially in the west valley.   The bbq chicken is super tender and tasty, mac salad is superb, and the katsu curry is ono-licious! Musubi's are pretty good, though there's too much rice. The broccoli and the occasional romaine lettuce used to soak up the oils is a bit odd, but it doesn't detract from the flavors at all...most of the time the usual cabbage is still used.   Our first visit there they were playing some uh...\"interesting\" music, but subsequent visits have yielded better results, and it finally has more of a local flavor. Add that to the friendly employees/owner and their awesome food, and they've got a regular customer in me. Until of course, when they add spicy chicken or pork to their menu, which means I'm gonna have to go more often!"}
{"text":"This place is SOOOOOOOOOO good.  The Mac salad is to die for.  The Katsu chicken is moist and the sauce is delicious.  A must try."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The food is super yummy and the people behind the counter are friendly and polite. This is definitely one of my \"go to places\" to eat!"}
{"text":"Really good food and awesome friendly service.  Highly recommend.  The teriyaki chicken and short ribs were great"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, the staff is courteous. I absolutely love any of their chicken dishes and their curry is to die for."}
{"text":"I order the chicken combo with bbq chicken and fried chicken. When I got my order, I asked for a side of bbq sauce and they refused to give me some. Instead  said I can have teriyaki sauce. What? Why would I want that on my bbq? It took 20mins for my food even tho she said 10. Food was.ok, but not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Today was my first time eating here. It's par with most of the Hawaiian barbecue places I've had around the valley if not a little better. I went pretty basic my first time just got the chicken Katsu barbecue chicken and short ribdefinitely a nice late lunch even though there was enough food for two had to stop myself LOL. I will definitely be back The price was right and the staff was friendly next time I think I'll try something a little more adventurous."}
{"text":"Saw this place as I was driving by and decided to stop for lunch. I'm so glad I did. The portions are huge and the Asian short ribs remind me of my mother's kalbi. I even ended up ordering a family meal to go for dinner. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a meal that is packed with calories and guilt but is wonderfully delicious then Leo's is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always great, and the service is really fast. All the BBQ they do here tastes awesome, with the smokiness of the meats and the combination of the macaroni salad and the steamed cabbage vegetables is really good. They have musubi too, seaweed wrapped rice with either BBQ chicken, crispy fish or spam! The spam is really good! You gotta try it! I think its in the katsu sauce. Oh, another thing that separates this Hawaiian BBQ from other Hawaiian BBQ like \"O-n-o\" is that.........their food is not greasy! Clean, Lean, and full of flavor!"}
{"text":"BBQ chicken is bomb! Best Hawaiian BBQ in the whole valley... Plus they serve Spam, enough said!"}
{"text":"This food is so amazing.  I get the #1 combo and sub out the chicken for the beef.  The beef is simply to die for. My wife gets the lemon pepper chicken and has never had a complaint.   I alway recommend this place. It's small and family owed so you always get great service here."}
{"text":"First time at Leo's but will definitely be back.  Fast service,  friendly employees, good atmosphere,  and quality food with large portions."}
{"text":"I grew up living in Hawaii for most summers and I always miss local food. This place is winners. The BBQ mix plate is what I usually get. Or if I'm with my family, we get the family combo. Very good food, big portions, and not too heavy on my wallet. Broke da mout cuz."}
{"text":"Take this review with a grain of salt. I'm pretty picky with meats, and I just didn't really enjoy the chicken or ribs I ordered. The chicken was spongy and almost slimy in texture, and had a ton of fatty chunks I had to pull off. The beef ribs were flabby and super chewy as well. Some people love this type of food but when every other bite has to be pulled out of your mouth it starts to be a little less enjoyable. Everything had great flavor and the prices are fantastic for the amount of food that you get. Worth a shot, you may end up loving it if you don't mind super grissly meat."}
{"text":"Leo' is pretty terrific. My favorites on the menu are the fish (which has a lovely light breading) and the barbecue beef. Both the teriyaki and katsu chicken are decent. I had the udon soup once and it was just ok. This is an order at the counter place and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ chicken mini meal for dinner. Comes with one scoop each of macaroni salad and rice with meat served on top of cabbage/veg. Swapped out mac salad for extra cabbage and brown rice instead of white. Chicken was top notch and was the prefect sized meal for $6."}
{"text":"I had the teriyaki chicken veggie bowl. I couldn't wait to try this place out because of all the raving reviews about how good the chicken is especially. The chicken was very tough, hard to chew on. The veggies underneath the chicken were filled with oil and  had no flavor. I was very disappointed.  I keep on trying to find one thing I was impressed by in my meal, but there is nothing."}
{"text":"Best food on this side ow town. Love the teriyaki bowls!! The service is always great..been coming here for years."}
{"text":"Took almost 30 mins for our food and we were the only ones in here, and another couple came in and got their food same time as we did and they only waited 5 mins!!!"}
{"text":"MMMM! I love this place!!! My favorites include the Chicken Katsu, Orange Chicken, and Moco Loco (or Loco Moco?- I never get that right). The katsu sauce has a great flavor and the chicken is moist with a nice crunchy exterior. Moco Loco is so great! Basically it's a hamburger on rice with fried eggs on top-all covered with delicious gravy. YUM!   The staff is really friendly. They always smile when we are there and are very attentive. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Leo's makes for a great lunch. Any of their seafood dipped in the katsu sauce was fantastic. My only complants where small water cups, and I don't love their terriyaki sauce. Other then those two things I am hooked on Leo's."}
{"text":"Nice, clean, big portions, I just don't like this kind of food.  Flavors aren't my favorite but it was very busy and friendly service. Can't give high stars when I don't love the food. Macaroni salad is bland. But definitely big portions. We had the curry chicken and it was lean and nice. Just not wow on flavor. Daughter had Katauna chicken. Lemon pepper chicken was fine too. Just stuff I could make at home."}
{"text":"Just moved to Phoenix and my wife and I decided we would not eat chain food for a year. We love local and found this place on yelp after leaving Nortdstrom Rack.  Seafood combo was great. Huge portions for the price. Chicken Katsu was also very delicious. All together a great place I don't understand why people eat chain fast food when places like Leo's exist."}
{"text":"Leo's Is My Families favorite Hawaiian food place. The BBQ Chicken is my favorite and the Pork is tender fresh and almost as good as mine. My kids love the macaroni salad so we always get an extra scoop in the family meal. 5 Stars for Leo's and There wonderful friendly staff. It's nice to see all familiar faces every time we go."}
{"text":"the food here is good, and you get a lot for what you pay for. the people here are always friendly, the place is clean. you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Order the seafood mix and everything was nice and fresh. Really like the macaroni salad. Portions were big and the place was really clean."}
{"text":"Got the beef bbq and the chicken without skin it was very good the rice with the veggies and the macaroni is so good"}
{"text":"First time eating here.  Really enjoyed it.  Very authentic and tasty.  Nice to see a family business doing well.  I was most impressed with the macaroni salad.  The noodles weren't overcooked.  Reasonably priced, courteous staff."}
{"text":"This place is great! Nice big portions, deliciously cooked, yummy sauces, and a no hassle menu!"}
{"text":"I got like this fried boneless chicken meal, with curry on the side, mac salad and two scopes of rice. Well the mac salad was good but who can really miss on that. The rice was good but again who could miss. The chicken tasted raw like it wasn't clean right (lemon). Also, the curry sauce was watery and had no real taste just color. Waste of my money...i will not go there again. Customer service was nice but that is only a small part whn u go to eat!"}
{"text":"The service at Leo's was beyond excellent! It was nice, clean & the food was fantastic! Most definitely better than L&L's. It's a small, casual, little sit down joint where the food is made fresh. 5 stars for sure! ^-^"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a find.  Stumbled across this place and was very glad I did.  Great food at a great price.  Liked it so much I went back tonight for a second helping but different selections.  We had the BBQ ribs and chicken, the chicken combo and the island combo - chicken, BBQ beef and short ribs.  Each dish came with steamed veggies (broccoli, carrots and cabbage), a scoop of steamed rice and a scoop of macaroni salad.  Teriyaki and Katsu (sweet and spicy) sauces added to the dish but one of us enjoyed it as is with no sauce added.  I went back the next night for the seafood combo, two pieces of a flaky white fish in a light crispy batter, fried shrimp and BBQ chicken.  Came with the same sides as above.  The seafood was deep fried but neither heavy nor greasy.  I also had the spam musubi, a piece of spam with rice wrapped in seaweed.  This was excellent!  Both spam and seaweed are favorites of mine.  I want to go back to try the moco loco.  If I lived in this town, I would start at one end of the menu and wouldn't stop until I reached the end and had sampled every item.  This place is most definitely someplace you should visit."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, and portions are huge.  The island fish is flaky and tender, yummy!!"}
{"text":"You receive a lot of food, but it's not that great. I was intrigued to try after the good reviews and the uniqueness of the food, but I was let down. Kinda just average leaning towards bland. Reheating leftovers did not help either."}
{"text":"Good food. Good price. Good people. Had the Island BBQ Mix. Very good ang a lot of food!"}
{"text":"Well,  I've tried this place 3 times now.  Each time I got something different and just simply did not like it much.  The rice is very dry and bland.  The meat is always overcooked and tough.  The service is good and prices typical but I personally just can't tolerate the food.  I gave it 3 chances."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions, wonderful taste all at a very good price.   We'll be coming back again."}
{"text":"Workers didn't really speak English, nothing super special about the restaurant. However, food was fairly priced with big portions. Would return again after trying new places."}
{"text":"Food is on point, too bad the customer service sucks. The male kid behind the counter looks like he hates his job and hates everyone who walks in the door. No greeting, no smile, no thank you. Just rude. it makes walking in towards the counter very uncomfortable. Owner needs to train their staff."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting some family, and stopped by this place mainly based on reviews here. I was not disappointed; the was very flavorful, really almost the best bbq I had in a while. It's a small place; so pretty packed during lunch time. Employees were very friendly and seem to enjoy what they do. I would recommend it to anyone. So so good."}
{"text":"The clean and bright environment was rather deceptive once the food arrived....awful!  The only thing I could actually taste anything worthwhile was the pork.  The katsu chicken was thin, dry, dark, bland and rigid.  The ribs were full of fat, gristle and very little meat.   I didn't even like the rice or macaroni salad. I'm not sure how you could even mess up cabbage and vegetables, but they did!   I have eaten at other island BBQ's, and the quality at this restaurant is very different.               I could not imagine bringing friends or family here,  I certainly would not give any recommendation to anyone else until the food is up to a decent standard.              Do yourself a favor and move on to another restaurant that takes pride in what they serve, not just slinging whatever comes out of the freezer bag, that's exactly what the food looked like.  If the rest of the food is this bad, this place is in deep trouble.  I don't plan to repeat this gastrointestinal disaster in the near future."}
{"text":"5 stars based on great food, generous portions, cleanliness, prices and friendliness of staff.   I had the chicken teriyaki bowl which was delicious and definitely plenty of food. My boyfriend had the katsu chicken which had enough to take home and tastes great! We shared the egg rolls which were excellent as well.   My bowl was only $5 and out whole meal, including drinks was $20. We will be returning!"}
{"text":"I've been back several times since my first visit, and it's still AWESOME! It's clean, very super fresh food.  The staff are always friendly.  I've had a variety of things from the menu and it's all so freakin' good.  The chicken curry is yummy, however it's on the spicy side :) as in runny nose and sweaty forehead kind of spicy....and I eat Thai and indian food..just sayin'. LOVE LOVE LOVE Leo's !!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Haven't ever had a bad meal there and it always just seems so friendly and inviting. The food is unparalleled. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"The food was good and lots of it.  You may want to consider sharing a dish with someone."}
{"text":"It was good. I ordered the short ribs platter and it was tender and delicious. It came with fried rice (extra charge), mixed veggie and macaroni salad. The veggie really balances out the heaviness of short rib, so it was a nice refreshing touch. I wish the portion was a bit bigger, but it didn't bother me much."}
{"text":"I just don't get the high rating for this place. We tried for the first time, today.  We shared a bbq rib and chicken combo. It came with fried rice, steamed cabbage, and macaroni salad. Basic, plain food. Also ordered steamed pork buns, which were good. We have been to Hawaii at least eight times. The plate lunches there were also two scoops of rice, macaroni salad, and a meat, but much better flavor. That being said, clean restaurant, and friendly employees, just ok food."}
{"text":"Island bbq mix is my favorite. I always do takeout because i don't like the smell in there, but the food is legit."}
{"text":"The food was your typical Island's bbq.  Very friendly staff and the place is nice and clean."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Leo's at least once a week for for awhile now because, well, it's just that good. Outstanding lunch today. Family run, they are so nice and make you feel like a part of their family."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to their seafood soup and combo platters. Great unique food for an affordable price. Love this place for a lunch spot or quick to go dinner."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time today and will be coming back.  The 3 meat BBQ combo was flavorful, the place was clean, the prices reasonable, and I have no complaints about the service.  It's still an order-at-the-counter type place, so don't expect any life altering cuisine, but it's done very well for what it is."}
{"text":"Pasta is cookie cutter style, straight from a tub. Bbq ribs are amazing. Tender and sweet. All the rest is meh."}
{"text":"Always great food and the most friendliest staff around. Been going here for a few years and never left disappointed. Portions are large enough to share or if can't finish it you'll have plenty for a next meal. Good variety of options to even include kids meals. Support a family business and keep this place open. Worth a trip for amazing Hawaiian food."}
{"text":"I stopped here after paddle boarding on Lake Pleasant and I must say, this was the perfect little pit stop on the way back to Phoenix. I'm kind of a noob when it comes to Hawaiian food but was lucky enough to try some when I visited California earlier this year. The restaurant itself is pretty small with about 10 tables and a few tables outside. The staff were friendly and really helpful in explaining the different menu items. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to eat so I went with the Spam Masubi, fried shrimp, and the Chicken and Rib plate. Here are my thoughts:   1. Spam Masubi - Awesome! Loved the saltiness of the spam (would have preferred it fried a bit crispier), sweetness of the sauce, and texture of the rice. The rice was not too dry or mushy, so just perfect.   2. The Chicken and Rib plate was HUMONGOUS. I recommend sharing this with another person because no human should be consuming that many carbs in one sitting. This meal came with chicken katsu, hawaiian bbq chicken, and sweet short ribs. It was served with two large scoops of white rice, boiled cabbage and broccoli, and macaroni salad. This meal definitely hit the spot because there was a little bit of everything - the chicken katsu was juicy and crispy, bbq chicken was savory and sweet, and the short ribs were really tender. I personally love boiled cabbage so it was a nice complement to the flavorful meats. The macaroni salad was creamy and mild but not overly rich.   3. The fried shrimp was tasty and the panko flakes gave it a good texture. I liked how the butterflied the shrimp, making it easier to eat. I dipped it in the teriyaki sauce.   Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you are craving some good quality Hawaiian food at a very reasonable price. The food took a tad long to come out (10-15 minutes) but was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Leo Island BBQ it's a nice clean place and employees are very nice . Excellent customer service ! I gave it 3 stars because for me it was just ok . It tasted good but it was just ok . That is just my 411 you can form your own opinion when you give it a try ."}
{"text":"I have been a patron from the day they have opened.  The atmosphere is warm, and inviting, and the people are soooo friendly!  I LOVE each and every dish, and I have tried all but two.  The food is delicious, the cost is a bargain for the portions, and quality .  The restaurant is IMMACULATE.   I hope they never close their doors !"}
{"text":"It took 20 minutes to get our food... And it's a \"fast\" food joint. I had the locomoco. The eggs were over cooked and the hamburger steak was dry. Mac salad was good though. Still. Was a pretty sad excuse for local kine food. Wish there was a place with some garlic chicken like they had at zippys or aiea bowl back  in the aloha state... Cheeeeeeeehooooooo"}
{"text":"Got the bbq chicken and teriyaki chicken.. Both were good. Not really any different then all the other hawaiian bbq places I have been to. We will be coming back here. Service was ok.. Not like they go out of their way but at least the lady at the counter was thanking all of her customers for coming in."}
{"text":"Great little place, good food. Very friendly staff. I would definitely eat here again. Their food is comparable in quality to what you would get in the islands."}
{"text":"Leo's has amazing food at such reasonable prices! You can't beat the plates here for the price and quality. I love the Lemon Pepper Chicken. It is the most flavorful and tender piece of chicken breast and the light marinade they cook it in is super tasty. All of their plates come with rice and macaroni salad. I still don't understand how restaurants can charge extra for brown rice in today's day, but that is one thing they do. Still, if you have a craving for quick, delicious, and cheap Hawaiian food, Leo's is a must!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Hawaiian style plate lunch. The service was quick and delivery of the food to me was timely and clearly fresh made, still hot after I drove it back to Scottsdale. Had the chicken plater, with the short ribs. The Mac salad is the Hawaiian plate lunch standard but hits the spot, you can also get fried rice instead of plain white which is a nice touch. My wife got the garlic shrimp it was served with gravy which we found different from what we ever experienced but putting it on her rice made it even better she said. Make sure to grab extra sauce if you're heading out, not sure if it was a mistake or misunderstanding but I only had the one I grabbed for my katsu chicken even though the guy said there was some in there already. Fantastic experience aside from that. Ono grinds!"}
{"text":"Ok, why didn't someone tell me this is a renamed Ono Hawaiian BBQ before I drove the 35 miles to eat at this highly rated \"restaurant\"?  The place looks like Ono, the menu is just like Ono, the food tastes just like Ono, the sauces are just like Ono, the only thing I could find different was the name of the place.  Food was not bad but it was definitely not great plate lunch that I have had at other Hawaiian BBQ joints.  I have a Ono right by my house and eat there often and there was absolutely nothing different about Leo's Island BBQ and was a waste drive the 70 miles round trip to eat at this place when I could have got the same thing right down the block."}
{"text":"Come to get your Arrowhead chicken curry katsu fix! Always crowded but service is pretty fast!"}
{"text":"I love this place :) found this little gem tonight while looking for a place to chow down. It was squeaky clean and the staff was nice. I ordered the chicken teriyaki plate,& the portions were huge. Its super cheap and way delish, looking forward to going here again soon."}
{"text":"Looking for that meal that you had in Hawaii, look no further. Plate lunches from chicken katsu to loco mock this place will satisfy your cravings. Being from Hawaii this place comes very close to the real deal.  Very good prices, serving size, and awesome custoner service!"}
{"text":"Came out to Peoria for some Padre Spring Training, take in a few games and even took in a hockey game on whim.  Prior to out arrival we yelped a bunch of places to check out and eat.  Leo's happened to be one of them given it's location to Peoria Sports Complex.  So the day would come when we figured out the practice schedule and stopped in for a bite to eat before watching our first Padre practice.    We located, parked and walked in.  I hate the pressure of the clerk behind the counter staring all the while not offering any sort of assistance while we sort out our selection. Not really rude but more indifferent to our first time experience. But having been to many a style joint like this, we ordered up. Curry Chicken Katsu (good), Grilled Fish (non-eventful), Pineapple Chicken (tasty), Carb Rangoon (fine), two Spam Masubis (fine).  It all eventually proved our eyes were bigger than our stomachs.  The gentleman who dropped the food off at the table was friendly. I wish he would have been behind the counter.  The food was solid.  The entries were in abundance but the mac salad was a smaller portion.    Happy to have experienced this A-OK of an Island comfort food establishment in the Sonoran desert."}
{"text":"Been to Maui 3 times, still think Hawaiian food is done better here. Best Hawaiian BBQ I have ever had. Been coming here for almost 3 years, and have no intentions of ever stopping."}
{"text":"What a fantastic little hidden gem. Leo's had...Amazing food! We had the family meal and chose BBQ beef, curry chicken, & pork as our entrees...they were all flavored perfectly. Absolutely no need for any spices. I also really enjoyed the macaroni salad, I would just add a little salt and pepper to taste.  I always love finding a new \"Spot\", this is one for sure."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, huge portions, great price. Was a little concerned when I saw it was served in styrofoam, but was thoroughly impressed with the flavor."}
{"text":"Clean, great service, and fresh food! We come here at least once every other month and I am always impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant. I always go with the classic lemon pepper chicken combo with rice, macaroni, and vegetables; it never disappoints."}
{"text":"They make some items better than L&L, but L&L is going downhill. It is kinda pricey. for dessert go next door at Baskin and Robins and get the chocolate with peanut butter ice cream."}
{"text":"Eh cuz, I like make da kine public service announcement first for all da buggahs stay writin' reviews for anykine Hawaiian place. No such thing as Kahlua pig. We no put da kine coffee liqueur and shit on da pig, bra. Also, no moa Kailua Pig either, bra. You buy pig or pork in Kailua and bring em' back to Honolulu and you goin' be takin' pig/pork on da kine, Pali Highway. First thing goin' happen is yo' car goin' stall right on da highway, bra. Next da night marchers goin' carjack your car. Then Madam pele and da limu lady - two of da baddest tittas on da island goin' take you to Morgan's corner and bang yo' head on the 13 steps, bra. By da time they done with you, you goin' forget about evah callin' it Kailua pig. It's Kalua, bra. Ok bruddah. Enough of the public service announcements. Dis place stay in one mall next to one Barnes and Nobles. I went come here plenty times. One pake family stay run this place and they do one pretty good job of making island kine plate lunches. Fo' me L&L in North Phoenix is still da best but when I no like drive too far this stay second best. I usually get one of da combo meals, bra - that's the way to go. This blala gives dis place the big shaka sign. Bettah than pig. Bettah than poi. I no shit you. Best Hawaiian food this part of town, bra. One thing - da guy who take da order, bra, he never say nothing. I think he stay da kine - android from Kikaida. I no say nothing bumbai he turn into da kine - red mask and blue suit and chase me out of da store with one spear shouting \"git 'em! git 'em!\""}
{"text":"Not a bad little place.  I dropped in on this place after skipping out on work early.  I was pretty damn hungry, and after walking by Leo's, I just thought that I would drop in.  I got the BBQ Sampler, which I thought was a good first look.  The short ribs were good, the chicken was great, and the macaroni salad was pretty darn good too.    The only complaint that I had was that after eating, I felt like I had just eaten a pound of salt.  oh well, that's just the way some of those dishes are.  Overall, my food and experience was good.  I got a ton of food, and the price was fair for what I got.  This was my first HI BBQ experience in AZ.....so, not bad.  It's not like the stuff I got back home in CA, but it will do.  Looking forward to my next trip back."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing staff!  I love going here for the macaroni salad!  It is the BEST.  I look forward to it every time!  My fiancé doesn't like macaroni salad so even better for me! :D.   He loves the BBQ beef and short ribs.  I have loved everything I have tried.  Chicken, shrimp, beef -- it's all great.  You cannot go wrong with stopping here for lunch or dinner.  They serve perfectly cooked veggies with the meal too.  Excellent place to eat.  Always clean and always friendly!  Definitely recommending to my friends!"}
{"text":"Deeeeeelicious. My boyfriend and I were in the mood for something different than our usual take out. We both enjoy Hawaiian food quite a bit, so after a little yelp searching I came across this gem. I called in and ordered a beef plate and a chicken/pulled pork combo plate for pick up and was told it'd be ready in 14 minutes. Sure enough it was ready, bagged and smelling intoxicatingly divine when I went in to pick it up. I didn't check the orders before I left, but loaded up on the sauce and went on my way. When we got back and opened up the containers I realized that I had the wrong order. Instead of a combo plate with chicken and pulled pork I received just a pulled pork plate-- no worries miscommunications happen over the phone and although this could have been prevented by having my order read back to me or by me checking my order before I left, I don't see the point in being upset about it. Shoulda, Coulda, Wouldas. Truth be told I didn't want to go back out, I was feeling pretty ravenous and it looked so delicious I had to dig in.   Nom. Nom. Nom. That's all that was to be heard while we were stuffing our faces. We substituted the rice for extra macaroni salad (yummy!), but that's just our general preference. The beef was tender melt in your mouth scrumptious and the pulled pork, although a little salty, was pretty tasty as well.   We paid just under 20$ for both plates, but there's enough food leftover for at least another meal, maybe even two. For the portion sizes and dynamite flavor I give this place 5 stars. If it was an option I would knock off half a star just because I wish I would have been able to try the chicken, since that's what I was eagerly anticipating... but there's always next time."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp after moving in down the street. So glad I decided to give it a try. The staff was so helpful with explaining the menu and the food was yummy! I had the BBQ chicken and beef. My girlfriend had the BBQ chicken/shrimp combo. Both came with two scoops of rice, veggies and macaroni salad. The meats were soft and tender and the veggies were crunchy. Loved the macaroni salad too! Definitely going back to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Hawaiian BBQ place is not close to home, that being said we were so excited to see that Leo's Island BBQ opened up. The food is great and always fresh, a family favorite for sure. I normally order the chicken katsu and my boyfriend likes the chicken/ seafood mix with chicken, fish & fried shrimp. The macaroni salad is great, fresh & creamy just how it should be. The staff is super friendly. Long story short, we love Leo's Island BBQ; hope they are around for a long time!"}
{"text":"The excellent rating is well deserved. The chicken Katsu is some of the best I've had. Everything else was very, very good. The serving sizes are gigantic."}
{"text":"Went to Leo's yesterday - ordered Loco Moco  took the plate to the guy who sent me to get it and it was NOT Loco Moco or even close.  I had to go get the guy something else to eat.  Anybody who has lived in Hawaii knows what Loco Moco is - hamburger patty, over rice with gravy and over easy egg on top - along with mac salad and rice.  This had NO gravy - no egg and some sort of cabbage thing with broccoli.  So I called today and asked for the \"manage\" I hear her saying in the background - she wants manager and some guy named Eric comes on the phone insisting he is the \"manager\" - I doubt it.  I explained the situaiton and he says - you sure you ordered Loco Moco - I said - you sure you know what Loco Moco is?  We are from the islands We know Loco Moco and this wasn't it.  He said oh, maybe you ordered something different - now I am getting upset and he is acting like he has no clue.  I intend to dispute this with Visa as I am NOT paying for what I did NOT get.  He offered nothing - not even an apology.  You can fool local people with this \"Hawaiian food\" thing but not those of us who know.  We won't go back."}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian BBQ place. I drive 40mins for this place each time. Super busy during lunch so plan ahead."}
{"text":"All I have eaten here is loco moco... haven't felt the need to see if there's anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Been coming here over 5 years and even though prices have gone up a little the quality and portions have not gone down. Their teriyaki beef is very tender and not fatty unlike other places that have gone to using cheaper cuts of meat. We've tried a half dozen other places in the valley but Leo's remains at the top of our list."}
{"text":"Very good fresh and quality food.  The staff is very helpful and nice.  They definitely have a variety menu not just a few items.  Keep up the great service and quality"}
{"text":"The best word I could use to describe the food here: juicy (except the fried chicken stripes).  The type of BBQ is something in between Japanese BBQ and your typical Kansa city BBQ. It is spiced--but not smothered; it is thoroughly cooked, but not dry; It is juicy, but not oily. when you bite down on the short ribs, it is a mouthful of juiciness, meatiness, freshness, and deliciousness.   For a restaurant like this, the rice is decent quality. Not the best, but I am picky about my rice. It wasn't dry or old or cheap quality, it was plump short grain that's medium quality.   For $10-12, you get a balanced meal, decent quality rice, delicious juicy BBQ, vegetables. There is no table service, but as long as the place is clean, the people are nice, the food is really good, I am happy--and according to that standard, this place has it all."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place, the food is delicious and the best thing is that they prepare it when you order it so the food is always hot! The customer service is friendly and they always have it ready by the time they said it would be ready (I usually do take out orders). Definitely recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is small and gets crowded fast. I ordered the short rib plate, and the ribs were good, but there was no seasoning on the macaroni or the veggies. I had to hunt for salt and pepper. Eventually I found some packets on the main counter, as there are none on the tables. Strange. But the ribs were very good, so I would try them again, and bring some seasoning with me ....."}
{"text":"I just left Hawaii after spending almost 15 years total there. I just retired from the Army. I will tell you that my wife and I ate at so many Hawaiian drive-ins in the islands from the chain restaurants (Zippy's, L&L, etc) to some of best small Mom & Pop joints where they barely spoke English. I will tell you that Leo's is pretty damn good!! I know there are a couple more Hawaiian BBQ places in the Valley, but Leo's is pretty much on point as far as capturing island flavors and plate lunches. (Hawaiian term). The staff is courteous. The place is clean and the food is \"Ono\"!  I will give them a big thumbs up on their BBQ Chicken Curry! There were a couple of places in Hawaii that did that, and Leo's does it also!  Their best value is their family pack! My wife and I get with my folks and try to tackle it. We fail!! LOL!! A Lot of delicious food for a good price! They even have Spam Musubi!! They will always get our business!"}
{"text":"MASSIVE amounts of food.  I finally made it over to Leos and glad I did.  3 of us ordered the family meal.  Big mistake...  It came with 5 boxes of food all for 30 bucks.  We got beef, teryiaki chicken, fried fish, rice, vegetables, and macaroni salad.  It was enough food for 7 adults.  No exageration.  The beef, chicken, and macaroni were all awesome.  Huge portions, fresh, flavorful.  I'd eat it daily without a problem.  The rice was rice.  The fried fish was the only thing lacking.  No flavor, flat pieces, a definite misfire.  The rest though was on point.  Leos had a line of customers the whole time we were there and it is easy to see why.  Yelpers got this one right.  Bout time with all you free 5 star handing-no talent-ass clowns tryin to get ROTDs n-shit.  I will come back and will recommend to others."}
{"text":"Good food for great price! The mini BBQ chicken is $5.50 and it is a perfect portion."}
{"text":"5/5 is not good enough to describe Leo's.   The food is amazing, cooked perfectly every single time. They bring it out quickly and yet it is made fresh to order. It is hands down the best Teriyaki I've ever had and the \"island style\" macaroni salad they serve with it is so incredible that if you're not careful you may actually try to steal some one elses, although I recommend just buying more as Leo's has the most fair prices in town. I doubt you'll have to order more though, because they actually give people plenty of food and don't overcharge them either.   It is a small family owned place. The service is top notch, they are very friendly, professional, full of smiles and always on top of keeping the place (which is very nicely decorated with comfortable furniture) spotless clean.   Please, Leo's, KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING, DON'T CHANGE ANYTHING, it just works perfectly.  If I go more than a week without Leo's I fall into a deep dark depression..."}
{"text":"Leo's staff is very friendly all the time.  I have ordered the chicken katsu which comes with fresh cabbage, white rice, and macaroni salad. Every time I come here, I order double macaroni with no rice and they do it for me. YUM! The chicken has been hard. stale, and tasted funky to me before.   The cleanliness and attractiveness of the store is a bit lacking. Price is reasonable. This place is pretty decent."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this place. My favorite is the chicken katsu. The food is awesome and the portions are huge. It doesn't get much better."}
{"text":"Place is small but nice, chairs aren't so comfortable for me. Let's start off by saying the service is excellent. The people are nice and they talk unlike most places! The best thing is the Teriyaki sauce holy that thing is tasty you can put it on anything the foods good I've tried a couple of things. The spots good just would like to see some TVs and different music."}
{"text":"Service is great - always lots of genuine smiles and earnest employees trying to make the customer happy. Food is always great, and is enough for at least two or more meals!"}
{"text":"I'll go generous on my 3.5 stars for Leo's.  The staff is super friendly and the restaurant is spotless.  I ordered the Kalua pig plate lunch and found the rice to be, well, plain rice as it should be and the macaroni salad was also good and simple as it should be. Now, I've had the real deal when visiting Hawaii-whole hog lathered with salt and wrapped in banana leaves cooked in an imu (big hole in the ground).  I think the county health dept. would take issue with that cooking method, so I'm not going to fault Leo's for that :)  But at least IMHO the pork needed more salt-it was tender with a hint of smoke but was underseasoned.  And Kalua Pig should make me retain water just lookin' at it!!  My opinion, if you think L&L's is too salty you might enjoy Leo's. All in all I will return and try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Definetely my favorite place on the west side for fast hawaiian food. Usually order the BBQ chicken and the Chicken katsu plate lunch."}
{"text":"Only eaten here once but I loved it. The combination of food seemed weird at first but it actually works really well together. A nice change from the normal fast food type. 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Quick and helpful service.  Good food.  My lemon chicken was good.  My wife's teriyaki chicken even better.  \"This tastes like asian food I grew up with in Seattle\"  was high praise from my wife."}
{"text":"This place is always busy. I can see why as I finally stopped in one day after seeing this place for months. I'm from Hawaii, and to find 'Hawaiian food \" in the north west valley is a joke.   Leo's offers a wide variety of Hawaiian inspired foods. Love me some kahlua pork and cabbage. Taste just like back home. I was stoked  when I seen they offered manapua as well as spam musubi.   They offer a wide variety of local foods, and just like in Hawaii the portions are huge and the price is reasonable.  The staff is friendly, the place is clean, the food is Ono (delicious in Hawaiian).  This place can get real busy during lunch time, but u can also call in your order for pick up. They also offer catering , I haven't used that feature but prolly will with my son's upcoming graduation.   If your ever on this side of time, stop in as you'll be doing your stomach a favor."}
{"text":"Delicious marinated kalbi ribs, chicken and beef. Every time we've gotten ice cream at Baskin and Robbins, I have wondered what Leo's might be serving. One of my kids was not in the mood for sushi, so before we went to B&R, we walked into Leo's. The place was packed. The fragrance of the meats permeated the room. I was already excited. We ordered the Island Mix for under $10. The kalbi had a great Korean BBQ texture. The beef was tender and full of flavor. The chicken had nice grill marks. I couldn't decide which meat I liked better. I enjoyed the cooked cabbage and a serving of steamed rice. I was wary of the macaroni pasta salad. It looked overdressed with mayo, but it actually had a pretty good flavor. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Favorite place on Bell Rd. hands down. Garlic shrimp plate lunch for me and kalua pork and chicken katsu plate lunch for my husband!"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ here, although it does get pretty busy around lunch.  Pretty comparable to L&L although i think I would give the nod to L&L.  I'm giving this place a 3 because even though the food was good it never enticed me to go back and I love protein."}
{"text":"Leo's is awesome! They're short ribs are insane! It's a large portion, rice, and two sides for 10 dollars. If you like Chicken Katsu, you have to try out Leo's Katsu sauce.   The service is good, you walk up to the counter and get your food pretty quickly. This is a casual spot."}
{"text":"The best so far and if you can ask for gravy on your white rice."}
{"text":"I'm not Hawaiian so I don't know what \"real\" Hawaiian food taste like. I assume it taste like this place, cause the food here so very good! The meats are very well marinated, and the rice is cook just right! Their macaroni salad is so good! Katsu chicken is so crunchy and good! I like this place better than Ono Hawaiian. The only problem is their seatings.. Sometimes it gets really busy in their and there are no space to sit and eat. I normally get it Togo cause the place is too small.   Anyways, would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is my go to take out place.  If you're in the mood for this type of food, it is awesome.    This food is normally prepared a little on the greasy end, because, well, it's BBQ Hawaiian food, but somehow it doesn't hit you like \"aw man I feel post big mac and fries.\"  The macaroni melts in your mouth.  Food is always very fresh.  PRICING IS EXCELLENT FOR THE QUALITY OF FOOD.  SERVICE IS TOP NOTCH.  Always sincere, humble, kind, attentive, and smart.  For 5 stars I'd need just a few more healthy options.  Brown rice, more veges."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the rest of the Yelpers. I had the chicken teriyaki, my wife had the pineapple chicken (Grilled) both meals were very good. If your not a big eater I would split a meal, to much to eat. Restraint is very clean, very friendly staff. I would come back again."}
{"text":"I love this place! I was very pleased with the portion size. I ordered the lemon chicken and had a giant piece of chicken left over. And the macaroni salad is to die for!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I put on my best Hawaiian shirt and go to Leo's. I get their lemon pepper chicken and dip it in the katsu sauce. It's not really a traditional move but I play by my own set of rules. The staff is super friendly. If you ask nicely they might even let you substitute the cabbage for an extra side of macaroni salad. It's a risky move but if it pays off, you'll be in pasta heaven."}
{"text":"At first, $7-8 seems like a lot for one meal. Once you get your food, that opinion changes- I got 4 meals out of the amount of chicken they gave me! I tried two different sauces, orange and pineapple. I liked the orange better, but they were both fantastic! It was clean inside, the employees were friendly, and the food came out pretty quickly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is solid.  The lemon pepper chicken in a vegetable bowl is my favorite. It is healthy and tastes wonderful. There is a reason why it is the number one Yelp rated restraunt in  Arrowhead."}
{"text":"Food is delish!!! Portions are huge! Staff very friendly, service is fast and place is clean."}
{"text":"I don't know why I waited so long to try Leo's, but everything I had was amazing.  I had the BBQ chicken and chicken katsu combo, and both were delicious!  Portions were good for the price too.  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"First visit to Leo's today. The food was fantastic! Huge servings. I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Everything we have ordered has been delicious! Have never been disappointed. I particularly love their barbecue chicken. Friendly staff very clean establishment. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Leo's has been consistently awesome since it opened. They've also been a pretty consistent source of desk calendars for me over the years. The food is top notch and I've tried most everything. Personal staples for my wife and I are:  Crab rangoons Crispy Shrimp Chicken Teriyaki bowl Seafood Mix Island BBQ  If you're feeling particularly sinful, their grilled spam moco is so tasty. We usually order to go, but the restaurant is always clean and the staff always friendly and prompt. If you're looking for Hawaiian bbq/teriyaki you really can't go wrong with Leo's."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I've lived here 2 months, a friend and I saw this place our first week here and just tried it out for the first time tonight. I have the chicken and pork combo with fried rice. So stinking good. Tons of food for a great price! 100% recommend!"}
{"text":"Yuup, 5 stars. Hawaiian chicken is super mild but siracha on the side completes  it. Clean, delicious, priced right."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Hawaiian BBQ ive ever had. It was absolutely delicious in every way. Im hooked now for good now. I highly recommend this spot.  *Phoenix Foodies Approved!"}
{"text":"Love the food but customer service is horrible ! I'm sad to write this review because I been going here for years. I tried to call and let them know what was going on the woman that messed up my order she answers the phone and wouldn't let me to speak to the manager told me to come back. I live  20 minutes away no way am I driving all the way back. I hope Leo's can get this together."}
{"text":"Food quality is great, tasty, and always leaves me full! I can always count on it being tasty consistently. The sauces they give are great and not watery. I go to other Hawaiin BBQ eating spots and their sauces aren't always great and their food. I could always count on Leo's to hit the spot! I'm a regular since grand opening and I hope to see this place grow. Love it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food every time. Cheap prices. Fast service. Friendly, family owned business. Just like a little place you would find down in Honolulu."}
{"text":"Awesome hawaiian bbq place! Everything we ordered were delicious. Would go here again and again. Only downside is that they don't do online takeout order, still, i'm willing to wait in line and order."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelpers for helping me find another new lunch spot close to work.  Amongst all the chain spots that dominate the west valley landscape, you can occasionally find a unique local gem hidden within (Mi Comida and Rocket Burger among them).  I saw the glowing reviews for the portions and flavors that Leo's dishes out and it did not disappoint.  I came here with my co-workers on a Friday at lunch.  The place wasn't too busy when we got there, but began filling in shortly thereafter.  The restaurant is relatively hidden amongst the rows of big box stores that surround Arrowhead Mall.  If you go just south of Bell on 77th Ave and look east, you'll see it in time to turn in.  From the outside it looks just like your average fast food joint.  But honestly the first thing I noticed when I walked inside was how clean the place was.  Seriously, it was shockingly spotless everywhere I looked, almost as if it the floors and the furniture were brand new.  The folks at the counter were very friendly and helped describe some of their menu items as many of them trend along the exotic.  From reading Yelper recommendations, it seems like the Island BBQ Mix plate lunch is Leo's 101 here so I went with that and a fountain drink.  Total price was $11.  Took about 10-15 minutes to get our food so its not really a hurry up and go place, but we ate there anyway so we weren't in a hurry.    The photos on Yelp aren't lying.  The portions are huge.  Along with three meats (BBQ chicken, BBQ meat, Kalua pork), my plate came two scoops of cabbage, two scoops of macaroni salad, and two scoops of rice (I went with white, but you can get brown rice for a little bit extra).  First off, the macaroni salad is amazing.  I'm not a big macaroni salad fan, but this was awesome.  I think I tasted some tuna and crab in the salad so that might be their secret.  The meats were also very well prepared.   The meats were pretty lightly sauced, but still full of flavor and super tender.  Hadn't had Kalua pork before, but I was impressed.  Not tender enough to cut with a fork, but still pretty tender.  The beef and chicken were both cooked well and as mentioned earlier there was plenty of it.  The cabbage and rice helped balance out the meal so I didn't feel uncomfortably full when all was said and done.  All in all, really good meal and a great value for the price.  Only negatives I would say were the wait and the temperature in the restaurant.  I would expect a pretty long wait in a sit down place, but this place is barely a sit down restaurant and there was only one customer that ordered ahead of us.  Seems to me they could've sped it up.  It was also pretty warm in there.  Granted it was during a 105 degree day and there's windows all around the restaurant, but they probably could stand to turn the A/C down about 5-10 degrees.  Maybe next time I'll just grab and go.  Overall though, food is excellent and a great option for lunch on the west side of town.  Aloha hunger."}
{"text":"Love love your guys food. Every time I come here with my boyfriend we always come here with a smile, because your guys customer service is always great and the food is delicious. Thank you guys for the effort you put into giving your customers great food and service."}
{"text":"I come here often. The staff is always helpful and friendly. I never remember what I order..silly I know. I just tell them I want the meal that is similar to Korean Bulgoki. It always has a lot of meat and is tasty.  I like the macaroni salad that comes with it too. I prefer to go here vs a chain restaurant. Better to support small business in the area.  Want Hawaiian food give it a try."}
{"text":"Had to be on the west side around lunch time, and spotted a Hawaiian BBQ place to try.  The folks working there were all friendly.  That was a nice start.  I did my normal \"order the meats combo\" at any Hawaiian BBQ. The short ribs were really good.  The chicken was spot on.  The kahlua pork was both tasty and very plentiful.  All served on a bed of cabbage with some broccoli. The rice was good and sticky.  The real defining thing for me at a Hawaiian BBQ is the macaroni salad and, I'm happy to report, Leo's had some good and proper tasting mac salad.   The only knock would be Pepsi products (I'm a Coke guy), but I hear the Coke reps don't service the local restaurants very well and the Pepsi folks take better care of them.    So, if you're hungry and want some good chow - check out Leo's!!"}
{"text":"Quick. Easy. Delicious. Great Prices. Katsu is some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"First time trying Hawaiian food! Got to taste their chicken BBQ, chicken Katsu, and BBQ ribs. The Katsu tasted fresh and crisp! The other dishes were also excellent. They give you a great amount of food for the price. If it was closer to me, it would be a lunchtime favorite"}
{"text":"BBQ chicken is amazing! Big potions at a fantastic price! Highly recommend Leo's island barbecue, staff is very kind."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect. Went for lunch. Ordered the sampler with the chicken, pork and beef. Ordered an order of fish as well, just so I could try as much as possible. Macaroni salad on side. It was all very good. Healthy? I don't think so, but it did taste good. The place was VERY clean and everyone was nice.  Had to wait a little longer for my order as someone came in and obviously ordered for their office.  NOT disappointed as so many other places have left me recently."}
{"text":"It is such a wonderful place to go eat near my house. Despite the fact that the restaurant is small, I don't have any issues. The wait is a little longer than the ono hawaiian that I used to go too. Other than that, I love eating here more than Ono."}
{"text":"I tried this place on a whim on a day that I was especially missing local grindz from Hawaii. Their portions are huge with a meat to rice to mac salad ratio of 2:1:1 - a typical feature of Hawaiian food.   Their kalua pig (shredded pork) was tender and had a nice smokey flavor, and the spam musubi even had oyster sauce, a must for musubi in my opinion. They were nice enough to prepare \"katsu moco\" or chicken katsu (breaded chicken) prepared in the style of a traditional loco moco (sunny side up eggs, and gravy on a bed of rice). The regular loco moco beef patty (Mom, if you're reading this, I swear this is the first time I've had beef in a long, long time!) was a bit odd in texture, but it wasn't bad.  This is a great substitute if you're missing the real thing. I wish they had chicken long rice and lau lau on the menu. Mahalo for the great service!"}
{"text":"It's exactly what I expected and could of wanted. Got the Island BBQ mixed. Loved it. Heard a guy tell them to skip the rice and double the macaroni. I'll be doing that next time."}
{"text":"Good food less wait and awesome employee ... Highly recommended especialy on your job lunch break"}
{"text":"Amazing teriyaki & katsu chicken! Hubby got the Loco Moco & he said it was just as amazing as from when we were in Hawaii. Their teriyaki sauce was phenomenal, I put it on top of the chicken katsu which was sooo perfectly crispy, they complimented each other so well. Can't wait to come back here."}
{"text":"Leo's has some of the best Hawaiian BBQ I've had on the mainland.  Far better than L&L and Ono, I was highly impressed with the freshness and quality of their plates.  I intended to buy a plate to eat for both lunch and dinner because the portions are so generous, but I just kept eating and eating...until I was so stuffed that I felt like I had eaten enough for three meals. SO DARN DELICIOUS.  Service is swift and friendly.    There's only a few small tables which is fine.  It's just as all fast take away food places should be. Definitely worth trying out to anyone feeling like a good Hawaiian meal."}
{"text":"The place is good. Chicken Katsu is stupendous. I gave it a 4/5 star rating only because the nori on the spam musubi was mad soggy and ripped as soon as I breathed on it but the flavor of the musubi itself.... breathtaking. It's not that hard of a thing to make but they did their thing. I didn't even know spam could be succulent, but theirs were!"}
{"text":"If I could eat here everyday, I would. Unfortunately I don't live super close but every time I'm in the neighborhood I come in and get their teriyaki Hawaiian bowl. Delicious, affordable, friendly and they make you feel like family. Thanks Leo's for being as awesome as you are!!!"}
{"text":"Very good, excellent food quality and quantity. Service is courageous in serving chicken katsu curry"}
{"text":"I jumped on the Leo's Island BBQ train after tons of recommendations. It was bomb. I'm stuffed and have plenty of leftovers for dinner! Chicken Katsu and BBQ chicken. I inhaled the macaroni salad. Get extra Katsu sauce!"}
{"text":"After trying chicken katsu at other Hawaiian BBQ places, I appreciate Leo's Island BBQ's version so much more. Since finding Leo's I have loved their chicken katsu for the crispiness, flavor and portion size, which can easily feed 2 adults for dinner. The chicken katsu also stays crispy even after 6 hours. The grilled BBQ chicken is moist and tender, as well.   The restaurant has a parking lot and is clean. It can get busy during the lunch and dinner rush, so I suggest calling in your order ahead of time and picking it up.   What I recommend: -- Chicken Katsu"}
{"text":"Yummy food and friendly staff! Lemon pepper chicken is my fave. And the musubi!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. Call in orders are quickly made and the family who owns Leo's is good to their customers. Food is great! Highly suggested."}
{"text":"Looove the food here. I'm from an island & the bbq plate does not disappoint. It gets pretty crowded and drive half an hour to come, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I am from Southern California and we have many options when it comes to Hawaiian BBQ. I was very happy when I found this gem out here in Phoenix. I only wish that they had more options. I normally order the island BBQ mix which comes with shredded beef, BBQ chicken, and short rib. The short ribs tend to be fattier than I am used to but are still full of flavor. The beef is good but is lacking something. The chicken is bomb. I like all three to some extent which is why I always get the combo! I have eaten here multiple times and will eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have had fresh Hawaiian food in Hawaii, and this place is a nice substitute. Service was friendly and fast. Indoor space is limited but you can choose to take it home, park etc."}
{"text":"Since I'm always on the hunt for different cuisine, I saw a sign for \"Hawaiian food\" and had to stop! Staff was friendly and the place was clean looking. I was impressed by the prices because they were very affordable. Now let's get on to the food... After looking at the menu for what seemed like an eternity (they have a lot of options), I ended up going with the barbecue chicken combo! When I received my food, the portions were very generous. I really enjoyed the macaroni salad and the chicken was very flavorful which I liked. However, I'm more of a fan of white meat, therefore next time I will make sure to order accordingly. With everything being said I really liked this place and I will be returning back for a second serving. PS. I love the Hawaiian soda!"}
{"text":"Wow,  this place is amazingly tasty and affordable!  Came into this place shortly after it opened and i was blown away by the tastiness of their food. The Spam Misubi is tasty and well prepared. The macaroni salad is soo awesome it'll make you say \"Boom goes the dynamite!\"   The inside is very plainly decorated but that doesn't matter when your food tastes that good. Try it, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"So this place is always packed and I love me some L&L barbecue so we decided to try this.  Not so good :( the meat is super fatty and its just not as good as L&L Hawaiian BBQ at nor terra . Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"I went to this place based on the good reviews it received by fellow Yelpers and I was not disappointed!  I went during off dining hours and was worried that the food might be dry or not as fresh.  I ordered the chicken and kalua pork combo which comes with steamed cabbage, macaroni salad and rice.  Quite a bit of food for only $8!  It came out in a styrofoam box and was like a gift of goodness.  I opened up to find everything piping hot and very tender and juicy.  The chicken was delicious with a sweet teriyaki-ish flavor and the shredded pork was some of the most delicious I've ever had.  The macaroni salad, while simple, was very creamy and tasty.  The staff was extremely nice as well.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I love their island BBQ combo! Brought my family here while they were visiting from the east coast and they loved it too!"}
{"text":"Authentic and reasonably priced food. Quality is so good and we're never disappointed coming here! Love this spot. My fiancé and I order the mini BBQ beef plates."}
{"text":"We stopped by here because it was close to an appointment we had, and I love good Hawaiian BBQ.  We had the chicken combo, which was BBQ chicken, crispy chicken, white rice, a macaroni salad, and some greens.  The crispy chicken was kick-a**.  The BBQ was tasty, and unlike some places it was tender and not dry at all.  This is a small counter place, and we went at like 1:45 on a Friday.  There was a steady influx of people so only one or two tables were empty at a time, which is a great indicator of new place.  Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a huge meal on a budget, but not award winning food.  Food seemed to be precooked pressed lunch meat strips reheated and dipped in sauce. Place was clean and friendly."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! This is a cute little place for Hawaiian food, owned by some Chinese people! Not sure if it's \"authentic\" Hawaiian food, but definitely think it compares up to L&L or Ono Hawaiian food that other people usually go to (at least in LA area).   I actually thought their Kalua pork was ok, but their BBQ Chicken, Beef, and their Ribs were amazing!! Their mac & cheese didn't feel too oily like most other Hawaiian places do.   Best part is, I love that they have so many options for their musubi!! They have the typical spam musubi, and also have Chicken Katsu, BBQ Chicken, BBQ Beef, and I believe there's one more. They're also decently cheap comparing to other places!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  I like the chicken Katsu.  The BBQ chicken was also good. The ribs were not my favorite, but all in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Very Good Fast/casual Hawaiian Food just like what I had in Hawaii!  I am a regular because the food is always good and is always served piping hot and very fresh 100% of the time. Leo's Island BBQ one of the few family owned business in the Arrowhead Mall area.   One of my favorite Meals from Leo's Island BBQ is the Island Curry Chicken with potatoes, onions and Carrots in a Yellow Curry Sauce. This one is made with a very generous amount of white meat natural chicken that's always so moist and fresh, it's a pleasure to eat. I enjoy their House Made Curry Sauce it's made with exotic seasoning that's so tasty I crave it. They serve most of the plate meals over fresh steamed cabbage with a couple pieces of fresh steamed broccoli. You get a double scoop of steamed Rice (white or Brown(extra for brown) and a scoop of very fresh macaroni salad that I love with a squirt of Sriracha. Because the portion is so big I get two meals out of this and that's a Win!  Often I also get the Mahi Mahi Grilled Fish. It's always very fresh tasting and I like the crispy edges they get on the fish. Sometimes I get the Lemon Pepper Chicken or a noodle soup when I'm in the mood for something a little lighter.   My husband enjoys everything he tried here. He usually get a combo plate of BBQ Chicken and Kalua Pork and enjoys it every time. He enjoys other foods from here too like when he last got the shrimp he was very impressed that they cooked it perfect. He also likes the Moco Loco.  The food from Leo's Island BBQ is very solid and prices are low. You might just do a Hula!  4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"I really dig Leo's.  The place was clean. The food was fresh, and the servings were large.   My wife ordered the Katsu Chicken, and it was fresh, super crispy and hot. Some of the best Katsu I've had.  The BBQ chicken was moist, with a tasty marinade... super delicious.  Oh, and the serving size is/was really substantial, and a good value for the dollar.  We ended up going back here again - a week later, because it was so good. And again, everything was terrific."}
{"text":"Good not great but a good value. Little place with inexpensive food that's good. I had the BBQ combo which was decent. Meat, rice, and macaroni."}
{"text":"I went searching for some Hawaiian BBQ after my wife and I returned from our honeymoon in Kauai. This little spot was right under my nose at home in Peoria and I never knew it existed. I went back twice in the same week for the BBQ Chicken and Kalua Pork Combo. They know how to grill the chicken thighs just right so they are juicy and flavorful. The Kalua Pork was saltier than I remember from Hawaii, but still excellent. The combo was accompanied by steamed vegetables with a good amount of cabbage, steamed white rice, and macaroni salad. It was a large amount of food for one person. I can't wait to try their Fish Noodle Soup, Loco Moco breakfast, and Island Grilled fish."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, I have been here once so I don't know what I got. But I do remember I got the macaroni salad and it was the best. I crave it every time I pass by haha. I can't wait to go back again. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love Leo's even if Leo's doesn't love me very much.  The portions are extremely reasonable for the prices (which don't even get that out of hand for the larger entrees).   The Macaroni salad that they offer with all of their main entrees is delicious and compared to the stuff at the store is almost impossible to beat.  To be honest, I haven't had macaroni salad this good that wasn't homemade.    The staff is polite and the service is usually fairly quick.  The dining room isn't that large and whether you eat in or not, everything is packed in take out boxes, so Leo's doesn't have the best experience for dining-in but the dining room is usually quiet which is nice.   Besides their range of Hawaiian/Pacific food offerings, Leo's also has a selection of Hawaiian drinks available.  If you've never tried Hawaiian style food, Leo's is definitly a good place to try out.   The pineapple chicken is to die for."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and each time I'm amazed at how much I like the macaroni salad. I don't typically like macaroni salad but theirs is really good! It's not too mayonnaisey. I've had their chicken soup and the lemon pepper chicken, both of which are tasty! The chicken is always moist and flavorful. The soup was good and I liked everything in it, but it needed salt. Seriously my favorite thing here though is the macaroni salad. Prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp when I was craving Hawaiian food! Moved to Phoenix a few months ago and thought I would try it. (I was not expecting much) Wow! This is my new go to place for Hawaiian cuisine. It brought me back to the islands and really made my Saturday! I ordered the family meal. Pineapple chicken,  BBQ Katsu chicken, and the Kalua pork. You get a ton of food with this meal and there was plenty left over. Tasted just as good for lunch the next day!  I also couldn't pass up on the manapuas!   The staff was very polite and I enjoyed talking with them about the food and the Hawaiian lifestyle. If you haven't tried Hawaiian food. You should take a chance in this place for sure, or like we say in Hawaii....you like try! So Ono!   I would have given this place 5 stars but there were not any tiki torches or hula dancers.  lol!"}
{"text":"Only thing that keeps it from 5 stars is the wait time..Great fresh food but slow to get the order out. Great otherwise! :)"}
{"text":"Great place for a hawaiian plate lunch! Do they sell their macaroni salad by the quart???"}
{"text":"Leo's is the best! I was craving good Hawaiian foods (ok, Spam Musubi and the macaroni salad) from back home. Gave Leo's a try and WOW!  Excellent friendly customer service, food cooked to order, and fresh, portions are very generous.  DE-LISH! Leo's will be a regular on my list. Mahalo!"}
{"text":"The best chow around period! Whenever we visit Phoenix, this is a priority stop. Leo's, thanks for the experience man. Simply perfect."}
{"text":"Expecting better ... was disappointed.  There aren't many places to get Hawaiian BBQ, and I was curious when I came across Leo's Island Grill.  Especially after reading all the positive reviews.  I hate to say it but I was a little disappointed. I was  expecting better on my first visit to Leo's Island Grill.     Leo's Island Grill serves their meals on Styrofoam platters.  The large styrofoam platters come with your entre selection over cabbage, double scoop of rice, and macaroni salad. The portions are very generous enough for two.  My chicken was a bit stringy and a little on the fatty side. My lunch companion ordered the combo which mixed three meats, with rice and macaroni salad. All of the food was somewhat bland and to be honest somewhat flavorless.  The prices at Leo's Island Grill are extremely reasonable for the amount of food served. The staff is friendly and, the store is clean.  I guess you could do worse in a pinch."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night after seeing great reviews on yelp! The service was great, the food was wonderful, and the restaurant was very clean! No negative everything was outstanding! When we are on the west side of town we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As an ex-island boy I miss Hawaii. Eating Hawaiian style bbq brings back memories. Don't get to the West side much but needed some asian groceries so drove out and had to try Leo's.  Got here early but they don't open until 11. Had to kill time at Arrowhead mall which is not open either but got some mall walking in.  Got the Chicken and Rib combo. Felt that would give a good sampling of what they had.  First off only got two pieces of ribs and one had a huge bone in it :(. Flavor was good, not super salty like some I've had.  Just wish I had one more piece of ribs and less chicken.  Overall a lot of food though.   The rice I have a problem with. Short grain, which is good but dry and tasted like they didn't wash it that good. Miss clean tasting slightly stick rice. Macaroni salad was good though.   Onto the chicken. Two kinds, bbq and katsu style. Bbq chicken tasted good. Not too salty.   Katsu was very crispy and the katsu sauce was nicely sweet. I added sriracha cause that's how I roll!!  All of that meat was on a bed of veggies. I was pleasantly surprised that the veggies had broccoli Spears and a bit of carrot with the cabbage. Most places I've been to only serve cabbage so that was nice.   Overall would have been four stars if the rice was better."}
{"text":"Great little place to grab a quick and satisfying bite for lunch!   The staff was very pleasant, knew the menu well and recommended a very tasty BBQ chicken mini meal for me. I could hardly finish even the mini meal and it was only $5.00!   While waiting for my food, I was outside making an phone call and one of the employees kindly came outside to hand me my to-go order. They were fairly busy when I went in too.   I ordered extra veggies in place of the mac salad (it has tuna in it, not a fan of seafood) and everything was fresh and steaming hot when I brought it home.   Only downfall, most Hawaiian BBQ places I've been have fatty-chicken, and this place was no exception. I prefer a lean piece of meat but there wasn't so much fat that it ruined my meal. Still very good and great portions."}
{"text":"Truly the best Hawaiian BBQ in the city! I have been here more than a few times and have never been disappointed. Friendly staff coupled with delicious food delivers a consistent enjoyable experience each and every time. Oh and its quite affordable as well.  This place has won the best in Phoenix award a few times and the judges got it right. One day I would like to view their meat selection process person because they do an amazing job. ALL good cuts! I recommend you make the trip from wherever you are in the Maricopa area to this location. it is absolutely worth it.   They beef is perfectly seasoned. It has a slight sweet taste to it. And yet it retains the delicious mix of flavorings including subtle onion. It perfectly falls of the small amount of bones that it wraps around. Its very savory.   The BBQ chicken is perfect as well. Nicely cooked. Not too juicy and not too dry.   And of course the famous Mac salad. I don't usually like mac salad but this is the exception. Its perfect. Its light, not overbearing. And tastes amazing.   And of course their side sauces are custom made and perfect. They have spicy and sweet.   Check this place out. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to this location this week and was very upset on the quality of the food I received. I think I will not be returning soon I even got diarrhea ."}
{"text":"I've been to Hawaiian/Pacific Islander restaurants before in places that don't have a huge Hawaiian/Pacific Islander population. While it's been very good, I've always felt like they overcharged. This one was perfect.   The environment is fast casual. Everything was good. We shared the bbq platter, loco moco, and chicken curry katsu among 3 people. I particularly liked the short rib bbq among the bbq meats. I also really enjoyed the curry katsu. As someone who doesn't like a lot of curry, it was nice that the curry was on the side and I could control how much would be no there. And the best part- the chicken was not dry. I liked the loco moco, but there was nothing unique about it IMO.  tl;dr good price, fast casual, get the katsu chicken or the short rib. Even outside of those, everything is probably worth it."}
{"text":"I visited this location after getting my nails done and was pleasantly surprised. The kalua pork plate was delicious and reminded me of home in Hawaii.  It could have had more salt, but all around it was very tasty.  The macaroni salad was as it should be and the rice was perfect with the Aloha Shoyu provided!  The manapuas were smaller than I'm used to, but still tasty and the spam musubi was delicious as well.  I think this place is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Lemon pepper chicken bowl, you're my new love. Wow what flavor, I love lemon so if you do too this is a good choice. Tender chicken, fresh steamed veggies, rice. All for 6ish dollars. Score."}
{"text":"Great little spot right next to the Barnes and Noble I was at today. Got my food pretty quickly and it was cheap too. Not the best Hawaiian BBQ I've had but still a great place to fill up for a decent price."}
{"text":"It was one of those days we needed lunch (like 5 min ago) and we didn't want a sit down place, but didn't want a normal chain that we can get back home in the midwest, but also had to be delicious.  So my Yelp search gave us this place.  I don't have any real qualified experience with Hawaiian barbeque but between my husband's taste buds and my taste buds, we concluded this was decent food.  I got the BBQ chicken salad.  LOVED the sauce on the chicken and it was cooked really well and remained moist.  The salad itself and its toppings were nothing special, but I don't think I was expecting it to be at a place like this.  My husband got a combo chicken dish which had the BBQ chicken as well as the Katsu chicken.  We concluded the Katsu wasn't nearly as impressive as the BBQ version.  I'd swing through here again for sure if I needed something fast, well-priced, and delish."}
{"text":"Best lemon pepper chicken in the valley.  Why 5 stars 1. Clean. 2. Flavor. Flavor.flavor. 3. Portions are big. 4. Spam masubi made right!  masubi. 5. Price is cheap.  Overall i would give it 5 start over and ovee again.  also like how its just a small place, where everyone gets to know each other. did i mention about the flavor?  try it!"}
{"text":"Great place family run, very consistent with great food and great service. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"After reading about this place in Phx New Times, I thought I would try it out after work.  OMG!!!!  This food is better than several of the places where we ate in Hawaii!  We ordered the seafood soup, kalbi, chicken, and pork--and of course the Spam masubi.  Everything that I ate was delicious delicious delicious!!!!   The people taking orders were very friendly, the bathroom was clean, and the restaurant has lots of natural light.  So thankful that I was able to try this place!  Definitely better than Onos!!!   I will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Casual and clean, we felt like we were lunching in Hawaii!  Kaluha pork and teriaki bbq chicken   Luscious!!!  With nice mixed veggies, macaroni salad, and rice sides."}
{"text":"Since we can't get Hawaiian food till our next vacation to one of  islands, this place is great for the Phoenix area.  Much better than most of the other Hawaiian fast food places I have been to in the valley.    I got the Chicken Katsu curry and I found it very tasty and filling.  The Macaroni salad is decent.  Nothing to really talk about except that it is there and I ate it.  Price was good and food was quick."}
{"text":"Go. Eat. Here. This is one of the most delicious places I have ever been to. I went on a Sunday evening and ordered thelemon pepper chicken. It came with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad on the side. The chicken itself was juicy and well seasoned. There were actually 2 full cooked chicken breasts on a bed of steamed cabbage and broccoli. Just amazing. I also ordered spam musubi that was made fresh right then. They make everything fresh to order. The place is clean and the staff is nice as well. I'm definitely going to go back!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! but they need a better A/C system. We went in there during the summer and it was uncomfortable."}
{"text":"So thankful this place exists when I need some food from home. They dont have LauLau but they have mac salad and katsu that tastes like its from home :) A very comfortable plate lunch place, but cleanest I've seen. The staff always seems very helpful and friendly and do a great job getting your take out order prepared quickly. They even cut off the corner of your plate lunch lid if you order chicken katsu do it doesn't get soggy on the drive home. We have been here at least 4 times now and plan to keep returning :)"}
{"text":"This place truly makes my day great! Their combo of delicious Bbq meats and rice and macaroni salad with some steamed cabbage gives you so many flavors that you will for sure kick your feet out in satisfaction when you are done!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is fresh and delicious! The staff is extremely nice, they bring the food out to you and are always friendly with my niece. The prices are good. They give you a good sized meal for a low price.   I love the bbq beef and macaroni salad! So good!"}
{"text":"Leo's does a really decent plate lunch. As for the people complaining about certain dishes, it's more a matter of expectation, rather than execution.  My brother in law is from the big island Hawaii... pidgin and all (which I secretly love when he breaks in to, but will deny if he asks), so I have heard all the stories about plate lunches and the time he ate three in one setting, etc. He LOVES a plate lunch and he likes the ones here. I'm trusting that he knows of what he speaks.  Yes the macaroni salad is bland. That is how they make it there. It is basically a ton of mayo, macaroni, a smidge of grated onion, and usually a hint of tuna. Basically you get additional flavoring from the grilled meat or add it with a little shoyu. If that doesn't sound like what you are \"used\" to getting, you probably aren't going to like it. But I have to say all that mayonnaise makes my heart sing.  I personally love the BBQ chicken and the lemon pepper chicken. Mostly because they are on the healthier side. If you order the lemon pepper chicken with no rice or salad and extra cabbage, it's low-carb and low calorie, in addition to being really tasty.  The chicken katsu is also very good. Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. And my BIL likes the spam musubi. Well he likes any musubi actually. :)  Service is fast. The eating area is clean. The meals are cheap. And I actually like that there is no \"corporate office\" to complain to. If you want to eat at a chain, go somewhere else. This is family owned and operated.  I like Leo's. If you have a family, order the family dinner and pull up a chair, because you are going to be there a while. It's a lot of good food!"}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for this wonderful recommendation.  My husband and I no frequent Leo's at least once a month and have introduced my parents to their outstanding food.  The restaurant is immaculate and the people who work there are very friendly.  Most important though is the macaroni salad.  What is in there that makes me crave it?  I could eat a tub of the amazing salad.  For the Super Bowl we ordered 20 scoops and served it to our guests.  The young man always at the counter said he gets a lot of requests for tubs of the salad.  I have tried numerous meat dishes on the menu and all have been great.  Seriously...GO THERE!!"}
{"text":"A bit above the average for this kind of eatery. I usually don't eat at places like this but since I was dragged into it...."}
{"text":"The spam musubi is the best thing on the menu as far as I'm concerned - I haven't tried much else on the menu because I can't stray away from it.  Two pieces come as an appetizer but it's filling enough to eat as an entire meal, which I do.  The small place is always clean, service is fast, prices are cheap.  Not bad for being the only place around to find some Hawaiian(ish) food."}
{"text":"Great lunch special. $5 for a double scoop of rice (plain white) and a meat. They suggested the beef. It was all good cuts of meat no fat or gross stuff. The rice was well plain white rice.   The place is clean and they have some neat things on the menus. I will b back."}
{"text":"I just love the food here.  It's hot and fresh every time with generous portion sizes.  The people are friendly and restaurant is very clean.  I usually get the crispy shrimp and bbq chicken combo.  The shrimp is breaded and fried perfectly, not greasy at all.  The chicken is tender and nicely seasoned.  They use thigh meat for the chicken bbq.  Now normally I HATE dark meat, but they do theirs so well that I crave the stuff.  I like dipping the shrimp in their teriyaki sauce...and just like dark meat, I normally HATE teriyaki sauce, but the sauce at Leo's is just so tasty.  It's still surprising to me that I keep going back there to get two food items that I used to hate, but there you go.  :)  I'm also a big fan of their macaroni salad.  It's mayonaisey goodness and so creamy.  I see some reviewers aren't fans.  I guess either you like that type of salad or you don't.  I think it's awesome.  They also have good egg rolls (that I love dipping in that teriyaki sauce) and spam musubi.  I keep meaning to try more of their menu, but I keep coming back to the shrimp and chicken plate.  My husband is a fan of their burgers.    This is one of my west valley favorites.  I hope they're around for long, long time.  4 stars."}
{"text":"Great food, great price, great staff, great restaurant............nothing else to say.  All I could ask is if they could move their establishment closer to my house.  The positive reviews of this place are well deserved.  The food tasted great and with a price around $8 and entrée, you could not ask for more. The portions are also very large. The staff were very eager to help and I do not think I ever saw them sit still. Every time I glanced their way, they were either helping customers or cleaning. No joke, this place was spotless. That speaks volumes about the management of this joint and I left being very impressed. Our new go to spot when looking for a quick bite to eat when in the Arrowhead area."}
{"text":"Very delicious and generous portion of food.  Served up nice and hot to your table.  Friendly customer service.  Very affordable."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to my experience at Leo's Island. Unfortunately, while it wasn't terrible, it was certainly nothing great. I had the Island BBQ mix and it was nothing to write home about. Everything had kind of a bland taste. The teriyaki sauce was just average and the beef was a little overcooked. Service was a little slow especially for a midweek lunch at 2:30pm.   I'm a huge fan of Hawaiian BBQ and have dined at several joints in Arizona, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for good authentic Hawaiian food. So far, the best spots I have found have been located in the East Valley."}
{"text":"This has become a regular lunch spot for me. The chicken combo has been the only dish I've ever ordered here, and it's consistency of great flavor and freshness always satisfies. I consider this a step up from ONO's Hawaiian for sure."}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new and this place did not disappoint.  The portions are generous and staff is very polite.  The food was tender and very tasty.  I would recommend again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Large portions makes it a great value! Very clean and all employees were extremely friendly."}
{"text":"The best the best the best!  Everything from their macaroni salad to their Kalbi ribs are amazing.   Huge portions, and did I mention the macaroni salad? You might look at it and say what's the big deal, it's just macaroni with some shredded carrots and mayonnaise?  Mix in a little kahlua pork and some steamed cabbage and you'll see.  I was a regular, but sadly I moved away. It's always my first stop when I get back to Phoenix.  I always get the BBQ combo; grilled chicken, beef macaroni salad, rice and steamed vegetables. A+."}
{"text":"Group of 8 met here before a game and all were pleased with the choices and tasty food. Lemon pepper chicken was soy free for those avoiding gluten. Everything was prepared to order in about 10 minutes and served hot. Self serve beverages had fresh lemon available. Macaroni salad came with Meals - just like in Hawaii!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try Leo's because of the reviews, however I was very disappointed. The food is bland and nothing special. I'm still waiting on a decent BBQ place in the west valley."}
{"text":"Chicken katsu with curry sauce is the best, along with the short ribs. This place is the real deal stick to your ribs Hawaiian comfort food. Don't be afraid that it cones with rice and macaroni salad, just say thanks!"}
{"text":"The lemon pepper chicken is very moist and good eith the vegetables, the katsu chicken us crunchy on the outside yet tender on the inside, must pair with the katsu sauce of course! Spam musubi was great! No component too strong, nice balance flavor. Goes nice with teriyaki, katsu, or soy sauce.  I definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The food is wonderful, but the customer service surpasses even that. I go to Leo's once or twice a month, and they always remember my face and favorite order when i walk in the door.    My favorite experience at Leo's is from the time I rolled in there 10 mins before they closed after pulling a 12 hour day at work. I had left my wallet at home that day, and only had my license and my AmEx in my pocket. Unfortunately, Leo's doesn't take AmEx, but that did not stop me from getting a warm dinner in my belly that night. They let me walk out the door with my BBQ mix plate and spam musubi with a promise to pay next time I stopped in! That type of service and generosity is rare in the food industry! (Suffice to say, I stopped in the next day and settled that bill with some cash!)  I highly recommend getting one of the lunch mix plates your first time in, to get a sampling of truly authentic Hawaiian food. After that, feel free to experiment around with the different rice and noodle bowls on offer. The spam musubi is my favorite item on the menu, and I usually order that, with crab rangoon and a side of macaroni salad if I don't have the appetite for a full plate.  This place is ALWAYS busy, but they get the food out fast and with a smile."}
{"text":"Very good food with lots of it. Quasi Japanese tasting (we lived in Japan) and since we've never been to Hawaii I assume that's how Hawaiian food tastes. The Curry Katsu Chicken is AMAZING. You get macaroni salad with everything and I've been told that is common. It is very tasty. Very. The service is fast and you get a large portion. The beef ribs are excellent."}
{"text":"Stopped at Leo's for the first time. Reminded me of L&L haha it was great. Everyone there was friendly and the food was great!! I had the BBQ mix combo. The meat was tender and super tasty. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out based on the reviews. It was totally worth it! The food was delicious and hot. The staff was very nice and friendly. The portions are amazing and so is the price. If you want some yummy plate lunches this is the place!"}
{"text":"I eat here almost weekly. Always order the Teriyaki chicken. It comes with rice, macaroni salad, and vegetables at the bottom of your meats. Macaroni Salad is to die for, and the chicken has soo much flavor.   I will definitely recommend for those who live in the area to visit."}
{"text":"Awesome food would go back and back and back.  Great Hawaiian menu and a great family meal deal that would feed an army....."}
{"text":"Giving you macaroni salad with every order is such a Polynesian power move. It's genius AND delicious.   Leo's is about $8/person but they give you two meals worth of food. Brilliant and sauces galore. That's all I want in life."}
{"text":"Phoenix has very few good island spots to eat, and this place is one of them. Real island food is pretty salty most of the times, but this place (run by chinese i think) found a good balance between salty and delish. It's not salty, but it's not flavorless either, its a good balance.  I would come back here again one day to enjoy the food.  Place is clean, food is good, and customer service was great!"}
{"text":"I tried this place because I like support smaller businesses and saw it had good reviews. I didn't like the chicken, or the rice. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"This review is only for grill beef. Texture is very weird,  they probably use too much baking soda ( as tenderizer). you can taste heavy sugar and soy sauce but not much beef flavor.  The price is too high for fast food lunch,   $10 a plate, i can have 3 In-And-Out burger, which you can taste natural beef flavor.  But inside this fast food restaurant, ii is clean and bright, not a bad place to meet friend. If i have to go back for social gathering, I'll try other dish and update this review."}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to try this place and so we did. I got the orange chicken plate it came with rice and macaroni salad. It wasn't your ordinary orange chicken. The chicken pieces looked like tenders and the sauce was on the side. I mean don't get me wrong the chicken was fresh and amazing but It didn't earn up to the orange chicken title. I didn't see how the macaroni was blending in with the theme of my platter. It was just odd! Wasn't really crazy about the food the only thing I liked was that it was fresh!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and really enjoyed it.   We were in Hawaii a few weeks ago and kind of fell in love with what we think is the weirdest cuisine out there.....and Leo's nailed it. It's very authentic, fresh and cheap. It was great.   We had the bbq mix plate, chicken curry plate, and teriyaki masubis. All that food was $22 and we have plenty to take home."}
{"text":"Not good... People must go here for the price/quanity over quality.  Low quality chicken and beef with a good sauce doesnt make it taste good.  Skippable."}
{"text":"I loooove this place!   Positives: Hubby and I stopped in here and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I got the chicken curry dish and it was AMAZING!! (I wish I had some right about now) I would recommend giving this special dish a try!!  Hubby got the beef and loved it as well. I love this macaroni salad. A little too much I believe I ate a double order. Hahaha  Negatives: It's located out by Arrowhead and I'm in Goodyear."}
{"text":"We have been going to Leo's for years. The food is always fresh and delicious. The restaurant is always very clean and the staff are friendly. I recommended the orange chicken!"}
{"text":"Love love love their BBQ chicken, BBQ beef, spam musubi and ribs. Omg. My fave cravings.  I can't have enough. Reminds me of my Hawaiian trips. Ah good good and good memories  Their lemon pepper chicken however is bland and plain so I never get it anymore. It definitely needs more sauce or some type of improvement. And I never tried their seafood. So not sure about that either."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is a little pricier (~$10) than you would see at some of the local restaurants nearby but it is WAY fucking better and you get a lot for food.   They have combos that include a macaroni salad, cabbage and a sticky white rice.   Always clean Always friendly Always crazy good  Skip Denny's and Applebees and come here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite food places in Glendale! The food here is addictingly delicious, the portions generous, and the prices fair. Try their spam masubi!"}
{"text":"As a regular of L&L BBQ in San Bruno, all I can say is, HOLY SHIT. But in a good way. Maybe it's because it's family owned, or that it was a good batch of chicken, or that I hadn't eaten all day, but that was the best BBQ chicken combo I've had. Ever.   Thinking back, it was probably because I was hungry as hell. But 5 stars until I come back and find out otherwise."}
{"text":"Get the mixed bbq plate; chicken, beef and short ribs. All the meats were tender and the sauces weren't too thick. It's basically Chinese food, but with Hawaiian recipes."}
{"text":"Chicken katsu is the bomb!!! It's enough for lunch and dinner! And it's under $7! Took off a star cuz I think they are not operated by the real islanders..."}
{"text":"It was our first time there & we were pleasantly surprised that our neighborhood spot was so healthy & delicious!!!! I highly recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"I was thoroughly surprised and pleased with the quality of Leo's. There is one particular chain of Hawaiian BBQ places (which will remain unnamed) that I absolutely love but they have too few locations for me to enjoy them often. I have tried other Island BBQ places in hopes of finding a substitute, but have always come out horribly disappointed...until now.  Leo's not only exceeded my expectations, but I believe their food is even better than that of the aforementioned chain which I love so much.  Leo's deserves a look. Even if it's something new for you, give it a shot. The katsu sauce is outstanding and their macaroni salad with a little soy sauce on it is out of this world."}
{"text":"Always love coming here for the great food, great family atmosphere and the wonderful staff. Been coming here since they opened their doors. Way better food and especially prices than L&L or Ono Hawaiian. My kids eat up the musubi (spam, rice, nori) and the Mac salad is ohh so good. I always bring family here when they are in town for some good island food. If you know a good easy recipe, just ask them and they just might add it to the menu. I keep meaning to get them the recipe for lau lau and crispy gau gee but I keep forgetting to bring it in. My favorite is the Katsu, curry, and ribs (so good). Take homes include musubi, Mac salad, and my daughter's favorite is egg drop soup (you have to ask special for this item)."}
{"text":"Their macaroni salad and kalua pork is to die for! Whenever I crave Hawaiian food, this is the place I hit up. I've also tried the BBQ chicken which is good here. Their guava drink in addition is delicious"}
{"text":"I completely agree with Ray T's review. This is Ono Hawaiian BBQ with a different name. I was pretty disappointed. The shrimp and chicken katsu tasted previously frozen. Mac salad was good. BBQ chicken was good. Manapua not so good (they were small compared to a normal sized bao and I didn't like the sauce flavor, too sweet or something). We also waited 20 mins for our food.  I've had vastly better plate lunch in the valley. And if you have Ono's near you, no need to make the drive out here for this. Same stuff. Same quality. I'm seriously baffled as to how they won a Best of Phoenix award."}
{"text":"Craving Hawaiian BBQ. Can't go wrong here. It's delicious in the tummy! I got the #7 chicken combo. Bbq chicken with katsu chicken. No cabbage extra macaroni Mmmmm."}
{"text":"We did not know what to expect when we came here. We were very impressed with the service and with the food. Is a small place. I ordered the barbecue beef and then found out rice and a macaroni salad came with it. The beef was nice and tender, the sauce was really good and the macaroni salad was fantastic. My husband went with a hamburger and said it was one of the better hamburger sandwiches he has had. We are sorry we have not found this place sooner and plan to go back again."}
{"text":"Tastes artificial and microwaved almost, clearly not really microwaved but the consistency and flavor of that.  Definitely not a place I would ever consider returning to."}
{"text":"I would have gave it 5 stars if staff was at all welcoming. The food was fresh and great. The Katsu sauce is a must have! I got the beef and rib plate and every bite was delicious. Only thing missing was a greeting hello and thank you when you arrive."}
{"text":"This place was much better than Ono's and well worth the drive. The Spam musubi is awesome. The mixed plate is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I ordered the seafood mix plate (fried shrimp, fried fish, BBQ chicken). I asked for french fries instead of the macaroni salad, I was charged $1 more. The fries were crinkle cut and saturated with oil, they were gross. The shrimp and fish were ok, and the rice too. The chicken was terrible, it was tough and stringy and I just wanted to stop eating it. I would never get that again, or recommend it. The place was clean and the service friendly."}
{"text":"I love this place! I usually get the $5 mini meal. It's sooo good and fills me up! I usually get the Island Teriyaki, but I've tried the beef teriyaki and chicken katsu and they are all very good. I love their teriyaki sauce and their macaroni salad is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was ssooooooooo good. I'm serious. I've had a couple of other Hawaiian places - probably ones you've tried if you're here in Phoenix - but this place topped them all. Most of the places I tried were like super greasy and the meat is dried out.   I got their Katsu chicken meal. The chicken was crispy but not dry. Their crab rangoons were actually STUFFED to the brim, instead of being mostly crust. Their macaroni was creamy but not overly so. And, because customers requested it, they actually serve fried rice as well.   I've driven past the place dozens of times and thought about stopping but never did. I'm glad I finally went it and tried it."}
{"text":"If your looking for something chewier than beef jerky then try the short ribs. Jerky has more flavor but I think I lost weight trying to put this meal down.   The BBQ Chicken (chicken like product?) was so processed it was flavorless and texture free.   The other meat product that came on the #8 special was the toughest of all.   Now take all of these items and drown them in a sugar based sauce and you've got a real desperate mans treat.   Avoid this place!"}
{"text":"This place was nice and clean, smelled great. I had the Island BBQ Mix and my niece had the Chicken Katsu. I asked to replace the rice with macaroni salad, as you can never have enough of that. It was all excellent. The cashier (who also brought the food to our table), was friendly, helpful and sweet. We will go back for more!"}
{"text":"Visiting Arizona for the first time. Low & behold I found this local eatery that reminds me of home...in Hawai'i. Wow, all I can say is that food was ONO!! For all the non-hawaiians its a slang like \"taste good\". The hawaiian music, made me feel right at home in the islands. The Island BBQ Mix was awesome & the price for that size of a plate, doesnt compare.   Iz da winnahz in my book!! Mahalo to the owners, well done"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian food in AZ, hands down. My wife and I moved to Tempe, and still make the drive to come here.   Now with that being said, here's the deal.  There must be 2 different cooks, because 95% of the time the food is perfect. Very few times (tonight being one of them) the meat is mostly fat, Grissel, and cartilage. It makes me very sad because I drive so far just to eat here.   I can see how people give this place negative reviews if they eat here with the bad cook. But please come back on a different day and give them another try.   Still giving them 5 stars because when the food is good, it's perfect."}
{"text":"OMG the food at this place brought back memories of Hawaii! I had Katsu Chicken, BBQ chicken, and beef short ribs with brown rice and veggies. It was so fresh and delicious! Not eveyone gets Katsu Chicken right, theirs was so crunchy on the outside, and tender and juicy on the inside. I was practically drooling! Everything was great! My son loved his chicken teriyaki bowl as well! I'm hoping to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"For what it is it's very good. Simple, cheap, Hawaiian style food. They don't overcook the meat. The chicken has a nice flavor and the short ribs are grilled to perfection. My wife and I split the seafood combo and it's plenty of food for us. One of the best little joints in the 85308 area!"}
{"text":"Consistently great! Pleasant staff, fast preparation, decent prices, and delicious food. Even if you've never had Island food before you will enjoy this place. Try the Chicken Combo if you are new to this cuisine. I agree with Tammy T, I'd go back for their macaroni salad."}
{"text":"Leo's has amazing Hawaiian food!!! My Pops is from Honolulu and I grew up on macaroni salad and Spam  I got the Kahlua Pork and Cabbage and Spam Musubi. The pork was so tender and flavorful, the cabbage was perfectly cooked, the rice was amazing and the macaroni salad was delicious. The portion was HUGE... I could barely finish half of it (and let me tell you this chick can eat). The Spam Musubi was also incredible! The Spam was perfectly cooked! The prices here are very reasonable and the staff treat you like ohana. Leave the mainland for a while and go to Leo's for a delicious Hawaiian meal!"}
{"text":"The flavor of the food is absolutely amazing! The portions are more than plenty and the prices aren't that bad. I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"Delicious macaroni! This place reminds me of L&L, similar menu, same presentation of food in the box. They try and skimp you with the meat by putting rice underneath it, so be sure to tell them you don't want rice under the meat if you do order something like that. The staff can be in their own world sometimes, but its cool. We all have our days. I haven't ventured away from the teriyaki bbq, but one day I will and I'm sure it will be just as tasty."}
{"text":"I got the Kalua pork, Katsu chicken, and bbq chicken. They are all fantastic. The macaroni salad is also super good. They had my food out in about 5 minutes and the staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"Hooray!!!! I found another Hawaiian restaurant that I like!   OK. Many moons ago, I lived by an Ono. Many moons later, I moved away, but I would drive past one on my long commute. Then I moved right near my work and no more Ono. So then I see I lived near an L&L. I can once again be happy, right??? WRONG! L&L suuuuuuucccccked. So I just gave up on my Hawaiian food love affair.   Fast forward to this evening. I had to quell my craving. So I see what the next nearest place is, and here I land.   The place was very busy when I came in, but the wait was not long. I'm a big beefy sumbich and I know what I like, and what o like is a BBQ mix with all Mac. Sure as shiitake, they have it! Ordered, sat, and waited. Food took a reasonable amount of time. They brought it to me.   Now I'm a sauce loving mofo, and their teriyaki is the thick kind that I like. They also have katsu. They come in cups, but they are not the lil tiny cups, they are the next size up. Sweet! Got 2 of each. The sauces were great! Not too salty. Sometimes that gets messed up at other places.   The meats were great and reasonably portioned, based on my experience. The Mac was yummy too! I'm looking forward to coming back soon.  Do be warned, they are busy and they don't have a large dining area. They may not have a place to sit if you come when they are busy."}
{"text":"I had the BBQ sampler for lunch, which contains BBQ chicken and BBQ beef. The beef had a great taste but was a bit tough. The chicken reminded me of the chicken you get at a Chinese buffet. Not so good. The rice and mac sides were ho hum. If I was back in town and ate here again, I would go for the BBQ beef and maybe try the fish and shrimp."}
{"text":"Good A1 that rice doe on point chicken is always fire had me weak to me knees soo good basically whenever I get my paycheck I eat good thanks to this place lol"}
{"text":"Staff is amazing and will always go out of their way to recommend different dishes. Portions are huge for the price and everything always tastes fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"First time coming here yesterday and I was hooked! The staff was friendly and accommodating, food was reasonably priced and the portioning was generous! It was also deliciously seasoned and the meat is cooked just right - not hard nor chewy! My only concern about this place is the space is very limited. I hope one day they expand and become like a family restaurant style! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the last 5 years and Is still by far the best Hawaiian BBQ place in the whole west valley! The food takes a little bit to come out but is fresh every single time! Try the BBQ beef as well as the spam musubi!"}
{"text":"Called this place after reading the reviews and wanting to try it out , I specifically called to ask the lady what time they closed today and she said 9pm. We arrived around 828PM for pickup and they said they were closed. Great, we drove all the way over here for nothing! Guess we will be sticking to Ono."}
{"text":"Aside from shave ice, I know absolutely nothing about Hawaiian food. And if this place is as legit as people claim, then I'd imagine it's some kind of fusion between a lot of different cultures, notably of Asian variants.   I ordered the BBQ Mix, which comes with three different meats, including BBQ pork, chicken, and ribs. My girlfriend ordered the chicken combo, that included the BBQ chicken and chicken katsu - which is breaded. The meals come with rice and mac salad. I decided to upgrade mine to egg fried.  Now, this is a tricky review to write, because I honestly have nothing to compare it against. I can confidently say that the meats were all very good quality, sans the beef being just a tad too fatty for my taste. My girlfriend and I both agreed that the BBQ chicken was the best, which is not what I expected. Rice was standard, while mac salad has never really been my thing, personally.  The service was good and the place was both clean and crowded. Contrary to what I assumed after passing by dozens of times, this is a locally owned establishment that I'm glad to see thriving amongst a sea of subpar chain establishments.  Eventually, I might go back and experiment with their other dishes. My rating hovers somewhere in the 3 to 4-star range - but that's simply because this isn't really the kind of food that I eat regularly. But don't let that deter you. Most people are clearly very pleased.  Try them out!"}
{"text":"Excellent little place away from the really busy areas around Arrowhead. There is quite a variety in the menu, certainly with something for everyone. I had the chicken combo which was excellent and reasonably priced. Around $8.50. My wife ordered the crispy shrimp which was equally good and priced.  Next time though, unless we're REALLY hungry, we'll split a meal. The combos include steamed veggies, a scoop of macaroni salad and TWO scoops of rice.  The food is fresh and fast, the people are really friendly and the place is clean."}
{"text":"So so so so yummy!  Great service, and it is so much food.  Enough for 2 meals. You wait for a bit but they make everything fresh when ordered.   I always get the chicken katsu, my husband gets the mixed BBQ and then we share.  We have been to Kauai several times and it is highly comparable.   So excited they are only a mile away too!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with LEO's Island BBQ. This place is always extremely busy, and that is always a GOOD sign. Lots of favorable options for anyones taste buds. We usually get our food to go, and its still fresh by the time we get home."}
{"text":"Leo's opened up on Bell and 75th not too long ago and I've got to admit, I was pretty reluctant to give it a try. The closest decent Hawaiian BBQ joint can be found in Happy Valley off the 17th, which is quite a drive for students like me who go to school up the street aways.  Upon entering, you'll see a teenage boy at the register, his mom wiping down the tables, and his dad cooking in the back (all safe assumptions- they look alike). They all will gladly welcome you as if you just walked into their house for a New Year's party; it's quite adorable really.  On to the food- I got the BBQ chicken small plate while my friend got the Loco Moco, $5 + $7.50 + $2 Hawaiian drinks. Prices are decent. You pay, and they bring you the food once you sit. Takes about 5-10 min; you can see the dad make your food. Both dishes come with a scoop (or 2) of rice and a scoop of macaroni salad. The chicken was cooked well; it wasn't oily and was a good amount of tender. It's fresh and filling.   I'll stop by again to give their other menu options a try. It's good to support local business and I hope this one makes it!"}
{"text":"Incredible mac salad. Spam musubi. Curry... yum.   If you're looking for Hawaiian food, this is your spot."}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot more based on the reviews. It was fine. Not worth the 20 minute drive. The ribs had fat and gristle. The katsu chicken was bland but I have never been that jazzed by katsu anyway. The island fried fish was all breading. I did like the crab Rangoon and the fried shrimp."}
{"text":"Ordered the Maui pineapple chicken and it was a bit disgusting. One, the chicken was fried like katsu. The only thing that made it pineapple is the side sauce they give you in a container. The vegetables were steamed all the way which made it tasteless. The Mac salad was made with too much mayo. In the end, I wouldn't come here again."}
{"text":"If Hawaiian food is what you crave, Leo's is THE place to go!  I've been to the islands and can honestly say, this is as good as it gets!!!  You cant go wrong with anything on their menu.  However if your new to Hawaiian I'd recommend trying either the Kalua pork, or the chicken Katsu.  All meals come with 2 scoops of steamed white rice, steamed cabbage, and macaroni salad.  In terms of price...my wife and I had the above mentioned meals along with 2 drinks.  The total came in UNDER $19!!!  You just can't go wrong at Leo's!!!  Well maybe you can, but it will cost you a hell of a lot more, and you'll need 6 hours to fly there!"}
{"text":"Wish I could write more about this place but plain and simple this place is delicious!!! Simple food with amazing flavor! Great portions, great price and friendly service! What more can you ask for!"}
{"text":"I really love eating at Leo's it was my first time doing catering- my vision of small party platters is a lot different then what i expected! $75- seems crazy for the price I was in shock at the amount! But will I do catering again from Leo's most likely No- great place for for an individual meal but I wouldn't say it's a great deal on Catering! Food is GREAT! I worked at L-n-L on kauai for 4 years and came out to Phx and tried L-n-L Leo's food is so much!! But catering prices are really crazy!"}
{"text":"Top notch Island food.  Great value for the price and the servings are huge. Friendly and helpful staff as well"}
{"text":"My first visit here. My companion had the \"Island BBQ Mix\". - BBQ beef and chicken- and I had kalua pork and cabbage. Both were excellent. You have to ask for chopsticks"}
{"text":"This place fufills my Hawaii withdrawls. Its as close as you're going to get to authentic Hawaiian food! The employees are always so nice and friendly too!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in the area. The food is amazing. You can't really beat it. Also the macaroni salad is to die for. If you're in the area, definitely drop by, it's worth a try and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My best friend took me here, I had never tried it before and I fell in love! The chicken was savory and I just couldn't get enough of their macaroni salad! The place was clean and not crowded at all!  It's cheap but the food is Delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Leo's. my favorite place for Hawaiian food in the west valley. I used to go to L&L but I feel that Leo's is more fresh and authentic. I've been here at least 5 times and always get the Kailua pig and katsu chicken. I don't like Mac so I order double rice. What a meal! Usually enough for my wife and I to share. I like the family owned atmosphere here too so I will continue to support this place. Try it!!"}
{"text":"The chicken teriyaki was flavorful and oh so good. My husband had a bbq chicken salad. He loved it. We stopped by here on a whim as everything else was closed. Glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"food great, menu perfect, the sauce is not extra like some places have. when dining in, only annoying thing is theres no napkins whatsoever until they bring you your food. so when soda ran down my hand at the soda machine i couldnt find anything to wipe off with had to run to the restroom for paper towel-- what if someone was in there"}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable servings of Hawaiian style BBQ. I haven't varied much from the traditional chicken, beef and pork offerings because they're too good to pass up. Much better value than Ono."}
{"text":"Wow! good food! I'm happy to finally get to try it. Nice clean place and Buddha statue is greeting you. The garlic and shrimp is very good and so is the Mac and cheese.and happy to have steamed   broccoli  and carrots and cabbage. Will definitely be back to try other things"}
{"text":"This food was fantabulous.  The portions for the lunch plate are huge.  Two ppl could share it.  Their curry sauce is very good.   Good amount of spice, has chunks of potatoes in it, and is thickened just enough to keep it on the chicken when you dunk it in.  We will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"since yelp wants to take down my review of this place.  Ok so basically I have eaten here one time and ONE time only I will never return. The food was pretty DECENT, I will give them that. I went here with my mother and my son, and the ENTIRE time they watched us eat. I felt SO uncomfortable, they had given us a couple of paper plates that we ended up not using; but used them to put trash on and some used napkins. After staring at us for a good 20 min, they \"the employees behind the counter\" came to our table and asked us in a rude manner if we were using the paper plates? I thought maybe they were coming to clean up the table......NO they took these paper plates to reuse them, we watched them put them back in the stack of plates. If that wasn't bad enough, my son being in highchair and being a baby is gonna drop some food on the floor; before I could even pick up his food off the floor with my napkin \"which let me remind you these are the same used napkins that were on the paper plates they rudely asked for back\". Here comes an employee to give me a dirty look as she tried to clean up the little piece of macaroni that fell on the floor. The 20-30 min we spent here was awful, they stared at us the entire time and watched us eat. After they took our plates back to use them because we weren't using them we didn't even finish our food and quickly left. NEVER WASTING MY TIME OR MONEY HERE AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Every single time we go there it is an awesome experience. The people are nice and the food is great. We can easily feed a family of four for about 25 dollars. The plates are really generous. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place several times now, keep thinking it will get better, but it does not.  Mediocre food and that is being kind.  Next time I need to read my own review, and not go."}
{"text":"I am very excited about this place. Hands down best Hawaiian BBQ in AZ! Ever since I visited my mom in Hawaii and had plate lunch (called mini plate at Leo's) I have been CRAVING it. This is a gem for sure! Meat in AZ doesn't taste right at most eating establishments but Leo's was fresh and heavenly tasting. The restaurant was clean and the service was fantastic!! It's not fast food perfection takes time and this place is beyond PERFECT! I will drive from Cave Creek anytime I get the craving for authentic Hawaiian BBQ"}
{"text":"Great food, large portions and reasonably priced. Found it on a Yelp search, and was not disappointed. Had the short ribs and have to say some of the best I've ever had. Very meaty, hardly any fat at all, well seasoned and delicious. The restaurant was very clean, the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"The bomb! Enough said. Try this place or you are missing out! Try the BBQ short ribs, the noodle soups are great. And very hearty portions!"}
{"text":"NOM NOM NOM! I wanted bbq/hawaiian food while visiting AZ so the bf took me to Leo's, I got the chicken combo which comes with teriyaki chicken, katsu with rice and macaroni salad with a generous amount of veggies. It was really delicious! The katsu was deep fried perfectly. Not too dry and the meat is still juicy on the inside. The teriyaki was more towards the sweeter side but still very good.   The restaurant is located in a small plaza across from the plaza that Barnes and Noble sit in. Our GPS had some problems getting here. Kept looping us around but luckily, we found it.   The owners/employees are very nice and the restaurant is well kept and clean. I wish i had more time to try the other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Crackaroni salad gets 5 stars.  Give me a bucket of it, a spoon and leave me alone!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to stop by before a game at the Peoria Sports Complex. It's really closeby so it was convenient for us.   Food was fairly priced and portions were pretty big. The galbi was just ok... didn't think it had enough meat on the bone. However, the teriyaki beef was really good! I think that was my favorite from the island mix combo."}
{"text":"Food was good, serving sizes were plenty to fill me up, and the vegetables were importantly NOT SOGGY!  Staff was cordial and service was quickly managed.  The only knock I have is that there was not enough seating inside for the lunch crowd, and outside was less than inviting for those who would've had to chose between sweaty patio or sweaty car.    On their way in, one of the four armed services men asked me what plate I had ordered.  Obviously, it looked really good, and I want to re-state that the food was REALLY GOOD!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this establishment.  I tried the lemon pepper chicken and loved it.  It was nice and tender and very easy to chew.  The macaroni salad was also great.  I will definitely come back to this place to get my lemon pepper fix.  It wasn't over powering with lemon flavor like I've had a other places, which made it even more tasty."}
{"text":"I've tried the Shrimp & the BBQ beef ~ both are legit! The rice & macaroni salad are perfect sides, but don't forget the teriyaki dipping sauce! (The crab rangoons are good but the sweet & sour dipping sauce for them isn't)"}
{"text":"-ALOHA!!! If you crave the creamy taste of authentic macaroni salad from Hawaii, look no further...yum, yum, yum!  -Kalua pork was tender, smokey, and moist...yum! yum! yum!  -Grilled BBQ chicken was tender and so good!...yum! yum! yum!  -The noodle soup was so good - $5.99 and the portions are very generous!  -Crispy shrimp was crispy, maybe panko breading? It was so good! Not greasy! Perfectly cooked. Must have more!  -They even have SPAM on the menu too (if you've been to Hawaii, then you know that SPAM is offered everywhere - even at McD's too!)  -Service - FRIENDLY, SUPER NICE, and very cordial.   -Order your food at the counter and wait for your number to be called, or they bring it to your table on a tray. Fantastic service!  -The PORTIONS are VERY GENEROUS!!! Two people could easily share one combo plate...unless you are a very BIG eater. Two scoops of sticky rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and sauteed cabbage come with your meal.  -They do offer a rice bowl with choice of meat for $4.99 if you want a smaller meal.  -CLEAN place!!! Clean restroom!  -Parking is very convenient. Leo's is located across the parking lot from Barnes & Nobles and next to Baskin Robbins.  -Mahalo!"}
{"text":"The food was a little bland, and just ok. Everything seemed a little overcooked and dried out."}
{"text":"Not the worst place to eat but nothing special either. Got the BBQ chicken today but it looked nothing like the picture, which showed chunks of crispy chicken.  What I got was soggy and bland - I even had to ask to make sure I got the BBQ. If I come back, I'll have to try the Spam... Grilled Spam Moco, Spam Musubi, or Spam Burger. Mmmm!"}
{"text":"Best Hawaiian around. Generous portions for a good price. Best place to come after a long night of drinking. My favorite is the chicken combo with grilled chicken and chicken katsu. Love their katsu sauce and the macaroni salad. Come try it you won't be disappointed. I never have."}
{"text":"Solid food and good value. Not sure I agree with \"Best Hawaiian Food\" though--does not transport me back to my days on the Islands. Kalua pork was tasty but a little dry. Their veggies and egg rolls are super tasty. Chicken teriyaki was good but not necessarily better than any other Hawaiian joint. However, Leo's is super convenient to my current location. My previous go-to place that takes me back to the Islands is now 30+ min away and closed on Sun."}
{"text":"Food is delicious, with big portions at a good price. Takes long enough for you to know they are cooking fresh but isn't slow. Great spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service EVERY time we have eaten @Leo's.  Staff is always super friendly and helpful and actually make you feel like family. Always upbeat and smiling. Been eating there for 2years and always enjoy it! Close your eyes and pick out anything ! It WILL be good !"}
{"text":"I love so many things on the menu.  Oh and THAT noodle salad! Holy smokes, I always get 2 sides of it! Entire menu is excellent, just seems everytime I go, theres an issue with the ice tea."}
{"text":"Delicious! My first time here, and I got the BBQ mix. The meat is phenomenal in flavor. The beef is a little on the tougher side, but the flavor outweighs it. The chicken is really tender and favorable. The macaroni salad is decent and light in flavor (which I like). The portions are great and the price is reasonable. I will be back!  UPDATE: I realized that every time we eat their food, my husband and I get a bad headache. I'm not sure why. I called and asked if they used MSG, and they said NO. So, maybe there's a different ingredient they use that our body doesn't like."}
{"text":"Oh dear lord, the mac salad! I love this place. My usual is curry chicken katsu. The katsu stays deliciously crispy even when driven home after ordering it for takeout. The curry is divine. I simply don't have words for the mac salad, but I do tend to like things coated in mayo, so use that information as you will. Such great prices for such huge portions! I'm new to the area, but this is my favorite restaurant so far!  Thumbs up, Leo's!"}
{"text":"Super super tasty. I don't eat hawaiian bbq often, but these guys do it right, And how can you beat those lunch special prices! MMMM! I am on this side of town often and I feel like now I have these hawaiian bbq cravings when within range. Awesome place, I will be back often"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The food a great and filling. You defiantly get what you pay for! The staff is friendly and welcoming. This will always be a place to stop for some good dinner."}
{"text":"Pretty good Hawaiian BBQ place. Better than Ono Hawaiian in Goodyear."}
{"text":"I order takeout from here all the time, love the place. Is it like flying to Hawaii and popping into your favorite grind house? Nope.  Is the food delicious and satisfies your cravings for Hawaiian BBQ? heck yes, honestly you can not go wrong with anything on the menu..  From the lighter Lemon Pepper Chicken to the BBQ Beef  on to the gravy topped Loco Moco and ending with the Spam Musubi, it is all perfectly flavored and cooked.    Price point is spot on as well.  oh and don't forget to pour some sriracha on your mac salad!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place! Macaroni salad is the best. Family owned and always kept clean. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I had a friend from Hawaii who said this was \"a lot like home\", so skeptical me decided to give it a try. Keep in mind that I have little to no idea of what constitutes Hawaiian food, but I know what I like.  And I like Leo's, if ya don't get me anything with spam. The BBQ chicken sandwich (yeah, I wasn't feeling adventurous) was a little sloppy but way good. I like how their sandwiches have generous cucumber slices rather than pickle, and a bit of this sweet, creamy slaw. The chicken katsu was also delicious, and they have some amazing sauces to go with it.  You can also choose between a fountain drinks or some awesome nectar they have in the fridge. Prices are VERY affordable, as this will cost you marginally more than a fast food meal, but you get way better stuff.  If you're like me and you don't know crap about food from this region, I can't think of a better place to get acquainted."}
{"text":"I've driven past this place millions of times, but I finally made it inside to try it out a few weeks ago. The staff were friendly and engaged and were kind enough to make some recommendations on what time try. I had the curry Katsu chicken. The portion was huge! Tons of veggies, rice, chicken, and sauce. I would recommend sharing since it took multiple meals for me to finish the one order. I can't wait to try it again!"}
{"text":"A very cool little joint in a strip mall.  We couldn't help but sample each other's food from our party and everything was amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Hawaiian food place in town. Food is good and price for the actual meal is reasonable. The musubis are a little overpriced. I'm from Hawaii and musubis are $1 a piece there."}
{"text":"I have NO IDEA why people are giving this place such high reviews.  I took a couple friends here for lunch because of the great reviews alone.  I was horribly embarrassed.  I took some pics of what I threw away - pretty much all of it.  I'll try to get them uploaded - you should know what you are in for at this place.  The food here is, without contest, the worst food I have had in Phoenix.  I wanted a variety of food to try so I got the Island BBQ Mix.  The \"beef\" was riddled with gristle.  Most of the meat was tough and completely inedible.  The chicken was rubbery.  I have no idea what the third meat was in the dish but suffice it to say that, after trying to find any tender meat around the bone, I gave up as it turned out to be a useless effort.  The other thing people were raving about in the reviews was the macaroni salad - What the f@$#@$k!?!  I suppose that some people simply love elbow macaroni with mayo....that is all it was - no other flavor of any kind.    I guess I should have turned around and walked out when I saw where you pick up your plastic utensils from an open bin.  One one can only imagine others reaching their filthy hands in to grab a handful of plasticware and put some back.  I would rather eat at a \"restaurant\" with a drive through than this place.  Save your money and time.  Skip this horrible disappointment."}
{"text":"Great island food! reasonably priced. Awesome taste! Can't beat it. I lived on Oahu for a few years and lived the food. Missed it very much until i found this place!"}
{"text":"Great food! All of us tried something different and sampled from each other's meal. There wasn't anything we tried that wasn't good. While I hardly ever get to the area (do NOT like going to the Phoenix area), if I find myself there, I'd definitely go back to this place."}
{"text":"You've got to stop in and visit these guys. Food? Great! Staff? Friendly! I've even run into the managers/owners at different stores. They smile and wave. Okay, I'm a bit hard to forget! 6'4 Big white guy!!!  have yet to really have an issue with them. If you're asking my opinion, just go stuff your face with their food!"}
{"text":"This island BBQ is one of the best things to link me to home. The food is cooked right, and they have a great selection of food that you will never grow tired of. A couple of great selections include their spam musubis' and their manapua. Great way to start the day. I suggest everyone give this place a try, you won't be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"Ok... 4.5 stars out of over 200 reviews? I don't understand it. The quality of the meat, chicken, and spare ribs was so poor it was almost inedible. Most of it was fat, grisle, or breading. The mac salad was beyond bland. Noodles, mayo and that was about it. Yes you get a lot of food for the money but it's not worth the stomach upset you'll experience later. I guess if you're used to fast food places like BK and Macdonalds then this is similar."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Great service!!  Does get crowded but hey..  That just means great food!!"}
{"text":"First time having \"Hawaiian\" food here and was a bit wary as we all know Vegas is the Ninth Hawaiian Island, so that is probably the closest it gets even if is mainland. However, maybe there's a correlation LV and AZ are both desert-y right?  Came in expecting a L&L's kind of vibe/decor, but was thrown off it looks like any typical chinese take-out place. Pretty small interior with chairs and tables, drink fridge and register to order. I ended up ordering Spam Musubi and a Chicken Combo meal, which came out to around $12. I totally forgot that these types of spots are insanely generous with portions and that I typically get the Mini sizes. Nonetheless, the Spam Musubi was delicious in all it's simplistic assembly, you get two huge pieces. Spam seriously takes me back to my childhood eats. The combo meal came with teriyaki chicken that was really well marinated and so tender, it honestly didn't need Teriyaki sauce (tbh I forgot to grab some) and the Katsu was so crispy and delicious with their Katsu sauce. Well cooked rice, steamed/sauteed vegetables and that distinct macaroni salad. Their salad is a bit more on the onion-y side opposed to sweet which I like and definitely complements the meal. I just wish I got more of it!  Parking is spacious in the plaza, it shares a lot with Baskin Robbins that's next door. Service took a bit of time, but it's better to wait than to have raw food. They also accept credit card here."}
{"text":"This place is good. I went with a friend and both our meals were awesome.  He loved the macaroni salad so much, he got seconds. The BBQ chicken and beef are both delicious.  Their sauces are great. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The lemon pepper chicken was just like rubber. When asked about changing it they said that they couldn't because I took a bite of the food. They said that is how it is supposed to be however I have had many other Hawaiian BBQ places and the chicken wasn't rubber. I would have rated it 0 stars but I the lowest I could rate it was 1."}
{"text":"Best macaroni salad I've ever had! YUM! The food is delicious and the staff are always so nice. They keep the place really clean too! Katsu chicken is my favorite."}
{"text":"Food was quick and delicious. My husband loves Hawaiian BBQ and unfortunately there are hardly any in WA state. This was exactly what he wanted and helped curb those cravings."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered food online and picked it up in our way home after a long day of shopping...this hit the spot.   Great food and large portions.   We could only eat half of our order and had the rest for lunch the next day.   I highly recommend giving this place a shot."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Ono's Hawaiian food so when I noticed this place I got excited.    It looks just like Ono's and tastes just like Ono's!    The service was great.  Super friendly staff.  Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place forever and I finally got to yesterday.  The food lived up to my expectations but why the 3 stars?  I had the intention of writing this as a 5 star review but hours later into the evening, I came down with food poisoning.  My meal from here was the only meal I had for the day and I suspected my sickness was a result of it.  Taste - 5 stars, service - 4 stars.  My evening - 0 stars :(  I am willing to come back here to try more food once I get over my trauma lol.  I think it was a one-off situation and I will update accordingly."}
{"text":"Yummy, fast. The place is clean, try serve your food to you. The workers are friendly !  Island BBQ mix is my fav!"}
{"text":"Kali short ribs. Chicken Katsu. Spam musubi. Mac and rice. Love this place!  I could go every night but then I'd weigh 400lbs. Takes me back to my days on Oahu."}
{"text":"We're going to Hawai'i soon so we decided to start trying some island food to be somewhat prepared. Of course I'm sure it'll still be different a bit when we actually get there but nonetheless we tried Leo's. Awesome! I had the chicken rib combo with a spam sandwich. Two thumbs up! The katsu was well worth it itself, and the spam burger was an interesting twist for spam..but I loved it. Will definitely visit alot."}
{"text":"New Fave Place for Hawaiian Grinds!  Saw Leo's highlighted on Yelp! and thought to give it a try after another disappointment at the other places in town. Very glad I did.  My wife had the Kalua Pork, I had the BBQ Mix, our older daughter went Noodle Bowl, and we got Chicken Katsu for our toddler. All washed down with Hawaiian Sun fruit drinks, of course. And took some spam musubi and manapua to go.  Food is excellent with ample portions. Kalbi and teriyaki chicken reminded me of home. I loved the mac salad. However, my daughters thought it too oniony. lol  The staff were cool. A lady who seemed like an owner or manager connected with our toddler. Very nice people.  Alas, no kimchee on the side and no poi or haupia for dessert. That's minor, though.  It's nice to get and island feel in Phoenix as the chances aren't common. And leaving with a full tummy is even better!"}
{"text":"LEOS ISLAND BBQ IS MY FAVORITE PLACE TO EAT IN THE WHOLE VALLEY! But seriously. So much food, incredible service, clean atmosphere, and the food is DELISH! 12/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"No frills, friendly staff, delicious food. This place is great. This is a place Anthony Bourdain would love because it is straight forward, fried, and delicious."}
{"text":"So so food. You can get the same type of meal at any mall food court anywhere. I had the BBQ chicken. It was ok. I was expecting something much better considering all of the positive reviews. Maybe I should have tried something else."}
{"text":"This place is is awesome! The seafood plate and the island bbq mix are great!  In wash of the mentioned plates you get three meets/seafood. All the plates are served with macaroni salad, cabbage, mixed veggies and steamed rice."}
{"text":"My family moved to Arizona almost two years ago, from Hawaii. We picked Leo's keeping our expectations realistic, because, really how close could they be to the island cuisine we grew to love for 30+ years? I can tell you we were pleasantly surprised! The food( especially the Mac salad) was spot on! My son had the delicious manapuas, he ate two of them! Aside from the food being seriously Ono, the restaurant was clean! Usually in Hawaii, when you want this specific kind of food, you'd be walking in to some little hole in the wall, where you were guaranteed a mess. The counters and the tables were consistently wiped down, the soda machine was spotless, and all the windows and doors were clean! Ok, now to #3, the employees were so friendly! THe guy at the cash register smiled and greeted us, he was patient while we tried to figure out what to eat. We were brought our order to our table, including napkins and forks! When we left, the lady asked if we needed a bag for our take out containers- I've been to nice restaurants that haven't taken the time to give us that courtesy! Anyway, long review aside, If you are looking for some Ono grinds- Hawaiian style- check this place out! You won't be disappointed. Great food, very clean, and awesome customer service!"}
{"text":"LOVE Leo's. Their short ribs are my favorite.   Their catering is great also.  We had them cater a birthday party and were pleasantly surprised and the amount of food we got for the money.    Highly recommend them."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot when I first tried it and have eaten here multiple times, but the last time left a bad impression, particularly in regards to the freshness of their food. I got a pretty gnarly stomachache after having their lemon pepper chicken, and the fried rice seemed a little old. The other times I've had the chicken katsu, and it was consistently good. You get a ton of chicken, good amount of rice, and a small macaroni salad with the dishes, and it usually was enough to have two meals. Service is friendly and your order is prepared quickly. The place is a little hard to find though, as it's not clearly visible off of Bell Road, so GPS directions have been useful the first couple of times I came here.   I don't know if I'll be returning though as my experience last time wasn't a great one. I hope they pay more attention to the freshness of their ingredients next time. It's also concerning that I read another review about someone possibly getting food poisoning here."}
{"text":"Our group totaled 5 people, and we arrived in two separate cars.  Parking was easy on a rainy Saturday night, as the place is located in the mini-mall across from Arrowhead Mall.   I surveyed two others here at the house, afterwards - one rated it a 4 star, one rated it 3.2 \"because it's freakin' small\" and I gave it a 4.5, for a total of 3.9 stars. I'd bet the actual stars went up if I asked the other two, as they thought it was ultra-convenient to be able to walk next door afterwards and have their pick of 31 flavors of ice cream.   So, the place is SMALL. Not much seating inside, with a few two-tops outside (which don't do any good on the few days in Phoenix it does rain). However, the staff immediately drug a 2-top next to a 4-top to accomodate a party of 5, as the tables designed for that were taken. Extra points there, for sure.   Food was great, and they brought us samples of beef/chicken to taste as we decided. We tried quite a few things - although somehow nobody went with the Spam, nor the fish available - which are both valuable menu items and Spam is hard to find - so if you want it, u can get it here, a couple of different ways.   You can get combo meals (2 or more items), mini meals (1 item), or \"burger\" options on a few thngs. Meals come with rice (somewhat sticky and fluffy), pasta salad which is basically pasta, carrots and mayo (yay! no \"salad whip\" crap) but could use a bit of spicing up. Oh yeah, they lay the proteins on a bed of steamed (?) cabbage. Nice touch, cooked so its crisp yet tender.   The beef and pork are very good. The chicken I think we all agreed leaned a bit to the too-sweet teriyaki side. Crab rangoons are nicely fried, with a bit of crab and a mild cream cheese. I heard the egg rolls were also tasty, the veggies were minced well so no \"stringy\" problems,  with a kick of fresh ginger and a nice thin wrapper.   Portions on everything we ordered were large. Everyone had leftovers. So, don't let the price discourage you - and you might consider sharing a combo.  Sweet/sour sauce was sweet with little sour. Teriyaki is, well, teriyaki. The soy sauce was Korean, and a bit on the light side - but I'm kinda set in my ways on soy sauce.   Service, as I eluded to - was awesome. Totally family-run from what I could tell. A lot of Hawaiian patrons surrounded us - so I'd suspect its as authentic as you might get on the mainland, in the middle of the desert.  They also have a selection of Hawaiian-made beverages in cans, which aren't spectacular, but I chose to go that route (no one else did) because I like to support businesses that import specific items! Otherwise, they have Coca-cola products and I prefer Pepsico. #justsayin.  If yer in the mall, or wanna try some bbq that isn't bathed in smoke or one of the well-known styles of sauce, give this a shot, for sure. If you are looking for a kick of spice, bring yer own - because I didn't see any way to kick it up a notch. It's very \"commerical and chain-looking\" from the outside, but I can assure you it doesn't taste that way. I forgive their choice of mall location and wish them well! We'll go back for sure.  I added a scan of one side of the menu for an idea of what they have! Check it in the photo section!"}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with Hawaiian food and so I may be short-sighted in my review, but I didn't really care for Leo's.  My husband liked his pretty well and would probably have gone with a high three, but since this is my review I need to give it a 2.  The place was very clean and cheery in a strip mall restaurant sort of way.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken.  It came with cabbage and my original thought was, great, something pretty healthy.  But, the cabbage was underneath the chicken which was soaked in the teriyaki sauce and was somewhat greasy.  This made the cabbage quite soggy and unappealing to my taste.  It also came with a generous scoop of their macaroni salad.  I would have to agree with one of the other reviewers who said it had too much mayonnaise and not enough flavor.    I would pass on going back - but my plus one would probably be easily persuaded."}
{"text":"I always get the #8 Island BBQ mix...it gives you a little bit of everything:). I've never had a bad meal here, it's always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Location & Aesthetics - Located in Peoria in the same shopping center as  Hobby Lobby.  Parking is plentiful though there are surrounding businesses and it may at times be difficult to find suitable parking.  Parking lot is large and well lit too. The restaurant is well lit and seating is ample though I would've like to see more seating.  The restaurant was clean as was the bathroom.  Menu - The menu is very simple and is posted on large billboard like signs over the cashier.    Service - The staff was spectacularly nice, friendly, warm and welcoming and answered any questions I had.  Prices were very reasonable.  Food - this restaurant, their menu, and even their name reminds me of a Caribbean restaurant and they even try to mimic their meals after a Caribbean restaurant, e.g. all or most dishes come with rice and vegetables similar to Caribbean dishes. The veggies were moist, fresh, and crunchy.  The rice (white) was soft and well steamed.  I had the pork ends which was well seasoned, soft and tender.  Definitely will be coming back here for more!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Leo's for lunch and dinner well over a dozen times and they serve consistently great tasting food and the staff always provides service with a smile.  I waver as to what my favorite plate lunch is, but recently I've been doing the seafood mix- which is shrimp, fish filets and their hawaiian-style bbq chicken served with steamed sticky rice, steamed vegetables and the best macaroni salad in the world. You can opt for brown rice for .50 cents. If you haven't tried their short ribs, you better order those because they're outstanding, but so is the Kalua Pork, Loco Moco and the curry.  If you like Chinese-style steamed pork buns (and if you have taste buds, you should love them), they call them Manapua here and they're really good.   The dining room is small- only room for about 30 people if it's fully packed in wall-to-wall, but there are a couple of outdoor tables for days when the sun isn't scorching. Calling ahead for carry-out is fine for those days when you want to binge watch Game Of Thrones in your boxer shorts, but don't forget to take some katsu sauce, teriyaki and soy sauce with you when you pick up your grub.   I would recommend Leo's to anyone, and if they don't like their food, I'd delete their contact info immediately and unfriend them on facebook."}
{"text":"So yummy!  I've always had good experiences here.  As one user calls the Mac Salad, \"Crackeroni Salad\"...they're spot on.  I have to say, once I've finished my Mac Salad, I start poaching of my boys' plates!  It's so good!"}
{"text":"I've tried a few hawaiian BBQ spot around the valley and hands down, Leo's is the best. I swear I could probably eat here all day, every day! They have the best macaroni salad! So good & so addictive. My go to is their chicken combo plate. Chicken katsu & bbq chicken with no rice, extra mac with their teriyaki sauce!!   Their chicken is always juicy. The katsu is always nice and crispy. Food is made fresh to order & always quick & very friendly service here. Their short ribs always hit the spot for me every once in a while. Perfectly marinated & grilled to perfection."}
{"text":"Great food!  The chicken was tender and fish was nice and flakey. The staff is always cleaning to keep an inviting environment."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They give huge serving sizes of tasty meats and sides. The family meal is probably one of the best deals you can get in the whole valley."}
{"text":"Excellent food with a large?selection to choose from. We are definitely returns when in this area. Leo's looks like a carry out store, but tables are available and the service is friendly and fast. Try it you will like."}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here for lunch after church one Sunday. We like \"mom and pop\" restaurants and found this little gem across from Barnes and Noble. Must say that we LOVED it! I got the chicken teriyaki and deep fried shrimp, and he got the same add deep fried fish. The chicken was so tender, the sauce amazing! Nice batter on the shrimp, not greasy or heavy. The dipping sauce (can't spell it) had a great tangy/sweet flavor that we both enjoyed. Good service, clean restaurant, nice portion sizes. Well worth a stop! Support your local eateries!"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Leo's for a few years now and love the kind service, flavorful combos and the value of the food. The sauces are really tasty and are complimentary with your order. I prefer this establishment over other fast Hawaiian places."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Have tried their BBQ chicken and BBQ beef, Katsu chicken and short ribs. All were great, our favorites are the BBQ chicken and Katsu chicken. Everyone we've told about it love it too. It is made fresh so takes a little bit to make, but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times and love the food. Just realized I haven't yet written a review, so this is it. The best Hawaiian food I've had outside of Hawaii hands down."}
{"text":"I'm addicted. I come here often and the food is always delicious and is consistent.  The service is always friendly and I will tell you, this is the CLEANEST restaurant I've ever been in.  They take pride in this place and it shows in the freshness and quality of the food and the cleanliness of the entire restaurant.  We usually get the teriyaki bowls, with egg rolls, but we've also had the lemon chicken and BBQ chicken and it's all so delicious!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Grabbed Leo's for dinner over the weekend. This was my first time trying it and I was definitely impressed!  I ordered the chicken combo, which has two types of chicken (Chicken Katsu and BBQ Chicken). I really enjoyed the Katsu but it's a good thing that I grabbed sauce because they didn't include any inside the box. The BBQ Chicken was awesome - tender and flavorful.   The to-go box is filled to the brim with meat, rice and a delicious pasta salad. The prices are great for how much food you get.   I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"With plenty of Bbq places around I decided to stop by and give this one a try. I am glad I did. The place is small but cozy and the service was good. I ordered number 8 which had chicken and steak Bbq with white rice and vegetables. They give good portions and the meat is very tasteful. I went back there again a week later and was not disappointed.  Great find."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's a hidden gem out here in Peoria.  I come here all the time. The staff has always been very friendly and very helpful, and the place is always very clean. The were in the New Times a few years ago, and for very good reason.  I've tried a very good portion of the menu and I have never been disappointed, its all great. However, some of my favorites include the Curry BBQ Chicken Mini Meal (don't let the name fool you - its still a good amount of food!), the Chicken Katsu (don't forget the Katsu sauce), and Island BBQ Mix! They also have Bao Buns AKA Cha Sui AKA Manapua (Its hawaiian, duh), and they are good.  Skip the soda fountain and hit up the canned Aloha beverages - yum!  I told my co-worker that I come here as often as my wife will let me, and its true!"}
{"text":"Very solid place to eat, whether for lunch or dinner. I like the bbq chicken and beef plate, which comes with a bed of steamed vegetables. Comes with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad, which is good. Took off a star as the one time I had the lemon pepper chicken, it was very dry."}
{"text":"Like to take out from here. Mac salad, rice. I like to get combo with short ribs which comes with veggies, mac salad, and rice. Spam Musubi = good. Chicken Katsu (reg or with curry) also good."}
{"text":"When you first walk in you will likely receive a warm greeting. The customer service is on par. The lighting is far too bright. The place reminds me of Ono Hawaiian BBQ. I almost feel like they are one in the same. The color scheme. The plastic seating. The bright lights. The less-than-thrilling food.   On my visit I acquired the following provisions: BBQ Chicken and Beef, Short Ribs, and Kalua Pork. The beef had the best flavor and was easily the best meat. Tender, but still a bit chewy. The chicken was decent, pretty standard. The ribs were at least fifty percent fat and the other half were still greasy, chewy, and basically inedible. And although the pork received great accolades in a New Times article, it fell significantly short. It was almost reminiscent of canned chicken or tuna and lacking any real flavor. The macaroni salad was of course tasty and possibly the most enjoyable part of the meal.   All in all Leo's was a disappointing experience. Just okay. Aloha Kitchen is still my choice pick for Hawaiian."}
{"text":"Sandy I see little reason for high ratings.   I had 3 meet combo and found meal cool, beef tough, chicken and pork ok.  $9.00 plus wanted $1 more for fried rice.  Pepsi products."}
{"text":"Just tried on Monday 5-16 it's a great change of taste for a seat down lunch , we'll be back ."}
{"text":"Came here for loco moco since I haven't had it in a very long time. I walk in and there's 3 costumers at 8pm on a Monday night. I browse the menu for the loco moco and I'm asked if I'd like some samples. I agree. I get bbq chicken, katie chicken, and bbq beef. The beef was really good and I liked the bbq chicken too. I couldn't help but order my loco moco AND a small bbq chicken (both come with rice, I little bit of veggies, and a scoop of Mac salad.) the loco moco was pretty good. Now, it doesn't compare to the best I've had in Oahu, HI but it IS pretty good. It's a huge container and the other patty had to be saved for left over next day dinner. The place is well cleaned and employees are super friendly and welcoming. If I'm ever in the area and in mood for Hawaiian food, I'll for sure go straight to this one!!"}
{"text":"I really really liked this place. It's not perfect but pretty damn delicious.  I got the short rib plate (#10) it was just under $10 (before tax?) and a large side of steamed veggies. Qty was pretty generous so this was 2 meals for me!  Short rib plate ~$10 -Comes w/ 2 scoops of rice, 1 scoop mac salad, steamed veggies & ~5 pcs of short rib. -Short rib was so tender! Was able to EASILY cut through with plastic knife. Pcs were pretty big, seasoning spot on! -Mac salad was good. Seasoning fell a bit short (compared to L&L back in California), cook and creaminess was great though. (just me being nit-picky).  Steamed veggies (large side): ~$4.50 -wow this was HUGE. I probably should've gotten a small. They're very generous here. Steam veggies had mainly cabbage but also broccoli, carrots, cauliflower.  Great place, cheap & big quantities. Would come back!"}
{"text":"Soooooooooooooo much food !!! A box will range from $8/9 and there's more than enough for leftovers. You're getting two meals for the price of one.  Leos never fail to satisfy me the food isn't made until you order so you do have to wait for a little but we'll worth the wait . I like the chicken combo ( bbq chicken + Katsu) but the Katsu box comes with so much more meat. They have prepackaged teriyaki and Katsu sauce in plastic containers easy to grab you don't have to ask so you can grab as much as you'd like. I'm a regular loyal customer for life."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  This is probably one of the better Hawaiian/Japanese fusion/non-sushi, fast food type places to get lunch in this area. From best to mediocre, it goes: L&Ls, Leo's, Island Teriyaki, Samurai Sam's. It actually reminds me of L&L a lot. I love their chicken katsu, beef short ribs, macaroni salad, chicken and beef teriyaki. Price is good for the serving size. Definitely worth a try if you are craving this type of food and are in the area."}
{"text":"At times the ribs are nothing but fat, and very little meat. I don't like chewing on fat. Their curry sauce is probably one of the best I've had. I pour it over my rice and ribs."}
{"text":"This family run business is the next best thing to dining by sunset in Hawaii!  First off, the place is immaculate beyond compare-and you always see the owners and servers tidying up a spotless shop.  The food is freshly prepared as you order-and delish doesn't begin to describe it.  You can indulge your whims with fried delights or maintain your calorie conscious ways with their grilled options like BBQ Chicken-my fave!  I am always greeted with a warm smile-and they know my order before I state it!  Great weekday lunch specials.  While I live on the other side of town, when I can it is one of my travel stops."}
{"text":"We've been here numerous times and it's the best Hawaiian food I've had in this state. I usually get the Chicken combo and my wife gets the kalua pork, the portions are nice and big, and the sauce for the rice is delicious! The service is always good too. I come here whenever I get the chance"}
{"text":"OMG. This place is great. It reminds us of Cafe 101 in Hilo. They have  loco moco, masubi, and other great island favorites. Their pineapple sauce for the pineapple chicken is to die for. Again, OMG. You don't have to fly for 5 hours to great a great Hawaiian flavor."}
{"text":"a friend got me hooked.....cheap food..the asian lady is sweet and fun and very quiet...this tiny restaurant is the BOMB...occasionally you have your big buffooon out of state people standing around trying to figure out how to fit 6 laaarge people in the tiny restaurant...but bcz the food is soo tasty and fresh..its worth it..Bring on the clown show any day-anything to eat that macaroni salad and I dont like macaroni salad....I have now also ventured on to attempting to eat with chopstix....which my asian friend laughs at  cuz I suck at it....."}
{"text":"These guys never disappoint - great example of how a restaurant should be run. Fresh, friendly, consistent, and damn tasty."}
{"text":"The food is not authentic. If you want the Chinese version of Hawaiian food, then you should come here. The ribs were like chewing fat... I literally spit them out multiple times thinking I was chewing on fat. The food is very greasy. The macaroni salad was macaroni, carrots, and mayonnaise. It tasted like I was eating mayonnaise straight from the jar. Paid almost $40 for this, and I'd rather eat ANYWHERE else than here."}
{"text":"Order the chicken katsu or bbq chicken combos. They are delicious and I'm pretty sure that's what the chicken would have wanted.  Show your Midwestern Student ID and they take $$ money off the total. That's pronounced \"cash money\" in case you were wondering.  Make sure to grab a fortune cookie on your way out. Mine usually says nice things but sometimes they are strange too.  -----  All in all the BEST Hawaiian BBQ in Glendale. I come here just about once a week and always leave satisfied.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"It's probably been over 5 years since I've last had Hawaiian food, so I decided to stop by since I live less than a mile away. Wow, this place is great - fantastic food at a great price, and massive portions to boot! First time I went, I ordered the Island Loco Moco. I loved how the egg was just slightly runny, which gave the rest of the dish extra flavor. The gravy was also very tasty and went well the hamburger patty and rice. The 2 patties were cooked well and not dry at all. Just to balance the meal, the patties sat on a bed on cabbage. Macaroni salad was on point too. I didn't plan on finishing the whole thing, but I did!  The second time I came here (only a couple days later), I ordered the chicken rib combo which was just as good. It came with chicken katsu, BBQ chicken, and short ribs. The katsu had the perfect crispness, the BBQ chicken was moist, and the ribs were very similar to kalbi that you would get at a Korean restaurant (for a fraction of the price!). If I had to make a small nitpicky complaint, it would have been nice to have gravy or curry sauce on the side for the katsu.  Overall, this place is great and I'm happy that this place is so close to where I live. I've already been here twice in a few days and I plan on coming more often!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've ate. And I don't say that much. Being from Hawaii I couldn't find a great place to eat that reminded me of the Hawaii culture and I missed it so much then a co-worker told me about this place and I thank him everyday for this recommendation, showed my wife this place and now she can't get enough of it, I think we ate it about 3 times this week. Great place would recommend 100%!!!!!"}
{"text":"Have heard good things about this place. Went there specifically for the Loco Moco and I must say I was very impressed. Excellent gravy beef patties cooked to perfection eggs were nice and runny. Reminds me of Hawaii. Plus a very large portion for only $10 out the door. They give you two large beef patties to over easy eggs two scoops of rice one scoop of macaroni salad and vegetables underneath. Everything was hot and fresh. The service was friendly and helpful. Only problem I wish they had one on the east side of town. If you're in the neighborhood and looking for a classic Loco Moco this is your spot. Definitely will be coming back again."}
{"text":"This did not live up to the hype that everyone writes about this was one of my must try places since it had such good reviews and I was a little disappointed. The food was good not great but good I wouldn't recommend it to a friend if they asked about it so that is one of the reason's for the three star's."}
{"text":"Some damn good Hawaiian food! Great prices and great portions. The only reason why I didn't give this place a solid 5 stars is because of their galbi. They pretty much use the shittiest quality galbi you can use. It was all fat and hardly any meat. Other than that, this place is baaaahmb."}
{"text":"5 stars due to efficient service, friendly people, ample seating, great food, esp. the macaroni grill, and reasonable prices. Love it."}
{"text":"Meat quality is not so good. It's a normal dish. If you want Chinese food, you can feel good to eat this. But this is just ok for me."}
{"text":"Good food. Here to watch son play baseball.  Try something different. Food really good. Big portions. Only down side, for some reason smelled like a nail salon. And the kids working here were very nice. Will be back"}
{"text":"It's a bit small but it has a nice friendly feel to it. Helpful and honest staff members and not too pricey. Nothing bad to report here."}
{"text":"I got the teriyaki chicken bowel my wife got the Mahi-mahi sandwich. All was good. The service was good. One place you can get a spam burger if you like spam.  There were many regulars there eating. You could tell by the interaction with the staff.  I have been here 3 times and while the food is good and the service is good it still remains a 3 star. Maybe just me."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop Hawaiian joint. The people are super awesome and the food is fresh and amazing. We have  used Leos to cater 3 parties so far and it blew the guests away every time. Personally I love the lemon pepper chicken but haven't had anything I didn't like so far."}
