{"text":"My son and his friends used to love this place!  They went last night with a gift card I had purchased for him in February.  The employees told him they couldn't take the gift card because it wouldn't swipe through their system.  Apparently there are new owners and they are not honoring these from the previous owners. But hanks for taking my money!  The boys ate anyway and said they won't be back.  The food was bad in their opinion. Menu has changed completely. Bid you can't get the teenagers to like your food you won't be open long."}
{"text":"I really love What About Bob's.  Seriously cheap food - better than any chain (expect maybe Jimmy John's).  Lots of designated parking spots and everyone that works there seems to be very friendly.  There are about 12 options for subs or wraps, chicken wings,  lots of canned or bottled soda to choose from and some chips, as well.  The interior is small, but doesn't make me uncomfortable.  The patio furniture indoors seems ironic, but it works.   Why only 4 stars? Admittedly, the man statue out front kind of creeps me out.  Also, I wish they were open late night - I would LOVE to have a delicious sub after closing time at Willoughby Brewing Co."}
{"text":"What About Bob's has been a favorite place of mine for a while.  I worked in DTW around the time it first opened, and was immediately a fan.  GREAT subs, and the price is fantastic (even though they've gone up a little since they first opened) for what you get.    $9 gets you a 24\" sub so jam packed with meat, cheese, and toppings that you'll be lucky to get through half of it.  I am a BIG eater, and I can easily make a Bob's sub last 3 meals.  Ok, not EASILY as they taste amazing, but I can when I want to.  I usually get the #5 Italian, and the bread is always crispy and chewy, and the toppings always taste fresh.  I was a little concerned about   At the time of this review, they're sharing the location with TANK'S, a burger and burrito place owned by the same family.  Skip the burgers and the burritos, stick with the subs.  The space merger opens it up, and there is a good amount of seating available.    The last time I was there, I went with a friend from Lakewood, and he also agreed that the place was top notch."}
{"text":"Great subs and friendly staff. Very small dining area though. I would recommend take out if your not a fan of crowds.  Probably 6-8 plastic patio tables with plastic chairs are set up for eating. I had the Italian sub, pretty good stuff. Standard Italian sub meats salami, ham etc. lettuce, tomato, onion and their house sauce (mayo and spices maybe some oil in there too) I enjoyed it! The bread is very hard, so be careful. The roof of your mouth will suffer. My bf had the same sub, but he ordered his as a wrap instead of on the bread that I had. I think I might do that next time. Prices are cheap under $15 for 2 huge subs and 2 drinks."}
{"text":"HUGE sandwiches. Great value -- can't beat the price $3.99 for 1 foot!"}
{"text":"It's a great place for lunch, the value is out of this world.  They say 12\" sub but it's normally bigger than that.   I normally get a 12\" turkey wrap....i swear it's at least 2 lbs of meat.  I never had to wait more than a minute or two, and the staff is friendly.  I wonder how they sell stuff so cheap...the meat reminds me of subway meats.  Not bad, but it's not  high-end stuff.  Overall they are tasty, do a great job and friendly.  By all means, go!"}
{"text":"I ate at What About Bob's Subs for the first time today. I never would have thought to try it unless a friend had recommended to me. Awesome lunch place and great value. There were a lot of people in line and waiting but it didn't take long at all. There is some seating but it seemed like most people were getting lunch to go.  I'd eat here over a chain like Subway or Jersey Mike's any day."}
{"text":"What I like most about Bob's is that it's that it's an independent shop which I think is much better than hitting up a BK or McDonalds. I always support small business whenever possible.   You get a lot for your money here; I had a double bacon cheeseburger for $5, which I think is a bargain. I was happily mowing down all the way till my last bite- that's when I hit a moldy spot on my bun. I'd finished 98% of it, so there was no way I could take it back. Oh well, live and learn, I'm sure it was a fluke."}
{"text":"what happened to this place? i used to go here all the time and loved it. huge menu. great prices. great everything. they got rid of the mexican menu (loved the tacos personally) then they tried to compete with melt. they closed down for a bit and come back and like 3/4th of the massive awesome menu is gone. nothing i wanna eat there....this place is now officially dead to me."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite sub shop on the East Side. The bread used to be fresh, cheese aplenty, and the toppings were flavorful and fresh. Not so much anymore.  Not sure what has happened, but the past few times I've dined here the subs have been a disappointment. Not sure if or why the new management has changed things, but I definitely miss the kind of subs this place use to produce :("}
{"text":"I'm eating my sub as I write this.  WOW.  $4.99 for a 12\" sub that is really good.  Fresh baked bread and the darn thing is packed full.  The place I work at did a mass order of 15 subs and everyone loves it.  Don't let a line stop you from leaving a good rating, it only means that people love this place so its just something you have to deal with.  Call in the order like we did, its a breeze.   I went with the #1.  I am saving the other half for later.  Get over there and get a sub, hell we traveled from Euclid/Cleveland border just for them and am thinking of making this an every Friday thing.  Just a quick update: Just had my 2nd sub from there and it was great.  They added a 6\" sub option for $2.99 and carry all subs as wraps too.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Good subs, Great prices, and Huge sizes. A  sub on the smaller side is so packed full of meats and cheese, and with the thick bread, I can barely finish a 6inch.  Just wish they took debit/credit instead of being CASH ONLY. As this makes my decision often since I personally never carry cash, but on the rare occasions I do, I will choose good old WABS!"}
{"text":"Boo the new owners!  Whoever thought it was a good idea to change this once wonderful establishment should re-evaluate their business abilities.  What About Bob's was awesome, had a huge menu, delicious food and great prices....not anymore!  Under \"new ownership\" the menu is now a quarter of the size if not less and the prices are almost doubled.  Why would someone do such a terrible thing?"}
{"text":"This place has the biggest subs I have ever seen. This place gives you lots of food for the price you pay. I wish there was one of these in Cali. I had the ultimate Italian and it was a monster of a sub. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a good place with great subs and lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Now has moved to Pizza Booyah on Euclid Avenue.  They simply make great subs.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The \"Ultimate Original\" sub, without peppers, came out an Italian, with peppers. But how can I blame the woman at the counter? With the music blaring and the bass thumping, a fire truck could pass through the shop and you wouldn't notice.  The sandwich was ... ok. Chewy, crusty bread; good meat-to-bread ratio. But every person who ordered a sandwich while I was there -- and it took forever to get my order -- ended up walking out with their order rather than staying to eat; the music is overpowering.  Very basic menu -- subs and wraps, a couple salads. No sides; a wide variety of chips are spread out on shelves in front of the counter.   The one amazing thing is the price: $3.99 for a 12-inch sub that's really too big for most people. It's a great deal, though I'd wish for a more reasonable size -- the 12-inch is the \"small\"; the other choice is a 2-foot-long.  Conclusion? A bargain if you're just in the mood for a sandwich, but place your order and wait outside, and take it to go down to Wes Point Park."}
{"text":"Stayed up from midnight to six last night drinking and having sixties dance party with my pa-in-law. We did the monkey, the swim, the batusi, and my specialty-the Davy Jones. Also argued about the merits of the so called holiday of Thankstaking and how i should hook my PC up to my tv(huh?). Then we got yelled at by ma-in law for being too loud.  After all that, i scoured their fridge for food like a raccoon in a trashcan. Leftover veggie sub from What About Bob's to the rescue! Even better than last time. The dressing was a light tapinade-ish concoction and the mushrooms were fresh. Lots of cheese. Fell asleep watching Mini-Me's Cribs episode."}
{"text":"Last year, my rating would have been five stars.  I just found out that the place is under new ownership and everything that was once great about this place has changed, except for the name of the business. It's a bummer, because they really had a great thing going."}
{"text":"First time, so I can't say what it was like under the previous owners. Pretty good corned beef sandwich and chocolate shake."}
{"text":"Here are three things people say about \"What about Bob's\"...1.  Cheap   2.  Good Bread   3.  Good Fries.   Now, I agree with all three, but I have only given them 2 stars for one major flaw  Their cheese.  It is difficult, somewhat unappetizing, and just plain weird, to use shredded cheese on a sub. Specifically, a COLD sub.  For the salads, sure. But this place has all kinds of different cheeses (burger choices), don't they have sliced cheese?  Maybe not? The bread is great, topping selection wide and vast...but the first time I ordered the sub...I was really disappointed with the fact that the cheese was shredded and falling out of my sub.  I ended up plucking it all out.  Bummer. With this being said, it will be my duty, to just come out and ask next time I visit.  And I encourage any of you reading this review, to do the same, on your next visit.  As for the other menu items, burgers are not bad for the price, salads doable,  and the fries are pretty darn tasty.  I will continue to be a customer because my kids love it and I know I can solve this cheese dilemma...once and for all!    PS:  Case in point...just check out the photo below...we need to help!"}
