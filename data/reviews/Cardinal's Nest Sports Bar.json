{"text":"Food is bland and just does not taste good. Bartenders only wait on you if your a young girl with tits. Otherwise you wait. Nightlife is terrible.... pushing almost fights every night. Will never go back. Oh i will say the inside is clean."}
{"text":"Went there for my Dad's birthday because they are supposed to be the \"Birthday\" place to eat....?   We were there at 6 pm on a Thursday and were pretty much the only diners in the place.  Waited at least 40 minutes for the 4 of us to get our food.     Food was ok, but wtf, did they have to kill the cow to make it????!   I can see why the place was dead as far as business.  I've heard the owner is moving on....   Maybe will be better then, as of now, would not go back...."}
{"text":"I actually want to give this place a better review.  I like local business.  I really would much rather spend my cash with a local business than some faceless chain restaurant, but this place needs some help.    It's clean, for a bar.  It's actually got a lot of space and some nice atmosphere, but the menu is disaster.  If your establishment can't make a decent burger, you're hurting.  I've been there three times.  Yesterday was my last straw.  I'm not going back until they fix the menu and get a chef who knows what he's doing.  First time: I had the BBQ cheeseburger.  It was okay.  There was nothing special.  Frozen patty, blah toppings.  It cost $7.99.  For an extra buck, you can go to Red Robin and get a far better burger.  Second time, I had the chicken teriyaki sandwich.  It was pretty bad.  The chicken had a lot of excess fat on it.  The teriyaki sauce was weak and flavorless.    Yesterday, went with the pulled pork sandwich and hashbrowns.  The hashbrowns were awful.  There was no flavor, even after I dumped salt and pepper on it.  It was like eating cardboard.  The pork was barely edible.  The BBQ sauce was too sweet and really didn't have any chutzpah.  The pork was as plain and cheap as pork could be.  It was very, very disappointing.  I'd give this place one star if it wasn't a local establishment trying to land a foothold on a Main Street area that could use more businesses.  They need to get a decent head chef and they need to establish a unique menu that is actually worth the money."}
