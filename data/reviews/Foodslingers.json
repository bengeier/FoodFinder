{"text":"One word ~ Rib eye. Yep you heard right, there steak and cheese sandwiches are made with fresh rib eye.   This is the best steak and cheese sandwich in Las Vegas right now. They use fresh rib eye meat and chop it up even more as they grill this glorious sandwich to perfection.   Things that make a great Philly:  1) good meat - well food slingers uses fresh rib eye so that is one of the best available meats for a Philly and it's always a nice portion of meat not to stingy.  2) Soft bread - There rolls are very soft and have just the right texture to enjoy this delicious treat. Not flaky at all.   I have had at least a dozen of these sandwiches and will continue to eat their Phillie's until a better shows itself in Las Vegas.  At $8 it's a good deal because your eating rib eye that is filled with plenty of flavor.   P.S. after typing this review my mouth started to water for one of their Philly cheese steaks.  That should help better understand just how good they are.    The Vegas Villain"}
{"text":"Hit the foodslingers truck on its first week in business. I order the Cheese steak with cheese whiz every time I hit the truck. The ribeye they use is fresh, not frozen and the portions are good. Outstanding flavor and freshness. On my second or third trip I tried the Hawaiian slinger. It had some kind of Hawaiian bbq teriyaki marinaded pork with some toppings. It was very flavorful but I have to admit, I prefer the cheese steak. All in all one of the better food trucks in Vegas"}
{"text":"This is a time I wish there were 1/2 stars, it was 2.5 star worthy. Had the Philly Cheeze Steak ($8). The bread was dry, but meat was tender and the cheese was nice and melty. However, overall, it was pretty unmemorable and hardly worth the wait."}
{"text":"rib eye burgers FTW!!!  i gave up meat a couple of years ago but i'd take it all back in a heartbeat for a hangover burger from foodslingers.  a rib eye patty topped with bacon, a fried egg and some other shit i can't remember. what i do remember is the drool dripping down the corner of my mouth as i watched the hubby devour it.  the folks on this truck work their tushies off so don't forget to tip them for all their hard work and dedication. we've known them to take on 3 events in one day and still serve us with friendliness and a smile."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this food truck at the Midweek Munch on Wednesdays at the El Cortez.  Super yummy!  My favorite is the philly tots - tater tots covered in grilled onions, peppers, and thin slices of beef.  They also offer a BBQ pork sandwich which is pretty darn good.  I can't wait to try their philly cheesesteak.  Everything tastes very fresh and the people running the truck are very nice.  Gonna be back soon!"}
