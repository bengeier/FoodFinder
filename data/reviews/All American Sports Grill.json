{"text":"OK...  Well I will boost ya back up a couple of notches as I just received a call from my pal telling me \"That all is good over at All American.\"  Apparently the owner was on top of my previous Yelp review and vowed that there will be two bartenders taking care of patrons from here on out on Saturday nights.  Like I said before, I'll be back.  I have always liked your place.  The view of the fountain, the TV's for sports buffs.  The friendly staff (especially Lauren) who knows more about rock and roll than most anybody I know...so I really would've missed you guys!    Glad that you jumped on it.  That's the way professionals do it.  See ya soon."}
{"text":"Food is ok service is crap rude waitress and bartender can't make drinks. I feel like people in Fountain Hills settle for this place because there is not much around. I recommend that you make the drive to Four Peaks instead."}
{"text":"We eat here regularly. Food is fresh. What an exciting environment! I wish they would add baked potatoes and more appetizers."}
{"text":"Disappointed today. This is usually a favorite. Wait for food was long, bottom of Reuben was soggy. And my husband didn't get 1000island dressing w his.  Great service and food when we've eaten there before. Don't know what was going on."}
{"text":"Terrible service! They were all talking about me and my sister behind my back we complained to the manager and he didn't do a thing just laughed it off. They never get our orders or drinks for 10 minutes. Terrible service pretty good food"}
{"text":"I live in the area and have been here many times.  The food and service has always been good in the past.  I am pretty disappointed with last night.  My wife and went down to relax a bit and listen to the music.  We sat at the bar, there were quite a few people at the time.  I was put off when the manager came by and barked at me to move my chair.  It was not the point but how she did it.  A little bit of tact and they probably would not have lost me as a customer.  The band was suppose to start at 8:30 and at 9:00 they were still setting up and it looked like it would take awhile.  The bar tender was very friendly.  I am only posting this in hopes they get the point and quit chasing people off."}
{"text":"We spent a lovely afternoon at the Fountain Hills Art and Crafts Festival and decided to extend the day and have dinner here. The location is beautiful with a patio that has a wonderful view of the fountain. Sadly, that's the best part of this restaurant. We started with a drink. I ordered a strawberry basil mojito, my go-to drink when I go out. This should have been my alert as to how the rest of the meal would go. The drink was completely lackluster, with no strawberry or basil flavor despite there being a few bits and pieces of each floating around in the glass. We ordered an appetizer of shrimp on charred corn which was good. And that's all that was good about the meal. For my main course I ordered their recommended chicken dish, Isabelle's Chicken and my husband ordered the Grand Slam Pizza.When the entrees were delivered to the table, the pizza looked like a frozen crust with some raw vegetables thrown atop it and tasted worse than it looked. When I cut into my chicken I discovered it was raw. Had I eaten it, it could have seriously killed me. I reported this to the waiter who apologized and asked if I wanted to order anything in its stead. At this point I simply wanted to leave, having completely lost my appetite. He brought the check and mentioned he took the chicken off the total. I would hope so! I was served raw chicken and (thankfully) ate none of it, so I would certainly expect I shouldn't have to pay for it! No manager ever came over with an apology or to let me know the kitchen staff was spoken to. A restaurant that can put out raw chicken is seriously putting their patrons at risk of illness. I will never eat at this restaurant again. Please check your food before you eat it if you choose to come here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this location is very beautiful. The food is always very tasty. We love that we can have our own person small speaker at our table at request to watch our game of choice. However, I feel that this is much overdue to say that we may not be back due to several occasions of a bartender that has been at this establishment for several years and has consistently had temper tantrums behind the bar at not only employees but even worse several customers who are just coming to enjoy a nice meal and some cocktails. It is not only uncomfortable for the guests but totally inappropriate and disrespectful to the establishment. Maybe some readjustments to bartenders should be made."}
{"text":"Interesting but I dropped in for a beer and food, sat at the bar and while they served me drink, no one in two hours asked if I wanted a menu.  The bar tenders were so busy cleaning up and trying to get out of there, they never came back to ask if I wanted anything.   Seriously, your job is to sell something.  On the other hand the jazz band was really really good.   Thanks for ignoring me..."}
{"text":"Called in 2 orders of wings I did one smoked and original, told him well well done ...!?! NOT...I can appreciate a bigger wing but dose it have to be all fat DISGUSTING skin ....Sucked... Wast of money...!!!I love to Patronize local establishment ..Not this place..... I have been here before was fine for Sports bar ...Quite over it ...=/"}
{"text":"First the good news: The food was very good. Thanks to the chefs! The bad news: 1. On our arrival this evening (first visit ever), we had just asked the receptionist about a table outside when she interrupted us and took a phone call which resulted in her taking a long order/reservation on the phone. We were abandoned. 2. Once we seated ourselves, we placed our meal order at the same time our drinks arrived. Then we waited .... 30 minutes!  3. My wife's salad was delivered without any dressing. 4. We received no apology from either the receptionist nor the server. We realize that things can get busy and hectic, but there is no reason for the indifference we received."}
{"text":"The bartender doesn't know how to properly mix drinks. Told me that a Tom Collins is made with vodka soda and sweet and sour when I sent the drink back and that I needed to specify to make it with gin. When she remade it with gin still tasted awful. Stick with beer so there isn't any mixing involved."}
{"text":"You know, this town is hard to do business in.  To be successful you have to really focus on the quality of the food and top notch service!  This place has missed the mark on both these items for me in two separate visits! The wait staff forgot 1/2 of our order.  So much of the food is frozen and deep fried, the other part is just blah...I ordered a salad, it was warm!   The produce used was very low quality and wasn't anything at all special.  I really want to go back, it's really the only local place to catch a game, but they have to step it up!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!  Four of us, including 2 kids. Ordered simple burgers, was over an hour before we got our food. Couldn't get any attention. No refills. Extremely disappointed. They had no problem dropping our bill before we finished, but failed to return our credit card and receipts in a timely manner.  Would NEVER return. As a local, that says a lot."}
{"text":"So this is the combination that I look for when I am on the road: Good service, decent food, and a good vibe. This place excelled in all three areas.  First the service was excellent. I sat at the bar and the bartender was very cute and attentive.  I asked about the menu and she gave some good insight. I chose  the Mediterranean chicken. She warned that it took at least a half hour to cook but it was well worth the wait. It was outstanding. Truly some of the best chicken I've ever had, although I don't order chicken often as I eat it at home a lot. This was not a regrettable choice for sure.  Lastly they have a bunch of good beers on tap and about 30 big screen tv's showing various sporting events. What more could a guy ask for?  Definitely a repeat customer."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times since moving to Fountain hills. The food is good and the service is usually pretty good. However, last night my husband and his friend went and when they were ignored for over 10 minutes, they went to sit at the bar in order to order some food.  My husband brought me a slice of plain cheesecake for dessert and I can honestly say, unfortunately it was the worst cheese cake I have ever had. I couldn't even finish it, which is a first for me.  A few months ago we tried the chocolate raspberry cheesecake and the raspberry flavor took over so it was not very good. One more suggestion if I may, the Cobb salads should probably be served on a bigger plate because the ingredients are stacked high and difficult to stir and eat on the narrow plate they are served on. Hopefully next time I go back there there are no more issues because I really like the place."}
{"text":"My buddy and I had just finished a 16-mile mountain bike ride in the area and were in search of a good lunch. We found this place in downtown Ftn Hills, next to the lake.  I'll make this quick and painless. Service was pretty good. Seemed like a great local place to go watch a game (TVs galor). We waited for 45 min. to an hour for our food (there was only 2 servers, but 3 bussers?), and it wasn't that crowded. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich, which was alright. Sandwich was a little smaller than I would've liked. Sweet potato fries rocked the house. I'd give them another chance to prove themselves."}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing special. They did forget to give salad dressing for my salad. Nice patio great view of park and fountain. This place is better for drinks only!"}
{"text":"Extremely dirty. Could have sworn I saw cockroaches running around. Smelled like sewer. However staff was really friendly."}
{"text":"Soup arrived cool and taste like it just came out of a can. Wife had $14 chicken sandwich that was uninspiring."}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday in the afternoon. We preferred to sit outside on the patio. What a view! Despite the road work, you have a sight line of the remarkable fountain across the street. We had the artichoke and spinach appetizer, Cajun Chicken pasta and Shrimp Fettuccini. All were amazing! Great service too. Very nice people, atmosphere and food. We will definitely become regulars!"}
{"text":"Good food and a wonderful view of the Fountain ... service is also very efficient A wonderful experience"}
{"text":"My Brother and I ate here while visiting our Dad in Fountain Hills...We loved it! Great food, great service and a fun atmosphere! I have to recommend the Mozzarella Caprese..."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I come here a lot because we are a young couple living in Fountain Hills and it happens to be 1 of the only semi \"hip\" places in the area.  Every time we go for happy hour and have Brad as our server, it is a great experience. However, if this place gets slammed at all, it can be a nightmare ESPECIALLY at lunch. We decided to go for lunch on Valentine's Day and it was completely packed. We were lucky enough to snag a table outside since it was pretty warm and stuffy inside the restaurant. Our food took over an hour, which we didn't really notice until the server came over to apologize, but after the third apology, we were ready to eat. My fiancé took 2 bites of his French Dip and noticed that the meat was fatty and tough. He told the server, sent it back and didn't want anything else. About 5 minutes later the server came back and said \"You were right. The chef checked the steak in the back and said it was yucky.\" Exact words. We weren't really mad or anything... we just thought that was a funny response. The server was nice and very apologetic. We will be back, of course, but if we walk in and notice any type of chaos, we'll probably decide to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. This place has gone all down the drain after their GM quit. They place has super high turnover and the food isn't good anymore. The staff used to be great but this year it's gone all to hell. You sometimes hear yelling, like the owner yelling at employees. The owners daughter dates clients that come in and when the client dumps her, she doesn't allow them to enter the restaurant again. I will never go back and neither will my any of my friends or their friends. It's typical bar food at best."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. So many big screen TVs for watching the games. Good food and wine list (in addition to the beers)."}
{"text":"I was in Fountain Hills for a few days and went several times. Food was very good and the prices were reasonable. Great view of the fountain from the porch. I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"This location is way better than the one in DC Ranch.  I love a good sports bar."}
{"text":"Food is ok... nothing to write home about. Better place to sit back and have a few cold ones."}
{"text":"LACEY THE MANAGER SHOULD BE FIRED! This woman has no business in the service industry. I ordered a vodka tonic and asked to send it back because it tasted of chlorine. My friends asked to try it before returning it and the waitress asked if they wanted it so they said yes. I got a beer instead. The food is just mediocre with overpriced small portions to boot. We ordered reubens with salads instead of fries. No salad dressing came with the salad so we waited an eternity for the dressing.  When the checks came, my friends were charged $8 for the vodka tonic the waitress had offered them. We were charged an extra $1.50 each for the salads even tho we didn't get the fries. We questioned our waitress and she referred us to her manager Lacey. We tried to explain that we misunderstood and thought the waitress was offering us the bad drink, not going to charge us for it. Lacey then tries the drink, says it does suck, but that she didn't make it and we should just \"stop bitching about it\"! When we questioned the upcharge for the salad instead of fries, she refused to take off that charge despite the very deceptive wording in the menu. She didn't budge on any of our complaints, only complaining herself several times about what a long hard weekend she'd had due to the art fair weekend. We are artists that show twice a year in fountain hills and spend plenty of money at this place each time we're in town bringing large parties to eat and drink there. Lacey could have easily made it right by taking that drink off the bill but instead, she's lost dozens of good paying customers as we will never go back there again and will spread the word amongst the artists that this place is seriously lacking in customer service as well as offering some seriously lack luster food."}
{"text":"Nice huge sports bar with plenty of T.V.s for football viewing.  We ordered two ice cold mugs of beer and cheese curds and smoked wings.  Curds were great.  The smoked wings were Awesome fall off the bone goodness with just the right amount of spiciness!  Service was great.  Too bad this bar is far from home."}
{"text":"Traditional menu but the OMG Chicken sandwich is to die for. Great service today by Allie. You've got to stop in."}
{"text":"Good until the snow birds are here. Good turkey burger and sweet potato fries. Seems to be short staffed once snow birds are gone. Took forever to get our food and when we asked the waitress if they were short staffed which caused the delay, she had this offended look and said no they're good. No apologies or any nicety! When we said it's never taken this long to get our food before, again no apology. Probably needs to be trained better being customer facing or maybe she was having a hard day. I would give this place a 2 but don't want to penalize for poor customer service by one person. And don't get their pastas, it's a burger place."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere! Just a couple blocks from the Brokers Alliance office."}
{"text":"Tell the long-haired blonde waitress to lose the plastic toothpick from her mouth and hands while she's setting tables!  Good alfredo though."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this local gem. Besides the gorgeous views of Fountain Hills Park and the mountains behind, the food is delicious and the service impeccable. Sit on the patio while enjoying an appetizer, salad, sandwich, or entree. Everything is wonderful (my favorites are the portobello mushroom appetizer and the Moroccan salmon). You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stopped there for dinner after a round of golf. Although the restaurant was busy we were able to grab a couple chairs at the bar. Friendly staff served a great meal. My friend had the salmon which she said was delish. I had the ribs which were tasty and meaty. Too cold to sit outside but the outside seating is a beautiful scenic place to sit and enjoy the fountain along with the majestic view of the Four Peaks. This place is a local favorite and I now know why."}
{"text":"Wow!  This was the BEST burger  I have had in Fountain Hills! Crazy good.  I got:  Wisconsin Cheese Curds - I've have better. They are good, but very very small compared to other places I've had them.  Cheese Pizza (adult menu- but for my son) - He gave it a 10! Said it's his new favorite.  Mushroom Bacon Burger (what I had) - I really have no words for how delicious this burger is.....was  I don't really understand the bad reviews for this place. Maybe they aren't ordering right? I'm a flight attendant, so I've had a ton of different burgers, and this one was absolutely perfect. It's HUGE, they cooked my meat the way I wanted. I did order NO ONIONS & they put them on (but easy fix right?). I also paid $1 extra for Blue cheese instead of Swiss (I also always think it's funny when you ask for no onion, no tomato, no Swiss- but then they charge you extra) but it was worth it. The garlic mayo on it is also very delicious. The bacon is crispy.  Not sure how much more detail I can go into. Thumbs up from us. We loved it. I'll order here again. We even ordered ours TO GO."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in town. Great food, great view and always top quality service!"}
{"text":"Chill atmosphere but business was sorta slow. 80's atmosphere blasting 80's music on jukebox. Food was ok. Average place. I may or may not come back."}
{"text":"This was our second time eating here. The first everyone was satisfied. This trip though not so much. I had the OMG chicken sandwich and it was not good. The ciabatta roll was like none I have had. It was more like a hot dog bun. :( The chicken was small and dry about the size of a meatball. The slaw to mayonnaise based and tasteless. The \"Spicy\" cilantro sauce was a joke no spice taste what so ever. My first fries came out cold and hard, I asked for a replacement and afterwards all the staff kept coming out and looking our way with smirks. What did they do to my fries? My husband food was also cold and the chips with his chili came out of a bag and were stale. UGH No more for us."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, lots of TV's!!! And a pleasure talking with Colten the bartender passionate guy about his career and restaurants very knowledgeable of beers and the food!! Chef driven menu with lots of vegetarian options for a sports bar themed restaurant. If you're in town or visiting like me it's worth the stop for a quick bite & a Brew!"}
{"text":"We had the chili and meat lovers pizza which were both pretty good. My wife did not like the pizza as much as I did which is odd considering I'm normally the pizza snob. The cheese on the chili was good, though she did add some siracha.  We came at a bad time as the place was packed and bartenders were struggling to keep up. Once the rush lifted a little we got better service.  The cocktails were plentiful and tasty as well. Clean bathrooms and tons of TVs. It was very buffalo wild wing vibe in a positive way. Of course on a nice day the outdoor seating is a good option."}
{"text":"This is one of the most consistently great places to eat in Fountain Hills. Not many places make it on my blog but the food is so good here that I wrote a blog about it on my website wwww.oneinlfuencer.com.  Yes it's that good.  If you want to get amazingly prepared food and have a view of the famous Fountain at the same time this is the place. I have ordered everything from the incredibly filling nachos, the salads, the Philly cheesesteak sandwich, their steak, Bananas Foster and to my always favorite go to...the salmon sandwich. I love this salmon sandwich so much that I order it every time I go in, which by my husband's count, it's a weekly event. It's moist, filling and the sweet potato fries make it just the right combination.  All I can say about this place is the owner of this establishment can teach a class to the other restauranteurs in Fountain Hills of what it's like to run a top notch restaurant with quality wait staff. The service is always on par, healthy amount of portions, totally worth the price tag and it's got a cool neighborhood ambiance. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"We live in the area and go to this place a few times every 6 months.  The service is really good.  The food is mostly typical bar food.  They could improve on their happy hour.  The view of the fountain is nice."}
{"text":"This is a very nice sports bar. My first time. Sat out on patio and enjoyed the beautiful scenery as well as the cozy patio. The food is cool. They have TVs on the patio.  It's really nice.  We will be back"}
{"text":"I honestly have to give it all 5!!! We came in on a Sumday afternoon after shooting a long you tube video just to get some lunch, we were starving! The girl at the fron greeted us and sat us where we asked to be, outside on the patio to oversee the fountain. The weather was amazing. Our waitress was sweet and greeted us with kindness and she was not annoying but very fast and efficient. We got our drinks right away and food came out fast. My All American burger was delicious, the meat medium well was perfect (I hate bloody meat). Overall great experience will definitely come here again!!! Fountain Hills is a small town so i think some of these mom and pop stores and restaurants are very friendly."}
{"text":"Went in during a staycation hoping to see the fountain. Unfortunately, it was too windy. Stayed for a couple of drinks and some coconut shrimp. Delicious. Service was adequate, but it is definitely a bonus to be a regular. The bar tender absolutely gave us an occasional glance, but all his friendliness was directed at a regular. Not the best way to create NEW regulars. I also made a statement to another bartender about the Moscow Mule she was making and having never seen one served anywhere I've been. She quickly made me feel very small with her lecture about how EVERYONE drinks them EVERYWHERE she has ever gone. Hmmm. Apparently, with all our traveling and dining out, we are going to the very few places that do not serve them ALL the time EVERYWHERE. Thanks, Princess."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and happy hour.   Food is good and service fair to good. One of the best in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"I know food flavor is a personal thing, but every burger I have had here is superb! The seasoning is always perfect, the service is likewise always perfect. This is now our favorite burger place in the valley. Kudos to the chef also!"}
{"text":"Been there a few times, staff is always pleasant and attentive. They have an awesome margarita and their food is consistently good."}
{"text":"The best hamburger ever, period! Along with great service! You have got to try their \"Happy Hour \""}
{"text":"Great place! Very clean and sporty. Great bar. Great food selection along with great food. And a nice atmosphere. There's also a nice outside patio where you can see the huge fountain in the pond across the street. I usually get the BBQ cheeseburger and it's always cooked perfect. Check it out if you haven't been!"}
{"text":"Great place!!!.. It has a fun atmosphere, lots of tvs and the food is definitely a step above the average sports bar.  Recommend."}
{"text":"Best service and the brownie skillet is top notch. Definitely right up there with BJ's signature pazookies."}
{"text":"I went during their $5 Happy Hour Menu so my dad and I were able to get a small pizza and a portobello mushroom for $10.00. I would say that's a great deal. The Margarita Pizza was delicious and the portobello has my Dad's vote. Since the location is just across from our \"World Famous Fountain\", the views are always spectacular.   I would give it a 5 for the overall experience, but the music was definitely too loud. Whereas I had to use an uncomfortable volume to communicate across the table. The food was good and so was the service, and especially for the price.   Cute waiters, too. ;-)"}
{"text":"We both had burgers. One had green chili and the other had bacon and sauteed mushrooms. The burgers were cooked well done as requested and contained some very good black angus beef. The onion rings ($1.50 upcharge) had the slight edge over the sweet potato fries. Only a few things were slightly wrong. garlic mayo - had no garlic taste bun - was crumbly and broke apart. hostess - told me she \"could not guarantee to put my game on\"  Hostess was like a teenager, so I dismissed the comment, but bartenders seemed clueless about how to switch channels. Eventually, it got worked out. Nice bar though with tons of seating and TV's, so without a huge number of choices in FH, this place seems to have the market cornered on good burgers."}
{"text":"Tried to get a job here. My husband is a firefighter right down the street so I thought maybe I could get a job as a bartender (because that's all I've ever done for the past 6 years) so we could be closer to each other and relocate closer to where we both work. The bar manager refused to see me after I made the trip from San tan valley on 4 different occasions trying to catch her when I was told she would be in. I tried consistently to meet with her. I called on a Sunday, after being turned away the 4 times I made an appearance, which was my only day off from my other job and she told me it was football Sunday and there's nothing she could do for me now but to call back. So I did a few days later. She refused to even talk with me. Like I was inconveniencing her by trying to give my time to work there. The hostess answered and when I asked if I could speak with the bar manager, she said hold on let me get her. The hostess comes back on the phone 5 minutes later only to tell me, yea the bar manager said we are not hiring right now... oh ok, then why wouldn't she tell me that when she spoke with me on the phone the first time I called? Incompetent and unprofessional. The guy bartender that usually works nights that wears a hat (the few times I've seen him he was wearing a hat) has always been very nice and welcoming every time I've come in in the past and the food and the views are spectacular. But the bar manager could use some training on how to be a courteous and professional leader. Maybe that bartender should take her place! He was much more helpful than she was the whole time I tried to apply. She couldn't even talk to me on the phone without coming off as rude and annoyed. I wonder how she talks to customers, as I was also a paying customer before applying..."}
{"text":"Great happy hour food.   Best burgers around.  Chicken wings and Margarita pizza are good options as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good for bar food. I had the phili cheesesteak with a house salad \"upgrade\". My guest had the French dip with sweet potato fries and an additional side of cole slaw. One ice tea and one soda, with tip, $50.00 bucks.  So. Bring your wallet!    The patio in front of the fountain is where we were to avoid the noisy bar. Unfortunately, the patio was just as noisy.   For the prices, I wish the servers were quicker with the refills while also not making us feel rushed. The place wasn't that crowded.  For those reasons, I took a star off..."}
{"text":"Meh.  Wished it was better.  Their ribs were great, but every side was needing some more help!  Who doesn't have baked potatoes for dinner when you are eating some BBQ?  We settled for a side salad (limp white lettuce with random veggies and watery dressing) and onion rings, which were good.    All in all I guess we were mildly happy.  Just wish restaurants that go the extra mile and smoke ribs for hours upon hours would put more thought into what's finishing off the plate!"}
{"text":"This place is great.  Service is always solid with Julian, Lauren and Tanya.  The Kitchen turns out great food at a good value and always remembers you by name.  My kids insist on having lunch here on the weekends.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"I have been in and every time I order a medium burger it comes out well done. I then send it back. My fries and onion rings come out warm not hot. Usually good service. Have had the wings and they are really good."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and welcoming.  We got seated and  our order was taken quickly.  The best seats seem to be the outside patio seats with the beautiful view !  I ordered a wedge salad which was huge! fresh ,delicious and enough for 3 people.  My husband and I shared it. I ordered the slider appetizers. I enjoyed the soft slider rolls they came and the grilled onions.  My husband who is  a huge hamburger lover said  his hamburger was okay.  +"}
{"text":"The peppers appetizer is awesome and totally different! I had the macaroni and cheese with bacon and jalapeños and my hubby had the wings! Both were fantastic! The grapefruit majito is FANTASTIC! Great patio view and the weather was amazing! I will definitely come here when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Meh...We stopped in for a drink on a gloomy day. Waitress was super nice. Wine glass had lipstick on it. Iced tea glass was sticky. Wine was repoured right away. We might come back and try the food. They need to work on cleaning the glasses."}
{"text":"Awesome, fun place!!!  Definitely try the tortilla chip trio!  Best chips EVER and awesome guacamole!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick dinner to close out our AZ trip. Cool space, but a  little loud. Can't imagine what it would be like once the bad started to play. Why do restaurants insist on live music in the dining room?  Anyway, had both the buffalo & smoked wings to start. Pretty good - loved the fall off the bone smokes wings. I had the pulled pork sandwich. Not the best BBQ I've ever head, but certainly not the worst.  Service was decent and we were in and out of there pretty quickly. Not much else to say. Pretty good place and did its job."}
{"text":"Descent bar food great wings unfortunately completely useless for takeout. Would be great to order there wings for party's or take out but the waitstaff has screwed up my orders 3x."}
{"text":"Great food. Great prices. Great view from patio. Manhatten was perfect. Alicia our server was awesome. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is very loud inside. They have TVs in all the right places though so if you are going for sports watching it's a great spot.  The food is lacking though. Very bland and nothing that I've tried in the multiple times I've been stands out as anything worth going back for. The service is great if it isn't a busy game night.  I've had everything from salads to burger/sliders and it's all run of the mill bar grub."}
{"text":"No visit to Fountain Hills ( we visit a couple times a year) is complete without coming here at least once. The menu is excellent....OMG Sandwich and everything I have tried is worth ordering again. The atmosphere itself is great, whether sitting on the patio enjoying the park/fountain or watching one of the many games on TV. We typically spend a few hours just enjoying the sunshine on the patio and a couple pitchers with lunch."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of sports bars, especially when there is a popular event in progress but this one has my vote. It is kid friendly, has very good food and the wait staff is top notch. They have a good menu selection of both food and beers. The homemade soups are great offering both a soup of the day and a Dave's Famous Chili which is as good as it gets. The kids menu has depth to it - not just two or three items.  There is outside seating where the noise during a game is reduced to the level that conversation can be normal. Seating inside and out is spacious and the prices are moderate."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Went here two days in a row for dinner. Ordered a steak sandwich with sweet potato fries the first time, second time ordered the OMG Chicken (no cheese) with sweet potato fries the next day as well as mussels and coconut shrimp for an appetizer. The mussels are enough for two people, wish they had more coconut shrimp in the order but overall very delicious and great service."}
{"text":"We live in fountain hills, and our favorite place to go. We sit at the bar but when people are in town, and get a table, the service is slow. Went to their DC ranch location and got their OMG chicken sandwich. No where near the same!! We were so disappointed! Food not the same!  Don't put the same veggies in and sauce not the same! We will stick with ASG here in town. You ROCK!!"}
{"text":"Went there after walking around the Fountain Hills Fair....the place was packed, but after being seated, our server was quick to greet us, and got us drinks right away! And then took our order. The time to get our food didn't take long at all, considering the crowed. Was very impressed with the service, and the friendliness of the staff! The food was really good, one of the best burgers I have had in a long time. Homemade cole slaw, and onion rings were exceptional. Prices were very fair for the quality of the food. Pretty close to a \"5\" star rating!!!"}
{"text":"Good food and a great selection.  It's a little loud, but that's what to expect from a sports place!  The team there is friendly and prompt.  I haven't had a meal I didn't like."}
{"text":"A friend in town invited us out and asked us to give then another try. Glad we did.  Many of the issues we had before have been fixed.  The food is better, the drinks are good. The staff are present and professional.    Glad we gave then another try."}
{"text":"Just Ok The food was just ok and seemed basic.  We came in after doing a mud run and the burgers were just ok.  We also ordered a pizza but it seemed like it was frozen before hand.  The view and location is very nice no doubt about that.  The service was alright (on the menu it says there is a 18% gratuity added to every check, not sure what that's all about).  All and all, there isn't anything that wows, just the location."}
{"text":"Who knew couscous could be so good! Love the Moroccan Salmon. Great view of the fountain."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoy our visits to this grill. The bar staff, Julian, Coltan and Lauren are super friendly and make us feel like one of the locals (we are snowbirds). Great menu; our favs are the mussels, coconut shrimp and the ribs......meat just falls off the bone. They have a good selection of beers, wines and cocktails. We like to sit at the bar and chat wth the locals.....great people!"}
{"text":"I had poor service, the chili was so dry it was like eating paste.  Service was poor, had to ask for the check...won't go back."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! What a view from the patio.Look forward to coming back and checking out the live music!"}
{"text":"As a long-time resident of Fountain Hills and of Arizona, I have seen a ton of restaurants come and go - especially in Fountain Hills. I have been to All American so many times I should weigh about 1,000 pounds by now. This is a family owned and run business so the owners are almost always on site to make sure the customers are well served.  During the day, this place is great for lunch or time-out on the patio when the weather is good. During the happy hour, the place starts to get busy. The food and drink specials during that time can;t be beat. At night, there is even more activity and on most weekends, there is live music.   No matter when you come by, you will always find an abundance of TVs with the current sporting events, sports or news feeds or maybe some other shows of interest. These guys must have an incredible DirecTV bill each month. They have the Hear TV app enabled TVs so you can always use your Smart Phone to listen in on your favorite monitor or they have he Sound Dog audio boxes.  The view to the Fountain is the best in town whether you are at a table inside near a door or window or on the patio. The Fountain goes off every hour on the hour unless it is a windy day or some special town event changes the schedule.  The food at this place is a notch above most other sports bars. They try and make everything fresh and to you order. This sometimes makes the wait for your food a little longer than some other places, but it is worth it. The pricing is a little higher than some, but the food quality well makes up for that.  Some of my favorite dishes are the OMG Chicken, the Morrocan Salmon, the Chicken Tenders, the Sliders and the Wings.  Service is always great here and if you let your servers know you are in a hurry they will do everything in their powers to make sure you get the quickest service available.  I have never been disappointed here with the food, service, views or experience. Try it out, I'm sure you will agree."}
{"text":"Very good sports bar with lots of tv's, good beer selection and excellent food. In fact, the food is crazy good. The downside is the service. If you're not a regular you have to beg to get anyone's attention. But still worth the visit."}
{"text":"The new Market Street location in DC Ranch needs a lot of work.  We joined our friends here for dinner this week.  I ordered the OMG chicken sandwich. It was very basic and tasted bitter and the chicken was dry and very small breast of chicken.  My son had the cheeseburger and it was so dry it couldn't be rescued.  Here's the worst of it;  my friend ordered the Rodney Strong \"cab\".  The waitress brought out another bottle and failed to show it to us.  Just went about her merry way uncorking the bottle and pouring.  The bottle was a $69 bottle.  Not the $35 bottle we ordered.  Guess what?  This place refused to make it right.  After pointing out what the waitress did wrong, she talked to her manager (he refused to come to our table despite being asked to do so).  They ended up giving us a $10 discount.  Wahoo!   Guess what?  We won't ever go back.  There are far too many burger and brew joints that value our business.  This place is going to suffer."}
{"text":"3 stars for view and location because it really is a gorgeous view of the fountain and the wrap around patio is perfect when the weather is nice. The service was satisfactory but the food was... sub par to say the least. I should premise: we are vegetarians so ordered the veggie burger and some sides. The veggie burger was a store bought dry patty and the bread was all dry. Bland dry sand which... No sauce. It cost as much as a meat entrée so I'd hope they could put a bit more creativity and flavor into the burger. I'm grateful for the vegetarian options restaurants are providing but I hope they improve their recipes and put as much effort as they'd put into their other entrees. I wouldn't spend my money here again, unless it was just for a beer."}
{"text":"I just stopped in with my brother for lunch and had the Mushroom Bacon Burger, it was delicious, although pretty big (1/2 pound). Sat out on the patio with view of Fountain Park. Great service, food and view. Inside had lots of TV's."}
{"text":"Always have a good time coming to this place with my family. They accommodate to every sports fan by having a ton of TVs and sound boxes that you can hear any TV on. They have awesome Happy Hour prices and their margarita pizza and buffalo chicken sandwich are great! There aren't many place in FH but if you are in town, this is a great casual place to go!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food with fair prices.  Fun atmosphere. Lauren the bartender is awesome. Brad the waiter rocks.Nice atmosphere with a pretty patio that overlooks the fountain. Overall a nice experience. They typically have some live music on the weekends which can be pretty loud inside but you can hear it from outside too."}
{"text":"Great meal! Wonderful atmosphere and great service. Thank you! Morrocan Salmon with isreali couscous... Awesome!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in Fountain Hills and overlooks the water and the fountain.  You're not close enough to get splashed (it's across the street) but you can see it very well.  The fountain is in an artificial body of water and every so often it spouts up into the air.  There is seating on the patio of the restaurant which I highly recommend in good weather.  They have a nice variety on the menu and everything sounds good.  There were three of us and each had something quite wonderful.  I had the mediterranean-spiced chicken and it tasted great.  It came with mashed potatoes.  The chicken was very tender.  One of us had the pork tenderloin and the other had the baby ribs.  We all thought our meal was great.  We were disappointed that the waitress brought the bill instead of asking if we wanted dessert (not that we really needed it) but other than that the meal was very good."}
{"text":"OMG Chicken sandwich was incredible. Service from Mark was equally impressive. I love the atmosphere at All American and the view of the famous Fountain across the street is beautiful."}
{"text":"Service was good prices were reasonable but it was seriously hot In there, for 118 temperature. We asked about air-conditioning, the manager said they are working on it, they weren't expecting the heat. I challenged them and said this had been predicted for a week, and they said they're working on the AC tonight but the AC can't keep up with it, so there's nothing we can do about it. I said yes buy new ACs. Rude, unprofessional,liars in management. Don't go in summer!"}
{"text":"First time here and I live in town.  Was there for tapas one night but that is about it.  Pretty popular place, staff was good.  I had a delicious greek wrap and fries.  The wrap was flavorful and the fries crisp and hot.  Kept glasses full.  Price was good as well.  Would go again.  Sat outside on the patio, it was a beautiful day and when the fountain went off got a huge blast of cool air.  that was NICE!"}
{"text":"The service somedays has a lot to be desired, but you can't miss the location and the food is quite respectable"}
{"text":"Sorry to say this place is disgusting.  I had the caprese salad, which was fine and the margarita pizza which was meh...   My fiancé had the Philly Cheese Steak and it was terrible!  He took two bites and couldn't eat the rest.  I took one just to confirm.  Ick!    The view of the fountain would be nice if it wasn't obstructed by the huge metal fence that bordering the patio.    Staff was pleasant and we were seated and served quickly.  Other then that I don't know how this place stays open with returning customers.  I would definitely not recommend going here."}
{"text":"What a fun sports bar right across from the world famous Fountain in Fountain Hills. This place has awesome old school photos of different sports figures. Who doesn't love an old school photo of Dick Butkus from the Bears.  (Yes I know my football.)  I was a little sad not to see a photo  of my Boy Terry Bradshaw from the Steelers.   Cool decor and awesome music. If you want to listen to 80'a music and sing along come here. I was having a blast singing along while I ate. Or playing name that tune. Who doesn't love the Bangles or Tiffany!   The food is pretty good I went with the Pulled Pork Sandwich with no onions. My BF had the Mushroom Burger also with no onions. The bar offers a large variety of drinks and beers. The view is fantastic because it overlooks the Fountain and its grounds. Staff is very pleasant and knows a lot of the regulars. This is also a big hang out for the American Legion which is awesome."}
{"text":"The sign said it was open called they said it was open we got there they said it was closed don't come here with those business ethics, wasting my valuable time"}
{"text":"We LOVED the wings! We did a half order (5) BBQ. They were crispy, saucy and meaty!! We'd definitely order them again  Hubs had the Mushroom Bacon Burger. When you go out for a burger - THAT'S what it should taste like! Open flame grilled to perfection!! I had steak salad. Steak was perfect rare, tender and tasty. Beers were ice cold and everything was served very quickly! Great place to watch a game- plenty of tv's easy to see, no matter where you sit.  It smells like the p-traps need a good rinse, and the AC was struggling - but we will be back!! Food and service were spot on"}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in Fountain Hills, the hamburgers are out of this world at a very good price.  In downtown Fountain Hills with a great view of the fountain."}
{"text":"Have returned here a few times now and the food is really good..not your usual sports bar food. We love the shashito peppers, Cobb salad, burgers, omg chicken. Very good service too and $5 weekend bloody Mary's are great!"}
{"text":"I was sad when I saw Yelp removed my original review of this fabulous restaurant. It is so yummy, good, that I want everyone to know. Fresh, flavorful food in an easygoing relaxed environment with a great view of the fountain. One of the best restaurants in Fountain Hills for sure. Great wait staff and there's even rockin' entertainment on the weekends!"}
{"text":"The place is nice. The servers are friendly. My Sonora Dog was a bit over cooked, and skimpy in the bacon , but was still good. The salsa tasted homemade and fresh.  My biggest concern was the St Pauli Girl beer....They should make it more clear that it's non-alcoholic. I admit I saw the St Pauli Girl NA name on the import list thought NA meant North America because despite St Pauli's birthplace in Germany, it is brewed and bottled solely for North America. (it is not sold in Germany, nor known by many Germans)  Please revise your menu and segregate all non-alcoholic brews from the rest.  Also, why not carry real St Pauli Girl?"}
{"text":"Great food and love the outdoor patio. WISCONSIN cheese curds were fabulous, and the buffalo chicken sandwich and pepperoni pizza were both great! Love that you can watch the fountain while enjoying the meal outdoors."}
{"text":"Ok, food ok, service poor. This place is more for a beer than a meal."}
{"text":"Haven't been there in 6 months - now I remember why.  Unfriendly waiter.  Food was good but we were made to feel as though we were bothering the waiter - and the place was empty.  Think his name was Donald?  The gal at the front door was very friendly when we left."}
{"text":"Worked in Phoenix this week and searched for the nearest place to find good food. Of course I pulled up Yelp to see what was buzzing in the area and stumbled upon All American Sports Grill.  My colleague and I decided to check it out and we were not disappointed!!  Unbeknownst to us, we arrived during happy hour and wow... the $5 menu is incredible! Not only is it a bargain, but the food was delicious! We ordered the caprese salad, soppressata, blackened salmon salad, and hot wings. Every item, ever bite was tasty and delicious!!  We dined outdoors on the patio with a view of the golf course/walking trail. It was splendid. The staff was great, food was delicious, and the ambiance is pretty cool!!"}
{"text":"A clean fun bar atmosphere. Lots of TVs and sports!! The food is pretty fresh and light. Of course mixed with traditional bar food. A great place to grab a beer and chill."}
{"text":"Food was not bad, but automatic, 18% tip was not appreciated. Not sure if tip was just gouging because of Art Festival outside doors or if 18% is their standard but they will not have any more visits from the 5 of us."}
{"text":"Good food and great views.  We shared mussels, appetizer and caesar salad."}
{"text":"Great outdoor seating and view of the fountain! Friendly service and the food was a little above average."}
{"text":"I have been to All American several times. It's a regular spot for lots of Fountain Hills folks. The vibe is always great, excellent place to watch a game. Always upbeat and fun.   Prices are so so. A little overpriced for a sports bar for my taste. Food is pretty good - burgers, pasta, pizza, etc. Their margaritas are fantastic though, I recommend getting it if you're having a cocktail (and it's their cheapest so win win!).  If you can, sit outside! The patio boasts a wonderful view of the fountain and park. They have heaters so even if it is a little chilly, you'll be fine!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am never disappointed. The service is fantastic, and the gentleman in charge always makes sure everybody is taken care of. They have great drinks, and the best French dip sandwiches I have ever had. If you are visiting for the winter, or are just a local who has never been here, I would definitely recommend you try this place out.  Price point is medium. Food is worth it!"}
{"text":"Hmm - where do I start? I wish we could give 1/2 stars on these reviews, as I believe AASG would be a solid 2.5 IMO.   I feel a little guilty giving them lower stars, since they're a local business in my 'hood, but I gots to be honest, right?  This restaurant/bar isn't \"bad\" per se, it just is \"so so\". You can't really go wrong by playing it safe and ordering any type of salad from here. Or, burgers. Ribs were pretty disappointing - dry as all holy hell.   Also, they may want to consider using lemon wedges in their water. Like a LOT. Or, investing in some type of water treatment system. Why? Because I thought I was drinking a refreshing room temperature glass of weak chlorine!! Gross. Or, they could consider using bottled water over tap.  On a lighter note, this place has a great sport vibe to it and GREAT view of the fountain/pond. Especially nice during warmer months - great patio area."}
{"text":"It's very pricey for food and drinks. Unfortunately everytime I leave there I'm $70 less rich. Lol but it does have a good atmosphere which I like :)"}
{"text":"Good outdoor seating with a clear view of the fountain. Excellent place to chill out for 1-2 hours, grab a drink and an appetizer and chill."}
{"text":"This has, ever since it opened, been the busiest place in town, that's a bar/grill.  The food is always very good and consistently so.  The waiters and bartenders have mostly all been there for sometime. That speaks for itself.  Just an oasis in this small town."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a late afternoon Saturday,(more parking in back)got in just in time to get a booth. It filled up fast after we sat & got our wing order in. Lots to choose from on the menu, good array from salads to sandwiches & entrees. The smoked wings were tasty, but I would have preferred abit more crispy...skins were a little slime-y. Placed our meal order and seemed to be delayed  by the influx of customers that came in. Philly-cheese steak was OK, nothing I'd write home about. The burgers were 1/2 lb, nicely cooked and tasty, so Hubby was pleased.You can build your burger, to an extent. Not a fan of the cold slaw.. it wasn't cold, : ) Although,we will be back, service was good till they got busy, so we will try another time to visit & stay longer."}
{"text":"Super Sports Bar. Nice outdoor seating with great fountain views. Lots of TVs and sound boxes. The griddle cookie is outstanding. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"My in-laws discovered this place and invited my husband and me for Happy Hour. We arrived about 5:30pm on a week night and since the weather was still nice, we sat outside on the patio. We did this with the great intention of watching the fountain that goes off at specific times.   The happy hour menu has quite a few food items and drink specials. As I was on a Moscow Mule kick, I ordered the Mule. My husband went with a margarita. Since I wasn't too hungry, I ordered the Margarita pizza off the Happy Hour menu. This was a personal sized pizza - more or less 8\" in diameter and cut into four pieces. It wasn't the best pizza I've ever ate and reminded me of a frozen pizza, but it wasn't terrible. My husband ordered the burger with fries. I stole a fry and they were mediocre, but no complaints from him.   Overall, there wasn't anything that really stood out as amazing. Just your typical sports bar/grill. The food was mediocre and the drinks were typical. Our waitress was nice and attentive, so that's the only real draw. I wouldn't drive 30+ minutes to visit this place, but if in the area, it isn't a bad stop."}
{"text":"4 stars because the smoked wings were excellent and the beer was cold. Cool place good view. Coconut shrimp were less than good, overcooked . I'd go again."}
{"text":"For a Thursday night, this place was packed. This place has lots of TV screens all over the establishment. Your at a sports restaurant and the noise level was pretty loud. I had the buffalo chicken burger with fries and my wife had the steak sandwich with cole slaw. The cole slaw is just how I like it, not too wet. Both dishes tasted great, chicken wasn't dry but the chicken could have been pounded thinner. The steak could have been sliced smaller so that it could have been eaten easier. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"The food is decent but the atmosphere is good. Lots of TVs and plenty of selection if you go there for sports. The service is usually quite good. If you are going there for an outstanding food experience, you might want to think twice."}
{"text":"First restaurant that I've tried in Fountain Hills. Cool place with good food and service. Wide area of drinks. Has a dark interior with an aesthetic that kinda reminds me of the inside of a pirate ship."}
{"text":"Sat on the patio with a lake view. Beautifull view and food was not a disappointment either. We ate burgers. I had the californian hubby had the one with grilled onions. Both delicious."}
{"text":"Just had omg chicken. That is the name for it, and omg it was amazing. It is a grilled chicken breast with a spicy cilantro honey pesto, jalapeño jack cheese over napa cabbage slaw on ciabatta bread"}
{"text":"Walked in and sat at high top. Server gave us drink menu and we asked about the margaritas which were first on the list of drinks. Server said the house margs suck. Interesting way to start the order."}
{"text":"I want to say that I went for my 3rd, maybe 4th, time today. The hubs and I went for a late lunch, a friend was at the bar so he joined us and finished his cheeseburger with us.  Both the hubs and I ordered burgers - mine was the one with the avocado and red pepper (I believe that it's called the California Burger) and my hubby had the All American Burger. We both ordered Medium Rare. Mine was pretty darned close to Medium Rare, not perfect but not too far off. Overall the burger was good (Scott said the same about his).  A menu pet peeve of mine is that you read the list of burger toppings and they don't list onions, so you assume that onions aren't on the burger.... yet, they are. I realize that this is picky, but I HATE taking them off and setting them to the side. I simply hate the smell of the onions sitting on the table it's so unappetizing to me. And, you guessed it, the burger had the red onions on it.  I've had people complain to me about the prices here. Honestly, I don't think that they are that bad. I'm sure that the Landlords jack up the rent since there is so much vacancy, but that's just a guess. There are plenty of TVs to entertain you, all sorts of sportsball for you to check out at one time. The view of the fountain is always fabulous. And, for me, the place is walking distance from my house - to me, that rocks.  The staff needs a little bit of customer service training. They are always nice. Just never quite attentive enough. OH, and taking my empty glass of soda to refill and bring back is NEVER acceptable in my book. Another restaurant pet peeve of mine."}
{"text":"Here's the scene: Spending the week with the grandparents in Fountain Hills. Rental car's been returned. And the Packers game isn't on TV.   Jumped on Yelp and found this place just a few blocks away, and the day is saved! The hostess seemed like she was in a really bad mood, but besides that, we had a good time being able to watch the game and grab some lunch. The spinach dip was slightly disappointing, too much feta and not enough artichoke if you ask me. But the buffalo chicken wrap was great, as was the pepperoni pizza (after two napkins worth of grease were sopped up...). Our server, Emiliano, was great, keeping our drinks full and not rushing us out the door when we were done with our food. The patio was really nice, it was a beautiful breezy day, so we enjoyed sitting outside while getting our football fix."}
{"text":"I keep coming here and giving it another chance but each time I end up disappointed. Tonight was the nail in coffin for my dining at this place. Starting with the undercooked pasta in the Mac and cheese, on to my salmon dish which was probably the most bland dish I have had since moving to Arizona. Seriously thought I was eating cardboard. Spinach was undercooked and doused in tasteless oil. Even the potato's entirely bland. How do you mess up potatoes? I Am done with this location. Save your money and go into scottsdale for some decent grub."}
{"text":"Went.in friday night by saturday morning I coulnt get out of bed from food poisoning. Both my aunt and cousin got sick as well. Stay away from this place. Dirty place."}
{"text":"We just returned from the grill. We go there once a month or so because we live in Ft. Hills. I don't understand why the people that work they want to be rude. We are customers willing to spend money, smile and be good customers. The tall blonde lady is mean, the short blonde lady could not have been bothered with us, she must have walked past us 20 different times and never once bothered to ask if we wanted anything. I don't understand rudeness in a service business. Totally unnecessary. When workers smile and welcome customers, they will come back. When the are mean and ignore the customer , well we might as well just stay home. Sad."}
{"text":"Alright Loves... with this place it's either you love it or hate it. Sadly, I'm in between. I've gone here before with family and it's a blast, but if your not a part of a huge party you will not get served as well. I had a waiter who would not fill up my water for about 20 minutes. The food is okay but it's not the best either.   Apparetly to this place, a bigger party is more important that a couple, which doesn't help their creadbility."}
{"text":"Even though \"sports bars\" are not usually my favorites, we love this place! Great service, delicious food (my fav is Cobb salad and their summer kiwi martini). Love the patio with mountain, park and fountain views. We often arrange to meet our Fountain Hills and our Scottsdale Homestore clients on the patio when the weather is perfect from October-may."}
{"text":"Best smoked wings. Double pour drinks double price. Flat breads good; pizza so so ; staff friendly Open latest food place in sleepy fountain hills"}
{"text":"Florentine Pizza is excellent. Lots of spinach and flavor. Great value for $8.50.  Danielle is a weak link bartender."}
{"text":"Shout out to adam at all American. Bartender/ waiter. Me and my friends were being roudy and he put up with us. He was very friendly the whole time and very courteous. Great service. Great food. Will recommend to friend and be back saturday!"}
{"text":"While attending a conference at the nearby Fort McDowell Resort, we wandered over to downtown Fountain Hills. There is a nice collection of shops and restaurants here and as our original destination, the Water's Edge Restaurant, was \"seasonally closed\" as the sign on the door informed us, we looked for another candidate for dinner.  One block down, we discovered this corner sports bar on the first floor of a generic office building.  Sports bars are generally not my first choice when I'm seeking out a quality meal, so we decided to have a gander at the menu before taking a seat. The bill of fare (including beer and wine selections) fills both sides of a sheet, which for me is an encouraging sign that the chef is focused on producing a delicious product. Too often restaurants disappoint by overpromising and underdelivering with a laundry list of offerings that ultimately are mediocre, freshly defrosted imitations of authentic dishes.  All American is a comfortable and casual spot for a drink or two and a nice meal. The restaurant occupies the site of the former Overtime Sports Grille, with a new owner and menu. The menu features typical pub grub, sandwiches and pizza, along with several enticing dinner entrees including fish and fowl. We opted for some Wisconsin cheese curds to start, followed by grilled filet and a cobb salad. The curds weren't very impressive (my dining companion being a genuine cheesehead from the Dairy State, I have a credible expert to evaluate them), served piping hot but little else to recommend them.  Dinner entrees were surprisingly good. The two filets (4-6 oz each) on plate were cooked almost perfectly, slightly overdone yet they were very tender and flavorful with a competent demi-glace icing each. The steak crowned a bed of large, sweet tender asparagus spears, carefully prepared to give a satisfying gentle crunch. A small caesar side-salad wasn't particularly remarkable except for the light dressing, which was made in-house and was quite tasty. The cobb salad had a interesting presentation, with the components laid out in parallel rows across an oval platter. It was a very generous portion and the bleu cheese dressing was freshly prepared.  Service here is friendly and fairy attentive, with frequent checks on drinks. There were a couple of miscues (forgot to give the kitchen the appetizer order, side salad for steaks served with the entree) but nothing unforgiveable.  For entertainment you can watch one of the nearly three dozen HD monitors scattered overhead, or check out the town's amazing namesake water fountain through the large picture windows on the front of the restaurant. As it turns out, the fountain is the world's second largest, its enormous 500-horsepower pumps capable of shooting a stream 560 feet into the desert air.  I was pleasantly surprised by All American. I enjoyed my visit very much and judging by the many immaculate plates left by other diners, they did as well. It's definitely worth a try if you're looking for a cozy place to unwind or take in a ball game while enjoying some good food and drink."}
{"text":"went here tonight and sat on the patio overlooking the fountain and the mountains.  It was very nice and relaxing.  First time we have been here and were impressed.  Our waiter Bradley was awesome.  We had the Asian chicken salad which my dad loves, cup of tomato & spinach soup which was great.  The macaroni & cheese was gluten free and flavored nicely and I loved the grilled asparagus... I have an allergy to nickel and can not eat certain foods and they were able to accommodate my allergies and substitute foods without any added charges...The cheesecake is made in house with only 5 ingredients the way it should be...we will return again...great service and really good food, sit on the patio at dusk and you can not beat the views.."}
{"text":"Overall it has a good selection of traditional American food with some hints of other great styles.  The best part is they are open late.  The only place in town if you want to sit down after 9pm and get good food!  Lots of TVs - great for sports enthusiasts."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and through out all the ownership changes. Service is good, food is good, drinks are cold, staff is nice, great patio view, and live music on the weekends. I mean what else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"The first time I ate here, service was okay, food was okay.  I was  in town again last night and because it is walking distance to my hotel thought I would try it again.  Well, never again.  My two friends and I approached the hostess and asked if they served steak and potatoes.  The hostess never spoke to us and summoned the manager.  The manager told us we looked tipsy.  We were dressed appropriately.  We were not loud, staggering, laughing, swearing.  We are in our 50s and yes, we were tipsy but we didn't ask for a bottle of tequila and lime to go.  We wanted to sit down and eat.  The manager pointed to several other nearby restaurants and dismissed us.  I accept that you have the right to refuse service to anyone.    I just do not understand why you would not serve us food.  I will never go back to this restaurant and point people in another direction if they ask my opinion.  We had a very pleasant quiet meal with a delightful waitress in another location."}
{"text":"Food hit the spot. Good for a bar. Service was a bit slow but we think it was because they were short staffed for the lunch rush. Drinks were great and refreshing. Our waiter was friendly, helpful, and nice. Would come back if we were in the area."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant bar you would only order beer. We got sick from eating lunch and their staff were not courtesy and wait for our table more than half hour as we were right by the front of check in and they thought we miss the call.  This restaurant needs have kitchen be inspected by the state."}
{"text":"Onion ring was burned. 5 pieces coconut shrimp for $10.95?? Burger bun was old.  Bartender charge orange juice for my shock top beer."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times it was just okay.  The first time we came was on a beautiful afternoon. All we wanted was a snack since something was already cooking at home. We decided on the nachos. Were they amazing? No, but we still enjoyed it.   The next and most likely last time we went was for dinner. The girls up front were frazzled from how many people were there, that they were forgetting about people who asked for a table. At that point, I knew we weren't going to receive exceptional service. Finally, we were sat down. It took our waiter over ten mins to greet us. Ten minutes after that is when he gave us our drinks only to leave us before letting us place our order. At that point, I just wanted to eat and leave. Almost ten minutes later, he came back and took our order. Our food came out a bit cold. It wasn't amazing once again. For the prices, you would think it would be amazing, but it wasn't. The food was subpar and the customer service well, no where near extraordinary."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and liked the positive comments on the chicken sandwich so I ordered one to go. I specifically asked what kind of bread it was on and they said chuabata and that sounded good to me.  They said 15 to 20 min.  I showed up about 20 later and they said it will be right out. 15 min later it came out, no problem.  Problem is when I got home for $10.85 I got a 3 oz beast on a soft hamburger bun. Won't do that again !"}
{"text":"This place is in fact a sports bar however the menu would seem otherwise very interesting and somewhat eclectic in a nice choice of luncheon specials and soups bearing with months and the seasons are highly  recommended"}
{"text":"I have gone to this place for 4 years, the last 3 times have been terrible, horrible and makes me feel if something is up...did they sell it. How can it be going down hill so fast?   Starting with  unfriendliness of some of the staff...3 for 3 this year...keep up the good work! The food is so overpriced for what you get. The food is mediocure at best. Last night I had a terrible $14.00 (I cant believe this) burger...which in part caused me to write this review...the wait time was terrible for both a seat and the food. incredible...Fountain hills...retirement community and still cannot understand why so many tall bar tables, (that were empty) versus normal tables....I wont go here anymore....done..."}
{"text":"Great place with a wonderful patio. The food is good bar food. The omg chicken is awesome. Also the Greek salad is good."}
{"text":"We took my Father In Law to the All American Sports Grill for his birthday. It was a Sunday night and there were 6 of us. We went in at 6:30pm with no reservations, and had no problem getting a table on the patio, overlooking the beautiful Fountain lake. Service was great. The manager greeted us as we walked in as if we were long lost pals, though we had never been the establishment before. Our waitress was sweet and prompt, and the busser was also very friendly. Also, when my dad asked for a specific game to be turned on, they were happy to oblige. There were TVs everywhere, even on the patio. We ordered the following, with the following comments:  Myself- Greek Salad, it was good. Just the right dressing to lettuce ratio, very fresh. I usually pick out odd pieces of lettuce that don't look crisp, and I didn't have to do that at all with this salad. I'm a big salad eater, so this is saying a lot.  Husband- Cheeseburger and Fries. He enjoyed it. He ordered it Medium Well and it was cooked to perfection. The fries were nicely cooked as well and perfectly salted, which I can report on because I stole about half of them.  Father- Very picky eater. He ordered a plain chicken sandwich, on a roll, with fries. Usually people will throw lettuce and tomato on the sandwich when he explicitly asks for them not to be. They didn't do that here. He was very happy about this. He said the chicken was well seasoned.  Mother- Bleu Cheese Burger and Sweet potato fries. She said the burger was delicious. They gave her a heaping portion of grilled onions, so many that she actually shared them with my FIL's girlfriend that was dining with us. They gave her a heaping helping of sweet potato fries as well. Very nice portions.   Father in Law/GF- Father in Law and his girlfriend split the Spinach Salad and the Smoked Wings. They raved about both of these dishes.They loved the Spinach Salad. Felt is was very fresh and the dressing was delicious. They both loved the Smoked Wings. The waitress told them that they were fall of the bone moist, and they sure were. They said they had never had wings like that. Father in law also commented that the Bleu Cheese Dressing was very potent, just how he liked it.  On the overall, we enjoyed it. I do prefer Four Peaks' food to All American Sports Grill's but the patio is so nice and the food was good that it makes it worth the trip!"}
{"text":"A very cool, laid back atmosphere which is what I look for in a sports bar! The French Dip sandwich is awesome."}
{"text":"Blonde manager acted disgusted when I asked her if we could bring our toy poodle on the patio. Alexis was our sever, not friendly- seemed annoyed. Ordered a double grapefruit mojito (alcohol came on the side) not a big deal, just odd. It was SO sweet I couldn't even drink it and I usually never turn down alcohol. My husband loves sweet drinks and he was like wow, too much. We sent it back, Alexus said they had complaints before but she seemed extra annoyed after I sent the drink back. Sorry, if I'm spending $15 on a drink it should be delicious. We ordered half hoisin/half teriyaki wings and the caprese salad. The wings were over cooked and I think what the chef did was mix the teriyaki and the hoisin sauce together and just put the sauce on all the wings (which ended up tasting like peanut butter) and peanut butter chicken is disgusting. Also, the wings were sitting in a bowl of sauce, it was just too much. The caprese salad was DRENCHED in balsamic, very sour almost inedible. The balsamic and olive oil is really just supposed to be a light drizzle. We were going to order more food but after the two overly sauced appetizers I decided against it. We rarely saw our waitress and even after we didn't touch our food she didn't ask if there was anything wrong with it. I decided not to complain since our bill was affordable and it was busy in the restaurant and I had already complained about the mojito. Two stars for beautiful view and warm ambience patio."}
{"text":"Amazing burgers and drinks. I love their main Thai drink. Great atmosphere and good music. I love sitting in the patio with an amazing view of the fountain."}
{"text":"Great place. Good atmosphere good cheese curds! Beautiful patio TV everywhere. First time here but worth the stop. Would suggest more craft beers on tap."}
{"text":"Poor service and a disappointing menu. Decided to just grab beers and go somewhere else for food."}
{"text":"The three stars are for the beautiful evening sitting on the patio across from the fountain.  The Portabella appetizer was good.  Hubby had a pizza but didn't read the other Yelp reviews first.  Looked like and tasted like at bake at home pizza.  He took a bite or two and left it.  They did take it off of the bill but really need to step up the pizza game.  I had a mushroom bacon burger.  Ordered no pink, it was still pretty pink.  It was pretty tasty though.  Hubby ate the rare spots for me.  Ordered a pomegranate margarita but they were out of the mix.  Waitress became scarce after hubby told her the pizza was no good.  Live music started at 8 pm, sounded pretty good on our way out the door."}
{"text":"Great experience and food!  Went in for late night food after work and had the caprese salad, crab cakes and kicked up mac and cheese.  All were delicious ...mac n cheeses was creamy and good with green chilies!  Sauce on crab cakes was rich and delicious.    Service was great!  My husband and I are in the business and have dined all over the world.  This was a fun and yummy experience!  Alicia too good care of us.. friendly fun and knowledgeable!  Made us feel like family!  We will be going back.   We've been back and it keeps getting better.  Love their Asian and Greek salads too!"}
{"text":"Came back during NFL games.  I grabbed a table and had better luck with he services.   Prices were reasonable.   Went back again yesterday to watch the Arizona game and they don't get the game?  Huh maybe the place should be renamed to the the All American Grill."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and plan to return again. Good service- good food! Good amount of options as well! View of the fountain which was beautiful. And it's always busy which is a good sign."}
{"text":"I love the field of green salad...  service not so much the bar lags on EVERY drink!!!  other than that its a good place to go if your in fountain hills..."}
{"text":"Nice view. Mediocre food. Sandwiches ordinary.  Had philly steak and tuna. Both on bread that was slightly old."}
{"text":"Monthly meeting with the girls brought us to this place which I thought was great! Randy was our server and although we were his only table outside, he took just fantastic care of us. 4 girls equals lots if special requests and he handled all of them in a timely manner and everyones order was correct. I had the blackened chicken sandwich (not on the menu)and onion rings and Randy made it happen. We had the spinach dip, soup, blt and both pasta dishes. All of it came out perfect. All in all, we were talking about next time we drive to Fountain hills, we're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I have this place 2 stars because of the view. Sitting on the patio, it overlooks the fountain hills fountain. Aside from the view the place is not worth going to... Our party of 4 quickly got sat down. Server brought us out drinks and quickly brought us our adult beverages... We were chatting quite a bit so the 3 times the waiter came to get our order we had to tell him to come back. He seemed very attentive and I appreciated that. After we finally got our order place he never came back to check on us. I had to keep going up to him at the waiters station and ask for another round for the table. Other waitress and bussboys delivered our food and came to clean up our table. As for our food it was blah!I got the Mediterranean chicken with mashed taters, and broccoli and my only thought was why would they drench this in salt... I couldn't taste anything else then salt. Even this morning, the next day as I'm writing this im, tasting salt. It pretty nasty. My wife got the buffalo chicken sandwich and she said it was gross had no flavor. She didn't even eat half of her sandwich. We were with friends so we didn't want to complain in front of them. We just learned next time we will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Good live music on the weekends, the food is good, and the staff is friendly.  My only negative here is that they frequently seem to be understaffed on busy weekend nights which leads to slower service and stressed out waitstaff."}
{"text":"Ate here during a holiday, and the place was just jammed with people (we had a tiny table that was way too cramped). As a result, the food, the service, and the ambiance all felt half-baked and rushed. Might try 'em again, but nothing special."}
