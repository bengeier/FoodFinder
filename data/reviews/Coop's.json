{"text":"The staff is friendly and the service is great.  The only issue I had was I wanted all flats wings and they still gave me 2 drums. They have done this before.  Almost to say they won't do all flats even though you ask and the waitress says no problem.  I would rate the value as low.  For 8 wings it's 11.99 no fries.  2 carrot sticks and 2 pieces of cucumber.   The taste of the wings are really good."}
{"text":"Great local pubs and the wings are amazing. Highly recommended if you're looking for fries, wings, and beer!"}
{"text":"The chicken wings that I ordered here were very well prepared, meaning that they had a good crispy crust and were well-cooked. I went with the recommendation of the server for the Creole Jerk sauce. I was not pleased with this sauce as their Creole part of it was simply some Creole mustard added to jerk seasoning. Another plus for the meal was my choice of going with the garden salad as my side item. It was huge. Enough for two people to enjoy."}
{"text":"Great local wing joint.  Staff here are always friendly and a very casually vibe.  I personally like Coops wings way more than Wild Wing, better taste and value.  They usually have great drink specials and a nice place to watch a game or meet up with friends for a snack and quick drink."}
