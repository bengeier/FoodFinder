{"text":"Best bakery I have been in a while! They make all their products from scratch on site and it shows.. as soon as you walk in the smell of deliciousness fills the air. I had a chocolate croissant and it was amazing! I also had a tuna salad sandwich on a pretzel that had just come out of the oven. 

To top it all the service is amazing and they make you feel very comfortable. 
Definitely a must-go bakery!!"}
{"text":"I was wondering how a small eatery in a strip mall could earn a perfect rating on Yelp. Now I know. Eating at Charlotte's was nothing short of a transcendent experience. The spot is run by 2 of the sweetest ladies. They know all the regulars by name and make a serious effort to accommodate different tastes. There was a gentleman ahead of me who couldn't make up his mind and they just kept feeding him different dishes till he was satisfied.

The oven roasted chicken sandwich I had was stupendous and easily ranks amongst the top 3 I've ever had. They not only piled on the veggies but also slathered it with 3 different sauces (the garlic sauce was the best). Not that the chicken needed any condiments. It was perfectly roasted and super juicy on its own.

I actually teared up a bit eating my sandwich. There are not that many places left in the world where the owners put so much heart into their food. I was missing it deeply even before the final bite.

When I told the owner I was visiting from the US she was genuinely surprised I was able to find her business. But with Yelp, I wouldn't be surprised if more foodies show up to this little local favorite."}
{"text":"Excellent plac for various lunch options and cookies.  Don't want to forget her Cheese Cake"}
{"text":"Amazing home made soup and chicken paella.
Fresh delicious he made pretzels. Made several timrs per day.
This place is a true jem!"}
{"text":"In Toronto for a week. Was in Brampton and looked up a lunch place on Yelp. Was so good went back the next day plus take out for dessert both days, too.  If I had the money I'd hire Charlotte for my personal chef. Chicken cutlets on Thursday best I've ever had. The desserts are great. 

6 stars."}
{"text":"Service was slow but the food was amazing! We ordered a chicken sandwich and Montreal smoked meat sandwich, served on a pretzel bun with three different kinds of homemade spreads, pesto, red pepper, and garlic butter. The atmosphere is very homey and welcoming. It's just a mom and her daughter working there and we got to learn about how they came to own this restaurant. Don't expect a meal in a hurry, or expect them to have everything on the menu, but if you go with an open mind and an empty stomach you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I'm writing a review, but I was inspired to write it as I had such a lovely experience today. I randomly stumbled upon this place after reading the yelp reviews and was coming from the airport. 

Janet (sorry if I spelled your name wrong) was so friendly and warm when I walked in on a Friday morning at around 10 am. She has a quiet demeanour with an easy smile and showed me the menu. It was interesting to see mostly German style offerings (e.g. schnitzel on Thursdays) and then a paella. I was intrigued. 

I ended up ordering 2 pretzel sandwiches. One with Montreal meat and the other with German salami. Next time I will try their homemade roast beef. She offered me samples to try their homemade mustard, spicy roasted red pepper sauce and garlic oil on a piece of the fresh soft pretzel. All delicious. The pretzel itself was crisp on the outside with soft interior. The size and shape is perfect to use as a sandwich. I asked her how many she makes on average in a day and she estimated 40-50. She also caters. Sometimes she runs out. She told me she has some customers call ahead and she makes sure she has fresh baked pretzels ready for them. 

I was the only customer that morning (before the lunch time rush) and she and her mother Charlotte (for whom the bakery is named after and also for Charlotte's web) were busy working away. Janet made sure I was well supplied with samples while I waited for my sandwiches. I got to try their pickled onion (it was so good in the sandwich) and some cookies (ginger snap and shortbread). The food was all excellent and it felt like I was eating someone's home cooking and baked goods. It was cozy and nice. She was so nice and lovely to chat with. She told me some of her life story: born in Germany, immigrated to Canada with her family, but her family also lived in Spain for a few years (hence the paella on the menu!).

The sandwich was yummy and was filled with the sauces (mustard, pepper, garlic), lettuce, spinach, alfalfa sprouts, tomato, pickled onion and cucumber. So fresh and delicious. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing homemade food. Great for a quick but tasty sandwich. Everyone is super friendly as well. 

Highly recommend the chicken sandwich with pesto sauce. Also had this baked desert thing with jam and cream cheese which was ridiculously good. Nice little spot in a business area. Also sampled a cinnamon croissant and a baked apple pie bar type thing and have only good things to say about them also."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've lived in Mississauga all these years and only now found this gem. This has to be one of the best home made sandwiches I've ever had. Everything is freshly prepared each day and you can taste the difference. Charlotte was very hospitable and gave us bits to taste before ordering. The brownie was soft and decadent. The Chicken sandwich was delightful. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Um, can I just say how happy we found this place!?!Owned by mother, Charlotte and daughter, Janet - they are so sweet and welcoming! It definitely has this homey feel to the place. Janet offered us all these samples as it came out fresh from the kitchen and oven. 

We got the vegetarian sandwich, tuna sandwich, brownie, butter tart and lattes. Everything was delicious! Remember to ask for the pickled onions in your sandwich! 

We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Read these reviews, start imagining what the service and food are like based on these glowing reviews, picture yourself having amazing food served by warm, welcoming ladies. Are you imagining that? Well, sorry, your imagination sucks because there's no way your mind could possibly match the reality. So stop imagining and go there. Go there now. It's the best thing you'll do for yourself all week, I promise you. 

It was my first time going there and the lovely young woman had me try out their homemade sauces on their homemade bread so I could decide which sauces I wanted on my roast chicken sandwich. And she and the lovely older woman were so funny and sweet as they joked with and took care of their regulars who came in. 

The food? Incredible. Fresh, delicious, homemade. Their roast chicken was so flavourful. The soft pretzel bun was glorious. Their mustard and garlic sauces were absolutely yummy. Their sticky bun? Delish. 

This is a small place. It's easy to pass if you're not looking for it. It's on the north side of Traders just west of Kennedy. Get here and enjoy lunch from a simpler, more delicious time. 

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous sandwiches, delicious treats, softest pretzels in the world and the nicest people you'll ever meet"}
{"text":"I have been here several times. Everything here tastes great and fresh.  I am so \"addict\" to their fresh soft pretzels. You need to try this place out won't be disappointed.Plus, Jeannette and Charlotte are really really nice!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing fresh food. Everything is prepared from scratch. Janet and Charlotte operate the restaurant as if you were a guest in their home. Make sure to visit and try the homemade sauces and pretzel."}
{"text":"Really good homemade style sandwich, I tried veggie one, taste so good. The owner definitely has passion for food and she is very proud her food. Service was great too. It is a little place and quite busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"Every so often I go to a place and by the first bite I know it will be a five star review. Then, my next thought is I should perhaps downgrade some of my previous 5 star reviews since they are simply not at this level.

I came on a Thursday when they were doing schnitzel. I already heard about their famous, fresh-baked pretzel buns, so I opted for it sandwich-style. I was offered a sample of the three sauces they make themselves. One was a mustard, but almost curry-style - and it really worked. There was a green sauce too which was a bit like pesto, but I don't think it had cheese in it. In any case, I went for all three sauces and they worked together beautifully. Lots of fresh veggie toppings such as spinach, arugula, sprouts and so on. 

The schnitzel was prepared fresh, so I was offered my side salad first. I should says saladS however since she had 3 prepared and offered to fill the bowl with any combination of the 3. So I had the garden salad mixed with a pasta and feta salad, along with a unique German potato salad (not mayo based) together. The garden salad, just like the veggies on the sandwich, were quality greens and perfectly fresh and no signs of wilting. 

The schnitzel sandwich arrived at least 10 minutes after my order. Again, it's made fresh so don't come in here in a hurry. I've already described most of it's contents, but eating it was just on a whole other level than virtually any other sandwich or bistro place I've been to. If I worked a bit closer, I'd almost be ruined financially since I'd probably eat out every lunch here. Or maybe not quite ruined since the value is phenomenal, with my sandwich and cereal bowl-sized salad coming up to about $13 all in.

This is certainly just a lunch place meant for a quick bite or takeout since there's only a few tables for two. As many have said, this is a mother-daughter tandem who are so incredibly friendly and hospitable, I wish that I could find a better way to describe it. They're both originally from Germany, but lived a considerable amount of time in Spain - hence some of the Spanish things on the menu, like Paella on Fridays.

There's desserts too, and the confirmed that everything is baked fresh daily, and they start around 5 each morning in order to prepare for the day.

This has to be the best soup/sandwich place outside of downtown, and even then nothing comes to mind that is any better at this price range."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and boy was I blown away by the hospitality and food. As soon as you step inside, you can tell that this is a family owned business as the ladies cooking know everyone who walks in by name. I came around 12 for lunch and it was very busy. There is only about 3 small tables to eat at so i think most of the customers take their lunch to go. These ladies work non stop and were extremely friendly. I finally settled on the thursday special which was chicken schnitzel with 3 types of salads: potato, pasta and leafy. I also got a pretzel bun with their three homemade sauces. It came to about $13.50 which was a great price for the portion size. Everything was fresh and flavourful. I was full for the rest of the day. 

 It may have taken 30 minutes to get my lunch but I came at their most busy time. They gave me a card and suggested I call to place my order ahead or drop by earlier to avoid the rush. I love when you can see the love that is put into the food.

Do yourself a favour and check this place out! You wont be disappointed. 

I plan to go back and try their cheesecake and paella special soon."}
{"text":"Best chicken sandwich i have had. Janet was wonderful, very hospitable and lovely human to talk too. This is by far my favourite food place in misssissauga"}
{"text":"I loved the cheesecake!!..it was delicious!!!...and our host Charolette was very hospitable."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible place for lunch! I saw good reviews and I work nearby so I finally came by here for lunch. I was mad that I hadn't come sooner!!!! Thai squash soup and yummy potatoes with salad and pasta. Best lunch I've had so far this year. Amazing service, friendly, attentive and reasonable priced. Will definitely be coming here again!!! Many times!!!"}
{"text":"A real gem.  Working in the area for 15 years I can say without hesitation that this is the best lunch spot in the area hands down.  Homemade, unbelievable quality (try the chicken) and best value around.  Owners are fantastic - you don't find too many spots like this."}
{"text":"I love this place...the food is great, everything is homemade and fresh...The ladies are awesome, they are nice and communicate with their customers... will definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"I've been here only once and I've vowed to come back it's just never happened since I'm all the way in Scarborough. From what I remembered, the ladies who run this little shop are absolutely sweet and amazing. I can taste love in every bite. It was close to closing time so everything sold out because everything is homemade the day of!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing people and great food! My family has used them in the past for catering and they are the most carrying people!"}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times now and not for the lack of trying. I come as often as I can get days off during the week!

Met Jeannette and Charlotte and they are both super friendly and sweet. First time I came by with my dad after grabbing some farmer market donations and I convinced my dad to try something new. 

Jeannette was kind enough to accommodate my dad with his requests for the pretzel as well as mine. I ended up with a cream cheese, alfalfa sprout and the trip of delicious sauces on top of a pretzel. I devoured it and then quickly ordered a half dozen plain ones for my co-workers!

Second time was with my partner for his birthday and I was looking forward to spaetzel! Charlotte made me a tofu vegetarian version to the meat version he got... cleaned both of our plates! While we waited we had a pretzel of course. 

Will come back for sure or call and order pick up in the near future. Love the history behind this family run business, and the people behind the delicious food!

Wished there were more of these restaurants still in sauga but then again, that's what makes Charlotte's extra special! 

FYI they cater!"}
{"text":"This is a small casual cafe with a few tables to eat. We shared a chicken sandwich  (leg meat) and chicken schnitzel. Both were fresh and tasty but the latter was better. Best part was the pretzel bun. The brownie was below my expectations - more cakey than fudgey. 

Service is very friendly - gave samples of sauces, walked us through the menu and the daily specials, etc.

I'll be back for the sandwiches!"}
{"text":"What a little gem!  Had the pleasure of finding this place while attending a trade show in Toronto.  
Customer service is amazing,  we were greeted by the sweetest woman,  I felt so welcome.  Right away she was giving us samples of her sauces and telling us about the food and specials.  Everything seemed delicious,  and I chose the roasted chicken sandwich on pretzel bread.  
We took a seat in the very small eating area,  and were offered another sample of a fresh salad,  that was also very good!  
While waiting for our sandwiches , we were told about \"mom\" and how she makes everything homemade. 
The sandwich was great,  bun was nice and soft,  chicken was moist and the veggies were fresh.  I could taste all their homemade sauces. Great lunch!  
While we were eating \"mom\" also came out of the kitchen to say hello,  she was very sweet and I was glad to meet her.  
Upon paying for our lunch,  we were offered a cookie and were thanked for coming by.  
This is such a nice family owned business,  there needs to be more of these places around! I would love to go back to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Amazing?I cannot find any other word to describe, just simply amazing! Charlotte and Janet are so friendly~ Everything's good!"}
{"text":"First time reviewer here so I'll just keep this short while I'm still learning how to write reviews.

Got the homemade roast beef sandwich on a pretzel. Never had a sandwich on a pretzel before but the pretzel was a good choice. Roast beef was very moist and made medium rare how I like it. I love that they make their own homemade sauces/toppings (pickled onions!!). Coming back to try their schnitzel sandwich next.

Recommend: Yes!"}
{"text":"I have been working in the area for years and just discovered this German bakery today.  The owners are awesome.  They gave me a thin slice of cheesecake to try while I was waiting for my lunch.  It was very authentically German - light and fluffy and very different from North American style cheesecake.  My lunch was a schnitzel on a bun with lettuce, tomato, spinach, alfalfa sprouts, cucumber and their own homemade mustard and pepper sauce on a pretzel bun.  The bun was not too dense and went well the schnitzel.  I meant to ask if they make pork schnitzel but forgot.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Everything in the restaurant is home made in the morning. Charlotte and her daughter are unbelievably pleasant and sweet. They do this every day because they love it. My mom and I had two pretzel sandwhiches which were delicious, followed by a slice of cheesecake while they made me some fresh butter tarts. She even threw one free one in for us.
They are very generous and offer everyone waiting short bread cookies which were melt in your mouth good.  I inquiries about the paella and they didn't hesitate to give me a sample. 
I only wish this place was opened on weekends.
These ladies have hearts of gold!"}
{"text":"This has to be a hidden gem of Mississauga. I had one of the best sandwiches of my life here. They use a soft pretzel bun and homemade sauce it was just perfect. The lady was extremely nice! She was even went out of the way to give me the sample of the paella as I was confused what to get. Will defiantly come back!"}
{"text":"What can I say. The food here is absolutely amazing. It's very fresh and a family restaurant. The schnitzel on Thursdays is amazing and the pretzel bun is absolutely fantastic. Definitely recommend this place as a sit down relax and enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"If we could rate this place a 6 start, I would. A+++ for service too. Jeanette was amazing. Very attentive and generous. The place is simple amazing. Make sure that you have ample time when you visit. Service and food both worth the wait. Call ahead to find out the day's specials. Soft freshly baked pretzels are good enough to eat on it's own without condiments. Would go back again 100%"}
{"text":"By George have I been transported to a small European cafe?  Sadly no, I'm still in an industrial part of Mississauga, BUT I'm happy to report that Charlotte's Homemade Goodies is like being transported elsewhere!  

Based on its location, I believe Charlotte's is a spot meant for the lunch/snack/early dinner crowd.  Place is small and slightly cramped.  There are a few tables and a counter and not much room in between!  When I visited, around 2pm, there were a few people, singles, sitting at separate tables, checking their phones whatnot.  Seemed pretty chill and not what I expected - I think I missed the lunch crowd!

Lady who was working behind the counter was extremely friendly and offered me a sample of Seafood Chowder and even Cheesecake when I said I was going to get them.  She even offered me a piece of the pretzel bun she makes with different sauces.  

I had already eaten lunch, but had this place bookmarked and a snack.  In the end, I got a Seafood Chowder ($5, large, came with a small pretzel bun - yum!) and a piece of cheesecake ($3).  Seafood Chowder was nice, decent portion, could've been a bit thicker - my own personal preference, cheesecake was really nice, fluffy, sponge-like, not too sweet at all.  Pretzel bun was really nice and this is coming from someone who hates pretzels, but perhaps I've been eating the wrong ones.  This one had a crunchy crust and really soft on the inside.  Apparently they make sandwiches with their made in-house pretzel buns.

What really stood out was the lady's demeanor.  She was soo sweet and when she was serving, whom I assumed to be a regular, she asked if he wanted more this or that on the plate.  These people seemed to be eating at their home/their mom's.

By the menu, it seems as though the items are German-inspired, re:  pretzels, spaetzel, schnitzel, etc.

Location is the only iffy thing.  I'm rarely in this area, but I'd definitely stop by again if I am next time AND keep them in mind to cater an open house or whatnot.  Hidden gem fo sho!"}
{"text":"On my way to the airport for my morning flight, I quickly looked up places to grab some coffee and food and chose this little restaurant on a whim. Upon entering, I was immediately blown away by the owner's generosity. In addition to my order, she had me try a bunch of her homemade sauces and goodies, which were all delicious. And when she found out I was flying back home, she gave me some cookies for the flight. Who does that? I mean wow, the owner is just so incredibly sweet and gracious. I would return just to experience her genuine kindness."}
{"text":"We got to meet Charlotte, which was special because she said she's usually in the back cooking. She was in no rush and happy to explain the yummy sauces and options for sandwiches and salads. At 2pm we were lucky to get the last pretzels for our sandwiches. I like the spicy sauce on the chicken or Montreal smoked meat. 

This is such a special lunch spot. It feels like you've wandered into your grandma's kitchen. Full of love in this food."}
{"text":"Charlotte is the kindest human you will ever meet, and she and her staff are beyond amazing. My husband and I were visiting the area for a short while and stopped here for lunch before heading back to the airport. Our experience was unforgettable. The place is simple, but the food was delicious and the service we received was superb. Charlotte allowed us to try samples of the food before ordering, and she made good conversation that made you feel like she really cared about you. The combination of her sweet demeanor and phenomenal home style cooking/baking left us longing for this experience more often but that you won't find anywhere else these days. And for the short while we were there, away from our home, it felt like home. The soft pretzels are made fresh and are so good! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and wow that was a good roast chicken sandwich and the service was very good as qell."}
{"text":"Very cute, homey cafe with delicious sandwiches. Me and my fiancé tried this place out today based off of all the stunning reviews on yelp. You can tell they put a lot of love into all of their food. Charlotte is so cute too! Such a sweet little lady :) One thing to mind though: don't come here if you're in a rush (especially around lunch hour). It gets packed and they take their time with each order. But the tasty payoff is totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I am going to be as forward as possible. BEST HOME MADE SANDWICH I HAD FOR A LONG TIME.
If you want a sandwich soup or cake you have to come to this place. If you like fresh homemade food, this is the place to eat at.
Their bread is made perfectly. Sandwiches and their sauces are to die for. And their chowder... lord have mercy on my belly because I will eat it everyday.
I CAN'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE MORE THAN I CAN RIGHT NOW. 10/10"}
{"text":"I haven't had such a wholesome food experience in a long time. Amazing people. Everything was amazing and fresh. Must go for lunch"}
{"text":"What you read about the reviews here is true. This place is very, very nice.

Not the fandy decor or anything - this humble, unassuming café is located in an industrial plaza. Rather, it's the food and the owners that really make this place shine.

Janet is absolutely kind and generous, she will make sure that you are well fed with even just the samples as you walk in. And ask for samples you should, because everything here is delicious. The soft baked pretzels are wonderful with a variety of homemade spreads. The homemade roast beef is soft and flavourful. The paella which I got to sample was delicious as well. How Janet and Charlotte create such amazing foods in so small a kitchen is a wonder.

I only came here because I forgot to bring lunch. I am glad I did! I don't think I'll be packing lunch for a while. I am going to have to try everything on the menu before I can even begin to entertain other options for lunch.

Hidden gem of hidden gems for sure."}
{"text":"I was in the area visiting a client for the week and found this place. Wow!! Everything is homemade

For lunch, I had a Montreal Meat sandwich on a soft pretzel bun with the daily soup Seafood Chowder. The sandwich was perfect, including homemade mustard, chilli sauce and garlic paste. The chowder had tons of seafood bits, cooked perfectly. Their daily specials look amazing.

This is the type place you don't want to tell people about if it's your usual. I'm disappointed I didn't come here Mon-Thu"}
{"text":"Cute place in Mississauga! We were warmly greeted when we walked in by Janet and her mother Charlotte, who run the place.  I liked that a lot of their foods are homemade, including their soft pretzels, pickled onions, sauces, and roast beef among others. Janet let us taste their 3 sauces and pickled onions and all were very tasty.  I ordered the roast beef soft pretzel sandwich and it was very good. I'd recommend getting it with everything - don't forget the pickled onions! I especially enjoyed the warm soft pretzel as the bread, which was straight out of the oven. I also tried their brownie and cheesecake, both of which were light and fluffy. I'll be back for more pretzel sandwiches!

Taste:  5/5
Service: 5/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Value for Money: 4/5
Would I come again: Yes"}
{"text":"This teeny tiny spot has food that packs flavor that'll knock your socks off! Enjoy a sammie on their freshly made pretzel rolls. You won't regret it! Their house made sauces are to die for! The food honestly tastes like a labor of love. Everything is made to order so it won't be quick, but I can promise it will be delicious!"}
