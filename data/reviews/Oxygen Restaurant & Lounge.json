{"text":"Had a dinner party here with family, the environment was incredible. The owner was constantly checking up to make sure everything was perfect, I personally ordered the steak and it was amazing. Additionally, the price on the menu is exactly what you pay (everything is already factored in to the price) which isn't much at all! The portions were amazing and not just for my order. I thoroughly enjoyed coming here and will most definitely come soon."}
{"text":"Warning: the service here is extremely slow and unorganized. I made a reservation for eight and for some reason my table was not ready when we got there. Even tho the reservation was made the night before. Then when it's time to ordered food the staff then would just tell us either the dishes are n/a or it takes too long to make. They should of told us that from the beginning what is available so we won't waste time deciding on dishes that they weren't able to make. So some of my friends decided on just the basic unbattered chicken wings and almost 2 hours it still have not arrived so they had to cancelled their ordered and get food somewhere else. The only reason why I still gave it two stars is because 1 star is for the decor, the place was decent it looks clean and I do like how they have individual tv in each booth and the other star was for my food that was actually decent. But due to poor service will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've had such a universally awful experience at a restaurant. I'll preface by saying the restaurant was nearly empty at the time. Let's see: I ordered a vodka martini, and what came was some pink drink with two fruit flies floating in it. I ordered a chicken breast with fries, and after inquiring as to it's status 25 minutes later, I was told it'd be another 10 minutes. When it came, the chicken was oily on the outside and bone dry on the inside, and they mixed up the only other component, my fries. Instead, they brought me a bowl of what clearly came from a salad-in-a-bag.   The owner came over to apologize -- just kidding, he came to blame everything on the new waitress. I asked how she could be blamed for what were clearly bar and kitchen issues. No response. I asked whether he intended to charge me for my meal despite all these problems. First answer: yes. Second answer: well, you've twisted my arm, maybe I can give you a coupon for a free appetizer next time. Third answer: well, just sit here and eat the meal -- if you end up liking it, you should pay for it. At that point, I lost my appetite and left.  TL;DR: Everything in bar and kitchen went wrong, owner blamed 'new waitress' for everything and his attitude made things ten times worse. And the food was greasy, dry and bland."}
{"text":"I didn't know much about this place but the owner treated us like VIP the minute we walked in, he gave our table (of 4) free appetizers and made several recommendations that blew us away! Egg spring rolls, Thai Chicken, sweet pepper Milanese, beef szechuan, stuffed grape leaves with lemon gravy, Shiraz kabab, kashmiri rice and we ended it with fresh smoothies that were to die for, brownie dessert and coffee!  The food portions are bigger than average, food was delicious and the price was about $120 for the entire table!!!!!!! They're for real... NO TAX and definitely NO TIP on the bill... I thought they would build it into the price but a those prices I don't know how.  We're definitely coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"Expensive  No parking  Empty   Don't people check the history of business before opening up and closing restaurants in the same spot? This is the 3rd or 4th in just a few years. I feel sad for the owner but then I think of prices being higher than popular places and suddenly don't care.   Pretty sure subway next door makes more revenue.   Can't recommend."}
{"text":"We decided to try something new, as we pass this place often. It was dead but I saw a stage area had been set, I asked if they were going to have a band play later, and the waitress told us a belly dancer would be performing around 10:30pm.  We had got to the restaurant around 5pm, so it was quite a while from then - why do so many things start so LATE on a Friday night?  Still, we liked the selection from the menu, and decided to stay.  Our waitress sat us in a quiet booth with a good view of the stage area.  We take a while to decide what we want typically, so I asked for a couple of glasses of water while we went over the menu.  About five minutes later she comes back - without any water - and asks us if we're ready to order.  We were still looking over the menu, so I politely said we still needed more time. She smiled and left us -- still no water!  Another five or so minutes later she comes by and this time we are ready to order.  We decided to try an appetizer - the one with feta cheese and tomatoes.  I ordered a Mojito ($11.95) to start, and the Chicken Cashew ($17.95). My girlfriend ordered a Sex with the Sailer ($12.95) and a Chicken Kiev ($18.95).  I specifically asked her to bring the appetizer first, wait for us to finish it and then bring our main courses.  She smiled, and said that because the food is made fresh, it takes a while to prepare. I told her that was fine - it's a Friday night -- we have the whole nite.  She went to place our order -- still no water.  About 15 minutes later, our waitress arrives with our alcoholic drinks. I ask her for some glasses of water - she apologizes and does bring us two glasses of water.  We're enjoying the atmosphere, and the classic rock playing in the background.  About 30 minutes later, our MAIN COURSES ARRIVE.  I reminded the waitress we ordered an appetizer, and she replies: \"I don't know what happened to that.\"  We look at each other awkwardly.  She says she can check with the kitchen. We end up cancelling the appetizer.  My Chicken Cashew was a delicious blend of white breast meat, celery, onions, and cashews, stew fried and served along side steamed white rice.  Very tasty, with a slight kick from the peppery sauce.  My girlfriend's Chicken Kiev was two chicken breasts, breaded and oozing a garlic butter sauce, with a generous helping of mashed potatoes and a side salad. I tried her dinner and it was delicious too.  Our waitress came by a few times throughout the meal to check on us and everything was great.  We did have to keep asking her to refill our waters though - in a place charging as much as they do -- I expect the second you see an empty glass it to be filled.  For desert, we ordered a Baklava (($6.95) and my girlfriend got a Irish Coffee ($14.00) and I got a single-shot Amaretto on the Rocks ($7.95).  The  Baklava came as three small pieces, each slightly different and just warm.   My drink was just a standard bar shot, but my girlfriends was a more fancy beverage. And at $14.00 we expected it to be more fancy - but it was just like anything you'd get anywhere else -- no chocolate sauce, sprinkles, not even a cherry on top.  We take our time, so the SLOW service wasn't bad. Remember, we arrived around 5pm and as we wrapped up dinner it was about 9:30pm.  So, we stuck around for the belly dancer at 10:30pm.  A little past 10:30, she came out.  She was beautiful, in a blue outfit with sequins and jewels, and sparkling things all around her. She was a friendly and joyful person to watch - dancing right up to our table asking if we wanted to dance.  I smiled and told her she does it much better than I could.  It was shortly after she started dancing that the place got busy.  Old Arab men, and they brought out their hookah pipes.  And began smoking them right in the restaurant!  Actually, the restaurant had it's own pipes, and supplied the stuff they were smoking.  The old arab men - average age over 50 - seemed less interested in the belly dancer and her beauty, and more interested in sitting alone, puffing on their hookah.  Neither of us smoke ANYTHING - and there was no mention of this anywhere in the restaurant.  The hookah smoking actually freaked out my girlfriend, and she just wanted to get the bill and leave.  So we asked for our bill.  WOW!  For the two of us it came to $102.49 ($90.70 + $11.79 tax) - and I tipped 16% in addition to over priced bill, so the grand total was $117.  I feel ripped off because of excessively over priced food and drink items. I don't mind paying a high price for high quality. But I've spent far less and had much better elsewhere.  Also if you don't TELL your customers that hookah is sold and smoked on site -- they won't know until suddenly - as with my girlfriend - it freaks them out."}
{"text":"I know, there's nothing else in the area, but avoid this place if you can.   Good if:  -you want to watch t.v. at an always empty bar  -beer (which is not hard to mess up) -decor is not bad, but mostly leftover from the other restaurant that was here before (Jackson City was it called?)   Why you should avoid this place: -that was the worst whiskey sour I've ever had (upon inquiry, it was the mix they had)   -Food quality is as good as a box of chicken nuggets from price chopper that have been sitting in your freezer for a few years. Even if you were on a budget, Mc.Donalds across the street will give you the same thing with tasting uh, fresher (*cringe*) with a better generic cheap tasting store bought sauce for half the price (sorry to say)   -The way the owner talks to the staff and his regular customers was disgusting and absolutely disrespectful- in front of other customers! People you would (or should, anyways) want to visit again, I'd assume?   -the 'tax and tip included' bit- the servers always make more money if they were given tips based on their service, separate from his prices and also this would provide incentive for good service, which is kind of half/half here.    Because the area is lacking in bars to pick from, it would have been nice if this place was any decent *shrug*   Anyhow, choose wisely."}
{"text":"First came in and heard horrible loud retro dance music. After about an hour it finally changed to much better music.  The prices for their items are ridiculous  $12 for a cocktail??!!  I think the beer was $8.  Their wedges were not breaded.  Their hamburger was good, however, the french fries were not freshly cut (definitely from frozen).  I remember that their butter chicken was $17 (however I think this was similar pricing to its previous Jackson City Grill).  The waitress was very nice and friendly, she would probably be the only reason I would ever come back.  I also found it odd they advertised no tip or tax. But luckily, the machine still asked for tip, which I believed the waitress deserved. We were only taxed very minimally, pocket change really.  Everything on the menu was over priced, and does not balance out with not being charged for tax."}
{"text":"Interior is nice and it's cool that the booths get their own television. And apparently their own beer is good at great prices. However, since I wasn't feeling like beer the night I went, I ordered their sangria. It was $13 for one glass and it came to me lukewarm with no fruit in it. Not impressed.  I was only there to have a drink and was not hungry but the waitress we had kind of kept pressuring me to order something. I mean... there's upselling and promoting but then there's just plain pressuring. I didn't feel super comfortable when she kept coming back and trying to sell me something off the menu."}
