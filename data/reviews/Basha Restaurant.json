{"text":"I have ordered from these guys multiple times. Everytime it is awesome. The staff is super friendly and always deliver everything exacly as ordered and very fast. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Best Lebanese on Wellington!! The staff is very friendly and if you're in need of late night eats it is definitely the place to come. Open till midnight Sunday-Wednesday and Thursday-Saturday till 1am."}
{"text":"I had chicken shawra twice at Basha Montreal Trust. I must say the second time I had it was really good for the price they are charging. A piece of advice, better go there around noon time when it is fresh and not too dry."}
{"text":"Since Basha is supposed to be a fast-food type restaurant, it was nice to see that there was a good sit-down section, like in a traditional restaurant. However, the speed of the service turned the fast-food into slow food. The waitress was nice enough, but there was only one of her, and many hungry patrons. The food is standard fare Montreal Lebanese fast food. We ordered some wine with our lunch (what can I say, I'm European!). Since we didn't want to be drunk getting back to work, we ordered the only wine which was available as a 1/2 bottle. It was terrible! All in all, there are much better restos in the area which are much better and cheaper, though often without the liquor license (try Chinatown, right close by). If you must have Lebanese food in the area, this is one of the only places to go."}
{"text":"Food is nothing special, hummus doesn't taste like hummus, the waitress didn't even serve the food on a tray, and the tables were very dirty. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"J'aime cette endroit malgré qu'il est dur de se faire servir en français. La bouffe y est très bonne mais les portions sont très variables. Parfois tu mange à ta faim, parfois t'as pratiquement juste de la salade dans ton plat. Les cuisiniers y sont sympathiques et rapide mais les femmes voilées c'est pas mal le contraire. J'y retournerai probablement mais moins souvent."}
{"text":"My husband and I just ordered a shish taouk platter. When it arrived and we opened the bag, all there was inside was rice and potatoes, nothing else, not even salad. When my husband called to complain, the guy was extremely rude to him.   We are never ordering from this place again. They often get our orders mixed up and it's just not worth it anymore."}
{"text":"I had to write a review for this place.  They make good shish taouk, shawarma and amazing salads.  This place uses quality ingredients, I mean what other fast food restaurant makes mango or avocado salads? The choice is definitely decent as well, you always have at least 6 different salads to choose from.  As far as freshness goes, I've never even seen a wilted leaf of lettuce there.  They are consistently generous, always filling everything to the top, fresh quality ingredients and great service.  Today, I ordered a small salad portion for take out, when they brought my salad packed in those styrofoam flip top boxes into the back, I was wondering what it was they were doing, turns out they were wrapping the whole thing in plastic wrap so that none of the dressing would leak.  I don't even get that kind of service when I order soup from other places!  Maybe not all that environmentally friendly but again great service.  I just had to write a review."}
{"text":"Been here once, I never got sick after eating anything but here... Took a Shawarma sandwich on a monday afternoon, it tasted honestly great, really spicy, like I love my Shawarma, been to sleep 2h later.  Woke up the next morning with a pain in my stomach, throw up my previous day meal while having a ''number-two'' at the same, it was a really unpleasant experience.  This was the only unusual stuff I ate this day, so yeah, maybe it was exceptional, but I wont take the chance eating here again."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a few times in the last couple weeks. I have been impressed with how fast the delivery driver arrived. I only tried a few items, but I very much enjoyed the shish taouek platter, baba ganoush and garlic potatoes. There are some decent specials for delivery that offer a nice change from pizza."}
{"text":"This Lebanese restaurant we gave a chance because it was convenient and we were pressed for time.  This is a half cafeteria half service restaurant underneath the Palais de Congress Montreal.   Whenever you get a gut feeling about a place or something, remember to follow it, with me after a few minutes the waiter that sat us had already rubbed me the wrong way.   This is a half cafeteria half service restaurant underneath the Palais de Congress Montreal.   When we first walked in my parents saw something from the \"cafeteria\" side that they wanted to order.   When we sat down I guess on the service side, he said he could not bring the food from the cafeteria side ( even thought it was the same food), and that we had to order form that side, I looked at him and he looked like he was almost going to kick us out off that area, so I told him I was gong to order something from the service side, so that made him less grumpy.   So I quickly ordered what was the simplest and basically safest thing off the menu I believe was hard to screw up.  Hummus, fallafel and salad combo, while my parents ordered from the cafeteria side and had to bring it to our side.   15 minutes later my Mom arrived with their food, I watched them eat half their food before I thought I saw my order up on the pick up area of the service side, but I figured with the long wait for something simple they were making it fresh, but no..... I caught them pulling it from the cafeteria side.  So if they pulled food from the cafeteria side, why couldn't they have served my parents food over too?   So in 25 minutes I got my order,  very disappointing, I knew it was going to suck, the falafel was colder than my hummus and salad.   Feels like it has been there for days and dry.   I dunno maybe they do falafel differently, but I have always had fresh falafel out of the fryer or pan, this was like dried out  and 2 days old form the refrigerator, they could have at least tried to fake it and microwave it.   I ate  some of it because we were pressed for time, the hummus was ok so that and the salad I basically finished.   I left 3 out of my 5 falafels untouched to send a message to the waiter and chef.  When we left and paid we complained about the food, they were surprised we dared to tell them that in almost disbelief like what do you mean you didn't like it.   Oh well just saying folks..., and letting everyone here know how you guys run.    Oh and what rubbed me with wrong way with the waiter?  When we first walked in we were seating ourselves because nobody greeted us to do so and no sign to wait to be seated.   The guy came rushing out yelling in an irritated manner  at us not to sit where we were about to sit, loud enough to cause attention for all in the restaurant to look, normally I wouldn't give a hoot, but I was with my parents and one of them handicapped and they are very private people who wish no attention brought to them esp with a walker and such.   So I barked back well you better seat us in a spacious place because we need handicapped seating.   This caught him off guard, and his tone changed a little.   Anyways that was the beginning, I understand it's a cultural difference, French Canadian Lebanese trifecta going on here, but hey you should be nicer to customers in any restaurant in any country!"}
