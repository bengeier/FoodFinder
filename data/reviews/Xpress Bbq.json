{"text":"I really hope what I am about to say resonates with you. Being of Portuguese descent and a serious Portuguese chicken connoisseur I have had Portuguese chicken from many different places across southern Ontario. The Portuguese chicken from this establishment is so delicious. It is one of the top 5 Portuguese chicken places that I have had in this province. I am not kidding. I strongly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"This place is busy because it's really good Portuguese chicken! Rice is ok but I'm not a rice guy, potatoes and chicken are fantastic.  When a place does high volume like this one the food is always fresh and portions are a good size.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Food 2/5 (50% of final grade) Disclaimer: The only other \"Portuguese Chicken\" I've eaten was in Macau, so my review might be VERY biased, and largely based on my experience with BBQ chicken in general. Simply put, the chicken was bland. I was surprised that with so much sauce smeared over it came out to be so... bland. After the initial hit of the salt I simply couldn't taste anything else. No spice, no oils, semi-dry texture of chicken. Not to my tastes.  Ambiance 2/5 (15% of final grade) The interior was small, so this was obviously a takeout place. The moment you step into the establishment, you come face to face with the cashier. This felt very cramped and much too in-your-face for me, but that's only attributable to the placement of the register, so there. Other than this, there were three tables outside for seating, the place itself looked clean.  Service 2.5/5 (15% of final grade) Nothing particularly bad or good about the service, it was just normal people serving normal food normally.  Cost 3/5 (10% of final grade) For the amount of work that seemed to have been put into the chicken, and the fact that they seemed much authentic, the cost was perfectly reasonable, if not on the cheaper side. I would recommend this place for a late night chicken to go with some light drinks at the peak of a summer night.   Other 3/5 (10% of final grade) Brownie points for the cool cooking method they used. They had a huge oven/roaster where they put a flattened raw chicken in to roast (slid into the oven on its side on a pan) before taking it out and smearing it with what was supposed to be juicy Portuguese sauce.   Final Grade = 45.5/100 = 2 Stars  TLDR: Not a particularly notable place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I bought over $400 of chicken, rice, potatoes & salad there this past Sunday. I got 1/2 the chickens mild and asked for 1/2 plain with the sauce on the side. They charged me $8 for the sauce which would have been free if it was put on the chicken. I didnt complain but asked them about it and the guy just said. \"Ya, they charge for it\" this was my 3rd catering order but the first that I picked up myself. Happy I did, will not return.  Sauce was orange rather than the usual red sauce from most portugese places & Food was about average at best"}
{"text":"Decent Portuguese food here... Chicken is good but not great.  The rice could use a little help, but Im not a rice guy anyways.  Potatoes are always undercooked and generally flavourless compared to typical Portuguese restaurant fare.  Many folks frown that you have to pay for hot sauce, but keep in mind, the hot sauce is actually made in house and comes in a variety of sizes.  I personally think it's well worth the cost, especially when you know you're not getting something run of the mill in a packet.  Be careful though as the sauce does spoil quickly.  I've noticed that it turns after about a day when stored properly in the refrigerator. So it's better to get a size that will be consumed quickly.  Just my experience."}
{"text":"I would love to be the first to review this place.  We all know that Portuguese BBQ chicken places are a dime a dozen but in my eyes this one stands out for me.  This place is very busy and its probably a good idea to call your order in before you go to avoid the wait times.  There is very little space to sit down and eat so I would plan on doing take out.   Now on to the food.    The chicken is very fresh and tasty.  Perfect on the seasoning.  Its never dry.  Very moist.  The potatoes and rice are pretty standard.  The shrimp patties are to die for.  Mmmmmm deep fried goodness LOL.    Prices are very reasonable.  Great food for great prices.  This is my place of choice when in the area for Portuguese chicken."}
{"text":"I might be judging this place a little harsh as I grew up on this food, but I did find the chicken to be a little greasy and they charge extra for the piri piri sauce. If you are going for lunch I would recommend going a bit earlier as they do get busy between 12:15-1pm.   Also the portions are decent so if you're not a big eater stay with the quarter chicken."}
{"text":"Really good chicken!  As I entered this Portuguese chicken eatery I definitely noticed the delicious golden smokey scent coming from the ovens. When I saw an oven open with the chickens spread on vertical racks, I knew I came to the right place. I ordered the half chicken dinner which came with 2 sides so I chose the potatoes and veggies. I also tried a Portuguese shrimp puff which was sweet and creamy, really good!!  It took a while to get my order because it's a small place and there were a good amount of people there, on the bright side it does build up a hunger. Unfortunately the food smell gets into your clothes as you wait and there is no place to eat food there.  When I received my meal I went outside and sat on a curb to enjoy the goodness. The chicken was tender and flavourful with smoke and topped with peri peri sauce.  The potatoes were a bit salty and the veggies were steamed well. I would definitely recommend this place for a pickup. Remember to order ahead."}
