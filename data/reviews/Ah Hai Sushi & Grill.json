{"text":"Have to admit, didn't have high expectations of this place going in. Good sushi is hard to come by in the west valley But it blew me away. Not only are the prices low, but the sushi is actually really good. Great happy hour menu everyday from 3-9:30ish. Lots of discount rolls too. And it's CLOSE, for us Goodyear/Buckeye folk.   Stop in soon. They're expanding their dessert menu w mochi. Stay away from the water though... they need a filter! :-) I am looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I have never written a post, but offten depend on them to make my food choices. I must say the happy hour is fantastic the food is great and prices are fair. The Dynamite Roll, and Thunder Rolls are great. And the service is great. I would recommend this place to anyone and or you the viewer of this review. Thanks"}
{"text":"Awesome! Love the happy hour menu, we got 4 rolls and the volcano roll was favorite.  Everything tasted fresh and was pretty quick. The staff was very friendly and nice. We found our new sushi place. Well be back."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant in the West valley. Their fish is always of the best quality and super fresh. They have an extended happy hour menu, which makes the experience so affordable. They also have a varied lunch menu which includes sushi and also cooked meals. Once you try it, you definitely will keep coming back."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in the area. Fast and friendly. Happy hour is so cheap too."}
{"text":"Great food, and a till close food and drink happy hour. The service was very good too."}
{"text":"I've been going here with my wife now for two years. Great food and great prices, but the kicker is their amazing service. We almost always get helped by Yuki. She is so kind and hard working. She also remembers us every time. We are regulars because of her."}
{"text":"I go here about once a week and get excited to eat every time!  Happy hour is pretty much all day every day and the prices during those times are highly worth it due to the quality of their food!  The nigiri is always fresh and just melts in your mouth. Never chewy or bland taste.  The rolls are good too!  I always get a Dynamite roll with every order.  I brought my family there a couple months ago and they love it so take it from all of us and all the majorly positive reviews here and go get some sushi!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. Been here a few times, everything always tastes fresh.  Today had Spicy girl and Rainbow roll, shrimp teriyaki, comno fried rice ."}
{"text":"Have been to alot of sushi bars around the valley and this one was the best for the price of the meal. My husband and I ordered several thing and the bill was only 60 dollars.  Every thing was very good. The mackerel was by far my favorite. The pink lady roll just melts in your mouth.  I personally thought the eel was over sauced. But Husband loved it. Service was friendly and prompt.  Could not sample dessert because freezer was broken. Next time will try dessert"}
{"text":"Good rolls for a good price, especially during happy hour. Good service too. Beer could be  a bit colder though. We will continue coming here when we want sushi"}
{"text":"We LOVE Ah-Hai. Their happy hour pricing can't be beat, and there are so many options. Our personal favorites are the Thunder Roll, Scorpion Roll & the Philly Roll. (The Thunder Roll is my absolute favorite...and I don't like sushi typically). All 3 are on the happy hour menu at reduced pricing. Oh Happy Day!"}
{"text":"We looveee to eat here. Good sushi (for Phoenix) and great prices! Love their happy hour specials. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the service... Definitely need new servers but hey you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"I love sushi and it's really hard to find a good place to eat at. The bento boxes here are exceptional. Great servings you will be full and might not be able to finish the box. (good thing you take some home;) I love that they have different types of beer my favorite TSINGTAO goes down smooth. Also the pricing is very fair. I'm deff a repeat customer for the west valley."}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean. Love the pink lady and salmon skin hand wraps."}
{"text":"The staff here is very friendly... the atmosphere is nice and the food is delicious... specifically the scorpion roll!   A little pricey... but definitely one of the best sushi places in the west valley!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this little gem, located on the farrr westside!! Ah Hai is clean, cozy, and super cute. The service was great---very helpful and attentive. And, well, their happy hour is unbeatable! My date and I ordered 4 rolls and our bill came to $13 and some change. The sushi was yummy and filling. This place also gives a complementary orange--which is a great touch, and it just so happened to be the best orange ever! Even their chopstick were high quality! :) I hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sushi place, the food is great and you can't beat their happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Welcome to the restaurant that you absolutely don't know what your talking about with any living employee that works there, but why not risk it if the food is amazing.  Also, remember to order everything you think you'll eat or else you'll feel as if they just took your mug shot to never be let inside the restaurant ever again. Did I mention the food was great!!"}
{"text":"My husband works out of town & when he comes home we always go on a sushi date. & this is the place we will always go to! Best sushi & service ever. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi eater, in fact I always order an avocado roll just to feel cool and one with the people. With that said, I really enjoy their habachi chicken, more than their teriyaki, and the veggies with that plate are delish. I love me their fried rice as well. I always hope I'll have some left over for extra. The service is great and the atmosphere is cozy. Definitely a local fave of mine because I can always count on quick service."}
{"text":"I could not be happier that such a wonderful restaurant finally went in near my home. In the cooler months, it is so refreshing to walk there, eat some amazing sushi or dinner items, and then walk home satisfied. Their lunch menu contains all of the perfect dishes, and the bento box lunches are not only yummy, they're fun! The happy hour menu, available seven days a week, is priced so low that it feels like you're robbing them. They have signature rolls I have never had the pleasure of experiencing elsewhere, and my two favorites are the spicy girl and thunder roll. When I'm not in the mood for sushi (which happens very rarely), I tend to get their Yaki Udon or Yaki Soba, depending on if I want thick or thin noodles. There just isn't a dish I or my dinner mates have tried that isn't scrumptious.   The atmosphere and staff are wonderful as well. They know who we are after so many visits and always stop to say hi and inquire how we are doing. They even know what we like to eat. The decor is perfect; eastern flair but not overdone like in some restaurants. Despite what others have said, I love the music that plays. It's most of my favorite songs, so it makes me cheery while I eat amazing food. Can I give them 6 stars?"}
{"text":"I don't eat sushi so I couldn't tell you if that's any good or not but I had chicken tempura and it was delicious. If you're eating there you MUST order the plum wine, though. It's amazing."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good sushi, eat here! They have a great assortment rolls.   I have been here several times and each time has been a good experience.   They have a great Happy Hour with a pretty decent menu to choose from. They have new rolls often"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in AZ. Who knew the best sushi could be found in the desert! There is something for the sushi purest as well as a large supply of \"Fusion\" rolls for the people that don't like the raw fish. I eat here at least once a week! Happy hour and lunch specials make sushi affordable again."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite sushi restaurant here in Goodyear excellence service really nice staff clean environment I can't say enough!"}
{"text":"Well, here we are once again. It's Thursday night and I'm sitting next to my hub and kiddos. I think my favorite reason for dining at this establishment is that not only do they have yummy sushi but that the waitress always seems to remember us. We've been coming here since they first opened and we've probably tried everything on the menu ten times over. It's not a fancy place but it seems to be clean and we've always had superb service."}
{"text":"I went to this sushi restaurant because of it's reviews on Yelp but do not believe the hype! This place is not that great at all. I was very disapointed. I have been on a quest to find a new sushi place since moving to Goodyear from the east side. I have to say I was sorely let down. When I entered the restaurant on a Saturday at about 4pm it was completely dead..we were the only patrons and I knew that was a bad sign. The server was ok..he seemed more interested in folding napkins then waiting on us. The sushi cook had to be called out from the back of the kitchen, decor was lacking and ambiance was even worse. The sushi lacked punch..it was \"ok\" but absolutely nothing special. I ordered the rainbow roll and was disapointed in the dry rice, very small pieces and bland taste. I would not recommend this place to anyone and will continue my search for a decent sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Totally love this place! There are a lot of sushi places in the West Valley now...especially around the Goodyear area, but ah-hai has the best happy hour by far! Not only do they have the best prices, but their happy hour is all night, every night! That is really hard to beat! Their rolls and apps are good...I especially like their calamari (it's in sticks, not rings) and the seaweed salad.   I always go for happy hour, but their other rolls and entrees look really good too!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for several years now since moving into the area and it never disappoints. These days I mostly get my food for take-out on Friday nights, but I have occasionally dined in as well. I prices are close to or slightly better than average for sushi in the valley, but the quality is excellent. I especially like their tako nigiri because it is always consistent where as a lot of other places I have been to have rather small and dry portions of it.  I have only at the sushi bar when I dined in, but the service was friendly and attentive. They do seem to get busy on Friday nights, however, they have a lot of servers working on the busy nights even though the restaurant is fairly small which is nice. If you dine in, they have two TV's that have been set to a sports channel every time I have been there.  There were other places in the valley I used to stop by on the way home from work to get sushi, but this has become my favorite. In fact, the only places I can say I have had better sushi was in Los Angeles and Japan. If you are ever in the area and are craving good sushi, I recommend giving this a try."}
{"text":"Unless there's something really bad about a place (cleanliness, service, etc.), I think it's really difficult to rate a sushi joint.  Let's face it, we're talking about raw fish and rice.  There's only so much you can do to make them taste like anything more than bland without completing hiding the fish and rice.  So, I always take reviews slamming the taste of a sushi bar's food with a large grain of salt.  And I'm afraid you're not going to be able to get a whole lot out of my review either.  I love sushi, but I'm no connoisseur; more like the uncouth hick who came to your ritzy wedding.  I could easily pop sushi rolls into my mouth, one after the other, like you would M&Ms.  The two of us had SEVEN (7) different rolls tonight; and while I was quite content (especially with a total bill of $45, including soda, 2 miso soups and a house salad), I could've easily eaten another plate, no problem.  Long philosophical speeches aside, the happy hour rolls are reasonably generous (remember:  I'm a glutton) and well worth their prices and service is very attentive and very fast. The only issue was when the waitress asked me twice if I wanted a refill and I thought she was asking if I wanted a wafer (my Polish partner is Catholic, but I'm not, so why would I want a wafer [and wine?] after my meal?).  I guess it takes one foreigner to understand another, because he finally chirped in and said \"refill, refill!\"  Ambience is nothing to talk about.  The place is clean, if not also utilitarian and there's more room than in most sushi places I've been to.  We went on a Sunday evening around 6pm and this seemed to mark the \"Bring your family and 200 relatives with you\" hour, but the crowd did not deter the chefs from quickly making the food nor the waitresses from delivering it.  I would say that if you're a real \"expert\" at sushi, this place's food might be a bit too \"bourgeois\" for you (and if you know what I mean by that, you might be the person I'm referring to).  Since I like to use lots of wasabi, I guess, by default, I'm not too picky about fine distinctions in taste.  If, however, you think sushi should be eaten like pizza rolls at a Monday night football game with a beer or two (or six) to wash them down, the quality of the food and the prices will surely send you into fits of ecstasy with uncontrolled giggling about your good fortune at having found this place.  Goodyear has an amazing number of sushi restaurants to choose from and, apparently, the audience to appreciate it, since even Fry's food store has a freshly-made sushi stand.  Whatever the reason for this, I consider myself lucky to be in the middle of it and don't ask questions.  This restaurant can proudly hold its head high in comparison to its competitors and I find other reviews complaining about blandness or \"just OK\" to be questionable.  If this place isn't good enough for you, I'll be glad to point you to some great sushi bars in  New York, where -- some 30 years ago -- me and a date would pay over $80 for two nigiris and two cocktails.  Count your blessings!"}
{"text":"We just had a great happy hour dinner on a Saturday night. The prices were amazingly low. The quality of the nigiri was pretty good. The rolls were great. Good value overall. Not the best sushi ever, but the best we've had in a while in the West Valley (Tomo is a little higher quality, but you'll pay more for it.) Service=fast, attentive, kind. Best service of any local sushi spot. Very pleased.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Love the sushi here and like that there's never a wait to sit down but the service has been really slow lately."}
{"text":"Really good sushi! I hadn't found a place I loved since I moved here from Cali and I missed their assortment terribly. But I looked up reviews and found this place close to home. They had great attentive service, good quality fresh sushi, and awesome choices on the happy hour menu. I recommend the dynomite roll, rainbow roll, pork gyozas, philadelphia roll...i forget the names of what else i ordered but it is all really good and i have tried a lot of sushi places before. it is very small in there, but cozy. i ordered green tea ice cream for dessert and they put whipped cream and chocolate syrup and cherries and brought us free fancy sliced oranges with the check. it is the little things that count....attention to detail! great job, ah-hai!"}
{"text":"Great sushi joint.  Clean, fresh, tasty fish."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight and loved it! We arrived at 5:30, the place was packed,  but we were seated inmediately. The staff and our waitress were not overly friendly but very efficient, so no complaints there! Now, I have to say that I am always leery about having Sushi in a strip mall no where near the ocean, but It was my 1husband's pick tonight, so went along with it! We ordered the Crunch Roll to share and I ordered the Phoenix Roll. Both rolls were fresh and delicious. My husband had the Spicy Roll and said it was delicious. This restaurant had a steady stream of customers waiting to eat here, I am glad we got there early and will definitely be back soon !"}
{"text":"Went during happy hour, CHEAP sushi (rolls were $3-7), good sushi and service was very good and fast!  And beers were only $1.95 :)  Even the \"non-happy-hour\" prices weren't bad, only a buck or two more  2 people filled up on sushi, 2 beers, and miso soup all for $20?!  yep we'll be back for sure when the sushi cravings hit, which is often"}
{"text":"Definitely some of the best sushi we've found in the area so far. Can't beat the happy hour pricing!"}
{"text":"Good sushi at a great price! The staff is very friendly. I'm not a sushi expert, but for an affordable price it's a good sushi place."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. I've tried many of the different sushi on the menu, and the Thunder Roll is my favorite. It's the best sushi I've ever had with just the right amount of heat to it. Service is always really good. We generally do takeout and it's always ready when we go in."}
{"text":"Awesome! GREAT FOOD. Exceptional service. Good sushi joints are hard to find in the West Valley, but Ah Hai is the best of the best. The prices are low, the fish is fresh, and the beer is cold. Check out their Happy Hour for even lower prices. Don't waste your time anywhere else. Ah Hai is where it's at!"}
{"text":"This is one of families favorite spots. The happy hour sushi is always good, sake bombs are always a good drink. If you don't like sushi their fried rice is pretty good too. Def a place to check out, especially if you are on the west side of town."}
{"text":"We love this place as an affordable family dinner. They recognize us when ever we come in! The happy hour is amazing! It's sometimes difficult to have an experienced wait staff but they are always so busy it's easy to be understanding."}
{"text":"First time here and I had the Wally roll. It was AMAZING and the rolls are cheap! Great sushi for a great price. I will be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The best place in Goodyear!! The staff is welcoming and courteous. The prices and quality are outstanding. My favorite items include the Salmon Skin Rolls and Ninja Jalapenos!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the West Valley. Happy hours every day great food great drinks great service. Please support this Westvalley sushi restaurant so the best I've ever been to"}
{"text":"This place is a regular for my family and I, the food is great and the service is good."}
{"text":"They don't have sunomono! No cucumber salad! The miso soup was watery, where's the miso? All the rolls are tiny, and very basic. Unmemorable"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from from here last weekend and it was just ok. I mean the prices were good anywhere from $3-$9 a roll so I'm definitely not complaining about that.  Their were several rolls ordered but the one that should probably receive a 4 star rating was the crazy roll (with jalapeños) That one was tasty. The California roll was not appetizing at all because it was simply the piece of imitation crab meat in the roll. Normally when I've ordered a Cali roll the crab meat is a mix and it very tasty. This one was not. Maybe it's just not a place to order Cali rolls.  I've definitely had better sushi with great pieces a few exits down the road. Will I be going back? Probably not anytime soon. :( I'm still not sure why it's averaging 4 stars."}
{"text":"Have been here 3 times now and very consistent in taste and flavor. Always good! Took my kids there as well they loved the beef bowl and ice cream. Plan on making this our go to sushi place."}
{"text":"We love this place we go on the weekly deals on sushi are amazing and the service is excellent... DefinitelyRecommend!!!"}
{"text":"We are traveling through Goodyear and wanted some sushi. We came here at Happy Hour and was very much satisfied with the service and food. The prices were very fair.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for good sushi."}
{"text":"Great little sushi hot spot. The service is excellent and the open kitchen allows for fun watching the preparation. They always seem to be busy with an urban feel - refreshing for Goodyear. Try the Pink Lady for something new."}
{"text":"This place has a crazy good happy hour! The only down side is that it's a little far from where I live, but definitely worth the drive. Sushi is cheap & tastes amazing. The place is across a big target and inside the small restaurant complex."}
{"text":"Sushi that almost rivals Seattle, hard to find that in Phoenix but they do a great job, one of the best Japanese restaurant happy hours anywhere in terms of price.   Servers are not very cheery otherwise I'd give them 5 stars but I sort of understand considering how busy they are."}
{"text":"I am updating my review because I have dined here so many times now and they have gotten better and better over the years. The customer service is great. I also, want to help support our local businesses. The food now is delicious and great portions. We've  become accustomed to our favorites dishes the shrimp tempura and our most recent addition thunder roll. I love the Yaki soba noodles that come with a salad and miso soup. We enjoy the atmosphere and are regulars here."}
{"text":"This little restaurant tucked in the plaza with Target and Petsmart is a great option for sushi.  The prices are very reasonable.  I have been here many times and quality of their sushi is consistently good.  I would recommend trying the Pink Lady roll, Squid salad, and Seaweed salad.  The noodles are also good and come with a side said and miso soup.  This is the perfect place for takeout or to dine in.  The service is also generally fast even when they are busy on a weekend night."}
{"text":"Favorite sushi spot in the West Valley. Made with fresh ingredients, fast & friendly service. They have a variety of options and great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Fresh, well prepared sushi.  Our three favs...Tiger Roll, Crazy Roll and the Yuma Roll.  Love the squid salad and combo fried rice."}
{"text":"Had the lunch Tempura bento box and a spicy yellowtail roll and all were very good. Was disappointed they do not have fresh iced tea and it is instant.  Enjoyed our visit and enjoy having a place close to home so will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food tasted great. Service was awful, sat for 10 min before drink order, 15 min before food order and the 30 min for sushi... been here for lunch and had a good experience. So right now will leave at 3 stars due to service and try again before final review."}
{"text":"Great sushi at a great price! We got an assortment of rolls and they were all good. We also had sake bombs and they were so cheap!! We will definitely be returning to this place."}
{"text":"I promise I am going to give this place another shot at providing a better experience.  I always want to write a great review of a place.  Their sushi was really good, although i took it to go, it might have been even better if i ate it there.  There seems to be a pretty good happy hour menu that is on my list of happy ours to try.  As I was waiting, I noticed the music was loud, so conversations might be a little hard to have here.  The prices are pretty much in line with other valley sushi restaurants.  So I hope to actually dine in and upgrade my review."}
{"text":"Like coming here for happy hour. Service is good, not excellent but okay enough that I come back. Guess the saying is true, you get what you pay for. I'm not a huge sushi person, but there sushi was delicious."}
{"text":"Got the lunch roll special to go! Rolls were good, miso was good, salad dressing was good, but the iceberg lettuce was pretty sad. All in all a great deal for $7.95!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I love it so much. It has great sushi and the price is fantastic! The server was nice too. Really friendly. I love the atmosphere of the place too. Will definitely be back many times. Thank You!"}
{"text":"This place got really good reviews so we decided to give it a try.  I don't know if we just ordered the wrong stuff or the sushi chef was having a bad day or what but I really didn't think their rolls were all that good.  We ordered a few rolls from their happy hour menu: Philadelphia, crunch, California and some sort of shrimp/avocado roll.  The rice was dry and had no flavor!  I think they forgot the vinegar!    We also ordered the following:  Edamame: I've never seen so many of the beans out of its pod!  It tasted about par with other places though.  Gyoza: I always thought they were different (but similar) to Chinese dumplings but here, it was EXACTLY like a Chinese dumpling.  Tasted OK.  Veggie fried rice: They used really sticky (I'm assuming sushi) rice to make it.  I wouldn't mind it so much if I wanted sticky rice but we ordered fried rice ... usually the rice is a lot looser.  Miso soup: really bland and I am one who usually prefers bland food.  Seaweed salad: By far my favorite.  At other places it's usually a huge salad entrée so it was nice they had a small side of it I could order.  Great flavor.  Perfection.  I would at least give this place a try again.  I just can't imagine this place getting such good reviews but the sushi tasting the way it did.  I can only assume it was an off day.  The service was good though and they have booth seats which is always a plus when you  have a toddler!  On the (far) West side, my barometer for good sushi is usually comparing the new place I try to Tomo's off of Dysart/McDowell, the Japanese food restaurant we frequent most."}
{"text":"We loved this sushi restaurant!!!! We were in Phoenix on business and found them highly recommended on yelp. They have an awesome happy hour with plenty of choices. The fried jalapeños and gyoza were amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was just ok. I did like their Boston roll. My first time trying it and I loved it. My friend liked the dragon roll. The server wasn't very good. She was a little nice but seemed moody and I think she was new. She didn't really know what was in any of the sushi rolls. Understandable if she's new. I might come back because it wasn't horrible."}
{"text":"The food was ok at best... I try to give ppl the benefit and say maybe our female server was having an off or bad day but it seemed pretty rude to me that I said thank you at least half a dozen times and never got a \"your welcome\" once back and even at that she would just walk away..  Also as me and my coworker dined they would only give us one of things, one menu, one wasabi and ginger tray? Even the customer behind me were complaining that all the people at the table received their food and even finished it and they forgot about her... The tuna was kind of tough, and the rest of the food didn't have much flavor, above all the service was terrible and I won't be returning when I'm in town..."}
{"text":"We went back to Ah Hai a few days ago after trying different sushi restaurants in the area. I think the big draw of non-luxury Sushi restaurants like this is Happy Hour. I've docked a star for a couple reasons.  Selection - Happy Hour menu is smaller than average. Would like to see more of the popular selections on there.   Quality - I will try to post a picture of the Rainbow roll we recently had. It was about half the size of most Rainbow rolls you can get. The color of the fish was dull. Not as bright and vibrant as you would like to see. The fish was really thin, not much there to get a taste of.   Value - The menu is expensive considering the product that is delivered. It's not a good value.  Overall the place is OK. They have slightly different Happy Hour times, so if you miss Happy Hour at one of your other places and really need a sushi fix, this place will suffice. In my opinion though, there are a lot of Sushi restaurants in the area in close proximity. To get the business you have to either provide a top product if you are going to charge a premium for it, or be what you are and provide cheap sushi for a cheap price."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times. The food is always really good and the prices are quite reasonable"}
{"text":"We have been coming here since they opened.  I have enjoyed lots of sushi bars, but this one has the best salmon ever, its always super tender and melts in your mouth.  Tried the new Hawaiian roll today, it is amazing!  Great happy hour specials all night. This has become our favorite sushi destination."}
{"text":"A little sushi joint with a really great happy hour ~  When I'm in a town that I'm not familiar with I always look to yelp. I was really in the mood for sushi & this was the closest place to me with decent reviews. I will say that they have a really great happy hour with lots to choose from and very affordable rolls starting at just $5!   I ordered two rolls from the HH menu and both were good. My only complaint would be too much fake crab all over them and too much eel & spicy mayo covering up every other flavor. Both rolls were pretty large and there were too many similar options on the HH menu as far as rolls go. I suggest offering a few items with ponzu or spicy garlic sauce instead of eel and mayo sauces.   The restaurant was clean but pretty boring when it came to decor. I'm always sad to see no creativity but the service was good. So my experience wasn't bad but also wasn't very memorable and I didn't gush over anything."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's quaint and a hidden gem! Love the misso soup and salad dressing they put on their small salads. The menu items are all delicious!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best sushi place i've eaten at.  They have great customer service, which is a biggie for me. I will definiitely be a once a weeker.. :)   The place is very clean as well... Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great service!! Sushi is amazing. Sushi is very cheap during happy hour compared to other sushi bars. Must try the thunder roll!"}
{"text":"You would never this was here unless you looked for it. Hidden right by a Super Target... I come here all the time. This is, by far, the best sushi place in the West Valley you could hope to eat at. The sushi is fresh, the place is clean. The only reason why I don't give this place 5 stars is the fact the servers there are bland, and unwelcoming."}
{"text":"Great sushi! I had the terriaki salmon with steamed vegetables and it was delicious! The portions are generous and the entrees come with soup and salad. I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"Love love love his place! Been coming here for 2 years, and never disappoints! The BEST happy hour ever!! Love that business is booming, and don't mind the wait for the excellent sushi!!"}
{"text":"The service wasn't all that great and the sushi wasn't anything to write home about either. The lady that served us tried to be funny but was sort of rude. She felt too comfortable with us I think. I'm all for being personable, but I am still a guest and expect to be treated as such and not just a \"bro\"..."}
{"text":"Best Sushi in the West Valley! It's one of the west valleys hidden gems in my opinion, Great tasting sushi, Great service and Great portions. I've been to a lot of sushi places around the west valley and none compare to this place. Good price on entrees & sushi. You won't be disappointed. I would recommend the Tiger roll, scorpion roll or Rainbow roll. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in the service I received at this restaurant.  I went to celebrate my daughters birthday. I was told over the phone that I couldn't make a reservation so I showed up at 5:45 to put my name down but was told they wouldn't take my name until my entire party was there. By 6:05 my party had arrived so I let the host know. We had two people added to the party so I let the host  know. At 6:45, after watching other families who came in later them us get seated, I asked the host what was taking so long. She said because of the size of the our party, we needed two tables. I watched two table become empty and cleaned and two other families be seated. Several minutes later I asked why I wasn't given the option of having those two tables since I had obviously been waiting the longest. The host told me that the manager said since we added two more people then originally expected we had to sit at the back table. The people At the back table hadn't even started eating yet. We had already waited more then an hour and would likely have to wait at least another 30 minutes. I asked to talk to the manager, she refused her name. She was very  unapologetic and just kinda shrugged her shoulders as to say, nothing I can do about it. Well... myself and my party of 16 decided to walk out and eat somewhere else. By this time it was 7:40. I was so turned off by the lack of customer service here, I will never return to this location. I will also tell everyone I know about this experience."}

{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!  OK so you want to know why?  The staff is wonderful and they are as friendly as it gets.  The sushi chef is a wizard and everything he makes will melt in your mouth.  everything is so fresh and carefully made . They could use some help on the lack of decor but when the food is this good its obvious where the money goes. personally i love their small salad its $1.00 and the best dollar spent i say, this ginger dressing is home made everyday and sold for $3.00 . This place is a mom and pop gem. i suggest this place to any sushi lover."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Goodyear and I was looking for a sushi place, not the best sushi I've ever had, however, their happy hour prices are well worth it. I recommend to not go for the cheapest ones if you want to enjoy a good roll. Service was O.K. I'd come back for sure."}
{"text":"OMG!! We had to ignore our plant-based diet to enjoy their yummy soft shell crab  prepared in a lightly battered crust!! Great selection, fresh and affordable! When fully disciplined, we enjoy many veggie dishes here!  West Side Valley Love Ah Hai Sushi & Grill!!"}
{"text":"The sushi is good, but the price is better.  This place is always busy, so adjust your patience levels.   The carry out timing is on point, so if you're within 10 miles, this place would be the best to pick up some tasty, affordable sushi that's about mid-grade level."}
{"text":"Im only giving it four stars cause the place could use a little light. Its so dark in there i could barely read my menu. But the dynamite roll was a hit for me!"}
{"text":"Just picked up a to go order that was packed excellent and ample wasabi. Thought  my sushi days were over when I moved to Goodyear AZ from So Cal, but I am wrong after this order.  Price are good and place looked nice.  Definitely were order in next time, soon I hope."}
{"text":"Not fancy but good. Prices are reasonable.  Seems to be a popular place. Not a lot of ambiance but prices are reasonable. I like Tomos a bit better but in Goodyear this would be my second choice."}
{"text":"The eel and yellow tail pieces were brownish and the rice fell apart. The sushi here is consistently poor quality (I've been 5-6 times living nearby) I don't understand why it got \"super fresh\" label, maybe we just showed up on the \"wrong\" days?"}
{"text":"Every sushi place I eat at is compared to Ah Hai. They are the best, price- and taste-wise! Whenever I try new things I'm never disappointed, but I love to stick to my beloved favorite Cotton roll and miso soup. My friends love it and my family does too. Plus it's so close to us! Cute decor and Yuki is great. If you've never gone here, try it, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, was seated at the sushi bar, waited 12 minutes, made lots of eye contact with waitresses, no acknowledgement, no drink, no go to hell, NOTHING! can't comment on the food or drink quality since I wasn't offered either!"}
{"text":"Our go-to sushi place. It's a great neighborhood spot.. The restaurant is clean, service is friendly and sushi is really good!! The spicy girl is my favorite!!! And agree with the other reviewers in saying go during happy hour. The prices can't be beat."}
{"text":"This one of my favorites. The food is delicious and service is commendable. It is small but comfortable place."}
{"text":"This place is really good! With pretty good prices and great happy hour menu!  I was impressed! They are friendly and quick to seat you and get your drinks. The sushi is fresh and if you have questions they answer with no problems.  They were a tad busy but even then the service was great!"}
{"text":"Bento Lunch Box, warm Saki. Delicious, quick, and elegant. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Best place to get fresh sushi! They have list and list of sushi and other plates. It takes time to get your sushi because there is a lot of people. I recommend to get a entree for example potstickers (which are my favorite only from here) and be eating while you wait for sushi. Other then that this place is the place to go in goodyear if you are a sushi lover."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Wonderful food, and they have amazingly creative and artistic sushi that is also filling.  And I don't even like sushi!  Best asian restaurant I've visited."}
{"text":"This is a great little hidden gem of goodyear. Been coming here since the place opened and every time we come it had been nothing short of amazing and super fresh. The ice cream tempura is a must!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic prices.  It's rare that two people can walk out of a sushi joint stuffed after spending less than $40.  It's not THE best sushi in Goodyear, but it trounces a lot of (much more expensive) other offerings, for sure.  Great service, too.  We'll be regulars here."}
{"text":"This place is my usually sushi spot until tonight. I don't usually order after 9:30pm but I got out of work unusually late. The waitress on the phone could've let me know that they closed in ten minutes when I called at 9:49pm, but she didn't. She took my order like it was NO PROBLEM (which I appreciated). I thought they closed at 10:30pm but tonight they happened to close at 10pm because it was a weekday (which I found out once I got to the restaurant). I got my food, paid and left. I was EXTREMELY UPSET to find out that my spicy tuna roll was 1/4 spicy tuna and 3/4 rice. If they were going to halfass my roll I would've preferred they tell me that they weren't taking orders anymore. Instead, they take my order and give me shitty sushi that is ALL RICE. I'm very disappointed and don't plan on going there anymore. I'm a regular and while I should know the hours, I usually don't worry about it since I usually dine in on weekends. I just can't believe this is something they'd serve a customer. It's quite insulting and I would recommend that everyone check their food before just picking it up and taking it home. Fucking outrageous!"}
{"text":"What a great discovery this place has been!  It is hidden away in the little strip mall that is off of Cotton Lane and Yuma Road in Goodyear.  But don't let it's hidden location fool you.  I've now been two times and enjoyed myself and their food on both occasions.  My sushi date friend, Cyndie, and I wanted to try this place after having a horrific experience at Blu Sushi (see my review for the full story) and we were desperate to find a new place that had that \"it\" sushi.  We seriously found it!  We went for their happy hour and ordered several different rolls including my necessity (especially when trying out a new sushi bar), spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura roll, and crunchy roll.  All three of them were attractive and tasty.    But we weren't full and wanted to order another roll, so we ordered the Pink Lady roll off of the regular menu.  It was brought out to us and set down on the table and the two of us couldn't close our mouths or stop staring.  The rolls were in pink soypaper, shaped as hearts, and had a blinking light in the center.  It was gorgeous and...a sushi place that has fun with their presentation by decorating the plates?!  Heck yeah!  We were impressed and it was very good.  The Pink Lady has cucumber, avocado, crab, and crunch wrapped w/soy bean paper, Eel sauce & spicy mayo.  It was incredibly delicious...did I already say that?  We were hooked for sure and both decided we'd be coming back to try more.  On our 2nd trip, we ordered the Pink Lady again...I'm pretty sure this will be my mainstay everytime I come.  But we also ordered the Scorpion Roll - shrimp tempura, cream cheese, inside topped w/kani, masago in spicy mayo & eel sauce (which had an amazing decoration on it...I think it was a lobster), sweet potato roll, and California rolls (for a friend...but they weren't flavorful as was expected).  The scorpion roll melted in our mouths.  There was a little too much cream cheese for my liking, but still very good.  All the plates had fun decorations added...one was made to look like a butterfly using the rolls.  There's something about this added touch that makes me appreciate them even more.  The service is great and the servers we have had are very nice and welcoming as well.  I will be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"This place is so good. Happy hour rolls were great, although not a huge choice of them. They're is a lot more on the regular menu."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. The sushi was fresh and the happy hour prices make eating here very reasonable. Had the Yaki-Soba noodles with chicken, some spicy tuna rolls and Bud Lite...  $20 with tip... And yes! It was good!"}
{"text":"So yummy! My son got me hooked! I love the thunder roll! I have had this place 3 times in 2 weeks can't seem to get enough! The pricing is not over the top and well worth it! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We moved to the area recently & have been here a few times. Sushi is great and reasonable! My husband is not a sushi fan, but they have quite a few meat dishes. The happy hour menu is great! Only downside is that I've had to wait for a table every time I've ben there, but was seated in a decent amount of time...it's a small restaurant so it's understandable."}
{"text":"Phenomenal. Food was prepared quickly, and presentation was still perfect. Our waitress was accommodating without being annoying. We ordered pork katsu, a scorpion roll, edamame, and gyoza. The pork katsu will feed two, it is huge. Definitely recommend and we will be coming back."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour!love the ninja jalapeños! I love green tea, but the green tea taste like tap water! Which is a bummer because I love green tea. Other  than that I love this place"}
{"text":"Best sushi bar I have found in Goodyear. I love the employees, the environment, and happy hour specials! I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Upon fist arrival i was skeptical of this stripmall sushi joint... but I was wrong. It was delicious!! Amazing happy hour prices for select rolls... we order 7 rolls and it was less than 50 bucks. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I didn't really care for this place's sushi, sashimi, and yakisoba. The yakisoba didn't have traditional yakisoba noodles and the dish had a lot of grease and tasted more like Chinese food (lo mein). Also the service didn't help my impression of this place, we had to sit for 15 minutes waiting for a table and when we did get a table our waitress barely checked on us. We walked up to the register to pay for our food after eating and waited 10 minutes. We could've walked out of there without anyone knowing but I'm honest so I had to stand and wait around. My time is very valuable to me. Luckily I was just passing thru."}
{"text":"Food is always good.  Good prices for what you get.  Everyone is very friendly.  I go there often for lunch meetings.  It's never so busy that you have to wait which is awesome."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of sushi joints, this place is by far top 5, great food, unique twists, great presentation, attentive service and 3 DOLLAR ROLLS! Everyday. I'll be going back, weekly."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Goodyear, the food was fresh, the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Great specials for happy hour, everyday from 3-6 pm. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"My second time here and I'm so.thrilled that I went back! The snow white roll was incredible! The service is great, very friendly! I am looking forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Love this sushi restaurant. Food is always delicious and very affordable. My husband and I go at least twice a month. Yuki the owner is very nice and hospitable. I highly recommend this restaurant. Definitely my favorite sushi restaurant to go to!!!"}
{"text":"When we started coming here this place was empty but slowly this place started getting busy. We enjoy the sushi here. The rolls are good and the sashimi is fresh. The kids love the steak teriyaki and the Japanese soda with the marble. The service is always good. People are friendly and nice. Try this place for happy hour as the sushi and rolls are discounted."}
{"text":"We just moved here from California and found our spot! The food is delicious and the service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I ate lunch here a couple days ago and neither one of us was very impressed with the hibachi steak plates (no flavor) or the service. The only saving grace was the spider roll and crunchy roll, both were good and the rice was done right. We may give it another chance, maybe it was an off day for everyone."}
{"text":"This is our best kept secret. We affectionately refer to this place as discount sushi place. They're convenient, the fish is fresh, and it's always good. They have odd hours, as far as dinner and lunch and being closed for an hour or two in between.   Everyone here works hard and is good at their job. We love this joint."}
{"text":"hello everyone I went there yesterday for  dinner I got the combination they open ffor dinner at 4 pm if you  know we had fun  we go there because we like the selection and the food"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here at least twice a month on average for the last year. I get Miso soup for starters which is always fresh and hot. My favorite roll is the scorpion roll which is the first thing I mark down on their happy hour menu. The customer service is excellent and really fast. I would pick this place over any other sushi place in AZ. -Berto"}
{"text":"California Roll with soy paper! Can you say  Delicious! The food is so fresh. I've had the chicken fried rice it is so authentic so good so fresh and very reasonably priced. It is too good if I could be here three times a week I probably would. Highly recommended friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Great Sushi in Goodyear. The miso soup was very good and their portions are a good size for the money. Though I must say the star of the night was the sushi. The decor is very nice and clean. Did I mention the salad has an incredible dressing? Well worth a trip and you will leave full and not like you spent a lot of money."}
{"text":"Should've left when we were seated - it was a sign. First of all, we were asked if a small table was ok... yeah, of course it is. Not a problem. What the problem actually was where the table was located. It was probably 8 inches from another table and RIGHT BEHIND the hostess stand. Everytime the door opened I got a cold breeze, it was miserable. We laughed it off and ordered: gyoza, thunder roll, spicy tuna roll, and teriyaki chicken. Let me give you a breakdown of the food. Gyoza: YES! It was really good. I loved the sauce that comes with it. It's also on the happy hour menu so it was 3.50, I think. Regardless, I would recommend. ] Thunder roll: I'm from Alaska - I like fishy flavors. But this tasted strictly of a cheap white fish. The only saving grace was the eel sauce. I had maybe three pieces of the roll and got nausea so I stopped. Spicy tuna roll: Ew. Just ew. The tuna was mushy and just plain gross. I had two pieces and called it a night. Teriyaki chicken: I tried this but I wasn't the one who ordered it. It tasted like the cheapest chicken - my boyfriend didn't even come close to finishing it nor did we get a to-go container.  The service was ok, she was busy which is understandable but we never even got our water refilled... come on.  The best thing was probably the orange they give at the end.   Will never be coming back, save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a serious review from someone who is serious about their sushi.  I can see why this place is popular, it's pandering to the pallets of people who want to tell their Instagram friends they had sushi last night.  They use so much sauce, different kinds of sauce, and flavorings that the fish is completely lost.  Most of the rolls have these treatments.  I tried the Hawaii roll just to keep from being a hypocrite and although it was good, I couldn't tell you what was in there.  Also had the yellow tail and tuna rolls, the fish was not discernible.  Yes they are both types of tuna but there is supposed to be a flavor difference.    Sake selection is sad at best.    Atmosphere feels cheap and neglected.  I'm fairly certain someone's 11 year old daughter made the playlist.  I've heard Justin Bieber, Kelly Clarkson, and the Frozen song.     The wait staff is where this place shines, they are attentive and friendly.  As far as the kitchen goes, I can't really comment, I had some edamame which isn't really reviewing the kitchen.  But what I will say is that there were a couple of small pieces of broccoli and a fairly large piece of onion in there.  Little concerning."}
{"text":"This is solid 4 rating and the portions are quite large! My wife and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"It's a casual and relaxing atmosphere. The food is delicious and the service was fast."}
{"text":"The food was terrible I order 4 hibachi chicken to go  I got no utensil or napkins the chicken was disgusting no flavor it was tuff to eat I do not recommend this nasty place to anybody."}
{"text":"A great place to eat, and there happy hour specials can't be beat. You can get a lot of food of 20 dollars. Best sushi restaurant in town."}
{"text":"Great food, great happy hour sushi and prices. We've eaten here several times and each time it's the best! Friendly staff, easy pick orders as well."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful find & I owe it all to Yelp and other reviewers!!!  My sister and I were looking for something new to try. Usually we end up in the east valley or central Phoenix. We were on the west side when I decided to see what Yelp suggested. What a marvelous,  little hidden gem!! I haven't had calamari this tender since I was out east! The portions of food are generous, the prices are reasonable and the service is amazing!! We decided to try a lunch special which came with miso, a salad and your choice of 2 sushi rolls. We arrived there at 2pm and they close for a brief period around 3pm. They never made us feel rushed and I'm certain our food was every bit as good as their first customer of the day!!"}
{"text":"I love sushi!  I wasn't uber impressed this time.  Their seaweed was a little bit chewy which is not typical of this place.    The Cotton Roll didn't disappoint.  It was well rolled and didn't fall apart, as was the Shrimp Tempura Roll.  I know a Philly roll isn't all that complicated but this one lacked something.  We did go for lunch, so the prices were great.  They have a lunch special where you choose 2 rolls from a list of selected rolls/sashimi and also get a salad and miso soup (salad dressing is da' bomb!) and all this for only $7.95.    We ordered a side of fried rice...if possible,  next time I'd ask if they can leave out the onions...way too many raw onions and no me gusta raw onions!   Next time you're in the far west valley...stop by and say \"Ahhhh Haiii!\" to this place!  I will be going back and hopefully the seaweed isn't chewy cuz I'll have to say, \"Ahhhh...byeeeee!\""}
{"text":"I went here last week with my boyfriend and his family. The prices are a steal. Half off rolls--I was sold. But it was very easy to order a lot and fill up quickly. I was a bit trigger happy and the bill still ended up the same as the places I order back home. Nonetheless, I left full and stayed full for a long time.  We ordered the dragon, Philadelphia, California, rainbow, thunder, and crunchy rolls. They were way more than enough for 2 people.   Only thing that sucked was we asked the waitress to change the channel on the TV, and she had no clue what we were asking. So she just changed the channel to a random basketball game. Other than that, I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Went in w a coupon for our 1st time.  Hubby had sushi, he Loved.  I had tempura and soup.  Small place but big tsste"}
{"text":"The food isn't even edible. I ordered to go and when I started on my meal(lunch), it was like chewing on rubber (Hibachi chicken). They left all the condiments or utensils. I wouldn't recommend anyone to eat here. The is completely disgusting."}
{"text":"There are at least six sushi restaurants closer to us, but Ah Hai Sushi and Grill is definitely worth the extra drive.  It has quickly become my family's favorite sushi restaurant.  Ah Hai serves very fresh and delicious food at a very reasonable price.  The staff are very friendly and my family has always had a pleasant experience dining there.   My wife enjoys their Scorpion Roll the best.  I like the Beef Negimaki.  If we dine during lunch, we use the $5.00 off $25.00 coupon that is always available.  If we dine during dinner, then it's Happy Hour pricing all evening long.  Happy to have a 5 STAR sushi restaurant in the West Valley!"}
{"text":"We love this location. It's a 20 minute drive from our home but we always go out of our way to eat here. We've never had any negative experiences at this location. The staff is always helpful and efficient. The food is the same all of the time and no concerns with their prices. They have amazing happy hour sushi prices and the plum wine is tasty.  We're always satisfy when we leave."}
{"text":"The food was very very good, I went there because I have the entertainment book. Buy one get one free but I did not read the fine print. Only some items were listed so that was not good. The good thing is that we went during happy hour and the prices for sushi were really low. The sushi is very delicious. I would go back for sushi during happy hour"}
{"text":"Always great food, but don't trust them on the phone. Called in on what time they close and the lady told me 9:30 but got there and it was closing at 9:00. Drove 30 mins out of my way. Not cool at all. Won't get my business again."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!  The best sushi in the valley and for a very affordable price!  Their happy hour menu is ridiculously cheap and makes it possible to drop in with the whole family to eat!  The only negative is the restaurant is very small inside and because the word has spread about the great sushi it's often very packed inside."}
{"text":"I am very shocked at how disappointing our rolls were. From the reviews I just knew this would be amazing. Now our little ones got shrimp fried rice and it was some of the best I've had in a long time! We went on a Friday night. We ordered, spicy tuna & crab rolls. Crunch roll, and sriracha roll.  The spicy tuna was very bland but ok. The spicy crab was NOT spicy, no flavor at all. The sriracha roll was ok, nothing too special. But the worst thing was the crunch roll, worst I've ever had! My husband and I love our sushi with spice and flavor and this was the exact opposite. I don't see myself going back. :-("}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour deals and good service.  The restaurant itself is a little small, but we've always been seated quickly.  Great place for a quick eat or date when you want sushi but don't want to spend too much!"}
{"text":"Still around and just as good as when it started if not better. It has become a staple in the neighborhood. Love that it's still family owned and run. Great happy hour prices that continue until close."}
{"text":"First time eating at ah hai, and I must say it was good. Size of Restaurant was a little small but can't complain. Service was quick considering how packed they were. Sushi rolls was delicious & fresh, nigiri sushi was fresh, masago was fresh. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Second time eating here this week. It's one of our fav places - SO GOOD! We get various rolls: philly, thunder, nessa, yellowtail, etc. Tried the beef fried rice for the first time and loved it! Gets quite busy on weekends but worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent for the price. Not the best sushi I've ever had. However, their happy hour prices are well worth it. Additionally, their chicken teriyaki has been traditionally pretty good. As long as you go in with expectations of decent sushi for low prices, you'll be very happy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sushi joint in AZ. Prices are good, food is great and service is always outstanding. It's a very nice clean place with a great happy hour!!! Everyone is always having fun and willing to chime in on a conversation. I have had several rolls and appetizers but by far my favorite roll is there Goodyear Roll!!!! The Mango really throws a sweet kick in there with the spicy Mayo. My favorite appetizer is the Sliced Octopus over cucumber!!! It's just delicious in every way and they give a hefty portion of octopus which is hard to find. They can get pretty busy any night and it's a little on the small size but I think you get the best service in places like this unlike when you don't see your server for 5 minutes at larger sushi joints. Definitely a must go to Sushi spot for anyone in the west valley!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay, downright horrible management at this restaurant. The serving staff was great. The Teppan Chef from Europe, not so much. We were told 10 minute wait upon arrival for a party of 6. 45 minutes later sat at the Teppan grill area. Another 30 minutes later(no joke, not being exaggerative), the chef shows up. I asked why, and they said they rotate chefs from one area to the next. I was unaware of this practice and would have fined elsewhere had I known. We had the European chef, and his social skills weren't up to par for this type of establishment. Needless to say, I will not be dining here again. No fault to the serving staff, they were all great. It's a shame because this has the feel of an upscale establishment. Just poor management."}
{"text":"Been here twice for happy hour and have been disappointed both times. We had the same server each time and she was terrible, friendly, but just not a good server. I had to ask several times for ice water as I was trying to eat my spicy tuna roll with my mouth on fire. Had to wait for a fork both times, and once was offered training chopsticks instead of the fork I asked for. Both times while not even halfway through my food and wine was asked if I was ready for the check. The second visit resulted in leaving early because I felt I was being rushed out.   The California Roll was made with chunks of the fake crab and the roll itself was very skimpy, the spicy tuna roll had an off flavor and I could not eat it. The prices are cheap during happy hour, but so are the ingredients.  Also, there were 2 to 3 girls just hanging out at the front counter by the door while there was a packed restaurant and they could have been a huge help to the servers."}
{"text":"I went here with my bf for happy hour and although they have a lot on their HH menu, it did not taste good at all! The calamari was dry and tasted like it came from the freezer, the rolls were not fresh, there was a fishy after taste, and their salmon nigiri had an odd flavor to it. I would not recommend this place at all. Worst sushi place in the area. I don't know why they have such high ratings. The service was good but that's the only positive."}
{"text":"This place was really great. It's sort of crowded but the food was delicious and it wasn't too pricey."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good food pretty small restaurant but enjoyed the potstickers and chicken fried rice my son really enjoyed the sushi decently priced great for families too."}
{"text":"The staff was completely unknowledgeable about gluten and what was safe for me to eat. As I kept asking about ingredients, I discovered they use vinegar that contains wheat in their sushi rice and their wasabi isn't safe either. So if you have celiac disease, steer clear. I had water and watched my family eat."}
{"text":"This place has the best lunch specials, and their sushi selection is awesome. Sushi, soup, appetizers are all amazing! I recommend this place to anyone in Goodyear. Service is fast and food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Yuki and Kevin feed our family and neighbors many nights every week! So lucky to have them so close. Very accommodating for dietary restrictions, good quality, and great service. You always feel like a regular."}
{"text":"A pesar de q la mesera era un poco \"distraída\" la comida es muy buena, tienen la hora feliz y puedes encontrar cerveza barata y algunos platillos, me encanto"}
{"text":"Sushi in the West Valley continues to impress!  This place was super busy on a Sunday afternoon, small but nice place, we sat at the sushi bar, again, manned by a couple of Japanese sushi chefs!  We tried a few rolls and they were all very good, good service, and reasonable pricing, will be back!"}
{"text":"Aye here for the first time with friends. Pretty good food and the price isn't to bad. They have a good assortment of different style California rolls. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite place to eat. I come during the happy hour and I'm always satisfied with the one dollar miso soup and great sushi. I come probably 3 times a month."}
{"text":"Good happy hour special. Legit had everything on the happy hour menu plus ramen, fried rice and other apps for about 50 dollars. Sushi was good nothing fancy. They have a pretty basic offerings and some of the rolls where not rolled correctly. The ramen was reported to be good by my sibling.  No complaints there. Would eat here again if I were in the area for lunch."}
{"text":"Great little gem in the West Valley. We came here for their Happy Hour, originally. They offer a HUGE Happy Hour menu at excellent prices. Their Happy Hour is 3:30pm to close every day. We had the California and Avocado rolls- made fresh right at the Sushi bar. The service was good, servers pleasant and helpful and they were right on top of everything. Give it a try- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour last night and I really enjoyed this place.  Service was very prompt and the fid was delicious.  Was my first experience with sushi and I loved it."}
{"text":"Confident that I was served dog food. My girlfriend and I both sent back our \"hibachi steak.\"  We also were served our California rolls about 5 minutes after our main hibachi was brought out.  Yes, this includes after soup and salad.    After we sent our food back, I expected to be asked if I'd like it off the bill or SOMETHING like that ... nope. I asked for the check and was charged full price.    Was hoping to find a gem in Goodyear but I was gifted with a plate of kibbles and bits instead."}
{"text":"I love this place! They have fun and inventive choices, incredibly delicious food and a fantastic happy hour! The prices are incredibly reasonable and the food is high quality and scrumptious. The service is very fast and friendly and everything is very clean and nice inside the restaurant. If you are in the west valley this is definitely a great sushi spot!"}
{"text":"First time here and really really pleased! Awesome happy hour and our server Leo was so helpful and kind. The rolls were excellent. He made great recommendations. We will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"This is our second attempt at this restaurant.  The first experience was ok so we thought we'd try it again.  Well that was a wrong idea.  We were sat by the sushi bar *note do not sit by the sushi bar*.  It was close to the kitchen where the fresh aroma of sewer like water filled the air.  Probably a sign of things to come.  Service was slow.  Server happened to be the same one we got before who again, gave another poor performance.  Slow to take order, and to check out. Luckily being by the bar sped up receiving our sushi orders but still, do not sit by sushi bar.  Fish didn't appear nor taste fresh.  Rolls had a weird after taste.  Fish appeared as if it were sitting out overnight.  Also saw other patron's orders just sitting for several minutes as servers seem to forget about them.  Although happy hour menu is extensive still not worth it.  In fact after heading back home after the meal I didn't feel that great. I hope I don't get food poisoning and have learned my lesson when it comes to this place.  Eat at your own risk.  Really don't understand the high ratings.  Way better sushi elsewhere.  I believe ratings may be due to the HH menu and prices but again you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place ever. Staff is very friendly and food is simply delicious. A must try"}
{"text":"This place has great sushi!! The only reason I am a hayashi hibachi regular is the atmosphere and sushi chefs. My hubby and I have been to both places and the sushi is comparable but the atmosphere isn't.. I do have to say that these guys serve a mean ninja jalapeño. I will go here just for that because u can't get it this good anywhere else. Hayashi is way to spicy for me!! 2 bites and I'm downing glasses of water lol but this place is really good that's why I gave 5 stars"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once per week, but I don't always check in.  Not kidding.  Ah-Hai is great!  I'm a vegetarian, so I haven't tried the real sushi.  But, the veggie rolls are delicious and quite affordable during happy hour (which is pretty much any time after 4).  My kids love the grilled chicken teriyaki and vegetables.    Try the Nessa roll with carrot if you like veggie sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Decent sushi. Decent pricing during happy hour and quick service. Family friendly. Definitely not he beat sushi out there but is a go to when on the area."}
{"text":"High quality, quick service and fair pricing!   Expect a wait later in the week or on weekend evenings as this place has picked up in popularity. Lots of options for sushi and non-sushi eaters here, TVs if you want to watch, and the food is pretty darn delicious for this side of town.  Nice to have such good sushi so close!"}
{"text":"We were out in Goodyear for the first time in forever and checked out Yelp for some eats...all these glowing reviews for Ah Hai so we had to check it out. We were hoping for a great hole-in-the wall find, cranking out fantastic fresh sushi at great prices.   I have to wonder if we went to the same place. The sushi was very mediocre...well prepared, sure, but very similar to what you'd get at a supermarket or any number of places around town where sushi is treated as an afterthought.  Tasteless, unnaturally pink tuna, finely processed pre-made spicy tuna for rolls, etc.  Small slices too. Just not as spectacular as some reviews here made it sound.  The place is small, the decor is a little cold, and it was creepy quiet. On the bright side the kitchen items we had were tasty, and service was cheerful and efficient. Prices were very affordable and the happy hour gives a great discount. But with the 4.5 star Yelp rating we went with high hopes we'd find a hidden gem stuck out in Goodyear, and we found a 3 star, passable but not great sushi joint."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent presentation and atmosphere. Very reasonable prices especially the happy hour which is always on. My favorite roll being that I am mostly vegan with the exception of sushi, was the sweet potato roll. Deep fried yam on sushi rice with unagi sauce melted in my mouth. Lots of umami with that roll and a large selection of other vegan rolls as well. The ONLY reason I didnt give this 5 star's was the lack of uni. Aside from that they were perfect."}
{"text":"My new sushi place! I come here at least twice a month, they have happy hour 4-10 every time I come here and I come here any day of the week! I have ordered the Dynamite, Scorpion, Philadelphia, Pink lady?, spicy tuna, California, and others.  I have yet to be disappointed.  Their sake bombers are super cheap!  The staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Best and most reasonably priced Sushi place in Goodyear. I don't get to go often but when I get a craving for sushi I will head here without hesitation. The staff are nice and the location is convenient. If you come here you can expect to get some quality food for a good price. Also, it's really nice that it feels authentic, kinda miss that in Sushi restaurants with all the focus on fusion and Americanization."}
{"text":"Tasty food, reasonable prices and mostly quick service except one waitress. All others were speedy bringing out entree's but ours just moved more slowly. Pot stickers/dumplings are a must if you visit. We sampled six types of rolls and a chicken dish. Some super yummy bites especially for happy hours M-Sat  from 4:30 to 9:30/close."}
{"text":"First time here! The place is nice not too dark, reasonable priced and the portions are big :) loved everything I tried! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Food (from HH menu):  Albacore Nigiri: 3.5 stars Smooth, good sized piece & tasty.   Tuna Nirgiri: 3 stars Fresh, no fishy smell / taste & good portion size.  Salmon Skin Roll: 2.5 stars There wasn't much salmon skin inside of the rolls but more rice surrounding all of the rolls than anything.   Squid Salad: 3 stars The squid in this salad tasted exactly like the squid salad mixture that Costco has, except this had extra greens on the bottom of the mixture.  Dynamite Roll (Cali roll w/ baked crab on top): 3 stars This had way too much rice & sauce on top which overwhelmed the whole roll.   Overall: clean place with good atmosphere & good sized portioned food here.   If you like rolls more than sashimi then you'll like this place. =)    Service: Very slow, they forgot to check on us during the meal & we had to wave them down several times for water. -1  Tip: HH: M-F 4:30- Closing Sat & Sun: 3PM - Closing"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but will on this one. To be fair, the good stuff first. The restaurant was very well kept up and the wait staff were very attentive and friendly. We also went there during a Friday at 6pm and we're seated at a private table quickly. The calamari appetizer, soup, and salad were very delicious. Then it went downhill... the entrees were terrible! My wife had the shrimp and I had the steak and chicken. We both had rice and mixed vegetables to accompany our meal. The shrimp was rubbery and both the steak and chicken were very dry and grainy. The fried rice was severely overcooked and mixed vegetables were very bland. Though they provided three sauces (including the sauce for the calamari) not to mention the soy sauce on the table, nothing made any of the entree taste better. Both my wife and I ate less than half of what was on our plates. For sixty dollars less, we could have eaten at Panda Express and been much more satisfied. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a great price. Lunch is a great time to go and avoids the dinner rush. I've never had to wait long for any plate and never had a bad roll. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Service was good, place was clean. Service was also fast. The food wasn't bad. We had multiple sushi rolls and appetizers. Price wasn't bad. At the end of your meal, you get an orange already peeled, not sure what that was about, but it was pretty cool."}
{"text":"Finally...after my cousin invites me several times I go ahead and try this with her. I am happy to say that I love this place!  Nice clean and cozy. We had several happy hr deal. Well ee just tried different kinds of rolls and I will say each one was very good. Very clean and refreshing. I want some now.... Mmmmmmm I will be visiting this place often. Thanks for recomending Bernice!"}
{"text":"Seated quickly, order handled efficiently. Staff brisk but moving many people through! Would eat here again! Pot stickers homemade and grilled to perfection."}
{"text":"IMO the best sushi you will find in the West Valley. Maybe you can find a larger selection of rolls in the other side of the city but its way better than the 2 sushi restaurants in Goodyear on Estrella Parkway/Pebble.  Spicy tuna is always super fresh, the Scorpion roll and Dynamite roll are great as well. Tasty miso soup. Love the salad dressing. Fantastic service and affordable lunch specials.  Been there apprx 7 times and its always consistent."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE FOR SUSHI. BECAUSE IT IS CHEAP AND NOT THAT GOOD. It is good for its price. The atmosphere is nice for group outings and the food always comes fairly quickly. We love coming here after work and we come during their happy hour which is fan-tas-tic."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the Goodyear area! They have delicious sushi at awesome prices. I highly recommend the Dynamite Roll and I also love the sweet potato roll. I tend to call ahead and let them know I'm on my way because they always seem to be busy (but I've never had to wait there more than 5-10 minutes). Definitely stop in and try this place, because it is awesome!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Sushi is great. Service is great. Best place so far. Love the crazy roll!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials!  Love the pink lady and the jalapeno rolls.  Nice little sushi place close to home."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Food is delicious, staff is friendly and happy hour is just short of all the time."}
{"text":"My husband finally talked me into going into this place. Every time we pass by, it's super busy. Packed with a line out the door (we always pass by on weekends). I've gotta say, I'm extremely glad I finally gave in. The workers we got to interact with were all very kind. The place is small - has a \"family owned\" vibe going on, which is nice.  The food was good and they have great prices! And they gave us a cute little half orange for free as a \"dessert\".  We'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We stopped in this past Sunday for a late lunch after a day of shopping. Service was bar none! Kevin was very attentive, thank you! The sushi was amazing & fresh, highly recommend the crazy roll if you like it spicy. Also had the pork katsu bento box. Very tasty, and the Gyoza reminded me of my childhood in Taiwan. Totally recommend this place if you're in Goodyear!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years.the happy hour deals are unbeatable. The service is almost always great, unless they're training a new person, because they've had their share of waitress drop outs. But the constant team is fabulous."}
{"text":"My husband has been going here for years and he finally told me about it. When I tried it, he wasn't kidding that it was one of the best sushi spots. On top of that, they have happy hour all day, every day. They also have fresh authentic wasabi that is not powdered or in tubes."}
{"text":"I really like this place, good environment, authentic tasty food, quality service. Fair prices in my opinion too."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Usually great service. My husband and I got our selves I trouble by getting a to go menu....we can now eat from the comfort of our own home! To go food is always fresh and amazing and made very quickly."}
{"text":"Found this Sushi & Grill restaurant on Yelp! The atmosphere is good, not to loud, small and welcoming. The fried Calamari was okay...but the miso soup and fresh GREEN side salad with house dressing was amazing!!! The Chicken Noodle Udon was great loved every bite.  Also ordered a few rolls of sushi, which was really fresh and delicious! The service was good as well!"}
{"text":"My favorite joint for sushi. Extensive sushi menu with something for everyone. They have a live sushi bar that you can sit at and watch them work. The restaurant is very clean and comfortable. I place a take out order a few times a month. But I also enjoy sitting in for lunch."}
{"text":"I only actually eat in the restaurant about 50% of the time, not that I have anything against it, its so close to my house I like to get take out and eat it at home.  Most of their staff has been there as long as I've been going there and are friendly and ready to serve.  For the value prices their food is very good with excellent service."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi great price. Yuki is awesome, she's extremely attentive and always on top of her game! The wally roll and ninja jalapeño is our absolute favorite... highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great rolls and good prices. Super friendly staff and pretty fast service."}
{"text":"The ahi tuna was delicious and very fresh. With that being said, we have never waited so long for sushi and it was very mediocre. Service was horrible. We didn't receive our appetizer until we were almost finished with our sushi rolls and our server brought us the wrong roll. Had to ask to refill for each of our waters twice. Not worth the trouble for mediocre sushi, I'm sure there are much better places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Solid sushi.  Great prices - we are talking 2-4 dollars for most rolls and appetizers during happy hour.    The location seems to be wrong on here as well, it is actually on the other side of the road further south - next to the Garden Pizza inside the huge (mostly empty currently) shopping center thing.  Also, moist towelettes!"}
{"text":"Located in the Super Target shopping Center.  HUGE portions!!!!!  Love the Bento Box Lunch, which is like $8.25 and is a lot of food too. It includes: the selected entree, plus white rice, 3pc. Gyoza, California Rolls, Miso Soup, and Salad. It's really good too.  Good food, friendly & attentive service, clean restrooms, and good location.  Like someone else mentioned, I was not too crazy about the LOUD heavy metal music playing. I would had expected some softer Japanese music or soothing soundscapes, like you hear playing at spas. I felt like I was at a Night Club...oh well.  I would eat here again for sure! I LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, tasty, and clean. The size of their rolls and nigiri is generous - not teeny tiny like other places. Quick and friendly service. I think it's the best sushi you can get in Goodyear."}
{"text":"I have wanted to visit this place for ages, and wanted to even more after seeing it featured on Check Please Arizona earlier this year. This place is definitely not a secret anymore--we arrived a little after noon on a Friday, and it was full except for the sushi bar! Fortunately, a couple left right as we entered, and their table was immediately cleaned for us.  Service was good throughout our visit. My husband ordered the beef teriyaki bento box while I ordered the chicken. Our salads and miso soups were brought out immediately. Both were good, and I especially liked the salad dressing. Our entrees soon came out. This really is a great deal for lunch. Everything tasted good and fresh. I'd like to come here again."}
{"text":"We tried this place because it's close to our house.  We liked their food and some of the servers are not great but most of them are nice.  We even stopped going to our regular spot but last Friday we stopped by after work and everything was fine until 3 of the servers sat on the table right next to us and started cleaning the menus with a cleaning solution that smelled horrible.  That ruined our food. I understand they need to keep the menus clean but they should do it in the back or in a space that it has no customers close or right next to them.  Now I rather drive to the other place and really enjoy my food"}
{"text":"The best Happy Hour in the West Valley!! The food and service is excellent! We love the rolls, and miso soup. Tried other items on the menu all were very good. We go often seems to be the best sushi on the west side. Love the complementary oranges after the meal, nice touch to a good meal"}
{"text":"Tasty Japanese option with quick service  Originally mixed this restaurant up with the Ah-So Sushi down the street and across the highway.  But, after eying it and always seeing it busy, my wife and I decided to stop in for dinner with our baby girl.  Service crew was quick to seat us, took our orders and brought us drinks, and were attentive throughout.    The sushi was good-- our 1 year-old simply LOVED the cucumber sushi-- though the gyoza has very little to no meat.  Edamame is lightly salted and comes warm.  Wakame is excellent.  And the main orders of combination udon hit the spot with a god mix of meats and vegetables with a nice, flavorful broth.  Very fair pricing and just a tad away from four stars.  I'll visit gain in the future to see if I should correct upward."}
{"text":"Awesome local Sushi place !!! Great date night fun ! Great prices... Great atmosphere !!! You must have a yellowtail jalapeño appetizer !!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour,  love the dynamite! Recommend it for a day after the pool! Refreshing and tasty!"}
{"text":"Not the worst sushi I've ever had but also not the best. The happy hour was amazing and rather cheap which was fantastic. The service was a bit mediocre. Took 10 mins for us to be greeted at our table but once we were it wasn't bad considering how busy he place was."}
{"text":"We've always had great service and the food is fantastic. I'm so glad they are close to my house and work. SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! West side needed a great place like this! Yuki rocks! Weve been coming hear for a few years. Will definitely continue"}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Customer service is always iffy but when it is busy, forget it and walk away.  Went when it was busy one time, we were seated next to another two people and our tables were together.  It was very awkward.  The service is also extremely terrible during busy times.  The sushi is excellent and their lunch specials are great!  Would recommend going at a odd time when they are not busy but still expect just mediocre service."}
{"text":"What a serendipity!! This place has all the other sushi places in the West Valley beat by far! Even my beloved Blu, since the prices during Happy Hour were incredible, the rolls were phenomenal, and the service was fantastic! Mark and I ordered the squid salad (fresh and not too salty), the Philly roll (standard, but good), and the Volcano roll--(delicious, flashing light and all!) We toasted with a sake bomb, since there aren't any cocktail options besides beer and sake. When the meal ended, our waitress brought us sweet, complimentary orange slices.   My only suggestions for the owners would be: turn up the music a tad, so I don't have to listen to the obnoxious gossipers at the table near by, and throw a few mirrors up on your almost-empty walls...they'll make the place feel bigger."}
{"text":"Love this place. All the fish is fresh. Service is above par with the waiters always knowledgeable. Happy is truly a bargain. Lots of food low price. It's a win win."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great happy hour prices. I love the Snow White roll which comes with crunchies on top and drizzled with eel sauce. The pikachu roll is awesome made with bananas, trust me it's a great roll!"}
{"text":"The first bad sign was when we asked the sushi chef if they use imitation crab or real crab. He didn't know. Seems like that's one you should know.  They won't be slicing off the tender most flavorful parts of the fish for you because all the fish is pre-portioned just waiting for an eager sushi 'chef' to roll up some barely edible roll or sushi.   Spare yourself and skip this restaurant."}
{"text":"We really love this place for sushi.....super fresh and excellent quality. The happy hour prices are amazing.   Don't pass this place up.....Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Won't go anywhere else for sushi! Now that I moved to the east valley I will constantly long for this delicious food AND will still go here for sushi. Staff are very attentive and always friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing food and outstanding service always a great pic for date night! The service has gotten a lot better and we always enjoy ourselves"}
{"text":"Very good service, sushi was made really fast, food was decent. Prices was very good too. We ordered 5 rolls and our bill only came out to $41"}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had! Our favorites are Pikachu Roll, Yuki Roll, Avocado Salad and the Negimaki appetizer!!!"}
{"text":"Ah Hai has become our go-to sushi place since we moved to Goodyear last year. Always fresh and delicious! Reasonable prices compared to other places. Great for dine in and take out!"}
{"text":"The size of the rolls are tiny! The service is at least good and the bright side, the dragon roll and tuna roll I ordered were at least very fresh and delicious compared to some places that make giant rolls and are tasteless. I'm really trying to think quality over quantity, but I'm also paying for it."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the west valley, and i go to visit my parents often on the west side--my mom and i love to come here after a little shopping.  First off the service is very good, our server was so attentive and nice.   Spicy Kani Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll were so good!  And of course--a Sapporo to go with it:)    And after your done eating, they bring a complimentary dessert of a fancy cut orange bowl with wedges pre-diced to pick with tooth picks, such a nice topping to a great lunch and pallet cleansing as well:)"}
{"text":"Javier and I went here on Saturday night. The good thing about this place is happy hour starts at 4pm and ends when the place closes. Good thing for you beer drinkers, they are super cheap. We shared all of our food that night. We started off with the ninja roll, this consists of crab and spicy tuna stuffed into a jalapeno topped with some eel sauce. This was our favorite!!!! We also had the pink lady and the scorpion. I love the inventive names of the rolls and the pink lady also had pink soy paper. Pink Lady, cucumber, avocado,Spicy crab, & Crunch Wrapped in soypaper w/ eel sauce & Spicy Mayo and Scorpion Roll, Shrimp tempura & cream cheese topped w/ kani, masago, eel sauce, & spicy mayo. We then shared the chicken hibachi meal for 10.99, consists of rice chicken and veggies and miso soup. This was horrible. there was too much sauce drenched on chicken and veggies. The miso soup made me want to gag. Rice was nothing special, just white rice also came with an orange that was tart. The four stars is based on the sushi here. DO NOT EAT THE REGULAR FOOD .  But sushi is terrific"}
{"text":"I am always afraid to try out new Sushi restaurants, but thanks to a recommendation from a friend and some good Yelp reviews I decided to give Ah Hai a try. My son and I are the only ones in our family who like sushi so I persuaded him to come to lunch with me today since I had a Val-Pak coupon for 50% off a second lunch bento box.  I really enjoyed the miso and salad that started off our meal. My only suggestion is maybe to order the dressing on the side since there was a pretty fair amount on there even though it was delicious. The bento lunch itself was pretty large and everything tasted very good and the California rolls tasted very fresh. In fact I can't wait to go back and try some of the rolls. They have a great happy hour as well and since this place is right around the corner from my house I am sure I will be back to give it a try."}
{"text":"Ah Hai is my go to sushi place! The prices are affordable, the service is quick and the sushi is delicious. I usually get to go orders and it's always ready on time and the order has always been correct. I have dined in a few times and the experience is just as good! The servers are friendly and quick. I have never left here feeling disappointed. They also have a great happy hour which is usually the time I always go at. I will definitely keep coming back here and letting people know about this great spot!"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR. Salmon Nigiri and the volcano roll were outstanding. We went back two nights in a row for these great deals. Regularly prices entrees were reasonable as well although unnecessary when there is such an extensive happy hour menu to choose from"}
{"text":"OPEN for business!!  It's located in the Canyon Trails Towne Center along the main entrance with the 2 banks.    Casual, cheap, yet decent quality sushi and Japanese entrees.  New and clean.  Excellent service.  Grand Opening special:  one FREE appetizer if you spend more than $10.    Decent spicy salmon and salmon avocado rolls.  Very crunchy shrimp tempura.  Excellent dressing with the included salad.  Miso soup was a bit bland.  They need to add a little more miso to the broth.  Lunch specials include any bento boxe for $8.25 and pick 2 rolls for $7.45 that includes miso soup and salad.  Hmmm, I'm not quite sure whether it's Ah-Kai Sushi & Grill or Ah-Hai Sushi & Grill.  Public records show Ah-Kai but the menu says Ah-Hai."}
{"text":"Love happy hour and their cheap sushi menu! Sushi was great and tasty. Worth it. Dynamite roll and rainbow roll are my favorites"}
{"text":"Was coming through Goodyear on the long drive home from San Diego and needed dinner/cater to a sushi craving. Ah Hai came up on yelp as the closest location while driving so we went for it. I always get nervous about trying new sushi places especially in unfamiliar territory.   Ah Hai did not disappoint when it came to the food!  Place was packed so we bellied up to the sushi bar. Service was a little slow and there was a language barrier between us and all/most of the staff.  But that didn't take away from the fabulous sushi rolls and fresh fish!"}
{"text":"Love the sushi! It's fresh, delicious and cheap. Don't expect much in atmosphere, but the help is friendly and efficient. Can't beat happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Great Sushi place off of the 303. The restaurant is small and clean. The service is fast and friendly and the food is really good. In addition the happy hour specials are awesome. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is I ordered a few simple rolls and was not blown away. I will be coming back and trying a few different rolls with the expectation that I will be changing my review to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, since it has such good reviews and nice happy hour prices...but I just didn't.   The decor is rather lacking and the booths were uncomfortable. The service was decent, not great.   We ordered Gyoza, which was ok. It's pan fried instead of deep fried, so it's not very crunchy. We also ordered a volcano roll and a rainbow roll, the rainbow roll wasn't that good, the shrimp on it was chewy and the avocado tasted a bit old. They brought us a thunder roll instead of a volcano roll. I'd been debating between the two so I thought I'd ordered the wrong thing and didn't make an issue of it, but when we got the receipt it said we had, in fact, ordered the volcano roll. The thunder roll was, again, just ok. The Tea and Miso soup were good.   All in all we just weren't impressed and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi, especially for the price.  Habachi chicken and veggies great too. Service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Always good food. Service can be kind of sub par at times, but we do go often. The sushi rolls are always very good. Not crazy about whatever they use for their tempura on the fried rolls."}
{"text":"Had sushi here based on the recommendations of some ladies at \"Out West\" feed store. They said it was great food and reasonable prices!  I agree. It was around $30 for two people. The sushi was yummy, the staff was friendly and attentive, we will be back!"}
