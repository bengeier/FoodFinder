{"text":"Upscale little pizza joint, Hanna was great we enjoyed her attention and service. The fig pie with arugula salad was great."}
{"text":"Took the family for happy hour today. There is so much awesome stuff on their happy hour!! We tried the house bread, shisheto peppers, and soup of the day. All of it was delicious, we also had the vegan pizza. The waiter was the sweetest guy! He was attentive and knew the menu well. I loved how many vegan options they have. I will for sure come back!

I had delicious wine on happy hour, and the bf had some great craft beer on tap."}
{"text":"Pizza was average and really skimpy on toppings. Only one red wine was available for happy hour..Service needs to improve.."}
{"text":"This place replaced Classic Italian Pizza, which was pretty solid.  While the place maintains its former charm I think they need some help on a few fronts.  

First, it took a while to get a seat and noticed their back couple of four tops were taken up with what seemed salad stations and prep areas (or maybe a large party from earlier)--either way I was surprised when we were seated at an awkward three top right by the door..awkward seating for sure.  We noticed a few people had to wait a while before someone decided to wait on them.  No table settings until requested.  

Appetizer was a caprese--mealy cheese and served on a wooden board...very wilted basil and very little, if any olive oil and balsamic drizzle.  When we asked for more balsamic we were given a container of watery vinaigrette.  

The pizza while it LOOKED great was burned on the bottom to the point of being inedible due to overpowering taste of wood ash.  After knowing what this pizza is supposed to taste like it was quite disappointing--the cook needs to check on the cleanliness of where they are putting the pizza (not dangerous, just not very tasty to eat ash on the bottom of your pizza).  The pizza was served on a kind of wooden board, kinda gross with no paper between the board and the food, being used at a place that serves seafood makes me cringe.

Wait staff were nice enough but would be nice to get one person that waited on your table, not a team--its annoying and felt like they were frazzled and disorganized. 

Beer selection is still solid and that is the reason for one star, the other is for hoping they get their act together as this place has massive potential....

I say give the place a chance and hopefully this review gets read and informal advice by a paying customer gets listened to."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have eaten here.  The first time I got pizzas to go and they were excellent.  This time the pizzas were burned and the ingredients were sparse and unevenly spread on the pizza so that some pieces were just bread and sauce.  

Our server left after taking the order and we were suppose to be \"handed off\" to another server.  It never happened.  We received our food but we were never checked on.  We had to flag someone down for a drink refill and to get the check."}
{"text":"Super fun cool vibe great food. We came for happy hour and will definitely come back! So excited to have a new spot :) !"}
{"text":"So excited we now have a great pizza joint in our neighborhood! Have now been twice; both times the food and service were fantastic!!"}
{"text":"My sister and I stopped by Sacred Pi with the pup around 4:30 on a Sunday afternoon; totally sold on their DAILY happy hour of 3:14-6pm. We sat out on the patio, which was deserted because we were the only ones nuts enough to sit out there on a triple-digit day. Ah, the things we do for the company of this crazy dog. 

We were greeted with waters immediately (even a big ole bowl for our big ole dog), and our server was super attentive and friendly throughout our entire visit. We dove right into the happy hour menu, of course, and got a pizza and dessert too. For two tiny ladies, we can put food away pretty damn well.

We each opted for the Lumberyard Heffeweisen, $4 on HH, and it was a solid choice and a great pairing for pizza. We also had two orders of the HH caprese ($1 each) and the chorizo meatballs ($5). The caprese was fine, but the mozzarella a little on the tough side. The balsamic glaze it was served with was excellent. The chorizo meatballs were awesome, unlike any other meatball I've had before; be warned though, these are spicy lil nuggets! 

We also ordered the small charcuterie board ($9), which was pretty underwhelming. It was a really solid manchego, super flavorful without being too harsh, and I'm always a sucker for marcona almonds. The fig jam that was served was also superb. This also came with some olive oil, arugula, mustard, balsamic glaze, and chorizo. No bread or crackers of any kind, which we thought was pretty strange. Maybe most people pay the buck extra for the bread on the HH menu? 

For our pizza, we opted for the garlic and basil. It was strange. Not bad necessarily, just not at all what we were expecting. The thin crust was SUPER thin, like barely even a crust... more of a cracker with some melty cheese and toppings. Also, you've gotta REALLY love garlic to get on board with this one. I adore garlic, I use it in probably 80% of what I cook, but we're talkin' like half cloves squirreled away so that your entire mouth becomes garlic-bombed every three bites. A very strange experience. Though the basil seemed really fresh, I probably wouldn't opt for this one again. 

The beeramisu was also fine. It was a perfectly well-made tiramisu, just didn't taste quite as much like beer as the menu made it seem. 

I don't see us returning here any time soon, or at least not for pizza. Might revisit in late fall when the weather's nice again and the pup has proven himself a goodboi and deserving of an outing. Probably HH apps only, though."}
{"text":"Would have maybe gotten 4 stars if the pizza was hot or warm even, they told me 30-35 minutes so that's when i came, pizza boxes were cold the pizza sat a while. I think it's probably pretty good if I go back I'd try to eat there. Not to go..."}
{"text":"We stumbled into Sacred Pi after running an errand in a business near by. We were pleasantly surprised after we had finished. The arugula salad is so fresh and perfectly simple. The bread, olive oil, pesto were so delicious as well. The reason this is getting 4 stars is because I wish they offered a vegan cheese. And no not something like daiya but possibly a high quality nut cheese similar to what LGO uses. Our bartender was also very friendly. We have had the same nice guy twice. He is always helpful, attentive, and has great manners."}
{"text":"So sad to say \"Sacred Pi\" didn't leave me inspired, but sick and disappointed. The peppers were plain, no cheese, no frill. Pizza dough was chalky but light. And the sparse toppings left me looking for what stuff was actually ON the $16 no tastings \"12 pizza. This place is overrated. Suggest you better eat at Nello's or something more on point with flavor."}
{"text":"This pizza place is the BEST!! Fast and friendly service. The crust is crispy and chewy and DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Sacred Pi  just introduced sandwiches on the menu.  My friend and I split two sandwiches so we could both try them.  Both sandwiches were not on sliced bread, but in a house made artisan thin round bread in the shape of a half circle.  The bread texture was hearty and felt like it was made from whole grains although I didn't confirm.  It was lighter in it quantity, but I enjoyed the artisan sourdough flavor.

1. Iberico meatball - This sandwich was my preference between the two we tried.  Iberico cheese (aka semi-curado in Spain) is my favourite cheese of all time.  It is a lighter version of the stronger flavored manchego cheese which is more famous.   Iberico cheeses are rarely served melted as it is on this sandwich.  In my opinion when Iberico melts it much of its nuance is lost and seems like the ubiquitous mozzarella, but I like mozzarella too.  The meatballs also have an herb which set it apart as an exclusive experience.  This sandwich overall seemed more filling than the buffalo chicken

2. Buffalo Chicken - The term buffalo which pretty much means Frank's hot sauce in my mind, might be on this sandwich , but it does not dominate the pallet when eating this.   I was expecting more boldness or spiciness from this sandwich.  I did like the lettuces on the sandwich and the lime misted arugula salad was great since I feel like I can never get enough greens."}
{"text":"This has swiftly become my favorite pizza spot when I want a high quality pie and some fantastic wines. The ingredients are top notch across the board, so order without worry. 

Favorite Appetizer - Iberico chorizo meatballs with Parmigiano, an intense red sauce, and served with fresh baked bread.  

Favorite salad - Arugula - Simple salad, but the dressing is nothing short of amazing! The lemon compliments the pepper perfectly, plus you can never go wrong with more fresh parmigiano reggiano and almonds. 


Favorite Pizza - this has no good answer, as we build our own each time, but the one truth is that I'm sure you can't go wrong due to the fresh meats, cheese, and gravy options. I personally like it simple; Red gravy, salami, topped with ricotta. 

If you're in the area you must check Sacred out, but try not to tell too many friends.. I'd like to keep this hidden gem; hidden."}
{"text":"Great staff and you know that matters. Fun ambiance-great for a strip mall. The pizza was delish! I live the sauce, crusts made fresh daily, mozzarella hand pulled in house. Wood fired!! Great local beer on tap (sacred). Nice wine detection. Can't go wrong. Promise."}
{"text":"My friend described it best when he said it was good but not memorable. The salad was meh... the fig jam on our pizza was too sweet and the beer was good. Service was okay, not bad but not outstanding. The decor was my favorite part. Give me chalkboard paint and an industrial vibe and I'm happy to be there. Overall though, nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"The food deserves five stars. But the service wasn't so great so take away one star. The autumn salad was really good. I also had the sausage pizza it was really spicy and delicious. The beer selection and the wine selection is awesome."}
{"text":"Happy hour bites were spot on! We tried the caprese, meatballs, meat and cheese board, shishito peppers, and a salad. Quality of ingredients was amazing. The beermisu was a delicious rendition of tiramisu made with a local beer. 

For all the beer heads and dessert peeps go there get the beermisu you won't be disappointed. 

Service was also top notch. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Perfect for a date. They have one of the best patios I have seen in Arizona. Support this place! Great food, drinks, and service. Just far enough outside of Tempe to circumvent the usual Tempe crowds."}
{"text":"Loved the Zen vibe of the place.  Our waiter was attentive and the menu was very creative!  It was really difficult to decide, but we both ended up ordering pizza.  The ingredients are high quality and the pizza was delicious.  Just not enough filling.  Hence 4 rather than 5 stars.

I would say on average, there was a 2\" border of crust all around (on a 10\" pie), and a very THIN amount of 6 inch wide filling in the center.  The gluten-free crust was excellent BTW.  Of the overhead pictures of pizza on this page, the very last pic is true to what we were served.  The other pics are misleading.  I don't mind paying a higher price for a better quality and well thought-out \"Pi\" but I DO expect a better representation of same.  I'll probably go back, (the home-made sodas are out of this world!), but I'll order something other than pizza to see whether the other offerings are as sparse.  Hopefully not."}
{"text":"The wood-fire pizza was amazing, nice live music and a really nice laid back vibe. Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  It's like a piece of Italy in the middle of the desert!  The dough and ingredients are incredible...we actually buy directly from the chef for our pizza oven at home and our friends love it.  The cocktails are all fresh and some of the best in the area. 
 Definately worth trying out if your in the mood for great pizza, wine or cocktails."}
{"text":"We liked it! Everything was fresh - we ordered the arugula salad which fresh, simple & flavorful. Also had a pizza & the crust was excellent & the cheese was a highlight. We loved the Malbec we ordered which was made from organic grapes & a 92 points rated wine for only $29 a bottle! We loved the atmosphere which was romantic and earthy. Chocolates were to die for. We'll definitely be back for happy hour! And to try their \"beermasu\""}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a whim... SO glad I did. Delicious pizza. Got the \"Hatch chile\" pizza and was not disappointed. They use a wood burning pizza oven which gives the crust a great char. The hatch chile had a kick, but didn't destroy my tastebuds. Very friendly staff, who were quick to answer my random questions and made my visit better than your average \"pizza joint\"  10/10"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places to eat! The drinks are great and we love the retro tv shows. The best part, though is the food. The meatballs are amazing (I often stop by just to get them to go) and the Italian meat pizza may be my favorite pizza anywhere. The combination of Sacred Pi, Changing Hands, Inner Vision Yoga, and Trader Joe's makes this whole corner a worthy destination!"}
{"text":"Ask some mathematicians and they'd say pi is sacred. Ask some foodies and they'd agree. Ask me on March 14th and I'll tell you I am having a serious pi craving!  

At Sacred Pi the doors open and happy hour starts at 3:14pm each day. The dough is mixed by hand daily in-house and they pull their own mozzarella cheese, too. Add-in a dog friendly patio, eclectic drink & signature cocktail menu, and indie music for a background soundtrack to create a hipster dining experience that, in my opinion, rivals local favorites like Cornish Pasty Co. and Postino. 

Sacred Pi has turned me into a beer-liever -- OMG the Beerimsu! It is not always available but make sure to get a slice (or two) if it is. Each visit we've been helped by Erick, who was very polite but probably could use some more help when the restaurant is busy. Pacing of our meals suffered slightly due to the one person wait-staff. 

A solid 3.14159265359...stars for Sacred Pi, rounded up to 4 for good measure and because combining math puns and pizza is cool! 

Happy Pi Day, Sacred Pi!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Friday night for a late dinner after a long day at work. The place was still pretty full for 9 p.m., but we were seated promptly. 
The menu is pretty typical of what you would expect at a woodfired pizza place. The beer list is pretty solid with some great local and other craft beer options. We started with the large arugula salad. The dressing was on the heavy side, but it was still pretty good. 
My husband and I also split the capricciosa pizza. We opted to switch out the ham for proscuitto. Overall, it was a pretty good pizza. The crust was warm and just the right balance between doughy and crisp (as a woodfired pizza should be). The toppings were... interesting. The pepperoncini and artichokes seemed a bit out of place in contrast to the rest of the toppings. That certainly doesn't mean it wasn't good, just different. 
Our server was very friendly and attentive. Overall, Sacred Pi doesn't really compare to some of the more notable woodfired pizza places (i.e. Pizzicletta in Flagstaff or Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix). It is a good choice if you're in the Tempe area. We'll definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"A surprise change in ownership......stopped in for lunch Sat. Waitress recommended  the pizza w / Parm sauce; a good call ! My wife & I both had salads.....the house vinegarette was a little smokey for my taste ( not the usual , which is kind of expected in a house dressing )......time will tell"}
{"text":"The story starts at Mac's.

Mac's is the sad pub next door to Sacred Pi.

I'm always on the look out for cute bars, not too far from my my house, that has good food, and good service.

Well, who doesn't want all that, to be honest.

Anyway, Mac's now sucks, but I couldn't figure out why, so I was there trying to figure out why, and serendipitously, I met Svein, the bartender from Sacred Pi.

I got to chatting with Svein, who previously worked for Sam Fox, and after meeting with him, I couldn't wait to try Sacred Pi.

SACRED PI

Sacred Pi is the brainchild of Mike Barro, the son of the juggernaut Barro's Pizza, on the southwest corner of McClintock and Guadalupe, in Tempe, Arizona.

After growing up enveloped in his families local business, Barro's Pizza, Mike ventured to San Francisco to learn all there is to know from pizza expert, Tony G at the International School of Pizza. 

Years later, Mike decided to put his expertise to use... and thus, Sacred Pi was born.

Everything at Sacred Pi is cooked in their 100% wood-burning brick oven. They make their dough fresh, by hand, everyday. They pull their mozzarella cheese fresh, by hand, everyday. They take pride in their local, fresh, and organic ingredients. 

Gluten-Free, Vegetarian, and Vegan options available and delicious.

THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE

I popped in this week. 

I walked in and was delightfully surprised.

Immediately, I saw all of the great things that make a restaurant fun and cool.

There was a cute and fun hostess, a super cute atmosphere with hippie chic décor, and groovy music.

The place was packed, Svein was behind the bar, and Mike was in the kitchen.

I sat at the bar and I was already happy, I just had to try the food.

I couldn't wait to try their photo worthy beeramisu, so that's what I ordered first. Omgaaaah SCRUMMY!! I wish it wasn't that good, because I'm totally hooked.

I tried the meatball sub, with spicy fresh meatballs, fresh mozzarella cheese, and fresh scratch made bread. The meatballs were good, the sub was a tad bread-y.

I ended with the Cannolis, which were good, but not great; the filling was a bit bland and it was a bit too crunchy.

Whilst sitting at the bar, a who's who of Tempe filtered in. I had a chance to chat with them, as well as long time Mac's regulars too. It looks like Mac's is officially out, and Sacred Pi is in.

I was so impressed with the place, I asked Svein, if he could have the perfect Yelp review, what would he want in it. He said, \"great service, great fresh food, and a great selection of wines and brews.\" All of which, I totally agree.

My only complaint is that when I went to write the review, I saw Mike Barro had taken a bunch of liberties with my copyrighted and metadata encrypted photos to promote his business on all of his social media platforms, including his business and personal IG, and FB, without giving photo credits nor asking permission.

Tisk Tisk Mike. I don't steal your food, don't steal my intellectual property.

CONCLUSION 

Sacred Pi is fun, cute, and delicious. 

4/5 RECOMMEND

{"text":"Enjoyed ambience and food was tasty . We attended for birthday celebration and they were out of their primary desert and only had one option left . No celebratory desert for birthday available . 
Would return to this restaurant but not for a birthday ."}
{"text":"We had a delightful dinner last night. First the staff were friendly and warm. Could not have enjoyed our service more. Now the food....amazing! We shared a pizza, gnocchi and wood fired bread. Everything was spot on. The pizza was amazing...the perfect blend of creamy from the mozzarella cheese and the saltiness from the Italian meats. The pizza crust was thin with a nice chewy crisp. We ordered traditional pepperoni and sausage  but next time we will venture into pizza combinations. Lots of different pizza options. The fall gnocchi is made from sweet potatoes and very unique. Great selection of wine and beer with what looks to be a full bar. Love that the beers on tap are all local. We live in the neighborhood and will make this place one of our new favorites."}
{"text":"Tasty and interesting happy hour offerings at a good value - including drink options. Pizza was made with fresh ingredients. We had the spinach pizza, and the crust was amazing!  I typically don't eat the crust. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried out beings it's in our hood. Ambience was nice. Ordered pizza, it was good, not great. Arugula salad was really good. We ordered wine (like we always do) and immediately noticed the pour was below the average size of normal pour. We inquired about it and the waitress told us they are all measured to 5oz. We happened to notice the bartender definitely does not measure wine pores. The waitress was not very friendly, never smiled, never asked us how we were, not personable."}
{"text":"If you like homemade dough and fresh, local ingredients, this place is for you! Also decent selection of beer and wine.

Wife and I had a meat and cheese board which was fantastic. We also had a Greek gluten free pizza which was amazing! It was a white pizza with lots of flavor a bit of a kick. Dough was similar to Cibo's. But we both thought the pizza here was better."}
{"text":"Tasty food and good wine and beer selection.  We had the bread appetizer, Greek Salad with chicken, and the Autumn Gnocchi.  All very good.  The service could be a trifle faster, but we weren't in a hurry and it was a relaxed atmosphere.   Great music on the patio!  It's a repeater."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed everything. My husband and I got a meat pizza and the sacred salad and it was so good. Our server was Mikala and she was so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"What a great find this was. We started next door waiting 15 minutes for a menu and beers and just walked out. We were greeted immediately when we walked into Sacred Pi. The meatball appetizer was clever and tasty, the pizza was just like we like it, thin crust and fresh toppings. Server treated us like friends. Suggested a drink for my wife and a wine pairing for me. I feel bad I forgot his name. 

We are Sacred Pi fans."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I ordered a pizza for take out yesterday. Though the flavor was amazing, when you picked up a piece of pizza, all the toppings about fell off. The crust was the only thing that maintained it's composure, as the rest of the pizza slice just drooped down at almost a 90 degree angle. Disappointing, as there would be no way I'd spend another $15 on a 10\" pizza here again. The pictures on the website are far more enticing than what we received yesterday."}
{"text":"The pizza and atmosphere here are great. Bonus points for a good selection of Pedal Haus beers. I've tried a few of a pizzas, including the vegan option, and they've all been delicious."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Love their pizza. The dough is out of this world. Great wine selection! Great prices!! You have to check it out! Pizza and bottle of great wine for $25!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.  One star because the beer selection was decent.  Needs improvement on the wine selection.  Ordered two pizzas and both came out with skimpy toppings, soggy crust and lukewarm in temperature.  We will not be back!"}
{"text":"All hail the Sacred Pi, the glorification of 3.14159265359 in edible form! All those that are curious are free to visit the Church of Pi-entology (Previously Classic Italian Pizza). They offer their followers bread (In sandwich or pizza form) and wine (As well as Sacred Soda, beer, and cocktails), a spiritual sacrament for communion with the one true mathematical constant.

(Cue Monty Python monks walking in a line, chanting)

 \"Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem\" 

(WHACK! sound of heads smacking against their hand-held pizza boxes)

The Sacred Pi welcomes all of various stomach size. They also welcome the four legged, for there is a small but lovely looking patio in front for dog-and-dines. This establishment seems to be the Sacred Haven for hipsters, but in general the Sacred Pi turns no one away from enjoying wood fired pizza with high quality ingredients.

We decided to get the Iberico meatball appetizer, and split the Italian sandwich and El Fuego pizza. The meatballs came on a wooden platter, with a side of flatbread. The meatballs weren't as tender as I've had at other restaurants but had a robust earthy flavor with the Iberico pork + chorizo and I loved the red sauce it came with. The flatbread was nice except for a piece that had too much char on it for me to eat. The sandwich was served in the same type of flatbread the meatballs were served with which was a bit of a surprise to me since it looked more like a pita than a traditional sandwich. The flavors were cool and crisp and the meat tasted good with the other ingredients and the bread. Our server warned us that El Fuego was muy caliente, but I said BRING ON THE HEAT! It had three types of peppers (Crushed red, Serrano and Calabrian), sausage, pepperoni, mozzarella, and the house tomato sauce. The flavor of the pizza was nice. I liked the balance of salinity from the meats with the creamy cheese, richly flavored tomato sauce and spicy pepper triple threat. It was pretty spicy, not the spiciest meal I've had but perhaps the spiciest pizza I've eaten in a while. 

The one thing that kept me from totally enjoying this meal was actually the crust. I like how they use the wood fired oven to make the pizzas and that they use imported Italian 00 flour but when we received our pizzas they were hard to actually hold and pick up. While the crust tasted good the slices I picked up were too limp to be able to pick up and eat without the fear of the ingredients sliding off the pizza. 

I was so full I couldn't have dessert but I do want to go back to try their intriguing Beermisu, made with Guinness and Irish Cream.

Overall this is a nice little spot for some casual eats with superb ingredients. I'll be back and maybe I'll bring the pups too! I'll have to stop by on the holiest of Sacred Pi days, 3/14 next year as well!"}
{"text":"I tend to withhold judgement on a new restaurant until they have worked out their kinks, but Sacred Pi is off to a good start just having their grand opening on 9/22. Nestled in the same plaza as Changing Hands and Trader Joes, this restaurant took over the spot of Classic Italian Pizza and as far as I have seen so far, it is a step up!   They focus on hand pulled mozzarella and house made sauces and offer pizzas, sandwiches and a range of appetizers and salads, in fact they even offer oysters, not a common site around town.  I had a carnivoro zarcone (~$12)(folded over dough crust with three meats, hand pulled mozzarella and sauce) that was very savory with a nice thin crust. It came with a choice of size salads: I opted for the autumn which strangely had strawberries, almonds and goat cheese which feels more springlike.  Will definitely be back, my only regret was that I did not see the specials, a lamb pizza and a hatch chili pizza until I was leaving."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. 

Get the bread, little nuggets from heaven 



Prosciutto fig pizza is a little sweet and unbelievable."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a delicious, hand-made gluten-free pizza in Tempe, this isn't it. It's only hand-made and in Tempe. The dough is super thick, chalky, salty and under cooked, with my minimal toppings. My daughter ordered pepperoni and there was maybe 4 pepperonis and almost no noticeable cheese. On the plus side, the patio is nice, and the wait staff was great, but the pizza was a big let-down for me. The caprese salad appetizer is just ok. The tomato was uninspired and unsalted. The Moscow mule is made with \"some kind of ginger sauce\" and club soda. They don't have ginger beer. Oh, and skip the cannoli desert. A cannoli is made with pistachio and mascarpone- not ricotta and dough. Terrible."}
{"text":"First of all this review has nothing to do with food quality, I'm sure their food is great. This review is solely based on service... 

Today we went to Sacred Pi because everyone in our training group wanted pizza and they had good reviews and were close. We arrived, asked that it was okay to move tables together, which they didn't have a problem with, and sat down. After a couple minutes someone brought water and menus to our table and said they waiter would be with us shortly. After waiting about 10 minutes, watching the waiter walk by us several times and help others who came in after us we got up and left. Had the waiter at least stopped by our table and said he'd be with us shortly or any sort of communication with us at all this might be acceptable, however we felt like we were being actively ignored."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. Had the honey mustard salad, prosciutto asparagus, and Margherita pizza. We Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Sacred Pi is good and has the potential to be great.  We stopped in late Saturday afternoon for an early dinner.  We started out with the meatball appetizer (which was supposed to be on the HH menu for $5 but we were charged full price).  It came with 3 meatballs.  They were a bit dry but the sauce was tasty.  We then each had a pizza.  We originally decided to come here as they had a gluten free dairy free pizza for my husband.  When we looked at the menu the dairy free pizza was gone. The waitress said they had just removed it from the menu.  She checked and they made it anyway.  It was probably the best gluten free crust he had ever had!  However, sauce and toppings were scarce.  And while my pizza was good, it too suffered from a lack of toppings.  The sauce, cheese, pepperoni and sausage were very sparse, but the crust was awesome.  For pizzas that cost $15 each we just expected more.  My husband had the gluten free light Lager and he said that too was the best he ever had.  I was too full for dessert, but he had one of their homemade chocolates ($2) which he liked.   The service was great, and we liked that everything was made in house or locally, they just need to beef up the toppings."}
{"text":"I'll admit it.... As I was walking up to sacred pi I was having second thoughts. I'm not in Tempe on the weekends often and want to make the most of eating in that part of town while I'm there (ridiculous but true). What sold me? They had 5$ off coupons in a chest outside their door we could use...it was fate! I was glad we went in because this place was seriously tasty. We split the meatball appetizer, which was a bit small for the price, but tasted good. I would suggest they serve it with a piece of bread or something to sop up the sauce and make it feel more like a complete appetizer worth 8$ instead of 3 smallish meatballs on a plate. We split their pizza with the prosciutto and fig or balsamic......whatever it was, it was sooooo good. The husband and I fought over the leftovers lol. I would highly recommend that pizza....one of the best of its kind around the valley. We also got the beerimisu....oh yes....maybe not as good as regular tiramisu (I love the coffee, you know), but fun and creative and tasty with a large portion size and appropriate price tag. I would definitely come back to this restaurant in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered the prosciutto fig pizza and it was delicious. It was the BEST gluten free pizza I have ever had. I'm very used to the thin crust gluten free but was pleasantly surprised at the thicker and airy dough! I do wish that there was a little more cheese on my pizza but nonetheless still good enough to come back!"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and found this place on YELP. Hidden GEM! Great food, great pizza and great service. Told our local family and friends to visit. Will be sure to visit when I'm in the area again."}
