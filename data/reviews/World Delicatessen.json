{"text":"A simple, cheap and tasty lunch awaits. I always order the sate shrimp and chicken and have never been disappointed with taste or quality. Love the crunch on their spring roll as well

Docking 1 star because the line gets quite long during the main lunch hour of 12-1"}
{"text":"Weird little cafeteria in the Calgary Tower that serves Sandwich-esque and Asian-esque food directly across the Auburn's indoor entrance. Had the Beef Sate Sub for $7.25. That's it! No surprise with the GST, very direct and clear on price ... nice!

It was a little confusing after my order where my sub was to be made. To the left of the register is the kitchen area where they make the sandwiches and deep fried stuff. To the right of the register is the designated sub creation area. It took a few minutes to understand their process. 

The order system was also kind of weird. Basically you wait to the side Starbucks style for your order and the dish gets called out. I found it a little strange that everyone waiting will know what I ordered. Despite the chaos of the process, they manage to do a lot of turnover during the lunch rush. 

One should note that most of the food here is pre-maid and/or frozen food fry and serve. However they also sell soups, salads and made-on-the-spot sandwiches. It isn't the most gourmet place for food. But is it quick and easy? You bet! Open 6 am to 4 pm M-F.

{"text":"I work down on 9th Ave SE and there's not a great deal of places to eat without having to put on a coat and leave the building. This place is withing the confines of the plus 15 system, just at the bottom of the Calgary Tower. 

I had seen people with what I thought was Vietnamese food and wondered where they got it from. Here's the place. I recently tried the lemongrass chicken which was decent but not lemony enough for me. The crispy roll it came with wasn't one of the best I've had but ok none the less. The shrimp salad rolls were pretty good, so was the peanut dipping sauce although it could be more peanutty.

One morning my stomach was growling so my colleague and I ventured over to World Delicatessen for some breakfast. I had an english muffin with egg, ham and cheese. I have to say it was way too salty. Not sure if I'll try breaky here again but certainly will have the Vietnamese again. They also have Viet subs which looked pretty good. Maybe that'll be next on my list."}
{"text":"Typically, like to have a light lunch so when I caught the whiff of Sate Chicken soup I figured I had to try it.  I don't know if I can say it was amazing but it was pretty good.  The chicken actually has some flavor instead of the type of soup that someone throws chicken into as an afterthought.  I had to add a little Sriracha sauce to give it some kick but overall its pretty good.  One small warning before you are on your way there to grab some...
1. This soup has a very strong (delicious) smell and it will encompass your entire office if you take it there to eat it.  It smells like Vietnamese soup. Some don't find the smell as appealing as I may."}
