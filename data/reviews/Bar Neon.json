{"text":"Sparkly decor. Cheery atmosphere. Delicious bourbon cocktails - Bourbon Negroni y'all! Yummy snacks - I had the mushroom Tosta. The people serving, bartending and cooking did so with a perfect balance of friendliness and care. The music was fantastic and loud enough to enjoy but not so loud to hinder conversation.   A perfect spot to warm up on an icy night. and enjoy the company of good friends   Plus - the toilet floors are paved with pennies!"}
{"text":"Not that I go out anymore (much) but if I did, this would be my new favourite place.  I decided to come here for my birthday, on a Saturday night.  I had invited around 15-20 people. I knew it was a smallish space, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I arrived at around 9:30 and there was already a large group at one table (Nooooo!).  The back patio, which is lovely, was empty, but it looked like rain so did not want to risk it.  My husband and I sat at a 4-top, and when the waitress came by, we explained our dilemma.  She was amazing, and offered to put together several tables for us, once another table was finished their meal.   I cannot stress how easy going and accommodating she was.    I don't know if it was a slow night, but it never got insanely packed in here like some reviewers experienced.  It was the perfect place my our little gathering.  They have a full bar, and lots of great beers on tap, including Beau's lug tread.  Nice murals on the walls, too.  Oh!  They also have lots of delicious tapas to go along with your alcohol consumption.   Highly recommend this place, a gem on the Bloor& Lansdowne strip."}
{"text":"Great staff--attentive, casual, engaging.  Awesome cocktails. I love blending the bourbon and amaretto sours, which come topped with the traditional egg white.  Their daily buck a shuck is great, but orders can take a while to make it from pad to plate.   ps. Love the collaged walls and their neon blinking last call sign."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour.  Buck a shuck oysters, $5 dollar beers, great patio, amazing staff.......this place is the shit.  I come at least once a week and I always have a good time.  Good atmosphere and music and just a chill place to have a drink after work. Love this place."}
{"text":"i'be been here twice for the happy hour. The oyster was very fresh. But they did count one more dozen of the oyster at every time we check out. They correct it after we pointed out. But just want to remind other guests..."}
{"text":"This place is cute and the hidden back patio is a gem. The kitchen is super tiny and honestly just plain filthy looking. Regardless of how awesome the menu may look, I would only recommend having drinks here."}
{"text":"I went to this bar with my significant other and we were not even noticed right away. I asked the bar tender (female) for her favorite drink. I expected to get a normal portion but when I received my bill of 24$ for two drinks I was told her recommendation was a double pour. That is one of the most scum bag tactics I have ever seen a bar tender do. Do not go here unless you want to be ripped off on reccomended drinks that aren't even good..."}
{"text":"Love the buck-a-shuck oyster happy hour!  Nice chill vibe, with a patio in the warmer season.  The food is pretty relaxed fare, but never disappoints - great for after work or evening drinks with friends.  And my husband and I do our date nights here every once in a while when we feel like something low-key and in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"'Lack of authenticity'  An unimaginative beachhead of white gentrification in an otherwise diverse Toronto neighbourhood. Bar Neon offers a crew of white servers, serving up mediocre food in one of Toronto's last creative peripheries. I went in and was disappointed by the beer selection but excited by the food. It's your classic millstreet menu and the same series of cocktails you find everywhere with zero imagination.  Dark and stormy anyone? I had the cider. Good. I had the burger with salad. A bit of a rip off. 17.50 for under ripened lettuce and a burger that was nicely coloured inside but completely singed on the outside. It came complete with that delectable burnt flavour. No extra charge. I wasn't asked how anything was until the end and the burger was a mayo covered mess. The 'bun' seemed to have an identity crisis, unsure of what sort of bread it was trying to be (pita, yeastless catastrophe?). Anyway. Very disappointing food, drinks, and just not reflective of the neighbourhood whatsoever. The sort of place that is pandering instead of being. A complete lack of authenticity."}
{"text":"Cool place and casual.  Gets loud later in the evening and fills up.  Stick to the drinks and don't bother with the snacks..."}
{"text":"Dinner at the bar, Mar 14.  Loved the $1 oysters (5pm-7pm); had 18 by myself.  Would have had 18 more if I hadn't arrived at 6:45pm.  Loved the cocktail menu.  Had a bourbon sour and an old fashioned.  They burn the orange peel with a lighter to extract more oil.  Gotta try this at home.  Liked but quickly tired of the Greek tapas menu.  Had the spanakopita, pork souvlaki, bread and dips, and meatballs.  Tasted good but we got bored with this menu pretty fast and didn't feel like ordering anything else.  They said they will change menus in the spring so looking forward to that.  But I'll go back anytime between 5pm and 7pm for the dollar oysters and cocktails."}
{"text":"Bar Neon is a favourite amongst my friends for a place to grab a casual drink. I can't really speak to the food (I've only had the Greek tapas plate, albeit enjoyed it very much), but the cocktails are amazing - well prepared, generously poured, and with enough variety in terms of options to keep things interesting but not a mammoth, overwhelming list. The staff are very friendly and low-key. The 90's-weighted music selection is a fun throwback (assuming that you were growing up in the 90s :), and while others have pointed out that the bar is too crowded for dancing - which is true - I suppose it's never bothered me because when friends and I go to Bar Neon, it really is to sit back, have great drinks, and chat/hang out with other with a fun music backdrop. Also, bonus points for a great patio, when the weather's cooperating."}
{"text":"Really poor and almost non existent customer service. The bar tender basically ignored our group, did not out our order in and did not come by for an inordinately long time to clear our dishes and take a new drink order.  When we expressed the disservice to each other, one of the servers overheard and immediately got defensive and made patronizing remarks.  I really enjoyed the food but don't understand why it took 10 mins to get the zucchini fritters and then over 30 mins later, still waiting for the second order after we finished eating and drinking."}
{"text":"Great patio out back, nice tunes, friendly crowd.   My only discontent is the limited selection of Draft beers but hey, you don't always get what you want in life. They make up it with a very decent variety of bottles."}
{"text":"Buck a shuck Malpeques and $5 draft Beaus. On point. Nothing more needs to be said."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for dinner. Ordered some beers, the grilled calamari, 1 lb wings and a dozen oysters (buck a shuck). The food was decent and while the ingredients were fresh, the taste was nothing special. It was a little pricey for what they were, particularly the grilled calamari. The wings were good and the house made sauce was unique but out of the pound of wings, there was only one wing and the rest were drumsticks. It was a good place though to sit and have a drink, good atmosphere. Unfortunately service was a little less than attentive. Overall, I'd still come back if I were in the area but only for the drinks, dollar oysters and if the wings were half priced."}
{"text":"I came here after a daylong meeting with food enthusiasts at FoodShare, just down the road (check out their greenhouse and garden!) and two of the people from rural areas fell in love with the Bloor West scene. So that has to say something. The service is super; our server, Kelly, was our good buddy by the end of the night (and we did spend most of the night). Lots of local craft beer, which is nice to see in a restaurant -- a sign they support the local economy and young independent food artisans. The dips were Mediterranean, and were delicious. They must be trying this new thing-- called cooking from scratch with real ingredients. Around 9:00, the place got jam-packed, and I think I was the only person there without black pants and a black shirt.  As I say, my friends from countryside Ontario were thrilled by the ambience and friendliness. As I argue in my e-book Food for City Building, restaurants double as ambassadors for healthier fresher more local foods and for the city that nourishes them. This is a case study of that trend."}
{"text":"Bar Neon is an amazing happy hour joint. Oysters for $1 and $5 pints of Beaus. Even though the menu is limited, everything is great. Great clientele, and a beautiful back patio (where smoking is allowed A+++)."}
{"text":"Love their buck a shuck! Ends at 7. Gets busy. Remember to reserve a table. Good drinks and food."}
{"text":"I had avoided this place. It looked a bit broken down from the outside. I wondered if it would be another depressing, empty joint on the Bloordale strip. I was so wrong. The bar menu is absolutely fantastic. A delightful surprise. Light Greek tapas. Simple hearty dips, olives and breads. I ordered the hamburger and feta fries. Absolutely delicious. The best fries I've had in a long time. The melted feta cheese and acidity of what must have been a little vinegar made the fries stand out from what you expect to find at a bar. The burger was good.  The sangria I ordered was a delicate fusion of tart and sweet. It's a lovely spot to meet friends or have a date. The whole place is bathed in glowing candlelight.  Lessons learned:  -don't judge a book by its cover.  -Go back to Bar Neon"}
{"text":"Ahh... Bar Neon, all the wonderful things I could say. I've spent most of my summer days on their back patio taking advantage of their daily happy hour specials. Great drinks, oysters and Greek-Inspired tapas to which I've had almost everything on their menu and it's always a 10/10. A little heat and a lot of flavor. Very cool vibes for a night out with the girls, a \"hip\" place to bring your parents, a good first/second/third date or a great place to sit and read a book."}
{"text":"This place was ok, but not great. I don't really get the appeal.  We went last week for a friends birthday. The place was packed and she had invited quiet a few people.  By the luck of my bulging preggy tums, we managed to swindle a seat at a table. There was another couple wanting the table too and we had no problem sharing. I had expected, from the reviews, that we would be able to get some decent snacks at this place. But the table service was over (we weren't there very late, maybe 9 or 9:30) and since the place was so packed it was really hard to get drinks, not to mention a bite to eat. From the looks of the drinks consumed at my table, and reactions of my friends, the drinks were definitely good. And not just mixed from a lame fountain where the bartender just pushes a pre-dosed button. That's bonus points for sure. But the food was blah. I just had an order of feta fries and didn't even finish them. The music was good. Throwback to high school tunes for sure. But as another yelper mentioned, no room to dance anywhere if you tried.  I don't want to deduct points on this place because it was so crowded. Not their fault. Good for them actually. But it's just not my vibe. Atmosphere was lacking, not worth it for me to want to repeat this place.  From what I saw of the patio, it would probably be pretty sweet back there in better weather. Strange though that there was no music playing on the patio at all. Not even quietly. That alone would make it a temporary smoke spot, instead of an actual hang out for more drinks spot. Too desolate.  So really this place is middle of the road for me. Some good points, some bad. I'd give it a 2.5 stars if i could. But it's more of a 'meh' than an 'a-ok'..."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times for their buck-a-shuck oysters tues-sun 5-7pm. The oysters and calamari are delicious and they have really good cocktails, including my favourite the Snakebite and Black (cider, lager and cassis liqueur). The service is fantastic, but order a couple dozen oysters at a time because they tend to get a bit backed up."}
{"text":"The staff here are AWESOME. They were totally fine with us bringing the dogs onto the back patio and even brought a water bowl. +100000 points.   The food, unfortunately, left much to be desired. Small, simple and cheap, but not flavorful, I could have made better stuff at home for the same cost.  I will probably give them another try due to the level of service and proximity."}
{"text":"I am a pretty big fan of Bar Neon for a couple of reasons. As many of others have mentioned already, Buck a Shuck from 5-7pm is pretty fantastic. The back patio is one of my faves in the city, chill vibes, and lots of tables. Beer selection is decent, staff are friendly, the snacks are tasty (had the dip trio last time: tapenade/humus/beet), and I'm also a huge fan the penny floor in the bathroomsl!"}
{"text":"Four point five stars to be exact.   We first dropped in here a while ago for a quick beer en-route to a dinner engagement down the street. We loved the cheap pints for happy hour but also really liked the look of the place and made a note to return. We finally got around to that a couple of days ago and we were not disappointed. It was a nice day and we took our platters buck-a-shuck oysters on the back patio. The service was great, the beer selection to our taste and happy hour a deal. We had a selection from the menu as well and the food was solid. The place has a great vibe. It is nicely done up but unpretentious. The staff are chill and chatty (at the same time).   We got there pretty early and had a choice of tables but by the time we wobbled out into the early evening, it was hopping. Go early, go often."}
{"text":"So I went here on a Friday night with a friend while we were in the area.  What attracted us first was the dollar oysters.  Pretty good price but they were small but were fairly tasty (but not \"omg these are really good oysters\" tasty).  Great with a beer!  Not much beer selection but fair - had mill street organic and friend had the tea.  We also ordered the grilled calamari which had fresh capers and ingredients but again no wow factor.  Calamari could have more of a grill taste to it.  We also had their wings which was pretty good and juicy.  Unfortunately not enough of the actual wings...just one wing and the others drums.   Overall a fair restaurant but lost a star for lacklustre flavour and another for the price of what you get. Although a dollar oysters are a steal that's probably why I would return again if in the area."}
{"text":"Ok so when I went with a large group of people we literally filled the place. Drinks seemed to be strong...this could be because I hadn't eaten. As I am eating a GF, carb free diet I found the menu disappointing as there was not really anything I could eat (these days I am happy with a side salad, if need be!)   So yes, I felt like I got super drunk, the cocktail menu looked fantastic.   There is a smoking area out back.   Music was excellent, in our drunken happy state my friends and I sat singing and reminiscing!  I actually like this place, I just need to make sure I eat before I go out!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went there for the first time to try out their Happy Hour, and man am I glad that I did. From 5-7 you can get $5 pints and buck a shuck for oysters. The oysters were really fresh, which was great. We also ordered the olive tapanad, which I highly recommend. My boyfriend ordered a burger that he said was delish, and his feta fries were super tasty.   The service was really good. The waiter that welcomed us in was friendly and knowledgeable.  Quick staff and fast food considering the place was so busy. Loved the decor, and the music was perfect for the vibe. All and all, I have nothing bad to say about this place; except that they're so good that I may have to go there everyday haha."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere on a Saturday night. Loved the music. Great for a date. Cocktails were good.  Odd but unique food menu in my opinion.  Tried their sausage. It was ok. Go to Bar Neon on a Friday or Saturday night. It's a good hang."}
{"text":"De-li-cious! I can't even type. But if you want to know what I got???? Here goes!  *Oysters *Saganaki Bites *Burger and Feta Fries  Sooo good!"}
{"text":"This cute little spot on Bloor has won my admiration, exclusively based on it's backyard patio. This area seriously lacks patios so I was very happy to find this and now include in within my summertime haunts.  They have around 5 different beers and 1 cider on tap. $5.50 pints during happy hour! Small food menu including oysters, shareable dips, and a couple of entree sized options as well... But really, its just the patio that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Last night was my third time at bar neon and  I can say my experiences have been consistently good. Of course being a west coaster it has been the happy hour oyster deal that makes it a first choice but last night we also tried some of their other greek taps.... Warm olives (that lacked a little warmth) but tasted good, calamari which was excellent and when our friends arrived we ordered more,  and lastly my new favourite...feta frites. See the attached photo.  Service was good and as the place filled up they, thankfully, turned the music down a bit so we could hear each other speak.  I look forward to spending time on the back patio whe the weather warms up!!"}
{"text":"Asked the bartender for two of her favourite drink, they decided to make a mixed drink that was apparently $12 dollars so the bill racked up to $24 without telling me. Obvious cash grab..  $24 For two drinks. Wasn't worth a confrontation so I left, I will never recommend this bar to anyone nor will I ever return."}
{"text":"This place is okay. Although they have a neat little back patio (with firepit things) that may lure me back here in the warmer months, I wouldn't rush back otherwise.  We came for the happy hour buck-a-shuck oysters on a Sunday. The place was pretty dead but it still took a super long time for chef to shuck our dozen bivalves. They were big, meaty suckers...and not too shabby.  The menu is Greek themed so we tried:  Spanakopita - spinach and cheese in a deep-fried phyllo; just okay.  Saganaki - fried cheese...not great  Beet salad with yogurt dressing and crushed pistachios (not really a Greek dish, but still)...ho hum.  So basically, the food was meh. Cocktails were much better. Music was great. I'd come here to drink, if anything."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, Great service and great food. We ordered the duck confit flat bread with caramelized onion, potato and sage. Quite delicious.  Only odd thing was the soundtrack- N'Sync, Cher, Rob Thomas- very 1999.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I just can't. I came with a handful of friends on Saturday night just before midnight. The place was packed which seemed to be a good sign. We made our way to the back, ditched our coats and tried to get a drink at the bar.  The guy behind the bar was just standing there so we asked to get some drinks. Apparently this guy was a food guy and not a drinks guy and had just finished closing down the station. No big deal, we moved down and tried to order again. There were people sitting on stools at the bar and because the place was so packed there was no discernible way to get a drink. You sort of just have to reach over the people sitting at the bar and try to get the bartenders attention.  The music was good but it was so packed you couldn't dance if you wanted to. The bathrooms were nice and clean. Just watch out for the ceiling. While many places have low ceilings in the basement I had to fully tilt my head sideways to get down the hall.  Overall I had fun with my friends, but I just don't get the appeal of this place. Maybe it's a different experience earlier in the evening when they're serving food.

{"text":"I had the Calamari and Feta Fries. Calamari was really chewy and came with tsaziki sauce. The feta fries were round, fried potato slices tossed in herbs and oil with feta cheese grated all over it. The dish portions were enough to fill my friend and I, as we shared both. Food was good and service was friendly, but the place is super tight. Getting up to go to the washroom was a hassle because we would bump the tables next to us. Our table was also a little small and I ended up taking the candle that was on the table and placing it aside (on the bench next to me) so we could have more room and to assure that we wouldn't drop anything due to lack of space. Overall, a cute lil place (as long as you consider little to be cute) with great food!"}
{"text":"My favourite bar. The feta fries are the best. The patio is great in the summer. Also, they play great music on the weekends."}
{"text":"Came here to eat before going to a show at Burdock.  Had never heard of it before, but it looked warm and inviting with a good crowd on a stormy evening.  Hipster place (not that that's a bad thing).  730 on a Tuesday, with a couple of tables to spare.  Service was a bit spotty but friendly.  Food was really good.  Had the burger with feta fries.  The patty was cooked just right (a little under medium), and it had this great bun (though I couldn't tell you what kind).  Will definitely be ordering again in the future.  Tried a guest tap (some hoppy IPA) and my friend had the seasonal tap (a porter).  Both were really good but I forget the names.  Will be back next time I'm in the neighbourhood, and will definitely try some of their cocktails as they looked good.  Other notes: free WiFi but you have to ask for the password.  Tables were a bit wobbly and close together.  Don't sit near the door on a cold night."}
{"text":"This place is a nice local haunt.   They have a great happy hour special where drafts are 5$ each with buck-a-shuck oysters! As other reviewers have mentioned, service is slow on account of there only being one server and a tiny kitchen. However, if you're in no rush, the back patio is really cozy and beers are cold.  The oysters come with lemons, mignonette, horseradish and hot sauce (if you want) and they're small, but good. The burger with feta fries are good. The bun is a different kind of bread, that is crispier ad still nice and the patty actually tastes like meat. The feta fries are more like slices of fried potato with sprinkled cheddar.and a token piece of feta, but still tasty.   I would definitely come back fro the back patio on a hot summer day :)"}
{"text":"My friends and I went to Bar Neon for an early Friday dinner. We sat in their \"backyard\" patio, which was cutely decorated with hanging lightbulbs and picnic tables. Since it had such nice weather yesterday, the patio, which wasn't overly crowded when we got there, was a perfect choice for a small, relaxed get-together with a few close friends.   The menu was not your typical bar food, and I noticed a lot of greek inspired plates. My friends and I shared their pita & pita chips with 3 dips (potato and garlic, feta and arugula, and red caviar). I ordered a pork souvakli (comes with tatziki and some pita) and the greek poutine (meat sauce and cheese, which I can't remember thane of, but starts with a K). The pita dips were really interesting, covering a range of different & unique flavours, so each of us had our own \"favourite\" dip. The pork souvlaki was extremely tender and juicy. It was seasoned well and not overly salty, which I sometimes find when I eat souvlaki. The tatziki sauce wasn't anything special, but I'm generally happy with any tatziki anyway. My friends also ordered the chicken souvlaki and the oysters. They had raw oysters for one dollar each, but they were on the small side last night.  The drinks selection was what I wouldn't usually order, but I got a pint of Beaus Lug Tread because anything on tap was $5 before 8pm. They also had Mill St. Organic and Mill St. Lemon Tea Ale. They had quite a few bottle selections, but they were a bit pricy for my preference. My friend got a pimm's cocktail, which she really enjoyed.  Service was OK, and not something I am going to complain much about. They were very kind, but because we were outback, it was hard to catch their attention. Since we weren't in any rush, it wasn't a big deal for us. One thing, however, was that they originally charged me 6.20 for my beer, even though advertised to be $5 before 8pm. When I pointed it out, and they quickly revised the error.   If you're tall, you may have a bit of trouble with the washrooms! The ceiling is very low, so make sure you watch your head!"}
{"text":"First time here and I wasn't sure to expect. I had read reviews and so I decided to check it out. There is a lovely outdoor patio, but get there early to avoid waiting for a table. We ordered the calamari, sardines and pita and dip platter. All was tasty, but the calamari was a small portion for $12.00.  As an avid calamari eater, I've been to places where you get what you pay for; a decent sized dish.  Another thing I wasn't fond off was that our wine was served in regular drinking glasses. I'm not a prude but it would be nice to have wine served in proper wine glasses.  I won't return but I would suggest this place as a first time try out."}
{"text":"Blanche Chambly $6.20 /bottle  and buck a shuck. This is what heaven feels like."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come here almost every Friday.  Kelly and Barry are super friendly and they make strong drinks here.  I love the Caesar, Long Island Ice Tea, and Boston Ice Tea here.  A buck a shuck oyster before 7pm is my favourite, what a deal!  Feta fries are delicious too.  The bar is cozy, decoration was nice, back patio is great for chilling in the summer and fall.  Sometimes when it's cold outside, they would give us marshmallow to roast over the outdoor fireplace, because they are awesome like that.  They have a DJ later at night, he usually plays good dance music.  We always feel welcome and have fun here."}
{"text":"Super love this place!! The wait staff are very amazing, friendly, helpful and attentive. The back patio is very cozy. The food is wonderful, in particular the cod fritters and the pulled pork profiteroles. The atmosphere is very relaxed, with all types of people and ages in attendance. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Love this bar. Kelly and Barry make it the best place to have a drink and unwind after a long week. Amazing old fashioneds and dark & stormy cocktails. Also the feta fries kill!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a couple of years now, and it's only getting better with age.  Although Sam's no longer around, Barry, Laurel and Kelly are the sweetest people in the neighbourhood. Barry's no BS- attitude and killer margarita skills also help.  There is still the $5 pint and buck-a-shuck oyster happy hours, but 1/2 price bottles of wine after 7 on Mondays and 1/2 price wings on Tuesday keep it interesting.  The menu continues to evolve with mostly successful results. In addition to the solid wings, cheese board and calamari, there are some real treats. The grilled radicchio was a pleasant surprise, and this is the only place where I've willingly eaten Okra more than once."}
{"text":"great little tapas menu including fresh oysters, fantastic"}
{"text":"Another patio in my neighbourhood I didn't know existed! Hurrah! There are still, I think, at least 30 days of patio sitting in this city's future. Maybe more if we're lucky. So, I will very likely be returning to this surprisingly large, wooden bench laden, warmly lit home of beer consumption again before year's end."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars. Greek tapas place with a hipster vibe. Really reasonable prices! 4 of us had 2 tapas each with several drinks and the bill was still less than $100! There's a cute outdoor patio too. Great music selection! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Bar Neon is a welcome new addition to the Bloodale Village neighborhood.  This little gem has a cool vibe that makes you want to hang out, have a few drinks and some delicious snacks courtesy of the culinary genius of Ivan.  The kitchen is more of a cleverly set up counter with everything you need to create the small but tasty selection of tapas on the menu.  The staff is friendly and happy to chat and give you all the details on what's good. Truthfully we were enticed by the oysters which got us out on a Wednesday night in the first place and ended up having a couple of drinks and a taste of Ivan's take on a Croque Monsieur which I must say puts any other Croque Monsieur I have ever had to SHAME.  It was buttery, creamy, full of texture and complex amazing flavours to make your taste buds dance with joy.  The Oysters were fresh, tasty and perfectly shucked which again not many places can pull off, leaving you to rip the oyster off its shell rather than just pouring it in your mouth to enjoy.  If we hadn't had dinner already and it wasn't a Wednesday night, we would have stayed all night and enjoyed the rest of the menu which I'm certain is to die for as was everything else we tried. The menu items range from 12-14 except the oysters which are at Market price. While I wouldn't recommend this place for dinner per say, I would say it's an awesome place to go to hang out with some friends, have a few drinks and enjoy the bite size tasters they have to offer. Once again, welcome to the hood, our taste buds are so delighted to have you here. I can't wait to hang out on the patio this summer."}
{"text":"what's not to like about buck-a-shuck oysters and a sunny patio? epitome of local haunt vibes, this place is perfect for eating a weird amount of shellfish with your pals.   service can be prettyyyy slow during happy hour. the servers seem to give no cares, which could be infuriating, but they're so sweet that their ambivalence is kinda charming? idk. maybe (definitely) i'm more emo generous when things are cheap and i've had 2 ciders."}
{"text":"I am going to update my review for Bar Neon, because it was written in the depths of January. Find me a Canadian who isn't a little bit bitchier in the winter, and I'll question their humanity.   Though I maintain I have bad luck with their wines by the glass, these are the things I love about Bar Neon:  +Their massive back patio with ample seating  +Their fun wall signage  +Their obliging and funny servers +Decent beer list +Excellent sangria (bad wine is A OK in sangria)  +Their above average snack selection (people go nuts for the wings)"}
{"text":"I don't know why it had taken me so long to finally come here. I came here on the Labor Day Monday, in search of a patio, pint and food. Bar Neon delivered.   Great drink selection, especially a solid small draft selection of 6-7 beers plus a cider on tap. Also featuring a happy hour between 5-7pm for $5 pints and $1 oysters. The menu is Greek-inspired featuring Greek tapas, dips and dished to choose from.   I enjoyed the chicken souvlaki with salad with a few pints on the patio. It was perfection.    I can't wait to come back for some more drinks! Great neighbourhood find!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night to get a bite to eat before another activity at. I was a bit apprehensive when I saw how busy it was but the service was excellent! It was really busy and with good reason, the food is delicious. We ordered oysters and Greek fries. What a delicacy! Great atmosphere too, I love this place and I will definitely be back."}
