{"text":"Was brought here and told the dim sum was good. The dim sum was ok, but not great. It wasn't really anything to write home about.

I was told that one of the top hong kong chefs is here in this resto, but it didn't really taste all that different than any other typical dim sum restaurant.

I found the service so-so, even though some of the staff were from a previous restaurant (Golden Court) and they knew us and we were semi-VIP treatment.  I found it horrible that when setting up the table, this bowl had a huge stain/grime on the side of it, and the hostess decided to try to wipe it off on the tablecloth.  She couldn't get rid of it, and just put it aside.  At the end of setting up the table, she totally forgot the bowl was dirty and put a spoon in it and was about to leave.  I had to point out the grime so she would take it away.

Overall I gave it 2 stars due to the food not being amazing and the dirt on the utensils and bowls.  I would not repeat willingly, but since my parents like this place, I probably will be back at some point.

They do have a special for lobster e-fu noodle and crab rice, but still not enough to get me to go on my own."}
{"text":"Food was excellent. We came to this restaurant for dim sum and found there was quite the variety. Ordering is via a sheet where you write down what you want. They also did away with the traditional carts that go around with food and replaced it with an advanced ordering system. 

Service was horrible and indications of this were evident shortly after being seated. We had to ask 5 separate servers for a high chair and eventually got one 20 minutes later.

Restaurant is located on the second level of the strip plaza. Access can be had via the south doors where an escalator and elevator are present for those who need it. 

My rating is weighted heavily towards the poor service we experienced. This poor service is enough for me to say no more to this restaurant.  It should be noted that my background is Asian and despite this and the knowledge that most Asian restaurants aren't highly regarded for service,  I still feel it was below my already low expectations."}
{"text":"We heard Ka Lung Court was good for dim sum, but our schedule only allowed us to try dinner here.  We ordered the set dinner for 10 since we were 10 adults plus several light eating kids, and ended up with enough leftover to feed perhaps another three or four starving men.

The food was good.  Service could have been better - it was tough for us to get someone to bring us the bill when we were done.  Oh, and the waiter mangled the filleting of the fish.

Loved their version of the 'jello' dessert.  We paid $30 per adult."}
