{"text":"On 5/28/13,  NINE, count them... NINE violations from the health inspector!  And looking, they have a long continued history of violations going back 2 years!  OMG UPDATE: 8-6-14  CHECK THIS OUT!!!!! They were cooking food in a propane pot out back of the restaurant!  The Health Dept website changed:  NEW one is: http://envapp.maricopa.gov/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodSearchInspection?p=FD-10605&i=0  07/24/17   Since my reviews back in 2013-14, They have improved on their last  4 inspections.  When they fail, They CONSISTENTLY fail regarding keeping temperatures properly hot and cold AND cross-contamination write-ups.   I'll STILL pass...  Lets see what happens up to the end of 2017.  06/27/2017 Routine Inspection       Not Participating          0 02/28/2017 Routine Inspection                    A                     0 12/14/2016 Routine Inspection                    A                     0 10/13/2016 Advisory                                                           0 09/09/2016 Routine Inspection       Not Participating          2 06/14/2016 Routine Inspection       Not Participating          1 02/24/2016 Routine Inspection       Not Participating          1 12/07/2015 Re-Inspection                                                   0 12/04/2015 Routine Inspection       Not Participating          0 09/18/2015 Routine Inspection       Not Participating          1 06/17/2015 Routine Inspection       Not Participating          1 03/18/2015 Routine Inspection       Not Participating          0 11/18/2014 Routine Inspection       Not Participating         NA 07/25/2014 Complaint Inspection   Not Participating         NA"}
{"text":"Scratch ingredient Mexican food. Delicious! Salsas are hot, numerous and flavorful. Even the tortillas are scratch. This is not the kind of industrialized-gringo-Mexican-food available from Fairbanks to Florida. Mexican soaps are on the TV, most of the tables and chairs are a mis-match and Jesus is crucified on the wall. Been here twice, never heard a lick of English spoken at the other tables. Fuckiberto and other chain-food follower won't get it."}
{"text":"The food was just okay. Super greasy from the lard in the beans and meat was not of good quality. The tortillas they used were very good though. But because if the grease pouring out of my burrito I couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years with my family and we have never had a bad experience. The family is attentive, the place is kind of small but the salsas are just like the ones coming out of my nanas house (I'm first generation here in America). The chili rellenos are a must try! Try to play around with the salsas on the chili rellenos to add extra flavor. Also... The caldo de rez is incredible. We honestly would pick this restaurant for our authentic over any other around the neighborhood hands down.... And it helps that their prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Nothing really blows your socks off here for it being mexican food. It is good, and it hits the spot. Definitely a better alternative than the los betos and filibertos because its the same price but way better food.  Not top quality. I like the place though.  The respados here suck though, so steer clear.  Tortas are good and their version of a papusa (i forget what they call it here, gordos or something that is taco bell reminiscent) are my top recommendations"}
{"text":"Amazing food made from scratch delicious delicious yumm yumm all employees are very nice and friendly especially the young lady named Gabriela. My enchiladas were Incredibly tasty and amazing! Loved the service. Five stars"}
{"text":"Came to have some lunch with my family we all got different food. I have to admitted it was awesome I love the chiken they serve here. I got the plate which had 3 sides of meat,beans,rice and some delicious flour tortillas which where home made. The horchata was delicious. The guy that works here right away greet us and our drinks came out pretty fast. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"This turned out to be beyond my expectations! The food is very authentic! Their salsa bar is home made with great taste and a great kick. Have a vast assortment of tacos and their beans are amazing! Their mexican style drinks are fresh .and you get homemade tortillas. Very clean and owner is very friendly."}
