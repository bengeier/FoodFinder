{"text":"AMAZING food and very cool atmosphere! Their newly renovated bar and lounge give you a cool city club feel without the long drive into Pittsburgh. This is exactly what me and my friends have been looking for locally. They also have a awesome outdoor patio with live music every Friday during the summer that we absolutely LOVE!! The service is phenomenal with long standing people that really take the time to get to know their customers and their needs. If you are looking for a great night out with amazing food/drinks, and lots of good energy and vibes then Jacksons is your place! Jacksons is our favorite restaurant in Washington county!!"}
{"text":"So we tried again Saturday night and it is just not good.  None of us really liked anything but the pizza.  I had Grouper and it was super salty.  The service was good.  The bar is nice.  There were 4 of us and our bill was a little over $200.  I can think of $200 reasons we won't return to Jackson's.  It is just not worth it."}
{"text":"Jackson's seems to be one of the few places for lunch in the Southpointe area, so we ventured out for a lunch meeting with new clients.  The service was fine, but the food was not as spectacular as i had hoped.  I had the crab cake salad, and it was good, but not outstanding.  Maybe I expected too much.  I have eaten at the Jackson's in Moon and perceived the food was better, but that was some time ago and maybe I am wrong.  The prices are a bit high, but prices have gone up everywhere.    I'll try it again and hope to be able to increase the rating next time around."}
{"text":"Jackson's is a staple for us and I highly recommend you try them if you are looking for good food and good service.  They have wonderful food and we have never been disappointed in anything we have ordered.  They regularly have specials, and they are in the process of adding additional items to the menu and/or rotating some new dishes into their repertoire.  We have had just about everything on their menu.  Steak, fish, meat sauce (a hearty and delicious pasta dish), duck, crab cake, the shrimp & chorizo chowder, calamari, and of course, desserts which change regularly....and we have enjoyed all of these dishes.   Jackson's starts your meal out with a wonderful basket of bread and spreads, including their cheese/herb bread sticks which are made in their wood fired oven with their wonderful pizza dough.  They are addictive, so be careful not to indulge too much before your meal shows up!   We often times will get a Caesar, house salad, or wedge salad.  They are all good and satisfy my need for a crisp salad.  Do try the red velvet cheesecake if it is on the menu when you go.  You will be delighted.  But we have enjoyed the creme brûlée and other desserts that are rotated seasonally.    The service is warm, friendly, and spot on.  Ask for Martin or Ruth.  They will treat you very well and help you with any questions you have.  They know us quite well by now.  The restaurant has several different dining areas to meet your desires for the time.  They have a bar area, an outdoor seating area with live music on the weekends, and the indoor dining room.  The decor has been recently updated at it is sharp and appealing.    Do NOT be thrown off by the fact that it is directly adjacent to a hotel.  It is not hotel food by any stretch.  This restaurant is a gem that you should try."}
{"text":"Jacksons in Southpointe is WONDERFUL!  The atmosphere is warm and cozy.  The food was delicious - Ahi Tuna and Organic Irish Salmon are two excellent dinner choices.  Jacksons is the only place I order AppleTini's they are made to perfection.  As far as service - second to none - request Martin - he is awesome!  ShelleyF in McDonald"}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to a nice dinner at Jackson's.  We hadn't been there for awhile and our previous experiences were all excellent.  I had the prime rib and it was a huge portion!  I was disappointed though as it was tough and not a lot of flavor other than the peppery rub on the outside.  My husband had the mahi mahi and it was over cooked.  Our friends had the scallops and though the scallops were done nicely, there were just three in the dish and  way too much pasta to round out the entree.  The noise level in the restaurant was quite unpleasant.  I will say the wait staff was very good and so was the wine selection.  I wished I had enjoyed the evening more but the food didn't shine and the noise was deafening.  Unfortunately we probably won't return."}
{"text":"The brussel sprouts are perfectly marinated and cooked where they are a bit crispy! A great way to start the night."}
{"text":"Jackson's is connected to the Hilton Garden Inn located at Southpointe. If you remember that this restaurant caters to the transient hotel guest, then you'll be setting the expectation correctly. These people will likely never be back, so who cares what their experience is?   The host/hostess was very friendly when we first arrived. Good initial impression. The decor is very nice. Nice bar. Modern facility. Reasonably busy on a Friday night.   We came for the live Jazz which was played outdoor on their patio. Beautiful patio with the exception that the parking lot is 10ft from the edge of it. It feels like if someone backed up too far they might hit you.   They have both ceiling fans and outdoor heaters, so I can see this could be used for a large part of the Pittsburgh year.   The service was about as slow as it could possibly be. There was supposedly a rehearsal dinner but some things shouldn't be affected. For instance, getting a diet coke shouldn't take 20 minutes. For the slow service, they offered to comp a round of drinks, which of course they forgot to take off the bill. Simply bad service. Not unfriendly, just really really slow.   The food is a mixed bag. Some of it was fairly tasty. The shrimp and chorizo chowder was good, but the portion size was absurdly small for a bowl. The filet tips were delicious. The crab cake appetizer was good.   The short ribs good. The filet had an acrid wine reduction that was practically inedible. Does anyone in the kitchen taste their sauces?   Fruit tart was disgusting. The chocolate velvet(?) cake was really good.   So all in all, it's a mixed bag. The ambiance is alright, the service sucks, some food is very good.   The prices aren't cheap, and despite taking advantage of the $55 fixed price, drinks still put the bill over the top. In good faith, I cannot recommend this place."}
{"text":"Paul The FOOD SUCKED.    I nicely mentioned my experience, and asked for a refund for my bad food. You Replied:  Jon,  After investigation we are unable to grant your request. We are disappointed that we did not fulfill your dining expectations here at Jacksons-Restaurant-Bar. If I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to call.  Paul S. Bazzano  Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh/Southpointe  1000 Corporate Drive  Canonsburg Pa 15317  Paul, appreciate the investigation, exactly what was investigated, can you detail for me.  As I said service excellent, I tipped well, 2 Cheese plates good, food not so good. Is that all?  Frankly, I had a good time.  I am not asking for much, except a refund for the meals. If these are your thoughts on the matter, service and quality count. I will never eat there again nor could I by conscience stay at that Hilton again, nor could I recommend to any that it is worth the time or money. I work for a large company in the area, oil and gas, what should I say... stay at the Hilton and get MC D's to go, you will enjoy more than Jacksons. Marketing is everything, I'd prefer a refund of the money, for the meals, simple and easy.  Cook had a hangover.., bad day...?  Happens.  Your Thoughts please, and normally I do not bitch, but the truth is, meals bad. I appreciate your time- Jon  Never heard another word"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Jackson's. I've eaten here several times for lunch and like my food each & every time. The restaurant is extremely clean, the service is good, and the food is delicious. I also love that they offer outdoor seating when the weather permits. Jackson's is a great addition to the Hilton Garden Inn. You can't beat the crab cakes! The crab cake salad is my go to & it never disappoints. I also love the wedge chicken salad and the corn chowder. If you've never eaten here, I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Like any beer drinker , I expect atleast a few beers on tap..Jackson's had only 4 to offer . The food is pricey for the quantity . Ordered:-  the calamari appetizer- not great . The crab cake- just 1 but nice  The pan seared chicken - excellent  The bar is nice, the place has got a good vibe to it and it is crowded - the 2 times that I have been here ..the outdoor patio is nice too. Definitely worth it if you are staying at the Hilton Garden Inn!"}
{"text":"Like probably most of the patrons in here on a Monday night, I was staying at the Hilton next door.  I got to the hotel at 8pm after flying all day and then driving from the airport so I didn't really feel like venturing out into an unfamiliar area for dinner.  I sat at the bar, which had a couple TV's on.    I was quickly greeted by a rather attractive bartender who welcomed me and took my drink order.  When she returned with my glass of house Pinot Noir, she asked if I needed a dinner menu.   A minute or two later she brought me a dinner menu and told me about the specials.  The Pinot wasn't the best glass of wine, but decent enough. A few minutes later after I closed my menu, another bartender (a far less attractive male) stopped by to see if I wanted to order or just hang out for a while.  I really appreciate service that's attentive like this without being pushy.    I was hungry so I ordered, but he probably would have been cool if I'd sat there all night sipping my wine.  And I suppose I can't fault the guy for not being the attractive young lady who'd originally been serving me ;)  I started with the Shrimp & Chorizo Chowder which was excellent.  I'd put it on the \"must have\" list for anybody dining here.  I had one of the specials, the blackened monk fish, as my entree.  It was also quite good, but perhaps slightly underdone in the center.  I'm talking just barely though and it was a thick piece of fish.  The roasted garbanzo beans and potato puree were excellent as well and complimented the seasoning on the fish quite well.  They also brought me a basket of bread which was probably overkill but both varieties I tried where a nice compliment to the chowder.     I had a second glass of wine, this time a Cab.  The bartender commented that the Pinot wasn't his favorite either as he brought me the second glass.  All in all, for what I was wanting that evening it was just about perfect; just on the edge of getting 5 starts from me in fact, which I never do.  I don't know when I'll be back in the area and I'm usually not one to stay in the hotel for dinner, but Jackson's just might tempt me to do so next time.  Even if I don't get the pretty bartender next time."}
{"text":"A fine place to eat."}
{"text":"This is one of those places you just have to be prepared to drop a couple extra duckies.  I mean c'mon.  As long as you're going to do it .... just do it right.  I was actually within walking distance from my work to Jackson's at one point, until we moved.  It's a very solid restaurant with a good menu, great service, and decent atmosphere.  Yea, it's not 5 star but it's pretty close.  As least everytime I've been there.  Even though I don't work close anymore, I still like to venture up to ol Jackson's once in awhile ....  You should do the same!!"}
{"text":"A colleague and I had the tasting menu. Comfortably priced menu. Good portions. Good tasting food. The chef has a garden out back where he grows his on vegetables and herbs. Waiter was appropriately attentive and made valuable suggestions. Not the best I've eaten but good for a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"I am only writing a review based on their lunch special.  We went for the under $10 lunch special and everything was really good. I had the Bbq chicken sandwich which was awesome and everyone else seemed to like their sandwiches as well.  We sat out side and everything was clean.   The only thing I could say that they could improve on is wait time. The food came out a little slow but it could be do to a number of different things."}
{"text":"Hit or Miss - great place to sit outside under the awning sometimes...just tried to do that - counted over 13 open tables and was told that they all were reserved!  Ok we will sit inside - but after 15 minutes of zero service - we left and on the way out counted 14 open tables under the awning.  We live in the neighborhood and luckily several new places have opened in Southpointe."}
{"text":"I was kept standing at the door waiting to be seated for 10 minuets.  The service was fair had to ask for a refill. The food was very good"}
{"text":"Whether you're the ritzy, high class folk or plain old just trying to impress someone, this is NOT the place for you. Although Jacksons reputation is held to a very high standard and is notably very expensive, it is not worth the time or money.   There is not much variety to the menu at Jacksons. They offer certain dishes with certain sides, and the servers get very upset when you ask them to substitute something. Upon receiving your food, you will find that the portion sizes are subpar, and the food is mediocre, considering the standard it is held to.   I have been to Jacksons quite a few times (even for wedding rehearsal dinners) and have had a pretty bland experience every time. You would think that for the amount of money you're spending, the servers would be around more and be a bit friendlier. However, I guess if you're getting gratuity on a very high priced meal, you aren't that concerned with customer service.   If you are going on a date, I would plan on spending minimum $130. Obviously this is way more if you get drinks, dessert, etc."}
{"text":"While the restaurant serves the hotel, it also has a lot of traffic from Southpointe.   I've only been for lunch and it's a good spot to stop.   It's a little pricey and upscale, but the specials are good and pretty tasty.   The outdoor patio is nice. Ceiling fans help keep it cool.   Servers are friendly. Food service is kinda slow."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Hilton Garden Inn next door so I ended up eating here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.   For lunch, I order the cheesesteak, which had good flavor but they put au jus on the bread instead of giving it on the side for dipping so by the time your sandwich gets to you it's falling apart a bit. My coworker ordered the ham and cheese on pretzel bun. I stole a bite and it was really good and cheesy.   For dinner, I ordered their ribeye special which came with lemony broccolini and a crazy good blue cheese sauce. The sides are different for the special, but they always have a ribeye on the menu and believe me, you should order it. They cook it on their mesquite grill that beautifully charred the meat but left the inside juicy and perfectly medium. A restaurant rarely cooks the steak to the right temp that you ask for, so that was a very pleasant surprise. There wasn't too much fat in the ribeye either, which was great. It was delicious and made the whole dinner worth it. My coworker ordered the meat sauce pasta and said she loved it! Dinner service was SOOO slow though, so that's why I'm taking off a point. Oh and their Bloody Mary was really bad and watered down, so if you're craving one, this isn't the place for it."}
{"text":"Bread with garlic aioly spread and black olive spread was a good starter. shrimp chorizo chowder was delicious! Oso bucco pork shank (bone-in) was huge and tender; fall-off-the-bone good! Mashed potatoes were creamy Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Had a really nice lunch experience today.  Was at a meeting at the hotel and only had a half an hour for lunch.  Both of the servers on the patio waited on me and were super sweet.  Had a large and tasty pannini off the power lunch menu.  So big I tool half with me. Included a drink and fries for 8.75.  Check came with chocolate cookies."}
{"text":"Martin, our server, was wonderful. He helped with making our selections and his recommendations were exactly what we got.  The entrees were prepared perfectly. Definitely will be back to Jackson's in the near future."}
{"text":"Good food and a nice place for a sit down lunch."}
{"text":"I work in Southpointe, so my coworkers and I visit Jacksons frequently for lunch, and it NEVER disappoints! You really cannot beat their $10 power lunch. Your choice of lunch option comes with a drink, fries, and coleslaw. The atmosphere inside is so nice and the staff is always friendly. I haven't been to Jackson's for dinner yet, but I bet it's even better than their lunch! 10/10 for sure!"}
{"text":"I am giving 4 stars, because the food is not so great, but the service is. I have been there 3 times and each time was treated like royalty.  Now if only the quality of the food was better, I would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was terrible. Waiting for our check forever. Actually still waiting"}
{"text":"I've had lunch there 4 times even though they basically have ONE non-meat choice on the lunch menu (c'mon people - pay attention to the trends!). Anyway, the item's been usually nice and the so has been the service, but yesterday, not so much. I was eating w/ some coworkers and asked for a veggie soup. They didn't have any neither offered to try making one. No worries there, meat happens. But then when I started eating my wrap, it had way too much salt in it. Like \"they put salt in, and then they forgot they put it in and doubled up on it\" much. I wanted to be as polite as possible and waited for someone to ask me how my food was. No one did. Then I looked around a little helplessly like you do when you're flanked by taller people in a booth setting, but to no avail.   So it came down to just making do w/ fries or eat tablespoons of salt and make do with water. I chose the latter and needless to say, left with a bad taste in my mouth.   Their fries are good though!"}
{"text":"Food was not fresh. Ate here with several people and we were stuck with stomach ache for the rest of the evening.  Oh, and why is it always so freezing cold here?!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed a Valentine's meal here. We were seated promptly in a somewhat drafty area of the dining room.  On the whole the food was good. In particular the scallop appetizer was particularly appealing. Shrimp and chorizo soup and tomato bisque were both flavorful. The entrees were a small letdown. My wife tried monkfish for the first time and was not impressed, more by the fish than the preparation.  My beef tips were tender but not overly flavorful.  We agreed we would like to return. The prices were a little high, but overall we were happy. The next visit I will likely limit myself to an appetizer/soup OR an entree. Not only will that be more healthy it will be a bit less expensive too."}
{"text":"I suspect that the majority of the guests who eat at this restaurants are guests from the Hilton Hotel, in which this very establishment is located.  At least that's why I ate there, and while I don't necessarily regret choosing this seemingly fancy diner that evening, I don't plan on coming back in the near or distant future.   The food was fine, and I do feel bad that I squished the tiny bug which ran across my salad plate.   The waiter was nice (unlike another reviewer here I did not have the luck of being served by an attractive waitress) although not terribly speedy when it came to clearing the table or bringing the bill.   At least the dinner was better than the breakfast they offer at the Hilton. Although I didn't actually bother to try that to be honest."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but not for the price. Had the bill been cut in half I would have few complaints. The calamari was chewy and there were some wilted pieces of lettuce in the salad. The salmon came out bland though moist. I am not generally picky but when we spend $200 on dinner for 2 this is just not what I expect."}
{"text":"If the quality of the cuisine were the only barometer in rating a restaurant, I would provide Jackson's five stars. The menu can be pricey with entrees ranging from $17 to $55.  Some of the dishes include only bread.  The menu is limited, but everything we ordered was delicious: wedge lettuce salad ($7), pasta bolognese ($17), and the excellent, unique bread basket, which includes one that is pizza-like.  Butter should be included along with the tapenades or the diner asked if he or she wants butter with his or her bread.  Grated or shredded cheese should be offered for pasta dishes.  The restaurant is attractive, but it is not comfortable.  Tables for two are small and one is placed a couple of inches from the next table.  The noise was deafening throughout much of the evening on this busy Saturday night.  This is not the place for an intimate meal as one must speak loudly to their companion in order to be heard; even then, it is difficult.  Our server was pleasant, but not sufficiently attentive.  Water was not refilled as needed and a quality check was performed only when we were halfway through our meals.  The restaurant lacks bussers who could help.  I recognize anew how much more the superb Franco's Trattoria of Peters Township offers, including a quiet, comfortable environment and Italian cuisine that is second to none and fairly priced. At Franco's I could have enjoyed a pasta dinner for $14 or a chicken parmigiana dinner for $17, both of which include a huge serving of excellent chicken pastina soup.  Additionally, Franco's offers a great rendition of the Pittsburgh favorite, fried zucchini, something which is not on the menu at Jackson's."}
{"text":"I did not have a  long times to visit to Piitsbourgh's downtown area, so I decided eat in hotel's restaurant. This place is located inside of Doubletree hotel near Pittsbourgh airport where most of hotel are located. Their power lunch is really cheap and pretty okay to me. 1/2 sandwich, soup or salad, drink all togeather was only $6.50. What deal of the meal for the lunch. I ordered 1/2 chicken panini and potato soup, and both of them was tasty not bad at all for price of $6.50. If you stay near any hotel or motel near Pittsbourgh airport, stop by for cheap and nice lunch at Jacksons."}
{"text":"My schedule had me dining twice at Jackson's in the same day this week. Once for lunch and once for a bite to eat during happy hour. Both times left me quite underwhelmed. To start with lunch. I had the Club Sandwich which may have been the worst club sandwich that I have ever had. Some cold cuts pilled tightly on two pieces of limp white bread with a handful of overcooked French fries. Yuck. My lunch companion had an underwhelming salmon salad.   Later in the day I met a colleague for Happy Hour at the bar and had their Brie Dip and Pita Bread. The Brie Dip was horrible (and I love Brie) and the Pita chips were cold and lifeless. No reason to ever order this again.   This may be a good place to get a drink but there are so many other good places around to eat. If this place had to stand alone instead of being tied to a restaurant it would be out of business"}
{"text":"I live within a few miles of Jacksons, but I recently went there for the first time. The standard reviews I've heard from word of mouth were all along the lines of 'nice, a little upscale, expensive but good, etc.'   My favorite Local band was playing there Friday night, so that was all I needed to give it a try.    Everything I heard about the place was true. The ambiance was nice. It was everything you'd expect from a nice hotel restaurant. The menu wasn't huge, but there was a diverse selection.   Our table of four to six quickly became a table for ten, which the restaurant accommodated even after two of us arrived early and were seated. The host and server were very professional and accommodating.   Presentation was obviously important to the restaurant and it showed. Maybe I'm not as upscale as most people, but everything was lovely without being pretentious. I ordered the soup du jour (shrimp bisque) which was phenomenal. For $6, I expected a tiny cup, but it was a generous sized portion in a bowl.    While I'm not a fancy salad guy, I figured I've give the chop salad a go. It was better than I expected. It's hard to screw up a salad, but I've seen it done before. The candied walnuts were terrific. For my entree, I ordered the scallops in ginger sauce. The menu said they were served with ramen noodles and I've really wanted to expand my ramen experiences. I was a poor college student once and I still like cheap ramen on occasion. I know you can get good ramen out there, so I figured I'd give it a go. It came with four scallops and a heaping portion of ramen mixed with some vegetables in a ginger sauce. I have a decent sized appetite, but I had to get the last of my meal to go. I ate it today (cold) and it was still good.   Add a couple of Guinness drafts for me and we had a hefty bill, but I don't think that would stop me from returning again. Besides, if you use the 'other' restaurant reservation app that's the opposite of 'Closed Table', it's a 1,000 point restaurant.   The restrooms were exceptionally clean and the staff was friendly. The bar area was crowded, but it was a Friday (early) evening. The band was supposed to play out on the patio, but the weather curtailed that idea. I would be excited to re-visit Jacksons and dine outside.    Four of five stars in my review, but only because I can't give 4.5 out of 5. I think the prices could be cut back a little and the set-up was a little odd for a two-piece musical group. Also, the chairs might be good for people with perfect posture, but it felt like they made me lean too far forward. A weird thing, I know, but others may party mentioned the same thing.   Definitely give it a try if you don't mind dropping a C-note on dinner for two."}
{"text":"Had the pork chops, fantastic.  Ate at the bar and the bar servers were the best. Highly recommend. Very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We had lunch here while on our stay at the hotel this week.  I tried the A1 Burger, which was delicious and the other guys I was meeting with for work had some other plates that they all mentioned were pretty good.  Although food was great, just be prepared for your clothes to smell very smokey from the grill that is a bit overwhelming in the restaurant.  We had lunch there yesterday and the smell from my clothes has carried over into my hotel room overnight.  If you're ok with having to air them out and have a day or so before packing your clothes back into a suitcase to fly, then this is a great choice in the local area to grab a meal."}
{"text":"As a Houston native, this place is not bad for rural Pittsburgh. Place has great ambiance, great service, and good food. I had the salmon which was light and extremely tasty. I also had some flatbread as an appetizer which was pretty good.  The bar is pretty nice too. Lots of screen for watching the games. Go Texans!"}
{"text":"Scallops were brine tasting. Clothes smell like smoke from the kitchen. Lackluster food and service with a big tab."}
{"text":"Friendly service and beautiful interior and atmosphere.  So nice, you don't mind how slow the service is, perfect if you're looking for a chill chance to catch up with friends, family, or clients.  Expensive entrees, but very reasonable lunch specials under $10, that are tasty, high quality, well portioned, and freshly prepared.  As long as you're not in a rush, this is one of the best places in the area."}
