{"text":"If you are a vegetarian,  the lack of variety is a problem.   Yuan is a break.  They have many dishes that not available anywhere else.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food didn't have any taste. We had the Tofu, ginger and basil and the Plaisir de Bouddha, both tasted like water. Service was just ok. I wouldn't recommend this place even for vegetarian/vegan."}
{"text":"Locale molto spazioso e pulito. Interessante la formula pranzo e cena che puoi ordinare quello che vuoi per un prezzo stabilito (cena 20 cad). Conviene alla grande. Abbiamo visto anche il menù alla carta e se prendi 2 cose più o meno sei arrivato alla cifra. Personale cordiale e disponibile ad aiutarti. All'ingresso ti danno il menù e ti segni tutto quello che vuoi, ma devi finire tutto, altrimenti devi pagare un extra. Cibo buono di qualità ma i piatti sono poco curati. Si vede lo stile cinese... Consiglio per vegetariani e vegani."}
{"text":"Always super delicious! The all-you-can-eat comes in made-to-order small portions, so you can taste and share everything their menu has to offer! I keep coming back, and am always pleased with both the food and the friendly service. They have an awesome little shop in front too, where you can buy their homemade vegetation delights and meat substitutes!"}
{"text":"Food= 9/10   Atmosphere=7/10    Eat here, Vegan(tarians)! Get the Curry Steak. Its amazing. Don't bother with the bbq balls. Do the buffet so you can try everything. They make it for you when you order. This compares to NYC Vegan places like Red Bamboo."}
{"text":"Asian vegetarian restaurant, which means a lot of dishes are made of tofu to assimilate the meat. My caucasien friends don't really like this type of vegetarian food. So be careful if you are the same. The taste is average in general. The best dish is the Stir-fried tofu with ginger and basil."}
{"text":"Degueulasse et rien à faire dans le milieu vegetarien. Ce restaurant ressemble à une cantine, sans aucun charme ni chaleur. La plupart de ces plats sont trempés dans l'huile (à la cuisson). 1h30 d'attente pour le lunch et obligé de partir sans avoir recu nos plat (avec une salle quasiment vide). Un service deplorable et j'en passe. Si vous avez tu temps à perdre, alors essayez le, mais a votre risque et peril."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Not just restaurant they also sell food to cook at home. I tried thr Buffe really nice. My fav: ravioli with penout sauce,the soya brochette,General Tao chicken, steak with pineapple sauce... Almost everything.  Highly recommended. Certainly I will be back"}
{"text":"Food was good, but service was not.  As we were there around 8:30 pm and asked for Buffet but were told that buffet will be served till 9 pm and as such only one round will be served. although restaurant is open for dinner till 10 pm.  So we ordered Ala-carte. A table of 6 six people across who were there were being served buffet were being served round after round of buffet till nearly 9:45 pm. So on our way out I inquired, how come these people were being served buffet till now and we were refused, although we had come from Toronto and visited the restaurant on very high recommendation for, service and food, and he just looked at me and was speechless. Sorry but this is not acceptable."}
{"text":"This was me and my fiancées first vegan restaurant experience, and it was AMAZING! Though service was a bit slow to start once we got our buffet choices in it was very fast. The general Tao and pineapple \"chicken\" was awesome  and I had to verify with the waiter that it wasn't meat. Though a little pricy I will defiantly be back for more. Try this place out, you won't regret it !"}
{"text":"I love this place. Ideal restaurant for vegetarians to take their carnivore friends to without them complaining about how much they hate tofu. Very vast menu offering something for everyone. All you can eat menu is a great idea for groups to share as the plates are small you can get a few of each dish, see what everyone likes and then order the favorites the next round (if you are a glutton like me). The food is a bit heavy (but very tasty) as most of it is faux meat and mostly fried. The vegetable dishes and sushi are good as well.  Cons: generally slow service and I often find it to be pretty cold in this restaurant, so bring a sweater lol"}
{"text":"J'ai simplement adoré ce restaurant. Il deviendra par prédilection mon restaurant préféré asiatique. Et le fait que ce soit végé, c'est juste parfait. Le végé-poulet à l'ananas est délicieux, comme tout ce que j'ai mangé d'ailleurs! (Brocoli, pizza-sushi, soupe wonton, samosa, vege-poulet général tao & crème glacée au thé vert) un régal. En plus, il s'agit généralement de petites à moyennes portions en ce qui concerne le buffet \"all you can eat\", ce qui permet d'en goûter plusieurs et de ne pas se sentir pleins. Je vous suggère fortement ce restaurant."}
{"text":"Ever-so barely 4 stars:  If one attempts their \"all-you-can-eat\" buffet option (my only selection thus far!), there are the virtues of endless vegetarian sushi of somewhat acceptable quality, alongside various vegetable side dishes of slightly-above-average quality.  The artificial meat substitutes are majorly distasteful for my palate but I can tolerate them; They are absolutely hard on my stomach. I do not deduct points in this regard due to it being my own subjective preference in the face of a vegetarian culture that majorly accepts such cuisine. The more-organic options of the buffet are my preference and are what I score the most heavily.  This is not for a palate that is absolutely refined; however, if one is hungry and desires great amounts of processed vegetable protein, then Yuan will be absolutely delightful.  I consider this one of the best vegetarian restaurants based on the quantity of food provided in their buffet option (I cannot speak for other specialty dishes) and the diversity in types of vegetarian foods offered. However, I would not consider it the absolute best in quality of food nor the best in interior design.   The ambiance is calming, serene yet very dated and nearly tacky in specific accessories. This can kill my desire to be in a place; However, they make up for it in the sheer spaciousness and openness of the restaurant. I have space to breathe, very fortunately.  The food, in all likelihood, is not fresh (some of it is likely frozen) nor particularly organic; However, in the honesty of the pricing and quantity they provide, such is overshadowed.  Again, I state, this is not for the palate that is refined but is for the one that wishes to simply experience a plethora of various vegetarian treats.   I would not eat here more than twice a month on the principle of health concerns regarding the heavily-processed nature of the vegetable proteins involved.  It absolutely should be noted the staff is particularly humble and concerned about the quality of your experience: You will be taken care of."}
{"text":"Very scrumptious!! dishes come in small size so you can try more different plates. The sushi imitation are awesome! so real and so yummy. Everything is more than I expected. I personally like the fried tofu, squid, shrimp and the Thai and general chicken, and more i just cannot remember the names lol if you are a vegetarian you should go try at least once! highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to a meal at Yuan for a while... However, with many good options on St Denis, I may not return.   While the concept of vegetarian bento boxes is interesting, the dishes were poorly executed. The 'brownie' was a slice of Betty Crocker cake from a box and the decor borrowed from an Italian restaurant... I'm confused - what is this place? Japanese? Mediterranean?   The only thing that had any taste was the General Tso 'beef which was quite good. Everything else was bland, cold and disappointing."}
{"text":"Asian vegans heaven (Though I don't believe in heavens). Usually come for the buffets. Love everything here, the flavour is very Taiwanese which is totally fine. The buffet portions are tiny which is great for figuring out items you like and items you don't. Very worth it meal for $20 since vegan meat is usually very expensive. My favourite items are the peanut butter dumplings. Why? Because it's extremely rare to find good dumplings with faux-meat vegetarian fillings. Other places usually just give up and put tofu and miscellaneous vegetables in a blender. But these are exactly like real dumplings. As for main dishes, my favourites are the sesame beef and the crispy duck. The sass me beef is amazing because it feels like real meat but obviously without the guilt. And the beef inside is just incredibly tender. As for the duck, oh man is it ever crispy. My last goto item would be the California sushi which has avocados and shrimp in it. Why do I love it? Because it's pretty much the only chance I get at having good sushi as a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Excellente nourriture ! Il faut bien entendu aimer les fausses viandes et la friture. Le Végé-Poulet Général Tao est excellent, les Végé-Fruits De Mer Sel & Poivre Aussi et je peux aussi rajouter La Soupe Won-Ton et les brocolis chinois ! Pour 20$/ch le \"All You Can Eat\" est parfait pour manger à plusieurs et partager ! Le service n'est pas toujours au top et les salles de bain au besoins de rénovations mais ça vaut définitivement le détour !"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there this week. We have both been vegetarian for several years and we are now vegan, so finding good food options when eating out can be a challenge. So happy we found this place, the ambiance is great, the food is fantastic, the staff was good but not very social. Our favourite dish was the sesame faux beef. I can't wait to go again to try new dishes."}
{"text":"First you see a big variety of vegan \"meat\" in the menu. Second, you order it. Finally, you eat and realize that they all taste the same, with the same sauces  (everything is sweet). The best was the vegan sushi and that's it."}
{"text":"Best vegan food ever -- and much less pretentious than ChuChai.  Super friendly staff, nice clean semi-sous-sol location.  Slightly cheezey decor and music.  I was going to dock them a star for not being licenced, but I don't think Buddhists drink, so I'll let it go this time.    Everyone raves about this General Tao's Tofu, but I thought the Gen. Tao's Chick'n was far better."}
{"text":"Right off the bet: if you are looking for 'authentic' but vegetarian options, this is not the right place for you. You can see it looking at the menu too. Similarly, if you are coming because you are into 'healthy eating' and not want anything fried or covered with sauce, this is not the right place for you.  Having said all that, food is not bad. Given that most of it are North American and vegetarian takes on a Pan-asian array of dishes and ingredients... Stay away from peanut sauce dumplings; it's really not good. A lot of fried food, but hey, it tastes nice. What surprised me was their mock meat; I actually quite enjoyed it, especially their mock beef was very good. I find that they cook eggplant really nice. Singapore noodles are very bad--the batch we received was not only cold but also had pretty much no taste... Not a place I would take any Chinese or Japanese friend to eat, but if you are not feeling like meat or a vegetarian and want to consume some good mock meat, this place has got you covered."}
{"text":"mmmm choose the all you can eat option. What a great value only almost 18$ on a weekday for all you can eat. The only criticism is some of the sauces are too yucky sugary sweet.Nice people. The floors and bathroom could be cleaner."}
{"text":"The worst possible experience ever.  Came with my wife and 18 month old infant for lunch on the recommendation of our Hotel Concierge.  The 1 star is for the good tasting food. BUT Never in my world wide travels have I come across a server who is so rude and nasty. She literally snatched the chop sticks from my infants hand.   Stay away people!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here by accident and left super happy!  The food is wonderful quality. Great variety!  The dim sum was especially impressive  made with care and thought.  interesting veggie meat options.  please try it! A great place to go with vegan or vegetarian friends to enjoy a feast"}
{"text":"Had an awesome meal there! We got the All You Can Eat Menu, which was $18 a person, and we went wild trying different dishes. The vegan duck was great, as was the Imperial Chicken, and the Ravioli With Peanut Sauce. We also got several kinds of vegan sushi, which is a real treat for me! The shrimp maki, the eel maki and the kamikazi roll were all great, and seriously, I never get to eat vegan sushi like this, even in Los Angeles.  On the All You Can Eat menu, everything is vegan, except for about 3 or 4 dishes that are clearly labeled as not vegan.  Also, feel free to really go wild and order a bunch of different dishes. The portion sizes are small, so you can try out many different things. I think my husband and I had about 4 different sushi rolls and maybe 5 different entree dishes, plus rice. But be sure and pace yourself.... according to the menu, they will charge you for all uneaten food!!! :-D So, only order what you can eat and clean your plate!!! :-D :-D  This would be a great place to impress your vegan / vegetarian date or to go with a group of friends, so you can taste a ton of different food."}
{"text":"Really wonderful price for all you can eat vegetarian (most of it is vegan, but a few items on the menu are indicated to let you know that it contains traces of animal by-products). Even my boyfriend, who isn't vegan, loved it! The sesame fake beef is wonderful and a must try, and I cannot begin to explain how amazing the fried taro balls are. Service has always been consistant for the past 2 years, so there's nothing to complain about!  :)"}
{"text":"I am really surprised that there are not more reviews for this great restaurant.  I am not a vegetarian by any means, but my dining partner is, so we had to give this place a try.  The location is half restaurant and half grocery store, specializing in Asian grocery and their homemade protein replacement concoctions.  Faux meat is something that I have never tried before, and it is their specialty here at Yuan.  Most dishes are offered as Chinese meals, as sushi, or in bento box form.  We both got bubble tea, because that is hard to pass up whenever available.  It comes shaken, not blended and most flavor are of the milk tea variety.  The sampler platter is what I ordered to try a little bit of everything.  I loved all of the items: -Fried Taro Roll- I am a huge fan of anything taro, so this was a treat for me.  Crispy on the outside and the inside filled with smooth potato-like taro. -Faux Duck- This was like little mini crispy duck legs, brushed with five spice honey and formed onto a wood skewer.  Tasted even better than the real thing to me because it still had all of the flavor, but less fat. -Faux Fried Chicken- this was fried sesame flavored nuggets of faux chicken, which was so close to the real thing, I do not know how anyone could tell the difference.  They also have a General Tso's Faux Chicken entrée- this dish made me want to give that a try. -Mixed Rolls- 4 pieces  of mixed sushi rolls with fried stuff and veggies on the inside.  I don't know what it was, but it sure tasted good.    My vegetarian friend ordered a sushi roll sampler that also included inari.  I tried some of her rolls and they were all very flavorful with great texture.  After eating at Yuan, you feel satisfied, but not gross or lethargic like after you eat meat.  We will definitely be coming back here next time we visit Montreal."}
{"text":"We have been here for many times. Definitely one of the best vegetarian restaurant in Montreal!! They also sell some ready-made vegetarian food in their store as well. It really makes us easier being a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Excellent, nous nous sommes régalés. Le seul bémol, aucun des serveurs(euses) ne parlaient français, nous sommes pourtant dans le quartier latin!?!"}
{"text":"How have I never reviewed Yuan before? This is a place I dream about. I visit Montreal a lot, and I ALWAYS go to Yuan. I get the all you can eat taste menu. It's such a fabulous deal, and the food is amazing. The avocado sushi? Amazing. The Imperial \"Chicken\"? Amazing. The vegetable tempura? Amazing. The Japanese Tofu? Amazing. I could go on and on and on. Come with a group, and you won't be disappointed.   Just FYI-- there is no alcohol there and it is not BYOB, and the only dessert is ice cream. But don't come here for that. Come for the amazing vegetarian food. And then come back again :)"}
{"text":"J'étais en route vers le Commensal pour rejoindre mon papa lorsque j'ai croisé le Yuan Vegetarien. C'est drôle, je travaille tout près depuis des années et je ne l'ai jamais vu. Tentons donc le coup et cancellons le buffet.  En tant que non vegetaliens (vegan) la fausse viande ne nous a guère attiré. Si j'y allais avec quelqu'un qui est prêt a se lancer, j'y goûterais probablement, avoir lu les excellents avis donnés sur la qualité de celles-ci.   Nous avons donc opté pour une soupe miso & une soupe wonton. (quand même une bonne portion pour une entrée) Ensuite, j'ai pris un riz brun frit au légumes et le paternel a opté pour le nid de nouilles croustillantes avec légumes et tofu frit. Nous avons été bien satisfaits. J'ai même ramené la moitié de mon plat.  ++ : la déco ! Les murs en brique dans un demi sous-sol, cet endroit a du potentiel. La boutique de produits vegan, le menu all-you-can-eat, les prix, la situation géographique (entre le metro sherbrooke et berri uqam sur st-denis) Service rapide  -bof : c'est quand même pas mal 'asian-kitch' avec les gros bols bleus, les nappes bourgogne a la ' grand restaurant ' et surtout l'affreuse musique de salon de massage."}
{"text":"Try the pumpkin curry - something unique and interesting you don't get to try every day!"}
{"text":"This review is for the all you can eat dinner.  We ordered:  :  eel hand roll (excellent) futomaki handroll (really good) imperial hand roll (really good) zen hand roll (good) chicken/mushroom brochettes (really good) thai chicken salad (really good) tofu teriyaki (really good) pan-fried dumplings (really good) veggie ham with black pepper sauce (good) chinese broccoli (okay) stir fried veggies (okay) sweet taro ball (okay) pineapple chicken (okay) deep fried banana (okay) green tea ice cream (good)  Service was gracious and fairly quick, though it slowed down as it got busier.  The veggie dishes were good but nothing that we could not get elsewhere.  We only ordered to balance out our meal with some greens.   The sushi was amazing especially the eel ... tasted like the real thing.  We would definitely return for the all you can eat dinner."}
{"text":"I had the all-you-can-eat buffet so that I can try different things. Overall I found a lot of the dishes to have a cheap feel to it. Most of the food didn't feel fresh. The staff here were extremely friendly though!"}
{"text":"We have been travelling to Montreal every year for the past 16 years and this is one of our go to vegan restaurants for as long as I can remember it being open. The food is really good, consistent, and reasonable priced. We always go with the buffet which isn't a real buffet so don't be turned off by that idea. You check off what you want from a sheet of paper and they make it to order, as much as you want for a fixed price. Not five stars because the service is really not very good, and there is no alcohol. But a must try for vegan travellers!"}
{"text":"Went there twice and each time got their all-you-can-eat buffet. First time was amazing, we tried various plates they were all delicious. Only issue was that our friend couldn't eat gluten, so unfortunately she couldn't try as many dishes (even if they had told her otherwise on the phone). This was a big disappointment for her. Nonetheless, I had liked my experience so I came back again with my boyfriend. I recommend to go there as a bigger group so you can share the meals, otherwise you can quickly get full with 2-3 plates. Sushi are good, noodles, general tao... but watch what you order, because my boyfriend and I had ordered too much of the same type of dishes (they were all fried) and we got sick of it, so make sure to ask the server what's fried and what's not - just something we'll remember for next time. Because of this reason my boyfriend would give a 3-star to this restaurant, but I know they have great food and that unfortunately he didn't get to try enough variety so for me it remains a 4. Service is slow and they often 'forget' what you have ordered on the menu, so take pictures of your order if you want."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I first fell in love with this place over a decade ago when it was at 400 Sherbrooke St. East.  Then it closed down and I searched for it online but to no avail, so I concluded that it was gone for good.  It was only recently that I discovered that it in fact reopened at 2115 St. Denis many years ago.  I lamented the thought of all those years I could have dined at Yuan (sigh).    Anyway, so I was super excited to eat at Yuan again on my recent trip to Montreal.  It was freezing outside and it was a 30 minute walk from our hotel, but I figured it would be all worth it (and my husband, who is a carnivore through and through, agreed to give it a try).  So we get there and we totally wanted the \"all you can eat\" lunch but were told that they stopped offering that recently and the \"all you can eat\" is only offered at dinner.  Major disappointment :(  Ok, so we got the bento box lunch ($16.95 each).  We both got the General Tao \"chicken\" (a.k.a. soy chunks) as our main because we love General Tao anything.  My husband (the sweetie that he is) ordered different sides from me so I could sample more items.    You get a starter soup with your bento box.  I got the Hot and Sour soup and my husband got the Miso soup.  Both soups were warm at best, more like tepid.  I like my soups really hot, so I was like sad face :(  However, the Hot and Sour soup was full of mushrooms, tofu and bamboo shoots.  The broth was really thick and it was full of flavour.  I finished the bowl, but it would have been so much more awesome if it was actually hot in temperature.  My husband's Miso soup was a  total dud.  It was mostly broth (no chunks of tofu) with some sorry pieces of nori seaweed on top (not wakame seaweed, but nori, like the seaweed they use to wrap sushi - weird to have this in soup in my opinion).  There were also some tiny slivers of celery in the soup, but it was mostly broth and too salty at that.  My husband only had a spoonful.  I ate the nori and about a spoonful of broth as well.   The General Tao \"chicken\" was good, but there's no fooling anyone that it's not textured vegetable protein (TVP).  It is so obviously TVP.  I like TVP, so no big deal, but my husband the meat lover was not too impressed.  The TVP pieces were nice and chewy and the sauce was sweet and tangy.  However, I've had better General Tao TVP.  You can choose between sushi or dumplings as a side, so I had the sushi and my husband had the dumplings (although he gave them all to me and didn't eat any of them).  The sushi was 4 pieces of maki with cucumber, avocado, some other vegetables and vegetarian \"shrimp.\"  The vegetarian \"shrimp\" tasted like really dense and solid surimi crab (a.k.a. fake crab sticks).  The maki contained a sweet white sauce in it that was a little too sweet, but I still liked it.  My husband had a piece and he actually liked it too.  The dumplings were boiled wonton filled with what looked and tasted like ground up water chestnuts, carrots and some other vegetables.  The filling was somewhat skimpy though.  The dumplings were covered in a sweet peanut sauce (like Hunan dumplings).  The dumplings would have been really good if the filling to wonton wrapper ratio was higher.   My husband also got steamed edamame in the pods with his dumplings.  He hates edamame so I got to eat all of them.  They were nicely steamed and lightly sprinkled with salt.  The bento boxes also came with steamed broccoli which were steamed al dente (perfect).  We also got rice which was nutty and delicious.  They called it brown rice, but it was not typical brown rice, it was much darker, I think it was red cargo rice.  We both loved the rice.  We also got a small salad (mixed greens) with some TVP slices on top which was also good.    For dessert we got 4 small pieces of glutinous rice cake with a red bean and mung bean centre.  It tasted like mochi and was chewy and delicious.    The restaurant is in a basement and it was very cold down there.  We sat next to the baseboard heaters but I was still cold.  The washrooms were also very cold and there was no hot water and the hand dryers blew only cold air.  There was a broken faucet in the women's washroom and it was covered with a plastic bag to indicate that it wasn't working.  The server was really polite and attentive.  I had no problems with service.    When Yuan was on Sherbrooke East it was a beautiful restaurant with the most delicious food.  I was sad to see what it has become.  The food was ok, but I was expecting the same experiences I had over 10 years ago.  Maybe I am just looking back at my memories through rose-tinted glasses.  Maybe they didn't have their \"A\" Team in the kitchen that day.  Maybe my tastes have changed.  I don't know.    I want to go back and give them another chance.  Maybe for their \"all you can eat\" dinner."}
{"text":"I can't really understand how this place actually has pretty good reviews and has been open for 10 years.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that for a vegetarian restaurant.... 90% of the menu was vegan. But other than that, it all went downhill from there and there were only disappointments.  This seemed like a cheap (vegan) buffet. The kind of buffet that you regret eating at and feel totally disgusting with afterwards. Not that I remember that feeling very well, nor do I want to, but it does remind me of how gross I would feel after eating at some fast food resto 10 plus years ago.   There just had to have been a ton of MSG in that food!  We were a party of 3 and decided to try their all-you-can-eat tasting menu so that we can share a bunch of different dishes (tapas style little dishes served to your table).   Everything kind of tasted the same and everything was kind of mild. The sauces were mostly very starchy and bland. Everything seemed to have a whole bunch of filler in them.  It was nice to know that the sushi rolls could have been made with a rice wrapper. But too bad they were mostly rice with a tiny piece of something inside. (the rice was so sweet that there must have been a ton ton ton of sugar in it!)  Even the raviolis with peanut sauce weren't good, how could you mess up a peanut sauce? The curry was mild and boring. We tried almost everything on the menu, 20+ dishes and they were all one disappointment after another.   Also, all the mock meats were totally tasteless. They looked pretty, but completely had no flavor. (I kind of realized that mock meat is not my thing either- why would I want it to look like a shrimp or piece of duck? Gross.)  This simple red rice was actually tasty. And the fresh spring rolls were pretty good, but bring your own sauce."}
{"text":"The ambiance is more like the one you'd expect in a cafeteria. Service seems to be in English only, even if you'd expect to have a French service given the location.   Food is good but not amazing. Nice deco but the presence of ants next to the windows is a bit annoying.  This place could be so much more with a little bit of care.  You can't buy alcohol, you cannot bring your own alcohol, be prepared to drink water.  Finally, we went to the washrooms after the dinner and discovered that is was very dirty, I cannot even guess when was the last time someone cleaned it up.  So, it was our first and last visit to this place."}
{"text":"J'aime toujours revenir ici goûter quelques plats asiatique adaptés sans viande et prendre mon temps. Vous pouvez commander à la carte ou prendre le menu buffet à volonté qui est servi à la façon des tapas. L'aubergine general tao du buffet est un incontournable en passant. Leur spécialité sont les tofus aromatisés aux saveurs de poulet, boeuf, canard et crevette. Je vous laisse découvrir, moi ça me plait à chaque fois. La place est cute et peut recevoir des groupes à la même table. Le service est correcte et rapide, mais ne vous attendez pas à jaser ici et là avec les serveuses, elles sont beaucoup trop occupés. J'ai toujours l'impression qu'il en manque une tellement elle court. Ils ont un bar et la facture est abordable. J'y reviens quelques fois à chaque année pour le plaisir des saveurs."}
{"text":"a have to try out place. excellent food for a correct price. great choice of dishes, the wonton is delicious and the fried mushroom main-course as well."}
{"text":"This was so surprisingly good -- and fast (we were in a rush). Friendly servers. Incredibly healthy yet tasty food. Reasonably priced. Both of us recommend the Buddha delight; only $15, but a perfect blend of stirfry tofu, veggies and rice. Yum."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Yuan for 6-7 years at least. It's a great option for the vegans and veggies because the majority of their menu is animal free. However a lot of their sauces are the same - sweet and sticky. After my last visit, I don't think I would go back. They need to have varied tastes in the ingredients and menu. I would give it a 3.5 if Yelp would allow it :)"}
{"text":"A week ago, I would have given this place 5 stars.  I've been here dozens and dozens of times since 2006 and have seen them evolve from a sit-on-the-floor traditional Chinese restaurant to the present classier feel the restaurant has with lemon water, green tea, and a calm, pleasant atmosphere.  The veggie eel is to die for, and their buffet is amazing.  Two years ago I would say that their service depended on who was working and was occasionally spotty.  Today the service is great every single time I go.  Everything on the menu is vegan save for a couple of items that contain dairy.  I went a couple of days ago and ordered the veggie eel as part of the table d'hote, which I've ordered numerous times.  On the menu, it says that they give you a dessert at the end of the table d'hote meals.  Usually this is a modest plate of fruit.  This time it was ice cream.  I am vegan, and I'd asked servers here many times if an item was vegan through the years, just to make sure (and was always met with a reaction of polite laughter and affirmation that nearly every item was vegan).  I naively decided not to ask whether the ice cream was vegan.  Why would a vegan restaurant serve me dairy as part of my vegan meal?  I took a bite and it tasted odd - not unlike vegan ice cream, but I could taste a hint of dairy.  I asked the server if it was vegan and she said it was not.  I do not understand why she would offer me a non-vegan dessert when 99% of items are vegan and I have been there countless times.  She did not apologize and I left feeling disappointed with the staff.  I don't want to be petty, but a place will always lose points for me if they give me a non-vegan item when the item is just marked as \"dessert\" on the menu.  Especially when it's at a vegan restaurant.  Note:  I went there again after this experience and explained the situation to the manager.  He apologized profusely, and there is now a vegan item - a rice cake - as an option for the dessert."}
{"text":"This place had been on our list for a long time now and we finally decided to go on a cozy saturday afternoon.  My boyfriend who has been a vegetarian for 10 years was really eager to try this place out since he does not have to scrutinize the menu at all before ordering. So we got: - Tom yum soup: was pretty good, not too sweet nor too sour and the mock schrimp was pretty nice! - Smoked mock (duck?) drumsticks: texture wise, it was very resembling to chicken! But it lacked a little spice here and there - Mock General Tso chicken and mock sesame beef: Both had overly sweet sauces, very resembling in dishes texture and taste. The mock chicken/beef are deeply fried in dough and are both very soft  in texture (almost like melted cheese). A few bites was enough. - Singapore vermicelli: Lacking in taste  The portions were adequate but to us, but the dishes pretty much tasted like what you would find in a food court."}
{"text":"They have a dim-sum buffet menu, but we ordered the Japanese eggplant/tofu and crispy peppered beef with sesame and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"After having mock meat meals at a number of restaurants across the world, this place ranks up there. A group of 4 can eat every item from the buffet menu.  Go hungry, drink lots of water. The sodium content does catch up with you.  Closed off the meal with some red bean ice cream.  Will be back here next time to finish the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"First time going to a vegetarian buffet, and I must say that I am really impressed. Their mock meat is incredibly \"real\", both judging from the look and the taste. The duck, the fish, and the general tao were my favorite. The fried taro and pumpkin balls were super tasty.   There is a large variety of food to choose from, mainly mock meat dishes, tofu dishes, eggplant dishes, and sushi. The sushi were so so, nothing too special. After trying everything on the menu, it can get a bit repetitive, since the main ingredients are pretty much the same. But, at least they have different flavors and kind of mock meat.  I think the price is fair and it is worth trying. I'm sure you'll be impressed by their mock meat and eveb doubt if it is just not actually real meat."}
{"text":"They do an excellent imitation of meat/fish items. Tastes almost like real meat/fish. For someone like me who relatively new to veganism - this is very helpful. The prices are quite reasonable too - given that most vegan places are usually significantly costlier."}
{"text":"Great place for both vegans and omnivores to get their Asian food fix. Offers Taiwanese style vegan dishes, containing various mock meats and fishes. The menu is similar to that of a standard ayce sushi restaurant: a good variety of rolls and nigiri, as well as all your standard \"Chinese food\" classics, such as spring rolls, dumplings,  general tao,  beef and broccoli, and of course tempura, udon, and much more. The ayce option is very affordable and the portions are small, so you can try many things.  Note that the mock meats are mainly seitan based, so not gluten free friendly. But personally I adore seitan, it has meaty and delicious texture and is appreciated by many omnivores. There is a lack of veggies on the menu which is disappointing- very heavy on fried and saucy food, which makes for a sugar and fat laden meal (who said vegan food was healthy?), though tasty nonetheless.  Favorites were the fried tofu, taro and pumpkin balls, mock duck, and bbq eel. The fresh spring rolls and peanut sauce were also very good. The salmon and inari sushi were also enjoyable. I didn't like the tuna avocado gunkan (it was canned mayo tuna style, not like the actual fresh fish), or the fact they had red pepper in some sushis which tasted odd. The salt and pepper seafood was way too salty. The lemon fish had a slightly odd aftertaste. The sushi pizza is mostly just a fried rice patty with tasteless toppings. But overall, it was a pretty yummy meal, and food was hot and fresh.  The waitstaff were very nice and attentive and the restaurant was very clean with a nice atmosphere. Also, they will allow some members of your table to order a la carte while others do ayce,  but obviously no sharing."}
{"text":"Wavering between a 2 and 3 star rating.   The good:  The service is friendly and quick. There are a ton of options which makes for a fun experience, especially if you're vegan and used to having limited choices. The portions are small enough that you can try quite a few of them, but large enough to be satisfying so that you don't need to reorder the same thing twice. The lemon faux-fish is delicious and one of the few options on the menu that is truly different. I can't say I have eaten anything similar at another restaurant. Other stand-outs include the pumpkin balls and the veggie ham. They also serve sushi.  The not-so-good: Unfortunately, the vast majority of the food is mediocre. I have been here a couple of times and have tried nearly everything on the menu, so I feel I can provide a pretty comprehensive review. Most of the dishes are variations on the same theme with slightly different (overly sweet) sauces. The faux-chicken is good for the first bite, but tastes the same in every dish it's in (which is a lot of them). Most of the dishes came out luke warm, with only one as hot as food is normally served. Salads are almost exclusively iceberg lettuce with a bit of whatever else thrown on top (like faux-chicken or tuna). The vegan brownies taste identical to chocolate cake mix. Generally, the food is reminiscent of your average cheap Chinese restaurant, with the only difference being that everything is vegetarian.   A caveat: I rarely eat at buffets, and many of the people I came here with were impressed, so it's possible that I set my standards too high for this type of experience. You can't expect fine dining for $22 all-you-can-eat. As long as you know what you're getting into, this could still be a fun destination for a group of people.   The \"too long; didn't read\" version: Quantity over quality."}
{"text":"Oh man, just got back from Yuan and I can hardly walk.   I \"found\" Yuan while walking around my school one day and thought it'd be cool to try, seeing as I'm a vegetarian. It's actually a vegan (minus the sushi) restaurant, with an all-you-can-eat buffet at very reasonable prices. For lunch, it's $12.99. The waitress was super friendly, always wishing us \"bon appétit!\" and making sure we had enough food and tea. The sushi is fantastic! Not too much selection, but all the ones we tried were delicious and so fresh (California, Kamikaze, Spicy Salmon and Avocado). We were a party of 5, so we were able to try many different dishes. I won't go naming all of them, because we ate A LOT but honourable mentions go to the miso soup, peanut butter dumplings, imperial rolls (SO fresh and crispy), pineapple \"steak\" and the fried tofu. The buffet menu spans only one page, but when the food tastes that great, that's really all you need.  My only disappointment was that there was a lot of deep-fried at the table. We are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend is vegetarian thus time to time we try vegetarian restaurants and Yuan is, by far, the best one we have ever tried.  As a meat eater, sometimes I go through hard times with the available choices. Not the case with Yuan.  Although you can order à la carte, we always go for the AYCE buffet. The selection is great and some dishes you don't even notice you are eating no meat at all.  If you or your significant other is vegetarian this restaurant is a must visit."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! I can only speak about the all you can eat buffet, which for the price really is amazing. I have been to this restaurant about 6 times, i would say 80% of the dishes on the buffet menu are delicious! The sushi is super tasty and so are the asian dishes! Only downside is no alcohol!"}
{"text":"Rapport qualité/prix raisonnable, service efficace. J'ai été satisfaite mais pas impressionnée. Idéal pour un repas relax de semaine. La formule style buffet c'est agréable pour goûter à tout et partager en groupe."}
{"text":"Tofu,tofu and more tofu...ALL you can eat! This is not your standard go to the buffet and fill your plate, this is a sit -down and get served. The General Tao, sweet and sour chicken, is great as is the crispy tofu, 2 kinds of sushi, Thai salad,stir fried veggies, and battered eggplant. The green salad is somewhat odd tasting, the shrimp,duck, too salty, and the sweet and sour beef looked like fried spam and didn't taste much better. The hot and sour soup looked like some sort of weird jell-o, but tasted ok, not great.  Skip dessert, as the green tea ice cream is made with Carnation milk and is soooo ewwwwww!! Don't know if the vanilla is any better, ask for fresh fruit instead, and hope they have it.This place is good for groups,but service is slow. Decor is very zen,but the bathrooms need plumbing work and more attention to supplies. There is a surcharge for \"wasted\"food, so be careful not to over order."}
{"text":"J'ai beau relire les autres avis qui ont été écrits récemment, je suis toujours pas capable de comprendre l'expérience que j'ai vécu. Mon amie et moi nous sommes présentés un mardi soir pour profiter du menu Buffet, et ce fut ma pire expérience de All You Can Eat à date.  Le service fut tout simplement horrible. On aurait du sentir que quelque chose clochait quand ça a pris 20 minutes pour qu'un serveur daigne venir chercher notre feuille; j'étais rendu à tenir le menu bien en vue dans les airs pour qu'on puisse nous remarquer. Habituellement dans un AYCE, le service est rapide, les portions par assiettes sont petites, donc les assiettes sont sensées se succéder rapidement. Ça nous a pris presqu'une heure pour recevoir un samosa et 2 dumplings, une heure à regarder les tables arrivées bien après nous se faire servir et dévorer leurs plats. On était affamée, ça s'est terminé en moins de 30 secondes, et puis s'en suit une vingtaine de minutes pour recevoir l'assiette suivante, et ainsi de suite. La serveuse ne comprenait ni l'anglais ni le français, et garochait carrément les plats sur la table. Une assiette est même arrivée avec un morceaux de tofu général tao collé en dessous, et elle l'a juste laissé s'étamper sur la table! C'était insultant.  Niveau nourriture, comme quelques avis l'ont fait remarquer, overall j'ai trouvé ça trop frit et trop sucré. Et j'ai goûté du meilleur mock meat... Mais surement que ma vision de la cuisine a été influencée par le service horrible, on était déjà fâchée lorsqu'on a commencé à manger, ça a pas du aider. Il aurait fallu que la nourriture soit exceptionnelle pour compenser, et ce ne fut pas le cas.  On est parti lorsque notre première feuille fut terminée et on avait encore faim, en temps normal on aurait commandé un deuxième service, mais après 2h on en avait assez. Je sais pas si je vais leur redonner une deuxième chance, je vais l'avoir sur le coeur longtemps ce 20$ jeté dans le vide."}
{"text":"Delicious buddhist food! Just moved to Montreal from Toronto and needed a place to fill the role that Simon's Wok and King's Cafe played in my life there. Was not disappointed.  Awesome: - the crispy and spicy nuggets  Good: - the veggie duck imperial - the singapore style vermicelli - the smoked drumstick  Okay: - the fried imperial roll  And finally the wonton soup was kinda meh, but perhaps this was because much of it had spilled on the way. If you're ordering delivery or takeout avoid it!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I don't eat meat but I'd been having some cravings recently and a friend recommended this to me so I thought I would check it out. The imitation meat is delicious! My friends and I tried the broccoli with beef, duck and kung pao chicken and everyone thought everything was delicous! The texture is quite similar to real meat and the veggies were very fresh and crisp. I particularly liked the duck which was so well made it even had fake skin! My boyfriend hates eating at vegetarian places because he really likes meat but he ordered the curry chicken friend rice and even he was impressed by his meal! It's also super cheap! Their $10 lunch special gets you a soup, salad and main with rice! Craving satisfied!"}
{"text":"There aren't many Chinese vegetarian restaurants in Montreal so this all you can eat style place has been on my radar for a while. We went for Chinese New Year lunch, and we had a vegetarian friend. $17 for ayce lunch is not too bad, but you have to factor in the fact that there was nothing pricy on the menu. (Compared to ayce sushi) Sadly, the food was pretty disappointing. I could tell you about each dish, but we tried most of the items (party of 7). First off, they had none of the traditional Chinese vegetarian items, like the circular tofu skin thing, and the red sweet and sour mushy gluten, and the chewy brown cube thing. (I don't know what they're called in English ok) The faux meats could've done great, but why they gotta deep fry everything and drench it in the think sauce??!! Not to mention the thick sauce all tasted kinda similar. The pineapple sauce, sesame sauce, and general Tao sauce were all tangy with different undertones, thickened with plenty of cornstarch. They also had a sushi menu, but they were sub par as well. Too much sushi vinegar, poorly rolled.   So, if you insist to go, here are tips:  -don't get drinks! You have to pay more plus there are no refills -the pumpkin balls, braised tofu, and spring rolls are good. Get those."}
{"text":"A non-vegan and a vegan walks in a vegetarian restaurant (with 90% vegan menu)...  Okay, cliché story starting aside, this was not what I was expecting! I came in a bit skeptical because I am Chinese myself and I'm not too much of a fan of mock-meat, but I was extremely happy and satisfied.   We came here on a Saturday lunch time (12:15pm) and surprisingly, it was not busy, so we got seated right away. Since we wanted to have an idea of what they offered, we opted for the All You Can Eat menu option.   We were scared that the portions might be too big since we were only two, so we only got like 6 dishes, but they were perfect in terms of size to share for two!   We had won ton soup, peanut sauce dumplings, salt and pepper fried veggie-seafood, general tao eggplants, singapore noodles, basil tofu, kamikaze roll, and many others. Very yummy!  I highly recommend the basil tofu, and the peanut sauce dumplings!  Will come back!"}
{"text":"My first time yesterday at a vegetarian buffet!  Didn't think I would be overeating at this venue but I did.  It was a great experience.  Food was amazing as was the service!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian +vegan/All you can eat/Dinner/ $22 per person before tax   Came here on a Saturday night after recommendations from friends. This was the first time I've been to an all you can eat vegetarian restaurant but so glad I did! I've had vegetarian meat before so it wasn't too surprising. Don't expect it to taste like meat because it's not. I was surprised by the variety, they even had maki and curry. My favourites were the eel, duck, and tonkatsu (all vegetarian of course). We spent three hours eating and don't regret it. The portion size for the dishes were perfect for four people which allows you to try more food without overstuffing yourself. I ate A LOT but surprisingly didn't feel that uncomfortable want to throw up post AYCE feeling. I would definitely come back again. Fun fact, the owners are Taiwanese so you'll see a lot of Taiwanese tea on sale near the cash register. They also sell refrigerated vegetarian food in the front of you ever want to make it at home."}
{"text":"Very delicious food, beautifully presented.  Apparently there's a lunch buffet but we missed it.  The service was super friendly and the interior is nice.  The basil/eggplant dish was really good and there's a combo you can order so it comes with all this stuff plus sushi and dessert.  When I asked if the dessert was vegan the waitress said she'd talk to her manager, and when she came back out she said the manager will put together a vegan dessert especially for us.  A few minutes later there was this incredible vegan frozen treat that blew my mind."}
{"text":"If I lived in Montreal, I'd come here once a week at least.  It's hard to find 1. Vegetarian food that 2. Tastes delicious that is 3. Asian.   Yuan is awesome-it's 'buffet' or a la carte, the latter which is more like dim sum as in you check off which items you want to eat on the menu pages. I asked if I ordered too much food for one person, but the portions are small and just right so I got to try so many dishes.  The magic of soy. So amazing. Not cheap, but it's a nice place, delicious food, and friendly service that makes it worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm really a big fan of this place. I always got a good experience, and the ambiance is relaxing. I usually get the buffet menu which is a very good deal for vegan food."}
{"text":"Don't know why I don't see more folks here. Its a wonderful alternative restaurant.  We went ahead and ordered the all-you can eat menu, and went through at least 6-7 dishes each.   As other reviewers have noted, most are small-appetizer size, which is just fine for sampling.  The service was OK-could be better category."}
{"text":"This is a nice choice for vegetarians.  My wife eats a mainly vegetarian/pescatarian diet, and after a few days of seafood in New England I wanted to find a place in Montreal that better suited her dietary choices.  Yuan Vegetarien is located near the hotel we stayed in, so it was worth trying.    The restaurant is \"buffet\" style, but the difference is that you use a list to check off items you'd like to have, and they bring the dishes out to you a little at a time.  You can reorder as much as you want.  We got two orders, but big eaters will probably want to order more often.  The dishes are pretty small, which is good for pairs or groups of three who want to sample a wide variety of food.  For instance, the sushi is 4 pieces per order, the \"chicken\" and tofu dishes have roughly 6-8 pieces, and the noodles are about a 5-inch plateful.    Overall the food was really good.  My wife and I usually stay clear of vegetarian meats because of the potentially high sodium content, so we ordered all of the different tofu, mushroom, and vegetable dishes, the crispy and Singapore noodles, the spring rolls, and the futomaki and kamikaze sushi rolls.  Everything was prepared well, and not greasy (except maybe the Singapore noodles).  It took about 5 minutes for our first dish to arrive, and the rest steadily arrived every 3 minutes or so.    The service was quick and the staff was friendly.  We went on a Tuesday night, and it wasn't crowded.  The ambience of the restaurant isn't much to cheer about, but it's clean inside. The only drawback of the night was a pompous older man 4 tables away, who spoke really loudly about all of his lifelong accomplishments as a professor."}
{"text":"Lemme do a Carnac the Magnificent thing here...  1) Peace in the Middle East. 2) Johnson being in a vegan/vegetarian restaurant. 3) Canucks winning the Stanley Cup.  Answer: Things that will *NEVER* happen.  Point #2 was true until my visit to Yuan.  And I say this with a staunch and unblemished record of carnivorism.  As one of my 'laws' state, \"The more animals that had to die for your meal, the more delicious it is.\"  But seriously, I was feeling guilty that I dragged my vegetarian friend to watch me eat at aPdC the night before while she tried to enjoy her salad as I moaned in pleasure with my mouth full of dead animals and foie gras from tortured ducks.  So to atone, I figure we'll go to a vegetarian joint.  Good choice - because she said this was her personal aPdC.  This joint specializes in faux meat and this was quite interesting as I have a good idea of what they were up against.  It's $20 for all-you-can-eat dinner menu.  And for the most part, the food was good and was eerily similar to the 'real' thing.  Some highlights:  1) Japanese Eel - must order - the skin is simulated with seaweed and the tofu resembles the texture of unagi - it was spooky close to the real thing. 2) Curry pork - the curry is too watery and mild (even for katsu curry), but the 'pork' katsu was pretty close save the density 3) General Tso's Chicken - okay, I must admit this is first time I've ever had 'General Tso' chicken.  I'm Chinese and I'm from Vancouver - so no, I don't have a lot of exposure to faux-Cantonese items.  It's like 'spicy' & sour pork - so like Mark S. - I can also say this is the *best* existing General Tso chicken I've ever had.  I can scarcely believe I wasn't eating meat.  It was so crunchy and light - it's actually better than the the deep-fried pork/chicken nuggets typically used in Westernized Cantonese dishes (ya, I *said* it!).  It lacks that usual 'chew' you get at the end - but this is seriously good - vegetarian or not.  Those were my favourite dishes - and there were many more 'pretty good' vegetarian dishes including some pretty realistic sushi/sashimi.  Not all the dishes are realistic - but the ones three I listed: if you served them to me without telling me, I probably won't be able to tell it was meatless.  But let's not get too hung out on how 'realistic' it is - food was good, bar none.  Of course, I'm not going to go vegetarian anytime soon.  As one of my idols says, \"Vegetarians are doomed to a barren, joyless existence\" and my degenerate gambling idol lost a $1 million proposition bet on giving up meat for a year.  I'm not a rich man - but even for a $1 million - I don't think I can do it.  I would want to do it for the money (still a lot of money after paying for a personal world-class vegetarian chef) - but my body would breakdown without dead animal.  It's a physically impossible.  But when I meet omnivores with vegetarian significant others - I used to look at them with scorned pity.  But hey - now knowing joints like Yuan exist -- that's true love... or at they have at least $1+ million on the line."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out from this restaurant, and it was fantastic!  The ambience was great and the staffs were very friendly and helpful!  Their menu was filled with great food, very hard for us to pick and choose!  In the end we chose a curry fried rice and a BBQ beef with broccoli.  Both dishes were fantastic and the price was just right!  Not only does it have a sit-down area for dining, which looks wonderful and clean; there is also a small area where you can purchase vegetarian food ranging from soy products to fake meat.  Fantastic restaurant, would definitely recommend and return!"}
{"text":"Brought my two vegetarian friends, we thought the place was nice and the food was good but they took forever to take our orders and to bring the food. There was way to much noise and you could tell they were lacking staff. Maybe we went on a bad evening."}
{"text":"An oasis of vegetarian in  a very meat-oriented city (it seems to a newcomer).  We thoroughly enjoyed Yuan Vegetarian on a Sunday evening.   We went ahead and ordered the all-you can eat menu, and went through at least 6-7 dishes each.   As other reviewers have noted, most are small-appetizer size, which is just fine for sampling.  The service was OK-could be better category.  Dishes came out in generally even intervals, although the final dish I ordered ended up coming out as we were preparing to leave.  The one problem with the service, as that as we were concluding we couldn't get anybody's attention to get the check and pay.  I finally went up to the bar.  Chalk it up to a very busy waitress.    There were some big winners in the selections and some puzzling selections as well.  I ordered the basil-eggplant sauteed plate.  Wowser.  Great, substantial flavors, fresh, perfectly cooked eggplant.  Could have been a meal with some of their brown rice.  Their Singapore stir-fried noodle were very tasty and well-prepared, as were their dumplings and shu-mei.  My wife had a tofu dish that she was not crazy about--the only dish that we didn't finish off.  All in all, highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had some better food, we had some worse food. We did the all-you-can-eat option (if one person at the table gets it, everyone has to get it), and got smaller portions of several things. This seems like the way to go. We got much better variety than one would normally get. The General Tao's tofu was refreshing, usually (at least when I've had it) the tofu is dry and spongy, but Yuan's General Tao's was wet, and squishy. It literally melted in my mouth For me, that was an interesting and tasty take of it.  The tofu with a peanut sauce had the same tofu, but with chunks about twice as long. The soft tofu didn't have the same pizzaz as the General Tao's did, because since the chunks were bigger, there was less of a crunch, and more of a gush. It started to take away from the dish, rather than add to it. The best dish we got was the 'lemon vega-fish' It had an amazing fish-like feel and taste. It had a nice subtle lemon flavor that was neither overpowered nor lost. Consistency was the main problem. The tortellini and the dumplings were both too soggy. They both had great taste, but the dishes were ruined for me by the consistency. The tortellini almost fell apart as I picked it up. The service was a bit slow at times. After the main course was done, it seemed that the servers completely forgot about us for 15 or 20 minutes. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing, it gave us a little time to relax after a nice meal.  All in all, I'd revisit this place, and do the all-you-can-eat option, because of the great variety. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"When a restaurant decides to make faux meats, I was a little skeptical at first because of my past experiences with vegetarian meats at the grocery store. Surprisingly, the food in the restaurant was AMAZING and I love the atmosphere of this place. The owners were lovely people and they let me in on the cold month of March before the opening hours, they also gave me a Van Gogh book as a gift. It is definitely a 5* for me and I will come back with my friends in the future."}
{"text":"It is clear to me that the creators of Yuan Vegetarien dove into my dreams in an attempt to create my perfect restaurant. They got a few of the minor details wrong (the server should be Ricardo Montalbán, and the music should contain lyrics regarding whether the \"pink\" or \"green\" hypothesis is the best explanation for how perfect my girlfriend is), but they got all of the major parts correct.  They always (lunch or dinner) have a \"buffet\" menu available. It is $18-$20 and is set up where you tick selections off of a paper menu and then they freshly prepare small portions to bring out to you. The process repeats (with new paper menus) until you are about to enter a food coma, and then they offer you a fortune cookie. I have never been able to eat the fortune cookie. A highlight of the buffet menu is the General Tso's \"Chicken.\"  The buffet menu is a large subset of their full menu. The full menu includes a huge variety of both straightforward vegetable dishes (e.g., Ginger and Basil Eggplant) and fake meat dishes (e.g., Pepper \"Steak\" and various \"Seafood\" Sushi). A highlight of the full menu is the General Tso's \"Chicken.\"  For lunch, they have available a small selection of Lunch Specials for under $10. This price includes extras like soup and fruit. Depending on the dish, it might come served in a colorful Bento Box with even more extras like crispy sesame seed something-or-others. A highlight of the Lunch Specials menu is the General Tso's \"Chicken.\"  The quality of the food varies from \"Excellent\" to \"OMG what deal with Lucifer did you strike such that you are able to prepare this perfection on Earth you Faustian restauranteurs?\" The fake meat dishes sometimes are delicious without being realistic (e.g., Orange \"Beef\"), and sometimes are delicious and are realistic (e.g., Pepper \"Steak\"). Yuan Vegetarien's awesomeness is increased by having a freezer section up front where you can purchase their wide range of meat replacers for use in your own cooking.  Before I end my review, I would like to specially highlight the General Tso's \"Chicken,\" just in case I have overlooked mentioning it in this review. It is the second best General Tso's Chicken I have ever had in my life, and I am including all of the dishes I had *prior* to becoming a vegetarian. The only better preparation I have had was over a decade ago at the Princess Hotel in Israel. However, a quick internet search has revealed to me that the Chinese Restaurant at that hotel is now a French Restaurant, clearing the way for Yuan's dish to hold the current \"World's Best\" title."}
{"text":"It's an incredible buffet. The sushi and meals are freshly prepared. It's delicious with a variety of very healthy food with a few deep fried dishes. The dessert are included. Zen, clean and friendly. Most the meals are vegan with a few vegetarian.  They open at 5pm but sometimes at 7pm the restaurant is full so you might want be there early or make reservations!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian achievement unlocked: this was my first time having faux meat internationally. Since it was the eve of my birthday, my boyfriend and sister treated me to a nice veggie meal. And I have to say, I was pretty impressed.  We wanted some variety, so we decided to get a couple of appetizers and entrees and split everything. We got the salmon sashimi salad and the salt and pepper fried shrimp to start. The salad came out beautifully presented, I was shocked how similar the \"salmon\" was in color and texture to the real thing. However, it tasted sweet which kind of threw me off, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. As far as appetizers go, the salt and pepper shrimp was the star! If I didn't live hundreds of miles away I'd be back weekly for that dish alone. The breading was crisp and wonderfully seasoned, and the texture of the faux shrimp was very similar to the real thing. I highly recommend this dish!  For our entrees we split the curry chicken and lemon pepper steak. My favorite was by far the pepper steak, although the taste and texture did not bear any resemblance to real steak I thoroughly enjoyed it. The sauce was a nice balance of bitter and sweet, the \"steak\" was breaded with a crunchy outside and a yummy chewy inside. Nom.   The ambiance was nice, a little mismatched but overall not bad. The service was slow, which is what we observed in every place we sat down to eat in Canada, so it might be the norm. We thought they were going to rush us out since we arrived 45 mins before closing time, but it took a good 10 mins after we were seated for someone to take our order. We're from NJ so we're used to things being very fast paced, and I guess it was a bit of a culture shock. Thankfully the food was well worth the wait, so no harm, no foul.  First international vegetarian restaurant experience was a success! If I ever return to Montreal I will be sure to visit Yuan."}
{"text":"The food looked and smelled great; unfortunately, I wasn't able to taste any. Why? I'm glad you asked.  I arrived at 9 on a Sunday night. The place was only open until 10, but the server grudgingly sat the large party in front of me. She explained that I would have to wait. I noticed that every table in the dining room was occupied or needed to be bused, which should have been my first clue. I only saw two people working: the server who was clearly exhausted and someone behind the cash register taking care of a dozen diners that wanted separate checks and to pay with individual debit cards. I shouldn't wonder that the server was exhausted.  At Yuan Végétarien, diners  fill out a slip for each round of food, like ordering dim sum, which seems like a really labor-intensive proposition for one server.  Also, it had been 28°C and really humid that day, and the dining room was not air conditioned and was as hot and damp as a fireman's boxers.  I shudder to think what the kitchen must have been like. I felt sorry for the server but not so sorry that I didn't notice her numerous empty-handed trips into the kitchen.  Maybe she figured it wasn't her job to bus tables and was waiting for the guy trapped behind the cash register to do it.   It was like the scene from \"Mildred Pierce\" when Joan Crawford scolds a waitress never to go into the kitchen empty handed.  I figured I had nothing to gain from that.    After about 20 minutes of watching the server wander back and forth in a daze and apologetic nods from the guy behind the cash register, it was obvious that they were making no headway toward clearing a table and that I would not be able to eat at Yuan Végétarien that night because of the way the place works.  I would have appreciated some candor from them about that instead of letting me connect the dots on my own.  It turns out that I did have a really lovely dinner--elsewhere."}
{"text":"Horrible service. The waitress forgot half of our sushi order which I think ended up on the table next to us because they sent it back and I heard them tell the waitress that they didn't order that. Then the waitress kept asking us if we still wanted the dishes that we had marked on our sheet. We kept answering yes, and after one dish she would ask us again for the next one. Food is ok, nothing crazy. All the sauces on the veggie chicken taste the same. A little sweet for my taste. If I want that kind of food, I'd rather pay more and go to Chu Chai. Too bad!"}
{"text":"Love it here. I ate here three times, all were great dining experiences. This is not a standard buffet where you go and take food from a display. The waitresses come to your table and ask you to select from a long list of Vegan dishes (Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Thai, Vietnamese and Szechuan style). The dishes are small portions but you can select as many dishes as you like. Really original tastes. I would recommend this experience."}
{"text":"Yuan is definitely my favourite vegetarian restaurant in Montreal. Whether you pick the regular menu or the buffet (delicious!) the food is tasty, chewy and fulling. Even my partner who is a meat-eater was greatly impressed by the faux-seafood which tasted like real shrimp and salmon! The chicken and beef are succulent as well. Other than the food, the staff is friendly and the place is big enough that you feel comfortable. Thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"I went to this place twice. Once they were on Sherbrooke, this Friday for second time.  They change lots of style food.  Regard fake meat, they use soya products.  The owner is Taiwanese.  The do keep traditional Chinese or Asian vegetarian food.  They also add lots of vegan style food in their manu.  Soon, they will have wedding part there.  They will prepare for traditional south-east Asia vegetarian food for the parents but they will prepare mostly vegan style veggies.  Hope this will help people who eats veggies."}
{"text":"My first time at Yuan, was okay. As a vegan, I have no weird complaints about how the food did not taste like \"real meat\" (if my food tasted like suffering, I would be disappointed.) Nor did they try and feed me real-person-cream (although in all fairness, they are called a vegetarian restaurant, not vegan).  I was lucky enough to try Yuan's buffet. This is a pretty cool system, as you can just tick off all of the things you would like to try, and they deliver it to you fresh, as opposed to trying to keep it hot in metal bins under fluorescent light.  We had the hot and sour soup, veggie shrimp, general tsao's, curried steak, dumplings, etc; as well as some sushi selections. .My one complaint about the buffet is that I didn't see a whole lot of green items on the menu; lots of glutens coated in sugar or deep dried. There was even this pretty revolting deep fried sushi pizza thing that makes me not want to have tempura again for a year. I've been informed by Seb, that on the regular menu, there are often vegetables that come on the plate with the menu selections. I just wish there had been some greener selections to choose from. I think that really I am just kinda spoiled in Calgary; even my vegan pals from Montreal and the surrounding area are jealous of our vegan chinese food fare.  The veggie shrimp were lovely, but I felt like I was going to choke on the salted batter at times. I had waaaay better general tsao's tofu at a little place in Chinatown than Yuan's chicken could compare. The dumplings were great.  I would definitely try this place again; next time with a larger group of people maybe, or from the normal menu!"}
{"text":"I have been going on and off to this restaurant for the last five year. I always get the all you can eat menu, it is very affordable and you get to sample a lot of different items. Some of my favorite items on the menue are Japanese fried tofu, the lemongrass Fish, Ginger tofu and sushi. The food is tasty but the super healthy, it is not a place you would eat at everyday."}
{"text":"Worst taste. I have been to Hong-Kong and Taiwan try the vegetables dishes, this is the worst one. All the dish with chicken taste like mold deep fried tofu. The first time the last time."}
{"text":"Je ressors toujours de chez Yuan avec un avis mitigé. D'un côté, les prix sont raisonnables. On parle de 22$ pour un buffet à volonté en fin de semaine (ou 20$ en semaine). Aussi, le restaurant, situé en demi-sous-sol, est assez vaste et on ne s'y sent pas serré. Il y a assez de places pour contenir à la fois des petits que des grands groupes. Le menu est impressionnant et comprend quelques soupes, près d'un vingtaine d'entrées (dont des rouleaux impériaux, des dumplings, etc.) et environ une trentaine de plats principaux (dont la grande majorité se compose d'assiettes à base de différentes fausses viandes, incluant poulet, buf, poisson, etc.). Il y a même des sushis et des desserts! Entre autres, j'ai trouvé les différentes sortes de végé-steak, les tranches de végé-buf avec sésame et les variations Imperial et General Tao du végé-poulet particulièrement réussies. Plusieurs plats à base de tofu, comme le nouveau tofu basilic, figurent également parmi les incontournables du restaurant. Le menu offre, pour le plupart, des plats véganes: seulement les quelques items marqués d'un astérisque ne le sont pas (protéines de lait et/ou ufs). Le fortune cookie remis à la fin de votre repas est aussi exempt de produit d'origine animale. Dommage que les différentes saveurs de crème glacée, qui composent pourtant la majorité des desserts disponibles, ne soient pas végétaliennes. Encore un petit effort et l'endroit pourrait être entièrement végane! Par contre, outre les quelques plats mentionnés, la nourriture est assez moyenne. Certaines préparations n'avaient pas beaucoup de goûts (comme les raviolis à la sauce arachide) et/ou n'étaient simplement pas appétissantes (je pense surtout au bloc de tofu souple qui baignait et s'effritait dans la sauce). On est assez loin de la qualité des plats préparés par ChuChai, un autre restaurant asiatique et végane un peu plus loin sur Saint-Denis. Surtout, lors de mon dernier passage chez Yuan, j'ai été déçu par le service: on avait à peine le temps de finir de manger que les serveurs se précipitaient pour combler la table d'autant d'assiettes que possible. À un certain point, quelqu'un a même déposé un plat sur mes ustensiles et ma napkin (!). Je comprends que le restaurant est assez occupé (surtout la fin de semaine) mais j'ai ressenti une pression constante pour manger au plus vite. Ce n'est pas le fun dans un contexte normal mais, quand on participe à un buffet où on aimerait prendre un peu de temps pour essayer les différentes saveurs offertes, c'est encore pire. Je n'ai pas non plus apprécié qu'aucun des serveurs ne prenaient le temps d'au moins dire le nom du plat qu'ils apportaient. Il y a aussi eu quelques erreurs avec la table à côté. Je n'ai pas non plus vu beaucoup de sourires. Je vous suggère de prendre une photo du menu (où vous avez coché tous vos choix) pour pouvoir vous en rappeler ensuite. Bref, le service, la qualité variable des plats proposés et les options véganes limitées pour les desserts sont les raisons pour lesquelles je ne recommanderais pas nécessairement Yuan. Par contre, je crois que l'expérience serait mieux appréciée en grands groupes (par exemple pour une fête ou une sortie entre amis et/ou en famille). Au passage, le restaurant comprend également un petit espace épicerie où plusieurs produits (surtout des fausses viandes) sont en vente. À essayer à la maison si vous avez fait de belles découvertes!"}
{"text":"Most of the stuff on the menu is super processed soy-based products, especially the mock meat items. Very salty or very sweet. Being sensitive to soy, this was not the place for me."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. We came back to try the All-You-Can-Eat buffet. It's available from 12 to 3. They gave us a paper menu were you mark what you wanted. We had no problem with any of the plates. They were all delicious! They brought them very fast and the waitress was very attentive.   Still can't figure it out why both times we have come there were only one extra couple eating. Is quite great for its price. $17 each person of the table.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Si vous aimez la bouffe végétarienne asiatique, vous allez aimez, l'intérieur est beau par contre, c'est un peu humide et froid comme ambiance et leurs toilettes pas si propre que ça. Je ne pense pas y retourner."}
{"text":"Yelpers were spot-on yet again!  In from out of town and was super-excited to find a completely vegetarian restaurant AND one that has tons o' sushi options! (I'm usually stuck with cucumber or avocado as my only choice).    Had the \"buffet\" lunch (everything's made fresh to order): seaweed salad, General Tao \"chicken\", and 4 sushi cones: \"eel\", California, spicy \"salmon\" and one other - one word: YUMMY!  Great concept, great food, great prices - next time I visit Montreal, will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has bento boxes of really good vegetarian food! The staff was very friendly and the restaurant is really clean and pleasant.   We went twice in two days and had no issues. All of the food was great. A great restaurant!"}
{"text":"J'adore ce restaurant. Si tu es végétarien ou connais des végétariens, tu seras toujours bien servi chez Yuan. Le service est très chaleureux. Petit bémol : durant les heures de grand achalandage (fin de semaine, etc.), le service peut parfois être un peu lent. Mais le menu à volonté saura satisfaire toute la table."}
{"text":"Fantastic mock meats and vegetarian dishes.  We ordered a variety of appetizers and mains to share and each was very well done.  The General Tao's faux chicken was our favorite  If you like vegetarian food, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"$20 cad for all you can eat off of the menu, which much resembles a dim sum menu. Food came out slooooow at odd intervals-- for example, we received soup, then 10 min later, sushi, then more apps and main courses randomly over the next 30 min. I was hungry and bored by the time our sautéed veggies came as a final course. The food was edible but just okay, very high in oil and lacking flavor. Sadly left my stomach with a burning feeling. In the end we probably ate less than if we'd each ordered a main course. I've eaten at lots of veggie Asian places and this was just about the bottom. Also a little dirty."}
{"text":"20$ all you can eat but almost all dishes taste the same ... I'm just saying...  many tables in a big place, nice decoration, good service, its up to you.."}
{"text":"Sadly, the food here wasn't very good :/  I didn't even finish my milk tea...and I love milk tea!  The whole place was deserted at lunch time.  The food is just standard Chinese food like from Panda Express or something, except without meat.  But their fake meat recipe needs some tweaking..."}
