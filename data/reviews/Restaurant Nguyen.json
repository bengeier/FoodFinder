{"text":"Very good restaurant, my first time ever in a vietnamese restaurant and it was really good. The staff is very kind and the restaurant is clean and the prices are very good!"}
{"text":"Not happy.   Usually we stop at cote-de-neigh for some Vietnamese food but decide to give a try close by.   The food was my disappointment. The soup oil and water no taste to it.   And our meal #9 was bad.   The rice tasted as it was wetted and microwaved.    The shrimps where chewy which tells me microwaved.   The beef was good but missing that unique taste.    Will not speak of the chicken.  The sauce was bland and the salad was awful.    I will try it another time during the weekend as I like small restaurant and giving local businesses a try.     Til next time."}
{"text":"The first time to come here.It's very worth to have a try.we ordered two meal from chef special: combos 6 & 1. The beef tasted great ,BBQ beef with fruits taste. Another one was mixed the seafood with cantonese style fired noodles.The taste is good as its looks.the sever can speak French and chinese and english.the environment makes me feel comfortable and romantic."}
{"text":"Ordered just eat because craving Vietnamese. Got the pho and satay beef. They were both good. I really liked the papaya beef salad. Will order again. Only complaint and why 1 star off is because the satay beef didn't come with enough rice."}
