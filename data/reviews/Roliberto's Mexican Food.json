{"text":"Rolibertos is fantastic! It is definitely the best berto place I've tried. Their menu is fairly standard and has items you could get at most other places. However, everything here tastes much better. The people working here are always very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I go the Carne asasda chimi enchilada style good but the horchata was better good service this is definitely the place for fast Mexican food"}
{"text":"My favorite grab a bite quick taco shop that has daily specials and great food that is fresh and tastes good , the Menudo is pretty good also"}
{"text":"Everything is fresh, the cook and waiter was friendly. Although the language berrier, the food was excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"I have lived steps away from this place for years and a few months ago, my boyfriend suggested I give it a try. Since I'm very picky with mexican food places, I had doubts, but boy was I wrong! All I can say is wow!!! This place is amazingly delicious. I thought I would never find a place who served authentic Mexican tacos and out of the blue I found it in a hole in the wall strip mall and just steps from my house! This can be a good thing, but also a dangerous thing because I am trying to lose weight. 


This place is so good. I got two tacos and I know I will be going back again and again."}
{"text":"CLOSED! Went here to get some food along with the Sunday special around 4pm in the afternoon just to find out the doors are closed and noone inside. 
Do not rely on the prices posted with the photos here at yelp for Rolibertos. I expected super nachos as seen here on the photo for $6.50 and was charged around $9 something"}
{"text":"We tried breakfast burritos.  They tasted really good, however, lacked the bacon we ordered in it. There was bacon, however, most other place like this pack the burritos with it.  I found a few small pieces.  
 
All in all...ok."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant  two oppotunities and both went bad.. their meat has no flavor and their horchata is water down. There prices not extremely high but higher then other Mexican restaurants. I do expect the meat to atleast have some flavor and not get an extrene water down horchata.. I was given the wrong order after waiting for a long time for my food. The customer service is okay. I will never go there again.. I am giving the customer service a 3 or 4 star but rating their food a 2.."}
{"text":"Was Craving menudo.  Found this place through Yelp. 
Ordered 2  orders of menudos and a cup of coffee. 
Menudo was terrible, very greasy, what! no oregano!
Instant coffee was also terrible. 
Wouldn't recommend menudo."}
{"text":"Love all the people who work at this place. Maria always challenges me to speak the espanole with her,its fun. We now have a tradition,ITS TACO TUESDAY!!!!!!.  These are the best ground beef tacos. Addicting!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure on all the other reviews but never coming back here. Service was prompt enough, but some of my pork was RAW! I only ate half my burrito and threw the rest away. The favors weren't very good. The red and green sauces were okay at best. Other than hopefully not getting sick, I didn't like my burrito sitting in a ton of watery juice in the plate. I went here since my go to place isn't open on Sunday. Huge mistake... If you decide to try it out, don't get a burrito and make sure your meat is actually cooked."}
{"text":"THUMBS DOWN.... Really? When you walk in, the counter has security bars all around it!? We stood for three minutes at the counter, ready to order. We were never greeted but there were 3 people working.... There were no other customers there...not in a good location, between smoke shop and nail salon. 
Who really gave this place so many stars?!"}
{"text":"The monstrosities that come from this kitchen aren't fit for my dogs. Seriously... My wife and I came here late one night on our way home. Figured we'd be safe and ordered 2 beef tacos, 2 chicken tacos, and a carne asada burrito. The beef tacos were edible at best. The chicken literally tasted like fish and I had to dissect our tacos just to be sure they weren't. The carne asada was horrible and tasted like dog food. Would give this place a negative review if it was possible. Not sure how this place for any positive reviews."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food! Great burritos, tacos, horchata is bomb, fajitas, and nachos! The breakfast burritos are the BEST I have ever had! No joke! Fresh friendly food and atmosphere. Will always go back!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. The guacamole is fresh and their guacamole salsa is delicious. Our family always does taco Tuesday. We have tried many taco shops around and this place is hands down the best!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Mexican food near me. I love the rolled tacos. Drive-Thru can be a bit slow at times but other than that the food is good!"}
{"text":"My wife and I walked 5 miles to this location, and it was worth every step! Great food, friendly service and generous servings. So good, we went twice in one day, for lunch and dinner (we drove the second time). The price is also pretty good, around $7 for two good sized tacos, rice, beans and a drink. The food is made to order, which means you might have to wait a little. But when it arrives, it's hot, fresh and served with a smile."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food and great prices.  MUCH better than the Mexican takeout place just down the street on Grand Avenue (Humbertos).

The have a great daily special everyday except Friday and Saturday.  We usually go on Monday for the .99 bean burrito.  It's .89 extra for cheese,  but price is still unbeatable."}
{"text":"When I went there tonight, I watched the lady blow her nose put the nasty tissue in her apron pocket and then put my food,unpackaged fork, and my napkins in the bag without washing her hands. I was sooo grossed out! I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I have found so far in the surprise area! The Carne asana burrito is outstanding, and I love that they give you plenty of salsa with it. Staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I'm not gonna say whether it's authentic or not cuz I'm not Mexican. But the food tastes amazing. Loco Breakfast burrito is great, the surf and turf burrito is great as well!"}
{"text":"Came by at 8:10am on Sunday, March 4. They were closed. Posted hours say they open at 8am on Sundays. Super disappointed. It was my first time coming here. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Great price for amount of food u get and quality. Staff is very friendly and place is always kept clean."}
{"text":"Authentic, great food, and very inexpensive. The surf and turf burrito is my favorite."}
{"text":"Their coupon on yelp for \"$1 off any burrito\" they do not honor it when you come to the window. They act like they know nothing about the coupon. Disappointing, why would they have it on here then."}
{"text":"Pretty good for fast Mexican food!!!! Better than all the other bertos for sure in my opinion!!"}
{"text":"Every time we come here the drive thru wait is ridiculous and you would think the food would at least be fresh based on the wait and no everytime we wait to get nasty inedible food. The breakfast burrito my boyfriend brought home has nothing but burnt bacon pieces in it and the tortilla was as hard as a cracker smh such a waste of time and money. Not too mention the rude lady at the window from my last experience lol this will be the last time we go here for mediocre food I would rather drive a little further to get a better experience."}
{"text":"Me and my husband love this place.. this is our go to place after 9pm since they open till late. Love their service and the lady at the counter tries to teach us spanish, which is hilarious when I get it all wrong. But they always ready to add, delete and customise the dish as per your whims n fancies. .for the price, freshness, good service and taste, this place is better then the fancy, expensive restaurants. It's a small mom n pop shop, not much of an ambience here, so think b4 you decide to have a dinner date here ;)"}
{"text":"I am originally from San Diego so of course I'm a little bit of a taco snob but my review is not for the tacos. I actually have yet to have their tacos but one thing that is very important to me is that your bean game be strong. This is super important to me because as weird as it may sound my favorite burrito is pretty much a bean and cheese with sour cream. Red sauce on the side. I know it's really simple but if your refried beans are on point then this burrito is simply delicious. I'm new to Phoenix so as soon as I got here the search was on for my favorite taco shop that had amazing beans. I went through half a dozen places before I found Roliberto's. Their game is strong, my friends. their bean game that is..... Delicious!
Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the rolled tacos. Was very extremely disappointed the other day when I bit into my first rolled taco and literally tasted nothing but fried tortilla. A couple of bites of this and I knew that my dinner was shot for the night. There was literally the most minuscule amount of meat you can possibly put in a rolled taco. After a while I had to see for myself and I just opened the last one up to reveal more than a half a rolled taco with almost zero mean in it. 
Yep.... My dinner that night was fried tortilla with guac and sour cream on it. Not very satisfying and very pretty upsetting. Will go back for their bean and cheese with sour cream burritos but will NEVER order their rolled tacos again.

The red sauce is hot but delicious."}
{"text":"Good food for the price. I am a regular here,  because of the daily special. Under 7$ will buy you a big burrito, refried beans, rice, and a drink. It is almost enough food for 2 people. I like the chicken better than the beef.  I also really like their 2 hot sauces, good flavor.  The tacos are good also.  I recommend trying this place for yourself. It is the best 'berto in my experience."}
{"text":"This is the best dive Mexican food place. Super Nachos, are loaded. Feeds two. Enchiladas, so good. Tacos are awesome. Forget the other bertos this is the place. Quick, good service, good food."}
{"text":"So far I've been waiting a ridiculous amount of time here in the drive thru. Of course, I read about the horrendous wait time after I got here. LOL
I'll update as soon as I get home (tomorrow at this point! Hahaha), on how the food is.
Ok, wait time wasn't thaaaaat bad, I guess.
Def needs more beef in the tacos. But it was seasoned pretty darn good. This is the first time I've ever eaten at a 'bertos & NOT had soggy tacos oozing w/ grease. Out of 3 tacos, I literally had 2 drops total. They held together & were actually \"crunchy\" tacos. Rice was eh. I've had better. They do still have the taco specials but they're $1.39 now instead of $.99. The red sauce was great. Kids meal isn't a bad deal either. $4.xx for a bean & cheese burrito, fries, 2 churros & a bottle of Welch's juice (you get to choose from 3 kinds). All in all, when I need my taco fix, this is DEF my new go to."}
{"text":"We ordered in via Grub hub... the beef was so dang salty... in the burrito it only had Pico de gallo no fat to cut the salinity. I like salt too... when I added some guacamole and sour cream from the fridge....it wasn't bad! But again I like salt. The rolled tacos were horrible... actually brown and burnt, tossed them in the bin. The super nachos were loaded with tons of beef, lots of meat for sure... same super salty beef. Where were the beans, sour cream... none of that fresh mex... tomato's, lettuce just one note salty and in beef pellet form. The beef looked ground, in pellet form, not what I'm used to."}
{"text":"My review is based off their chorizo and egg burrito, which is what I always get. Its not super greasy and it's delicious."}
{"text":"Everything is Overpriced. Every couple of months their prices rise and now it's almost $10 for a plate of 3 rolled tacos beans and rice. I'd rather pay the same price at a restaurant that gives free chips, salsa and free refills to wait for an expensive meal."}
{"text":"Best sauces in town! Can't go wrong with bean and cheese with crispy papas and sour cream."}
{"text":"Ok here we go ,got green chili burrito  2 nights in a row,omfg,the best around,the restaurant  is dialed in and the cook is the bomb,got 1/2 order of nachoes with everything, 2 beef tacos ,wheeeeewwwww ,awesommmeeee!,prices great,salsa bar,we will be back ."}
{"text":"FYI their carne asada fries are $9.09 pretty expensive then what I usually pay for but it's pretty good. You can probably go somewhere else that's cheaper and still taste just as good but overall staff was friendly, didn't have to wait very long for my to go and the food was pretty good"}
{"text":"Found this ace by accident and it's our favorite! Simple in appearance the food is Amazing!!! Better than Los Betos, Filibertos, Nicos- you get my drift! Steak burrito- quality meat, not filled with crap meat. Nachos are amazing, meat, real cheese fresh tomatoes. Fresh ingredients. Shrimp al Diablo .... the best. Again I am stressing the quality of the meat, fresh ingredients - surpassed the other places listed. the quality is amazing and the flavor the best."}
{"text":"This place does have good and cheap food considering all things.  It looks a little dirty there all the time so I don't really like eating there.  It's not about how much they scrub it or how clean it looks, it's the paint, the tables, and the floors that make it all look dirty.  The place needs a face lift for sure and in it's current state no amount of pinesol or bleach will make an appearance difference.

The food taste good, the prices are cheap, and the staff is always nice."}
{"text":"I would like to give this place a 4-5 star like others BUT I cant until I give them another shot. We ordered 2 BEEF tacos and a Carnitas torta....excited to come home to enjoy and what do we pull out of our bag??? 1 BEEF 1 CHICKEN taco, Carne asada fries, and 2 chicken enchiladas....ummmm apparently we got the wrong order... but guess what, Stuff happens...Fortunately for them im not picky and still ate the food. Fries were good (wish it came with Sour Cream), beef taco was great, chicken - DRY, and the enchiladas stole the show....surprising they were fantastic! Besides the fact they got my entire order wrong, food was decent enough to have me try them again...until next time Mr Roli...until next time..."}
{"text":"Mexican Food-101....small joints kick-ass!!

Coming out of a gym of all places I discovered this little joint across the street.  I started to get that \"warm tingling inside\" and that is always a tell-tale sign that good food is near.

Small quintessential Mexican-Joint with the requisite Mexican ice-cream cooler near the counter.  The menu is dizzying with ALL the favs.  I quickly settled on a carne-asada torta and a small order of taquitos with gauco.

It took a good 10 minutes for the food to come up, which is a good sign that freshness is happening in the kitchen.  The torta was the best ever.....bursting with flavor and the seasonings were perfecto!!  The taquitos were delicious and the icy cold Coca Cola washed it all down and soothed the fire.

What an amazing little gem!  For their sake I hope you all give them a try, for my sake I hope no one else ever discovers this little slice of perfection on the WestSide!!

Oh best part.....$ 8.50.....and it could have fed TWO!"}
{"text":"This place is under new management since the last time we had gone in couple years ago. It is so much better than I remember and wish I had started going here sooner rather than the other place down the street on Grand.  The food is a little better priced in my opinion and definitely better variety. I recommend the Mar and Tierra burrito which has shrimp and carne asada; I like spicy foods but I usually end up getting this burrito minus the red sauce it is super spicy. I also recommend the El Panzon burrito, it has chicken, carne asada, retried beans, and shrimp; I also get this minus red sauce. 

The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is due to one of the cashiers that works there during the lunch shift. Every single time I have gone in there durning her shift, the mere sigh of a customer puts her in an instant bad mood. If you don like your job then don't do it! 

Be careful when ordering the numbered items though because some menu items share the same numbers. Be specific!"}
{"text":"Despite the funky location between the smoke shop and the nail salon, Rolibertos manages to  have a fun Mexi-traditional interior with bright colors and engaging music playing. Prices are very reasonable and food is fresh. My personal taste is that the rice and beans are oversalted..very oversalted. The chili relleno burritto I had was scrummy, though, so I'll just stick to the main dishes if I return."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened but the beans were watery and had ZERO flavor, the tacos were not crispy at all and the carne asada was bland... First time in YEARS we had bad food here. I hope they recover."}
{"text":"Damn this food is bomb! Flavor is so good lots of meet and spice, great salsa bar the best salsas so good! Great menu, good specials and homemade food natural.. Thank you"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect gave 4stars because their not open 24 hours. I got a El bandito burrito and my fiance got a combo meal with rice,beans,cheese enchilada and a shredded beef burrito. The prices are reasonable and the customer  service was great. All in all should have been 4 in half stars but can't do half's..... and could have been 5 stars if they were open 24hours. Can't wait to go back and use my dollar off coupon!!!"}
{"text":"Great food great value. Wish it was 24 hours. The tortillas were amazing and the staff was super friendly. The prices were great."}
{"text":"Dang good Tacos Tuesday and Wednesday they have taco deals. Their patron burrito has some kick but not bad the place has a ton of led lights and the drive thru is strange but if you go left you can get out on the frontage road service is a tad slow but worth it."}
{"text":"I was getting hungry after early morning Xmas shopping.  I was trying to decide what to eat or where to eat. Golden corral,  to crowded and to much food
  Chinese buffet all you get eat,  fried rice ,seafood, etc. Burger king, no tired of burger. Mexican food tired of that also.
  then I'm thinking what type of Mexico I couldn't narrow it down so what popped in mine nacho. Not to much not to little but just right for my  Appetite.
 So i ended up Mexican fopd.Order nachos  which was just right I had a lots of me cheese, lots of sour cream,    guacamole. It hit the   spot recommend it And it also has a drive-through"}
{"text":"The food was alright, but the lady that took my order was absolutely horrible. I asked for my tacos to not have guacamole and they still put it on. It wasn't the first time. I told her about it and she immediately got defensive saying that I didn't ask for it and that she could show me tape to prove it. I told her I did and that I didn't want them like that. She offered me a refund in a very condescending and confrontational manner. I told her that she shouldn't be rude, that I am a customer there, and she said she could act however she wanted to. I was very courteous and polite, just like how I would expect to be treated. I don't understand how someone that works in customer service can have the awful attitude she displayed tonight."}
{"text":"Friendly, professional, fresh made breakfast burritos. The smells of the fresh cooked ingredients was mouth watering. My only gripe is that there was NO spice on my burrito. The sauce was OK that they offered, but it needed a little kick to clear the sinuses. Other than that, it was a positive experience overall. 

I did hit them negatively a while back for not being open during business hours. The owner responded and apologized, professionals!!!! Either way , they have since redeemed themselves two-fold."}
{"text":"To say we were surprised is an understatement! Roliberto's is a hidden gem in the heart of El Mirage. They have a drive-thru which is a huge plus for those late night cravings! We ordered a few different items including the shrimp burrito (deliciously spicy!), fish tacos and a mangonada. The mangonada was out of this world! I couldn't believe the menu selection compared to other Mexican joints in the area. Everything was amazing and the price was right, too. I honestly don't think I'll go anywhere else to get my Mexican food fix fix!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food. I would recommend  the burrito called \"el panzone\". It had steak, shrimp and chicken..very good."}
{"text":"The awesome reviews for this place swayed me to try it and I'm so glad!!! The food here knocks all the other little Mexican joints out of the park. I had the carne asada tacos and shared some carne asada fries and wow!! The meat had awesome seasoning, everything was piping hot and the salsas do not disappoint! I highly recommend this place so be sure to try it. You'll be glad you did and your tummy will love you for it :)"}
{"text":"My family eats here at least once or twice a week. Great food. Our usual orders include the Bandito Burrito, lengua/carnita mini tacos, carne asada burrito, and menudo on the weekends."}
{"text":"The machaca is BOMB, so get it in a breakfast burrito. Great sauces (like five of em) and free chips and salsa with your order. Clean and tasty! -1 star for a little excess grease leaking outta my burrito... But it was delicious, so..."}
{"text":"Get the breakfast burrito with egg, ham, potato and cheese. Top it with green sauce and a horchata to drink then thank me later. P.S. Don't let the bars or the area scare you away from the amazing food."}
{"text":"Omg sooo good bad ass salsas... flavors are delicious and everything was so delicious! Nice and spicy! Salsa bar is so good burritos are big and goid specials... so so yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The best bertos place in Phoenix. The lengua is great. Love the service. Food is prepared fresh and place seems clean. Good taco shop for the money and way cheaper than filipbertos."}
{"text":"With all the \"biertos\" this is the best. Guac is natural and the meat look and taste real. Open 24hrs."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for years and it is always on my mind. Carne asada burritos, Carne asada fries, breakfast burritos, huevos rancheros. :) 

Can't wait until I go there again."}
{"text":"I love this place by I do and the food is great the wait time had gone down. I have to say no I went by to get some food and I open my taco and where the hell is the beef ??????? Seriously I was so disappointed because they have great food I expected more !!!!"}
{"text":"okay so this place is around the area where I'm always around and only ate there once before. I go in tonight and order a shrimp cocktail. As I'm waiting, a couple comes in and places a to go order and gets their order and leaves. I inquiry about my order and why it's taking so long. The obese poker face large woman looks at me and tells me that it's not ready. Her and the cook go back and make it as I'm waiting standing up, she brings it to go and I tell her it's for here. No customer service poker face goes and pours it In a glass. I eat it, it's okay cuz I'm hungry. Well a few hours later, here I am puking all the shrimp cocktail away. I don't know what they did to it, or it wasn't fresh or whatever the cause was, but it ruined my Friday night. Got dressed up for nothing. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE. No wonder they got bars around the cashier. They should be ashamed of themselves for making people sick."}
{"text":"Cute little spot. My favorite is the El Bandido burrito & my hubby fav is the Carnitas platter. Good chili & the taquitos are also a favorite. Only been couple times but we shall be back"}
{"text":"This place has the best Mexican food in the west valley. My wife an I lived in San Antonio before and have been looking for a legit place for Mexican food. We found it here. I rated this place 4 stars as the place was a little untidy when we arrived and the menu was way too busy. Over all great food though."}
{"text":"Food 3.5 out of 4

Decent mexican food. Great drive-thru service. Big portions for a decent price. I got the carne torta combo.. comes with beans, rice, and a drink... all for about $8 to $9.

Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"New to town and have tried many bertos type places around town,but i think i found my gem. Rolibertos is the spot with good mexican style food and awesome burritos and tacos. Fish tacos are great and they have daily specials. If you by Union Hills and 35th, stop by and check them out. My new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday it is for my family! Awesome tacos way better than Taco smell & Del tacos. Nice & clean establishment willing to try other entrees at later time."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday and man they piss me off. Got two chicken tacos 2 beef tacos and an order of fries extra crispy the fries weren't even done enough for regular fries let alone being crispy second of that they forgot to put tacos in the bag and I had to go back. When I point out the fries to the lady she wanted to take them from me and put them back in the fryer of total health code violation WTF!"}
{"text":"A little pricey for a burrito but very good quality. It took a bit of time to get but the lady helping me was very friendly. Overall good stuff but might not be everyone's cup of tea. I appreciate Filiberto's prices a bit better. This is only speaking from someone who has used the drive-thru and has not been inside."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of breakfast burritos. Not too bad, a little dry, too much potatoes, had better. The hot sauce was decent and pricing on par. However, what put me off big-time was the obvious pro illegal immigration, anti Border Patrol posters. You wanna have your political opinion? Great, but it doesn't belong in a restaurant. I'll take my $ elsewhere where they respect the laws of our country."}
{"text":"My favorite late night food craving! Love the hours for this very reason! Always hot always good service and love their red sauce!!!"}
{"text":"This place is always good. Daily .99 specials and on Sunday it's 3 rolled tacos. Whoot! Whoot!

The kids love the #2 kids meal. Its a bean and cheese burro with fries, a churro and a juice drink for $2.99. For REAL?! You bet. Bite it McD's. My kids have a way happier meal from here without the cheesy toy.

Super nachos are my fave and always last into the next day due to the portion size.

The place is always clean and the girl behind the jail bars (order window) is always friendly.

PS. they don't take American Express."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid 3 stars here.  By far the best thing about this place is the price.  I think it was $5.99 for 3 tacos with a lot of meat, rice, beans and a drink.  I couldn't finish all the food and I rarely say that.  As for the quality of food, well, I think you get what you pay for.  The carne asada was kind of bland and not as tender as I like it.  I would say if you need something cheap and in a hurry, you could roll up on Rolibertos in a pinch."}
{"text":"Okay, this is your typical Phoenix short order Mexican joint as far as atmosphere goes. Hint: Don't be scared of the bars guarding the register and kitchen, honestly, I love the atmosphere of this place and have never seen sketchy people in there. The food is outstanding! The carne asada has crispy edges from being cooked on the plancha but it's not dry at all and pack some great flavor. The tortillas are soft and fresh and the Pico is on point with the perfect amount of lime juice and perfect sized cuts. Also the tacos are outstanding and only 99 cents on Tuesday and Wednesday. This is my new go to spot for a quick and delicious bite. Do yourself a favor, skip Filibertos and come here for better food at better prices. Love it!"}
