{"text":"Great new lounge location in Uptown Charlotte next to 5 Church. Laid back atmosphere with smooth down tempo music. Grab an open seat by the open air windows and people watch or chill in one of the comfy couches."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  But, BUYER BEWARE!!  Check your receipt before paying.  I got charged more than the sum of my drinks.  Before tax my drinks totaled $27.  My bill before tax was $32.  They charged me a mysterious up charge of $5. The up charge did not show up as a line on the receipt (making my drink $19, which is more than any of their specialty drinks).  Sadly, I paid before catching the charge. Mainly due to the fact it took 45 min to get one drink and we had to leave for a concert. The manger took my name and number to call me the next day and provide a gift card.  I never heard from him.  

Could be a great place, but needs serious help in customer service and transparency."}
{"text":"This place has a beautiful Victorian aura. I came with some colleagues and we ordered the charcuterie platter, unfortunately the waitress didn't explain the components of the platter. The platter wasn't the best I've had: it came with some crostini, salami and other cured meats, a very little portion of cheese, honey and mustard. I also ordered a glass of Pinot noir which was pretty good. I would come back to try other items on their menu however this review reflects my impression of their charcuterie platter."}
{"text":"Really interested location and lounge with a cool and unique atmosphere and a great assortment of unique craft cocktails. I would recommend this area for a group of friends within their late 20s and older who are interested in a seemingly exclusive and classy experience. 
To pair with your drinks I recommend you try the to cucumber caprese"}
{"text":"Super neat and beautiful venue, the decoration is very ornate and eye-catching, upscale cocktail lounge with ample seating and great atmosphere. Many young professionals there; its a great place to start out your night or to end it after a nice dinner at the restaurant, 5Church, which is just next door!  My girlfriends and I ended up staying at Sophia's Lounge all night, it was a very nice bar. Loved how the doors were able to open to the street and feel the breeze come in as well. Definitely a must go-to-lounge in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"I was originally headed to 5 Church, which is next door, but the restaurant was closed for a private event.  5 Church and Sophia's lounge apparently share chefs.  

Love the atmosphere and ambiance here!  The decor is beautiful, regal, and fun.  The menu consists of small plates, so best for before or after dinner.  Enjoyed a cocktail and a bite to eat before walking around the area.  

Service was courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"Love the decor and the food was so yummy. I don't like lobster and I tried the lobster sliders and they were amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome space, great cocktails (Where is the Honey was my fav), cool lounge vibe and ambiance, but don't go for dinner...otherwise you might pay $30 something dollars each small plate for a few little sliders or bites that aren't even that great.  Our friends and I ended up going out for food after leaving this place with our wallets already emptied out.  Knowledge is power - just go for drinks ;)"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks to celebrate a friend's whopping 34th birthday!!! Woot woot! This place has pretty eclectic decor.  Apparently each area in this bar/lounge is decorated differently but becuase of the alcohol, I can't remeber why. The music is pumping and you can reserve tables. They also serve small plates if you need some bites while you're drinking. They have a variety of hand crafted cocktails, many had egg in them, which is not my jam. But beware, the drinks are on the expensive end. A glass of rose' cost me $15. Not quite sure if I'll be back bc of the expensive drinks but the atmosphere is pretty great."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by for a drink after dinner.  We were seated and waited maybe 10 minutes before anyone came over.  We assumed she came over to bring us menus or similar, but instead asked if we had a reservation.  We said no, we were seated by...(and pointed to the person).  She told us they were booked for the night and to leave the table.  It was insanely rude.  I asked why we were seated and she made some snarky comment and walked away.  We got up and stood there like idiots for a minute figuring out where to go.  Not that it matters, but we were well dressed and are both professionals that work 1/2 block away.  

I would absolutely never return.  We crossed the street and went to 204 North which had wonderful drinks."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior and friendly staff. Nice selection of drinks. Recommend for a nice evening with refined ambience. So much to do in the area as well."}
{"text":"The staff is great! They are friendly and attentive! Drinks and food are great! The ambiance is everything! Justin is a great manager!"}
{"text":"Much needed addition to uptown with a little New Orleans flair. Drink menu needs to expand a bit but otherwise a great option."}
{"text":"I was expecting more from the crew, that brought 5Church to Charlotte.... with that said, the interior was amazing! However, that is the only selling point Sophia's has to offer. The drinks do not compare to the craft cocktails of the Cellar or the Punch Room, the food (small shareable plates) is mediocre (was expecting a bit more from the celebrity chef)... The worst \"surprise\" came from the bathroom, without paper towels or toilet paper, drinks left from the opening night sitting around, and overflowing trash cans. Overall, the place seemed promising, but failed to deliver. Not going to be our \"destination spot\" as we were hoping for. #dissapointed"}
{"text":"Very nice clean  place as a date night or a girls night . The atmosphere is very relaxing ! Me and my boyfriend went just for drinks . I got the Shakespeare drink
, it was very well made ! I definitely will be returning ! Thanks Yelp :)"}
{"text":"Super mediocre.  Amateur service. Waited 15 minutes for a glass of wine and had to remind our server I'd ordered it twice. Ok cocktails.  5 Church isn't a home run much of the time, so our expectations were fairly low."}
{"text":"Great drinks and great service. The bartender had great suggestions for drinks that weren't on the menu."}
{"text":"Great service and very accommodating. The chic vibe is worth the price. Great addition to uptown Charlotte as it's unique and unpretentious."}
{"text":"I finally got to check this place out! So funny story, when asking a handful of my friends if they've ever been here resulting in every single one say \"yeah I think so but it was really late and I hardly remember\". We showed up for a drink around 5 on a Tuesday before the blackfinn yelp elite event. The decor is so fun and cozy, I'm really excited to have more places like this in uptown. I ordered the midnight kiss at the recommendation of the bartender and it was very strong and very good. My friend ordered a maple whisky drink and it was amazing! I'm removing a star for very expensive prices and the fact that all the female employees wear the same very very short cocktail dress and that kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I would come back!"}
{"text":"You definitely don't need a reservation if you show up before 9pm. The drinks are good, pricey, but good. The atmosphere as well is wonderful and you can wear clothes that aren't fancy. Some people wore jeans and others were very dressed up,m - whatever you are comfortable with."}
{"text":"One of the most gorgeous bars that I've been to! Great service for being so busy on a Saturday night. You can tell the bartenders take their time making their delicious cocktails (in a good way). Just stopped in for one drink. Ordered the Shakespeare and loved it! Stop here for a date night or girls night. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Super romantic and comfortable!  Been there 2 times for after dinner drinks and it was really wonderful.  Service is amazing."}
{"text":"Nice setting but average wine for the price. Although it's not a wine bar, instead of having 5 average glasses of wine to choose from, have two very good glasses - would definitely round out the menu."}
{"text":"Looking to try a new spot for a hot date tonight? I got your back. 
For a memorable date, come here for your unexpected finale. Enjoy a nightcap and/or a digestif at one of the city's hottest affairs: Sophia's Lounge.
What separates Sophia's Lounge from all the other lounges is that it's unquestionably the most luxurious lounge in Charlotte - as of now. Think glimmering chandeliers, vintage touches, velvet sofas and vibrant European flair. 
Sophia's Lounge (named for Queen Sophia Charlotte,) is located inside the newly renovated historic Ivey's Hotel in Uptown. Seriously gorgeous and stunning cocktail-sipping spot, with NYC chill vibe.

Pro tip: Complimentary Valet Mon.-Sat. 6pm-till.

Yes, it's the perfect date nightcap.
Four and Half Yelps."}
{"text":"Sophia's lounge is a new luxurious cocktail bar. It was so chic, vintage, royal-like, and the decor was to die for. We couldn't stop looking around. The atmosphere was so unique and exactly what Charlotte needed. We wanted everything on the menu. I'm talking about the food AND the drinks. I started with the Lolita for my first cocktail. It had Campari, Cocchi, Americana, still and sparkling rose, and grapefruit bitters. Perfection. We were so hungry, so we ordered their impressive charcuterie board and the lamb tartare. The lamb tartare had smoked olive oil, harissa aioli, shaved radish, crispy shallot, and polenta crackers. It was so unique and so full of flavor. it was recommended by our (freaking amazing) waitress, and it did not disappoint. We were having so much fun and did not want to leave, so we ordered a bottle of wine. After we had our wine, we agreed on one more drink! I ordered the YUZU  The yuzu had yuzu, grapefruit orange bitters, cherry, and mezcal lunazul Anejo tequila! I was SO SO SO SO impressed with Sophia's Lounge. It's right next to 5Church, and across from The Dandelion Market. Make a reservation and GO!"}
{"text":"Truly an amazing experience! Excellent cocktails, atmosphere and shareable plates! Scotch quail egg for the win!"}
{"text":"Do you usually get an out-of-body experience when drinking a cocktail that feels like you're suddenly in a rose garden? No? Me either, but that's how I felt when I ordered (two rounds) of the Shakespeare this past Saturday night. WOW - what an incredible creation! Rose-infused vodka (yes, this is a thing!) is delightfully light, pleasantly sweet without any of that overly-sugary nonsense, and topped with a couple of spritzes of some yummy rose-smelling perfume, for lack of a better term, and a rose petal. Just...wow. 

The hubby and my friends also enjoyed their cocktails (maybe not quite at my level, but still), and we spent a good couple of hours at Sophia's. The swanky vibe at the bar and in its adjoining sitting areas with velvet couches and crystal chandeliers just make you feel fancy. Drinks are definitely on the pricey end but their uniqueness is definitely worth it for a fun night out."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!  Its a great spot for a late night drink or afternoon with the girls!  The ambiance is super cool and the drinks are even cooler!  Nothing like a refreshing drink with friends on a Charlotte summer afternoon!  So YES local or visitor this place is a must!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, overpriced drinks, expensive food for the portion size.  Manager and bartender were attentive for the first 20 minutes then disappeared. 3 stars are for the great drinks."}
{"text":"Went with a group of friends and love the atmosphere and vibe here. The interior design makes it a great place to relax with drinks and food. Will def be a regular at Sophia's!"}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. Yes. I love sexy lowkey venues here and this is exactly what Sophias is. Came here for my friends bday. The crab cakes were A GOD SEND, that romulade was dreamy and the drinks and were ok. Kinda watered down but MEH what can ya do."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar where the bartender handed me a dirty and wrinkled paper menu.
The (uniform )shirt that the bartender was wearing looked like it has never been washed 
Polite and professional he was but 
I don't think that a bartender should be eating  bar snacks at any time behind the bar wile having a conversation with a guest?"}
{"text":"What an awesome place to spend your 4 year anniversary. Comfy couches, personable waitresses, warm atmosphere & great artisan drinks. 

SL was recommended from some random bar people folks I've met during my many bar crawls. Having moved from the Jersey/NY area spots like SL were a fun spot to meetup with friends after work to just chill didn't think Charlotte had spots like this. 

I'm a fan of whiskey & bourbon so I was excited that SL had a few artisan creations for my liking which included egg whites which contrary to popular demand is awesome in whiskey/bourbon drinks. 

The decor of SL is very welcoming and they bouncer actually smiled & spoke, I mean who knew they could smile . Overall such a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend to others. I unfortunately arrived when the kitchen had closed so didn't get a chance to try the Lamb Lollipops so another reason as if I needed another to come back to visit. They're willing to mix and make personalized cocktails as well mine was awesome.

The only reason why I didn't give them a 5 is mainly it's super dark and I could barely read the menu without my phone light. 

If you're looking for an upscale type of night and have a few extra coins to put into the economy, try out SL you won't be disappointed.

Fun fact, SL is owned by 5 Church, who knew and they share a kitchen haha. Things you learn while talking to the locals. Ciao!"}
{"text":"A sweet addition to uptown!! With its beautiful decor and friendly service, Sophia's lounge is a great place for some cocktails and conversation! 

You can go fancy with your cocktail, or stick with a classic... either way the bartenders do a good job! I stuck with a classic 'ol dirty martini, but had a taste of the \"come on sp'in\" which was quite refreshing! 

Their small plates to share are really good too (Same exec chef as 5Church.. that explains that!) if you want something to nibble on, with your drinks. 

The decor is unique in that there isn't another bar in uptown that looks like it.. it's luxurious and kinda fancy... yet cozy. The noise and light levels were perfect; something that many lounges and bars are yet to get right!

All in all - I'm a fan of Sophia's Lounge, and would recommend it if you're looking for a great lounge in the heart of uptown!! :)"}
{"text":"Sophia's Lounge was the last stop on my Wednesday date night with The Lady, and what a swanktastic place this is. All of the couches, all of the ambiance, and great drinks to boot. 
We walked in and honestly, didn't know how it worked. We saw plenty of tables and chairs, and a bar, and quickly found out that there were in fact servers walking around taking orders. So, we got comfy on the biggest, most opulent, most Pier One-ish couch we could find, and our waitress came by shortly after to give us some drink recommendations. The Lady ordered Where Is the Honey while I ordered Come On Sp'in. Phew, it was spiiicy! But perfect for what I wanted. Just a warning to all those out there who don't like spicy drinks, don't even think about this one. But for those who do, jump on it. 
I finished off ordering one more, the Higher Education, which was so wonderfully nutty and semi sweet. 

Prices were normal uptown prices at $12, and service was friendly and wonderful. I'd highly recommend anybody who loves cocktails to come check out Sophia's Lounge!"}
{"text":"On a Wednesday night, we decided to make our last stop Sophia's Lounge, however I wish we would have come in earlier.
The atmosphere is so inviting, quaint bar with couches around allowing guests to feel relaxed in a trendy environment.
The menu offers a variety of specialty cocktails and food, although the food seems more like small bites or tapas. I did hate that we had already eaten because everything sounded amazing. And, I did find out that the food items are prepared by 5 Church...knowing that now I will be back to try a few items.
Service was a little disappointing, with what I think was due to a change in shifts, but overall I really enjoyed our drinks and the environment.
I will definitely be back."}
