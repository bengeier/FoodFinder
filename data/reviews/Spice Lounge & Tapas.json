{"text":"Great food! Love how they give the option of grilled calamari rather than fried. Lovely service. Will be sure to come back with the family again!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, warm atmosphere.  I liked the bar selection,  I had a lovely cocktail (Old Fashioned,  if I recall), and got to try an Estrella Spanish beer.  I liked the Red Stag Chorizo, Mushroom Risotto croquettes,  and Beef Sliders.  Alternative music for our night's soundtrack.   We need to come back for more someday."}
{"text":"Most amazing chicken liver pate and the service and drinks are always high quality, really love this place!"}
{"text":"Great bar with a good atmosphere and friendly crowd. My only complaint is that this place is tiny."}
{"text":"Great hangout!  Make sure you have reservations.  Take advantage of the live music on Saturdays.  Our server was really helpful.  We ordered some really yummy tapas and drinks.  Plenty of parking around the area and free - bonus..."}
{"text":"Small, dark and intimate - a very nice place for a date. Quite empty around dinnertime, but I guess it picks up later at night. Portions are decent sizes and reasonably priced. Three or four tapas will suit a couple nicely. 

Sangria leaves something to be desired; too much ice/juice/other stuff really waters down the taste. The juice-box sangria in Spain is better.

Menu selection isn't huge and the typical Spanish tortilla is strangely absent from the menu, but the food is tasty. Highly recommend the patatas bravas. Meat & cheese board had a nice selection of cured meats, pickled vegetables, cheeses and jam."}
{"text":"So glad my girlfriend brought me here. Food was so good the flavours seemed to be dancing on my tongue. Devon was a super cool server and live Spanish guitar created the right ambience."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me by taking me here on a date night. I was so excited because I have driven by so many times and always thought to myself that I wanted to check it out. 
I was soo glad we came here! Picky vegetarian like me? I often find it extremely difficult to find one dish on a menu I enjoy. So imagine my excitement when I literally enjoyed very single dish we ordered!!! The mixed drinks were unique and tasty. 
The service was great! The wait staff was very attentive yet gave us our space and were non intrusive. 
This is such a great little spot. Perfect for a date or girls night. See pics for the dishes we got."}
{"text":"Service was not great. The waitress was visibly disappointed when we asked for food menus, and kept pushing drinks. Ordered garlic chilli mushrooms & duck flatbread. Both yummy, but flat bread definitely didn't have duck on it- almost sure it was fried ham. Very slow. Not my scene."}
{"text":"This was such a great surprise!  Met some friends for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the tapas and wine!  The smoked duck flatbread was divine, and the salads too. Really enjoyed the haloumi as well. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for drinks and music in cozy port credit! Only downside it's pretty small, other than that, great joint. Always meet awesome people here."}
{"text":"Spice Lounge is a fabulous place for food and drinks in Port Credit! 

We weren't starving so we ordered the Patatas Bravas, the artichokes, the spiced olives and the chili-garlic mushrooms. Nicely-sized dishes appeared quickly from the kitchen and we fell in love with the flavours! 

Everything was delicious. My favourites were the potatoes and the mushrooms. The potatoes were exactly how I like them. Crispy on the outside. Fluffy on the inside. And smothered in a delicious thick smoky tomato sauce. 

The mushrooms were OMG! Sautéed in olive oil, the mushroom caps were the perfect blend of salty, garlicky, spicy and I think maybe even a little sweet. Every bite was a little taste of mushroom heaven. I used the crostini that came with the dish to soak every bit of the garlicky oil. Ahhhhh!!!!! I'll be back again and again for this dish. 

My Verdict: Check Spice Lounge out! Don't let its small size fool you! The kitchen knows what they are doing. Spice Lounge is a small, cozy tapas lounge in Port Credit backlit in orange with a very cool glowing orange ceiling! Great for hanging with friends or a date night with your honey! 

Cheers! Seema"}
{"text":"Went here tonight for a girls night with my best friend. We had a good time! It was a Friday around 10pm and the atmosphere was very chilled out and relaxing - like a classy restaurant-lounge. 

I believe on other nights it may feel more bar-lounge, but not Fridays! Not too dressy but I didn't spy any t-shirt/jeans. I noticed a lot of after work customers still in their blazers. 

We split the red wine sangria jug and the cheeseboard - both were more than enough for us and so delicious! My friend didn't LOVE the cheeseboard, but I found it quite delicious. The blue cheese, fig jam and candied nuts were such a nice touch. I especially loved how their bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside - they even offer to refill it for free! 

I loved 3 out of 4 of the cheeses on the cheeseboard, and couldn't care for the one fried one they had. 

The red wine sangria wasn't too heavy or strong and had a nice fruity flavourful but not overly sugary. I really enjoyed the wine they used! 

We spent about $30 each without tip and were full off the cheeseboard and bread, and got at least 2.5-3 decent sized glasses of sangria each. Pretty decent for that price! 

I would definitely come back with my SO or in the summer with some friends/on a date! 

Highly recommend.

Notes: the place was smaller than we expected but we ended up enjoying the coziness. We also had great service from the waiter/waitress attending to us. Presentation and quality of food was top notch in my books, however my friend felt there was room for improvement (she did enjoy her experience overall though and complimented the non-cheese part of the cheeseboard). Other orders we noticed all looked delicious. They take all cards and cash and reservations as well. Friday nights just consist of lots of ins and outs of groups of people, happy atmosphere, but super laid back/non-party like. However, it's a great place to kick back a few drinks and have some laughs with friends."}
{"text":"After being informed, quite literally at the last minute, that there was a media launch going on near me, I ran, ran and ran some more from my office to the other side of Port Credit.

My destination? Spice Lounge and Tapas, a mainstay in the area. With its Spanish tapas, plentiful drinks and dark, brooding atmosphere, it's no wonder why this place is seen as the venue of choice for lushes and hipsters across south Mississauga.

I spoke about them briefly during my review of the Mississauga Mac and Cheese Festival, where they had a tent and were serving penne-style mac-and-cheese with duck confit. There was nothing quite that extravagant at the event I attended, but the food was stellar all around.

A large plate of tenderloin(?) steak was served up alongside flatbread pizza, a tray of vegetables and plenty of wine. I also had the chance to try the croquettes, which my good friend Jake says are a particular highlight of this restaurant. I'm not sure if I'm as impressed by the food as everyone else was, but the lounge more than makes up for it in style.

There's almost always live music going on in here - my former boss used to play Spanish guitar on the weekends. Anywhere you sit is a choice spot, and the menus offer quite the range of tapas items and drinks. There's a lot to choose from, almost too much. It's a perfect date spot if you're in the village.

If I have any concerns, it's that the prices on average are a bit higher than I'd usually like to pay. Most items on the menu run $10 - 13, and the portion sizes are a bit smaller-than-normal. Regardless, if you're willing to pony up the dough for it, there's a lot of selection, including the Spice Meatballs, a personal favorite.

Spice is definitely one of the true hotspots in the village, and well worth a look if you want a different (and more cozy) tapas experience.

Recommended."}
{"text":"Wonderful and diverse menu. Something (s) for everyone.  Relaxing atmosphere and well appointed bar."}
{"text":"I was here last night with a few friends for tapas and had a great experience. The tapas came out every 5 minutes or so which was spaced out perfectly. Will be going back."}
{"text":"I've become a huge advocate for all things Port Credit as of recently. The food for the most part is high quality, the business owners are friendly, personable and approachable and the venues are unique and each present something different for night life. 

No spot was as unique, on a recent restaurant crawl of the Port Credit area, as Spice Lounge & Tapas. This tiny venue located just East of the Pumphouse on Lakeshore offers something that no one else does in Port Credit, Mississauga and perhaps even the entire GTA--authentic Spanish/South American Tapas! 

The decor in here is upscale meets wine bar. Well I guess that would make it very loung-y then. I enjoyed the lighting, dimly lit (almost entirely by candle light) with red accent lighting above and around. Very intimate and cool, almost like a sexy-romantic vibe. 

No surprise that even on a Wednesday night this place was a hotspot hangout for tattooed twenty something hipsters - wait they have hipster types in the GTA?????? Heck yes! And they all hang out at Spice. Just kidding. But the place was extremely busy with a very cool younger crowd of folks for a Wednesday. I could totally see myself being a weekly regular here if I lived a touch closer. That may happen sooner than you think... (I really love Port Credit... like a lot).

We were treated to a delicious sample of their tapas menu, we were so full by the time we arrived but I vowed to rearrange my stuffing and make room for the delectable options presented to us. 

Initially we were served a flatbread with prosciutto type cured meat on top which had honey drizzled, it was sticky but tasty. I'd never considered drizzling honey on top of cured meats. Shortly after we were given a plate of Artichoke hearts done in a red sauce. It was piping hot and I love artichoke hearts so I can't say a bad word about them. The grand finale and by far the surprise of the night was the Colombian ricotta cheese balls. Deep fried. Covered in a dolce de lecce caramel sauce. Unexpected and fan-friggen-tastic!!! I'd definitely come back for this time and time again.

Sangria options were by the glass or by the pitcher. A note to those bordering on a visit to AA the \"by the glass option\" is MORE than enough for one person. See the pictures that thing was crazy huge, filled to the brim and made perfectly!

Can't wait to return - thanks for a great time. A well deserved 5 star from me!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Such a great find in port credit, not really a \"spice\" lounge though. However, if you're into tapas, this is the place for you. The dishes are absolutely yummy! The beef tenderloin skewers, beef tenderloin tacos, and chorizo were really good. Didn't really like the Serrano ham and fig flatbread; felt like I was eating jam toast than actually having flatbread. It was way too sweet. 

I'll definitely be back to try the meat and cheese platter and mussels! 


I'll definitely be back here, to try the meat and cheese platters and mussels!"}
{"text":"So - we had dropped Kid #2 at college, and decided to take the long way home through Toronto.  We got tired of the highway, and diverted to Lakeshore Road - the back roads are always so much more interesting!  It was getting to be dinner time, so we were keeping an eye out for a hotel and a good place to stop to eat.

We absolutely LOVE tapas, so when we passed through Port Credit and saw tapas we literally made a Uturn right then and headed straight for Spice Lounge & Tapas!

You know it must be good when most of the tables had reserved signs on them even at 5:00pm!  It is small, so next time we would definitely make a reservation.  But there were a few tables open so we grabbed a seat.  

Liz, our hostess/waitress, couldn't have been nicer!  She explained the menu, and gave us an idea of how much to order.  When we told her we were from out of town and looking for a hotel for the night, she even called a nearby hotel for us to check on availability!  Who does that anymore?  

We were a little disappointed that they were out of a few items, but there was plenty to choose from and a very nice wine list.

We ordered the meat and cheese plate and a bottle of Malbec. Warning:  the meat and cheese plate is HUGE!!! I mean HUGE!  It would easily feed 4 people!  The proscuitto was so creamy and delicious - it was the best I have ever had.  Two kinds of fresh cheese, olives, spiced nuts, crusty bread... what's not to love?  The plate was so big that we didn't need anything else!

Port Credit is such a cute little community - there happened to be a street fair (The BuskerFest) going on that night - and we were so lucky to stumble across this town, the fair, and a terrific restaurant.  What a great night!"}
{"text":"For years my nightly post-work watering hole, Spice has also been my go-to choice for both live music, or, a cosy evening out with a good friend. Clearly their chef cooks with my tastes in mind because I've never left so much as a crumb on my plate...or my friend's plate, if you really must know."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good.

The dishes were a bit pricy for the portions, but the food tasted good. The atmosphere is more of a date night place than a casual dinner, especially once you see the lighting which is very dark and romantic-like.

We got 3 dishes - as they didn't have about 7 different things on the menu which was slightly disappointing... Couple of the dishes we got were the beef skewers and the spicy meatballs and then we got a chicken Flatbread to start. 

Overall, I will go back here, but only for a date night, as the food portions as I mentioned are not designed for someone who is hungry.. It's more of a social setting."}
{"text":"After a serious workout, I was hungry but didn't want my workout to be a total waste so I decided to go here (hoping I can keep dinner light, it didn't happen). I arrive here with a friend and our first reaction is, how cute this area is and what we want to try next. As we enter Spice Lounge we are greeted by the server which was really nice and attentive the whole time. The inside of this small place is very intimate and the dim lighting and great lounge music sets the tone. We started off with the Sangria, you have the option red or white, we chose red. The Sangria wasn't anything special, maybe because they put a ton of ice which basically tasted like watered down wine. To start off we ordered the Grilled Halloumi Cheese, its fried cheese you can't go wrong. Then we grabbed the Pork Empanadas that came with this delicious roasted red pepper almond remesco sauce, it was simple but delicious. The couple next to us recommended the Veal Meatballs which were a hit and the featured Duck tacos, (its a hit or miss with me when it comes to duck, so I passed). Now I saved the best for last... The 10oz AAA Angus Striploin.. It was done to perfection. I can say, its the best! Call me greedy but I didn't share, well main reason is my friend doesn't eat beef so it was my lucky day! Everything just melted in my mouth and its something you will be craving. Thanks for a great recommendation from Yelp King Kris! I would've given this place a 5-star if I didn't have the Sangria but overall foods on point. I will be returning to Port Credit area soon... strictly for that Angus ;)"}
{"text":"The mushroom risotto was off. Smelled off and tasted off. Everything else was pretty good. Enjoyed the potato dish. The artichoke dish was decent, the sauce was very nice. Would recommend getting more bread to go with it. Overall a pleasant experience besides the mushroom risotto."}
{"text":"This place is nice. The service was good, and the food was great. Even though it's Tapas, ordering three plates and the cheese platter filled us up and we nibbled on the cheese plate for a bit. A dinner for two with four plates and two drinks would run you around $80-$100. Not bat at all for the quality of food.
Dislikes: 
1. The menu just said Chees Platter, without any description of what cheeses were included or what else it came with.
2. the chairs only have a foot bar on the front. I'm 6'2\" and even I couldn't touch the ground with my feet on their high chairs. Having to have both my feet in front or dangling was very uncomfortable. The tables are big enough for two to side side-by-side though so that problem is easy to solve.
3. Because the place is very small, we were so close to other couples sitting beside us that we were all practically sitting together, and practically involved in each other's conversations.

4. Parking on or around Lake Shore is always a challenge. Plan on walking for a bit. We parked almost by Hurontario and walked to the place from there.

Recommendations:
Change the chairs, get a patio, expand the place into the second floor or get a bigger place."}
{"text":"Salsa and Tapas? Yes please! I've been here numerous times with my husband and never ever been disappointed. Living in Port credit area, we just walk to \"The Spice lounge\"  if we fancy a little wee bit of drink after work and some tapas to share. 

I probably tried all the items in their menu but my favourites are :

- PEI Mussels: (in tomato sauce or white sauce) both very tasty and cooked right. 
- Red Sangria ( I usually order the pitcher)
- Chorizo ( cooked in sherry and cider)
- Empanadas ( Serrano ham and smoked cheddar) 
- Beef TacO (AAA beef tenderloin in soft taco shells with jalapeños and garlic aioli."}
{"text":"My favourite place to go to for a casual night. I love the vibe here, live music, good food and good drinks. Always good service! Would 100% recommend."}
{"text":"Spice Lounge was so good I went there twice during a three-day stay in Port Credit. Well, it could have been a combination of goodness and late hours...

To make the most of your trip to Spice Lounge here's what you need to do:
- Order a sangria. Drink. Repeat.
- Snack on Patatas Bravas and/or the beef with corn and peach salsa and/or a truffled mushroom pizza.
- Leave happy.

It seems like they have live music many nights of the week and Sundays are Sangria Sundays if you're looking for a special. The place is smallish, but it's cozy and well-suited for dates or non-dates alike. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Spice Lounge is a great spot in Port Credit - great and affordable menu with lots of variety and nice drink options, very cozy atmosphere and open late. They also has live entertainment when I was there on a Friday night.
I can honestly say that everything we ordered was delicious and the service was great, would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Nice interior atmosphere and location. I will say that the truffle mushroom croquettes were amazing! However everything else is not at all that impressive especially for the price. Live the idea of the smaller portions but if they're going be over $12 each they should at least be something worth remembering."}
{"text":"This place was the last stop on ourr Dish Crawl, and boy was it fun!

We were cramped. There was barely room for us. And by that, I meant I was sitting on a high top table in the corner of the stage. They moved away the band stuff for us.

Though we were all elbow to elbow, it was SUCH a great place. I was too full to try the prosciuttp seranno pizza, but I did get to try the ricotta desert ball.


OMFG.

SO

FREAKING

GOOD

I ate three. No lie.

SO GOOD.

SO
SO
So
GOOD.


The drinks were pretty cheap too from what I remember.


Definitely the most happening place on the lakeshore strip!"}
{"text":"I would give my experience a 3.5 - we had actually intended to go to Door FiftyFive but they were at capacity. We looked at reviews of nearby places and this one had great reviews. 
I liked the atmosphere inside, it's small cool lighting, the seating layout was a bit odd though. The staff was really nice and she ensured that the one tapa we got came dairy free. 
We had intended to come out for drinks, the drink menu looked cool. Here is a breakdown (please note these were two drinks each not four to myself lol)
Yellowbrick Road- it had a good taste, as expected off the menu description but slightly watered down
Keylime Pie - did not taste like Keylime Pie, tasted like bar lime juice and touch of vodka
Blueberry Muffin - too sweet, it did taste a bit like a blueberry muffin but again watered down version
The Equalizer - by far the best drink, delicious not watered down
For tapas we got the Artichoke Hearts - Sautéed with lemon tomato olive salsa. I really liked this dish, I have never had anything like it before. The artichoke was tender, lots of green olives (not pitted though unfortunately) super tasty. The other dish was Patatas Bravas - Spanish style potatoes? They were spicy and tasty I couldn't have the dip but it looked yummy. 
I don't know if I would come back for drinks, they were pretty mediocre but the food was good. 
The music got a bit too loud as well, it was nice when we came in then they started blasting it like it was a club. Pretty unnecessary as it just came off classier when they didn't do that."}
{"text":"First my thanks to the many Yelp reviews. They were a great help choosing from an amazing menu. 

Started with Nuts and Olives. Great starter - suggestion to staff - I was eating alone and needed a little cheese to go with salty olives. I asked for a slice of cheese. You could have sold me a $5 slice or whatever.  But, you only offered me cheese platter. 

I ordered Mussels but, they were gone - bummed. But ordered the prawns instead. NOT DISAPPOINTED!  5 or 6 pieces of greatness - great job kitchen!  

Next course Tacos - another home run!  But honestly make it two for the price!  Table order suggestion, 1.5 per person and worth every cent!  

Nice music set from a brother Scot!  

I would have had Benejlos (sp?) dessert but they were out! Bummer! Another time!  

I cannot express how impressed I was with quality of food delivered. AND LEAST NOT BE FORGOTTEN the   EXCEPTIONAL staff. 

See you on another trip!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Found due to Yelp. Wife is a vegetarian, I'm a meatatarian. Perfect for both of us! Beet salad, ribs, panko chicken, all amazing."}
{"text":"Definitely a cool lounge in port credit , great to take a date . Great drinks ..especially the sangria jugs ."}
{"text":"I would like to write a review about this place but on not to busy Saturday we arrived about 10-00 took a seat then waited and waited and waited 15 mins went by nothing.The only thing that happened was  the waiter for 10 of those minutes stood at the table next to us and chatted with a couple of patrons about movies life in general then left without a glance. As we gave up another waitress appeared who knows were from as she had not been seen for any of the time we were there. We pointed out why we were leaving and she seemed totally disinterested. Anyway to  sum up they may have good food here but good luck getting any"}
{"text":"Great cozy tapas lounge.  A very date-y type of place with several two tops and candlelit ambience with very faint lighting.  Sat at the bar height tables close to the window to do some people watching and chat it up with the neighbors.

The prawns were grill just about perfectly and the spicy tomatoey sauce was a pleasant depart from the usual butter based sauces.

The mushrooms were meaty in a throaty thick broth.

On the second round got the veggie flatbread & chorizo, which go to together like peanut butter & jelly.  

Prices were about on par with the area and passed tapas experiences.  Eat more, pay more.

*M* was a great waitress and offered up some really wine suggestions.  She was also previously in the porn industry, but behind the camera allegedly... really funny gal though."}
{"text":"The most underrated place to eat in Port Credit. Also the best Sangria in town. The staff is always so friendly and remembers your face. 5 stars hands down!!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite tapas place. I love their olives and nuts and even more so their patatas bravas. 
I cannot speak enough praises of this place. It's a small place in beautiful Port Credit. The staff are very nice and always have a smile. 
Their food speaks for itself, everything I have had has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here on a DishCrawl and it was the 4th location.  I did try everything we got but I will definitely come back when I'm not already full! :)

Flatbread with proscuitto and drizzled with honey was good - a little sweet though.
Artichoke hearts were, well, artichoke hearts.
The donut thing for dessert filled with cheese was unreal.."}
{"text":"One of our favorite date night spots! Wonderful atmosphere (intimate and perfect for a romantic evening), great tapas plates and yummy cocktails (their sangria by the pitcher is worth it alone). Cannot wait to go again!"}
{"text":"A+++++

We went for a friend's birthday dinner and this place was just PHENOMENAL! Our servers were friendly, the food was fantastic, and that white wine sangria... Oh my oh my oh my. I'll definitely be back. 
There were four of us, three boys and myself, and after a bunch of small plates we were all pretty stuffed. Here's a breakdown of what we had:

Meat and Cheese Board (4.5/5) - sooooo good. The cheese selection was amazing, the meats were pretty yummy, but it was the other fixins that stole the show! They had these candied nuts, spicy pickled veggies, super tasty olives, crusty bread, and quince paste--all were memorable.

Prawns Romesco (5/5) - Just so tasty, eat it to believe it people. 

Artichoke Hearts (4/5) - This one was great too! Although three crostinis for that whole bowl of dip? Ehhhhhhhh

Red Stag Chorizo & Cider (3.5/5) - Sausage was alright but the three crostinis made a comeback. Also, this one I just don't think is that memorable in taste, although the table side flaming action was pretty cool. 

Paella Croquettes (4/5) - totally yummy, just deep fried breaded rice goodness. Needs a tad bit more sauce though. 

All in all, I can't believe I found a gem like this in Mississauga. I'll definitely be back and I really hope you all will give this place a go!

Note: it's pretty pricy! We split the dishes and the bill still came to around $33 before tip for me."}
{"text":"Visited Spice on a snowy Saturday night (remember that weird storm of April 2018?) and the place was still busy. The weather didn't keep people away.
The food is great - I tried 4 dishes (spice nuts and olives, prawns, panko chicken, beef taco) and they were all great. I would definitely eat here again. Those four dishes with 4 or 5 drinks only came to $100. I was impressed.
The food was flavorful in a plain kind of way. There is no need to salt dishes if the food is fresh and of high quality. The panko chicken for example was juicy and delicious even though the breading wasn't savory. 
They make a good Old Fashioned and the red Sangria is decent.
The atmosphere looks really nice. It would be a really great place if you have enough people to fill it for a private party. There was one large table that was quite loud. The music got louder so others could hear it which meant the group got louder too. I'm all for loud music but it was a bit much for a small place. In no way is this a dig on Spice though.
The server was very nice and super attentive. Spice is small enough that I could look at her and send a hand signal - she knew what I was saying. :)
There is a regular DJ on Saturday nights. The music wasn't my cup of tea, but the lighting was cool."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday for dinner and everything was solid. Made reservations but it never quite filled up for the 2 -  3 hours we were there; though it did get busier later through the night. Service was attentive whole way through. 

Had the smoked duck flatbread, mussels, mushrooms.  Thought we might have to order more for the two of us but it was enough. Everything tasted good and fresh -  flavourful but not too salty, etc. Mussels were small but there were a good amount. 

Would go again, if in the area. It didn't wow me but was just consistently good on all fronts."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some nice cocktails and Tapas. Found this little gem close to my house and decided to try it out.

The place was completely packed but we were lucky to grab the last table available. Despite being a tapa place, the portions were reasonably generous, service was courteous and quick, the food was fresh, meats were succulent and the experience..... Exhilarating.

We ordered beef skewers with quinoa, seafood stew and truffle mushroom croquette. For drinks we ordered a white sangria and it was a pretty generous size. 

All in all a great experience and would love to visit this place again I just hope I am lucky enough to find a table as the place was completely packed.

They do accept reservations, so I would recommend all yelpers reading this review to book in advance and parking is a bit problematic but check the side streets, plenty of parking available there."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how incredibly well the staff at Spice handled our reservation last night which blossomed from about 25 to somewhere around SIXTY people!!!  (Sorry again Ryan!! lol) They didn't miss a beat and were so incredibly gracious and kind ensuring we were all happy despite getting SLAMMED by us for my fiancé's 40th Surprise party!  

I cannot recommend a better place for an intimate gathering with your loved one, a group of friends or even the family. I can attest to the consistency of their service and food as I also had my staff Christmas party here and it was super!  

The Tapas choices are varied and incredibly tasty!  The management and chef even went so far as to ensure they had wild caught fish on hand to prepare an \"off the menu\" request for the Birthday Boy last night!  I was really impressed with their eagerness to go out of their way to ensure we had a night to remember!

THANK YOU GUYS if you're reading this... \"you are all AWESOME!\"  Everyone had such a wonderful evening and the live music at the end of the evening was such a beautiful treat!

Spice Lounge is a class act!  So lucky to have this hot spot in our backyard!  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"A new late night lounge on Lakeshore Rd in Port Credit (MIssissauga). I was pleasantly surprised at how comfy this spot became once we settled in. At first a little small, mood lighting turned to setting \"DARK!!!\", and some funky acid-jazz playing on the radio, the bar seemed maybe too stereotypical and cheesy to enjoy... but that feeling proved wrong pretty quickly. The seating arrangement, while not a ton of it, is nevertheless roomy and comfy. Big plush leather chairs or high-tables and bar-stools for those who like to look down their glass of pinot grigio upon the rabble below. A few stools around the bar itself as well.

The service was crazy friendly and fast and helpful - in the way that ONLY a new establishment provides, so get it while it's good (let's hope it lasts awhile). They've got a handful of (mostly Irish) brews on tap, a full bar, and make their own renditions of \"sangria\"... if you're a sangria connoisseur, you'll probably find their light and funky variations off-putting, but if you're just looking for a bright and totally flavorful summer beverage, their sangria hits the mark. My party sampled both the red and white versions, and while it was clear the concoction is not made with fruit steeping at the bottom of the carafe, they still threw in some very fresh fruit into the glass for good measure. Tasty tasty tasty.

Their tequila selection was a little strange and somewhere between impressive and silly. Upon inquiry, I was told they had Jose Cuervo (the absolute worst trash you could pout the word \"tequila\" over), or their specialty import tequilas that cost upwards of 60, 80, and 100 bucks a shot depending on the grade (silver, repasado, añejo). Wanting something more in the middle, I stuck with the sangria. Also, the place advertises tapas, but I didn't see any menus or anyone else eating... nor did I inquire... so someone else will have to check on that.

Cozy, intimate, fair prices, very welcoming and fast service, this place will continue to be awesome until the Port Credit cougars take it over... (pop your head in across the street at the Harp to see what I'm talking about).

[The same owners run the equally new burger joint directly across the street, which is awesome and highly recommended! Make it a two-fer!]"}
{"text":"As a big fan of any restaurant who serves tapas, I was thrilled to find this restaurant in Port Credit. 

I love food and trying different dishes, but my eyes are generally larger than my stomach. So a place like Spice, where I can try bites of 5 or 6 different plates is a dream come true. 

This restaurant is small so make sure to make a reservation or go early. It gets busy quick, But, the atmosphere is romantic with dark lighting and close tables. A perfect place for a date!

Now, here is the reason that I continue to go back. The cheese board is INCREDIBLE! Their selection of cheese has always impressed, along with their candied nuts, fresh fruit, salty olives, and, oh the jam.  The fig jam I would purchase in buckets if it was for sale. 

I've learnt my lesson and always start with my cheese board and decide after what I still have room in my tummy for. 

The empanadas are crispy and cheesy, the smoked duck flatbread is a nice mix of sweet and savoury, and the messy ribs are stacked mountain high.

The only miss for us was the beef taco. My boyfriend is a taco fanatic and found it wasn't anything special, at a price point of $6/taco.

Anytime I find myself walking down Lakeshore in Port Credit, I find myself drawn back to this great tapas bar!

{"text":"Trying to be a tapas bar. Unfortunately the food was average. Seemed liked most of the items were deep fried. There are many other tapas style bars out there that do it better. Location is great and ambience is decent, but wish the food was better."}
{"text":"$20 for a jug of sangria on Sunday and it was amazing. That's all we went for, but we loved it. Will definitely go again to try their food!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and perfect for a date or a gathering with friends. Go on sunday for amazing Sangria prices. The tapas was all quite delicious. If you're hungry, it'll get a bit pricey though so be careful."}
{"text":"First time here, it was great. It's a tiny place though. Went on a Monday evening to celebrate a friend's birthday, it was actually livelier than we expected. Food was very good, server was great. All the food came to the table very hot. Prices were reasonable. Live entertainment was also great, however she as well as the music playing before and after her really could have been more compatible with the whole Spanish theme. Only 2 complaints: 1. The bathroom in the basement (at least the ladies) smelled horribly of mold and mildew, so off-putting. 2. Parking situation around back is annoying, got blocked in by another customer...but at least it's free parking!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here. The mushroom truffle croquettes, quinoa and chocolate cake were all great."}
{"text":"Sangria and tapas.

This shouldn't be to hard; fresh quality tapa ingredients and lots of wine should complete the picture for Spice Lounge but unfortunately the Sangria was lacking and the food was just ok. Good for the area. Nothing special in my books.

It's nice to go out to a lounge but the waitress was forgetful, they made us wait outside as they were at capacity yet enforced this rule sporadically and unfortunately Spice Lounge did not make an impression on me whatsoever. I could have saved my $150 and brought my own fruit to put in the sangria as Spice had none."}
{"text":"For those who have not made their way to Spice yet - it's well worth a visit!

I've been here a few times & it's my favorite hot spot in Port Credit. Ultra chic atmosphere, great music and not to mention busy! The staff here is always smiling and so friendly, you can tell they really enjoy being there and socializing with the crowd. There's never a dull moment!

I usually swing by for a few drinks (try their sangria!), but my most recent visit entailed an accompanying dinner, which was nothing short of delicious! It was a tapas menu so we had ordered a few things - pan fried hallumi cheese with crustini (probably my favorite; huge cheese fan!), pulled pork empanadillas (the dips are amazing!), truffled mushroom toast, and to top it all off, turdillas (pastry-like) with vanilla Ice cream and Dulce deleche.  It was just as appeasing to the eye as it was appetizing! I wish i had taken some photos, but unfortunately I devoured everything much too quickly :) 

My regards to Chef Marty for whipping up these items, the food items exceeded my expectations (I felt the need to thank him and let him know in person; very nice guy!)

If you do go by Spice, I suggest trying some of the food items - you won't be disappointed!

5-star experience (and my date wasn't so bad either)! Thank you, Spice!"}
{"text":"Dined here on a Saturday night with a bunch of my friends. The first thing I noticed is how hospitable the staff was. We ordered 8 different tapas (each ranging between $14 and $35) between a small group of 5, it wasn't as filling as we would've hoped. The variety was modest and unfortunately found none of the dishes spectacular. Would I come here again? Probably, but maybe just for drinks. The atmosphere was nice, they have special events each day of the week (the night I went, they had live Spanish guitarist). Just don't go hungry."}
{"text":"I've never been screamed at for standing and watching a football game before. A chubby guy walked up to me and screamed \"that I need to find a seat or leave\" it's a packed Saturday night.... no tables available. I tried to point to the clock w/ 1:23 left but was screamed at again. Would've loved to order a round of victory drinks. But this ruined the night. I work in the service industry and was stone sober. I was not standing in the server lane i've never been shouted at like that. This is a long drawn out white people review. But seriously screw that guy."}
{"text":"I have been going to Spice for two years now with my fiancee. We have brought so many of our friends there too and they all love it! It's a nice place for double dates. It's nice to see them getting busier and busier. We love all of their dishes and have pretty much tried the entire menu. All the dishes are sooooooo flavorful. The shrimp, beef, chorizo, potatoes dish are yummy! Usually we order about 6 dishes between the two of us are are extremely full. The mussels dish is like entre size, not just tapas size. The waiters are lovely. When it is busy, the food takes awhile to come. But the waiters are always smiling and very attentive.  Once we went impromptu and there were no table left. They told us to come back in half an hour and we did, but the table wasn't quite ready yet. We waited at the bar for ten minutes and they gave us and another couple we went with free alcoholic drinks as an apology. One of my favorite restaurants. If I weren't watching my weight, I'd go more often!"}
