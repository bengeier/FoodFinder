{"text":"Emma's is the best. I usually stop by once a week for some turkey and cheese. It's higher quality than your average deli, and the staff is great. I am also rather partial to the scones, and my family lives the bowtie salad."}
{"text":"Came here with the good intention of supporting a small business owner. The  pre made pasta, egg salad, ham etc in the case looked unappealing. Looked as if they had been sitting for a few days. The prices were overpriced., even more than market district! My kid wanted a hoggie, it was $7. I thought nothing of the price, until it came out. It was as large as the length of my hand, 5\"! So, I questioned the clerk \"owner\" was this the right order in a nice manner, the women got very nasty with me and said that's our 6\" sub! She was mad I asked. So I left, because I'm not the type of person who likes confrontation. The sub was just a turkey and nothing else on a sausage bun.  Bad experience here. It was my first time, and now my last time at Emma's!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food! I can't say enough good things. Don't miss the famous chicken salad :)"}
