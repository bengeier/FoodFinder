{"text":"This place is awesome! I love Mexican food and I'm so glad I found this place. The blackened chicken quesadilla is sooo good, they give you tons of sour cream and delicious guacamole to enjoy it with. The chips/salsa/guacamole side is a must order. They're portions are fantastic, their food is consistently delicious, and they have my favorite frothy pina colada drink. I really couldn't ask for more, I love you Habaneros ;)"}
{"text":"Hit or miss. Nice place to catch a quick bite."}
{"text":"The five stars are 100% for the food.  The service was good, we sat outside and our food came quickly.  We asked for several containers and took every little bit home with us.  I'd love to go back for the chile relleños."}
{"text":"Curiously flavorless food. Music is apparently kept at a loud volume to cover the sound of the droning fans in the kitchen area. Liquor in house margarita may have been measured in an eye dropper. Dining room is functional, but far from comfortable. Those giving this place five stars really should get out more."}
{"text":"Ok we just hiked the hard trail on Camelback Mountain and we were thirsty and super hungry...so we Yelped and found this...AWESOME food probably the best Margarita I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Just to start, I can not stand when establishments ask \"would you like chips and salsa?\" only to find that they are a charged menu item.  I understand it is only 1.29$ but that practice is extremely annoying.  

Quesidilla= its melted cheese in a tortilla...not hard to mess up.

Flautas = average

Carne Asada burrito = in the absolute top ten of the worst dishes I have EVER had in terms of mexican food.  The meat was the hardest, most difficult, leather-like cut I have had in years.  I couldn't eat it.  I know going into a mexican food place a 6.50$ burrito is a 6.50$ burrito.  However, after reading a majority of the reviews, I had seriously high hopes."}
{"text":"I am loathe to write a one star review as I prefer to remember and highlight the good experiences I've had.  However, the experience here was something that I couldn't let pass undocumented.  The drinks were the only decent thing we had and that was because the beer was in bottles, and thus unalterable.  The food was pretty bland and not tasty or even good tasting.  Unfortunately, the server was the worst example of unprofessional services I've ever seen.  Inappropriate and unnecessary interjections into our conversations, charged for \"extras\" and seemed put out by requests.  
The restaurant also just seems sort of sad, like they haven't put any money into redecorating or improvements since the early 90s."}
{"text":"Considering my boyfriend and I were the only customers in the entire restaurant, you'd think we'd have incredible service, but no we did not. While the middle aged woman (who I suspect is the owner or manager) served us with a friendly demeanor, it seemed to take forever to get our drink order, which was disgusting, we ordered pop which tasted like the machine had never been cleaned. The food was much worse though, it not only took longer than two meals should take but it tasted old and as though it had been heated in a microwave. I give this place two giant thumbs down! I never plan on returning. I recommend if people are looking for a good Mexican restaurant try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love this place. The good is fresh and they have lots of choices. Today I had a beef taco and a bean and cheese burrito. The ladies that work here are so nice and always make sure we have everything. When the weather is nice we sit on the patio with our dog."}
{"text":"We're new to Scottsdale and have had difficulty finding mexican food that tastes authentic and isn't americanized-bland.

I found Habanero's on Yelp, we tried it, and concur with the many positive reviews that this restaurant (and the one up near Airpark/Scottsdale) have received.  Very good Mexican food!  

The restaurant is definitely fast-food oriented (rather than sit down and be waited on) and while we would prefer sit down and be waited on, we will gladly order at the counter to get good Mexican food.

The food isn't bland and a little more zip can be added with some auxiliary spicy hot sauce.  

We will definitely return to this place!"}
{"text":"Incredible authentic tacos. Incredibly fresh and homemade ingredients. Their calamari and blackened tacos keep me coming back week after week. Also, very friendly service. I showed up 10 minutes after their posted closing time on a Sunday and they fired up the grill again to make me some take-out tacos."}
{"text":"Weird little spot...walk up Mexican but they serve alcohol. The food was good just a strange vibe in the place. The girls at the counter were very nice and tried to assist us in our choices."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican Food. Visiting here from Los Angeles and ordered the nachos with blacken chicken and carnitas and they were delicious! Very chill location with great food and service...highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food seems microwaved and the staff seems annoyed to be working there. I've been here a few times because I keep forgetting how bad the food is.. Hopefully by writing this I'll remember."}
{"text":"Great quick mexican food. Breakfast is awesome and the mexican beer selection is awesome. Great spot for lunch too!"}
{"text":"I found this place several months ago, and have been back every week since.  The best part is the freshness of the food.  When you order anything, it goes on the grill, which is essentially located within the dining area.  You can see everything that goes in to making your order.  I have tried just about everything, and can highly recommend the blackened fish, carnitas, and ground beef.  Whether it's in a taco, burrito or nachos.  The ground beef is surprisingly awesome.  Not your typical 'wet' ground beef.  They dry-flavor the hamburger, then grill it.  Best I have ever had.  I still need to try the blackened chicken, but having a hard time ordering something new!  Oh yeah, they make a fantastic breakfast burrito too."}
{"text":"Habanero's offers authentic, good-quality Mexican food, leaning toward the Guadalajara, Jalisco region style. I have been to both Scottsdale locations many times, as I've developed a bit of a \"taco addiction\". My favorite is the Carnitas, on either corn or flour tortilla (both are good). The Carne Asada is very good also. Everything is always tasty and consistent. Service is fast and the staff is friendly. There are a lot of casual little authentic Mexican places like this in Phoenix, but this is the best and only spots in Central/North Scottsdale for what local Mexicans call \"real\" Mexican food."}
{"text":"I love this joint. Odd place for a Mexican food restaurant but they make things fresh to order. Price is pretty good too. I will eat there anytime I am in the area. Especially the chorizo burrito.  YUM"}
{"text":"Great food. Reasonable prices. Very friendly. We were looking for a relatively quick lunch place and this hit the spot perfectly. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place was a great find! Awesome blackened shrimp tacos, in fact blackened fish and chicken as well!. Great choice of mexican beers on draft. Great service! Oh, and their habanero salsa is super good and super hot!. This place is great lunch or dinner.   Their sauce they put on their tacos is a chipotle dose of awesomeness!! 

They cook everything fresh on their grill to order but it comes out quick."}
{"text":"The Blackened Chicken Buenos Nachos were very good, and a substantial enough portion for 2 people if you want to get something else off the menu too.  I also liked the blackened fish taco I got.  I'm not too big on spice, and this had a mild kick to it, but not bad at all if you aren't super sensitive to spice like me.  Good food, good prices, and I like the TVs for watching sports when dining in."}
{"text":"I hadn't been there in a forever but we ended up for dinner there on Saturday night.  The place was dead.  The food was bland.  The vibe was lame.  On the upside, the company I was with was great - and the sangria was tasty.  I had been craving Mexican all day, and it was close by... let's just say I was left wanting..."}
{"text":"Everything is always fantastic!! The service is awesome! The stuffed jalapeños are one of my favorites, as are the lobster enchiladas!"}
{"text":"They need to open up a restaurant in Tempe. Maybe around the Mclintock and University area. Great food"}
{"text":"Garbage food! Terrible so bland! The food here is so crap, decor is harmful to the eyes. If I could rate it lower, I would."}
{"text":"really good mexican food at a decent price.
reminds me of senior taco... gotta love the horchata fountain and chilaquiles"}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Usually get the chicken fajita which is always awesome.  Solid local joint for Mexican!"}
{"text":"Been here three times. Owner has been there each time and was very nice. The food was pretty good and very inexpensive. The place is a combo of counter ordering or they will take your order at the table [maybe depending upon how busy they are - but there has only been few people when I have been there]. If you are looking for a sit-down mexican food place, this won't really serve your needs. But if you don't care and just want some good inexpensive food, you can do worse."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times over the past month, and I have to say each new item I try is my new favorite.  This place does what Mexican restaurants I grew up eating at growing up did - unpretentious, high quality honest food.  Finding the place isn't the easiest as they are literally tucked in between a sandwich shop and animal hospital, totally invisible from Scottsdale road because of the Denny's out front, but once you've found it, you don't want to go to any other \"taco shop.\"

I've tried a few different taco's, next on my list is their fried fish, can't wait.  Their carnita's they crisp up a portion when your order it, so it's a bit crispy.  Today I had something I know I'll order again; shrimp fajita burrito, enchilada style with green sauce.  To Die 4!  I've spread the word at my work as well about their very reasonable catering as we've become tired of the sandwich and pizza staples in the area.  

Check this place out, support your true local mom & pops over the other chain \"taco shop\" in the area, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We stopped here during Buskerfest for a bite to eat.  Our order seems to have been lost because other diners came and went before our order came.  We did not even get an apology or any compensation. Just \"it happens sometimes\".  The food was edible, but after such a long wait we were too hungry to really care.  We should have just stopped off at one of the stands at the festival.  To top it all off we were paying parking hourly!  There are a lot of other nice restaurants in the area, I suggest stopping somewhere else instead."}
{"text":"excellent food and service. truly feel one of the best mexican restaurants in a very competitive arena"}
{"text":"I went here with my brother, Riley H., and everything he said about me and Habaneros was true. The food was amazing and the waitress was the best we've had."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Monday, 12/7/15, first time dining at this nice casual Mexican food restaurant.   Server was attentive and our order was delivered quickly.  Guacamole was very good. Had a open faced quesadilla with guacamole- delicious.  Taco salad w/ chicken was very tasty, with guacamole.  Alcohol is served.  Very casual place with good food!  NOT expensive.  Located in Scottsdale, AZ"}
{"text":"Not your regular mex fare, super tasty, perfectly chilled beer and great service. The blackened shrimp enchilada was excellent. Highly recommended, we'll be returning soon."}
{"text":"When I first walked in, I was greeted and immediately explained the day's specials.  The restaurant was perfectly clean and open.

I ordered the house margarita, chicken quesadilla and chips. The host/server was top-rate!  She was incredibly attentive without being annoying. 

The food arrived quickly and was presented well. It was hot and had a good flavor. 

This place serves a high-quality, decent priced Mexican food meal. I would recommend a stop here."}
{"text":"Oh yeah.. Carne Asada Burrito or do I want Carnitas???  They are both so flavorful and tasty.  Yes sometimes the carnitas can be a bit greasy but its oh so yummy.  Okay, it's not Chipotle or a (fill in the blank) bertos but seems to run in the middle.  If that makes sense.  The best part of the burritos is that its just meat, guacamole, and some pico de gallo no beans.  I know they say beans are good for you but it doesn't mean I have to like them.  Besides I think there is already enough mush in the burrito with the guacamole.   =)"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. Chorizo nachos were incredible. A house Margarita for $4 that tastes great? Sign me up!

Would recommend for a casual date night. Appearances can be deceiving. Don't be put off by the lackluster dining area! Loved it and will return for more."}
{"text":"I went once, never going back. If you're going to subject your system to this kind of food, do yourself a favor and make a run for the border. Eat at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We have found one the best Mexican food restaurants in Arizona!  It has such a great mix of choices on their menu and the food is always fresh and made to order!   I love their cheese enchiladas because they are made on the spot instead of in mass quantities which have been sitting around all day.  

The staff are incredibly friendly and remember you and your name and your order within a couple of visits.  

We like to order take-out from them and it is always fresh, hot and ready when they say it will.   And our requests for multiple orders are always correct!  That is hard to find these days.   

Give them a try - I doubt you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"So here for lunch. So delicious . I had the blackened chicken and carne asada tacos . They were a bit spicy and cooked to order. Decided to have a corona to accompany my meal. Staff were great very friendly and helpful. Definitely coming back with my family!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican in town. Good food and a family business! Good drink specials and the food it legit!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. The tortillas are very fresh. My favorite is the fish taco. I have to try not to fill up on the salsa and chips though."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Monday.
Probably not a great day to go, you get left overs from the weekend.
Thanks for more latin american immigration in the last 20 years, Toronto is finally getting more authentic and good mexican and latin American restaurants. Which means, you should probably never go to a place like Hernando's unless you're going for marguaritas after work with your colleagues. 

I've only been here once. And it was for lunch. So, take this review as representative of my own experience, vs. me going there at least 3 times to get a sense of the place.

The rice was hard, obviously not fresh.
The chicken in the enchilada was dry, and also not fresh.
The beans were ok.
The corn tortillas were cold and seemingly not fresh.
Our lunch was uninspiring.
The best I can describe it as is - left overs from the weekend. Although if I had dinner on Saturday night and brought home a doggie bag and nuked it for my own lunch on Monday - I bet it would have tasted better that having lunch here after the weekend.
It's not that cheap for what it is. It's not expensive but give the meal was half rate at best, it was relatively expensive.

With St. Lawrence market so close, and so many other options in the area, I wouldn't return here for lunch any time soon. Sorry HH."}
{"text":"I give this place a 4 star primary for its habanero salsa. Definitely satisfies my spicy taste buds. 

The carne asada burrito wasn't bad either, it was extremely waterly though (probably from the guac ?).

The chucks of beef were bit large which made it hard to chew."}
{"text":"Surprised to find dive Mex in central Scottsdale.  I should have passed it by as  my burrito was cold.  It is easy to do better in this price range so I will not be back."}
{"text":"Blackened shrimp tacos on wheat tortilla made me so happy! Friendly, quick, and delicious. Amazing food for any price. I'll be back! My husband enjoyed the chicken quesadillas and my daughter the beef burrito both said their entree was delicious. I read someone said the food was just ok. I think they need to visit again because the shrimp was tender yet firm, flavorful without being over seasoned. The sauce was tasty and the produce was fresh including the guacamole."}
{"text":"I finally found a taqueria in AZ!!! I'm from CA and had been having hardest time finding really good Mexican that wasn't gourmet or a chain restaurant. I'm sooo happy I finally found a place when I'm in the mood for Mexican Food!! Their guacamole is fresh with a hint of lime and the carne asada is delicious!! I can't wait to try their burritos!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices.  They have horchata fountain and great fajitas.  Salsa is good as well and I have never had a bad thing there.  It is good for groups as well.  The service is usually super fast"}
{"text":"Good food normally. I went with lobster taco special today - not so good. Barely any lobster there, loaded with guacamole. I think I'll stick to the ground beef and calamari tacos from now on. But you have to try new things every now and then, right?"}
{"text":"Probably my worst Mexican experience in the city. Ordered the chicken enchiladas which were stale and bland and the rice tasted like microwave-cooked rice. Food had no flavour at all. The only saving grace was their hot cider which was delicious. Regardless, never going back and will not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Ordered the Parrillada for my family (feeds 3 ). Comes with potatoes, steak, chicken, carne asada and chorizo. Each person gets beans, rice and tortillas as well. You can make your own burrittos with the included sour cream and guac or eat it as a straight platter.  Solid tasting food for a decent price of $25.99 for all three of us. For something different I suggest this place."}
{"text":"I like this place. Good Mexican food and drink in an extremely casual but clean and bright atmosphere. Outside tables, too. Very friendly waitress and reasonable prices. Took off a star because they charge extra for chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Early dinner during Happy Hour. Carnitas were top notch; guacamole fresh; salsas with little taste. The place was more like a take out place with eat-in patrons served on scratched up plastic plates that look like they really can't be sanitized. The plates put a damper on the food for sure.  $3 draft beer during  HH. If you like non-distinctive beer there are 5 or 6 to choose from."}
{"text":"If you want good Cali style taqueria food this is it!! Everything had good flavor! Rice, guacamole, blackened chicken tacos, surf & turf, and the salsas were all excellent! Good service and a casual, unpretentious atmosphere was also exactly what I was looking for."}
{"text":"We tried Habaneros out a couple days ago. The staff is very friendly and the prices are spot on for the amount and type of food you get. 
The nachos are a great starter for the value. Lots of meat, beans, cheese and all the other fixings that nachos should have. The chicken fajitas were huge for $10. Not the best ones I've had considering there's no lettuce or tomato included, but not bad. Lots of peppers and onions. 
The carnitas burrito (enchilada style) is something I would definitely pass on. The meat was extremely bland and there wasn't any wet sauce that you could expect on an enchilada style burrito. 
I would give them a 3.5, but I'm rounding down because I'm not necessarily dying to go back. The quality just wasn't quite there, but at the price point it's still a value."}
{"text":"Very VERY bland! where is the flavor?
i had a xmass party for my last job there and it was definitely taco bell, heated up in a microwave *(not even an oven). the food grossed me out completely. but we were there for social reasons, plus i would assume IBM would pick the cheapest place to host the xmass party since they are such cheapos!
some girls asked me to join them for lunch today, i made a grimace but joined them nonetheless..
if they weren't such a great company, I'd be upset to tears.
20 dollars for a chicken burrito that tasted worse then taco bell. (actually Taco Bell is darn good compared to this place, at least its flavourful)

so yeah, DONT GO HERE, if you want to enjoy your food. instead take a few steps to reach the Sultan's Tent. (right across the road) its AMAZING value and experience."}
{"text":"One of my worst service experiences ever. Now I wasn't expecting a lot but...I sat for 15 minutes, nothing. Others were getting service.  So I went to counter. Took my order then served other tables...confusing. anyways I waited and waited for food. Nachos had no sour cream or cheese! They brought me sour cream but no cheese is chips not nachos."}
{"text":"Amazing service at this family run restaurant! Food was delicious and made to order. My son had the fish tacos and my husband and I shared a Parillada platter. We also had mini chimis and the jalapeño poppers for appetizers and the soppapillas and flan for dessert. All delicious! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food and staff was very friendly. Husband had blackened shrimp tacos an I had carne asada they were both yummy."}
{"text":"If you want cheap and fast Mexican food then you are better off going to Filibertos. Food is very mediocre and bland. I have no clue how people think this is quality, flavorful Mexican food. I gave 2 stars because I feel bad and I'm too nice."}
{"text":"Bomb food right here! We tend to order once every other week. They even do short notice catering. I personally love the burritos, and my wife will go with the quesadillas, both carne asada."}
{"text":"Love coming here. The food is always good and so is the service. Probably the best Mexican food in town."}
{"text":"This is Toronto's version of Tex Mex. Chili has no place with burritos. Bland veggies stuffed into a cold tortilla is not good. There is just not enough flavor. Maybe some salsa that doesn't come from No Frills would help?"}
{"text":"This is all around less than mediocre Mexican food. The guacamole greatly lacked flavor and our fajitas were mediocre at best. The tough part is that every Mexican place is this area has 4-star reviews, so it's hard to even believe there is good quality Mexican food in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Upon my first visit here, 3 yrs ago, I discovered that the menu was identical to our local Mexicali Rosa's. I was unaware that it was a chain restaurant of sorts, but I was quite pleased because I have a love of their Nachos Con Pollo. Like, unholy love. Mmm. Definitely ordered those and was not disappointed. Went with a few friends and the server was chatty with us, but not overly so. Very relaxed service, though so if you're in a hurry, you might want to say so. 

Fast forward 3 yrs and Mexi's has closed but Hernando's remains. Was reminded of its existence on my last Toronto visit and went for those yummy nachos because of that unholy love. Mmmm.  Also had a bite of my mom's chimi and that was good, too. But it's those nachos I crave."}
{"text":"Need a cold beer? margarita maybe? Have a shrimp quesadilla while you're a it! 
Friendly staff and quick service. Always an A+ experience!! Oh and the guacamole is made in house.... Just in case you were wondering!"}
{"text":"All good. Chips salsa blackened fish taco salad enchiladas burritos and margaritas. But mostly I liked this place because of the family running it and the local feel. Nice people. Nice vibe."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito this morning was inedible. The potatoes were big and unweidly and sorely undercooked. Staff was not prepared for opening 30 minutes after opening time. The cashier was still moping the floor and the cook was in the back loafing and the chairs were still upside down on the tables. Ordered chicken breakfast burrito, but chicken was heavily spiced and poor quality today and the whole burrito was a hot mess. At 6 bucks, it was clearly a ripoff."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the tacos!!! I probably grab food to go from here once a week. Love, love, love!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Love the crispy tacos here. But I must say one of the Cookes or I'm not sure if he's the owner stares you up and down. He seems like a perv. That's why I'm leaving 3 stars. Just saying ..."}
{"text":"Great people and amazing food! You'd be silly not to go there! Oh and all day breakfast means life changing breakfast burritos in the morning."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick breakfast. I ordered a chorizo, potato, egg and sausage burrioto. The lady at the front counter did have an attitude which is why I took off qla star. Restaurant clean, food came quickly"}
{"text":"Wow, what a surprise find, thanks to Yelp. They just so happened to have $3.99 margaritas on Tuesdays that were HUGE. 

I really enjoyed the Parrillada (for one) and found myself stuffed and taking home a doggie box. 

The best part of the experience is the service. Very personal, helpful, and attentive wait staff. This alone inclines me to visit again."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices! The owner is on site and made us feel right at home!
 Glad I stumbled upon it today and will be back 4sure!!"}
{"text":"Good cheap Mexican food. Nothing fancy and nothing that will knock your socks off...I mean, c'mon, this is AZ. There is lots of competition for Mexican places, so this place would be top notch anywhere else, but here, it's the best in the area for price, taste, and convenience. It's where I go for good Mexican food when I don't feel like driving to sketchy parts of central or south Phoenix (Carolina's, La Santisima, etc)"}
{"text":"Love the Lobster enchiladas; not on the menu, special item usually Saturdays. The flan is excellent. Family run business, very friendly people. Recipes have been handed down for generations."}
{"text":"Margarita slushies were okay. Big glass but not strong. Mexican Flag enchiladas and enchilada suizas were decent. I've had worse but i've also had much better. Rice was dry and refried beans were bland. $50 for 2 people. You could do better."}
{"text":"One of the best Mexican restaurants in AZ. Everything is good. We visit at least monthly and it always delivers. Love the Mexican drinks on fountain."}
{"text":"Fair prices. Local joint with good food. However, not used to paying extra for chips and dip"}
{"text":"We were pessimistic about this place.  At first blush, it appears as though it is just another chips, salsa, and sloppy burrito joint (not to say there is anything wrong with sloppy burritos), but we are consistently surprised by the quality of the food here, and the service is top notch.  Blackened fish tacos, lobster tacos, and paradilla are go to dishes."}
{"text":"If you want good authentic Mexican food come to habaneros. .this awesome family owned restaurant has some of the best food  I've tried in arizona. .service was pleasant and I found myself going back here every so often. .."}
{"text":"We stopped here because we wanted something quick and it was SO GOOD. We will definitely eat here again. Service was great too, everyone was really nice. And the guacamole is awesome!"}
{"text":"So Good!!! deliciously flavored Mexican food in North Scottsdale...a rare find. 

This place is right by the Gun Club lol.. anyways lets just say i called up in advance to pick up my order and glad I did so.. Ordered a carne asada burrito with a fried fish taco, along with 2 tostadas and the pork carnitas enchiladas for mom dukes. 

Everything had flavor and sauce was spicy not bland and mild like some places are in strip malls. The service was pleasant and very attentive to the customer didn't just eyeball me or stare when i asked for extra napkins lol. 

Ill continue to drop by... but won't eat here every week just due to my good health ha.

5 STARS"}
{"text":"Surprised we have not been here.  We visited based on the strong Yelp reviews.  We were very pleased with our dining experience.  As others have stated, the staff are very friendly and provided great service.  It appears that it is set up to be a quick serve restaurant, but for dinner we were seated and served.

I had the carnitas bowl which was great.  Pork was tender and the combo of guacamole, rice and the carnitas was tasty.  My wife had a similar entree which included tortillas.

My sons had hard shell ground beef and carne asada tacos.  Both were excellent.  The ground beef used in the tacos had quite a bit of pepper.

Overall, it was a solid dining experience and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Locally owned place with character. Good service. Excellent fish tacos and carne asada."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Omg totally feel in México when we go there. Michelada yummy my favorite. Totally recommend this place. We drive 11 miles each way - worth it-"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food. Friendly staff who move fast. Try the chicken a la Mexicana. Spicy delicious dish."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the \"fiesta rice\" was just some Uncle Ben's microwaveable rice. Service was kinda slow and I thought it was way overpriced for the quality of food that was served."}
{"text":"How is it possible I've never reviewed Habanero's - I've been coming to it (and the other location) since right after Arturo opened them.

This is my go-to place for tacos - I usually get Carnitas and Blackened Shrimp (on corn tortillas), but my other favorite is \"Kayla's Favorite\" (enchiladas with a fried egg on top).

The staff is really nice, and the food is good.  There's also a bar if you want beer or tequila with your tacos/burritos/enchilada/chilaquiles/whatever. 

Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Service is authentically welcoming. Food is authentically fantabulous! Oh, this place has some good vibes! There seemed to be a good amount of \"regulars\" which is always a good sign, especially with larger-sized familes in this economy. I had the blackened chicken nachos (okay, half an order and wish I had been with someone to share the huge portion). There was tons of chicken, fresh chopped guacamole, plus all the other yummy fixin's one would expect to find. Wash down with a fountain drink, bottled beer, or house margarita and it makes for a tasty treat!
I think I'll go back next weekend to try the breakfast menu - ole!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here frequently for about 3 months. I get the blackened chicken tacos. They are amazing! Everything else looks good also, but I just haven't gotten sick of the blackened chicken tacos yet! Delicious and seems healthy too!"}
{"text":"Great home style Mexican grub... quick, inexpensive and as good or better than most Mexican joints in the area. Fish tacos, rellenos, fajitas you name it... all good"}
{"text":"Super casual, more like a lunch spot or a place for a quick dinner. The food was good (nothing special) (had chips and chicken fajitas) but the service was very personable and prompt."}
{"text":"As someone who eats Mexican often I was disappointed with their food.  I am confused on how this place has a 4-star rating... Maybe Scottsdale people don't know good cheap Mexican? It's quick, but not authentic and good quality Mexican. I had a carne asada and calamari tacos.  The carne asada didn't have enough steak or onions on it. Mostly lettuce. The calamari was low quality and more fried breading than seafood. Although the service was friendly, I asked for corn, but got flour tortillas. Also, the chips and salsa just sucked. The verde was a little tastier, but the red salsa was not good and the chips were almost stale."}
{"text":"Blackened chicken tacos are fantastic, margaritas have some bite and the people are really friendly.  A regular stop for me every time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Really good tacos! Really bad margaritas! Just stick with the food and the beer. The calamari tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"Excellent Mahi Mahi fish tacos - blackened fish with crunchy cabbage and pico. Really cold draft beer as well.  Obviously all homemade.  Great!"}
{"text":"I work right across the street from this place and it is one of the only places that I have not gotten sick of in the 3 years I have worked were I do.  Mind you they opened a little after I started work but the point is I could always eat at this place and enjoy the food. 

 I either order the blacken chicken burrito or the blacken chicken tacos.  They are always amazing, I would recommend these to people all the time.  Everyone I have gotten them for loves them.  The chorizo breakfast burritos are also really good.  

They use fresh ingredients and make amazing food.  The owner is there all the time and a great guy as well.  If you have never eaten here I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"When in AZ, so many choices. This hidden gem didn't disappoint. Had a trio of fish beef and chicken tacos in a variety of tortillas. Yum Yum Yum! And great friendly service. Que Bueno!"}
{"text":"We came expecting a slightly more formal restaurant, but this casual set up worked for us too. They have a bar area that had more patrons at it then were sitting at the tables for food. 

They did not have to twist our arm to get us to try their margarita drink special. The margaritas were pretty average but they were cheap so that is a win in my book!  The drinks worked well with the basket of chips and 3 salsas which were delivered to the table. One of the salsas was ridiculously mild, but the green and hotter red (habanero) were tasty. Our server did a great job keeping us topped off with the two salsas that we liked. 

We ordered the lobster enchiladas and the parilladas. The lobster enchilada was not overflowing with lobster but there was enough there to let it be known that it was  present. This was my first time having parilladas, which is essentially a mixed meat fajita with pan fries thrown in for good measure. Not a huge fan of the potato addition so I will opt for straight up fajitas in the future. 

Definitely a great choice for good food in an elevated fast food setting."}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten yet this day and I was looking for an authentic type of Mexican food place but I was cruising through Scottsdale to meet with some friends later. 

I checked yelp and saw this place and some pics and though it was worth a shot since it was on the way to my destination.  I got there and it seemed alright. Checked the menu. Looked good. Chips and salsa was ala carte so that was kind of a flag for me. Attentive service and quick with getting me my order though so I figured it would be cool if the food went well. I was not impressed. I had ordered two carne asada tacos and they were just bland. Not much in terms of seasoning. Just, flavorless meat with corn tortilla and cabbage. Boring. The salsa and chips weren't particular flavorful either. I don't me myself going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito spot!! Chorizo burrito is packed full into a quality tortilla. Burro and a beer for $10, you can't go wrong. Great service, clean, good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ate the chicken fajitas yesterday for lunch, they were very good. I ordered to go, there were only 3 people working 2 cooking and 1 running the register and she was also running food to patrons. They were very busy, the lady who helped me was very nice and apologized for the wait."}
{"text":"I was excited for some tacos and realized I have over looked this place many times considering I live within walking distance.   I like that they have a bar and great Mexican beer selection along with fun Mexican sodas!

I had the fish, calamari, and chicken tacos..... they were just okay. I was hoping for more flavor. They were good so I may go back, but I am an as satisfied as I hoped."}
{"text":"Lobster tacos were a nice treat. Service friendly . Simple establishment with nice fresh food. Clean! I checked the chairs and floors. Would easily eat there again.  First impression not good as focus seems to be on alcohol with the big bar and all the booze on display. I was skeptical about ordering food but was pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I have to say that the service was very good and the food was okay.  But for the price, we thought there are better options nearby.  Chips and salsa are a la carte.  The food was not as hot as it should have been, especially since their weren't many patrons in the dining area and my wife and I ordered the same special, so timing should have been easy."}
{"text":"Good food, horrible customer service. I have been to this place three time. The carne asada was a little tough to eat but the flavor was good. The cashier/waitress seems like she hates her job, she always has a horrible attitude."}
{"text":"The food was okay enough that I would try something else on the menu before calling it quits on this place. Service was good. Lots of choices and very affordable!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Taco Bell like meal this is it... Only more expensive
Chili Rellanos greasy limp lacking flavor...
No blended frozen Margariras...Rice cold and  again no flavor....gacamole same no flavor....
Not worth the $$
Skip this restaurant Scottsdale has many more restaurants with a lot more going for them...."}
{"text":"My girlfriend, is a big fan of American-ized Mexican joints. From El Torito to even Del Taco (well, at least she can't stand Taco Bell), she loves the not so authentic stuff. Wonder what she would think of this place offering 'Canadaian-ized' Mexican?

Place was maybe 1/3 full when I came in for lunch around 1pm. I ordered the Clyde Burrito which features two styles of Beef Chili, a Con Carne and a Texas style with big chunks of brisket. It's not one of the Mission Street style ones you'd find at Chipotle or Burrito Boyz. This is more authentic style you'd eat with a fork and knife. Pretty good flavor although the refried beans that it came with might as well have come from a can from the Metro a block or so away.

Service was good at first and then my server simply ignored me for about 15 minutes and then realized he never gave me the check!

A real surprising disappointment was no free chips and salsa at your table. Is this the norm for Mexican joints in the True North? Or just Hernando's only? I was really looking forward to enjoying some during my meal and that was a disappointment.

Overall, Hernando's was OK. You'll definitely get a better burrito at Burrito Boyz but still better than most of the reviews I saw on Yelp illustrate."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time in a Saturday evening.  My wife and I shared the fajitas for 2.  Food was great, and the margaritas were strong!  The value for the price was excellent, we spent ~$40 and We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Same quality and atmosphere as their first place.  Best mexican food in North Scottsdale.  Good prices for high quality food.  Highly reccomend Kayla's Favorite with chicken and green salsa."}
{"text":"visiting from Portland,  OR area and wanted some good Mexican food.  It was so delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a place like this up north for awhile. While I still hold a sweet place in my heart for first burrito (south Scottsdale), habanero's definitely hits the spot. 

Had lunch last week including a chicken fajita burrito with voids and guac. The chips and guac were tasty and fresh. The burrito was awesome, I'm talking better than chipotle awesome. Washed it all down with a cold negro modelo. 

If you're looking for a solid, quick and tasty Mexican meal, don't miss habanero's.

Another yelp success!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here on a couple of occasions I've had the fajitas and carne asada. Both were outstanding! Their sauces are very tasty and palatable to those who can't take too spicy of foods.  

The staff is very friendly and helpful in describing their menu. And this is a very casual place and a great spot if you're looking to just grab a bite to eat and a drink or two."}
{"text":"Good food, family owned, priced right and overall a nice place to grab Mexican food at a reasonable price.  Better than those BS fake places like Ajo ALs or Macayo. This is simple, fresh and done right.
Our good to place for wanting Mexican and budget conscience."}
{"text":"Yea, this Habanero's is just as good, if not better than the original. Get the fajita dish, it's so FRESH!"}
{"text":"We made a quick decision to stop here for dinner. Happy we did! The waitress wasn't the friendliest, but the food was excellent! We live in Chandler, but will come back again for the great Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, staff is great, prices you can't beat! Definitely try the quesadillas!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing I am in here at least once a week. Great service and everyone working here is so friendly! The food is so good! I love the shrimp and fish tacos."}
{"text":"Great food-great service. This was our first time and we will definitely be back! We ordered guacamole and chips and they were great. The waitress checked on us frequently to refill our drinks. The pinto beans were wonderful."}
{"text":"Casual, cheap, delicious. Not really sure why my husband keeps dragging me to Mexican restaurants when I'm from Texas and very happy with Tex-Mex but this place is good. Service is very prompt and attentive. The HH margarita is HUGE and right on. Stuffed jalepenos (fresh, not pickled) are stuffed, fried and tasty. Padilla for 2 is generous and tasty as well."}
{"text":"I had been to Toronto for 5 days, and this was my last meal before heading out the next morning. Wow, what a way to end the week!

I had been to two other Mexican restaurants during the week...I mean of course when you think Toronto, the next thought that pops in your head is Mexican...duh. Anyways I had found this place on a whim. I was walking by my hotel and took a different street that I had not taken all week long. I came across this funky looking Mexican joint and said \"what the hell, I gained 10 lbs on this trip, let's add 5 more.\"

Upon entering you get a good feeling from this place. The vibe is just energy and a fun time. The hostess gave me a great window table. Then the waiter showed up immediately and took my drink order. I got the cocarita, which is coconut and pineapple with some Jose Cuervo. I mean since they already had water on the table, why order a non-alcoholic beverage...it is my last night here dammit!

The drink came out and was perfect...strong, but tasted great. I then ordered the salsa-queso tapas for an appetizer, which is black bean & corn salsa served with corn chips. This tasty treat comes with salsa verde and con queso dip. Awesome!

Then it is time for the main event...chicken quesadillas! Oh and another alcoholic beverage please.

The chicken quesadillas consisted of grilled flour tortilla layered with monterey Jack Pico de Gallo and shredded crispy lettuce. It is served with rice, beans and crispy tortilla chips. Mmmmmmmmmm...I may go back to Toronto now that I remember this meal being so good.

Oh and another alcoholic beverage please. Definitely check this place out, because the atmosphere is funky, the food is tasty and the staff is attentive and quick. This is Canadian Mexican food at its best!"}
{"text":"Definitely a wonderful eating experience here.

I would give the taco salad 4-stars.  The steak 5-stars. It's so well marinated and tasty.  The taco salad shell is made in-house.  I could tell from tasting it but I confirmed with them that it is the case.  The taco salad shell is so tasty and when dipped in their red salsa sauce (medium) is quite delectable.

Only bummer is that you have to ask for salsa.  They don't give it to you automatically.

The ground beef tacos 4-stars.  

The flan is 5-stars."}
{"text":"This is one of the best taco places in Phoenix. I always get the carne asada burrito, and get a side of their habanero sauce to go with it.  It's HOT, but the horchata on the soda fountain helps to cool it off. 

Super friendly staff that know my order without even having to tell them. I haven't been for happy hour (yet) but it looks like they have some great margaritas."}
{"text":"Come on Habenero's!  You can do better than this.  I've been eating at your orginal location for years and my office has been eating at this location since it opened in 2012.

Your prices keep increasing and your portions continue to decrease.  Getting salsa with an order seems to be a true put out and when you do, the size of the container is so small, there's hardly any in it.  An order of chips and salsa is almost $2.00 for slightly over a tablespoon of salsa?  Today we called in an order - ordered steak fajitas, got beef flautas, my shrimp quesadilla honestly had 1 little shrimp in one entire quarter of the quesadilla and hardly no cheese and the guac was brown.  I know you guys are a family owned business and you deserve to make money, but go ahead and raise the prices to a comfortable level, then don't skip on the ingredients.  You can't continue to cut ingredients and raise prices without also losing long time customers.   Had this been my first visit, I would never go back."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on yelp and then eating there I am losing my faith in the collective wisdom of yelp.
First the chips and salsa; very bland and watered down salsa. Next the chille relleno; tasteless. I have had better tasting Mexican food in Berlin, Germany. 
Service was friendly and a good Margarita. Inecpensive as well."}
{"text":"After driving over 200 miles since breakfast in Tuba City, my family and I were ravenous. Since my dad was craving Mexican food, we stopped by Habanero's for lunch. 

I'm not a Mexican food expert by any means, but I feel like I've had my fair share of great tacos in my time, and these were so good!! I had 3, the blacked fish, lobster, and carne asada and would have to say that the lobster and carne asada were my favorites, while the blackened fish felt on the blander side. 

The service is super friendly, and the food reached us pretty quickly, so overall, definitely happy with my experience!"}
{"text":"The place was clean, but the food wasn't very good. Maybe my expectations of Mexican food are too high, but this food wasn't worth what we paid for it."}
{"text":"You know what Mexican food joints really lack in these days? Hot sauce. Habanero's, however, definitely does not! This hot sauce is bomb as fekk. Got a steak n egg burrito. Naturally. Steak is fantastic and cooked fully, nice presentation, and served right to your table. Cooked quickly too. 

Great atmosphere.. college football and basketball on tv, full bar, plenty of seeing, well kept.. there's no wonder why Habanero's is still open out here, nearby to so many bars and clubs! 

Definitely recommended. Try the habanero sauce.. spicy yet sweet and delicious!"}
{"text":"Easy 5 star. Was looking for a mexican place near work that wasn't chipotle. Felt like I was taking a gamble when I saw the place but it turned out to be very delicious. 

Simple build your own burrito, tacos, enchiladas menu. 

Ingredients were fresh and wholesome. 

Service was great.

Can't wait to come back to my new favorite place to grab lunch!"}
{"text":"Habaneros had various reviews from the people in our group. That is why  I am giving it a 3- star rating. 

The tastiest entree was  definitely the chicken fajitas. The chicken was tender, along with many veggies and tortillas.  The blackened fish taco was also a yummy treat. 

The most disappointing entree was the enchiladas with red chili.  It actually tastes like prepared chili from a can. The middle of the road entree was the beef and bean burrito, not smothered. 

We did enjoy the chips and salsa and the sopapillas, which were an additional cost."}
{"text":"What Mexican restaurant doesn't have QUESO? Come on. 
Chips and salsa also are a charge?!? 
That's the first I have ever experienced and I'm from Texas-the known Tex Mex place to be! 

I will say my Mahi Mahi was good, but would I recommend this place ... probably not."}
{"text":"Overall not impressed. My chile rellano was really greasy and the guy cooking was touching everything with the same gloves he was making the food with. I thought the portion was a little small for the price."}
{"text":"I wished they would have just turned us away when we came at 2pm when they were closing in 30 mins.  I was hungry after swimming laps, this was the closest Mexican restaurant from the Cactus pool. I noticed they were closing shortly but came in anyway and they said okay to come in, (while I believe they really didn't want to).

There were no other customers on Sunday afternoon, I quickly ordered a cold glass of beer and two types of tacos (fish and lobster). They brought two tacos pretty quick. I started with lobster tacos and they were good, but fish tacos was pretty plain and fish was dry. I tasted my friend's dish but that was just okay too. Nothing great to make me want to come back here again.

As soon as they served food, they started cleaning, as if they are telling us hurry up and leave. We left before 2:30pm before their official closing time.  I guess since there were no other customers, they thought they could leave early. So I wished they would have just turned away when we walked in. I didn't want to feel rushed out."}
{"text":"Outstanding fast Mexican food!  Love their salsa especially the habanero.  Good fast and friendly.  Always stop in here a few times when I'm in the area"}
{"text":"A decent Mexican joint by Toronto standards.  It was pretty empty when we walked in there, and despite this, service left a lot to be desired.  The servings were plentiful and reasonably tasty, while the drinks were quite potent and left us with a nice buzz.  We only happened to stop in because we were in the neighborhood and it is unlikely we would go back unless we really had the craving for Mexican and didn't want to cut across town to Kensington Market."}
{"text":"Low price, GREAT food. Awesome find. Here for quick lunch and am shocked at how great the quality of the food is. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time food was awesome! I would definitely go back the only let down was the service was kind of crummy, there server did not seem like she wanted to be there... maybe it was an off night or something"}
{"text":"Awesome small local diner.  Family run with aunts and uncles, etc. operating all areas.  Everyone seemed to know each other and had a very warm feel to it.  Started with guacamole and chips, 2 kinds of salsa were good, but asked for extra hot and enjoyed that as well.  Other reviewers recommended the Parrillada and it was wonderful.  A combination of chicken, steak, chorizo and carnitas with all of the fixings to put into your choice of tortillas, fajita style.  We polished off this huge dish and both agreed it was one of the best mexican dinners we had had anywhere."}
{"text":"One of those great places tucked away in a corner! I had the blackened shrimp fajitas and they were outstanding. The guacamole and sour cream were both fresh and delicious. I am definitely coming here again!!"}
{"text":"Habanero's never disappoints! Truly authentic food, everything is made to order. Good menu selection and workers are always pleasant. Family owned and run which stands out in quality and service."}
{"text":"It's in a strip mall.

Falling my guideline of don't be afraid of strip mall food, we gave it a try.

Menu was simple enough.   Ordered my food and a Mexican soda.   Was given a cup and to my delight they had a soda vending get machine with all sorts of Mexican sodas!   I believe I started with Horchata....not as good as the stuff I get from my regular haunt, but it was good enough for seconds.

Food soon was delivered.  Very nice also.   Will have to add the place to my visit next list."}
{"text":"If you have not been here one word...GO! It's the real deal. Awesome food, great prices and super nice (family run!!) people. Forget Chipotle...have some real Mexican food! 

Drew"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for Mexican food ordered the way you want it. The staff is super friendly and the portions are decent and filling!"}
{"text":"Love coming here! Friendly service and yummy food. Definitely recommend the Carnitas Tacos. Always a nice relaxed choice for breakfast, lunch, or even dinner :)"}
{"text":"Solid choice for Mexican food, friendly service.

I came to Habanero's on a date, as a quick place to eat before going to do something else. It was perfect for that purpose.There was plenty of seating, so we got a table immediately. When I first walked in, I thought that the setup of the place was such that you order up front, but it was a full service meal. The kitchen is open, so you can see what's cooking back there.

The service was friendly, the restaurant was clean.

As for the food, I was pretty impressed. We ordered the parrillada for 2, so we got a really good mix of what the place has to offer. The meal comes out on a plate for the guacamole, sour cream, beans (of which you have a choice of refried or black), and rice and a little grill for all of the meat. And there was a lot of meat! There was chicken, chorizo, steak, and carnitas on this plate. You also get your choice of tortillas (corn, flour, or wheat). On both the tortillas and the beans, we got to choose separately, so we had some corn and wheat tortillas.

The meat was all great! Juicy and tender, it all made for good tacos. Add a little guacamole and some of the salsa, and this is some tasty food.

I'll definitely come back, and I'll likely find it difficult to order something other than the parrillada. It's a great option!"}
{"text":"Hell yeah!
Easy, fast, inexpensive and delicious!
The Parrillada is impossible to pronounce, but it's a must!"}
{"text":"After several successes at the Yonge Street location (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/hernandos-hideaway-toronto), I was always hoping to go to the one on Front Street.  Same owners, so you'd expect the food to be equally fresh, tasty, and worth going to.  Sadly, the best I can say is it's adequate.

If you can't venture north on Yonge, this will do, but this Hernando's is a pale comparison to its sister restaurant.  Probably one of the reasons is this one is above street level, not below.  This you'd think is a small point, but it doesn't have the closeness and snug feeling of the other location.  It's bright, open, and just feels to family-friendly when comparing (albeit perhaps unfairly) to the other.  The food doesn't seem to have the same draw or success to that of the other location, but this may be psychosomatic.  I can't put my finger on it, but myself, and others before me, don't like it as much as the other.  Take the subway north."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing fajita burrito. Does not taste like fast food one bit, but priced as such. The sauce they use tastes amazing, and their veggies are fresh and make the dish. Their habanero and mild hot sauce are also very good. Fast, courteous service."}
{"text":"WAS WONDERFUL! Food was very fresh and had great taste! Just a hair more expensive than Chipotle but much much better! We will return"}
{"text":"There are no better tacos anywhere when n it comes to blackened shrimp tacos (tell em to go lighter on the onions if you don't  love onions)  great family owned spot and this family's favorite Mexican food spot. Carnitas  is outstanding as well."}
{"text":"I have dinned at many Mexican restaurants, shack's, etc. and enjoyed the food so much but this place misses the mark! The Chicken enchilada had a weird taste and after taste and seemed dry and too old. The beef taco was mediocre and the beans had some foreign object in them. I will never eat here again even though the staff seemed nice. Shame on you!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican Diner. Service and personnel very friendly. Fast service with great food. Had the Parillida for 2. Lots of foods for 2. Chips and Salsa was good. Didn't know we went during happy hour and draft beers were $2.99. Total bill with tip $30. Worth every penny. Will be back when we are in town."}
{"text":"This is one of our usual takeaway (to-go) restaurants when we are watching a movie at home! The food is nothing fancy; just simple, inexpensive but really tasty! My favorite is the blackened shrimp burrito bowl!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and it was pretty terrible. I ordered the blackened fish salad. Literally, there was about 2 ounces of fish. The rest was a weird mixture of warm onions and pepper on top of salad greens. The greens instantly became wet, warm, and soggy. Overall, a very weird and gross dish.  To make matters worse, the place is extremely noisy inside. It's basically cafeteria style where you order at the counter.  They even have the little cafeteria trays. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I will give them the benefit of a doubt that perhaps the tacos are halfway decent.  I definitely won't be back to find out. Lots of great places to have lunch in Scottsdale. No need to waste $15 on this place."}
{"text":"Would definitely return. Excellent tacos- lobster & shrimp were impressive. Fish was tasty. Habanero sauce was quality. The green sauce is more my style but red was also yummy.

Service was better than expected."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for a small taqueria.  The food was well prepared, tasty and also well presented."}
{"text":"Holy Guacamole batman that was a big surprise.  I don't do 5 star reviews much, but Habanero's gets one.  I had the lobster and blackened fish tacos and bravo well done, some of the best I've had.  I've eaten plenty of tacos from North to South and East to West and a few in Mexico.  I would add that it should come with guacamole, I had some ordered separately.    Fajitas were good as well.  Service was delightful."}
{"text":"Searched Yelp for a Mexican restaurant as we were driving. TheYelpers were spot on.  

Two people for lunch and we shared the Parrillada for two, with shrimp.  Very tasty.  I had corn tortillas and the partner had wheat. Both were tasty. It is similar to fajitas but this was better.

The steak, carnitas and chicken were good.  The chicken was the best of the
three. The chorizo was outstanding.  Even included onions and potatoes.

I am from the east coast so not sure when I will get back.  But certainly will add it to my hit list. 

Lunch - no table service but they do come by often.  Dinner does have full table service."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Great food made to order (and fresh.)  Wide variety of Sonoran style Mexican food.  I like the new place.  A little more room that the original store.  Good choice of hot sauce to compliment the cuisine.  I consider this a staple in my diet."}
{"text":"I had a carne asada taco and carnitas taco. Both were pretty bland. Don't know what they were marinated in, but not much flavor. The red and green salsas are also mediocre. Would not go back and wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Maybe I came on an off day, but my food at Habanero's was bleh.  I mean, it was edible, but lacked flavor.  I ordered the blackened shrimp tacos and might as well had just boiled shrimp with a little blackened color.  I have friends who love this place, but based on this experience I have no inclination to go back and give it a second go."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a very tasty lunch. She had the blackened fish burrito and I had two chicken tacos. The burrito was excellent as were the tacos. The sauce they cook the chicken in tastes great. Just a footnote the tacos come with a lot of onions so if onions aren't your thing you need to let them know when ordering."}
{"text":"Excellent... Reasonable pricing.  I had blackened shrimp, blackened chicken, plus mahi mahi tacos...Mmmmm. My wife had the fajitas also excellent. We  will come back here again during out two week vacation."}
{"text":"I stop by here everytime I'm in Scottsdale. Guac is fantastic. I'm not a big chicken fan ( and it's always recommended to me) so the enchiladas and blackened shrimp are my go to. Atmosphere is nothing fancy, service has always been super friendly and fast. If only we could get rid of the styrofoam cups. I guess you could just order alcohol:)"}
{"text":"Very good, fresh, authentic food that is prepard and served by a really nice family. This place is very informal. Exactly what I don't expect in Scottsdale. Bonus: All beers on tap are Mexican."}
{"text":"We eat here weekly. The food is fresh and not loaded with sauce.  Kayla's favorite is great and I love all of the fish tacos.  Leave room for the flan.  It is not fancy the atmosphere is simple. Family owned."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The food is authentic, extremely fresh and homemade, including the salsas and pico de gallo. And it's relatively healthy--not greasy at all. Did I mention inexpensive? I paid $7.25 for a large shrimp fajita burrito. I'll be coming here on the regular! Really great service as well :)"}
{"text":"Indifferent service. Lame, tasteless, dried-out food that tasted like it was cooked for an hour, and then sat under a heat lamp for another hour. Steer clear, steer clear!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I come here with my family once but will come back. Thank you! I love it all. My sister ate a quesadilla for the first time in two years and she flipped. She was in Korea. We had one of the best waitresses also. I love it!"}
{"text":"Counter style.  Okay place.
Good beer.  I was looking for something slightly with more ambiance.

Good for quick lunch.

One of the first places to have Corona Light Draft.

Sweet waitress."}
{"text":"First time there.  Food was tasty, though portions a bit small and very reasonable prices.  Friendly service and nice seeing them busy.  Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"At Habanero's your food will be fresh, hot, and authentic.  The wait staff here is phenomenal and the owner can be not only visible, but also charismatic with guests.  My husband and I will drive 30 minutes from our house out west just for a one-of-a-kind Fajita Burrito.  The prices are extremely reasonable and their happy hour will put a smile on anyone's face."}
{"text":"Always fresh, delicious and reasonable prices! Friendly servers and food comes fast! Probably my favorite mexican food in Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around!! 
Great margaritas and friendly staff!! 
Blacken Quesadilla is my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"I love Habanero's! Great service, awesome quality of every menu item and exceptional staff. I always order the Fajita burrito or the special of the day! Always great!
The chips and guacamole are tasty and fresh! Stop in to experience great mexican food!"}
{"text":"I entered the empty (5pm) restaurant and ordered a blackened chicken burrito. I very much enjoyed the burrito and the hot (habenero) sauce I was able to pour over my burrito. Amazingly spicy but a delicious flavor!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the North Scottsdale location when I worked by it. I hadn't been back to Habanero's in a few years... it kind of fell off my radar. I recently returned after having a taco craving and remembered why we used to go here for lunch. You order each taco a la carte so you can mix and match. Their blackened shrimp tacos are delicious, but spicy... at least for me. My favorite was the carnitas taco. They give you a ton of guacamole and it's so flavorful. In the past, I remember ordering at the counter. This time, we were seated and ordered at our table. I'm not sure if this is what they always do or just during dinner. Overall, the prices are great and the food is delicious. I definitely won't forget about Habanero's next time I have a taco craving... which is at least once a week."}
{"text":"Family and I will come here about once a week. We've tried tacos, quesadilla, burritos and Fajitas. All delicious!
Service is also good and pretty fast, making it an easy option."}
{"text":"I am new to town and was looking for a New Mexican place for lunch. This place exceeded my expectations and was very quick with our orders. Great service, very clean and the employees were very friendly and accommodating. It reminded me of the Mexican food back home which was unexpected. It was packed so that's how you know it is a hidden gem. I will definitely be returning soon to check out their margaritas. Keep up the wonderful job guys!"}
{"text":"Okay, I left a perfectly good, little pub because my sister swore that she knew people who got food poisoning from it, to come here...and get food poisoning. 

NOW, I just want to state that I cannot CONFIRM that it was this place that gave it to me, but let's just say that I had only eaten finger foods at a bridal shower prior to coming here and shortly after dinner I got sick in the middle of a concert. Super fun AND convenient!

The service was good and this is why this place got the extra star. The guy was truly nice and the service quite fast. 

You wouldn't think the food would make you sick, because it was very bland.  Tasted like something I could have made myself very easily. I ordered the chicken burrito and I found it was quite dry. THey didn't include any sour cream or guacamole, even on the side, so it was just rice and beans and chicken. 

The atmosphere was cute enough, so perhaps as a place to go after work for drinks, but be wary."}
{"text":"I ordered food to-go. I got the enchiladas with beans and rice. Totally tasteless. Chips were stale and not seasoned or salted at all. Really disappointed, as I wanted to like this place since it is so close to my home. Won't be wasting my money here again."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much...being in a strip mall but the food is great. We arrived on a week night and there were plenty of seats. The service was good and the food was excellent. I ordered the chicken tacos and they were loaded with plenty of food. Real, authentic Mexican food and for the right price."}
{"text":"The only place that has the most amazing fish tacos ever! Great place. It's a little hole in the wall tucked back where it is, most drive by and don't  know it's there!"}
{"text":"The food here has it's good days and bad days.  I've had amazing meals here and I've hand mediocre ones.  
BUT... the drinks are the best.  Quite possibly the best Mango Margarita in Toronto.  And although the vibe and the restaurant may sometimes seem a little low key, it doesn't take much to change that.  If your with some great people it can be a lot of fun... like you rented the place out for you and your pals!  The wait staff is very funny and personable and almost join in.  I love the open window in place of a patio.  I think its better because you get to look out at all the people, and not feel like your on display for everyone on the sidewalk.

If your looking for a place for you and your friends to \"take over\" and not have to worry about seating than I would go here.  And if you're worried about the food then just stick to the nachos (always a safe bet), but don't miss the margarita's or sangria."}
{"text":"Came here looking for Mexican breakfast. Awesome food and hot sauce !!!! Will be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I love this place! Eaten here at least 5 times. Food quality is way above its price point. Eaten & recommend: quesadilla, fajitas, burritos."}
{"text":"I hate it when we are on vacation and we waste a meal on anywhere that isn't amazing. This place was not amazing. It was just barely okay. The Guac was just crushed avocados, there was no real salsa, and it was nothing like I was expecting after reading some of the reviews. 

I did like the tortilla surrounding my very dry burrito. The blackened fish was also very tasty, but I didn't enjoy the meal as much as I had hoped. 

I have to say the staff were very friendly, but that didn't make up for the food.

Maybe Californian Mexican food has spoiled me. This is another place I'll never go to again. Feeling quite disappointed. I wish we'd gone to the Old Tortilla Factory, but the Yelp reviews put us off. Maybe we'll ignore the reviews and check it out tomorrow... It's got to be better than this, surely???"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to try Habanero's and wasn't too sure what to expect. A dive or what? As we walked into the doors the dining area was huge. Very nicely decorated. Little confused cause the dining area was so nice it almost felt like a sit down place but dumb me they have ordering counter. 

Me and my daughter ordered the same thing. Carne asada burrito and a side of chips. The side of chips comes with two salsa. A red and green salsa. Really like the red but the green seemed a little sour to me. Just to clarify I liked both. The carne asada burrito was really good. Nice moist and juicy meat with guacamole, Pico de gallo, and Jalapenos. So it had a nice little kick to it. Not too hot but just right. 

I was very surprised by the service. They bring your food to your table and I even had a few people ask us if the food was okay. That's a nice touch for a place like this. They even thanked us for coming in as we left. Very nice. 

Food was good, great service and friendly. Let me see, I think i will be back. Quick food and friendly people. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This is a great option for happy hour drinks but not for food. The Kayla's Favorite item on the breakfast menu sounded promising, but their eggs were not cooked well and the enchiladas were bland."}
{"text":"This place was GOOD. The salsa was a little flavorless, but the chips were awesome, the tortillas were fresh and the blackened fish tacos were seriously delicious. The blackened fish was particularly spicy, but as long as I had a sip of water afterward, it didn't bother me too much (I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to hot stuff). We will be visiting again. 

The staff was friendly and the restaurant was nice and clean. Big fan."}
{"text":"I love this place! You have to try the carnitas!
Perfect for a laid back spot to grab something to eat or for Togo."}
{"text":"I eat here relatively frequently.  That alone says something.  Everything here is solid, but some dishes truly stand out.  Tops among them is the Parrillada.  That dish is unique and comes with potatoes, onions, chicken, steak, chorizo and carnitas.  On the side is beans (pinto or black, your choice), rice, sour cream and guacamole.  Order an extra 2 tortillas (comes with 3) when you get this as unless your fajita making skills are vastly superior to mine (which would not be difficult), you won't finish this meal in 3 tortillas.  I eat it with the habenero sauce which is very tasty and spicy.  As another reviewer mentioned, the guacamole is not going to be the most spectacular, \"eat it plain with nothing but a chip, table-side type variety\" that you've ever had. But it's good fresh avacado that provides a nice creaminess and pairs nicely with the rest of the dish.  And... they won't charge you $1.95 extra to get some.
Another dish I like is their nachos.  I get blackened chicken, sometimes with chorizo.  That option is not on the menu, but they'll make it if you ask.  It comes with pinto beans which will make some of the chips soggy.  If that's a problem, request it \"no beans, extra cheese\".  It comes with real cheese (two types) and none of that nacho cheese whiz crap that other places insist on foisting upon unsuspecting customers.  Other dishes I've had are the quesadilla (shrimp), the breakfast burrito (chorizo) and the revoltura (another breakfast dish).  I've enjoyed them all.  But, if I were to recommend 1 dish, it's the Parrillada.  It's the most unique dish on their menu and what keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"I must start by saying I can eat Mexican food everyday! I really enjoy me some tasty Mexican food!! I found them on yelp one day I was craving some & to my surprise they are around the corner from office-woo-hoo!!  I ordered ahead and it was ready when I got there, super easy and convenient. 

I ordered chicken enchiladas & my friend chimichanga. Both were delicious & we enjoyed our lunch! Definitely will be back, found our new Mexican food spot!"}
{"text":"Pretty good quick Mexican food, stopped here based on the recommendation from the clerk at the as station. Never thought I would say that but was worth the stop.

Asked the server what was good, she recommended the mixed plate...shrimp, beef, chicken etc...good stuff I will be back"}
{"text":"Yes! Don't let the location of a strip mall fool you. Very good Mexican food! The menu is not huge but what they do they do well. Try the blackened shrimp or fish tacos. Also the Jamaica juice was delish. It's a casual/simple restaurant with good fare!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for lunch over the past few months and I finally decided it was time to write a review. Habanero's is definitely a nice little spot for lunch, it's quick but the food is made fresh. Being a Mexican food fanatic I know good Mexican food and this is definitely it. Everything on the menu is fairly inexpensive but the portions are a good size, I always leave feeling satisfied. 

My favorite item on the menu is the blackened fish taco salad, it has everything you could ever want on a taco salad from tasty guacamole to satisfying rice and beans. The blackened fish is absolutely amazing, it's cooked to perfection. I highly recommend anything on the menu that has the blackened fish. 

Today I decided to try something a little different. I ordered the a la Mexicana with chicken. It's juicy marinated chicken sautéed with jalapeños and onions, it also comes with a side of rice and beans and warm flour tortillas. I definitely wasn't disappointed. The chicken was flavorful and grilled to perfection. I made tacos out of the chicken, rice and beans and then covered them with the habanero salsa. The habanero salsa gave the tacos a big kick, but it was worth my mouth being on fire for the remainder of my lunch break.

The only reason that I gave Habanero's 4 stars is because I'm not the biggest fan of their salsa. I am a salsa connoisseur (you probably didn't know there was such a thing lol), so I am quite critical when it comes to salsa. They have 3 kinds of salsa, verde (mild), red (medium) and habanero (very hot!). All of their salsas are very thin, they have more of a hot sauce consistency. While the salsas do taste good mixed in with your meal they aren't really ideal for chips and salsa but it all depends on what kind of salsa consistency you prefer. 

Overall the food is delicious, the staff is very friendly and the service is wonderful! I will definitely become a regular!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service tonight . Time and time again we call the order in and they never get it right! We have noticed there are several consistent crews. DO NOT GO WED OR SUNDAY. This woman should not be serving the public.  However, if you go Tuesday or Friday, the crew is pleasant and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"Came in because I was nearby that day for work. It was this or subway. Definitely got more than I expected! Service was great and good came super quick. I've had plenty of chicken burritos all over the southwest but the blackened chicken burrito here is the best I've ever had. Hands down. That thing made my day. A friend had the bean and cheese burrito and said the same thing. Give it a try if you're looking for some quick quality Mexican/ southwestern food"}
{"text":"Blackened chicken here is tasty. Had in a taco and on nachos. Carne Asada taco was ok not great. Good casual neighborhood Mexican spot"}
{"text":"Good place for authentic food. It's a fun environment and friendly service. The blackened chicken burrito I ordered was excellent. However, both the chips and salsa weren't very good in my opinion. But overall a good family fun restaurant."}
{"text":"Believe it or not, I've not found a lot of good mexican restaurants in this area.   I've tried Habanero's a few times and have enjoyed each experience.   A little on the pricey side and I\"ve stuck with the basics so far....I plan to try it some more and explore the menu a bit and will update as I do."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a step up from the same old bertos style fast Mexican places. I think the food seems much better quality and you have better options if you want something more. There is also plenty of room to dine in, as this isn't as much of a to go place as most fast taco shops. 

The service here is fantastic. The cashiers and cooks have always been super friendly. You order at the front and then they'll deliver your food to you, so it's not super fancy or anything, but they are still attentive to their customers. Even while dining they have always checked on our table and cleared plates if needed. 

They have some amazing specials, I would always recommend ordering them if they sound good to you. From their tacos, to shrimp quesadillas, to just the chips, rice and beans, this place is phenomenal, especially for the value. It's casual but satisfying and filling. 

They also serve alcohol and have a few seats a bar up front. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"We love this place so much. We come here a few times a month. It's family owned and operated. The food is consistently good. The tacos are excellent, the taco salad is fantastic. We adore the flan. The drinks are great. The price is totally worth it. It's just good food, fun lively atmosphere."}
{"text":"I I have been wanting to  try this place for a long time! It was very busy on a Friday night and very loud but I was able to find one empty table and the food was good so that made up for the loud environment!! The staff were all very attentive and helpful! The tacos were good, not \" out of this world\" but pretty great anyway!! It's very reasonable priced I would say.. I love that they bring two different kinds of salsa with chips! The green was my favorite. If I come again I would maybe try something different on the menu."}
{"text":"Solid, but lacking that little something that could make a spot like this special.

We started off with chips and salsa. Liked the multicolored chips, but they were a little stale and served cold. Made me a little sentimental about the chips at Blue Burrito which used to be located nearby. Served with green and red salsas that could be characterized as Scottsdale bland.

We opted for a couple of tacos and a quesadilla. The blackened chicken quesadilla was definitely the highlight of the meal, but the tacos. a carne asada and a blackened chicken, were just average. Disappointing also in that my request for two types of tortillas was not honored. The whole wheat tortillas were thin and dry, good for me I suppose, but nothing special and not what I ordered. The chicken taco also had quite a runoff of mystery fluid that filled my basket, a major taco pet peeve of mine. I'd also appreciate easier access to some salsa to help doctor the tacos as needed, not just a bottle of pepper sauce on the table.

No kids with us on this visit, but they do have chicken fingers ($4.99) and Cheese Quesadillas ($4.50) served with a choice of rice, beans or fries for children. No drink included.

They also serve alcohol, with a happy hour from 3-6 p.m. weekdays. They serve domestic and imported beers, as well as a house margarita and other specialty drinks. 

Ordering can be a bit slow, as we fell in behind some carryout orders at the counter on this visit, but service is quick once an order is placed. 

The staff here is always nice. I suspect if I ate here more often my review would gradually become more glowing just because of their friendly attitude. I will definitely come back. Just not that often with so many other good Mexican grills and restaurants available in metro Phoenix."}
{"text":"Just great authentic Mexican food! Also I didn't know that you could have your flour tortillas made chimichanga style..don't laugh, I apparently lived a sheltered life about this. The woman behind the counter was friendly and helpful. The dining area was clean and plenty of parking. Check this place out if you have the craving."}
{"text":"The reviews are true this place has fresh food and great service. Not a lot of salt and lard. The guacamole was dynamite! Just wish the salsa had a little more kick! The flan was delicious. A locals place."}
{"text":"My husband had the better of our two meals.  Very flavorful beef fajitas.  I had blackened shrimp tacos that were heavier on the pico de gallo than the shrimp.  House margarita was a little too sweet.  Friendly service.  Not a bad meal just not something I would seek out."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! The happy hour is amazing and their food never disappoints. For being in Scottsdale, Habanero's has a simple, warm Mexican food feel to it. None of the flash of Scottsdale, just amazing flavor. I highly recommend the bean and chorizo dip as an appetizer. It is seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten. Love the family feel and the amazing prices. Such a delicious deal!"}
{"text":"Great place! Good service, family owned, good margaritas, fish tacos and fajitas! Going to make this place our new local Mexican joint for sure!"}
{"text":"Ole! My first time at Habanero's and l was pleased!  I ordered a blackened fish burrito, hubby picked the chicken taco. I was offered three salsas, spiced, spicy and green. They were all excellent, the spicy one got my attention. We were quickly served and we loved our quick bite!  

Staff is very friendly and efficient, l definitely recommend it.  They have catering services too."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. The only drawback is the lousy plastic plates, but overall I would definitely recommend this place for the food quality."}
{"text":"This place is a hole in the wall with great burritos (try the carne arsadi) or the quesadillas. They also make their own chips! The manager is a darling girl who answers the phone, makes the grande  margaritas (looks like you only get a splash of tequila in it however), busses tables, takes orders, washes dishes and has a smile on her face the whole time. She isn't the owner but she sure works like she is- sports on tv and everyone is having a good time!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"7 minutes sitting. Waitress serving all tables around me. No greeting no water no menu. What did I do wrong?"}
{"text":"Five stars for it being my favorite Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale!  I was beginning to lose hope I'd never find good Mexican food.  Thank goodness for Habanero's!

It's definitely one of those great places that will never do you any wrong by ordering today's thing.  Both times I've been here I've ordered from that separate menu item.  First time, I ordered the Blackened Chicken & Relleno burrito that was served Enchilada-style...and was saddened by the reality that I had finished eating this burrito.  The next time, I ordered the Surf & Turf burrito and loved it almost as much as the first burrito I ate here.

You can't go wrong ordering chips & salsa here.  There's nothing like dipping those mult-colored tortilla chips in that salsa verde.

And don't be afraid to order a drink with your food....because they have so many delicious beverages to choose from.  Don't get Coke or Sprite...try something new!  They have horchata, jamaica, timarindo, pina colada, etc.  Try one of those and it won't disappoint.  I'm salivating just by typing those words."}
{"text":"I liked it! Ended up here after roaming the area for good lunch eats. The decor is untasteful except for the many cheerful paintings on the wall.

Place does not seem to be popular as it was at 1/5 empty. Anyhow, I ordered the steak fajita and it was good! And waited for the small sizzling plate with beef come out... yay!"}
{"text":"Love this place ! Mom and pop feel with authentic Mexican food. Great prices for fast and causal food"}
{"text":"Great non- greasy Mexican food. 

Easy place to grab food on a budget and quickly.  Service is fast and food is consistently good. 

Lots of breakfast options too!"}
{"text":"Because the sign said \"cantina\", we were expecting more of a restaurant and bar than a counter with tables. We walked in and thought, ok I guess we place our order at the cashier and then find a seat. But we were seated and given menus, though they were paper and all the other service items were paper/plastic except for my margarita glass. It felt odd because it was kind of trying to be a restaurant but only in certain ways. I guess I shouldn't complain because the prices were very reasonable. We had a nice waitress with good service. Overall the food was great! I wasn't that hungry but the blackened chicken tacos with a hard shell were awesome and could have eaten 5 or 6. If I could get specific with improvements, it would be to offer real plates and glasses for all table service, upgrade the paper napkins and menus and warm up the chips and offer them complimentary."}
{"text":"This is a good place to get a burrito, it looks like there whole menu is good because the place was full during lunch time.

I got myself a carna asada burrito and fries. The burrito was good but the fries were way to oily for my taste.

Since of the name I was hoping their sauce would stand out but it wasn't that great.

Overall it has a great atmosphere and a tasty burrito."}
{"text":"Very tasty and quick Mexican food. I've been here a couple times now and everything I've tried has been very good. The Kayla's breakfast is delicious, as are the carne asada tacos and blackened fish tacos."}
{"text":"Great service, quick lunch.  Food is just ok, but I only tried the tacos.  Worth a try if you're nearby."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday and the food has absolutely no taste. They need some lessons from Robert Irvine as the cheapest way to season food is salt and pepper! There was NO flavor on any of the Caritas we had. I would not recommend this place to send your money!"}
{"text":"So I have a friend who owns a concierge service and I've eaten at her house several times and it's all from scratch mind blowingly delicious foods and as a concierge service she gets to eat all over the valley at fine restaurants to taste test - so with that foundation I ask her where she wants to meet and I pull up to a mom and pop small Mexican restaurant in a strip mall where you order at the counter - on my gosh - the guacamole are you kidding me I still dream of the taste - had a shredded pork burrito I took a bite and just sat there and tried to decide how anything this simple tasted so great - it was amazing and she said anything is easily the same just amazing someone came by and checked on us a half dozen times place was very busy over lunch - this is a can't lose deal here I'd drive the 22 miles right now to experience that again home run great food friendly large portion took some home low price I'm at a loss for words HOME RUN!!!"}
{"text":"So yummy!!!! My favorite Mexican place ever!!  Amazing service and great food! My kids love it too."}
{"text":"First time here & had the HH mini chicken Chimis special. The best I ever had, Delicious & I will be back again. Very quick service as well."}
{"text":"If you like spicy food and some well cooked shrimp then this is the best place to be. I had ordere ala mexicana and it was amazing."}
