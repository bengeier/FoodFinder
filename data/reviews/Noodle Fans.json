{"text":"Came in for a lunch date with my wife, we were hesitant to dine here but thought that we would at least look at the menu. The minute we walked in we were intoxicated with this delicious smell that I knew we had to explore further! Unlike many Chinese restaurants the service is good and friendly. The menu is very well put together. We ordered the hand pulled Ramen w/braised beef, sliced noodle with beef and a sesame pancake w/sliced  beef. The food was delicious and very well priced; nothing fancy but it sure matched all the wonderful smells. I would definitely come back and suggest you try this place, it's cozy ,the food is great, priced right and it's one of those places you must try. Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"We found a bug in our noodles. Disappointing at the handling of the situation. Would not recommend this place for sanity concern."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times because my roommate loves their noodles. Food wise; The noodles are not bad but the soup base lacks flavors. Do recommend the lamb skewers as they are probably the best thing on the menu . Service wise; there's a 50/50 that you will either get a server that's amazing or the really shitty ones who acts like you forced them to work there and treats you horribly and will ignore you as well. 
Also, They constantly forgets orders (they forgot parts of our orders on three different occasions)  And if you ever ask them about your missing orders they will raise their voice at you.  Overall, the food is average and the service is horrible. Would not recommend at all."}
{"text":"The hype is real on this place! Heard the stories about the long wait times from several friends (some of them have gone 7 times already), but thankfully I did not wait at all here. Came 12pm on a Saturday, maybe had to sitdown for 3 minutes but I'd not call that a wait.

I'm vegetarian, and any other veggie person in 'Sauga can share in the pain of not having good veggie Chinese options in town aside from Zen Gardens... but going to Zen Gardens involves convincing your meat eating friends to eat fake meat, hard to do all the time! Noodle Fans got me excited because they not only have multiple main dish veggie options, they have quite a few vegetarian side dish options too.

I had the spicy think noodles cut by the robot (their thick noodles are cut by a robot btw, cool to watch). Had the spicy potato shreds and scallion pancake too. The pancake was tasty, and the potato shreds were AMAZING, so damn flavorful. Finally the spicy noodles, pretty basic some noodles in oil/vinegar with garlic/pepper powder. They threw some bok choy in there too. I wouldn't mind some MSG thrown in there though, wish they had an MSG shaker but people are still all anti-MSG. But I'm splitting hairs on this.

Prices are great, staff is great, so nice to have this option in 'Sauga now and I will be coming back over and over again."}
{"text":"Reviews for this place have consistently gone down since my last visit, but I still enjoyed our small Mother's Day celebration here nevertheless! We were a party of five, and ordered the following to share (as a side note, I did appreciate that we were given a sheet of paper to note down the menu numbers to avoid ordering confusion and to improve efficiencies):

Lamb Skewers:
This came in a set of four skewers - the tiny, gamey morsels of lamb were generously coated with a mixture of spices (cumin, pepper, chillies, etc.) and grilled/fried. It was addicting and delicious, but made my breath smell garlicky and cumin-y for a good couple hours after! My sister consumed a whole skewer and a half by herself. Our must-order every time we come!

Grilled Bean Curd Sheets:
First time ordering these, and they were oh so crispy! The bean curd sheets are coated in a similar mixture as the lamb skewers, and the crisp ends of the rolled sheets offer a nice crackle when you bite into them.

Scallion Pancake:
Didn't try this dish, so unfortunately can't really speak to it!

Fuqi Feipian:
Our classic must-order every time we go to a Northern Chinese place. The thin slices of beef come with cross sections of tendons; only complaint is that it was mostly beef flank and very little everything else. Perfect size for a small appetizer!

Braised Beef Noodles:
There is nothing more soothing and comforting than a good bowl of braised beef noodles. We got the ramen (hand-pulled kind, not the knife-cut ones), and I loved the pickled vegetables that came with the soup (there were three thin slices of pickled radish)! I was also delighted to find a slice of shiitake mushrooms, along with some pieces of beef tendon. The beef was braised quite tenderly - not bad.

Stir-fried Lamb Noodles:
We ordered this dish solely because we were captivated by a table that had made this order on our previous visit. Overall, it was eh. The gamey taste of the lamb didn't really come through, and so any other meat/protein could have been a substitute. Due to the overwhelming amount of Chinese celery, the dish had a strong celery flavour. There were also generous portions of tomatoes, and some fatty stringy lamb bits. 

Overall, not a meal that blew me away, but it was a fun sharing experience for Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try out this restaurant for awhile now but the line up was always long. I finally decided to wait in line today and see what the hype was about. The service was very slow and the food quality wasn't anything to write home about. We ordered the braised beef sliced noodle which supposed to be spicy, but it was not and tasted regular. I did not try the skewers. Overall, I would only come back if there wasn't a line up and if I craved a noodle soup. I am not a fan of noodle fans!"}
{"text":"Waited an hr to get a seat and half an hr to get food after handing in the orders. Was it worth it? Prob not. Was the service good? Nope. The quantity and texture of the noodle and beef was good but def not worth the wait and the bad service."}
{"text":"It's okay. I mean, I have to give them the benefit of the doubt - they just opened here so they don't seem to have everything together yet the place was packed. 

We were surprised that 1/3 of their menu was unavailable today - they didn't have any stir-fried noodle options, or any of the rice options. It limited us to soup noodles and snacks and appies essentially.

Luckily the noodles were good - the right elasticity and texture, and the soup broths were decent. The spicy one was not spicy at all, but the pork one had actual ginseng in it. I wish there was more vegetables in each bowl.

Pricing wise it was okay. About $9 per bowl so it wasn't breaking the bank or anything, but it wasn't anything to write home about.

We'll keep this place in our back pocket for options on variety, but it probably won't be a go to choice in this plaza for us."}
{"text":"Acceptable Lanzhou noodle place. The place is busy and their noodle are the better ones, but other dishes are very average. Came with coworkers for lunch and we tried a bunch of items on their menu. Most of them just so so, but their noodles sure worth to try. I tried typical Lanzhou noodle, will try different noodle next time."}
{"text":"Noodle Fans is probably best known for their freshly made Chinese style ramen. Contrary to some feedback I heard before my initial visit, my experience was actually quite pleasant. The first time I went, I tried the hand-pulled ramen with braised beef. The hand-pulled noodles were very good.  It had great texture, tasted fresh and the broth was flavourful.  The braised beef however was just average for me.  

For my second visit, I had the hand pulled ramen again but with their regular beef (sliced beef). The broth in this case was more refreshing and clear. The regular slice beef is also much more tender compared to the braised beef.

Portions for the ramen is decent. It's a great alternative to pho if you are craving a bowl of hot noodles. I am looking forward to trying their sliced noodles next time."}
{"text":"Visited this place Sunday night and was surprised there wasn't a Yelp page yet, it was PACKED. 

This restaurant is located in the Golden Square plaza behind Btrust Supermarket. 
It serves Northern Chinese hand-pulled noodles among other dishes. 
After about a 20-minute wait, we were seated at a table.
The place was very busy so service was definitely staggered but pleasant. 

We ordered the braised beef soup with sliced noodles, the hot and sour pork with sliced noodles, and a couple meat skewers.
Braised Beef: Good but lacking a bit of flavour. I usually expect anything braised to be a bit more intense than what I tasted here. Also, we weren't sure what the 'sliced noodles' would look like but they were quite big, kind of like a slightly flatter udon noodle. 
Hot and Sour Pork: The soup had great flavour but the pork was very much lacking. The few cuts that were in it, were probably 90% fat. This was disappointing but if you're not a big meat lover, this dish comes with potatoes; tofu; and carrots which sort of made up for it.
Meat skewers: We got lamb and beef. Both were looked quite dry but they were actually really juicy and delicious. Only point of criticism is that the size of the skewers were a bit small for what you're paying.

Overall, pretty good. Not the best hand-pulled noodles I've had but I would visit again."}
{"text":"Hubby loves noodle, he was so excited to see Noodle Fans opening in Mississauga. There ain't many authentic noodle place here on the west end of the city, so I understand the long line up. We tried off hours (like 3pm in the afternoon), still have to wait for a seat for 15mins... Good quality is good, service is so so (I guess too many people). To me, not worth the wait, but hubby is willing to wait for over 30mins... I love the house special noodle and the BBQ lamb kabob (but they sold out couple times when I was there). The side dishes taste good, but portions are smaller than other noodle houses in Scarborough or Markham. If they improve  their service a bit, and the waiting line is not that long, I will probably give it a 5 star."}
{"text":"Restaurant is clean, didn't have to wait long, food amount is ok. The reasons for three stars are - food taste is about bland, customer service is below Canadian standard and we had to wait 30 mins for food. Also, our table sat six, and we were 4. They assigned other two chairs to strangers, which is not super uncommon in a busy area, but they didn't ask for our permission. For four people, we paid 50, 4 dishes."}
{"text":"Very authentic northwestern Chinese cuisine. I've been craving some authentic Lanzhou Ramen for years! 
The broth in traditional beef noodle is on point, I can tell it's slowcooked beef stock, so aromatic and savoury. I don't know why people are saying it's bland....it's what the dish is supposed to taste like. 

The chili oil sauce smells amazing. Too bad they don't have white pepper available. 

Hand pulled noodles is what \"Ramen\" actually means, not those crappy spaghetti strings they sell at Kenzo. Plus the food is so cheap, what a gem. Thank God I'd never have to go to Kenzo again if i'm craving Ramen. I've been here with friends for more than 8 times in a month. 

lamb skewers are divine!  definitely give these a try.


Downside is the seatings are limited, meal time wait can get outta hand.... but then again, it's telling you the food is great!"}
{"text":"Been there twice now... not more than my sister... 5 times I think!

The noodle cutting robot is cool but wish it was more visible or interacted with the kids. 

That is the star of the show, the hand sliced noodles, whether you have it with soup or stir fry it is all delicious, chewy and soft.  Get the veggie spicy stirfry sliced noodles if you love garlic and red vinegar!

I hope their quality doesn't slow down. The garlic in their sauces is strong and how I like it!

Their appetizer lists and skewers list is good and plentiful of veggie options. 

I didn't like any of their onion pancakes or beef rolls which is unfortunate... oily, no flavor and super thick bread...

Their seating system needs to be worked through and the fact that they have 2 doors. Last time they forgot my veggie noodle stirfry and I had to remind them after my whole party has finished eating. My dad was expecting an apology or a discount, we got the apology but no discount lol 

Will go back again :)"}
{"text":"I didn't expect anything from Noodle Fans but was impressed by them. This is a fantastic place to get some beef noodles here, with some cold appetizers and some skewers for a complete and wholesome meal. 

I can't say I'm the most knowledgeable on beef noodles. There's so many types and I've had some pretty bad underwhelming ones before, but this was great. You can see the noodles being handmade in the back and the noodles were amazing. They were al-dente and had some snap and a light chew to them. I had the ramen sized noodles but I'll definitely come here to get the thicker hand-cut ones next time, to pick up all that delicious broth; Which is what really surprised me the most. The broth which is probably even more vital to a bowl of beef noodle soup than the noodles. It was flavorful, it was meaty, and hearty! There was also a decent amount of braised beef here and they were in small chunks which is in perfect bite sized pieces for easy eating.

To go along with their beef noodle soup, you can get an assortment of BBQ skewers here. We ordered some lamb skewers and they were explosive with flavorful. They were on the saltier side but very flavorful with the spice and cumin going on. They weren't overly charred and there was even some nice crunch tendons there! It's the perfect accompaniment to a bowl of warm noodle soup. 

There's also many cold appetizers to choose from if BBQ skewers aren't your thing. We went with the jellyfish and cucumbers which were all nice and crunchy in a mildly spicy chili oil. Their green onion pancake roll was also pretty good, it was somewhat sweet and spicy and the beef they used was actually meaty and not fatty. However I'd say their pancake was a bit too flaky and didn't taste too fresh. But I really liked the flavors otherwise!"}
{"text":"Fresh made pulled noodles. That alone is worth a visit. I had the hand-pulled ramen soup with beef which was quite pleasant. I noticed that as time went by, the soup tasted better, probably due to the flavours of all the ingredients being absorbed into the liquid. You write down your order and hand it to the server - who forgot to order my soup, so I patiently picked away at my lunch partner's plate of food. Then I reminded him and the huge bowl arrived. Don't stare at the beef too hard or too long - a lot of it lacks eye appeal. This place is nice for a change. I may come back in the summer if I am passing by."}
{"text":"The two types of noodles were pretty interesting. Food overall is decent but salty. The noodle menu items with a chili next to it to indicate spiciness were disappointingly not spicy at all.  But the broth tastes alright, not too flavorful though. The weirdest part of the noodle dishes is we got two dishes with the same braised beef topping with different noodles but the toppings differ in the two  ....like one had radish slices in it and the other didn't, so I don't know if that's a consistency issue or if the two toppings (of the same named dish) are just supposed to be different. The lamb rice dish ... It's difficult to distinguish if it's beef or actually lamb as marketed, as it tasted nothing like lamb at all. The whole dish, to put it nicely, tasted like beef and salt. Service wise, was lacking. Found the servers to be pretty rude, cold, and unwelcoming. None of them smiled at all, not even once and when we asked them questions, they replied in a rude manner. Decorations wise, the little booth where the chefs make your noodles is quite different, but most of the main decors were the same as Bayview Garden that was here before this place took over, with minor exceptions like the tables and chairs. Overall, experience eating here was passable, albeit a bit unwelcoming, nothing special."}
{"text":"I ordered 1102- beef noodle soup. I thought this place would help me with my cravings. Very disappointed. The soup was so bland it literally had no taste. The quality of the beef was not up to the standard where an authentic beef noodle soup should be. The portion was pretty good. We also ordered the beef rolls( green onion rolls) they were crispy but way too oily. My overall experience was meh will not go back."}
{"text":"I still keep the same rating for this restaurant. 

Good thing for this place is that the taste for each dish is fairly consistent and wouldn't expect to have a dish that is too good or too bad for each visit. The new menu they provide is a lot more organized and neat than the previous one. 

Just an additional tip to the last review, this restaurant has two entrances. Since the parking space within the Golden Square is very limited, it is always to recommend to park the car behind the restaurant which the parking space is a lot more. 

Again, as a chained restaurant, it is very unfortunate that the payment method is very limited here. Additional note for the payment option, even though you can use the debit card there (when the amount is over $15), the tap feature wouldn't work on the POS machine. If you only bring your phone which has apply/andriod pay feature, it wouldn't work there."}
{"text":"Noodle Fans was a pleasant surprise - the line was fast, food was decent and seating plenty. The smell of spices is strong in the restaurant, a sign of good lamb skewers, but your clothes/bag/hair will reek of cumin the next day.

The traditional hand-pulled noodles with braised beef consists of chewy noodles, tender beef slices and pickled radishes in warm, clear broth. The dish lacked balance with way too much noodles. Of the many sides and BBQ dishes, we ordered the BBQ cabbage and cucumber salad - both good. 

Would recommend as a place to bring family and friends."}
{"text":"Noodle Fans had a hype when it first opened - complete disorganization and they were not prepared for the amount of people generated. The wait time for seat was almost 45 minutes when it first opened but now there is barely any. My ticket seat during the mess and disorganization was not called upon and instead they scratched my name off the list. This resulted in me wasting more time in general. Also it seems if the front entrance is busy - try the back entrance cause they usually don't align the two queues together. Back entrance apparently has its own queue that you could wait for and is shorter wait if it's busy. 

Food-wise: I thought it was average. Not necessarily worth the hype at all and portions were decent. Lots of teenagers/university students come out during the later nights so you'll see an obvious shift from families to night life late eating per se."}
{"text":"This is basically your typical Chinese restaurant. We came for ramen cause I had as desperate for some soup and decided to try this place since Kenzo was closed sundays.

I ordered the spare ribs ramen while my boyfriend ordered the beef. Honestly, it tasted like pho so that's why I lowered down the ratings. They do have a wide selection of other Chinese soups and traditional dishes. I'd go back for the Chinese dishes, not the ramen."}
{"text":"Can here with my family. The noodle is good  . So the barberque meat. But their appetizers are very disappointing! Would not recommend anyone for their appetizers at all. I won't be back unless I want some noodles."}
{"text":"This is a new noodle/Chinese ramen restaurant. It is very busy with a very poor numbering system, typical dim sum hand out paper system. After at least a 30 min wait our group of 4 was seated. Service was good but the food took a little longer than expected to arrive. 

I ordered the Sliced Noodle Soup with Beef at $8.99. The soup is not bad, the sliced noodle has a very unique texture, the Beef was nothing impressive. The chicken cartilage skewer costs $5.99, it was tasty enough that I would try that again. 

Would I wait this long again for a Chinese restaurant? Probably not. But Mississauga doesn't have that many choices."}
{"text":"Note:  Language could be an issue.  Female server asked us to speak in Cantonese/Mandarin when we asked her for the bill.  Uh-oh!

This restaurant is located in the former unit of Bayview Garden, so you can enter from the front as well as the back of the restaurant.  Front of restaurant is beside kareoke joint, adjacent to Chi's Congee.

I'm pretty sure the server forgotten to put in our order!  A couple who arrived 10-15mins after us were already tucking into their meal.  

Most casual Chinese restaurants are known to serve up food at the same pace as McD's, but after 30mins of no food, we had to say something to the male server who took our order.  He showed us the order sheet and asked, \"Is this yours?\" in Mandarin.  This tells me that he didn't know his arse from his elbow.  It was no coincidence that our food arrived within 5mins of asking where it was!

Sitting in a booth, you could have issues flagging a server down.  We certainly did!  Verdict:  Spotty service.

Food was ok.  It's Sichuan food so think peppercorns, chilli oil, cumin, lamb, and handmade noodles.  The stir-fried noodle dish was ok - tomatoes were unexpected - however, I think that I'd prefer a noodle in soup dish instead.  Lamb skewers had a lovely seasoning on them - they were medium spicy!

Would rate higher if service was more efficient and professional!"}
{"text":"Nice little noodle bar that opened up not too long ago. It replaced Bayview Gardens. The interior hasn't changed much from the previous restaurant but there are some minor changes to the place. Like the tables and chairs. 

The menu they have is kinda small but I guess that's how they specialize in their food. They pretty much specialize in noodles, Chinese ramen noodles and Chinese slices noodles. But they also have rice dishes and BBQ skewers. 

I like their sliced noodles. The noodles are chewy and have a nice texture. However the soup base is what they need to improve on. I've been here a couple of times and the soup is still not as strong or flavourful as it should be. If they improved on that, the food would be sooooo much better.  

I've also tried their skewers. The meat is pretty good for both lamb and beef. But I still prefer the lamb one better because the meat is more tender. The flavours of these skewers pretty much taste like the ones you get from Chinese night markets. Totally recommended. 

As for service, id have to say, it's pretty bad. One time we ordered skewers and it never came. We asked them and they said the order wasn't put in. But they didn't offer to make us an order either due to their mistake since it was close to closing time. 

Another time I went, food took a while to come and we were missing one bowl. We informed them and They said that all our orders are out but they missed a bowl noodle for my aunt... 

Overall, a decent place for a bite. But remember to track what you've order because they miss out on orders a lot."}
{"text":"Possibly had my best beef noodle in the GTA here. This place is packed during peak hours ready to wait for around 10 mins for a table. They specialize in hand-pulled noodle soup but you can also get your noodles knife-cut by a robot behind the open kitchen.

We ordered the original beef noodle (aka Lanzhou noodles), beef tendon noodle, squid tentacle, and lamb skewers. The beef noodle was our favourite as the noodles and broth were made perfectly. The squid tentacles were a let down however, since they had this odd flavour while we ate it. The lamb skewers were a nice touch, they weren't expensive to get compared to other places and they were also delicious."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp using the location tool, so I wanted to check it out since it's new. They offer hand-pulled noodles, but they do have a decent variety of other dishes like ramen, skewers and BBQ items. I opted for the Sliced Noodles with Braised Beef ($8.99). My noodles dish was good, but it lacked spice even though it was supposed to be spicy. They do have Sriracha and chilli oil on the table though. Tastes much better with the chilli oil. I did liked the chewy texture of the noodles, and there was a decent amount of braised beef as well. Not bad at all for the price. We also ordered a couple of skewers, and once again they were disappointedly very mild."}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY?

The hand pulled noodle of course!

Their style comes from the city of Lanzhou in China. Come expecting customers slurping on noodles from a bowl and ordering small dishes to share. You can also see the noodle in action from an open kitchen they designed with the restaurant. You can also check out the Noodle Robot that they have who slices dough into noodle pieces. Like a ninja! Pretty cool. Of course, you can also see the cooks pulling flour apart, stretching, pounding, and pulling to get the structure of noodles. 

I ordered both the hand pulled noodles and the noodle where it's like pieces of noodle chunks. Both had the al Dante texture and the shapes were irregular so you know it's fresh. I was kind of disappointed in the soup base though. I thought there wasn't much flavor to it and both noodles had the same broth or soup base. The only difference was the other toppings added to the soup. One had bok choi while the other didn't. The dishes are also more on the expensive end. For Chinese food standard, a small dish can easily cost $6-7 dollars and you don't get that much either. Overall I thought it was alright. 

Last tip?

Don't forget to check out the noodle robot in action who can be found close to the kitchen and remember to bring cash because it's cash only here!"}
{"text":"A new Chinese noodle restaurant that opened up recently which replaced Bayview Gardens beside Btrust. A few friends hyped it up and said it tasted pretty good. Other than Pho and ramen joints, I've never tried \"Chinese style\" noodle soup dishes. We came by (party of 11) around 1130 on Sunday afternoon and it wasn't that busy yet as it opened at 11. We had a big party so we took the biggest circle table at the back end and there was still enough room for probably 2 more people. 

What we ordered:
1102 - hand pulled ramen w/ braised beef in soup $8.5
1107 - hand pulled ramen w/ hot & sour sauce + pork $8.50
1702 - beef skewer with special seasoning $5.99

Not your typical \"ramen\" the noodles are made in house and they tasted fresh. Other than fresh noodles, the dish was alright. There are two types of noodles. Ramen which is a little thicker than your typical Japanese ramen and sliced noodles which is like ho fun noodles. 

1102 and 1107 were indicated as spicy but there was 0 spice at all. There were sauces on the table and we put chill oil in it to add some flavour to it.. helped a bit. 
1107 soup tasted pretty good but there was way too much vegetables in it (carrots, potatoes, and tomato) and eating that itself got me pretty full. The portions of noodles they gave was a lot so that's a good thing. There was very little pork pieces in the dish.. majority of them were fatty pieces. 
1102 tasted bland. The dishes look like something I could make at home. 
1702 was good. Tasted very Malaysian. I probably liked this the most out of them all. 

They accept cash and debit. 

Probably won't come back here again by choice."}
