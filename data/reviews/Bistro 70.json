{"text":"This food was delicious.  I travel a lot and recently spent time in Rhode Island, but this place certainly had the best Lobster Mac and Cheese I've ever had.  Go here just for that.  It's a small place, the atmosphere is very nice, and my server Lindsay did a fantastic job.  I will make it a point to stop here when I am in town again for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, and great martinis, a real gem in Painesville"}
{"text":"Been going here for years and it's getting with every visit.  On my last visit I had the grouper piccata and it was outstanding !   $25 with app and dessert = phenomenal value.      Pricing is very good for the value of food you're receiving.  Wine selection is above average.    Great service all around but especially with Matt being behind the bar.   Keep up the great work ! !"}
{"text":"Such an awesome little place. The food is always good, dessert is amazing and the ambiance is nice too! A little pricey but I don't mind paying for an expensive meal once in a while if the food is great. We come here a few times a year and are always satisfied when we leave!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed an anniversary dinner here last weekend, and we can't wait to go back! We shared the lobster nachos, lobster bisque, and a salad, all of which were amazing. The nachos had a lovely kick without getting overwhelmingly spicy. I enjoyed their special hangar steak and my husband devoured the stuffed grouper. Even though he was getting full, the food was too good to leave any over. I did take some home and it was amazing the second time too! Great little place, super friendly staff (chef said hi), highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Although pricey, the food was well worth it! Got the lamb lollipops and ahi tuna for apps, which were both yummy. Ordered the veal parmesan as an entree and it was pretty good. What really made this dining experience exceptional was the wait staff. They were really friendly, knowledgeable, and accommodating! I also really enjoyed the cleanliness and modern decor."}
{"text":"Great food, stiff drinks, friendly service. Excellent experience for our first time. We will definitely be back!Special thanks to Julie for her hospitality as our waitress."}
{"text":"Totally surprised. We found this place almost by accident and had a wonderful meal. Great service. Cool place. Will definitely try to get back here."}
{"text":"Very good salads, pastas, and meat dishes!  Quaint and swanky, especially for Painesville."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time trying Bistro 70. They advertise an intriguing \"Prix Fixe\" for 19.99. The Prix Fixe consisted of 3 courses; soup or salad option, entree and dessert option. We thought this would be the perfect way to experience their menu for the first time. The warm bread and olive oil were fantastic. Our first course: house salad with balsamic dressing and French onion soup. The salad and dressing was very nice and the soup flavor was wonderful but the soup wasn't very hot. Second course: beef stroganoff and fried chicken. Both dishes seemed like they had been sitting for a bit. The pasta sauce was room temp and slightly congealed. The fried chicken was soggy and lacked seasoning. Dessert course: chocolate chip cookie and cinnamon roll. Both were fine, not really impressive but were dressed up with a pretty plate presentation. The service was spotty with the most notable part being when he asked us if our meals were worth the $20 dollars. Seemed a bit odd of a question. All in all it was adequate but we didn't feel that the meal represented what the establishment is capable of."}
{"text":"10 of us dined here a few weeks ago and were delighted with the food and service. Great drinks, great food, and excellent service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Bistro 70.  I am glad we decided to go to this hidden gem located in Painesville.  We started off the evening with some  cocktails.  For dinner my wife ordered the Prix  Fixe special which was a 3 course meal with different options for each course, which I thought was pretty nice because you can choose what you feel like having for each course. For the first course she chose the Chicken  Paprikash soup which I ate and it's was just marvelous.  The spatzel was so good, the chicken was very tender, and the soup was seasoned very well.  I really enjoyed having that soup so much I can't stop thinking about it. For her second course she chose the meatloaf, which included a side of mashed potatoes and gravy, and asparagus.  My wife said that the meatloaf very tasty along with the mashed potatoes and the asparagus.  The only negative was the gravy, which was little thin and runny, but all in all, it was a great second course. For desert, she ordered a cinnamon roll, but ended up having it boxed up to take home. I ordered the small plate of Blackened Grouper Bites.  OMG, they were phenomenal.  The Grouper was so tasty, and flaky.  The sauce that came with it was an excellent accompaniment to the Grouper. I would highly recommend this dish, you will not be disappointed. Erica, our server did an excellent job attending to us.  She was very friendly and engaging, and very helpful with the menu. This is a very nice restaurant, tastefully decorated, and very inviting. We will be coming back. Check out the pictures I took of our dinners and the restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the most unbelievable, miserable mistakes I have ever made while traveling.  As a frequent traveler and patron of \"out of the way and unique\" establishments, I am absolutely floored by the rude, dismissive staff that runs this hole. From the very second my wife and I entered the virtually deserted establishment, we were treated like a troop of homeless vagrants.  The gal at the door chastised us for no reservations(again the only 2 patrons in the entire establishment) before being advised that we were only planning on sitting at the bar. Bartender \"Flow\" was no better. Not only was she rude, loud and extremely unprofessional, she obviously had no idea how to mix a simple margarita. As the rest of our group arrived, it got no better. She even went so far as belittling the gentleman on my left, to the gentleman seated to my right not knowing that they were together.  In a town that obviously has nothing to offer, these folks lived up to that expectation.  In would rather eat at a homeless shelter next time...."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  I always get the lamb lollipops and the 10 Oz cap steak with truffle butter. Always excellent!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Highly recommend tuna appetizer!  Server Tammy was very friendly & helpful.  Thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience here!"}
{"text":"12/13/13 We had our Xmas party at Bistro 70 and it was truly a great time.  The food was fantastic including the lollipop lamb and yummy shrimp and duck fat fries!!  We love this place.  The food and drinks and the staff are all excellent."}
{"text":"Almost a 5 star..  A 5 is perfect.  It's close.  Great ambiance, killer martinis, melt in the mouth fillet (blue cheese encrusted medallions), impeccable  service.  Great date night for the \"mature\" set!  Price is appropriate to the quality."}
{"text":"All around.-Very deliciousThe waitress was amazing and so compliant. Quaint little upscale place"}
{"text":"Cozy would be the first word that comes to mind when walking in the door of this restaurant. The decor is playful in the bar area which compliments the ambiance in the surrounding open dining room.  The wait staff was very charming, prompt, attentive and thorough. We had many appetizers to start. The seared ahi tuna is highly recommended. We had a few glasses of wine, which are $5 a pour on Tuesdays. Nice! And the seasonal Snowball Martini was awesome!  Our entrees were a house special 3-course dinner including French onion soup, Beef Strognaff and cinnamon roll dessert. I had the grouper bites as my entree with the blue salad. Our friend got the Ribeye dinner with big, plump sauteed mushrooms and whipped potatoes with broccolini. Everything arrived timely and perfect and delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant! Can't wait to go back! Another gem of Lake County!"}
{"text":"Took my God son there for his 24th birthday.  What a wonderful meal. Started with a nice glass of wine and a bloody mary wedge salads to follow with bread and dipping oil with shredded  asaiagio . He had the special veal picatta with feta cheese and kalamata olives.  I enjoyed the flank steak with a blue cheese butter and we both had the roasted red pepper risotto. We wrapped it up with a trio of cake pops and a birthday candle. The only thing missing were more diners to enjoy the surprise hidden in the middle of Painesville City.  It is a quick 25 minute drive from Cleveland or the east burbs.  The wait staff were very friendly and accommodating and the owner stopped by our table to chat and make sure we were enjoying ourselves.  Price point was very good and left with smiles on our faces."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times, and the food is consistently excellent. The yummy yummy shrimp appetizer is exactly what it claims! The wedge salad is fresh, crisp, and awesome. The menu changes a bit, seasonally, but whatever is on the menu is always very good. Service is friendly and efficient. We have never gotten a below average meal at this establishment, and every time we have had a meal, chef comes out to see how we liked the meal. Nice touch!   ."}
{"text":"I have always had really great food here, but the other night I had the pan seared sea bass with a thai-coconut sauce.  It was nothing short of amazing.  They were also really wonderful about accommodating my vegan dining companion. The blueberry mojito was delicious. Every time I have been there, the chef/owner has stopped by to say hello and check on us.  This is what going out to eat is all about.  Great service and wonderful food."}
{"text":"Four stars to me is excellent...five is perfect. Not quite perfect, but most excellent. Something of a 'diamond in the rough?'  We held a rehearsal dinner here, using the loft for about 28 people. Ambiance is great - the kids in our group loved the big windows - they sat on the floor and looked out the windows. Food was pretty much set up once we got there, but not quite ready to be served. I missed the part where they told me they would dismiss tables...and I dismissed the party myself...so I threw a bit of chaos in for the staff. I am not sure if I mis-calculated, or the restaurant did (it was most likely my fault!), but we were exactly one chair and place setting short for our group. The staff handled it quickly, with no issues, and I was pleased with the service.   Food-wise for the catering...pasta was wonderful, and I normally do not like pasta from restaurants. Veggie was something of a ratatouille, which was good, but had maybe just a touch too much oregano? Chicken parmesan was tender and moist, but had a totally different sauce from the pasta, one with differerent spices it seemed. It was good, just threw my palate off a bit.  I think one suggestion would be to have a good moscato by the glass, especially during the summer months.   I would absolutely have another event here. Good food, good atmosphere, able to work within my budget, and the staff was great. Thanks for a good event!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best dinner I had the whole week while here on Business. The atmosphere was great, the food fantastic, and the service was a step above. Katie was our waitress and they featured her homemade desert, Strawberry Shortcake and it was wonderful. Can't go wrong at this place!! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"My fiancee is gluten / dairy free and the kitchen did a great job making a special dish for her that was fantastic. I had the stuffed grouper and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the standard to which we hold all others. We have eaten here several times and every single time have had courteous service and amazing food. On several occasions the owner himself has verified that our meals were top notch. The menu is slightly pricey for the area but well worth every penny.  Keep up the good work!  We will have to try half price sushi and martini night one Thursday!"}
{"text":"Omg what a wonderful nite we had! The food was awesome ! We had the chicken special. Wonderful!! Are server was Flo so knowledgeable.  Suny was the manager checking on us frequently. The chef came to our table to  ask us if we had any questions and if we were happy. What is that about? Who does that what is that about!!!!! Love that place !!! It will be my favorite starting now check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I travelled from Washington D.C. up to visit my old stomping grounds and on New Years Eve, I needed a last minute reservation for dinner for 2.  I came to Yelp to find something in the area and they were highly recommended.  The service was great, the staff was friendly, the food was amazing.   Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Visiting from CA. Outstanding food and service! Try taco Tuesday. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Can't believe this place has been around and we didn't know about it. Great service, drinks and foods. We will be regulars .... :)"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 4 1/4 stars. Food is really good, as service was really good. Dinner entrees are from $18 to $35. Restaurant was clean with a hipster ambiance. The patrons and restaurant were fairly casual, i.e. I would feel uncomfortable wearing a suit here. There were a lot of hard surfaces that reflect sound in the dining area, so it was uncomfortably loud at times even though they weren't supper busy. Our party ordered the veal saltimbocca, wild mushroom pasta, and veal parmesan entrees. The veal saltimbocca was very good (not best ever but better than most). The wild mushroom pasta was very unusual, with bits of what I believe were walnuts mixed into the sauce. The sauce had a very nutty flavor. It was good, but I can't imagine craving to order it again. On  side note, it also could be ordered with shrimp or chicken. I just can't picture shrimp complimenting the flavor of the dish; I should have asked the chef about it.. The veal parmesan was standard and as expected. The veal was tender, but there was nothing stand out about the dish. The servers were attentive, and provided great service of the sort one would expect at a restaurant such as Bistro 70. I wouldn't put it on my must go to places when visiting Cleveland, but if your looking for a good restaurant that doesn't have or need a mascot when visiting Painesville, check it out."}
{"text":"How does a vegan end up at a steakhouse in Painesville?   I was coerced into going to Bistro 70 over the weekend to attend a family member's birthday dinner. I don't spend much time in Painesville, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but this little restaurant was very cute. It has nice decor and a modern menu, featuring things like duck fat fries and pork belly. (and Moscow Mules on the drink menu)  I'm generally opposed to dining out in huge groups because, well...service is generally not the best. And that was the case with our table. There were 8 adults, one child, and an infant. We had reservations for 6 pm and were seated promptly. Our server got us drinks right away but as more people started arriving, she got kind of overwhelmed. Or the gar got backed up. Or something. She was really nice but the pacing was all off for our meal. I'd imagine there's a small kitchen in this restaurant but it took what seemed like an eternity for us to get our salads and we ate them out of bread because when we requested more, our server told us they were baking more. There was a big enough gap in time between our salad course and our entrees to take lots of birthday pictures. I guess that was a plus?  I give the chef props for making me a vegan meal on the fly. (gluten free, too, which I didn't ask for, but I can see why that would be a logical option) I had rice noodles with olive oil and garlic and a bunch of vegetables. It wasn't the best meal I've ever eaten, but I wasn't expecting much in a steakhouse. My fiance had a steak that he didn't really care for and I noticed a lot of other non-empty plates around the table. My mom had a mushroom pasta that she really seemed to enjoy, though. My mother had also brought in a cake and our server put candles in it, cut it, etc. That was a nice touch.   Overall, I think we all enjoyed a solid \"ok\" meal. Not sure we'll be heading back anytime soon but this was a nice little place to have a family meal."}
{"text":"Cool small place, cozy atmosphere. Great service, reasonable prices, concise menu. Fair number of specials. I had the hanger steak, it was above average, but I expected a bit better. Would certainly go back and try again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have had dinner here a few times and each time I have been blown away. The food is incredible, the decor is great and the service has always been more than solid. I have even been for a work outing, with different finger foods, and those were all amazing as well. Definitely give this place a try, you will be happy you took the chance."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I give it 5 stars for its superior food quality and awesome service.  All of the servers and bartenders are extremely friendly and fun.  They are informed of all of their dishes.  The chef is personable and comes to see how things were.  The food is awesome.  The scallops are my favorite dish!  He can sometimes create things on the fly if you have a special need!  Great Great place! Right up the road from my house.  It has a neighborhood feel with an ellegant touch! Go! You will not be let down!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Painesville. I loved my meal, and the service was amazing. I don't know why this place isn't packed 24/7. It was a little pricey but well worth it. I had the veal special, and it was fantastic. My boyfriend had a steak that as perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Could not be more happy with the delicious food , presentation and staff.  Always a treat to eat so close to home and feel well taken care of.  thanks Bistro and keep up the good wor!!"}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to everyone!  The staff is very accommodating and friendly.  We ordered from their sushi selection and we were highly impressed!  We definitely will be going again!"}
{"text":"We having been coming here for years and the food quality is top notch. Our favorites are the Cajun lamb lollipops, meatballs, lobster bisque full of chunks of lobster meat, any of the steaks and the Chilean sea bass. If you are looking for a quant little restaurant with fine dining you have found it. Chef and Owner Keith personally visits every table. We have had Megan for our server and she is always so personable and friendly. Drinks are well worth the price and bartender Joe will pretty much make any drink you ask for."}
{"text":"Most may find it fine....I found it lacking.  The food was a great attempt at something that wanted to be farm to table -- but it seems like a close knock off.  Not terribly seasoned and not terribly inventive.   Clearly they are trying very hard and want to serve the community, and perhaps it was just an off night.   I would try it again to give it a shot."}
