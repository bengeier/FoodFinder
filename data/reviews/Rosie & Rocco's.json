{"text":"I had a piece of the pepperoni pizza and it was great! I am a very picky pizza person and the crust was thin and perfect, this pizza reminded me of NYC pizza and if you have ever been there you know what I am talking about, it's a real pizza with fine ingredients not like  the garbage chain pizza places.  An added bonus is that it was reasonably priced and even the employee who waited on me was very nice, will stop at the Horeshoe again just for the pizza!"}
{"text":"Went for a late night snack, and had a slice (1/4 of a large pizza). We tried the Margarita with pepperoni. It is very good, thin crust with a delicious sauce, and excellent Mozzarella cheese. Only down side is that particular pizza was not cut evenly, so that the piece we shared may have been much smaller than 1/4 of the wheel."}
{"text":"I was there 2 days ago and a bit hungry for a slice of Pizza and tried the Breakfast slice ... BE AWARE...!!!!!!  I think I had Food Poisoning after eating the slice of Pizza..!!! I ask the girl that worked behind the counter if the last slice was Fresh enough because it looked like it was sitting there for a while and she said it was okay.. NOT.!!! I started cold sweats and rushed to the bathroom and very doubtful I would eat there again."}
{"text":"Great pasta dishes! The pizzas are very beautiful and unique..I will try the breakfast one next:)"}
{"text":"Let me say that THIS is the spot for pizza!!!! The breakfast pizza is DELICIOUS! Seriously loved poking the egg and having it just ooze out onto the pizza. Everytime I go to the casino, I get a slice of pizza. (I'm going to huge and obese in about a year.. I go too often!!)"}
{"text":"On 12/30/2014 had the Cavatelli & meatballs.  Good size portion, but the sauce needs work.  No taste.  Meatballs were good. Also had the Penne with chicken in a parmesan cream sauce.  Again a good size portion with plenty of chicken pieces but the sauce was very bland.  Probably changing this to an Alfredo sauce will give this dish what it needs"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant after going to B-Spot Horseshoe Casino the day before. Quite honestly if celebrity chef Rocco Whalen's name weren't attached I wouldn't have tried it.  Just looking at it, it looks like a bad knock off of a Sbarro. You know, the kind of quick service Italian restaurant you'd see at CLE airport.  Rosie and Rocco's may not have the fanciest style for a counter service restaurant, but Rocco didn't disappoint when it came to flavor. I had his Crispy Chicken-Parmesan Sandwich ($8.75) and it was one of the best take away chicken parms I've ever had.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, the sauce was flavorful, and the chicken's breading was just right--didn't kill you with nasty garlic aftertaste all day.  They also have pizzas, a meatball bar, selections of antipasti, hand-made pasta and desserts.  I wanted to try the fried doughnuts, but the sandwich was just too filling.  I liked that he offered Aqua Panna water in the glass bottle."}
{"text":"Normally when a place is out of the food I want, I wouldn't give it 5 stars however, the cashier went out of his way to ensure that my family and I were taken care of. He offered suggestions in place of what I originally wanted and had a delicious calzone made... It took a little longer to make since it was not pre made to heat up, so we sat down and he unexpectedly brought it over to us. 5 stars for him. We will come back."}
{"text":"Best pie in Cleveland hands in Cleveland hands down.   Slices are so good you think you're in Manhattan. It takes all my power not to order to every I'm there. , don't forget to tip and try not to blow $400 on blackjack on your way up stairs."}
{"text":"Yes, it's an overpriced food court, but it's local and pretty tasty. I didn't try the pizza (which can be quite a contentious topic anyway), but I enjoyed what I had. I opted for the veggie sub but also wanted to try the veal meatballs. The sub was excellent; all the veggies stood out and it was nicely toasted. The meatball had good flavor and a nice sauce, but they were dry. Not sure if that was a product of sitting around or lack of fat. Service was very friendly and my sub was made to order, which might explain its quality."}
{"text":"I was quite hungry after doing a little bit of gambling in the casino, so I decided to stop into the food court for some chow. After checking out all of the choices, I decided on Rosie and Rocco's! The pizza looked delicious and it tasted the same way. We thought about ordering a whole pie, but after get a peek at the slices, we realized they were HUGE! I ordered the margherita, and it was very good. It had half baby tomatoes on it instead of the usual diced tomatoes. I do prefer the diced tomatoes. Its nice to have something easy to grab in the casino that is not super expensive. A quick dinner for 2 under $10 is always a great thing!"}
{"text":"Good value food court food.  We stopped in on our way through town.  Cheap parking may have lead us here but I can't complain. I ordered the chicken Parmesan and it was light on the sauce. Which is the way I like my grinders, but take note if you like sloppy sandwiches."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant evening at the horseshoe casino, we had late night slices of pizza at Rosie and Rocco's.  Easily the best New York style pizza in Cleveland. Can't wait for the next time we come back"}
{"text":"We were at the casino after a concert at the Q and decided to try out some food. We tried out Rosie and Rocco's because the pizza looked delicious and seemed like the perfect late night snack.  Unfortunately, looks were deceiving. The pizza was just okay for the price. The staff on the other hand was awful. They were very unpleasant. I stood there and waited for the cashier to finish her conversation to then just stare at me with a distasteful look as if to queue me to now place my order. There was no greeting.. \"Can I take your order please?\" , there was no thank you, there was no talking... period. They had looks as if I was burdening them by ordering. If I am patronizing a business, I shouldn't feel as if I am bothering the staff. It was very uncomfortable and I probably will not be back again. Not because of the food, but because of the service. Being that the casino is probably filled with tourists,I don't think this is the representation of Cleveland we are looking for.  Advice for the management.. talk to your staff, teach them proper etiquette."}
{"text":"Dear Mr. Whalen, After an amazing performance at the Q by your Cleveland Cavaliers, I stopped by the casino for a few drinks and a bit of entertainment. Apon leaving, my guest wanted a bite to eat so we made our way to the \"Food Court\"  I made the decision not to buy a burger and fries and opted for a slice of your finest pizza. Lets just say your customer service was quite a disappointment. I ordered 2 slices and a side of cheese bread... not to tough. The lady behind me ordered 2 slices (she was about 60 yrs old) As we waited we noticed your cashier was pretty much mean to every customer that approached the counter. While waiting we made  small talk with the 'older lady\" behind us and she was pretty much thinking the same thing about your service. She was from Pittsburgh and I was embarrassed by to poor service she recieved. When my food was ready they called my number......unfortunately they failed to bag the product. I told your cashier it was \"to go\" and she pretty much had a shit fit because she had to bag the food.  I understand its not always easy to find people to work late on a friday night but come on. Your food is really good and I know you take pride in that.   If your food sucked I would give you one star. But because it was your service, not your food I gave you three.   Hopefully this is corrected and your restaurant will be a strong representation of the city."}
{"text":"Friday night, near closing: I tried to order an antipasto salad and the cashier said \"We're no longer serving pasta.\" LMAO. After a bit of explaining, it took an additional 15-20 minutes to get my food. Apparently the cook had refused to make the salad--the look in his eye said \"I hate this damn job.\" So the manager (who was apologetic) took care of it himself. The food was good enough, and even though the cashier wasn't too well-versed on the menu or Italian food in general, she was kind and pretty damn funny."}
