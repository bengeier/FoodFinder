{"text":"Was there last night for some food and drink to celebrate my birthday :P Well it was my first time to the place too.  For starters we ordered the chicken fingers and asked for some hot-sauce on the side. The waitress lady (i think her name was Ann) gave us a tip that they could toss the chicken with hot-sauce if we want. We immediately went for it ! And wow the results, Man-oh-man they should probably have that as a regular dish on the menu! Couldnt resist it and ordered the same dish again (ofcourse with the chicken tossed in hot-sauce)."}
{"text":"Thanks, but no thanks.   I've been to this place on a few occasions but I'm not a fan. Usually went there when nothing else was open.   The food is less than desirable but I don't imagine many people go there for the food. The service isn't terrible but it is an overall mediocre experience at best.   My friend and I have had some interesting experiences here which include: possibly something put in our beer ( hence our nickname of \"Roofie and Firkin\" ), the girl regular that had a meltdown, and questionable substances found on top of the toilet tank.   Like I said ... Thanks but, no thanks."}
{"text":"What keeps me coming back is the amazing customer service. Management (guy with long hair), is great. Always very attentive and makes sure everything's running smooth - Every single time in there.  The prices are excellent, along with the daily drink features. Wings are great, and the nachos are massive., great local bar, will keep going."}
{"text":"I guess everyone has one of these.  Its the local pub, within walking distance of your place.  I feel like I'm home the moment I walk in.  The staff is just fantastic.  Young enough to be cool but old enough to be more down to earth than a party animal.  The Squire can be busy on the weekends and during big games but its the off times when its the best.  Sit right up at the bar, order one of many draughts, play a game or two of NTN triva and just feel your daily troubles melt away.  The food is the same you would get at any Firkin  and doesn't cost alot.  In the years I've been going I never had a bad meal.  When you just want to relax, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"They renovated, I'll up the review to a 3rd star.  It's a lot brighter and more welcoming now, and I'm pretty sure that they upgraded the menu a bit in the process, as I did see a few more interesting options that I don't remember last time.   Unfortunately, still the same boring tap selection with the majority being Molson owned brands, with the exception of Hop City's Barking Squirrel being the only genuine craft option. Pints come to $8.30 after tax which isn't the greatest deal either. But, it's progress. So 3 stars it is."}
{"text":"Just letting myself and people know Karaoke here is just on Thursdays.  I still must see what it's like."}
