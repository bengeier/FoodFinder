{"text":"I just moved into the area less than a month ago. Originally from downtown Toronto, I usually get a nice fix of AYCE every now and then I get the craving. I was having that sushi craving again, so I decided to dine at Togi Sushi for the first time. I was not sure of which restaurant to go to since Togi is wedged in between two other Korean/Japanese restaurants. Me and my boyfriend decided on Togi. We ordered sushi, and chicken teriyaki to share. When our meal arrived, the chicken was clearly freezer burnt and old. My boyfriend is the one who pointed out it was very dry. Trust me, we have had overcooked chicken and even overcooked our own chicken, but the texture of the chicken teriyaki was like biting into a rubber band. I told the waitress the chicken tasted and texture was like it was freezer burnt. Forgot to mention that the chicken teriyaki was $18, mind you the portion was very small. Anyways, as I shared my concern that the chicken was rubbery and tasted weird as well, ( I even demonstrated me taking a bite, as if I was holding a pork rib that won't even budge off the bone ) she insisted that that is how chicken is. She started to shred it right in front of me and told me and my boyfriend that this is how you are suppose to eat it. I was baffled, I told her right away that I would let our neighbours sitting behind us have a taste of the chicken. Then, all of the sudden she was like okay, I will cancel the order. When we left, my boyfriend told me that when we were ordering, one of the customers were complaining about their meal being tough and strange. I told him next time he should take the hint and we should leave asap. Horrible experience. I have worked in restaurants before, and I have never came across such poor execution of an overpriced and simplified meal. Not to mention, the fact she is justifying the freezer burnt chicken by shredding it into pieces that look like beef jerky and telling me how I should eat it. No. Never again. Chicken is a huge NO, sushi was meh, and service was horrendous."}
{"text":"Toji has a great family atmosphere and the food is fresh and delicious- totally kid-friendly. My favourite dishes are probably the Tempura and the deep fried yam sushi. Overall, good value for the money."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice & I was torn between giving 2 stars or 3 stars. The restaurant is very nice inside, the sushi was presented nicely and the staff was lovely.

I would argue that the price was too much for the size and quality of the sushi. The non-spicy  sushi was decent, however the spicy sushi was not spicy. I had dragon rolls, spicy salmon and a couple other rolls which were all 'ok'. I probably wouldn't go back unless my favourite sushi place is closed...and I wouldn't order anything advertised as spicy."}
{"text":"Hey Yelpers,
This is my first review on Yelp ever and I've decided to compliment Toji Sushi as I order and thoroughly enjoy their amazingly friendly service and great sushi several times a month. 

I would recommend trying the Rad Dragon, Spicy Salmon Roll, Spicy Tuna, Kamikaze, Caterpillar...just to name a few :)

I would wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone looking for great sushi and great service in Etobicoke. Give them a try and don't forget to be gentle and kind with your feedback and many people here tend to forget that this is a family business who depend on these reviews. 

I hope that helps!!"}
{"text":"They always make me feel at home as soon as I walk in the door. Smiles and instant greetings.

It's one of my happy places.

Come in regularly and you'll soon see..."}
{"text":"Great place conveniently located about 10 minutes away from my workplace. I went there today with a group of coworkers for lunch and thoroughly enjoyed myself.

To begin, please note that this restaurant is located in a strip mall between two other sushi restaurants. When looking in the restaurant from outside, the first thing you will see is an abundance of beautiful plants in the entryway. Each table had a small (real!) orchid decorating it, and there is the requisite Korean dramas playing in the corner for those who want entertainment.

For lunch, I ordered the sushi and tempura bento and requested no shrimp in my tempura. To date, this has been the only sushi restaurant I have been to which has actually listened and remembered to not include shrimp in my order! For $16 I received:
a miso soup
a salad
6 pieces of California roll
3 pieces of yam roll
5 pieces of deep fried sweet tofu
6 sushi
and about 7/8 tempura pieces
plus refreshing watermelon spears as a palate cleanser at the end!

Each dish was beautifully presented and the food was rather tasty. I normally eat a lot and I was stuffed. Some of the sushi pieces had a bit too much wasabi on them for my tastes, but I cleaned the whole box. The only thing left behind was the decorative deep fried angel hair decoration!"}
{"text":"Food: OK. The average sushi place.
I ordered salmon teriyaki dinner. Salmon was very dry.
Portions are small for the cost.

Price: too expensive for what it is $18.95 for a teriyaki dinner.

Service: OK. Nothing outstanding"}
{"text":"The fish was VERY fresh and the food was delicious! The tempura was light and crispy, and the presentation of their meals adds an extra flare. Their prices are good, the place is cosy and intimate, and the people who work there are really really sweet!! Cute little sushi place that I'd highly recommend :D"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful place to eat. The sushi was beautifully crafted and fresh. The salad was much better than any other place I've eaten sushi. I had the tempura combo and my dining partner had beef teriyaki, both came with soup and salad and we were brought a dish of some complimentary spicy pickled radish. 
I will definitely be returning here. Our server was attentive without hovering."}
{"text":"Definitely 5 star for Toji Sushi. Great food, friendly service and very reasonable prices. This is one of my favorite places to eat and I'd strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in TO. I got the hae dup bap ($16.95) for take out. Even it is a bit expensive, its totally worth it. If you like poke or bibimbap, i highly recommend this dish. Rice with a lot of vegetable and raw fish(sashimi)."}
{"text":"Nutritious and delicious. Love the Animal planet in the background. Reasonably priced special rolls in a sushi restaurant in the Etobicoke area. Good service...she may  be 64 years of age but she moves like a 34 year old...or it could be the pink nikes...? Love it!"}
{"text":"Since my last time at a Toji, I've been back multiple times with my friends and family - it's now one of my favourite spots for sushi in Etobicoke. I find that the quality of their sushi has been getting better each time I go and you can tell even their presentation for their dishes have improved (even though they were good before)!  The staff is also helpful and attentive as well. 

I recommend sharing a bowl of their delicious tempura udon and a sushi & sashimi combo - my go to meal with a friend or two :) oh! Their house salad that comes with your miso soup... Is the best compared to other sushi restaurants!"}
{"text":"I came to Toji for the first time the other day, having just moved into the area we were looking for some good old sushi! 

Toji has a great family run atmosphere. The service is good with that cute Japanese touch to it. 

The prices are pretty average an comparable to a lot of sushi restaurants. I ordered a dinner combo of beef and rice and my husband ordered the chirashi. Both dishes were prepared well. The chirashi had fresh good quality fish and the beef with rice was served nice and piping hot. Just the way I like it. Full of flavour as well. 

For dessert we decided to celebrate our move in with a scoop of green tea ice cream. You definitely can't go wrong with ice cream, EVER (unless you're lactose intolerant) 

For dessert they also give you a complimentary sliced up orange, a thing I've seen done at a lot of Japanese restaurants. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time for lunch. The food has always been pretty consistent. Very rare for me and my friends to order something we don't like.

Our favorites are the Kani Salad, Shrimp Tempura, and we've pretty much eaten most of the specialty rolls and they're good (not exceptional but good).

My review leans toward the favourable side because I'm a regular, but there are times when the service is left to be desired. We once had to wait about 45 minutes for our order even though we kept telling the lady we were in a rush. In the end we had no time to eat it and had to pack it to go and we were all late for work. We also received the wrong salad in that order. The lady is very nice, but her English can be very hard to understand."}
{"text":"We've only been to Toji Sushi once. Our friends recommended the place and we decided to give it a try. I must say, the food was awesome - we tried a couple of dishes and then even ordered more! The lasy serving the food does not speak very good English, so it was a bit hard to understand her (or her understand us) at times, but this was a minor inconvenience and did not ruin our food experience at all. I think we will be back."}
{"text":"One of our fave places to order take-out from. Quality is always great and food tastes so flavorful. I always order the rock star rolls- perfect combo of spicy, crunchy.  My son loves the donkatsu."}
{"text":"I won't eat sushi anywhere else. I love this family owned and operated restaurant. They have a welcoming atmosphere and make you feel like part of the familu"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out and the sushi is fresh and delicious.  They even gave us tea and fruit while we were waiting for our order.  The shrimp tempura appetizer was also very good with light flaky batter.  This is a great place to go when you are hankering for sushi in the Ecoke!"}
{"text":"BESTEST sushi ever! I've been a royal customer for a few years now. Me and my fiancé both agreed that this place serves the best sushi. We go there very often to the point that the owner remembers our names and always bring free kimji and those little sample appetizers for us to try. We've tried a lot of items on the menu, my favorite gotta have to be \"hae dae bup\", basically it's a salad with assorted raw fish, served with rice and their spicy sauce. It's Korean dish (they are Korean too!), so refreshing and yummy. My fiancé loves salmon skin rolls. We were there a couple weeks ago and noticed that they have more new special rolls. I tried some, they were pretty good. I'm strongly recommended... Y'all should try!!"}
{"text":"First time for my husband and I having sushi (no we haven't been living under a rock :)) so we yelped our neighborhood and we ended up wit the best place ever. It was so fresh, so good so much flavour!! Service was amazing! The restaurant is nothing fancy but very clean and nice enough. Definitely going back for more..."}
{"text":"I love coming here I find their menu very good. I'm a very big fan of their salmon , eel and short ribs. Whenever I feel like sushi I come here it's very fresh and always very good. Can't think of a place that's better."}
{"text":"Toji sushi is our favourite Japanese restaurant in Toronto always fresh and delicious, anything that you choose is amazing and delicious my favourite, Las Vegas, Kamikaze, RockStar  always in my order  shrimp tempura and delicious fresh salad and the list go on and on. Outstanding customer service always smiling and checking your table to be sure you are perfect  thank you  always great every time."}
{"text":"I really like coming here.  Their prices are middle of the road so not like cheap lunch places but it's always good.  We've been here a few times.  It's good for take out and good for eating in.  I usually get Hae Dup Bap which I love but last time I got a sushi and sashimi combo.  My hubby had a steak teriyaki bento box.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Honestly don't how this place got rated so high. The sushi were paper thin, the rice was hard, tasted like end of day sale sushi. Miso soup was extremely salty. I even took a picture of the food and posted it on ig to get a free tofu appetizer and I didn't tell the server because I wanted to leave. I paid $16 for their sushi and sashimi bento for lunch. All I got was 3 pieces of sashimi, 5 pieces of sushi, some deep fried tofu, salad, miso soup and 3 rolls."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming to Toji Sushi and each time I have thoroughly enjoyed my meals, the presentation and the overall experience.

My favorite items are the spicy tuna, spicy scallop and spicy salmon basic rolls. Also delicious is the Toji Special roll. They give you a lot of 'free-bees' as part of your order (eat-in). 

Having been spoiled with living in Vancouver and enjoying excellent sushi, I have had a hard time finding decent sushi in Toronto. This place has exceeded my criteria of decent and I consider it to be rather good.

I will continue to frequent this sushi place. I am also pleases with the level of service they provide."}
{"text":"This place is way overrated. A very typical Korean run Japanese restaurant with a generic Korean-Japanese menu. 

Downsides: portions are small. Sushi chef is stingy. Small cuts of fish

Upsides: fish is fresh 

Would not visit again."}
{"text":"Just a short update.. 
Went here with my husband and daughters today and had the very best experience! 
Service was top notch and so was the food, the owner also treated my girls to a complimentary roll and asked me to try their special home-made Kimchi, which was all flavour and freshness. Thanks for making our day!"}
{"text":"Take out was overpriced and the sushi pieces were very small.   There are other sushi places in Etobicoke south that provide better value."}
{"text":"3.5-4*

I thought this place was hospitable (nice waiters), better value than many sushi places (meal came with a soup+salad per person), and had attention to detail.  They actually cared about presentation here!

There are soo many sushi places within this one strip and there's even one in the same plaza.  So if you were to choose, Toji is a safe bet.  Good fish:rice ratio, maki rolls were tight - didn't fall apart, some of the fish on the nigiri did fall off when I dipped it in the soy sauce, so certain cuts were a bit dry.

Spicy Salmon roll did contain more tempura crunch bits, so fyi in case you like this roll.  I didn't mind it, but it was a bit difficult to taste the actual fish.

Overall, my impression was that Toji puts effort and a bit more care and that makes their food more appealing!"}
{"text":"Great experience on 12/27 - three people for dinner at 630 and with an apologetic short wait for a table we had an amazing experience. Edamame as a free appetizer as well as included soup and salad with our entrees. Sushi rolls were fresh, crisp, and the rice had great resiliency. The fish had the correct texture and smooth flavor. 

Finally, we were very surprised to receive a holiday gift of a bottle of red wine upon departure. This business rocks and does right by the community. Wish I lived closer so that I could enjoy this restaurant more often."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time. We had a vegetarian sushi roll as an appetizer which tasted very good! We had a miso soup and a salad before my chicken Katsu don meal and a complimentary tea with an orange dessert. Everything was yummy, service was friendly!

Half way in my meal a shady guy came into the restaurant asking for beer, the server / owner? complied and the man started complaining about how she didn't give him the correct amount of money back. He then raised his voice and began accusing her of not understanding. There were a few of us in the restaurant and it quickly became a tense, awkward atmosphere. The lady handled herself very well, after the argument the guy swore and left with his beer. Aside from that we enjoyed ourselves and enjoyed our dinner. The sushi was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here, ambience is nice, lots of plants lol

Service was slow, miso soup wasn't warm, ordered the tempura roll combo,  so thats cali roll, yam temp roll, and dynamite. The prawn tempura in the roll was not fresh, kind of soggy. 

Im use to the sushi scene in van, so i know I'm spoiled that way. But there has to be better in the gta,

Will keeping looking...."}
{"text":"Sometimes restaurants seem ill-equipped to handle takeout and it ruins the experience... this is what I assume happened the first time I went to Toji because the dine-in food was just fine.

Once again this is Etobicoke, so the rolls are a bit too large, expensive and the place is dead. The presentation of the food was rather impressive and the service was fast even though there were two other couples and it was just the chef taking orders and making food."}
{"text":"Ordered a maki combo, which was ok but nothing outstanding. The toro sashimi was amazingly presented however and the free soup and salad was a nice touch. Good ambiance aside from the movie planet earth playing in the background was off putting as I watched a leopard take down and eat an ostrich."}
{"text":"Toji has a cute family-run atmosphere to it. The store reminds me of a grandmother's house - the shelves are filled with collections of mismatched dining ware and the front of the store is overflowing with potted plants. The decor is a bit cluttered, but in a warm, cozy way.

The food was quite good. The seafood was fresh and the deep fried items were not stale and soggy. We ordered a medium maki boat and particularly enjoyed the spicy salmon/tuna maki (they really packed a punch!) and the deep fried yam maki (think really good sweet potato frittes rolled up in rice and seaweed). 

The meal was a little on the pricier side but it was so worth the quality of the food! 

My one complaint about our experience was a sketchy interaction with the waitress when taking our order: she asked us if we wanted to add miso soups for their menu price and we declined, but shortly after, she brought us miso soup and said that they were 'free of charge'... Would she have otherwise have charged us full price for the soups if we had actually ordered them...? Sketchy business model is sketchy."}
{"text":"Wonderful taste with right quantity and right pricing. All dishes tastes fresh and great service too."}
{"text":"Overall great meal. Would recommend and definitely would come back.

Atmosphere
Lovely mom and pops kinda place. The decor probably could get an update but it was a nice and warm atmosphere.

Food
Delicious! The sashimi was just perfect! Soooo goooood! We also got the Galbi dinner set, well marinated. Soup and salad came with the meal. Salad was good. Soup was okay but not bad.

Price 
Pretty well priced for fish quality. Bill came out to 51 for two. We didnt drink alcohol. Pretty cheap for a Saturday night dinner. 

Service
Fantastic! Food came out promptly. Lots of attention to detail. Very friendly."}
{"text":"The place was clean and service was good. The sushi was presented well and tasted OK. The King Dragon was the best of all we ordered. I think they are too expensive though."}
