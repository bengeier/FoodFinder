{"text":"We just found the Flamingo Palace while looking online for good Chinese close to home.and picked up our first take out for Father's Day! It was great! Great Food!!!!! We are so excited to find a good Chinese Restaurant so close to home!!!! We will be back for eat in and take out!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service.   Very clean restaurant.   Food was fantastic!   Definitely a permanent customer."}
{"text":"Our regular Chinese place was closed for the weekend, so my boyfriend, room mate and I tried Flamingo Fallace.. Literally wish I went to sleep for the night instead. First I specifically ordered cream cheese crab puffs and when I noticed I received just regular fried wontons I became annoyed. And after I tried my orange chicken I was less than happy. My boyfriend's chicken fried rice tasted as if it had been sitting for hours.. Definitely not fresh, or remotely close. My roommates sesame chicken tasted & looked the same, awful. When I brought the food back 3 asian women were waiting to confront me, heated more than I was. I started to explain that the food was terrible and i'd like a full refund. One woman became defensive and interrupted me before I could even tell her what was wrong. She would not listen to me because i \"didn't even try the rice\" as if the old fried rice was about to change my mind on a $45 order of shit. I was appalled with how this woman talked to me and how she tried to make ME feel bad because I didn't like the food. Even after only eating 1/5 of my orange chicken I was sick through out the night and the next morning with diarrhea and nausea. Sorry if it's too much info but I thought I'd be honest and save you the pain and suffering of eating this terrible food. Do yourself a favor and try somewhere else. Noodles & Rice is way cheaper and a million times better. YOU ARE WELCOME!"}
{"text":"I always loved their lunch specials. Their portions are huge!!! And it's all so tasty. I came here for my high school grad dinner and the whole family loved it"}
{"text":"Being right up the street from our house, my fiance and I decided to give this place a shot one lazy night... the food was pretty good, the service was nice (although we got take-out, so didn't experience the wait staff). The restaurant was clean and didn't smell funny (an increasingly common attribute among Phoenix area chinese places). The chicken wasn't overcooked, the noodles were tasty, too. Not bad, Flamingo Palace, not bad."}
{"text":"Well done (American) Chinese and not too heavy on the corn syrup/sweetness like some places. This is probably a 3 1/2 star place that gets the extra half-star based on limited good restaurants in the north phoenix area. Their mapo dofu is quite good, and so is the walnut shrimp, along with their house fried rice. Polite delivery drivers and prompt service. Never eaten at the restaurant but have been impressed that even when delivered the shrimp doesn't get overcooked/stringy during the delivery, but still arrives plenty hot."}
{"text":"I got the Flamingo Chicken and a Puu Puu plater and it was delicious! It was pretty reasonably priced and the sauce that came with the platter was fantastic. I also felt like I could run faster and jump higher after eating here as well. Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood place serving good old school Chinese food in generous portions and with a surprisingly high level of service.

Here it's all about the Mu Shu and the sizzling platters.  Flamingo Palace still provides old fashion table side service where the waitress plates the black pepper beef onto the hot cast iron platter right next you so you can see the steam and hear the dish sizzle.  The mu shu is also wrapped table side.

Don't let the obscure corner location deter you.  The interior is much nicer (though a little worn) than the outside might suggest.

Extra star for the service."}
{"text":"this place gets five stars because the deliver to Vaseo Apartments and for 24 dollars I got fried rice crab puffs and house chicken, all of which was good and hot. the chicken was cripsy the sauce was amazing and the rice had alot fo meats in it.

Definetly my fav place now"}
{"text":"I had lunch here.

The staff were super friendly.

The food needs improvement.

The lunch specials are 5.95 for a cup of soup, springroll, fried wontons, fried/steamed rice, and your choice of specialty dish (about 10 to choose from).

Flamingo specialty chicken was not too bad. slight hint of peanuts which I like.
Saucy on the outside, some pieces are kind of dry inside.

House special pork (ordered extra spicy)
   not spicy at all
   the sauce is very soy-saucy and nothing much else.

fried rice... bland.
the fried wontons were soggy and thick (nothing crispy about them at all),

The spring rolls were too yucky for me.
I think it was the seasoning of the stuff inside.

The only good part about my meal was the sweet and sour soup.
I had better soup, but it wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I LOVE Flamingo Palace.  My family has been going to this restaurant for years.  This is my first review!  (I'm new to YELP)

Their are always super fast, service is very friendly, and the food is the best part.  I love the cashew chicken (spicy)!!   This is the best Chinese restaurant around."}
{"text":"We decided to try this placed based on the good reviews here. It was awful. We ordered a few items from the menu for take out and we were truly disappointed.  The sauce did not come on the chicken and the chicken was EXTREMELY dry. We couldn't eat any of it.  Total waste of money."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed.  After seeing the establishment for years, I finally decided to try it after reading the reviews.  I ordered the orange chicken, the Flamingo special chicken, the BBQ pork fried rice, and the fried wontons.  The Flamingo special chicken was an over-fried slice and diced chicken breast, so dry that it was almost like a greasy beef jerky.  The onion and garlic sauce served on the side tasted like a burnt soy sauce.  I had to soak the chicken in the sauce for 20 minutes to make it somewhat edible, but burnt beef jerky was not what I was hungry for.  The fried rice was ok, with nice pieces of traditional chinese BBQ pork.  The only problem was that it stuck together so much that the rice was more like a giant rice cake than fried rice.  I seems as thought the rice was pre-cooked way too long.  The fried wontons were your typical fried sheets of wonton wrapper with a sweet and sour sauce that tasted too much like ketchup.  The orange chicken was decent, with the sauce being very flavorful.  The chicken chunks were a good size, and of all the items, this was the most appetizing.  It was nice that the dishes came with white meat, and I was not charged additional for white meat like some other chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Anyone who rates this 4 stars is an idiot. I probably would have given it 2 stars based on the fact, that they serve the exact same generic Chinese as everyone else. But then add in the \"cheap factor\". I ordered a ton of food, and your delivery driver (whom I tipped) doesn't even give a single packet of soy sauce!!! Really??? Well on the plus side, I won't throw my money down the toilet with this company again"}
{"text":"It was good! But the wonton ooOomg there was nothing inside and I called the restaurant and the lady said there was only Tiiiiiiiny tiny bits of chicken! LOL Wich is a lie cos there was none!!! 
Why Lie?"}
{"text":"My friend and I went there last weekend.  She got her food just about when I was done. She wanted her soup first.  The waitress brought the soup, meal. And egg rolls all at the same time.  By the time she had her soup her meal was cold.  The bathroom was horrible and unclean."}
{"text":"My Hubby & I have ordered take out from FP at least 20-30 times since we moved nearby about 2 years ago. We have yet to actually go inside, maybe 1 day, but honestly when we are craving Chinese food it's usually because we are too lazy to cook/go out so delivery is always our go to option. Plus they have free delivery! 

We have ordered a variety of items from their menu but our favs are: cashew chicken (w/extra cashews), flamingo special chicken, egg fried rice, veggie chow mein, beef & broccoli & their egg rolls. You can't go wrong if you order any of them, yummy!! 

Love you long time FP! :)"}
{"text":"We love it! My fianc√© and I just moved to the area and were looking for a good Chinese place...we found it. Best chicken and broccoli we have ever had and delivery was fast and service friendly. Would highly recommend it. they are our new favorite!"}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING!!!!  I've had my share of bad Chinese but this isn't even close.  I placed my order for delivery and it arrived at the time they said and it was PIPING HOT!!!  Not lukewarm or just warm it was HOT!!

I highly recommend the Flamingo Chicken.  It's a simple dish but the sauce that is served with it is amazing.  Also the House Special Chow Main is phenomenal.  It's not loaded up with a lot of filler.  It has appropriate portions of meat, veggies and noodles.  The Pork Fried Rice was little salty but with everything else it was still good.

I have found my new Chinese Restaurant!!!!  After living in Seattle for over 20+ years this place can compete with the best one in Seattle."}
{"text":"I liked the food the two times I've eaten there. I tried to order food to go. I am only one person so I don't want to order $20.00 worth of food. Why can't I just order what I want??? I would of picked it up but they will not sell a bowl of soup smaller than  32 ounces. Why can't you just sell a half bowl??? Oh well there are a lot of other places to go."}
{"text":"I am giving Flamingo Palace 5 stars because they have the best food and service of any Chinese restaurant I've tried in Phoenix.  I like Bamboo House and Superdragon, too, but this is by far my favorite.

My in-laws are Chinese food experts.  I never thought we could get them to like Chinese food in Phoenix as they are from New York, where good Chinese food lives.  But they love Flamingo Palace.  Every time they visit us, they ask to go there.

I just had my book club there and they were so awesome!  We had heaps of food and each was better than the next.  Plus, the service was just amazing- this with 13 people in our group.  I had such a pleasant, stress-free experience.  They gladly substituted chicken for pork, and as other people have noted, their chicken is the good stuff.  Also, they are very generous with shrimp, meat, etc.

People in my group actually ordered alcoholic drinks from their ample drink menu, which I've never really noticed before.  I'm not much of a drinker.  But everyone really enjoyed the plum wine.  It was pretty cool that they have some different things to offer than a lot of other Chinese restaurants.

For example, try the house Flamingo chicken.  It is so good.  We wiped out their szechuan chicken, it was spicy and fantastic.  I also highly recommend their pu pu platter and spicy shrimp.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I'm three months pregnant and have been craving some good Chinese food! After looking on yelp, we decided on flamingo palace because it was close by and had good reviews. We were not disappointed. The food was fresh and delicious, and the service was very friendly. My favorite was the chicken chow mein, yum!"}
{"text":"This is the best chinese restaurant we've been to.  You really cannot go wrong.  The lunch special's are worth the money.  $6.45 plus drink."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try since my niece is always ordering take  out. I ordered the orange chicken with white rice, and asked for broccoli and they couldn't add it. Any other place would have added it, like Bamboo House, or China Chili. Very dissapointed!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful, customer service is excellent. When it comes to food delivery it takes longer than usual, but for the great quality of the meal it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"They have the most tastiest food here in Phoenix that delivery is quick fast and really hot delicious"}
{"text":"The crispy duck was aweful dry and all bones chopped up with little meat. The plum sauce was not helping. And the server argued with me that the crabmeat in the crab sauce was real when it was actually overpriced disgusting canned corn chowder with imitation crab. I should of listened to my fiance when he said this place was horrible. Yuck never again."}
{"text":"I usually just get take out from here, but we like the fact that they have vegetarian and seafood options."}
{"text":"By far and away my favorite Chinese restaurant. Friendly staff with great foot at a good value!! There crab wantons are out of this world!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place Chinese places. Old school style, always yummy. Delivery is always early or on time. Old school atmosphere love this place !!! Everything I've had is amazing and flavors are great !"}
{"text":"Love the Chinese food here. I can honestly say when I think of having Chinese they are one of the first places I think of. Love the Sesame Chicken and Chicken Broccoli. Their egg rolls are some of the best egg rolls I've ever had. Good place to eat and also, a good place to get a delivery from. Oh yeah, their dumplings are amazing as well! Will continue to be a customer here!"}
{"text":"My son and I had lunch today at the Flamingo Palace. They have great prices on their lunch specials. The food was very good. We don't care for soup so we both got a salad. The salad came and it was a bowl of lettuce with dressing on it. It was would be nice if the salad had  come with cucumber and tomato.The egg roll that came with the lunch special was awful but the dinners were really good. We will go again."}
{"text":"If you're hungry for Chinese cuisine, I mean really hungry, this is the place to go to satisfy the craving!  You'll get plenty for your $$'s, and the staff is always very pleasant!  if there is any stress going on within the establishment, you don't even know it.  So what that you might be hungry an hour later; go ahead, you'll have left overs I'm sure!  My favorite is the house fried rice with succulent shrimp throughout, and excellently flavored rice. It is a tasty comfort food that can be eaten right out of the to go box, which holds up against even the roughest fork entry!  I call in my order, go pick it up for takeout, and I have never had to wait for it!  The staff is on TOP of it all, making sure the food is well prepared, and delivered unto you piping hot and ready to eat!  The establishment looks small but don't be fooled.  They even have a greeter in a Tank that looks like a white Oscar.*   Looks a little lonely swimming back and forth in the tank day in, day out but really a nice fish and its been there for years.  *Has since passed away since the writing of this particular review.   I call it the Flamingo Mascot.  House Special Chicken, & Sizzling Rice Soup are also favorites of mine as well as many varied items on the menu, and don't be afraid of the pricing either as its very reasonable and won't leave you feeling like you shouldn't spoil yourself once in a while.  Happy Eating in the Palace!  Get it to go!  The service, food, and people here are great!"}
{"text":"We have been eating at Flamingo Palace for many years. We live near enough that they deliver to our neighborhood, making it one of our main go-to options for super busy evenings (this or pizza that delivers).
I LOVE the shrimp chow mein, with abundant good-sized shrimp, while my husband always wants mu shoo pork. We ask them to hold all the rice. With the chow mein and the mushu wrappers we don't want more carbs. But I don't miss the rice, especially if I make a salad or steam some veggies.  The price is very reasonable for the large amount of food delivered right to our door. They might charge us a couple of dollars for delivery, but I always give the driver a large tip. When I call in and order, they might say, \"we will have this to you in about 1 hour\", but they always come within 1/2 the time quoted. We recently called and they said 45 minutes. I warned my husband that they would be here in less than 25 minutes, and they were. I was very happy because I was starving. And it was delicious!! I highly recommend these guys; we take guests there and we have never been disappointed either in the restaurant or at home with delivery. Sometimes I pick it up to go and bring it home myself. This way, I can grab any sauces we might like."}
{"text":"I was kinda disappointed.  I think my expectations were too high based on other reviews and now I'm still searching for a go to Chinese place... For now its Dragon Bowl Inn.."}
{"text":"The Flamingo Palce has really good (non-chain) Chinese food.  I like the MuShu chicken and their orange beef.  The hot and sour soup is excellent as well.    The portions are generous and the service is prompt and efficient.

The decor is well, Chinese Restaurant! but there are tablecloths and the seating is comfortable.

They have good lunch specials for the $ but I like going for dinner as the menu has way more than the lunch items to explore."}
{"text":"Save your money -  after been on hold for 4 minutes and one hour later, finally got food...Tasteless and really below one star. This place really has gone down hill. Save your money and go to Panda Express or McDonald's"}
{"text":"In my ongoing search for great Chinese food in Phoenix this place is a speed bump"}
{"text":"We love this place! My mom and I come here almost weekly and they always are quick which we love and the food is always delicious. We love the main manager/owner (never get her name), but she knows our orders and provides great customer service. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"Love this place excellent service excellent food and great value! This is how it should be and they play traditional chinese music !  Ho Lee Sheet I love this place"}
{"text":"No wait for table even so it was very busy when we walked in. Waitress came to the table not long after seating to bring water & hot tea kettle. Ordered appetizers first & they came with minimal wait. Main courses got ordered the next time the waitress came around. No drink refills were given during wait for meal even so this was the longest wait time. Waitress wasn't seen again until the dinner was served. Rice bowls came as part of the orders. Meal was nice & hot, but portions were average for the pricing. Chop sticks not offered with meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend had the yui shan chicken and I had the orange chicken and a side of fried rice it was delicious! ! And the amount you get for the price is awesome ! Will keep on coming here from now on"}
{"text":"this place is easy overated!!!all of u should try Little Pekins by the 51fwy and Shea.."}
{"text":"The spring rolls are excellent. Ordered the sesame chicken. No sesames on it and pretty bland. Not sure if they use MSG. Got kinda sick after eating. Might be the food might not be."}
{"text":"STILL HAPPY!!   The other day I ordered some Kung Pao shrimp and Shrimp Chow Mein for take out that was honestly dreadful.  I called the next day to complain and was asked what I wanted to do.  So the following day (two days after the original take out) I went back and got replacements for the original order.  They did not ask for a receipt, they did not ask for the original containers back,  ALL they wanted was for me to be a happy customer.  No surprise the food was delicious as always.   Every one has an off-day, it is how you react  that is what I look for.   I am honestly relieved that I can still recommend this place and have my old stand-by when I am in the mood for good Chinese food.   Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly, food needed more seasoning for my taste. I had the beef and broccoli and the broccoli and carrots were wonderfully crunchy."}
{"text":"Flamingo Chicken is so delicious! We will always stop here every time we are in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I'm spoiled having this place down the street. Awesome General Tso chicken. Fast service whether dining in, getting take out or delivery. I've seen some freaky fast delivery outta these guys at times actually. I had yet to find a Chinese restaurant in PHX I was really impressed with until coming here. This place is a gem."}
{"text":"Since moving from the east coast, we've been on the search for good Chinese food.  I fear we're only going to find mediocre at best.  We tried Flamingo Palace on Friday night and at least I could tolerate it and didn't feel sick after.  We ordered the Pu Pu Platter for 2, shrimp fried rice and an order of crab puffs (or as we call them crab rangoons).  The crab rangoons were the best we have had since moving here.  I'm not sure what they are trying to pass off at the other places we've been, but they were awful.  These were excellent.  On the flip side of that, the fried rice was way overcooked.  It was very mushy, both the rice and the shrimp.  I actually fried up some of the leftovers with some soy sauce the next day and that tasted better. The Pu Pu Platter had its ups and downs.  The friend shrimp were overcooked - instead of being a nice golden brown, they were more of a mocha and lacked flavor.  The honey chicken...well that had some good flavor, but it was nearly unrecognizable as chicken and I was afraid to break a tooth on a piece of bone.  Why not use boneless chicken?  Eggrolls were decent.  Beef teriyaki was bland.  I do think we'll be back as there are other things we want to try, and to get more of those crab rangoons."}
{"text":"We just ate here for the first time and it was pretty good it has an older appeal to it clean large fish tank in the lobby and the service was great I would recommend this place and it was worth the price"}
{"text":"The food was great and the price wasn't that bad.  There was a down side though.  I had my food delivered and they gave me beef broccoli instead of beef lo mein.  I called to get it straightened out and the lady tried to blame me for the mistake.  I don't even like broccoli or else I would have just tried it.  She said that she wrote down beef broccoli so that is what I must have ordered.  They are on their way back now it will take 40 more minutes to get my entree.  Somewhat understandable because they still need to make it.  Hopefully my future encounters will be better."}
{"text":"Their fried rice and sticky rice is good. Crab puffs are sub-par. Egg rolls look like they're a day old and been cooked twice. Using imitation crab in their food (and the crab soup smelled like rotten eggs). Sweet & sour chicken and General Tso's chicken were bland as heck. Delivery was fine but the food is NOT worth the price. Felt like we got the food that wasn't used up from the day before. My husband and I love Chinese food. Eat it all the time. This is some of the worst we've had. We spent $70 and threw most of the food away because it was too nasty to eat. We ended up mixing the two rices together with some cooked mixed veggies of our own and that was dinner."}
{"text":"It was a little on the pricey side but excellent food. The chow fun was great and had a lot of meat and quite tasty. I will be coming back"}
{"text":"I have never been in the actual store. I always get delivery.  It's strictly one of those \"I'm too lazy to cook and don't want pizza\" type of places.  As far as delivery goes, it's usually pretty quick. The lady you order from is pretty abrupt but always gets my orders right. The delivery people are always really nice.

As far as the food goes, it's not something I crave. I have had great hot and sour soup there!  Full of meat, tofu and spices!  There Kung Pao dishes are always hot and the meat is really good. I would not get the chow mein. It's really greasy and the broccoli tastes like kerosene!"}
{"text":"My family grew up going to this place and this last time we went we were not impressed. They're quality has gone down. The chicken was tough and gamey, the beef didn't even look like it was cooked thoroughly. The flavors were just not right. My parents decided they want to look around for a new place. I'm so sad. We've been going to this location for 30 years, despite the change of owners, but seems they just weren't up to par this last time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Just to give you a basis for comparison: I've eaten at most of the upper-end Chinese places throughout Central-to-North Phoenix, and this one is up there. The food is excellent; it used to be just pretty good, but I've noticed it getting better and better as of late. The hot-n-sour soup is ridiculously good, and if you like sweet Chinese, the Schezuan chicken is delicious. Portion-size is great for the price as well; I can usually feed my family of 4 for $40 or less, with enough left over to have for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"I went here an hour before closing time on a Sunday, and was thoroughly impressed.  Got the wor wonton soup, kung pao beef, and shrimp egg foo yung.  I hadn't had egg foo yung in years, and this dish was amazing!  All the dishes were delicious.  The veggies were perfectly cooked and still crunchy.  Nothing was overly salty or sweet -- just great balance.   And the staff are really friendly. 

Looks like I found a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The foods is great and they also deliver. I usually get he Happy Family - yummy - but went for garlic shrimp and I wasn't disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the type of place that you probably wouldn't venture into unless someone recommended it. I'm from New York...and this is my \"go to\" Chinese restaurant. It's authentic NY-style chinese food. Cheap. Clean. And delicious! (The decor is plain - but who cares...) Fo'gettabout the chain restaurants and go here."}
{"text":"The flamingo chicken and street noodles are amazing! My picky mother (from NC) even ate seconds of the flamingo chicken. Sesame chicken...eh. I'll have to find another place for that."}
{"text":"Wonderful, distinctive food and attentive waitstaff! The prices are outstanding, especially the lunch specials. The decor is pretty standard, and every meal comes with free hot tea."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese the Flamingo Chicken was recommended by the waitress and is great the mustard is appropriately spicy and sinus cleaning . It is nice to go to a good Chinese restaurant with real tablecloths and good food"}
{"text":"I rarely write bad reviews but I just had to say something. We ordered delivery, one large  sweet and sour chicken, one large Mongolian beef, one order of egg rolls one order of crab puffs and we asked if they had any of those wonton chips and they said yes. We placed the order over the phone and they said it would be 45 minutes, it took well over an hour. When we finally opened everything we realize they only gave us one order of rice, each entree should have came with a box of rice. And they never put any of the wonton chips in the bag. The food itself was pretty bad, the Mongolian beef had a very strange smell, and the sweet and sour chicken was falling apart. The egg rolls had a horrible Spice in them which made them nearly inedible. Then we discuss the price and realize they must have overcharged us, it said on the menu no delivery fee but clearly we must have charged with someone but we have no way of knowing because they didn't include a freaking receipt. Overall this was a horrible experience and we will not be going back here ever again"}
{"text":"We've been coming to Flamingo Palace for years and they are always just as good as we remember. Even my kids love this place, when we give them a choice to go out anywhere Flamingo Palace is always on the list."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food, really enjoy the Kung Pao and the pork fried rice.  One of the better Chinese restaurants in North Phoenix.  The hot and sour soup has some whole shrimp in it."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with the food. It was hot but the chicken was tough and overcooked.  The egg rolls were tough and tasted like they were cooked in the microwave.  The wor won ton soup was passable. I won't order from them again"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place was awful. My boyfriend and I were very hopeful reading the reviews of others before we decided to try it out. First of all, the decor is awful and in desperate need of an update... From the pepto bismol walls to the green booths it's just not good... Food wise, we had the dinner combo of sizzling rice soup, pu pu platter (which tasted just like it sounds), and the flamingo chicken for the entree... It also came with fried rice and some other small shrimp dish which turned into a disgusting gelatinous goo (see uploaded picture)... The chicken had a nasty oily flavor to it like it had been fried too long and just doused in sauce to mask the flavor. The only decent thing we had was the fried rice which the rice was over cooked but ok... Service was mediocre... Our drinks NEVER got refilled and nothing but a sorry when they noticed we didn't eat hardly any of the food. $40 bucks later we left disappointed and disgusted. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I love the food at Flamingo Palace!  Especially the House Special Chicken, Walnut Shrimp, Hot and Spicy Shrimp, Szechuan Beef, Sizzling Rice Soup, and the Hot & Sour soup.... just to name a few... *wink*

I've been going there for YEARS AND YEARS!  

The service is lightening fast, SUPER friendly, and the food is really great!

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars- is that the decor needs to be updated for a 'fancier' experience, but when you are having a meal with family or friends, you're not looking at the pink walls anyway! 

Two thumbs up, Flamingo Palace!  I loves ya!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 20+ years and have never had a bad meal.  Their chicken chow mein is superb, the egg rolls are the best I have had in any restaurant ever and the dumplings are what you would get if you went to someone's home of Asian decent and they made them for you.  My husband knew a man in college who was Asian and a lot of the food he made is very similar to this style and quality of cooking especially the dumplings."}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Good portions, sticky rice perfection, flavorful sauce, krisp fresh veges, What more can we say! Everything was fantastic.  
Only thing would be to have more combo meal choices."}
{"text":"My aunt, cousin, and I LOVE the Szechuan Beef and Sizzling Rice Soup!! It a must have."}
{"text":"Seemed better more for lunch than dinner (I've done both), however, really good food (not the standard from what one would usually expect at Chinese Food places in Phoenix) & excellent pricing considering the sheer AMOUNT of food they pile on your plate! 

Fed me for 2 days! Good place to bring your family, quiet date environment, & for a massive meal w/o breaking the bank. 

I have enjoyed the egg drop soup, orange chicken, beef & brocolli, crab puffs (w/ the hot mustard is delish!), etc... 

Seriously, they have the best food & wonderful  service of any Chinese restaurant I've had in the Valley! AND they deliver!!!"}
{"text":"Good service great egg rolls, good dumplings, pepper beef was my main Meal which was the first time I had it so I have nothing to compare it too but very yummy! Soup they actually made mine special since I can't eat shrimp.  So they earn my future business. I'm pretty sure this is a family own business. They restaurant is outdated and needs TLC. That's really the only things that might be an issue with your experience."}
{"text":"Put back into a corner its hard to find but well worth it cause the food is delicious"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd review of Flamingo Palace. This would be my first time getting to-go from this place. As usual, blown away by the service. I arrived and my food was ready and waiting for me. $23 for Sweet & Sour Pork, Pork Chowmein, White Rice and Egg Flour Soup. Enough for 2 people for two nights, or 1 person for 4 nights. Not a bad deal :) Even got a little Tupperware container for the soup that was reusable.

as usual great service. If you want authentic great Chinese and a friendly atmosphere, GO HERE :)"}
{"text":"My family and friends have been going to this place for to long to say! Love the wait staff they are always happy to see us. The best hot mustard it's really hot good egg rolls. We all have different favorite dishes mine is the shrimp in cream sauce it is a dish that not good to take home the cream sauce separates but I just eat all the good stuff with my husband help. The other favorites are flamingo chicken, spicy shrimp, beef and pepper, beef chow mien."}
{"text":"Disgusting bland overpriced Chinese food. I'd rather eat at Panda Express over this junk. The food is cold and food poisoning will come with the rice. Skip this place and head to Panda Express down the street at least the food is hot there and you won't be hugging a toilet for the next 24 hours after eating there. Staff is rude and rather than fixing any situation they argue with you and actually hung up on me."}
{"text":"I've spent the past year on the hunt for good chinese food near my house. Flamingo Palace, while about six miles away, is good enough and close enough.

The Hot and Sour Soup was more sour than hot - but not in a bad way. Pretty tasty. I also enjoyed the Tofu Vegetable Delight. The real standout, though, was the Flamingo Special Chicken. Loved it.

Our waitress was nice, if a little off. She thanked us sheepishly every time we said that our food did, in fact, taste good. Kind of funny the first time. Weirder and weirder every time after.

Time to reheat my leftovers."}
{"text":"This place has really good food and great prices!  I haven't had a bad dish.  My favorite is the Singapore Rice Noodles! I order delivery from there about twice a week and I've always been very satisfied not to mention how quick they are to deliver!"}
{"text":"If you find yourself craving Chinese food and happen to be in the Moon Valley area at the time, this is a decent place to satisfy that craving. It's Americanized Chinese food, of course, as you would probably guess when you enter and note the old-time Chinese restaurant decor. But the dishes are nicely prepared, the staff is friendly and the atmosphere is very casual and relaxed."}
{"text":"i donno if i just didn't go in on a good day, but eh. We had ordered sichuan beef and general chicken...it tasted exactly the same. Salty and not spicy at all. Fried wontons I couldn't even chew.  The Lettuce wraps were ok...little bland. Only good thing that we ate all of was the hot and sour soup. Everything else we sadly threw away."}
{"text":"Stick to the Chinese food. Haven't been disappointed yet. Stay away from the chicken wings. Tried because a friend of mine loved them & they were awful lol."}
{"text":"Always good food. Consistent each and every time.  Service is pleasant and attentive without being annoying. I always enjoy my food when we eat here. I get a different dish all the time and they never disappoint.  Could use a little remodeling it is very old school traditional Chinese but it reminds me of my old stand by in Brooklyn. In the end good food out weighs  the decor."}
{"text":"There wasn't a single food item that was good. It is the most disgusting Chinese food I've ever eaten. It makes Panda Express seem like a delicacy. George and Sons is the only good one I've found so far in Phoenix but it's so far away."}
{"text":"Flamingo Palace has a great online menu and ordering was very easy. Took my credit card over the phone and even though they said 30 minutes it took 45 minutes, but hey for great Chinese food I can wait an extra 15 minutes. The delivery driver was very nice and the food was still hot!

We ordered:
Vegetable Fried Rice- Excellent
Sweet and Sour chicken- Very good
Broccoli Chicken- Very good
Egg rolls- Good
Egg Flower Soup (egg drop)- Good (but needed pepper)

We will order from here again (and again, and again) in the future!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for good Gemeral Tso's chicken for five years and this place has it! Meaty pieces of chicken, LIGHTLY breaded in a crispy batter with a spicy sauce. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Foods always great. Love the pork fried rice/ sweet and sour pork. Order delivery from them a couple times a week."}
{"text":"Some of the people that work there are rude and rude to customers of certain persuasions ... Very average food"}
{"text":"This place was pretty darn good. They take care of you, they know the food well and its an easy menu to read, the food tastes decent, not the best I've ever had, but enough for me to be excited to fill my hungry appetite."}
{"text":"never has friend rice! i've tried to order it every time and they never have it. annoying"}
{"text":"it's the only chinese food place near our house in the eat24 app so i wanted to try it the other nite. collectively, my husband and i ordered the pot stickers/dumplings/peking raviolis (it has so many names but it's soooo good! and a def staple for me anytime i have chinese food), wor wonton soup (everywhere does it diff so it's iffy if it's done right to my standards), house special fried rice, and general tso's chicken. 

we were worried at first abt the timing of when we'd receive the delivery cuz eat24 claimed it could be up to 150 mins, but instead it was more like 30ish mins thankfully lol.. we were starving that nite, and the FP's chinese food hit the spot :) 

the potstickers for sure were beyond awesome and prob one of the better versions since i moved here from boston. the wor wonton soup was pretty dang good too honestly. the house special fried rice was a tad bland tho for some reason but still worth eating. and my husband is extremely picky abt the general tso's chicken, and he was ultimately impressed w/ FP's version and would order it again. if the fried rice hadn't been a tad bland, i would've given 5 stars lol."}
{"text":"Good service, food was quick, General Tso chicken was crispy  Definitely not too spicy. Kinda wish the waitress had told us that both dishes we were ordering did not have any vegetables mixed in with it - we might have adjusted our order. But it was good."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch specials-- affordable and very generous portions.  For dinner it's also a great option as it's a quiet restaurant focused on their food.  It seems very popular for take-out at dinner time.  The decor is dated, but really-- who cares as long as the food is delicious? Lol
I definitely recommend this place for the lunch specials though if you're able to dine-in."}
{"text":"We have ordered Flamingo Palace a couple of times per month for the last year. Have never had a bad experience. Typical delivery time of about 40-45 minutes, but the food always arrives fresh and hot.

Have never eaten at the restaurant but it is on our list of things to do.

Would highly recommend Flamingo Palace for a delicious traditional Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"I went here almost every week while I was in school at Avalon. They were always so friendly and had my food ready fast. I now go here monthly with my husband. They are always so happy to see me. The staff is great, food is amazing, prices are reasonable, and I absolutely love the tea."}
{"text":"I didn't notice this place for a while since it's located in the back of a shopping plaza, but a friend told me about it so I gave it a try. I usually have a problem eating Asian food, but not at this place. The food is great and the prices are good. It was also nice to see an Asian restaurant that is run by Asian people for a change."}
{"text":"Don't let the decorations fool you... this place is AMAZING!!!
Their Flamingo Chicken and their friend rice is EVERYTHING!!
 If you like soup, I suggest the sizzling soup. 
You can't go wrong here. HIGHLY recommended!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Chinese food place in the valley. They've been around forever for a reason. It's family style, so plan on sharing. It's much more fun with a group because you can order more choices. Only four stars because they could use some interior updating. Also, only plan on drinking beer or sake if you want alcohol because the other choices agent good."}
{"text":"Their food is always wonderful and service is outstanding. I ordered Kung Pao two (chicken and shrimp)."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in town


This restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. 
I step inside and is like going back into time. It feels warm the food is delicious, the portions are just perfect. My family enjoys the fried rice, chicken and broccoli, sesame chicken and the Flamingo palace special. We have our favorites .They keep up with your water and they come to the table to pack your food if you don't finish. Polite and kind.

I love it here"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years off and on.  I used to live close by and went often.  The quality of the food started to go down and we stopped going.  Then they changed owners and it's ok to eat there again.  

Flamingo Palace is just what you'd expect from a strip mall Chinese restaurant.  The food is so-so and the service is pretty good.  We really like the hot and sour soup and the Flamingo chicken.  

I can say that through the many, many times that I've been to Flamingo I've never had an experience that made me NOT want to come back."}
{"text":"I would've given this place a 5 star rating but my issue was that we ordered for take out for an event and the pickup was supposed to be at 1230pm. I got there and they didn't have the order ready only stating that payment hadn't been received. I was disappointed and had to wait an additional 20 minutes for food that was supposed to be ready at 1230. In Dining experience is always good but bad take out service and will not order take out again."}
{"text":"Tried to order twice from here cause I liked what. Have gotten before. But they seem to have closed.  Tried to order from here again tonight. Waited 2 hours and no food. I will never order from them again. They suck."}
{"text":"First time eating here and used Yelp reviews for a good Chinese restaurant in the North Valley. Wow! The food is really good. We did take out and it was prepared quickly, precisely and packaged so the entree wasn't swimming in sauce to get soggy. We had the Flamingo Chicken which is fabulous. Big chunks of lightly fried chicken in a brown garlicky sauce. We also ordered Beef and Broccoli which was prepared with thins strips of beef and lots of crisp Broccoli. The Flamingo House Fried Rice is really good. It has pieces if pork, chicken and small full shrimp not pieces of shrimp. The portions are generous. The prices are very reasonable for the quality and amounts you get! It was so good we went back the next day!!! This is by far the best and my new favorite for Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Dumplings are great, definitely worth ordering. The pork fried rice was OK, edible but nothing to die for. Wife enjoyed the pad thai. Service was great."}
{"text":"About a week ago I had the pleasure of ordering pick up from this establishment! I read the reviews on Yelp so I had several ideas on what was recommended by others to have. Some reviews weren't great but we all have an off night! I have to say my expectations weren't too high considering some of reviews. I was very happily surprised by the quality of the food, portions and overall the flavor of the food! When I ordered over the phone they were polite and helpful even though they were closing in 45 minutes when I ordered. When I picked up my order it was ready and still nice hot!! Once home I was impressed with the flavor of the sauces, amount of meat in the portions and freshness of the veggies! Great job guys!! We will be ordering for pick up again!"}
{"text":"So we have been ordering Flamingo Palace for the last 15 years believe it or not! One of my first apartments was really close and I worked across the street. Once again I find myself nearby and I've probably had it once a month since I moved in April. I love the crab puffs, potstickers and hot & sour soup among plenty of other things here! Unfortunately my orders have to be without chicken, beef, or pork now but luckily they have lots of seafood and non meat options. This used to be our fancy Chinese food date place if you know what I mean ;) *winkface*

When its rainy like it has been who wouldn't want some yummy soup delivered!?!? You can keep your Chino Bandido I will keep my Flamingo all to myself thx."}
{"text":"We love this place. We live across the street and this is our go to Chinese food place. We always get the hot and sour soup, chicken chow mein, beef and broccoli, and sometimes the pot stickers. We have dined in and had take out. Great place and for the most part they have quick service."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here before and always pretty good.  This order, the egg fried rice was cold and they gave me 2 pieces of lettuce for my lettuce wraps.  I guess I need a new place."}
{"text":"Fast delivery, but lacked in quality and I found a hair in my food. Horrible first time experience."}
{"text":"I was tempted to go with a one star on this one, but I finished SOME of my dinner.  We ordered delivery from this place tonight and it was pretty awful. The delivery driver was super nice, but it was all downhill from there. We ordered egg rolls, hot and sour soup, General Tso's chicken and vegetable chow mein. The egg rolls were fine, nothing exciting. Good crispy wrapper, not over-fried, with a flavorful inside. According to my BF the hot and sour soup was great. However, the entrees were really terrible. The General Tso had no spiciness at all and the sauce was very gelatinous. It was almost more like a hot and sour sauce, with almost a ketchup-y aftertaste. The breading was soft and mushy (which I guess is to be expected for delivery) but the chicken inside was super yucky. WAY overcooked, rubbery nuggets of chewy dried out chicken. I ate about three small bites and gave up. It was probably the worst GTC I ever had. And I've eaten a lot of bad General Tso's Chicken. The chow mein was edible but not what I would call good. It was almost flavorless. The veggies were ok and had more flavor than the noodles, but overall it was little more than something to chew and swallow, not really enjoy.  I definitely wouldn't try this place again. I guess the quest for decent Chinese food delivery continues."}
{"text":"The reviews on here are fake and written by the owners... The food here is not good at all and the staff are idiots. Never coming here again... Ever."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in north Phoenix, always get the Szechuan beef, crispy spicy, awesome, crab puffs and dumplings are great, try the sizzling rice soup too"}
{"text":"Tried several chinese restaurants in Phoenix and actually gave up trying to find a place I liked for the past 6 months or so because I so grossed out by every place I went.  

THIS PLACE IS GREAT!! So glad I gave Flamingo Palace a try, the other reviewers were right!  

The Flamingo Chicken special was VERY, VERY, VERY DELICIOUS!  It was hot, fresh, and just all around great.  Also tried an egg roll and a crab puff/rangoon, also pretty darn good.  Best chinese joint I've found and it's so close to my house I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Based on fellow yelper's ratings, we gave this place a try, it was good in parking, service, and quality of food. I think we found our new Chinese food restaurant. Thanks everyone."}
{"text":"Almost a year to the date as my last review. funny

I took the family here for a late bit before heading home. The service is perfect, the place is clean, the food is good, the $ is great. 

What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst foods I have eaten in a long time. I ordered the lunch special 16 spicy shrimp. The egg roll was cold, the wonton was hard and cold. The special included fried rice, also cold. Was told 45min for delivery (we are only 2 miles from restaurant) food arrived in about 30, so that was nice. But it is like they served yesterdays Chinese food today. The only hot part of the dish was the shrimp. The Egg Flower Soup had ZERO flavor and was hot so that was nice. I will honestly try them again just because there are so many other good reviews, but I think dine in would be the way to go."}
{"text":"I just ordered from Flamingo Palace, delivery was quick, food was hot and delicious.  The crab puffs are the best I have had in a long time.  I will keep this place on my list of order out for delivery!  The prices are very reasonable too! Thanks Flamingo Palace for a great at home meal on a rainy night in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Ordered food here on Wednesday and wanted to leave my review.
First I ordered delivery, there is a $20 minimum food order in order to get it delivered, which honestly is a lot of food for one person. It would be better if they had a certain radius they delivered to for free, and then add on a minimum for further away. Delivery took 30+ minutes.
Second I ordered Kung Pao beef (I asked for extra spicy), dumplings and spring rolls. The spring rolls were very good. The dumplings were luke warm, and had a very weird burnt plastic after taste. The Kung Pao beef was not spicy at all, and had more vegetables than beef. As well there was a \"spicy\" mustard that came with the meal, but that was more of a horseradish sauce.
I was disappointed having spent 25 on food and delivery for some cold, non spicy food.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5...but Yelp doesn't allow half stars and I can't bring myself to round up.  You know those Chinese restaurants you see in pretty much every town in America?  The ones that have your standard menu of Kung Pao chicken, beef and broccoli and -insert meat- fried rice?  The ones that do takeout in cute little boxes? This place is a decent one of those and you probably aren't going here unless you're in the mood for some good old Americanized Asian food.  And they deliver!  Just don't expect much from the decor...they are in a strip mall next to Planet Fitness for goodness sake.  

My wife and I split a Flamingo Special Combo and we had dinner for two days.  I liked the appetizer platter with the deep fried honey glazed chicken wings.  The sketchy beef on a stick was amazeballs - kinda cinnamony.  The special chicken was a bit overcooked but quite good as well (better over than under I say!).  I wasn't a fan of the crystal shrimp and only had a bite of the fried rice - but my wife liked it.  Overall we were satisfied - Flamingo is a worthy takeout or dine in option if you live nearby."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurants. The  resturants was very clean. The food came out very hot . We went at lunch time  wasn't very busy at first but  about 10 min later it filled up. They had alot of take out orders going out.We enjoyed the crap puff and  we loved the egg drop soup it  was so good. My boyfriend had the house chicken. He said it was very good. I had sweet and sour chicken which I will get again."}
{"text":"I ordered veggie fried rice and shrimp fried rice and egg rolls. The rice was dry without any season.  I was disappointed with the way it taste.  I asked for broccoli and only got two pieces in the rice.  The rice had very little veggie in it when I ordered veggie rice.  I put soy sauce on it but it did not help.  I eventually threw it away.  We are new to this area and Love Chinese food so decided to go to the nearest restaurant from where we live.  I gave  it 3 stars because the lady that took the order was nice.  I probably will not return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Teriyaki chicken was good, but the beef and broccoli had an odd burnt taste to it and made it inedible. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for almost 10 years now. Always my family's \"go-to\" when we can't decide on where we want to go for lunch or dinner simply because we know we'll always be satisfied with the food and service. 
My family's a big fan of the pupu platter. They bring out a a big platter (size varies with how many people you order it for and the minimum is 2 people) that has egg rolls, fried shrimp, beef skewers on a pot with a flame under it to keep it warm or to cook it longer to your liking, AND my favorite : fried chicken wings with this delicious sweet sauce drenched over it. 
As a kid I loved sizzling rice soup and when I moved here I was ecstatic to see they had it on their menu, as well as the walnut shrimp! Yummmm
Waitresses are always nice and tentative. TIP: if you run out of tea just leave the pot open at the end of the table and they'll come right over and refill it! 
Besides the violin instrumental version of  \"Tie A Yellow Ribbon Around the Old Oak Tree\" on repeat, I love coming here!"}
{"text":"Every time I order they always get it wrong . Then when it was wrong . They rolled there eyes at me and said we can see what we can do ."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere. Family style dinners priced right."}
{"text":"egg drop is good and the jasmine tea is good too. Sesame chicken is good! It's ok here had better in NYC Chinatown"}
{"text":"Takeout order so never experienced the location butthole food pretty decent for Phoenix standards"}
{"text":"This place is really worthy of 2.5 stars, as it's passable, neither good nor bad. I ordered the General Tso's chicken dinner portion, and while the portion size was decent, both the rice and the chicken were about as bland (and overcooked) as one could get. It didn't taste \"bad\" by any means, but if given the choice, I would order from some place else."}
{"text":"My family and I occasionally dine at this restaurant for lunch or dinner. Either one is great. Lunch of course will cost less, but dinner doesn't set us back too much. The employees are very nice and friendly. They are attentive, personable, and they check back often to make sure everything is OK. 
We have ordered our favorites there: Broccoli and Beef, Sweet and Sour Shrimp, Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, Mongolian Beef, Szechauan Beef, etc., They don't ever disappoint us in the taste or freshness of their food. It is a nice location, quiet, rather intimate, and clean. We will be returning as we have been coming here for the past 7 years."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for several years, so decided I was in the area with my husband and we would stop by, I had a craving for Chinese food. Nothing we ordered was very good, I came home an hour later and was nauseous and vomited. Very nice staff, but food is not good"}
{"text":"Flamingo Palace is a solid option when you're craving classic Chinese food.  I love the convenience of their delivery option (and their full menu is available at their web site).  They are very friendly and even though I don't order often (I swear, maybe once every couple of months), the delivery guy remembers me and is pleasant to chat with.

My standby is the sweet & sour pork, broccoli beef and house fried rice.  That combo makes at least 3 meals, and I am a sucker for getting to eat cold leftovers out of the carton  :-)"}
{"text":"I'm from NYC where good Chinese food isn't hard to find. I moved here a few months ago and have been on the hunt for \"good Chinese food\" since day one. I can honestly say that Flamingo Palace is the best I've found so far. I stumbled across it when with a friend after a day full of errands. We're both from NYC and in the mood for some Chinese food. We drove up and weren't too sure what to expect, with the large green tinted fish tank, small bar in front lobby and all the pink paint on the walls (it is FLAMINGO palace after all) but when we sat down we were pleasantly surprised. Greeted warmly at the door by Lin and seated promptly by Jose, got us off to a good start.

The hot tea we were served was flavorful and a nice addition to our meal. My friend had the shrimp chow fun and I opted for the triple delight. While I didn't taste my friend's chow fun, he said it was very tasty and it all looked good from my view. His noodles weren't mushy or over done and the per-portion of noodle to veggies and shrimp seemed right on the money. My triple delight was just that, delightful! It was a lovely combination of chicken, beef and shrimp in a light brown sauce tossed with snow peas, carrots and several other veggies. The served it on a plate with a side of white rice in it's own separate bowl. The rice was just the right amount of \"sticky\" and had a great consistency. 

Both Jose and Lin did a great job of taking care of my friend and I. They were on point with water refills, napkins and boxing up our left overs into great little containers. I was very happy to see they didn't use styrofoam to go containers but instead they have microwave safe boxes, both better for the environment and reheating the food later ;-) 

I have visited a second time with my wife and 17 month old daughter and the experience was the same, extremely accommodating, warm and very welcoming. The food was still spot on too!"}
{"text":"It's always hit or miss with this place I've gone sometimes and I love it (typically for lunch) the bean curd is delicious but this last visit we went for dinner with three of us and all of us were disappointed there didn't seem to be any effort and the host and server seemed to not care because it was later in the evening for dinner."}
{"text":"Great food prices are mid range $ -$$ they have been there for years. Can eat in or take out."}
{"text":"Foods pretty good. The place is way outdated in my honest opinion and they should remodel but don't judge a book by its cover. My advice is to go between 11am and 3pm mon-fri.  For $5.95 you get the lunch special which includes a long list of main entrees that come with your choice of Hot & Sour or Egg Drop soup, rice, and Egg Rolls.  It's a smokin deal."}
{"text":"this place reminds me of my first job, a hostess in a now closed chinese restaurant in chandler. everything was exactly the same - the teapots, the placemats ... ahhh, the memories. lunch specials were $5.95 and $6.95 and were a great value - they included the main course plus two wontons, soup OR salad, an egg roll and white or fried rice. everything was very clean and service was extra friendly and quick. drink refills were prompt. i ordered the flamingo special chicken and i couldn't believe the amount of food i received - double what i expected. the hot and sour soup was really good, and really hot with lots of tofu chunks. the flamingo chicken is fried chicken in a garlic and onion sauce ... yummy! like daren, i didn't find any crappy chicken in my dish either ... it was all white meat, not over fried or dry. i did not like the egg roll, but i rarely do - i think they taste like raisins a lot of the time. wontons were crispy and yummy and the rice was fresh. this is my new favorite chinese place for lunch. yay flamingo! keep in mind lunch specials are monday - friday only."}
{"text":"Waited over two hours for delivery then was told that the restraunt had canceled my order and failed to let me know. All of this after they had charged my card for the meal!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight for the first time ever and it will be my last. The dimplings were so soggy by time my food arrived most of the meat fell out of the dumplings. The remaining dumplings left in intact were soggy and not worth eating. We also ordered egg flower soup, very bland and very dissatisfied with the outcome.  One of my favourite soups and it was just so bland. The beef and chicken from the two meals (Almond chicken and beef & broccoli) ordered were also soggy. The only only good part of my $40.00 meal was the sauce for the almond chicken. The sauce was great, the chicken had consistency of a rubber chew toy. Would i recommended this place..... no i would not. I heard.so many great things about this place to only be be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food!  Good service if you have the older asian woman (very petite)
I like the drinks but wish the didnt have so much foam on the top.  I'm paying 5 dollars for 2 dollars of liquid.
Whenever I am seated I always move because they always start placing people nearest to the door and I personally dont like being seated there! I always just move a little bit to be a bit more private with my boyfriend.  
The food is always good when I go!"}
{"text":"Our granddaughter (she's 5) wanted Chinese food on New Year's Eve. We called and ordered to pick up. We got her fried shrimp and also ordered sweet and sour pork and teriyaki chicken. The shrimp was good, sweet and sour pork ok but the teriyaki chicken was definitely NOT chicken. I have no idea WHAT the meat was and needless to say we didn't eat it. We used to like Golden Wok when they were across the street and hoped this would be as good but I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic American Chinese! The pou pou plater is practicly a meal @ $4.50/person. we order a bowl of soup and 2 entrees and were barely able to get onto the main dish. very good. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The crispy duck is probably one of the grossest meals I've ever tried. It was dry, overcooked pieces of duck with bones in it. It comes with dipping sauce on the side which was also gross. Seriously terrible.
My husband tried the Yui-Shan chicken. He also hated this. He said the sauce was bland and while the description stated cucumbers, they actually used pickles.
I've eaten there before and it was ok, but this time was sooo bad."}
{"text":"I placed an order from here a few months back of about $80 worth of food. Everything turned out ok that time, but when it came to ordering $26 worth of food which, actually comes out to $43 after all the charges, \"inclement weather\" prevented them from delivering. It's Arizona!!! 83 and sunny!! Explain how that is inclement weather! Now I have to wait for my order to be refunded, which of course takes up to 3 days. Thank you for not caring about the average person."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. Was a loyal fan of this place since 2012 and have been telling people it's the only place I can find Chinese food like home(NY). Now I will tell people to stay away.

You shouldn't advertise coupons in current issues of magazines if you aren't going to honor them. 

You've also delivered to my house many times before and suddenly you don't deliver to my area. I don't live far at all. I'm right on Bell, a short distance away. 

The best part? I was still going to order from you. Because I was really craving your food. I placed the order and then afterwards saw so many recent reviews from people who received the same bad service.

It all left such a sour taste in my mouth, I called back cancelled the order.

She could've care less. If anything, she sounded excited...

As someone who formerly used to work in customer service for many years and was not a fan of it, I understand the underlying sarcasm in her tone, and it was very disrespectful and unprofessional. Which is what prompted me to make sure everyone knows about this experience.

I read so many recent similar reviews to mine. So sad, but the management is terrible there now."}
{"text":"The food is exceptional and the delivery is fast!! My favorite is the house chow mein! So much flavor and meat!! I highly recommend this for exceptional Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to go here, after seeing the Flamingo sitting in the same spot for YEARS.

This is your typical chinese place. It's not flashy, like PF Changs, which is a good thing in my eyes.

The decor is what you would expect. Nothing flashy. Giant fish in a fish tank, that wanted to eat me.

The food is where it gets a little sketchy. We started off with the PuPu Platter, which was tasty. Eggroll, Honey Crispy Chicken, steak skewers, and fried shrimp were all delicious. My house special chicken ( a breast with white/dark meat deep fried and served with a sweet-garlic sauce) was tasty, but rather greasy. Made for great leftovers! 

Sarah has the calamari, and that was a huge mistake. They kept on the filament  that exists on the calamari, and that made it incredibly chewy and hard. Blegh. Terrible.

Service was great. But really, I've had much better, Abacus Inn is miles above Flamingo."}
{"text":"My husband & started dining here over 18 years ago and really enjoyed the food  flavors  atmosphere and prices. We have moved since then,but were recently in the area again and thought to do take out.We called in our usual order, received it in good time.The place has not changed visually.But to our surprise, when we began to dig in...the offerings were less than previously experienced. There was no garlic in the ' garlic sauce' in several dishes,.there were way too many 'filler' over cooked veggies in the Cashew chicken...the meat in all was not good chunk/slices of white meat...just squiggly pieces of ..? The House Special Fried rice was barely'fried' and ALOT of it , not much decent meat pieces. Sadly, we probably wont go back."}
{"text":"it was our first time to order their lunch special for delivery yesterday. The chow mein and Flamingo Palace chicken was really tasty so those were good. We were quite disappointed with the crab wontons because it was soggy and bland - same with the egg roll and egg drop soup. It tasted like water with food coloring in it. Not going back. :("}
{"text":"I just discovered this Chinese food place right in my backyard. It is so close I can't believe that I have never seen or even heard of it. It is tucked away in the back corner by a gym and since I don't go to that gym, or any gym for that matter, I obviously never came across it. Well, after doing some research on this place and another close Chinese food restaurant, I went with Flamingo and it was quite good. I only ordered one thing on the menu because I only wanted to put my toe in before diving in. I ended up getting the General Tso chicken and it was quite good. I plan on getting the Flamingo chicken next time. I asked if they provided anything extra for dining in, like soup, crackers, etc, and they said now, which was disappointing. So, I ended up doing take out."}
{"text":"Such horrible service...oh wait, we didn't get any service! We were seated and yes its a Friday night so we understand they were busy, but after 15 minutes of absolutely no service, eye contact, or simple \"I'll be right with you\" we ended up walking out. Not to mention, we saw two other groups that were seated after us order drinks and their food. We got complimentary water. Thanks for nothing! Never coming back."}
{"text":"We eat here pretty regularly. I'm a fan of moo-shu pork, chicken fried rice, teriyaki beef skewers, teriyaki beef, and crab puffs. I generally don't like their lemon chicken or egg drop soup. It's not bad tasting, I just have my favorites. Delivery can be slow, but pick up is super fast. Also, the restaurant is pretty charming in that classic American-Chinese restaurant way :)"}
{"text":"Was in Phoenix meeting a friend who was passing through town.  We needed dinner before she boarded her red eye and before I drove back to Tucson.  Food was excellent.  We shared chicken lettuce wrap, chicken friend rice, beef with snow peas and crispy duck.  Tasty, good service, ample servings, reasonable prices.  If I was nearby, I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. Lots of food for $6.95! 

You'll have to ignore the hideous decor (pepto-bismol pink walls, dated furniture, etc.) but the place is usually pretty busy with lunch crowds. The staff is very friendly, food is decent. Remember: you get what you pay for- so the $7 lunch special with entree, rice, egg roll, soup is not \"high quality\", but just know that going into things and you'll be A-OK."}
{"text":"I wish you could give this place no stars 
The sweet and sour chicken tasted like it came from burnt oil 
The friend rice was literally just plain brown rice that looked like a bad version of boxed brown rice. 
And the noodles tasted burnt too. 
They even brought a large family a bunch of wrong food and then tried to make them pay 180 dollars for it. 
Seriously such a disappointment 
Not to mention we waited 45 minutes for our food and then another 45 for the check. 
So so so so sooooooo bad the service was so bad they didn't even ask us what we wanted to drink they just brang us water with melted ice."}
{"text":"We walked in at the tail end of their night. Only a couple tables were finishing up their meals and I'm pretty sure I was ready to eat the arm off of my date (not enough meat, not worth the effort) or else I would have felt a bit guilty about coming in so late. 

This also meant fresh, hot, well-made food. It took a bit longer than usual to receive our order, but it was completely worth the wait. Nothing had that old oil flavor that I tend to taste in a lot of Chinese food. Prices were fair and the portions hearty. I even enjoyed the tea that they set out. The shrimp in the walnut shrimp were really tasty and surprisingly full sized. They aren't cutting corners and getting those tiny lil' frozen buddies you can find at Costco, thank god. House special chicken was crispy, fucking delicious, and fully satisfied my hangry state. 

My only complaint is that the place is too quiet. Though it was fun to hear the employees yammering to each other in another language back in the kitchen, I found myself speaking in hushed tones which is not in my nature. Blast some K-pop. Okay, so maybe not blast it, but at least turn your zither muzak up."}
{"text":"We are from California and recently moved to Arizona.There isn't much good food here in Arizona, so far(that isn't a chain restaurant).Flamingo palace though has really good food, friendly service, and we always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"My rating is due to the quality of the food. I ordered the sesame chicken and the crispy duck. I ordered for delivery and that was fairly quick. To my disappointment one of my orders was  warm and the other was hot. I thought that was strange. I order the crispy duck which was over cook to the point, I could not eat any of it. The presentation of the crispy duck was poor, it does not look edible. My next order was the sesame chicken combo. The chicken was hot, rice bland in flavor and the roll was over cooked. The roll was chewy and stale to the taste. What frustrated me I the most is I could not take it back due to not able to drive to the location. I chose the restaurant based on their promotion of the crispy duck and other great reviews.Enclosed is one of the dish and my proof of purchase."}
{"text":"wow yes. hands down the best Chinese I've found so far. I was worried bc of a previous order from a restaurant that is not even close to the perfect quality and amount as your restaurant. thank you. loved my general tso and white rice. the sauce was perfect. the amounts wonderful. and deliciously filling."}
{"text":"Mediocre would be the apt word to describe food at Flamingo Palace. I'm baffled as to why this place has glowing reviews.  Tried the Twice Cooked Pork, Flamingo Special Chicken, Szechwan Chicken (it's Flamingo Special Chicken with a different sauce) and some Chicken Fried Rice on different occasions, and all four were average -nothing great.  In fact, I would get my money's worth at Pei Wei or Panda Express. This place should be avoided at all costs."}
{"text":"I love trying new places(especially Chinese) and this place was not good.  We ordered from Flamingo Palace because we were lazy and were looking for the closest Chinese that would deliver. We have only been in the area for a few weeks so relied heavily upon reviews. I ordered a couple of items and everything was super bland.  The General Tso chicken and the Orange Chicken looked identical- IMO- at a good Chinese restaurants, you should be able to tell a difference between general tso and Orange without having to read what the box says.  There was more breading than chicken and hardly any meat in the special fried rice.  I will not be going back to Flamingo even if someone offered it for free and I was 3 days starving.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years and they never disappoint! It's the best Chinese food I've ever had. I love the sweet and sour soup and the crab puffs, but everything else I've tried is good too. The dining experience feels authentic and always comes with hot teapot for the table. Staff is friendly. It's nice that they offer delivery service too. It's truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, not pushy, and I never feel rushed. The orange chicken is my go to but love the Mongolian beef and shrimp fried rice. I only have one visit where the crab puffs tasted very sour like maybe the cream cheese was bad or something because they were inedible. Wish this place was closer to my house because it is trustable Chinese food. Maybe next time we will try the egg rolls instead of the crab puffs maybe the dumplings it depends on what my inner bottomless pit of a fat kid says. It's a really good place to deliver questionable news to someone you love the ambiance is decent the downside is they strategically seat everyone close to each other's tables which I haven't yet figured out their process. All I know is no one is ever seated in the back and everyone is as close to the exit. Doesn't bother me though."}
{"text":"Flamingo Special is my favorite! It reminds me of the twice cooked chicken I would get from the old Chinese
Place that use to be outside Metro Center as I grew up. Shrimp fried rice is yummy!! Just quit getting my to go order wrong."}
{"text":"Love this place. The decor needs an update but the staff is super sweet and prompt. Crab puffs are always out quick but when we are in the mood for pot stickers there is a wait as they make them fresh.  Very worth the wait. Kung Pao Beef is my fav!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This might be a star to high, but honestly when you can find good Chinese food that can deliver on a consistent basis. I will give it one higher. 

The food is always hot, even when we get it delivered. Now I am only a couple miles from the place, but still!. Other places Ive gone has horrible food and it was almost cold. Ive eaten in and always have gotten good service.

I have tried several things on their menu- the special beef is awesome. The schezwan anything is good too. I really like the wonton soup. the potsickers are the best. 

I will of course be back and my search for great Chinese food is over."}
{"text":"Well I tried this place for the 1st time.. and I have to say.. crab puff.. good... dumplings.. good.. eggrolls.. not so good.. 
$37 take out order including tip NOT WORTH IT.. 
I couldn't even eat the szechaun shrimp and scallops.. HORRIBLE.. I had 2 bites and I was nervous to eat the rest cause there was a funny taste.. nothing like szechaun I have ever had ever.. no veggies.. just juice and prob 10 shrimp and 6 scallops in a big container of juice. 
Sooo I guess I will continue to search for a good chinese restaurant in phoenix."}
{"text":"The Singapore rice noodles are so splendid that I would willingly repeat the two-hours-plus round-trip on the bus required to dine here.

The chile in the noodles is properly deployed to kick you into the early parts if next week without destroying your taste buds. The shrimps are just-cooked, not mealy. The fried egg is soft and has absorbed the sauce. If I made fried egg that good at home, I would be a fried egg maestro. The pork is the proper red kind. Ordinarily, I would try to get two meals out of this, but it clearly called for living in the moment. (And at under $10, it's plenty economical as one meal.)

The decor is straight out of 1987, which is usually a warning sign for Phoenix non-natives, but 1987 was apparently a fantastic year for Chinese food. Service does what it's supposed to do; the plum wine pour is generous; and the packages fortune cookie is neither stale nor inane. Just getting a fresh fortune cookie is splendid."}
{"text":"This is kinda messed up because I really don't like take-out Chinese food, but for some reason I was craving it...oh yeah, I saw a commercial for an eg groll and that sounded so good! So we ordered from Flamingo Palace based upon Yelp reviews, and I have finally found a Chinese takeout place I love! My problem is that the sauce is usually way too heavy and salty. However, my chicken and broccoli dish was perfect, and my husband's Flamingo Palace Special was superb. The meat was high quality. They even have brown rice! The spring rolls were decent; a bit too dough for me. I would have liked more filling. Same with the egg rolls. But still...my fave Chinese takeout by far."}
{"text":"Oh boy!' This place is fabulous!! So yummy Jose and Lin work so good together!! I had Flamingo Chicken and Sizzling Rice soup with an order of Egg Rolls I have been searching for a place like this 

It's a little hidden but once you find it you will always come back!! 

Thank you Lin Thank you Jose"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here last night although they took about 45minutes to get here, it was worth the wait. 

We ordered:
Flamingo Special Chicken: Delicious, chicken was crunchy and juicy. 
Chicken Chow Mein: My son loved it he loves noodles and I tasted it it was tasty. 
Wonton Soup: Husband is a new yorker so he wasn't very impressed he thought the meat had too much fat still on it but thought it was okay. 

I'd give it 3 stars because they took so long and because my husband wasn't"}
{"text":"Flamingo Palace is the closest thing to East Coast Chinese food I've found. The house chicken is super tasty and they have really yummy rice.
Yes it's a little worn inside and that fish in the tank needs a bigger tank, but it's well worth a visit. Delivery was also very quick."}
{"text":"Only giving one star cause I had to. We just threw away all the food we got out of fear of food poisoning. We ordered the dinner special and the appetizers were horrible, the crab wontons had no crab in them. The fried shrimp was so gross, just fried greasy batter. The shrimp fried rice was very bland and all the meat just fell apart, which is why we threw it all away.. Not even fell apart more like disintegrated. Would never order from here again."}
{"text":"Yelp. You let me down. We ordered the General Tso's Chicken and a side of brown rice. The rice was way overcooked and still had a ton of moisture in it. It was nearing the state of porridge. 

The chicken was very bland, and it was indicated as a spicy item? I found ONE chili out of the whole large batch. The chicken was supposed to be deep fried and covered in sauce. However it was soggy and not crispy what so ever. Almost as if it was sitting out for an hour. Ive come to realize that this soggy texture only happens when theres too much water in the sauce. The breading absorbs the water much faster than if it were a thicker sauce. 

Ive eaten had a grip of Chinese places and for some reason there are NO good Chinese food places here in AZ. 

If you want chinese food head to Pei Wei or something because this place is bad."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. The food sucks. I ordered shrimp with lobster sauce and Crabmeat a la Cream soup. The soup had neither crab nor cream. It was chunks of imitation crab mixed into what appeared to be egg drop soup. So disappointing. The shrimp with lobster sauce did not have lobster sauce. It was cooked shrimp drenched in a brown watery sauce and crowded with red and green bell pepper chunks that tasted like they had been soaking in water. I have never seen a shrimp with lobster sauce that had bell peppers. I couldn't eat it. It was so bad.I am never going back and I won't recommend this place. I think they are scamming the public because people who know good Chinese food would never tolerate this."}
{"text":"For some reason people appear to like this place, from a food perspective I'm unsure why. The service was barely 'ok', the food decidedly on the wrong side of mediocre and the prices let's say optimistic. I won't be going again, MUCH better Chinese fare at considerably lower prices to be had in the N. Valley."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 lunch specials to go. Sat at the \"bar\" and waited on my food. Took a look around and the place was filthy. The path into the kitchen was covered in grime. I could hear someone sneezing SO loud which sounded like it was sent straight into the air or on someones food maybe. Prayed to god it wasn't my order. I contemplated asking for a refund and by the time I was getting up to do so, my damn order was ready. Order came out and I had to fight for an additional chili oil. The food was oddly sweet and incredibly bland all at the same time. I swear I swelled up 6 sizes as I was eating. Had this nasty layer of weirdness in my mouth all day into the night and into the next day. Never going back there again!"}
{"text":"Try their sesame chicken! They have the best sesame chicken in Phoenix by far! I deliver for forming a palace for Postmates and I decided to check it out one day and went with my wife and two sons. Everyone loved the food and we liked it so much that we went back the next day because we were craving the sesame chicken! This is our new favorite Chinese food restaurant."}
{"text":"The food all tastes the same! How do you makes \"General's Chicken\" taste just like the Sechuan Beef? Neither one was spicy, they're both over cooked, and they both have the same bitter aftertaste... How the hell? The Chicken fried rice tasted like they made it with old rice and leftover chicken. The white rice was the only thing that wasn't blatantly bad. I spent over $40 on cheap Chinese that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. I've had better crappy Chinese food at a $10 all-you-can-eat buffet.

Seriously... Skip it."}
{"text":"Do not order delivery from this place! It took over 2 hours to get our order! Not happy at all!"}
{"text":"This is my fav Chinese Restaurant to come and have lunch, dinner with my family the prices is right. The portions of food that you get are really good. Love this places(;"}
{"text":"Advisory:  You can go next door to Safeway and get chinese items from the frozen food case that will taste far better than anything Flamingo Palace is capable of preparing!

This was some of the lousiest \"chinese\" food I've had in years.  My husband and I placed a lunchtime to-go order of sesame chicken, vege egg foo yung, and yu shui beef stirfry. The sesame chicken was a joke as it was completely devoid of any sesame seeds or sesame flavor. Both the beef stir fry and the egg foo yung came loaded with stir-fried pickles.  Now come on... You can search the cuisines of the world and I doubt you'll find many dishes anywhere with stir-fried pickles and cucumbers because they simply don't taste good when made that way!!!  Yuck, we choked down what we could of our three items, then discarded the remainder.  Best part of lunch was the steamed white rice."}
{"text":"This is normally my go to spot but I am so turned off by their service tonight that I will not be back. I ordered takeout and ran in, grabbed the food and took it home with my newborn and young son. I unload the food to realize they did not include the rice. 

I called them to ask if they could deliver the rice that they forgot and she told me she would not because I am 4 miles away and their delivery range is only 3 miles. She offered me a credit for one white rice for next time. I asked if that was really the only option and she said yes. 

I am not about to load up a newborn and toddler to run back their for their mistake. I had to order rice from a place off door dash so the 5 year old will eat dinner. 

Really awful way to end our night! I truly expected better customer service from this place. :("}
{"text":"We've been back over the years. I still really like it. Service is top notch and ultra quick. Food is good. My Szechuan scallops and shrimp tonight (a new dish for me) were a bit on the sweet side and not spicy, but it is what it is. My GF doesn't really understand my allegiance to the place, but she doesn't have any suggestions for better Chinese in the area, so she's down with hitting it up. Also, the crab puffs actually taste like crab. I'm sure its imitation crab, but it's not all cream cheese! Her Hunan(?) pork was spicy and good, although they seemed to have forgotten or were out of mushrooms. We forgot to ask why there weren't any, although the menu indicated there should've been.

If you want decent ambiance, quiet booths, and quick table service (rather than standing in line to order). This is your ticket in the area. See my earlier review for much more detail. 4.5 stars for lack of mushroom without explanation."}
{"text":"my friend and i went for lunch, the costumer service was terrible. The lady kept giving us attitude when we asked for something and she was just rude af! I don't know why she's even in costumer service!! I would never go back. The food wasn't all that great either :/ I would NOT recommend this place (Panda express is way better than this) lol go somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"Only did takeout so can't comment on the dine-in experience.  Food was hot when I picked it up and was fine.  We had beef broccoli, which I thought was bland, fried rice - which I didn't try but which the family devoured, crystal shrimp which was OK and the house special chicken.  The last dish looks like ordinary fried chicken breast, but the sauce for it was very complex and tasty, with scallion floating around in it.  Turned the plainest dish in the group into the best IMHO.

Spring roll was fried and a 2 star at best.

Overall, this is classic Chinese restaurant food and I would get it again.  But I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Flamingo Palace for at least a decade. It is my standard against which I judge other Chinese restaurants.

The egg rolls are the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food & great service. We ordered delivery and when it arrived half of the sauce for the chicken had spilled in the bag. The man felt so bad and kept asking if it was ok. I wasn't bothered by it and said it was fine. About 5 min later we received a call from the restaurant apologizing and said they were going to deliver our meal again. I explained it was fine and they insisted at least bringing more chicken. Shortly after the man arrived again with a fresh order of hot chicken. I was very pleased with their service & the food tasted great! Awesome experience."}
{"text":"1:15 min wait for delivery ..cold terrible food and a 32$ bill. The flamingo Palace is terrible, I will not go back."}
{"text":"Situated in a back corner of a strip mall with door angled in such a way as to easily mislead customers into believing this delightful palace is closed . Once inside the diner finds a pleasant ambiance suffused with soft pink and a cross between teal and evergreen. Also readily apparent is the friendly serving staff. Better than the setting is the great food. The seasonings are strong yet well layered. The ingredients are properly prepared with vegetable that have retained their crispness and flavor. There is no skimping on portions; be prepared to bring home the extras. Special mention should be made of two often overlooked parts of a great meal. This place serves really good tea and absolutely outstanding mustard."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars
Craving some Chinese and don't know of any places around here that were suitable, so we ventured out of the box and tried Flamingo Palace after reviewing YELP of course.

1. The decor and etc has 0 to do with ANY review I give unless it is pure filth, so this place was Clean and I didn't see any reason to adjust my review for that. I also did not get a Salad and downgrade a review for Salads, I try to review on the main staple of any restaurant we go to.. 

And now for my take.. 
Ordered the Pork Chow / Mein. (Lunch Special) Entree = 3 stars. and would go back for that. 

Side Dishes:
Egg Drop soup or Flour Soup - Was actually Really good, nice Flavor without being Scorching hot.
Fried Rice - Dry no real flavor, and couldn't tell the type of actual rice it was.
Egg Roll - Very ehhh , one bite n that was it,, no second chance,, the dipping sauce / duck sauce or whatever was WAY too sweet, kinda like dumping Jello mix in your mouth sweet... Yeah, I've done that before :D

Would I Go back ? Yes when in area since nothing else I know of would suffice for an Entree,,,, Would i travel over 2 miles to go there? No. Would I recommend this place? No. Any suggestions? Add flavor to more than Entree, make Fresh Egg Rolls, and Anyone going here, skip the lunch special and just order the Dish you want .. there is enough for take out, as the plates are huge.. 

Enjoy !!"}
{"text":"A lot of food for the money.  Their hot and sour soup is pretty good.  They offer a lot of variety and you definitely get more than your fair share.  Try them out."}
{"text":"I recently moved and in searching for Chinese restaurants; using Yelp of course, came across the Flamingo Palace.  The reviews are all over the place from 1 to 5 stars, but it is close, so I decided to give it a try.

A second rating will appear in all my reviews in the future as health issues have caused me to be wheelchair confined (power chair) so that is now my method of transportation; thus mobility access will also be rated.

I have to concur with the more positive reviews.  I've now dined here more than 6 times. This restaurant offers a great value at both lunch and dinner. Yes, the decor is dated, and stereotypical; but I'm not dining here for ambiance.  This is not a destination restaurant.  Lunch specials are priced for $6.45 to $7.45 for more than 15 choices.  All include a choice of soups, an egg roll, 2 won-tons, a huge portion of white or brown rice, and the main course.  My favorite is the shrimp with vegetables, which I order spicy; and it is outstanding - a generous number of shrimp served with broccoli, pea pods, mushrooms, carrots, and water chestnuts.  I also recommend the egg foo yung entree - both Shrimp and House Special.  This is not prepared in the traditional manner but is a base egg foo yung with the shrimp, and sauce, on the top - spectacular dish.  The black pepper beef, only tried at lunch, was an excellent dish.  I've heard diners in the restaurant rave about the potstickers, steamed dumplings, and hot mustard, although I have not personally tried them - yet.

The staff are courteous and attentive.  They seem to know most of the clientele by face, if not name; which is always a good sign.  It means people are satisfied enough to return.

For mobility access I award Flamingo Palace a 4 out of 5.  If they see me coming they rush to open the door; always when I leave. They rush to make an accessible table available, moving chairs and tables if necessary; although there are several accessible tables right near the front of the restaurant.  If the entrance/exit was a little wider, they'd probably get a 5th star.  Maneuvering in and out requires a steady hand and slow speed.

Whether mobility restricted, or not, give this place a try; you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from Flamingo Palace last night and it wasn't very good. The Broccoli Beef smelled funny to me so I didn't try it. The Sesame Chicken was ok, but didn't stand out. Neither did the General Tso Chicken. Both fried chicken dishes were extremely soggy, but I guess that's expected for most takeout. White rice was a tad bit hard. Egg rolls were good though. It makes me a little sad to say that Panda Express has the best Chinese food in the immediate area. I wish Shangri-La would open a location on this side of town."}
{"text":"Finally found a Chinese restaurant in my hood! 

We've ordered take out 4 times within the last 2 weeks if that give you any idea of how much I like this place. I don't know how, but the takeout food is still HOT once you get it home and start making your plate. I personally love this, because who wants to nuke something 20 mins after picking it up? Not meeeee. 

Quick service - take out was FAST and the restaurant was packed. Reasonable prices 7-12 range for dinner. LARGE servings (1 order of Cashew Chicken can be 2-3 meals for me. My husband more like 1-2 meals). 

We've been happy with everything we've ordered. Flamingo chicken is my hubs favorite, but we've also done chicken fried rice, egg friend rice, beef & broccoli, kung pao chicken and cashew chicken (mentioned above) and its all awesome. Except the Kung pao - but that's probably my fault because I asked them to not make it super spicy, as I'm not a fan and it was lacking flavor in general. (but like i said probably my own fault.) 

Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!!    I ordered Chicken Fried Rice, General Tso's Chicken, Orange Beef and egg rolls.  Very poor cuts of meat. Terrible Flavor. Cabbage in egg rolls smelled and tasted rotten. I highly recommend going anywhere else.

DO NOT EAT THERE!!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Chinese restaurants I have been to in the greater Metro-Phx area.  The place has a old school look about it so look past the outdated decor and pink walls. Portion are just right. Prices were extremely reasonable considering the potions size you get. Services was excellent, timely, extremely courteous. Believe me, you will feel extremely satisfied when you leave."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Chinese food restaurants in the area. In my opinion, the atmosphere is a little janky, I prefer to just get everything in takeout, but the foo quality definitely excels. They deliver and you can even order via online. The food is reasonably priced AND is delivered PIPPING hot. I love the wonton soup and their BBQ pork chow mein. The only thing I wasn't really fond of was the house special chicken, it was REALLY dry. I'm wanting to try it again just because the sauce was amazing."}
{"text":"The food is good, the prices are very reasonable.  The atmosphere is good and the service is good.  We had the house style special pork (very good), black pepper beef (also very good) and happy family (which was okay).  The American beer selection is mediocre and the Asian predictable.  I think they should add craft beers, in particular an IPA.

However, I would definitely recommend Flamingo Palace.  Very good value and good food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service. I've been coming here for about 7 years, both dine in and take out, and have never been dissapointed. Everyone I take here (chinese friends included) are impressed with how good it is. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"From our experience tonight, this restaurant is between 3 and 4 stars. The food was good. My husband loved his Shrimp Fried Rice and my General Tso's chicken was different, but good. BTW, do not be fooled by the \"redness\" of the General Tso's chicken, it is not hot. 

The service was great. They were very kind and helpful. 

The ambiance of the restaurant was very quiet, too quiet. I could hear a man from a table across the way jabbing his fork into his plate and smacking his food. I was not too keen on the quietness. 

My husband and I would definitely eat here again and probably will. I just would not go out of my way for this particular restaurant.

Again, great service and good food! :)"}
{"text":"A (pink) little gem!

We found this place on Yelp and decided to try it out based on the reviews. We have been back 4 times since! When we are in the mood to go and sit and relax and enjoy a nice Chinese meal - this is where we go. 

The place is definitely dated, but it has it's charm. Its \"Flamingo Palace\", so of course it has to be pink. And it definitely is. It takes me back to various Chinese Restaurants we frequented as a kid in the 80's, so there's some comfy nostalgia to go with your Chinese comfort food. 

Every time we go, we are greeted and seated promptly and by the same two people, a young hostess/busser and then a woman whom we believe to be the owner. Overhearing some other restaurant patrons, \"she is always here\". 

Though the place does seem a bit dated and not much effort has been put into updates, you can tell everyone takes pride in their service and the food. We always order the potstickers, and she always politely reminds us that they are cooked to order and will take 15 minutes. We don't care, they are delicious and Zach will often keep the dipping sauce to use on the rest of his meal - it's that good. 

We also always order the Flamingo Palace Special Chicken - it's also just that good. Then we get a variety of other things based on mood. We have really never been disappointed with what we have ordered, but we don't branch out that much here either. I wouldn't say this place is all that different in preparation of the common dishes, not to call it 'basic', but it definitely ranks higher in the quality and freshness category in comparison to many of their competitors here in the Valley that serve stale, old, soggy food. 

(One tid-bit of constructive crticism - the dining room could use a regualr dusting and maybe even a spot-painting of the walls. It's not nasty, but I could see how many could be really put off on returning.)

We appreciate you Flamingo Palace!"}
{"text":"First, this place has been around forever! That means it must be a good successful family owned place! Usual asian foods. I really like thier hunan beef, sometimes i do chicken instead. I give it 4 stars, because like other reviews, some of the items are bland, you just gotta know what to order!"}
{"text":"A buddy from work recommended this place, and I was skeptical, only because I am a \"snob\" when it comes to Chinese food... I am VERY picky.  The atmosphere is a bid old school, in a good way.  The waitresses have been extremely friendly every time I have been.

Now lets talk food...

I went with several buddies, so we decided to get several dishes and just slip them between us.  Their Flamingo Special Chicken is out of control good!  It's lightly breaded in a light sauce that has a hint of ginger and includes green onions... fantastic!  The Moo Goo Gai Pan is also great, awesome flavor.  The Sauteed Spicy Shrimp is absolutely delicious!!!  It's a red sauce, with kind of a vinegar and tomato flavor (not the best description, but trust me), and goes great on rice.  Finally the General Tso's Chicken is the best that I have had in Phoenix.

The prices are very reasonable as well.  Usually $7-10 for a dinner portion that could feed 2 small eaters, or one of me.

The bottom line is... bring some friends and go try it, I think you will be pleased!"}
{"text":"Egg drop soup was great... Fast delivery... Friendly service..."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good but service is less than good our waitress was very slow to come greet and take order she never came back till we had to wave her down to get our check part of our order was messed up we told her we never was able to even let her know since she never came back to table  .She told us she had a party to take care of and her uncle was supposed to see to us. That let us know where she felt about us . We would of had really bad experience if the bus girl had not been there She kept our beverages full."}
{"text":"Food is very good, lunch specials affordable, and you can get an extra soup instead of the eggroll, which I prefer."}
{"text":"I ordered from them using the Grubhub App. I got a confirmation from GrubHub that my order was received and my meal would be there within the hour. 3 hours later, no delivery. I called the location and they told me no order. Didn't ask if I would like to make one, just nope not here. I called Grubhub and they refunded my money and gave me a discount for a future meal. I was not happy with the restaurant's response. I understand that it wasn't their fault, but they didn't even bother to ask if I wanted to order something, nor did they apologize. They were very rude on the phone. Sad, because I liked their food."}
{"text":"Love the lunches especially. House special chicken, first thing in the menu, is my favorite, a real meal."}
{"text":"My husband I moved into this area a little over a year ago.  Though there are plenty of restaurants (both fast food and sit down) in this neighborhood, we were hoping to find a good Chinese restaurant.  It took us almost an entire year to finally try out Flamingo Palace.  The first time we went was probably 2 months ago - since then, we've been back at least 6 times. 

The flamingo chicken (their speciality) is out of this world.  The crispiness of the chicken and the sauce that is used blend so well together.  I can't go to the restaurant without ordering this dish.  We've also tried their chow fun, seafood soup, sizzling rice soup, mongolian beef, walnut shrimp, house fried rice, crab puffs, wonton soup, and I can't think of the others - we haven't left disappointed with one dish just yet.  

Though this Chinese restaurant charges more than your most ma/pa restaurants, it's still a pretty good deal considering how good the food is.

Service is not bad at all.  They all are Chinese therefore have a very thick accent, but it's still understandable.  They are prompt and check on you often.  I am definitely a fan of this place!"}
