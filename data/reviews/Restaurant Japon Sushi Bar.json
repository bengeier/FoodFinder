{"text":"The food was good; interesting and tasty flavours but the reason I will never be going back is that the services was horrible. I went with 2 other friends and we had a coupon from groupon. I don't know if it was because we had a coupon but the waitress was seriously rude, slow and very condescending. We still ended up paying extra because we ordered wine ect but the service was just disgusting. Never going back."}
{"text":"Beware !!! The city fined this restaurant multiple times because it is infested with cockroaches !!! look it up. The owners were aware of it and did nothing. they should be ashamed !!"}
{"text":"Restaurant favori de toute notre famille que ce soit pour de bons sushis ou un excellent teryaki et que dire des délicieux desserts glacés : nous sommes tous conquis !  Bravo à toute l'équipe de Mr Wong qui s'applique jour après jour à nous offrir un service impeccable !"}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open for a few years now and is basically the only sushi restaurant in Ville St-Laurent.  Authenticity - Vietnamise owned, and has some fusion style sushi has well has vietnamese roll style sushi that are pretty cool. However the non sushi plates won't look or taste like a japanese owner would do it. Decor - Great looking place. Service - Service is fine and at the appropriate speed Menu - Good variety Price - A bit overpriced  So why am I just giving it one star?  Freshness - I've been a few times, and I was never impressed. However my last experience was unforgivable. The sashimi salmon was okay, but the tuna wasn't fresh, and the Eel was disgusting and clearly shouldn't of been served.   I can't forgive a sushi restaurant that serves sashimi that isn't fresh."}
{"text":"The sushi was mediocre, borderline not fresh.  The maki rolls had some tempura something it it and it was rubbery and tasted the oil.   Really?  chewy maki rolls? Scary! The special roll came with a special mayo on top, as often the case, but had no flavor.  You may think that my taste buds were off somehow, but my wife thought it was just as bad. Can't be a coincidence...  The lunch sushi special was $16 for 9 pieces.  I figured the pieces had to be really special and tasty for that price.  Was I ever wrong.  Soup was lukewarm and service unimpressive.    I give 1 star for the food and another star for the decor, about the only thing I liked at this place.  And that generous!  So, not going back.  Sushi shop is 5 stars compared to this place"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Japon with my family on a Friday night in November.   It was quiet for a Friday night.  The decor is very nice.  The tables are rather small and narrow. Because of their design, when they put 2 tables together is doesn't make for a smooth or large enough surface to put the serving plates on.  The cheap wooden chop sticks also clash with the refined decor.  The service was sweet and all smiles. There was a significant mix up in our order however that turned out in our favor.  We ordered miso soup, Gyoza (chicken and vegetable dumplings) and shitake mushrooms for entrees.  They ranged from good (shitakes) to excellent (miso and gyoza).  We ordered teriaki rib steak and an assortment of sushis as main courses.  The rib steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection. It came with white rice and various vegetables.  The entire dish was fantastic.  We also ordered various traditional makis and sushis.  They were all excellent.  The white tuna sashimi melted in your mouth and had a buttery texture. The tuna and salmon on the sushi was not of the best quality but it was still very good.    The kitchen was excruciatingly slow however.  The entrees came after about 25 min. (which is not too bad) but we had to wait another 40 or 50 min. for the sushi and steak to come after we finished our entrees.  When they finally did, there was only half of the sushi order. They brought a second platter about 15 min. later but it was the wrong order.  They finally brought  the right one about 5 min. later. That's when we got  the 9 pieces of sashimi we had not ordered.  We told the waitress. She checked our order, realized we had not ordered them and offered them free of charge :)).  That made up for the slow service.  All and all it was a good experience.  I would recommend this place and go back again."}
{"text":"Would not return. Extremely slow service, and treats you differently if you have a discount voucher. Avoid unless you are willing to go without a groupon or livingsocial voucher."}
{"text":"The sushi is way overrated for this price. I do not understand why so many people are crazy about this restaurant.   Firstly, the rice used to roll sushi is terrible (for this price range, the rice is NOT acceptable), imagine a sushi that is a bit chewy.....   Secondly, just because the salmon, tuna, avocado, tempura, cream cheese, etc. are good in sushi, it doesn't mean you can randomly pick any ingredient and stuff them into a rice roll: sushi uses every ingredient's original taste to make great combinations. Japon has successfully made each piece of sushi an unforgettable disaster.   Thirdly, COOKED GREEN ONION IN SUSHI, REALLY? I ordered Geisha, the chef uses COOKED, yes, COOKED tuna, and put a small piece of cooked green onion in middle. When is the last time you found out a piece of cooked green onion in your sushi? The cooked tuna tastes canned.   Moreover, can you at least use fresh fish? i know it is hard, but the yellow tale tuna tastes like it aged for a year, please, it is not steak.   The service is just fine, just fine. The decoration shows the poor taste of the owner.  If you just want sushi, try sushi buffet such as sushi st-jean; if you want to eat really good sushi with similar price, try the following restaurant and you will never come back here: Atami, 5 Saison, Zentos, Soba."}
{"text":"I wonder how many of us remember the golden days of Soto in Montréal.  Before it opened a chain of catering business (which ultimately led to its demise), Soto on St-Laurent was the forefront of avantgarde sushi in Montreal.  It's been already ten years since then, the former chef from Soto is back here with revenge--- even more equipped with his ever so imaginative array of repertoire.  Better yet, the former kitchen chef from Sakura has also teamed up with him at Japon possibly to make this Ville St-Laurent restaurant the best Japanese eatery  in the city.    Their dishes (we had omakase for three) which included everything from kobe beef sushi to succulent ama-ebi shrimp nigiri, from mango sprinkled spicy tuna to the traditional codfish saikyo-yaki, are at least as imaginative and mind-boggling as Nobu in NYC or Sushi Ran in the Bay Area.  Japon certainly lives up to its name---fiercely modern take on contemporary Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"First off , I have to say that the decoration of this place is more than just  nice. Once you enter the restaurant, the fragrance of planted flowers breeze across your nose. The look is based on a chic oriental decor, the contrast of the place was mostly red  covered .   Second off, we had   the chance to observe the preparation of our dish that kept us involved during the process.  The seats and tables were comfortable and every corner was welcoming and kept privacy. You have a choice to sit at the bar situated on the mezzanine or the main floor at wood  tables upholstered with red material benches. In their  menu , you have a variety of delicious Japanese dishes  presented in two parts. The first part is the menu with the different sushi they make and the second part is the main dishes menu. I enjoyed the principal chef specialities like Spicy Oba made of fresh tuna tartar wrapped in a spicy mayonnaise and caviar, presented on a Oba tempura leaf. The average price range is between 25-35$. Overall, I recommend this place for special occasions like dates, business meetings, a couple anniversary or not more than 2 people rendezvous."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars, and came for our Valentine's meal. I ordered a bottle of Saki which infact came in 3 carafins. ( never saw the bottle) We were unable to finish and one bottle was completely untouched. We asked if we could return one car agin and have a desert instead( one which we were to share) The manger came over and said.. Absolutely not, we ordered a bottle .. This is what it is.. We ordered a desert anyways. We were insulted.. And the manager was very arrogant. What a horrible way to end our Valentine's dinner!"}
{"text":"Great sushi and service, but some might consider it to be a little pricy. I really loved their tempura appetizer, it was hot and crunchy when it got to the table. Yum! The sushi is fresh and their plates are always beautifully presented."}
{"text":"Bought a daily deal coupon thing for this place and enjoyed my dinner very much.  Staff were friendly and accommodating and happy to accept my coupon deal and didn't treat me like a second class customer. Menu options were explained, questions about cocktail selections were answered and food was delivered promptly. Sushi was very good and tasted fresh.  Rolls were creative and overall were a good price/quality ratio while the warm sake really hit the spot.  I will be happy to return with or without a coupon in the future"}
{"text":"Very bad experience.  Waited an hour and a half for our first course. We were using a group on and were definitely treated as if we weren't a full paying customer. We were served last after the entire restaurant. Not really our waitress fault but management. When we brought up the long wait issue to the manager we were told \"its saturday night, we are busy and you guys are using a groupon\"  THEN SELL USING GROUPON!!  Took us a solid 3.5 hrs to finish the meal. We were trying  to manage our wine to enjoy with the food. But its hard when you sit around that long. We asked for a complimentary bottle to hold us over. They gave us 1 glass of wine and told us to share for 6 adults. What a joke.   The one thing we did get out of this restaurant, is that we wont ever be going back. They accomplished this task and didnt seem to care about proper customer service.  Unfortunately the food is pretty good, but by no means worth the long wait times. We were hit with a groupon forced 15% tip... thats right . We were forced to tip the horrible service. We all felt completely scammed.  My review is a harsh one because i hope places that treat customers like this restuarnt did close down. People dont deserve to be ripped off forcefully.  Hope this review helps you avoid making a reservation at this establishment."}
{"text":"Went there for supper for valentine and the food was really great.  Had some good sake with it. The decor of the restaurant looks great, with a lot of red which is to be expected. The sushi tasted fresh. The Wasabi was good, not too strong. Yes it's not a cheap place but the food is good and the sushi are well done. To add to the food, the service was friendly."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, though not the best I've ever had. I really did enjoy the special sushi rolls, though they were pretty pricey. The place looks nice and the service was good. I would say that this restaurant is a modernization of the traditional sushi restaurant  (hope that makes sense). I would go back again, if I had a Groupon that is."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for two at 7:00pm, got to the restaurant and our table was not ready... They told us the people before were still eating!! We finally got our table at 7:15, our waiter came to our table not before 7:45-8:00 to get our order. I ordered a drink and I had to remind her after half an hour about my drink. Got our appetizer by 8:45, the waiter made a mistake in our order! By 9:00 (2 hours after we got here) we finally got our sushis. The Wasabi & Ginger next to our sushi had changed their colors, soooo dry that we couldnt seperate the layer of ginger... Sushi was ok, you can get the same sushi or even better ones at any \"Sushi Shop\" or \"Sushi man\" take out place. I rate them 1, because they have potential... Its a nice place but food and service Not so great."}
{"text":"Had one of my worst service ever, rude stuff not welcoming. Food was good. We really enjoyed what we had . However the bad service and inexperience stuff will make you forget about the food.  There weren't anything extra special about the sushi we had that makes you ignore the service and want ti come back. I gave 2 stars just for the food ."}
{"text":"One of the best secrets of the city. Located in ville st Laurent you wouldn't think it's the gem it is. Always fresh. Great selection if you are with a non sushi lover. Service is decent and prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"D'ont ever GO There...condamned a lots of times for insalubrity and cockroaches in the kitchen!!!!"}
