{"text":"Went here twice for breakfast while staying in Montréal for a couple of nights. It's across from a McDonald's but Café Lulu is definitely the better place to have breakfast! It's not a big place but they deliver great service! They have a big menu board with breakfast plates with eggs, fruit and toast, make omelettes on the spot, right in front of you. The coffee is great also. Free fruity water as well."}
{"text":"Très bon accueil. Souriant et sympathique. Petit déjeuner correct. J'ai adoré le toast avocat et uf.!les muffins ont l'air bons. Je reviendra les goûter."}
{"text":"Nous avons manger une assiette au saumon, le met du jour.  C'était bien apprêtée, délicieux  Bien situé près du métro  Nous le recommandons à tous"}
{"text":"Had breakfast plate and loved it, also had breakfast sandwich, it was excellent.  It's cooked to order so, be patient and you will be glad you did.  Best coffee i have had in the city. I will definitely return.  Has outside seating as well. Nice in good weather."}
{"text":"almond chocolate croissant was amazing. So was the regular croissant. The coffee was fresh and delicious, and the omelettes made on the crepe slab were all amazing as well. Be aware that this will not be a quick breakfast if you have a group as each item is hand made by the one guy there with care. We thought it was worth it. All the ingredients were fresh and none of us had a complaint in the world."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp and it's ability to filter restaurants by proximity we were able to find this spot very near to where we were staying for the weekend!  It's located right across from a McDonald's and is situated at the corner of the street. My friend and I ordered the #4 which was a sandwich with egg, ham, tomato, lettuce and mayo on toasted white bread. The sandwich was tasty but a little overpriced at $6.95.  Our cashier was very patient with all the questions we asked and was prompt with her service.   As far as the menu goes there is quite a selection but not much can be modified. Meaning there is only white bread for the sandwiches and one type of bagel, etc. We also ordered tea  she brought us a box of teabags to choose which tea and filled up a mini kettle of hot water. I tried the maple tea which was really yummy."}
{"text":"This was our favourite little age close to our hotel. You are welcomed by a warm atmosphere and the smell of scrumptious treats. The quinoa and crab cake was our favourite lunch, The crepes are all delicious at any time of the day. Strong, fresh coffee greeted us every morning."}
{"text":"It's actually a Deli food in disguise by cafeteria. But the owner is really nice, and he will customize everything for you if you have special request! The food is clean, yummy, healthy; environment is comfy and the price is decent. Overall, I'll give this visit a 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. Nice little cafe with more than a few breakfast options and this was a one women show. Do not go here in a hurry. She took our orders, made our amazing coffee and cooked our delicious food, so yes it took little long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend on a guys trip with some college buddies and stopped in here early while my friends were sleeping off their buzz from the all nighter. Came in, and felt very welcomed by the polite staff working. I ordered the breakfast special and wad suprised at how delicious it was! Great atmosphere, and really good music playing. Free wifi too, which is great for a traveler like me! Go check them out, they are awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but crepes were a bit rubbery.  Nutella and banana had good taste and maple syrup was good.  Eggs with vegetables was good too served with brown toast.  Good quick bite, not amazing."}
{"text":"16$ pour un déjeuner (2 ufs, 2 saucisses, pain, patates OU fruits et un jus d'orange maison) c'est trop cher pour ce qui est offert. Les oeufs étaient très légers mais depuis les rénovations les prix ont flambés alors que la qualité est la même. Le service est toujours extrêmement courtois et enjoué."}
{"text":"Came here on our departure morning from Montreal.  What a bad idea!  I don't know what they are using the sanitize this place - but all three of us spent the long 8 hour drive back home with stomach cramps and stopping at multiple rest stops.    Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch / breakfast while visiting Montreal. The service was amazing! They were real kind and spoke French to my friend who was trying to learn. They also brought us water and were just generally very nice. Sandwiches were also delicious and I recommend the almond croissant. Prices were also pretty reasonable. Was delicious and perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"Stopped here right after getting into Montréal. Great service- both people behind the counter were incredibly kind and helpful, and gave us advice on where to go.   Food was great too, friends and I ordered avocado toast with eggs which was good, and the latte was great also."}
{"text":"Definitely recommended- you should try their salads. Price is very reasonable for portion size. Free super fast wifi and lemon water thumbs up.  Very delicious and fresh food. Inside is spacious, bathrooms are clean and staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Great coffee excellent, friendly service. First visit to Montreal and stumbled upon this cute cafe for breakfast. Food was good and the owner was very friendly asking where I was from. Gave my friend and I maps and entertainment guides. Was very helpful and went out of his way."}
{"text":"I love this place! Food is fast and delicious, very affordable and tasty! Both the people working when we went were really friendly and helpful, definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Best little spot in the village for breakfast, lunch, and coffee. Everything is homemade, the prices are terrific, and the owner, who also waits on tables and does the cooking, is super nice. A must try if you are visiting Montreal!"}
{"text":"Glad that they have lemonade home made, orage juice home made and yagourt home made !, much space inside and terrasse available. Baklava and croissants available but not the best.. Also some paninis."}
