{"text":"What Montreal Pool Room lacks in actual pool tables, it makes up for with tasty poutine.   A couple friends and I shared 2 large poutines. We eyeballed the monstrous dishes and wondered if we could possibly finish it all. None of us were really hungry, but we were there on a mission. If you live outside of Quebec, it is not acceptable to visit the province without indulging in a proper poutine. There must be a by-law written about it somewhere...   Gravy flowed over the styrofoam containers as we made a silent agreement that not one curd would go to waste. We ordered a couple sodas to wash down our feast - Cott's Black Cherry and Spruce beer. You can't get more Canadian than that.  The room is essentially a dingy-looking diner and the service is not exactly top-notch, but we didn't go for the ambiance - We went to chow down. And chow down we did...  First up was the chicken poutine. The gravy was piping hot with a rich flavour and thick, but even consistency. There wasn't a lot of chicken, so my friends and I became poutine pirates, trying to find the treasure lost in a sea of gravy. The chicken chunks were grilled, lightly seasoned with herbs and very tender - A great match for the classic fries and fresh, squeaky cheese curds.   The meat poutine is smothered in a rich tomato and ground beef sauce. It's a bizarre fusion of a Quebecois classic with the Italian sauce your neighbour's mamma used to make. They mix a bit of ordinary gravy in as well, which gives the meat sauce a thinner consistency than expected. There is unfortunately very little going on in the way of seasoning - a bit of extra basil and oregano would've lent itself well to this dish. The cheese curds were drowning in meat sauce, but amazingly, they kept their shape and squeakiness.   Overall, the chicken poutine is a winner; the Italian version needs some refinement.   We left with a sense of accomplishment - Our mission was a success! Totally worth the residual shame and instant weight-gain..."}
{"text":"If you like hookers and drug dealership your late night poutine and frankfurters then this place will be heaven for you!  Add to that the surly Russian mobsters in the witness protection program who work behind the counter and it's an all around great time!  The poutine was, in fact really, really good, as were the franks and corn-dogs which we impulse bought on the way out the door.  If you're in the area trolling for a hummer or buying weed, then stop in!"}
{"text":"I was in Montreal on business and checked in at the hotel late. I went for a walk and found this place. I had not been to Montreal before and wanted to try some traditional Poutine. I really enjoyed my first Montreal Steamed Hot Dog and Poutine and what better place to have it than the Montreal Pool Room."}
{"text":"Definitely hits the spot when you've got a classic poutine craving. Make sure to bring cash!! Only reason I'm bringing a star down is because it's cash only."}
{"text":"Steamed hot dogs (wild pause) sound pretty gross but they were actually good.  The poutine was on point, then again it was 2:30 AM so my judgement could be off. Saw some wack hookers hanging outside."}
{"text":"I visited the Montreal Pool Room to try one thing on their menu - the poutine. Looking back on it, I think I regret not getting the steamé in a combo since the small poutine isn't as hefty a portion as I expected. It's by no means underwhelming, but certainly could be bigger. As for the taste, it was fairly standard. The cheese curds were fantastic (10/10) but the gravy seemed a little on the cold side and not the most fresh or flavorful. The fries were good and met my expectations. Overall, it was a decent experience and I got what I expected from the establishment - a spud poutine!"}
{"text":"Cash only! Not fancy, not dirty.  We went as a family of 4. It's pretty much walk-in, pay, and sit with your food. We ordered a poutine and an onion ring which we shared between the 4 of us (the baby is 11 months, so she mostly just chewed on fries).  Because our hotel was just a minute away (the Zero 1, on the corner of St Laurent and Rene-Levesque), I couldn't tell you about parking. But for walking distance, it's great! It's true what others say. This is located seconds away from strip clubs. But across the street there is another restaurant (deer garden) and not to far away is the Rolopan that we went to for our dessert. The location is fantastic if you want to walk around downtown.  I don't really have much to say. I thought the food-value was quite good. We purchased pop cans at 1.55 each. Essentially, one person can eat here quite well for under 15$. That was the price we paid for everything that night. I could not have finished the onion rings and fries on my own. I actually quite liked the onion rings, they were crispy. Even my three year old liked cracking them open and slurping out the onions.  Hubby liked it so much he wanted to go back for more. Because of how quick and informal this place is, we will surely return."}
{"text":"Top-Notch Authentic Montreal Steamies.  The Montreal Pool Room has been around for over 100 years for a reason: some of the best Montreal0-style steam hot dogs in the city.  Sure, you can get all kinds of other things here (poutine, burgers, michigans), but the real reason to drop in is for a good ol' fashion steamie. Simply put, there's nothing quite like them anywhere else."}
{"text":"What can I say, late night drunken munchies at its finest.   I took this place in over LA Belle Province at the suggestion of a friend and I was glad I did.  Grabbed a steamed hot dog (a late night Montreal staple) all dressed minus ketchup - who would want to eat that nuclear crap - to munch on for the walk back to my hotel, carting a small order of poutine. Topped with a cabbage mixture, it served its purpose, semi satisfying hunger pangs while I made my 10 minute walk.   Back in my hotel, I cracked open the poutine for some cheezy gooey goodness. The curds all melted into the fries and gravy. Just right. The secret to getting. It right is waiting IMO. Eating your poutine immediately you don't give the curds the chance to melt.   Gravy was not overly salty, fries were just right. I was definitely a happy customer.   Must visit again on my next trip to Montreal"}
{"text":"They serve great poutine and steamed dogs; can't get much more straightforward than that. Both are tasty (and filling), and you'll be glad you ventured in. This is a place I'll be visiting every time I visit Montreal!"}
{"text":"What the heck happened? Okay, this was never really gourmet food in the first place, but the hog dogs were always well prepared and the fries, soggy but aceptable. Now the fries aren't soggy anymore, they are undercooked. How disappointing. So still a good reliable for a hot dog in the wee hours and a can of black cherry, but remember to ask them to properly cook the fries!"}
{"text":"4.34 for two toasted hot dogs. well balanced slaw, crunchy onion and a good smear of yellow mustard. nothing to add, they know what they're doing"}
{"text":"Okay, so here's the deal with every city that has a soul - it always have a great hot dog variation.  DC has its half-smokes.  New York is eternally Sabretts versus Hebrew National, griddled versus sewer water style.  Chicago has their Vienna beef on a steamed poppy seed bun and dragged through the garden.  Buffalo has its Sahlens grilled up.  Detroit has their coneys, and Cincinnati has their cheese coneys.  Toronto has comically large bland weenies to complement their image.  And Montreal....?  Before the casse croutes made their poutines, before the Jews bought forth the smoked meats and the bagels, and before the Montreal melon became extinct, there were Montreal hot dogs.  There's the LaFleur versus the Lester's, and the steamies versus the toasties (and to a certain extent, a Michigan dog).  So, what makes each special?  First, the dominant steamies - the buns and the dogs are steam cooked, and they come all-dressed -  mustard, chopped onions and coleslaw (not the mayonnaise one - the vinegary/lemony type).  Then there's the toasties, which are dog and bun griddled.  Michigan is similar to a Detroit coney - steamed, meat chili sauce on top, mustard, onions optional, no cabbage, ever.    Okay, now that we get the hot dog culture out of the way, it's time to ask the $64,000 question - why have it at the Montreal Pool Room?  For one, it's open from 10a to past 2a at the Quartiers de spectacles.  Chinatown restaurants usually open fairly late, as does the La Belle Province or the Boustan down the block, but then those restaurants are found all over Montreal, and there's only one pool room. You also don't get that sense of shadiness that you do with the pool room.  For two, check out the surroundings - during Habs games you will no doubt hear the broadcast on the PA in French, and when the announcer screams \" Une Goal, c'est la premiere goal pour Pacioretty ce soir\" the place erupts in collective approval, driven by the Habs paraphernalia surrounding the dining room.  If you are a Habs fan it's like being on the fifth line in mini Bell Centre.  For three, it's one of those places where you rub elbows with Montreal's various layers of humanity.  Maybe it's the Advocat who just got out of the palais de justice, or the civil servant who spent the afternoon at Complex Guy Favreau.  Or perhaps it's the perv who got out of the Cleopatra cafe, or a post-punk who were over at the Army/Navy store on St. Laurent down the block.  You can be a prince, a pauper, a tycoon or a tike.  All of them eat their steamies the same way.    I consider the Steamies at the pool room to be the metric used to evaluate others throughout the city.  Are the buns as soft and warm as the Pool Room?  Are their Lester's as juicy?  How about the slaw?  Is it a fresh crisp refreshing counterpoint?  How about their onion ratio?  The pool room has 105 years to get their hot dogs right, so what can I say?  Practice makes perfect.  And finally, when you order those Steamies, don't forget to order a poutine to go with it.  Remember that a poutine should realize its namesake - a fucking mess.  You should see copious amounts of fresh fries, gravy and fresh squeaky cheese curds - they should make you feel like you just got a lap dance at a full contact club, that is, dirty, unhealthy and oh so nice.  You should have the culinary equivalent of sweaty-all-over-and-face-glazed-like-a-donut.  The poutines at the pool room should do exactly that.  If it doesn't, you showed up at the wrong hot dog joint."}
{"text":"First place I tried poutine at since landing in Montreal. Gravy doesn't taste strong enough for my liking, and the consistency of the cheese curds seem to vary. Had slightly hard bits on my first visit and chewy ones on the second.   Burgers taste pretty decent though. Wouldn't go just to eat either mains or poutine, but wouldn't mind stopping in for a late-night snack either."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs. Awsome poutine. Quick and friendly service. Convenient location. We had two steamies dressed up, with poutine and a classic black cherry cola. Everything tastes as good as it looks. They helped me in English. Which is great because my French is atrocious."}
{"text":"I'm not Canadian, but I'm from Buffalo whish is as close to Canada as you can get to Canada with out actually being in Canada. With that being said, I am no stranger to poutine. The poutine here was not good. My hotel was close and this place was open late. We were hungry so we took a walk over and got some food to go.  The inside is old and boring but, that's to be expected from a late night food joint. The place was pretty clean though, cleaner then most. We each had a combo, burger, poutine, pop (soda for you Canadians). They were pretty fast but not the friendliest  again to be expected. it was 2:30 in the am.  One we got back the room it was time to indulge. What a disappointment. wasn't poutine invented in Montreal? It was not good. Mushy and flavorless. The burger was burnt and crispy. The plus was, they were open so late, but chances are I will not come back. Maybe I was not drunk enough."}
{"text":"What a dive! Had to stop in here for a late-night snack. Poutine had delicious curds but the fries could've been crisper. Had some steamies all-dressed (this may be the birthplace of the dish!), bun melted in my mouth, enjoyed the topping combo but found the slaw a bit too sugary. Cheap, fast, open late and worth the stop for the historical factor alone."}
{"text":"Are you looking for Mecca de la curds   Look no further Montreal times are changing but some things have decided to stay the same. What joy but to find poutine is like an old friend that when months or years are spent apart, when you come together it's like no time has passed conversation flows as easy as gravy. See what I did there? Service is always impecable however I am a firm believer that you get out what you put in servers are people too I would know i used to be one for more than half of my adult life. Those days are gone but life spears my heart to say not much has changed. A smile brings a smile no? Well ce la vie curds for everyone"}
{"text":"We got all dressed hot dogs as recommended by our local friend and they were good. Cheap but quite small. We actually ate prior to stopping by but otherwise it wouldn't have been very filling. I am a huge fan of Chicago hot dogs, with sweet relish and the poppy seed bun, so these tasted quite plain in comparison. I would recommend this for a quick, cheap bite but wouldn't go out of my way to try it."}
{"text":"Experience the real life of Montreal! A seedy location, surrounded by everything not good in life and the food is not really good for you too but ohhh the taste... ohhh sooo good, simply the best in the world. I'm the third generation in my family to eat here and I am proud to carry on the tradition.  Ask for two steamies all dressed and a bottle of spruce beer, a small fries and sit back and enjoy! Plenty of famous people and politicians have eaten here over the century including the Village People in their hay day. It is not a trip to Montreal without a stop here at least once.  Be careful, you may become addicted."}
{"text":"Steam hot dogs and yummy fries...... Heaven. Always stop by when I return to Montreal. You must try a true Montreal steamed hot dog - all dressed a must. Nothing comes close in the rest of Canada. Warning - it's located around strip clubs / sex shops but who cares. You will smell the hot dogs as soon as you walk around the corner.  I'm amazed that I cant get a hot dog as good in Toronto or Vancouver."}
{"text":"This is just what you need: affordable and simple food, tasty and local. Much better than big chain fast food. Great service too!  Support Small & Local Business!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for a snack.   This place has been open since 1912. They moved locations in 2010 across the street to allow for new developments. The Montreal Pool Room is known for being the first place to create the \"steamie\" in Montreal. (a steamed hotdog that is very popular here in MTL)  I would go everyday as the food is so great and the area is known for bring in some interesting people as it is in the heart of the red light district.   Highly recommend for anyone in the city who loves stemies' and poutine"}
{"text":"Definitely not a disappointment!! Poutine was great and the atmosphere was just the way I like it. Nice, but not too nice!! I will definitely make it back here!!!"}
{"text":"This is the first place I had poutine in Montreal. It is located in what I am told the former Red Light district, you can tell this because there is a \"Go-Go\" club across the street and a seedy/divey bars up and down the strip. It you are looking for a fancy establishment i would suggest going a couple blocks away close to the mall area. The venue is THE BEST people watching I have had in a while, I couldn't understand the french but that added to the awesomeness. I literally would just imagine the dialog, entertainment for hours.   The food was greasy and good, just what I expected from a place like this. I haven't had alot of poutine so i cant really tell you how it was from a quality perspective but I liked it. This place takes cash only so remember to bring your loonies ;) Food came out fast and piping hot. All and all I love going to places like this when I travel because I get to see some of the local culture. There was a festival going on at the time so there was alot of people out and about but this place was relatively empty with in-and-out traffic. I feel like a found a little gem for downtown Montreal and cant wait to see what else this city has to offer."}
{"text":"Accueil très très froid ! Poutine peu copieuse et pas terrible. L'hygiène est aussi à revoir..."}
{"text":"Un classique à Montréal. Le décor laisse à désirer mais on n'an pas envie qiu'il change. C'est la place à Montréal pour les meilleurs hot-dogs.  On chuchote qu'Al Capone y allait souvent, et franchement, on le comprend"}
{"text":"Simple and tasty food is how I would describe this place. The staff were lovely and prepared the food for us fast.   A friend and I split one of their combos ($9.95)  that come with two hotdogs (with all the fixings - sauerkraut, onions, relish and mustard) a poutine and a drink.  The hot dogs are small so if you have a bigger appetite - order a few more. The hot dog was great - simple and satisfying. The poutine was good as well. TBH I'm not a poutine person so a good from me is great!   There was some tables of four in this area and bar seating styles.  This place is also cash only.  I would recommend this place for those who want good food and a good price!"}
{"text":"Montreal Pool Room is an institution. It's been around forever, or least it looks like it. And just as the place looks like it has been suspended in time, so has the food.   The poutine. Refrigerated curds, a shocker to me considering how much they must go through in a day. Fries majorly uncooked, resulting in a very starchy taste. Gravy, just your traditional powdered stuff you can buy at the supermarket.  Don't get me wrong. I like institutions. I like basic simple poutines. I enjoyed looking at the pictures that document our decades in Montreal, and I also enjoyed eavesdropping to the local patrons complaining about taxes and discussing the personal life rumours of Habs players.   But even when it comes to Montreal diners, there's much better... so that there's no reason for me to ever go back."}
{"text":"Finally crossed off this institution on my TDL. The all-dressed steamie from here is the main pic on the \"Montreal hot dog\" Wikipedia article and it definitely doesn't disappoint. First off, the chopped cabbage is not at all salty, balancing the savory wiener and mustard. All-dressed from other places always came off as \"too much\" but this one is quite the thing. Then the bun was perfectly steamed, slightly sweet, which made the whole thing such a joy to eat (puffed up bun on the outside, soft wiener on the inside, and chopped cabbage to add some additional texture). This might be the best hot dog I ever had. I personally prefer this one over Décarie hot dog.  The vibe is authentic and retro. Lots of locals from the old era talking politics and other AM channel topics over hot dogs, fries, and ketchup pooled over napkins.  Historically signifiant and still relevant."}
{"text":"Popped in to this spot for poutine on a weekend trip to Montreal. YUM. That's all. no frills hot dog spot with delicious and piping hot poutine ready to serve. don't miss out."}
{"text":"Un classique qui existe depuis 1912. Hot dog, burgers, frites, etc... pour pas cher!"}
{"text":"When it was recommended to me that some of the best poutine in town is at the Montreal Pool Room I immediately imagined and thought: \"Oh great. So I need to suffer through a dingy, smoky and dimly lit pool joint just to find great poutine?\" I kind of brushed that recommendation off and started to seek out another alternative. But on the way back to our hotel at around 11pm we both were pining for some quick food and Montreal Pool Room beckoned on our way with bright lights and a neon \"OUVERT\" sign. I was shocked to discover it wasn't even a pool room at all but your basic counter-service burger/fries/poutine joint!  YAY! We did not come away disappointed. Burgers were fantastic and perfectly cooked, poutine was the absolute best we'd ever had. Service was fairly quick and efficient but without much friendliness (pretty much what you'd expect from a late-night quick bite burger joint) It has plenty of indoor seating but we took our items to go. They have plenty of combo choices that mix in burgers or hot dogs with regular fries or with poutine. Easy ordering and fairly decent prices. If you have a late night hankering, be sure to check them out!"}
{"text":"This was, quite possibly, the most (stereotypically) Canandian thing I have ever done in my life. It had to be done. It was beautiful. It called out to be done, and I was powerless to the siren's song.  That song, of course, is the sound of a steamé and a big plate of poutine. For the uninitiated (as I was) a steamé (pronounced steam-ee) is what it sounds like: a steamed food. Specifically, a steamed hot dog. For more learning on the subject, Wikipedia has a fascinating entry about the Montreal Hot Dog, which actually mentions this restaurant by name. The long and short of it is that they're steamed, typically pretty small, and pretty inexpensive. And also awesome. Get it all-dressed (mustard, onion, and finely chopped cabbage slaw) or you can opt for one of several other toppings with sauce. I seem to recall an Italian style with a tomato sauce, or Michigan-style, with a meat sauce.  The other siren's song that called even more strongly, was of course, poutine. Oh, poutine. you delightful Canadian delicacy. This wasn't fancy stuff, this wasn't artisan, this was good ol' fashioned late night poutine that hits the spot. Hits. The. Spot. It was well after midnight, and I had just come from and amazing Halloween party, and this was precisely what I wanted. Fries. Cheese. Gravy. Satisfaction.  There are a few other options. Get your hot dog toasted, order a burger, grab some regular fries. Or bundle things in a combo. It's not fancy inside, and what the fellas running the place lacked in overt friendliness, they made up for in proficiency. You get your food quick. Be aware that it's cash only, which makes for an even more Canadian experience, as you can walk in, order a steamé, toss the dude a toonie, and satisfy your belly (drunk or not) with a uniquely Montreal food."}
{"text":"Their hotdogs are more like weiners, also they are steamed instead of grilled, which I guess is what they are known for. Although tiny, it's not bad for the cheap price. What is standout though, are actually their poutines, soooo good. Curds, gravy, potato. All amazing.  A good staple restaurant thats been around for more than a century and is also open late!  Would recommend bringing cash as they dont take card but do have ATMs on site."}
{"text":"Montreal Pool Room is a landmark in the heart of what used to be the city's Red Light District. It retains some the rough and gritty atmosphere of its neighbourhood. Don't let yourself be intimidated by its surroundings and walk-in to grab delicious and cheap hot dogs in a snack bar that appears to be stilted in time. This is the perfect place for late night greasy food cravings."}
{"text":"I'd never had poutine before, so I wanted to try it for my last night in Montreal. My wife and I split combo #4, which was two steamés, fully loaded, poutine, and a can of soda. Altogether, it was probably $12.  I thought the poutine was great, though I have nothing else to compare it to. I didn't find the hot dogs to be that good - - nothing wrong with then, but to be fair, I've never liked steamed hot dogs or slaw.  All in all, an excellent bargain for $12."}
{"text":"Came here to play some pool but decided to skip that and just eat a hot dog instead. Steamed all dressed with extra onions and relish!  This is a classy place, they only allow people dressed in black tie and gowns. Very snotty attitude like we are not good enough...I went on Halloween so maybe that's why everyone had a costume on? Nice staff. Great place for a cheap, fast, on the go, off to the whorehouse type of place!"}
{"text":"This is the type of place where you should eat poutine. Just a counter, kind of seedy and near a few strip clubs."}
{"text":"Came for the poutine, and I must say I was pretty disappointed. Yes it is decent poutine, but I wouldn't say its the best poutine that I have ever had. This place is cheap and good for a late snack, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"Great for Poutine and some montreal-style all-dressed hotdogs.  The place is apparently historical gem and it was very reminiscent of la belle province which is only across the street.  Highly recommended for their scrumptious cheese curds and consistent flavours all day long - I recommend combo #4."}
{"text":"So one quick disclaimer before you continue, Montreal style hot dogs (aka \"Steamies\") are steamed, not grilled or boiled.  Sounds gross, but trust me they aren't like those nasty New York water dogs, they are more like magic for your mouth.  As long as you are aware of this going in you're going to do just fine.  The original joint opened up in 1912 and my Dad has been going here since he came to Canada in the 1950's, so the Pool Room is pretty much my birthright.  Of course you always have La belle Pro, Valentines and La Fleurs - but none can hold a candle to the Pool Room's perfectly steamed delicacy.  Order yours \"All dressed\" - mustard, onion, relish and \"choux\"  (a coleslaw type cabbage topping) and make sure to get a poutine on the side.  Personally I like to add a dash of cayenne to my dogs and poutine, but to each their own.  Burgers are also delish, and if you aren't a fan of steamies, you can always get a \"toasty\" (a hot dog w/ a bun that resembles toasted bread) - but the steamies are the real deal Holyfield so make sure you at least try one."}
{"text":"I'm honestly not sure what all the hype is about this place. I guess it does have some character, but the food leaves something to be desired. The poutine is good, but not even close to being the best I've had. I certainly wouldn't use it as a way of introducing someone to poutine and I'm sad it was how my wife had her first poutine experience. It's what I would imagine poutine tasting like at a cafeteria. The hot dog was good, but again nothing really amazing. I was wondering why everyone seemed to be getting multiple hot dogs and it made sense once I got mine. It's tiny. If you want a simple, quick meal, then sure this place works. It won't be great unless you're drunk, but it's not bad. Would I come back though? Nope."}
{"text":"I ordered the second combo that costs about 10 dollars (including tax) which comes with a decent poutine portion, a hot dog and a beverage of your choice. I am not a poutine connoisseur but I found the flavour was decent, the hot dog wasn't special but not bad either. Overall, I enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere of the store as it is filled with history and memory of people here!"}
{"text":"After google searching the best poutine in Montreal, Montreal pool room was in the top ten and within walking distance of our hotel. So off we went.  The Montreal Pool Room is on the same street as Chinatown and looks as though this area may have been a seedy part of town at one time. Across the street from this place is an 'adult show', but don't let that scare you off from the poutine  Poutine is an artform, and the Montreal Pool Room takes this art to the highest level.  We ordered a large regular poutine and it was sight to  behold.  The fries were crispy,  the gravy was hot and the cheese cruds melty, and squeaky.   Delicious!   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Counter serve burger stop. The chefs/servers put you up with an attitude from the outstart, as if everyone was incompetent from ordering off the menu. Poutine was ATROCIOUS. Mystery watery gravy that tasted like thickened chicken broth served with thick bland fries. Cheese was of low quality. Burgers somewhere between bad and mediocre.  Slow service, and strongly accented English/French makes ordering difficult. Avoid."}
{"text":"The Montreal Pool Room is a Montreal institution. It has survived for well over a hundred years and hearkens back to an era on the Lower Main (Saint Laurent Boulevard - between Ste. Catherine Street and Rene Levesque Boulevard) when the district  was home to some of the seedier elements and establishments of  Montreal's famed red light district. Today, all that remains from that era is the Montreal Pool Room and Cleopatra's Strip Club.   The Pool Room is no longer in the location it once occupied (on the west side of Saint Laurent). It has relocated to the opposite side of the street. The pool tables that once sat in the back part of the old pool room are gone. Moreover, there used to be some good competition from other steamie joints but they have closed as well. In short, the area is being gentrified to better reflect its new designation by the city of Montreal as part of the Arts District. As a result, many of the old businesses have closed, or moved on and the area is in rapid transition.   I ordered a steamie (mustard and onions) and a French Fry with a Pepsi for $5.40. The steamie was a classic Montreal steamie probably one of the best. It was soft and had a very memorable taste. I used to eat these often years ago at the old pool room across the street. Today was the first time I had a hot dog in well over ten years. All in all, I enjoyed it very much, however, much of the character of the old pool room seems to have gone and you can expect surly service from the men who serve you.   Finally, don't be surprised with the type of clientele one finds in this establishment (everything from tourists, lawyers from the Palais de Justice, prostitutes and their clients and many regular Montrealers. Enjoy your steamies!!!"}
{"text":"Was frolicking around Place d'arts and of course we were hungry so I pulled out my handy yelp app, saw the high ratings for this establishment, and decided to take a gamble. Don't get me wrong, I love whole in the wall food, it's the best kind, but this place was just less than mediocre.  The servers were less than happy, and weren't very nice, the fries were okay, the burger was pretty simple, but slightly undercooked. We tried two different types of poutine and were less than thrilled, the quality was pretty low, and one person in our party didn't feel good after eating the food. Not sure where all these high reviews are coming in, but if I were you, I would skip this place, and keep moving, unless you are maybe drunk, high or in some other altered state.  After looking at the reviews, maybe I should have tried a Steamie, or a hot dog, maybe I just did it all wrong, but my experience was less than satisfactory.   Plus side, it was fairly cheap for 4 of us to grab some quick food on our trek around town, and the place was grimey for a classy New Yorker, but alright for a cool hipster if you follow my thoughts. Overall gripe: just didn't get a great vibe from the place, and the 4 star and 5 star reviews seem a bit excessive for this cheap fast food joint."}

{"text":"The Montreal Pool Room is known to be a famous greasy spoon in Montreal's former red-light district.  Located off os Saint Laurent Boulevard, the restaurant has been around since '12 (although a fire back in '89 burnt the building down and the restaurant was said to have been rebuilt and has since located across the street from its original post).  While you can't find any pool tables inside, you can find that their famous and popular offerings of the Steame (the steamed bun with the steamed hot dog) and the Toaste (toasted bun with the grilled hot dog).  The hubs and I came later in the evening, and we tried one of each - I preferred the Toaste, as it had a nice crisp toasted exterior, and the grilled hot dog was yummy with all the fixings.  The hubs actually preferred the Steame, as it was a simple, straight-forward dog.  Staff were friendly, and there were plenty of seats along the counter.  The restaurant itself was also clean, bright, and well-lit.  +Steame and the Toaste +friendly staff +open late"}
{"text":"Despite wiki's (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Pool_Room) claim there are no more pool tables in the Montreal Pool Room there are some in back.  The Montreal Pool Room is ground zero in Montreal's steamé hot dog culture. You can get it all dressed (covered in onions, chopped cabbage, and mustard) or au Michigan (with meat sauce). The steamé  is some cheap eats although a combo with drink and fries puts a couple dogs in the Harvey's double burger combo range. The fries beat the ass off of Harvey's, that's for sure. They're like Harvey's fries before Harvey's Inc. became real douche bags about their fries and tried to cut corners.  The joint is pretty minimal. Lots of floor space, few tables. I suspect the floor space might be there to simply handle lines for patrons who stumble in after closing hours (assuming Quebec has closing hours).  Service seems a little guarded. Probably owing to them sharing the street with some strip bars and other crèche de excitation nudity rub rubs."}
{"text":"The price is reasonable and the poutine is fine (for sure not the best you can get in Montreal). The hotdogs are yummy but perhaps not big enough to make a hungry person happy. The staff are friendly. Which makes this place especial is its location, accessible to two main streets."}
{"text":"Classic fast food joint. Fast, friendly service. We ordered poutine and burgers. Greasy, simple, no frills, as expected."}
{"text":"Great place for a late night bite. The owner was super friendly and the food was great and hit the spot. Don't expect fine dining here, but for what you get, it's awesome and great value. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Food is alright for the price, but I found the fries way too greasy to the point the were not crispy and completely unseasoned. Burger was better because of the sauce but the patty was also very plain. However the food was fresh, cooked right after we ordered. Overall not a bad place if you want to get full for under $10."}
{"text":"Delicious. We are in the middle of a visit to Montreal. I had two beers at a local pub and found myself with an insane hankering for poutine at 10:00 pm (22:00 heure). We were staying at a nearby hotel and found the Pool Room on Yelp. It took us 5 min to walk there and share the 2 steamer/ poutine/ drink combo which cost us $10.25.  The men manning the counter were polite, and I noticed the older one lovingly pouring on the gravy on the poutine. The poutine fries were toasty and perfect- they were neither over or under done. The curds were melty under the heat of the gravy, and we tore into those suckers and finished the side before even touching the dogs.   It is a rich dish for sure, so I ended up adding cayenne and salt (I know... The gravy was salty, but I am half deer), and that made them even more addictive.  The hot dogs were called steamers. They were good, but it wasn't anything over the top. The relish/ coleslaw/ onion combo was great though, and it transformed the dog.  I know this sounds weird, but if I had a choice, I would add a ridiculously huge amount of the steamer toppings to the poutine. That would be glorious, but I am not sure if this could even happen..."}
{"text":"If you're intimidated by the fact that this place is surrounded by sex shops and strip clubs, you probably aren't the kind of person thats gonna like this place.  This place is not serving up gourmet food but they easily had the best fries of my visit to Montreal so far.    The fries were shockingly crispy and very tasty. I went for the steamie (steamed hot dog) after reading about this places hot dogs on a list of 12 iconic foods from Montréal.  For a little under $6, you get a hot dog, fries, and a soda.  The hot dog was surprisingly fulfilling and I think it mostly has to do with the coleslaw type mixture (I have no idea what it actually was).  The guys working there polite in a gruff kind of way.  It's a shame this place is so close to where I'm staying because I'm sure I'll be making many more visits than I should before I leave Montréal."}
{"text":"I was told this was the place for old school basic poutine. While I have nothing to compare it to, I thought it was pretty damn good. I'm a poutine virgin no more. I will certainly try other versions."}
{"text":"One of the oldest fast food joints in the lower main. The only place for artists , workers anf somes times hickey players get there two hot dogs and fry! with a biere epinetre! A basic dirty old town space with a bit of class. one of my fav Montreal landmarks"}
{"text":"It's cheapish and quite good. I shared a toaste, steame, and small poutine with one other person. It tastes good in that unsophisticated, fast, gritty way. The poutine has a lot of gravy and the cheese curds melted more than I like them to, hence the lack of sophistication, but that's not a negative point. The toaste is slightly more expensive than the steame, but it's worth it to toast it for the flavor and texture  upgrade. The all dressed hot dogs have a nice slaw on them that elevates the meat heavy meal. I like the almost brusque service."}
{"text":"Friends and I decided to hop on over to this place for a quick, simple bite for lunch. My boyfriend talked up this place for the entire morning, so I was a little skeptical.   We ordered some steamies and a fry to split, and by the time I had finished washing my hands in their INCREDIBLY CLEAN bathrooms, it was all ready to go!  We ate in, and it's nothing very special to look at, but in the middle of the day, it wasn't packed or terribly noisy, so we welcomed the atmosphere. Steamies were good, but the fries really took it home. Really crispy, really hot, definitely worth the walk. Definitely the place to go if you're looking for something good and greasy."}
{"text":"Went to use the ATM at this DUMP.. (falls very short of being called an establishment). Mind you, I asked to use the bathroom & was told NO! The bathrooms are for paying customer's only! What about the fact the ATM machine was charging me a, $3.50 surcharge?! Needless to say, the cashier & cook SCREAMED at me when I preceded to walk to the ATM machine, thinking I was going to use the bathroom, OMG!  The workers were extremely Scarey and UNPROFESSIONAL!!  Don't waste your time at this joint.. workers were: rude, obnoxious, angry and not very welcoming! Don't even bother with this DUMP!! RUN, FORREST, RUN!!"}
{"text":"I guess this place has a certain cachet because of its age and location but it didn't make up for the quality of the food and the nonexistent ambiance. Granted I was there at 2 am on a Monday morning. Still the staff couldn't seem more disinterested I worried  when the relish and kraut were prepared. There's a curious wall where lots of montrealers have put their business cards."}
{"text":"VIBE It's dirty. It's divey. It's steamies. What else do you expect? There is an impressive collection of Montreal maps on the wall. The servers look like they hate their jobs and everyone in the joint is drunk. There's a huge communal table in the back. Heaven.  I mean what more is there to love?   I ATE  Steamies. Duhh. La Traite was closed so we sauntered over here and wow, it did not disappoint! They put way too much onion/chopped cabbage on the dog but  for $1.35 what is there to complain about? Also, I'm curious as to the markup. If a pack of hot dogs is about $1.00 and they're charging you $1.35 per dog how much profit are they making? Why does this feel like Grade 7 math?  PS they charge $1.95 at La Traite so what is the difference in profit margins there?   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  How did I never not know what a steamie was? Is this what I've been missing all of my life?"}
{"text":"I was in Canada so I had to get some poutine. The last time I had poutine was in Toronto, at Poutini's House of Poutine. It was amazing, with sour cream, bacon, and chives.  But this time I wanted to try something more traditional. Poutine with just gravy, mozzarella cheese curds, and fries. My siblings opted for the same except with chicken and with tomato sauce. The small sizes are quite large, and the large is a platter. We did not finish our food.   We noticed that the other patrons were actually just sharing the small size. No wonder the guy at the counter was surprised with our order.  Three stars, because it was good, but it came out to about $25 Canadian dollars, which is over $20 US dollars. Fries shouldn't be that expensive, covered in cheese/gravy or not."}
{"text":"I get what this place is, an institution, which has been around since 1912.  But that doesn't mean we can't expect some effort. It looks like it hasn't been updated since 1960, an not in a nostalgic way. It is greasy, and that's before I talk about the food.  The food. It's burgers, fries, hamburgers, all done to order, and quick. I have had all of these things done much better. Had a cheese burger and a poutine. The cheese burger dripped of grease, excessively so. To the point of guilt. If you want to experience classic diner food, please go elsewhere. My girlfriend ordered the chicken burger and it was obviously from one of those Walmart frozen chicken burger packages, where you question what part of the bird that \"meat\" came from.  If you need a quick fix, go ahead. But I wouldn't suggest it."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Montreal. This place is the best place in Montreal for steamies & poutine.  I never, ever eat hotdogs or poutine except for when I come to my wonderful hometown of mine, Montreal. This place is amazing. Amazing food and great service!"}
{"text":"Montreal has a few landmarks and must-see dives and eateries, places which helped put the city on the map, places which defined the city back in the 60's and 70's. Many of them are now long gone (i.e Ben's Deli) but a handful remain, like The Orange Julep, Schwartz's Smoked Meat, and of course The Montreal Pool Room.This is the birthplace of the All-Dressed Steamie. It has changed location, they were at their former digs for almost a hundred years!   Even then, it sits literally in the middle of Montreal's red-light district so if colorful characters are your thing, you've hit the jackpot here. If on the other hand, sketchy-but harmless characters freak you out too much, don't bother and go hang out at your local mall instead.  Former Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa used to come here all the time for his hot dogs (the Premier of Quebec's office is in the Hydro Quebec building) which apparently Pierre Elliott Trudeau used to make fun of him for...until he started going there himself!  People usually come here after a night of clubbing or drinking since it's not too far from the Gay Village and the staff here have always been super laid-back and chill."}
{"text":"The Inventor    Oh yes, they created the all dressed hot dog.    that is all.  Waka waka"}
{"text":"The taste is normal and the price is not expensive. Just for filling the stomach."}
{"text":"Must do in Montreal. The service is quick and friendly. Fries were crispy and hot dogs were great!  We got the poutine and hot dogs meal. It's nothing that's going to be super fancy but it gets the job done. Quick and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Fast food, simple , Staff smily and fast service. The place need a deep cleanning care. I dont agree that this place stay so popular in the tourist books only because open in 1912... but why not if you are hurry. Just saying dont spect more than easy food."}
{"text":"Out of all the places I visited for Poutine in Montreal I thought Montreal Pool Room was the best.    The poutine here is really good and the portion sizing is huge.  Plus you can get it with a steamie combo for around $10.    But if you get the poutine on your own it is a large portion and very good.    I tried out about 5 different places for poutine and this place is it.  My pick, and yea people will say Le Banquiste but I personally found this place did poutine better, with larger portions and without baving to add a whole bunch of weird toppings on their poutine.   Montreal Pool Room you have earned my 5 stars"}
