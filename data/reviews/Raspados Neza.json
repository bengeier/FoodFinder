{"text":"This place is the biz..i went in here with my boy Big Juice and our pregnant friend Alan the owner was really nice he treats us like family he made a special raspado for our pregnant friend and said \"las mujeres embarasadas ahi que consentir las\"  will be going back Ramon is trippin doug"}
{"text":"I had got back from Mexico and had the most delicious raspados, coming back I came along this place and had the tamarindo raspado... its was nothing like I was expecting. This place looked authentic with real fresh Mexican raspado recipes but it wasn't. My raspado tasted like radishes never again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited for the first time after a recommendation, best raspados we've ever had, on the other hand owner was rude, literally told me I couldn't sit down they were closing in 30 min, I asked about their flavors and refused to answer and ignored me, I have to hand it to him he makes a heck of a raspado! Unfortunately I won't ever be visiting again!"}
{"text":"This place is ALWAYS closed! I have a distant memory of the Raspados tasting heavinly but the memory of the taste is quickly fading away. I've been trying to go for months & It's never open, makes me sad. I miss these tasty Raspados, they reminded me of the ones in Mexico. If they were consistent with their hours i'd rate this place 5 stars & I'd be a happy Raspado eating woman"}
{"text":"always rude!  everytime i go, its closed.  and when asked what time are they open, they dont know... really?!  interesting....  close your business, no point in being open!  customer service always sells not the product.  people and businesses like theres,  always puts a bad reputation to the hispanic families that are hard workers with excellect work ethic.  mal servicio seguro.  lastima de productos."}
{"text":"Muy ricos raspados! Sin duda! Pero el dueño muy mal educado! No tiene educasion en como tratar a los cliente! Se los recomiendo si no les importa salir humillados! Buen dia...."}
{"text":"Pro: raspados muy deliciosos y el servicio de vez en cuando. Limpia localización.  Con: no horario ficho y tampoco teléfono donde llamar.  Me gustaría que tuvieran un horario ficho o un número de teléfono donde llamar para asegurarme que estén Abiertos. El servicio puedo mejorar."}
{"text":"The raspados are absolutely delicious however their hours are unreliable. My husband and I went today at 1240 because the website said they open at 1200 but they were closed. I was craving their cajeta raspado :("}
{"text":"For the past 4 months I have been trying to get a raspado here and every single time that I get there the place is closed but the employees relaxing inside and the sign says that it is open. Very upsetting.."}
{"text":"This place started out ok? But now they are the most rude and inconsistent raspados around. The business owners should learn good customer service ethics. Its not the product that customers come back for. Its how customers get treated!  Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever...just because I asked if they are real or artificial flavors I was treated like shit. What assholes!"}
{"text":"I will not be returning to this place. The owner of this establishment was so rude to me and my family that I wanted to punch him in the face. You can't ask him a simple question without him responding like an ahole. He is losing so much business that pretty soon he will have to shut down. Treat your customers like gold, not like sh#t."}
{"text":"MMM their raspados are super tasty and refreshing. My favorite is nuez and coconut."}
{"text":"I am so sad !!! we have being loyal customers of this place almost 2 years, we knew that the owner was kinda  sarcastic and a clown mix , but we never had a bad experience until today.we invited our family that are  visiting from California to have the best Raspado  there is around us!! We spend almost $40 and when my sis in law wanted to use the restroom they said was out of order. which is a lie , because my nephew went to use  it  5 minutes before . when we asked they acted like we asked for their kidney Rude and unpleasant!! The city of Avondale require for the food industry to have a restroom ,when your place has tables and chairs on the premises , there for you LIARS remove your tables and chairs and continue selling your product but one thing you want you to know ,,, you losing your customers because you are so arrogant !! You are in Us not in  México bad versión of Rigo Tovar !!! So go back to México And treat your people  like shhh&$&&; but not Us!! we Work hard  for our money and we go to spend our $$ in your place!!!"}
{"text":"The product itself deserves 5 stars, but the owner's attitude brings it down to a 3 for me. If you're up for crazy good raspados and don't mind poor customer service, come here. I'm not joking. I'd be willing to drive the 30 minutes it takes me to get out there just for a raspado if it weren't for his attitude."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE place no lie the man is so rude, I mean okay sure he makes good razpados but it doesn't mean you gotta give your loyal customers attitude and his prices have gone up so much he's out of his mind when he opened up his place a small raspado costed like $3 and now they cost $9 for a small!!!!! And $12 for a large their crazy literally it's just water with fruit in a cup I will never return to this place ever again there gonna run out of business anyways :/ I certainly don't recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"as i was waiting for my raspados happily in line imagining the awesome taste..... i finally got my vanilla and pistachio snow cone. then i nearly threw up in my mouth when to my surprise a big ass curly hair saluted me ; /      i then walked back to the counter and noticed the owners mullet and realized that hair belonged to him!!! i nicely told them and proceeded to show them the not so fun surprise....and they nervously smiled and asked if i wanted a new one....NO THANKS!!!! ill have my money back.... word of advise raspados neza owners invest in some nifty hair nets!!!!"}
{"text":"Today I made the mistake of stopping by this dark and nasty place. I had passed by a lot of times to find out it was closed every time. I finally found it open and went in and saw very high prices and very rude customer service. I tried making conversation with the owner to say I had noticed it was closed and he responded by asking me if i went to school and if I know how to read because there was a sign at the door. He said it in a sarcastic and rude tone and quite honestly the best thing I did was walk out. The times I passed by with my daughter there was no sign anywhere. If you're looking for good service, pricing, etc. don't go there."}
{"text":"Best raspados ever!! I had the arroz con leche. The owner was giving kids candy for Halloween, that was a nice gesture"}
{"text":"Their raspados are good but the service is not. The owners are extremely rude. Do not spend your money here there are some in downtown worth the drive!"}
{"text":"So delicious, i have been looking for a good real raspado place and finally ive found it! It sucks that its like 45 minutes from where i live but when im on that side of town i have to get a raspado. Yummyyyy!"}
{"text":"If you've never had a Raspados you need to go try it as it was very good. I was a newbie and hoped the owners could run me through how it works and what to get but they speak very little English so I was mostly on my own. They did try though. I guess I could blame my lack of Spanish instead of blaming their lack of English in a Mexican store. :)  Anyway, I had a medium Pineapple/Coconut with a little condensed milk and outside of the sugar coma afterwards it was really good. Look forward to trying different flavors in the future.  A Raspados is basically a snow cone made with sweetened real fruit. None of that colored syrup at this place."}
{"text":"Worst customer service! The owner (with his nasty jheri Curl) was so disgustingly rude to me and my family that I will never EVER return. After spending almost $50 in raspados, this disgusting, hideous man refused to allow my son to use the bathroom. We are his customers, we are not random people just walking in?? I will never return because of his horrible customer service. Shame on you, puma wanna be. He should be wearing a hair net with his disgusting long stringy hair going all over the ice"}
{"text":"Their flavors are delicious and far from being artificial like the American snow cones. I recommend the chocolate, pistachio and vanilla, all with cream. So far those are the ones I enjoyed the most. I still got to go back and try others!"}
{"text":"Summer is here, try Raspados Neza and post your own review, the raspados can be really good but they are better when made with love and a smile. Great happy service = a lot of return guest"}
{"text":"Pros: - Very clean - Best raspados I've ever tasted  Cons - alA little pricey - Worst customer service I've ever received  My family and I will not go back. Terrible customer service. Owner was rude, didn't want to answer questions, didn't let us sit down although they were gonna be open for 10 more minutes."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved these Raspados! Apart from being delicious, the are authentic and made with real fruits. I loved their concept of mixing  the ice, syrup, and lechera. I have never had a raspado as great as the one I had today. I cannot wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Worse place ever. Awful service, and the people their are rude! DONT GO!!!"}
{"text":"Last night, after eyeing this place for the last couple of weeks, I decided to stop by and give it a try. They were turning their \"Open\" lights off already, but I made my best effort, with my big puppy-eyes, and asked if they could still prepare a \"raspado\" for me?? The owner said yes, of course, they still had enough for the whole group of people I was talking to just outside of their establishment, after our meeting. Well, sure enough, almost all of us got to enjoy this delicious treat, which is shaved ice, but prepared \"Neza\"- style. Neza is a suburb in México State, right next to México City. The difference here is that the sweet is not simple-syrup based, but fresh-fruit purée based. It was delicious!!  I had the Cajeta (caramel) my husband got the tamarind, and both were gone in no time. The owners are very nice and funny, don't be scared if they invite you to dance before you order, ok?! Recommend it a 100%"}
{"text":"Being in the area I decided to stop by to grab a raspado and the experience was not the greatest.  The atmosphere in the raspado shop is not very friendly, I felt really uncomfortable. The man who makes the raspados (the owner) has a hprrible attitude and is extremely rude. One other customer who was after me had a question about the flavors and the man who seemed bothered with her question, told her to wait that the cashier would answer her question.  That was unnecessary, in my opinion he could of just answered her question.  Main point the service is horrible but the raspados are good.  Which is a bummer, if only he worked on his service and improving his attitude and not being so rude, I am sure he would have more customers returning.  This is the reason I stopped coming in the first place 3 years ago and will not be returning again!"}
{"text":"No fuss little store front that serves up some delicious frozen goodies. We had the cafe, arrozo con leche, strawberry with cream, mango and my personal favorite mangonadas which is a combo of mango, tamarind, chile, lime and even comes with tamarind candy. Perfect for a hot AZ day!!!"}
{"text":"Very rude service. Will not go there again. Also after seeing the back door open and letting flies in. Gross!"}
{"text":"Tanarindo and nuez were amazing! U can tell they use quality ingredients In The syrups mmmm"}
{"text":"Great taste, loved them. but ALWAYS CLOSED... The owners should get their crap together and post a schedule that they're actually gonna follow. It's not fair, every time I try to go a part of my heart breaks down because it's always closed. We need you guys, we need raspados in this world. Please guys come on don't be like this..... :'("}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to Raspados Neza since it opened, and we love these raspados as much as the first time we went."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite raspado place. They stopped using fresh fruit. The mango is cooked I'm guessing to help preserve it, but the texture doesn't go well with some of the combinations. I'm so sad, I loved the way everything was done before.   They also close for the winter and don't return until February, for the people wondering where they are. I was very disappointed when I was pregnant. Lol"}
{"text":"I love how clean this place is. Raspados are also very delicious and you get to choose whatever flavorings you want. The only downside is that in the last year or so they've raised the prices on a small raspado about 2-3 times, it's more than Starbucks! I believe a small is about $6. Nonetheless it's a great treat from time to time."}
{"text":"We went there last month and had the rudest experience.  When we asked if they served raspados con nieve the owner(lady) had a cow and told us to go elsewhere.  We still gave them our business but never again.  We have found a much better place in the area that know something about customer service unlike this business.  Gracias por nada!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I use to frequent this establishment prior to moving 30 minutes away. Every time we are in the area, regardless of the time they are ALWAYS closed. Finally decided to stop by in hopes that I could get lucky and to my surprise there was staff inside. The business hours are not displayed on the window so I decided to knock on the window since the door was locked at 11:45 in the morning. I questioned what time were they open and she stated at 2:00. HOW AND THE HELL DOES AN ESTABLISHMENT MANAGE TO STAY OPEN WHEN THEIR BUSINESS HOURS ARE SO RANDOM.. Unfortunaly I will not further pursue spending my money at Raspados Neza... Very unorganized it seems and have yet to establish standard operating hours!!!"}
{"text":"Don't call it a snow cone. Dude is a craftsman. Having these handmade homemade desserts is always a joy and worth the trip. They are the real deal. The family that runs it is super sweet."}
{"text":"The raspados were ok.  Being that I just moved from Miami, I was used to a different texture and flavor.  Overall, it was good.  The place needs a little TLC as far as aesthetics go."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my friends to enjoy a raspado and had the worst customer service experience. As soon as we walked in the door the owner approached us and gave us a flyer for the boost mobile store down the street, I thought it was a bit odd. Am I here to get a raspado or to have a pushy guy give me a flyer and tell me to go buy a cellphone?  We placed our order and stood in front of the other counter where he was preparing our food. As we're waiting another customer shows up and instead of having the lady at the register take her order he stops making our raspados and goes over to the customer and gives her a boost mobile flyer! It was just so bizarre, my friend tried to tell him she wanted her ingredients mixed together and he was completely rude and condescending.  He doesn't know how to talk to people and isn't a good business owner in my opinion. I ordered the rompope flavor and it was okay but I would never go back to this establishment based on the way my friend was treated.  I also think that the people giving this place 5 stars either didn't deal directly with the man I'm talking about or don't speak Spanish because if you do you'd pick up on his extremely bad attitude."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Raspados place. So underrated, they deserve more attention for the quality, taste, and love they put in their raspados :) every flavor is good. Wont disappoint. He carefully layers and packs the ice, syrup, fruit, etc for you. It's not the typical Raspados that taste like snowcones. Each syrup flavor has been cooked perfectly with real bits and chunks of whatever fruit/nut flavor you get. Clean environment, great hosts; will never get tored of this place."}
{"text":"Best raspados around I've tried others but they taste watered down compared to these."}
{"text":"Just go here. It is delicious. Nothing better on a hot Phoenix day.  This isn't your American snow cone. This is fresh shaved ice with fresh fruits and juices. I haven't had anything like it before. I got mango and strawberry with leche. Me and the baby loved it. My husband had a spicy lime chile mango tamarind creation that he devored. The owners were very nice."}
{"text":"First time here with my family and received a bad service both of the owners we're very rude to my family, never will I come back to this place it's very disturbing n very upset. Les debería dar vergüenza!!"}
{"text":"Was a little hesitant about coming after reading the reviews about the owner not being nice. To my surprise everything was fine and they were very attentive to us. He even gave my daughter some arroz con leche for her to try it. The raspados were very delicious, but I think they are a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I had the Pino Diablito. It was my first time to have diablito. It's spicy, sweet and sour!! It was great and refreshing! The owner was nice and I didn't have the bad customer service experience. They didn't speak perfect english but was able to communicate with me.   I will definitely go back to try something else!"}
{"text":"I went into Raspados Neza this afternoon, I kept hearing how good it was. As I walked in the first thing I saw was a retired Temerarios band member making the raspados. I was very happy being that I am a long time fan. I took a glance at the menu, I ordered the Limon con mango Raspado. It was very delicious we started convercating and soon I noticed this guy is also a comedian he was comparing my pregnant friend to a sea horse. over all this place is both delicious and entertaining will be going back soon"}
{"text":"The arroz con leche raspado with 3 berries was delicious!!! Someone else had the pistachio one and it was also very good. Service is fast and friendly I definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"This business has extremely poor work ethic. I read the reviews prior to coming here and they were mostly low. However, I decided to give them a chance. I went for the first time and they were close due to \"family emergency.\" I was annoyed but I understand that family emergency do happen in the most unexpected times.I went again today and AGAIN they were closed! Their hours in Yelp says from 11am - 7pm. They were closed at noon!! There was a lady cleaning inside and she just kept signaling for me to leave. I knocked until she opened and she said that they open until 3:00pm. I gave her a piece of my mind and told her that they should change their hours of business and be more reliable. She didn't apologize. She just kept on making motions for me to leave. I ended up going to \"Antojitos Your Way.\" They items are delicious and the workers are so professional and personable. Save your self the anger and waste of time coming to this place. It sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"One star for the customer service. The older gentleman with long hair was extremely rude. I don't understand Spanish as well as my partner but I can definitely see the attitude in his voice and how rude he was when my \"Tia-in-law\" asked him a simple question.   4 star for the raspado because I have never tasted one so good. Unfortunately, the attitude is definitely one of the reasons why I would not go back."}
{"text":"Ive been going for months the raspados are good. Arroz con leche/ 3 berries.  Until today i dont know why i never saw how rude the owners were but until i had a horrible experience today. All i can say is they dont not know what customer service is. Its something that should be taken care of as business owners. It doesnt look like there will be a next time im not going to support there bad attitude!"}
{"text":"I had an extremely uncomfortable and weird experience, which falls in line to what many people on the other reviews are saying. The Owner a Man with long hair was extremely rude for no apparent reason, short with his words and demanding. I would say avoid the place at all costs. No Shaved Ice is worth being treated like less than human, this isn't Seinfeld's Soup Chef."}
{"text":"My kids love the Mexican snow cones. Everytime they want to come here they ask for a raspa de el \"buki\" because they think the owner looks like the Mexican singer \"el buki\" I don't think they even know the real name of this place. Anyway, he does have the best raspado but they are a bit too pricey which is what keeps us from coming more often. With 5 of us and at $5.00 a raspa, a single outing for snow cones quickly turns into $25.00."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife hoping for a nice cool treat, I got the Diablito wich has chamoy, chili, tamarind and lime, my wife got the strawberry and cream. These were absolutely the worst tasting things we have ever tried. Mine was bitter and sour and not at all appetizing. My wife's strawberry and cream tasted rancid like either the cream went bad or the strawberry a did. We had to throw then away after just a few bites, an unfortunate waste of money."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Practiced my spanglish with wife(?) and ordered a medium Diabolito (Mango Chili flavor). Her young one handed back my change. So sweet. The husband(?) master crafted my raspado complete with mango straw covered in chili. Rather monstrous serving complete with 2 spoons for wife & I to share and handed off with a wonderful contagious smile.  Don't be put off by these off colored reviews. These people are really nice and their product is outstanding. If there was a bad Customer Service experience, I'm guessing it was the Customer that caused the bad experience...and fresh fruit or not, these drinks are still hitting home runs - this isn't whole-fancy-dale people!"}
{"text":"Ok, we have been trying to find a good raspado (Mexican snow cone) place for a while. AZ was starting to disappoint me. I have had raspados in Mexico but like i said have struggled to find a place similar to the ones in Mexico. The raspados I had here have been watery and full of ice which is your typical american snow cone. The best we had found was in Tempe, which is way way too far for us. We yelped raspados in the west valley and thought we would give Raspados Neza a try. We walked in and saw a menu with limited items, only raspados, which was ok cause that's what we were wanting. The owner was a sweet talkative man who was proud of his product. I was scared this would be just another watery raspados with nothing but ice and hardly any lechera (sweetened condensed milk). So we ordered, I selected the pecan raspado, my husband the arroz con leche (rice and milk, has an horchata taste but thicker) and my daughters the coconut and the strawberry raspado. We had them all with lechera. I had my first sip of my raspado and OMG I was soo happy! My pecan raspado was sooooo delicious. It was creamy, tasty, and had the perfect amount of ice. Some places add ice cream to the raspados, which I love, but these did not need them at all. I tasted all my family's raspados and all were so good. Also one thing to keep in mind is that these raspados are naturally flavored and have no preservatives. So they are not too bad for you. The raspados are $3 for a small and $4 for a large. So this is it guys we have conquered in finding the best raspado in west Phoenix. Thank you Rasados Neza we will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I'm so sad about how greedy these people have gotten... I used to love going there and having a raspado all the time. Every time anyone came to visit me, I would take them to have a raspado. Two things I'm disappointed  about: first is that I pretty much started going there ever since they opened. The small raspado was $3, large was $4 and kids size $1. A few months later they raised the price a dollar more. I went there today with some friends and now the small raspado is $5!!!! And the large is $6 and the kids $2.50. Are they out of their mind!!! I rather go to Jamba Juice or go have a Boba drink for that price. The second reason is and I think someone else mentioned this before in their comments about CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! If you make the raspado with a smile or at least pretend...it will taste better. I used to think the man with long hair was nicer, but once the wife took over... It's a different story.... She is so rude!!!! Does not greet customers in a friendly way and if you ask her questions about the raspados or anything.... It's just disgusting to see her face!!!!she has no manners whatsoever!!  I will not be going back to this place anytime soon. Too bad because their raspados are really good. But to me these values are much more important, especially if I'm gonna be  spending my money on it."}
{"text":"This is a nice, cute little mexican style snow cone joint.  That being said, it is literally the best snow cone I've ever had.  Most authentic flavor you will ever find.    You could tell the owners who work there are super passionate about their product.  The owners are very pleasant, the place was clean and service was great!  I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place!  You'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Very good Raspados we had the pineapple, strawberry, and the mango with a lil chamoy on top. We loved the big chunks of fruit that came in it. A lil pricey but worth it."}
