{"text":"Great service and great place to grab some drinks and chill for the night. We tried their recommended 30th anniversary menu, they were great! Wish that menu is on the regular menu because I would like to go back there sometime later."}
{"text":"i live within walking distance... always friendly staff and owners... Shoeless Joe's has a good menu and quality food compared to other sports bars and pubs imho.  Recently they added a Nashville Hot chicken sandwich that is spot on.  you get 2 big pieces of chicken.. i took one off and ate it with a knife and fork then had the other as a sandwich, absolutely delicious!  i just wish they didn't get rid of the pinball machine."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on a first date and ordered the lunch special Buffalo chicken rap.  It was not good. When I say no good I mean I got food poisoning and I only had 2 bites.  When I told the waitress she responded immediately with \"no one ever complains about our food\".  Almost as if to say I'm lying.  She didn't even take the food away. It stated in front of me the whole time until my date was done her food.  The waitress never even came back to ask if we needed refills.  5 minutes after I left I called to speak with the owner. He responded exactly like the waitress.  Almost like it was rehearsed... immediately with \"no one ever complains about our food\".  The when I told him I myself own a restaurant he responded with \"what do you want from me?\".  I told him I wanted nothing I thought he would like to know since it appears his waitress tell him no one ever complains.  What a crock of sh**.  I ended up getting sick to my stomach about 2 hours later.  I wrote to head office. Waited a week for them to respond but they don't care either. I didn't get a call or email from them.    I will never go to any Shoeless Joe's Restaurants no matter where they are.  They are all going out of business for a reason. I just found it."}
{"text":"I had one of the power bowls and it was divine !! My son had fish and chips and my daughter had pizza, both very reasonably priced for kids menu and great portion sizes.  The prices are great compared to some of the dining near us in the suburbs of Toronto.  I highly recommend   ."}
{"text":"Best patio in Aurora. Great place to watch UFC or the game and enjoy their amazing chicken wings (I recommend the salt and vinegar dry rub, classic style,  not breaded).   I never order cocktails/mixed drinks as my taste favours wine and beer, however,  Shoeless Joe's is the ONLY place where that changes.  Their drink menu is exciting and fresh and offer some creative combinations with beer or wine. My favourite is the lime margarita with an upside down Corona in it. On a hot day (or evening), sitting on the patio with one of these is heaven.  So much so that I just got a craving thinking about it.  However,  for the past 1.5-2 years the Friday-Saturday night crowd there keeps getting rowdier, crazier and younger (I'm in my late 20's, so I'm talking young.  Like 19 years-old, can't handle their booze or moderate their behaviour young). I really think the owners, mgmt and staff could control the craziness that nearby residents have to listen to frequently from midnight-3:30am most weekends."}
{"text":"Good place to have a pint.  Food is decent and atmosphere is great. We will definitely come back.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"My husband and I never write reviews but this is a MUST...  I wanted to voice my complete and utter dissatisfaction with my recent experience at the Aurora location. I visited this location today (Sunday June 16), was seated on the patio and commenced with my meal.   The server, a thin blonde girl, took me and my husband's order, poutine, 2 closer sandwiches. We ordered the poutine as an appetizer, but soon realized after it arrived we noticed that there was a huge dead fly cooked in the dish- it was obvious it had been fried in with the food.  We were upset with this but did not let it ruin our meal, we let the server know and she took the poutine back to the kitchen.  When we returned she let us know it would be taken off the bill, which of course it should, we only ate 2 bites before discovering the fly. What struck me as odd is that they just took the poutine back and did not ask if we wanted anything else or if we wanted a fresh batch of the dish again.  Needless to say, we did not find this to be a good resolution and we asked that something more be done. The waitress then told us she will inform the manager at the time, and tell her to come speak to us directly. When the manager on duty arrived, another blonde lady, name not given, she told us the best she could do is 10% off because we were on the patio and there is no way of guaranteeing that the fly didn't fly in while we were out there.  We pointed out that it was dead and looked like it was baked.  She then said again what she could do.    At this time the original server came back and asked if we wanted any more water, in which I said \"yes, sure\". This is the point in which the experience takes a real turn for the worse.  The manager came back out again and told us that we are not allowed to harass the servers, and swearing at them is not tolerated.  We had honestly thought she was joking and asked if she had the right table, and said yes.  She claimed that the server said that I replied to the question of more water with \"well cant you see my F**king glass is empty?\". I had in fact not said a word, it was me that replied to more water.     It was at this point where i could not take this bad service any longer.  We were not only shocked but completely floored- where did that come from?? I said how offended I was with this poor attempt to slander us and that I was fed up and would not be paying for anything because of the way they had offended us, as if we were rude and low class.  The manager said that we must pay or else.    I offered her a little lesson on service and in the end I had to argue my way out of a bill that no experienced restaurant manager would have ever let me pay for due to the complete lack of care and service tied to this experience.  She did not understand the basic idea that the customer is for lack of a better term \"always right\". From the moment we interacted with the staff it was all as if it was the customers fault, with absolutely no apologic attitude throughout the entire bizarre experience.   I am not looking for anything out of this,  I just really thought as a company you should know what type of management and experience your locations are offering.  As a former restaurant manager myself, I understand this industry very well and know that creating great experiences and owning up to your mistakes are crucial in creating long lasting, loyal customer relationships.  To be blatantly lied to and not believed over the fact that we were apparently yelling and swearing has really put my opinion in that location to its ultimate low.  It is sad because the week before we went there and had an unbelievable experience."}
{"text":"Same old standard pub food that is processed in a bag and gets nuked. Not much of a bar, no live music or DJ. Patio overlooks the parking lot in a strip mall. Overall ho hum place with so so service.  Looks like every other sports pub with Leaf jerseys and such.  Other reviews obviously written by staff! lol"}
{"text":"Place was pretty small for a shoeless Joe's...but the food was really good, staff and service was stellar. Try the \"closer\" if your truly hungry for a chicken standwich. Crowd was younger hoodlems:) but they were all right to drink with....."}
{"text":"We went Saturday night and 3 servers and like probably 1 cook. It took 55 mins to come , than we got the platter and gave us 6.5 chips and than we asked for more and she gave us 10 more chips and charged us for extra chips !! After 1 finally being able to eat.. and also it overly expensive"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday evening around 5pm it was very empty in the dining area of the restaurant but it took a very long time to get one of the waitress's attention. She was in the bar area and clearly trying to avoid eye contact. Totally understand, since she was probably catering to the bar section of the restaurant but could have acknowledged me at least. We decided to seat ourselves instead and not too long after a waiter came. Very nice guy. We ordered honey garlic chicken wings in traditional but was very dry. The bones of the wings didn't come off easily. Flatbread was pretty good; savoury and a little spicy because of the banana peppers!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here tonight, the food was delicious, everyone in my group cleared there plate, I will be coming back"}
{"text":"This Shoeless Joe's is good. The food is tasty, the portions are decent and the service is pretty good. The staff is friendly and, for days when the weather's nice, there's a patio overlooking busy Yonge Street."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last 6 months. They have a great patio for sure but the food is not awesome. Its ok. Service was good both times. Both times it was packed with younger/teenage crowd talking loud. Else, not a bad place to chill and have some drinks."}
{"text":"Hands down the best bar in Aurora, with the best food, drinks, servers and patio!  Pool table, Bar games, and NTN which are rare finds in any restaurant or bar these days!"}
{"text":"I'm actually shocked that I am a fan of Shoeless Joe's in Aurora.  I really enjoy the food there.  I wouldn't have imagined that they would have decent food at pub but they do.  I keep having the salad burger which is excellent.  My husband had tried the boomboom chicken and the baked penne pasta.  All the selections we've have been good.  Their salads are very fresh with a nice variety of vegetables and lettuces in them."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is superb, the service is great, and well, the bar is full! In the lower bar there is a pool table (a rare and classic bar must have!), a pin ball machine, a golf machine, and a computer game machine at the end of the bar :)  This place is great, I suggest everyone come by for the great tasting food and drinks, cheers!"}
