{"text":"I was happy to see that  this mall has this restaurant because it is one of my favorite places to eat. I usually go to the Promenade location....and very happy there but Vaughn Mills its a totally differrnt story.... I am walking in with   my husband and two kids. Right at the front they tell me i have to leave my stroller behind...are you kidding me... no restaurant has ever ask me to do that before...what if one of my kids was sleeping? i actually  try to time it that way so i can eat a meal in peace.  Since we were all hungry i figured ok lets just stay in.I asked for a booth because it is easier to manage my 3 yr old in there.The waitress gave me a weird look and said that a booth is not available and we can  sit at a regular tabe...why...i do not know...the restaurant wasn't even that busy  .ok so i am getting pretty irritaded by now...i insisted of getting that booth...she gave it to us but with an attitude. I figured it can not get any worst than this lets just enjoy our meal.  As i am getting the menu i ask for the high chair...the waitress tells me she can not give me the high chair because we are sitting in a booth...what?!..i always get a high chair sitting in a booth and it is never a problem and maybe if you didn't take my stroller away i would be able to put my younger child in there.  At this point i asked for a  manager. She tells me how it is dangerous for my son to sit there because it is blocking the waitress to serve the food to our table  and the food is hot...and they are concerned about safety...believe me there was more than enough space    I was quite upset at this point so she brings me a high chair...the one that you are supposed to strap in to a chair...hello...i can not strap this to anything we are sitting in a booth...am i supposed to sit my 1 yr old child in a high chair that is not straped in into anything...i think that it is pretty dangerous!  Don't ask why but we stayed anyway with me and my child sitting on my lap.  BUT I TOLD MYSELF I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN ...EVER!  It is a waste of a good restaurant...poor management!  I would highly recommend the Promenade location. They have very friendly stuff...stroller no problem...you can sit whetever you like...with a proper high chair...really i have nothing bad to say except that.i am always very pleased with their service and of course that they have yummy yummy food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I'm a regular and I think it's one of the best pickle barrel locations. Downstairs is a very spacious dining area while upstairs is more of a bar that's pretty much right on Yonge and Dundas. Service is good, we once came last min with a group of 20 and they still accommodated well.   Food wise, they've kept their quality over the years and I feel like their portions are generally quite generous as well."}
{"text":"Shit service, shit food, shit facilities. Avoid!  Waitress seemed pissed to serve us. I had to ask her several times for the same thing, she still didn't bring it to me.   When my burger was brought to me, I couldn't believe it.. honestly looked like mcdonalds.  The bathroom was filthy"}
{"text":"The food is hit and miss, but service was so sub par! Our server forgot to get us forks and knives after which he forgot to give us our plates. The worst offence was that he assumed we wanted well done steaks so as he rolls in our burnt steaks we tell him that we prefer it medium rare. Upon which he proceeds to tell us how its normal to get the medium. However he finally agrees to get us a medium rare steak, which turned out delightful."}
{"text":"Nothing really special here but the bellinis are delish and never disappointing. I find sometimes these places lack consistency. My fav dish to order here is the shiitake mushroom chicken penne but last week when I was really craving for it, it was made really poorly. The sauce was watery and the chicken was so dry. Don't think I'll be coming back for a long while :("}
{"text":"A really nice looking deli with courteous staff was the good point now the bad. We ordered our food and asked for water while we waited. The server placed the water down and just before we drank we saw a big hair hanging off of the lemon. Ok stuff happens new water no biggie. I opened my napkin for my cutlery and on the fork was a big pierce of dried spinach ewwww. Details people. The food was ok don't order the Ruben sandwich the meat is like rubber. The manager comped us a free desert, very nice of her unfortunately it took 25 min to get to our table I guess when you get it free you have to wait longer. Anyway wont be trying it a second time."}
{"text":"Bad service+terrible food. It used to be good. Won't come again. Ingredients aren't fresh, and portion size has decreased significantly."}
{"text":"PB (Sherway) has always been good but today I learned this location is very very subpar.  We waited for nearly an hour for sandwiches/burger.  Service was terrible.  We ask how much longer and are told 2 minutes.  The waitress returns to literally shove bowls of salad in front of us and says it's complementary, like she's doing a favour for us and walks away.  We were all blown away by the lack of decent etiquette, no apology and an attitude that she clearly doesn't understand she's in the service industry.  We've never been so disrespected getting food so we just walked out and left.  DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE, there are plenty of restaurant options around the corner."}
{"text":"Despite a wonderful internal decor and an interesting menu, the service here is horrible. I blame it on entry-level servers. They are not knowledgeable about the food or cocktails, and haven't got the timing down for quality checks, refills and other obligatory duties. I was only able to see my server TWICE throughout the night of my dinner here! As for the food, it's adequate and prices are ok since they're a franchise company but still.... in a food city as great as Toronto, you shoudn't need to waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Slow service, food not all that great and had to wait 20 minutes mid afternoon to get a table. No drink refills and waiter did not give us any opportunity to flag him down. Salad had wilted lettuce.   We regret the decision to eat here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure this is a shining example of the experience one can expect from a Pickle Barrel. It is a bit grubby, a bit rowdy and a bit awful.    I'd skip this one and just jump on the subway and go up to Yorkdale or Yonge and Eglington."}
{"text":"Average, food was average. Too loud and chaotic, you can't hear yourself think it is so loud. Waitress never checked on us. Not a business I will revisit or recommend."}
{"text":"First no WIFI.. Odd, especially in the 'downtown core'.  Anyway, they sat us down (Thursday night) and not busy at all.  Took a little long to get to us. No biggie. We are not tough customers.  But the drinks we ordered were awful.  In my Black Russian I only tasted soda, old soda at that.  I even tried another type of drink.  Awful.  We sent one back it was so bad. My friend agreed.  Anyway, the appetizer was fried asian nachos/wantons or something - they were really good. But I had the Asian Chicken salad.  No taste, no spicyness - at all. And I asked the waiter if they had anything spicy since we were in Canada we know it is hard to find anything that tastes good, has any flavor, spice, etc.  But it was bland as .....  Anyway,  the menu is pretty big, but I won't be back, and we get up there often.  Several times a year for weeks at a time.  This one is crossed off my list.  Any something else - Canada, listen, ya''ll gotta do something about the way you serve mixed drinks!  Don't be so stingy!!  I think every bartender should take a trip to the U.S. to learn how to be a good bartender!  Then send all the chefs to Texas to learn what spices are!. Oh - I am an athlete. I am in extremely good shape so I indulge when I am traveling. I had the chocolate cake/fudgy thing,  pretty good."}
{"text":"I love this pickle barrel, although the decor is starting to look a little dated and the layout is kind of strange. But this review is mainly about the service and food. I alwyas get the best service here and the food is always fantastic! PB has such a great menu and its good for kids as well!"}
{"text":"Food is just okay. Large portions but that's all I can say about it. Nothing special or good."}
{"text":"Lots of good stuff - not crazy healthy but not bad either. Mostly tasty stuff. Good drinks menu! Would highly recommend for lunch rather than dinner, but it can accommodate both. Lots of tables so would be good for big groups - fast service makes it a good stop for mall days!"}
{"text":"Service at this location is incredibly slow even when the restaurant is only half full. It seems as if they don't have enough servers on the floor to assist to tables. Everytime I asked my server for a bottle of tabasco, I had to ask again and again until I finally went up just outside the kitchen area to get one myself. I caught my server texting behind their dessert bar as I was on my way to the washroom. The food I go was a pasta dish that had been sitting under a lamp for probably well over 5 minutes.  My experience at this location was terrible. I never want to return and I feel very bad because the simplest mishaps could have been prevented."}
{"text":"We came on a Tuesday afternoon and got seated pretty quickly.  There were quite a few empty tables.  We waited for the waitress for about 40 minutes... so we went to the front to see what was taking so long. Apparently they forgot about our table.  We got few dishes including a berry crunch super bowl and a spaghetti and meatball. When we got our dishes... the spaghetti and meatballs looked like a sad mess. There were only 2 meatballs..or should I say a meatball and a half... we were not impressed.  The spaghetti looked dry and shriveled but the manager assured us it was made fresh to order (when clearly it looked like they just reheated it). The chicken in the superbowl was on the dry side.  We asked the manager if we could switch out the spaghetti and meatballs. She made it obvious that she was unhappy with our request even though the plate of spaghetti was clearly old. There was no apology from the manager.. We didn't end up ordering anything to replace the spaghetti."}
{"text":"After a lengthy girls shopping trip we entered the Pickle Barrel for a relaxing drink and food. Unfortunately, what had been a fun filled day soon turned very negative due to very bad service. Our waiter(OZ) was just horrible. We were greeted with a prompt \"Are you in a rush\", followed by dirty looks every time we asked for anything. Even when we said \"Have a Good Night\" all we got was curse \"OK..,\" and an angry stone face.  Having said that, the food was excellent. The caesar salad was accompanied with well seasoned chicken and tasty croutons. The burgers were juicy well appointed. Kinda of scared to go back though."}
{"text":"I came to this location about four years ago - and a few other Pickle Barrels located in the GTA  - and I never had an issue; it was always a fine place to go eat and chat with friends and dates. But just recently, I came for dinner and came out very disappointed. The food tasted great, but service was just terrible. The staff at the front were great and friendly; but we just got lucky, I guess, and we received a waitress who just seemed to want us to leave from the minute we got there: coming every 5 min to ask if we need to order when we just ordered our meal, gave us means stares, and just gave us an uneasy vibe/feeling that we should hurry up eat, pay and leave immediately. We were there for less than an hour total! Even though it was Friday, there were a few tables empty near us, so I don't know why she would've acted that way. I love Pickle Barrel in general, but I have never experienced being so rushed in a restaurant or even fast food place before like that this past weekend!"}
{"text":"This used to be a good place to eat. Now they changed everything and not for the better. I tried on two separate occasions and everyone's food at the table really sucked! I won't blame the staff they were nice and very accommodating but trust me the menu looks mouth watering; the real thing just doesn't match. Ever heard of quesadilla without jalapeños and hot sauce?- yep so bland with zucchini ! Blah !!!"}
{"text":"WELLLL - going here was a waste of time.  Got to the restaurant around 5:20/30, hostess was away from her \"stand\". We had to wait a couple minutes for her to seat us.  We sat outside where there was 1 other couple (many tables occupied inside). Their server went over to them shortly after we sat down, but didn't bother coming by to greet us at all.   The server went by to the other table another 2 times and didn't come to our table once! I went to find the hostess or a server AND COULDNT FIND ANYONE TO ASSIST ME!!!   We finally decided to leave the restaurant around 6:00, or shortly after.  STILL NO ONE AT THE HOSTESS STAND - NEVER GOING BACK THERE!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this location pales in comparison to the one at Yorkdale Mall. A group of us had a birthday dinner here on a Saturday night in January, and all were disappointed by the very slow and disjointed service. Maybe they were understaffed, but everything seemed to take forever. Even basics like water glasses were overlooked. As for the food, it was pretty mediocre - bland, nothing special. The lobster mac and cheese was very disappointing, and the sausage penne was completely bland and flavourless. I'm a lousy cook, and yet my pastas have more flavour than that dish. On the plus side, this location does breakfast and sandwiches very well, which I might need to stick to in future!"}
{"text":"We went last night after Christmas shopping hoping to enjoy a great dinner. Unfortunately we were quite disappointed. On first impressions the restaurant looks a bit tired and depressing. My wife always enjoys her corned beef on rye when visiting other PB locations. When the meal came she asked for the usual hot mustard which is a staple with corned beef sandwiches. We were informed that they had run out the previous day. My wife replied \"that's fine but could someone not have gone shopping since?\" Another woman came over to our waiter upon overhearing this and said that PB was actually discontinuing serving hot mustard? Seriously?? Well PB I hope you are discontinuing serving your corned beef also then, wow! Anyway....on to my sons and my steak sandwiches. They were crap - enough said. 8ounce steak consisted of 4ounces meat and 4ounces of fat. Really gross. By the way make sure you have dessert plans elsewhere as you will be leaving hungry due to the really small portions.  Of course they do serve dessert by why reward them with more of our hard earned money!"}
{"text":"Nothing is as it seems...  The food almost tastes like frozen dinners. Don't let the fancy well not even fancy... decor fool you or dark dimmed atmosphere the food and drink is awful ."}
{"text":"One of those places that get chosen by default because there is nothing better in the area.    Have been boxed into coming here several times for lunch now since I started working in the vicinity.  All I can say is... \"meh, whatever\".  The menu is huge and extensive, but nothing is really done that WELL.  I've had their Cobb salad, french onion soup, grilled cheese sandwich the last few times I've been here.  As I said, nothing special.  Standard.  Your typical shopping mall fare.  I wouldn't go back again except for the fact that I know I will be dragged there by other work people.    The portions are huge though, so you will be stuffed.  In that way, I guess there is some \"value\" to the place.  The service is also OK, I have not had any of the bad experiences that others have had, although sometimes it can be difficult to flag someone down.    Would I go back again?  By choice, no.  By peer pressure, probably."}
{"text":"For a slow period (Saturday afternoon), this place was slow.  Service was slow as well as unattentive, and they didn't even offer to give me napkins or eating utensils, so I had to eat my Southwestern egg rolls with my hands.  I also ordered a Rolling Rock, which took me a while for the barkeep to even ask me for that order."}
{"text":"Food was only mediocre. I had a burger and the bun seemed like it was straight out of the bag, and the patty was crispy on the edges. I've eaten at a few other Pickle Barrel locations, and this one was sub par. I would prefer the food court at Vaughn Mills."}
{"text":"I have a total love hate relationship with this place. The food is pretty good, as most Pickle Barrels are, but the staff and the service is TERRIBLE!   I can't believe how rude the people at the front counter (not the hostesses) are to me every time that I go.  I go here for something different from food court food as i work in the mall and I'm always let down by the attitudes people have there.  If you hate your job, go so something else and stop ruining what should be a good establishment"}
{"text":"Busy spot but we were seated quickly. A bit of a wait for our drink orders to be taken and our food was slower to arrive than we expected. Our food was fantastic and our server was attentive, even once we finished our meals."}
{"text":"I go here often for dinner as it is right near my school and the location is convenient. In comparison to the other pickle barrel location I've been to (at Yorkdale mall), I have to say the food quality is consistent. As a vegetarian there are a few options, but I'm beginning to get bored with veggie chow mein, veggie burgers, and pasta (which are pretty much the options). There used to be a veggie wrap on the menu with gouda cheese (which was tasty although maybe not the best wrap I've ever had) however I recently found out that they got rid of this item! The drinks are quite good, and I love how they have a drink special every day (I think it's every day?). The drinks on special are still expensive, but they give you a lot and they taste pretty good (the fruity ones, that is ;] ).  The service has always generally been OK, but with a bigger place like this it's always hit-and-miss. The only service complaint I have is once when I went the fire alarm (or some sort of alarm) went off and was extremely loud, going off for about 5-10 minutes. During this time, most of the staff was confused as to what was going on, and since they had no idea, none of us customers had any idea either. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to take my things and leave or wait there because it was a false alarm! Eventually it stopped, but I don't even recall an apology from any of the staff afterward (and it was pretty annoying).  Overall the meals are quite average, and I would recommend going if you're in the mood for \"regular\" food."}
{"text":"RAW CHICKEN!! Is all I can say.....  Went with a friend and ordered the Chicken Parm. Got the dish and cut through the chicken- instantly noticed that the chicken in that exact spot was RAW. Called our waiter over (who didn't seem to care and didn't look surprised- guessing it happens often?!) and he took it to the kitchen. No Manager to apologize or an apology in general....   Horrible experience!  Looking through the negative reviews on here, there is clearly an issue with the restaurant."}
{"text":"I had such a great experience yesterday dining at the Pickle Barrel. I started off with the hoisen bites which my lovely server Hannah recommended. I then ate the pasta dish called the seafood linguini. The service however was impeccable. I felt as though Hannah was so attentive, and actually cared about the customer which makes such a big difference. Having good food and great service makes for a very happy customer."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy the food and atmosphere at PB. I'm not sure what happened...The service still sucks! There is no reason why pancakes should take an hour to make!! Not happy!!"}
{"text":"I went just the other night with 6 other people. They seated us pretty quickly, but the service was terrible! It took 20 minutes just to get our drinks and even longer to get our food! Almost 40 minutes. The food was average and our server was disappointing. He barely came to check on us! And we actually had to get up ourselves and find him! The restaurant wasn't even that busy. All i wanted to do after finishing my food was leave. It was ridiculous. But of course, leaving was a problem because getting the bill from our server took awhile as well. We were all very disappointed. The pickles weren't even good. I'd pass on this one if i were you."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends to catch up. The service wasn't too bad, the waitress was very nice. The water came without asking.  Two of my friends ordered all day breakfast. The portions were relatively small. I ordered a lobster and shrimp linguine. Very small portions of lobster but decent number of shrimps. The sauce wasn't too well done though. My other friend got a burger which is probably the best option along with steak."}
{"text":"It's one of my favourite restaurants. I have my favourites which are usually the sandwiches. Although I've been disappointed with the food before, the double Monty never disappoints. Of recommended the deep fried pickles but not the macaroni balls. My friend swears by the seafood linguini and always gets it.   Service can range from really good to below average depending on the location but I've never had a very bad experience when it came to service. I prefer the Yonge and Dundas location with the Yorkdale location a close second."}
{"text":"We had heard about the extensive menu at The Pickle Barrel, especially in reference to its likeness in diversity of choices to The Cheesecake Factory, and were excited to check it out after a movie at the nearby Cineplex. Please take heed to all the reviews regarding the service: It is EXTREMELY SLOW and for no apparent reason. There were 4 or 5 waitresses serving around 4 or 5 occupied tables, but most of the time they seemed to be chatting with each other while their patrons tried in vain to get their attention. I found myself having to actually get up and wave someone down more than once. On top of that, it took over 45 minutes for our food to arrive. Our waiter said it was due to the fact that downstairs was so busy, but when we went downstairs to use the bathroom, there were only around 3 occupied tables (???).   The food was pretty darn disappointing despite the endless choices. I ordered a side of field mushrooms and I honestly have no idea how they managed the impossible task of screwing it up. There was absolutely no flavor and it was dripping in oil. Even though I believe it cost only around $2, the portion was the size of a tablespoon (Are we ants? Or maybe the chef just thought we couldn't handle drinking the whole bottle of cooking oil along with our mushrooms). I also ordered a matzo ball soup and a plate of steamed mussels, which were both subpar. The matzo ball soup was very heavily salted and the matzo ball itself was bright pink on the inside - either as a result of undercooking or overfreezing. My companion ordered the lobster sandwich and proceeded to develop a stomach ache that lasted the entire night.   2* stars for the effort put into the menu, but I suspect that despite the choices, there isn't one dish on the menu that they make really well. Perhaps it's better to just offer one menu item and make it really well, rather than offer a lot of options and fail at making each and every one. So disappointed! We will not be back."}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times before but only recently for breakfast.  The menu is a little overwhelming with pages and pages of choices, but the breakfast was AMAZING.  I went with eight other people on a very busy Sunday morning and not one person had a thing to complain about.  Servings were HUGE!  Their milkshakes are homemade and a meal in themselves!  I personally enjoyed the multigrain french toast.  It was covered in berries and came with pure maple syrup."}
{"text":"I generally avoid the chain restauarants in this area, but it's tough when you're near Yonge/Dundas every day! I went for dinner on a Monday night and it was not busy at all.  I was pleasantly surprised to see big black booths and quiet, private-ish tables. The menu is varied with all-day breakfast, sandwiches, wraps, salads, burgers, etc. The bar was also quite big and seems like a good spot for a few drinks after shopping.   To eat, I had a big spinach salad with brie, cranberries, and candied pecans... it was actually the chicken spinach salad but I said no chicken. It's bizarre - they have about 15 'meal' salads and zero are vegetarian... the meat eaters won't even let us have salad... anyway, it was quite big and a good meal portion.   If you have to pick, I think Pickle Barrel has better food/atmosphere for dinner than Jack Astors.   Also, they offer free parking after 6 pm."}
{"text":"we've ordered tow different kinds of burger and it was good but the waiter was not that good he seemed disoriented and didn't help us much with what to order."}
{"text":"My experience was superbly positive. The waiter was very courteous and told me that he could get me any pasta without meat (I'm a vegetarian). The food was pretty good. Certainly a nice place to eat at especially if you're tired from all the shopping (window or otherwise) at Vaughan Mills"}
{"text":"Normally I am pretty generous in my opinions, however the Pickle Barrel was terrible! I couldn't find anything to like about it. The service was TERRIBLE! We waiting forever before even seeing a waiter / waitress at the table. Then the drinks took over 20 mins to get - we had pop. How long does it take to pump pop. Even if they had to change every single CO2 and Syrup and still wouldn't take that long. And then our very simple comfort food meals took over an hour. (This was a pre-show dinner. Time was not something we had a lot of.) After all that waiting the was mediocre at best. The place was not overly busy either. There were plenty of open tables. In addition to the waiting, the servers seemed like they would rather be stabbing themselves in the thigh with forks then be there. They were unfriendly, unmotivated, and almost rude. What a way to dampen your guests moods. A smile wouldn't kill anyone.  VERY DISAPPOINTING! When I spend my hard earned money, I except something in return. The Pickle Barrel gave me nothing but a bad taste in my mouth and terrible memories.  I am certainly not giving them a second change.   PROS: Leaving   CONS: Having gone in the first place."}
{"text":"It took forever to get out meal, there was a ton of hair in our food (it looked like someone cut their hair in our food on purpose and they delivered the wrong meals to the table. That was only the start of our experience at the awful Pickle Barrel.  I have been back twice since, only to experience the same poor service, bland meals and disgusting 'extras' you find making their way in your food like hair, and dust etc.    Pickle Barrel is an incompetent restaurant who has lost it's way.  Their menu is about 100 pages long and it is clear that this is a restaurant which serves many options that all taste like crap. It would be far better for them to focus on a few good dishes than 100 of them that are literally disgusting.  This is a great place to go if you're used to eating cardboard and low quality ingredients.  Then again, I may suggest you stick with the cardboard as it doesn't have hair in it.    Even after our complaint about the hair, they sent us a gift card for $25.  Guess what?  My gf wanted to go back to have drinks; against my better judgement I agreed and guess what?  There was zero dollars on the gift card they gave us.  No surprise for these incompetent fools.    Lastly, my beer tasted like a skunk. It was flat and old.  I hope this place goes out of business soon so we can free up rent for a more competent, forward thinking restaurant."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely fantastic, they catered to our group of 30 with almost nothing going wrong. They had great food for very reasonable price, and the wait staff were extremely kind and understanding. We had the choice of a starter a main and a a dessert. All were delicious. The salads were reasonably sized and were very fresh, the choices for the group menu were varied for everyone. Everyone enjoyed their meal and the portions were perfect. The dessert was amazing the lava cake was incredible, and our group really enjoyed the service and food overall. It was a great dinner and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were shopping the other day in the mall and needed to feed our baby lunch. Rather than sit in the food court, we opted for Pickle Barrel.   We ordered quickly, I ordered the BBQ, which I thought was brisket on a bun. It took an hour to get our order. We actually said to one another minutes before the order arrived that we'd leave if it didn't arrive soon. What I got was 2 burger patties and hidden underneath was what they claimed was brisket. It was actually the fat off the end of the brisket. There was barely any to no meat. Entire pieces were just shaved fat.   I complained and 19 minutes later he waiter returned with dry, cold shavings (not slices) of meat.   Here's what really gets me: 1. The restaurant was only half full. If you can't serve your customers in a timely fashion, open a smaller restaurant.  2. To cook and serve the brisket someone cooks and slices the meat. This is the first point where the fat should be rejected. The waiter takes the order. The expediter calls it out to the kitchen. Someone prepares the order. This is the second point of quality control where the fat should be rejected. The head chef oversees he preparation. This is the third point where the fat should be rejected. He expediter then receives the orders where they are checked, gathered and then handed to the waiter. This is the fourth point where he order is inspected. The waiter then brings the order to the table. This is the fifth point. When the burger arrived, I asked where the brisket was, he said it was under the burger as he slipped away. If he feature of the burger is the brisket, it would be on top, it was obviously hidden under the burger because they knew what they were serving. Despicable!  That's a minimum of 5 times that an order is seen and quality control should be redundantly be maintained. If a seasoned establishment like Pickle Barrel is missing this, it's not a sign of inexperience, it's a sign that money is winning out over quality.   I can only imagine what else goes on in that kitchen if all these people felt satisfied taking so long serving me fat on a bun.   HUGE FAIL! My family has been eating at Pickle a Barrel for as long as I can remember. We have been grumbling that the quality  has been on a down turn. I'm done. I will never eat at Pickle Barrel again. I just don't trust it.  So Pickle Barrel customer service contacted me. They apologized and asked for my contact info to send me compensation for my experience. I figured they'd ask me to take my family back Pickle Barrel to correct the experience.   Nope!  They sent me a voucher for a measly $15. After tax that doesn't even cover ordering the same meal let alone a drink, tip, or anyone else's meal.   After that experience, why would I rush back there to spend more money?  What a joke. Pickle Barrel, if you want a better review, you're going to have to stop dicking around your customers."}
{"text":"This location shouldn't even deserve a STAR out of 5. This is the worse pickle barrel location I have been to.  First, the servers are not attentive and they seem impatient. Not sure if this is because they are understaffed sometimes and the servers are rushing from one table to the next?  Anyways, about the FOOD.... I ordered buffalo chicken fingers with fries. They gave me REGULAR chicken fingers.. I told the server the buffalo chicken fingers are supposed to be coated in a buffalo sauce since I ordered it before, and she gave me this \"confused\" look . She said she will bring it back to the kitchen so that the cook can toss it up in the sauce.  She brings me back my chicken fingers like 20minutes later. This is when the other guests at my table was already finishing their food.  Throughout the whole time, I did not hear the server apologize."}
{"text":"I'm never coming here again and spread the word. I and the 16 people I went with each sent an email to head office about their terrible service and rude staff/management, and the reply was useless. We didn't even stay to dine, we walked out after an hour of waiting and been given false information. Vaughan's location is the worst, I'm not surprised with their ratings here on yelp. If I can give a -5, I would."}
{"text":"I've been here on numerous occasions. All of the times I've been here, it's been pretty good. However, the way they prepare my favorite dish, bruschetta is difficult to eat (still good though). I highly recommend for people to go on a week day, as weekends they are much busier, and you may have to wait a while for your food. The food also seems a lot fresher and less rushed on week days. The staff is very polite and even the managers occasionally stop to make sure you are having a good time. The mini-deserts are also awesome."}
{"text":"I am absolutely disgusted with the way my wife and I were treated by the MANAGER named MIKE. He was rude, disrespectful and extremely condescending!!   This man needs to retire from the restaurant industry!! I will never step foot into this Pickle Barrel until I know it is under new management.  It is quite unfortunate, considering I basically grew up being a Pickle Barrel customer. Shame on Pickle Barrel for having this man run the business in this manner.  HORRIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"Just opened in Vaughan Mills a couple of months ago. Good spot to go to if going with a group. A large menu (could use new ones, the ones we got look like then came from another of their locations, well used) so there is something for everybody. Service was friendly, however not very efficient, got my meal and had to ask for my soup! Everybody enjoyed their food and I had the corn beef on rye. Very good. When I get the deli urge, I will go back"}
{"text":"This was one  of my fav. Spots before I moved.Just good Canadian food(like meatloaf ,steak,salads,nachos),except sometimes the server can be too busy to check on you.Rest all good for common like home style."}
{"text":"Probably one of the shittiest Pickle Barrels you could go to. Place looked like it wasn't taken care of, and when we asked the manager if we could move seats she put up a fight that everyone needs to be seated in a certain place. It took a bit of an argument to be able to move.. this manager obviously doesn't care about this place whatsoever  Good food, poor management"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The Sherway Gardens Pickle Barrel is the best one I've been at - really nice restauarant, comfy seats, HUGE menu  I eat here at least once a week, and my food is always delicious. The menu is really large, so its a great place to bring people as in my experience there is always something to suit everyone's tastes.  I'm a vegetarian and usually get the veggie burger, or fettucine pomodoro. My meat loving friends have said good things about the bugers, steaks, sandwiches - everything  No complaints about this place!"}
{"text":"We came on New Year's Day to celebrate my mom's birthday but it was totally ruined by some very unfriendly service.  It was a cold day that night and my dad is 73 years old so he would liked some hot water.  My dad does not speak good English but he tried to tell the waitress he wanted hot water instead of the ice water.  The waitress was annoyed and she had an annoyed look on her face and then she brought the water after 20 mins.  I totally understand it was a busy night and did not mind the waiting.   After she brought our water she disappeared for another 40 mins, by then we were starving and when I finally saw her in the area I waved and told her we were ready to order, she coldly nodded to my request and disappeared for another 30 mins.  Eventually I stood up and started packing my stuff and was ready to leave, and then she came our way and asked what we would liked to order.  I was very dissappointed in the service, I totally understand it might be short staffed that night so the service was super slow. However, I also think we were racially discriminated from the annoyed look on her face when she talked to us.   I'm never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I went here for a going away party yesterday and let's just say the service was great and the food was very subpar.  I ordered the Hot BBQ Beef with BBQ sauce instead of their other choice: gravy. Anyways, maybe I'm not used to sandwiches where the bun is smothered in tomato pasta sauce (nope! not BBQ sauce as the name implied!) but it was just horrible. The sandwich was cold and so were the fries. They weren't even crispy or salted enough.  I'm just glad our waitress was awesome and friendly otherwise this place would have gotten a 1/5 from me. I guess the only good thing is the location, which is in the downtown core, very close to Eaton's Centre and other great shops.  Meh."}
{"text":"Does Pickle Barrel hire airheads?  I thought this PB location would be better than the Yorkdale location, boy was i wrong.  Upon arrival, and after being seated, i waited 10 mintues for my server, AFTER i had to ask the bus boy if he could grab my server. He was sweet and apologized.   When the waitress came, no apology for the wait, didn't ask how we were, i just had to basically tell her what i wanted.  Order the asian nachos, cause she said it was good.  -the soy sauce or w/e was too overpowering, didn't even finish half of it WITH TWO PEOPLE  Order the salmon penne -lacks flavour, just tastes like butter and cream with a pinch of salt  AMANDA, our server's name, came to check up on us twice. Never once asked for a refill of coke or water, had to ask another girl who was surprisingly polite and cheerful.  Amanda comes back to checks up on us AFTER the other girl already handled our needs. Thanks but no thanks.  The place was appalling, it was so disgusting and dirty.  From a 360 view, i counted 7 tables with garbage on the floor or tables, but tons of people working in am empty restaurant.  OVERALL  service 1/5 food 2/5 decor 4/5 cleaniness 1/5  Overall 1/5  First and last time at that location and probably any other pickle barrell."}
{"text":"Amazing service!  And amazing food! They messed up my order the manager immediately came to the table apologized made me a new burger and brought it to the table HIMSELF.!  And put it on the house!  Phenomenal service!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went last night. Ordered crispy calamari, buffalo wings, and coconut shrimp. Shared with my guest. The food was amazing. The waitress was amazing. The manager came to greet us. She was amazing. Very happy with the visit. Will return with a new guest."}
{"text":"Yay, I love this place! Even if it's located right at the busy downtown core of Toronto, I never had to wait long to be seated. The food is delish and the waiter/waitress is always really friendly.   mmmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I like to go here before 10:30 for their Early Bird Breakfast Special. $4.99 gets you toast, eggs, bacon, and fruit. However, their coffee is terrible, cold, and watery and the service is slow. For $4.99 though, it's a pretty good option."}
{"text":"We like this brand. We were in the mall Friday night, saw the restaurant and went for it. The food was good but the experience was well below the expectations. We went to the patio, the table was not really clean. It was full of I guess falling flowers. So we clean it ourselves. Then some one came to take the order. The food came within the expected time, we got another round of beverages and then the waitress disappear. We were waiting to get some dessert. Finally we decided to go to the cashier. It took more time to get someone attention than the food. The waitress somehow explained that she was covering many areas because they were understaff. Hopefully they improve these details. Good food, poor experience."}
{"text":"Such a good example of the old adage for success, \"location, location, location\". If it wasn't for the convenient location, I'd never go there again. About twice a year, just as the last bad memory is fading, someone suggests that we meet at the Pickle Barrel and I agree. Note to self: Find a better alternative.  The restaurant is pretty enough, and the service is decent (although, at times, overextended), but the food -- feh.  As other reviewers have said, the menu is too big for the cook staff to handle adequately. My latest meal was a BLT panini. Cold stale fries. I think the bread saw the panini grill several hours earlier. The tomatoes were an interesting colour (white in the center, barely pink on the outer edge), but I prefer them red. And why would they put an overcooked charred strip of bacon alongside with one almost raw on the same sandwich? The pickle was good, though, and all that I ate. That makes my lunch a $12 pickle. :("}
{"text":"Dropped by for an early dinner after work.  Service felt very rushed at first,  with the server anxiously trying to get our order.  Given the extensive menu and it only being my second time I needed a bit of time to go through the menu. I had the Pb burger with fries.  Burger was okay,  nothing to rave about.  The fries were better than expected.  Would not have the lobster tacos again."}
{"text":"Very pricey. I have had better food at places cheaper than this. Not really full filling either.  Service is good but I wouldn't go there all the time. Maybe on dates?  I am not even sure if it is a bar-restaurant. The vibe I get is swanky."}
{"text":"PB is like a Mega-Denny's and I love hitting them up for breakfast when I'm spending any time in Toronto. The portions are always substantial and the little extras (like real maple syrup instead of corn-based synthetics) help make the experience a step above a lot of other places. Even the bagel and cream cheese winds up being a full meal served on a platter covered with all manner of veggies. After visiting many times over the years, the food has always been consistently good and I've never had a bad experience in any way."}
{"text":"My experience here was weird as shit.  I came to the Pickle Barrel with two friends one morning a couple of months ago. We sat down, ordered coffee and drinks, and then waited. Forever. I'm not kidding. My friend's diet coke eventually made its way into the picture at some undefined point in time, but all three of our waters and the coffee just never came. There were maybe 4 other customers and definitely 3 employees working the entire time we were there. We all ordered something off the menu and NOT ONE OF US got what we ordered. And while we ate what we didn't order...we still didn't have drinks after politely reminding the staff twice. How the hell is this place still in business?   I do have to say that the staff atleast knew what poor service was going on and took several items off of our bill. I think I ended up paying 89 cents or some really weird amount. The experience was almost like being drunk in a completely sober state as I left the place thinking to myself, \"Did that just happen? Is this real life?\"  What a \"pickel\" that situation was."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here yesterday. It was a nostalgic choice for us, as we had enjoyed The Pickle Barrel downtown Toronto about 10 years ago or so, when my girls were very young. Unfortunately this location was absolutely horrible. None of the dishes we ordered were as described in the menu. One of the dinners was returned and when it arrived back at the table the vegetables were raw. (it was supposed to be a linguine pasta with lobster and shrimp) The lobster was fake, the noodles were chewy and the veggies were raw on the second attempt. The cost of this dish was $19.99. The Hanoi bowl was missing half the ingredients listed in the menu description, was bland and the rice was mushy. There were maybe four tiny pieces of chicken. I only finished half and left the rest. The turkey/beef dip was supposed to be served on a pretzel bun. It was not. The calamari appetizer had way too much breading, was bland and barely warm. The mussels appetizer was also disappointing. The mussels were small and over cooked, the sauce tasted like watered down ketchup.  My guess is that this location is suffering financially and cutting corners. Food is crap. Service was even worse. The server didn't seem to care that we were waiting forever, the food was crap and we were unhappy. We flagged down the manager who gave us 25% off. However when the bill finally arrived, it totaled $84; with a mere $8.75 taken off.  Please please don't eat here. You're better off to pick up a burger from the golden arches across the street."}
{"text":"I have tried this restaurant twice.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt that the first bad experience wouldn't be repeated.  Wrong!   We waited an hour to order our food and only because we chased down our waiter.    When it arrived (smoked turkey on rye) it was tasteless.  I've tried other locations and not had this bad experience.  Hopefully management will take note of the consistently bad reviews and turn things around."}
{"text":"I've been to Pickle Barrel at this location several times.  Food Quality & Price: Everything on the menu is similarly priced between $10 - $18 for entrees ($20+ for beef).  Appetizers around $10+. One reason I like the Pickle Barrel is for their extensive menu.  Their portions are large which means I always have to take home food. The quality of the food is decent, no complaints but not spectacular.  I enjoyed their pasta but my husband felt that the steak had too much fat and gristle.  Facility: Ambiance is nice, decor is nice. From what I can see/tell the eating space was clean.  Chairs were well maintained as were utensils and napkins. Pretty typical of a chain restaurant.   Service: Complete hit and miss.  The first few times we came to this location, our service seem kind of \"empty\".  Everyone seemed robotic and rehearsed. I requested lunch portions outside of lunch hours (dinner time) and the results were always inconsistent. First visit, my request was accommodated without an issue.  Second time, apparently it caused all hell to break loose in the kitchen, the floor manager came out to see us to tell us it cannot be done. Hey, I just wanted to be honest and not let food go to waste. Third time, my request went through without issue. From them on, though, I didn't bother but it DID affect my overall opinion on the establishment.   Waiters/waitresses (as I noted before) used to be pretty robotic.  But our last visit was great, our waitress was kind and funny (but not flirty - as handsome as he is, flighty servers annoy me). Our waitress was young but knew all the cues (when to leave, checking in at the right times/paces etc).  Overall: It's a good place to go to explore the large menu options (downside is that since there are so many items on the menu, they are generally mediocre). Don't expect \"excellent\" service or the same quality of experience twice.  The over theme seems to be \"inconsistency\".   I will probably return (out of convenience) but personally, and as others have said, I think I prefer the Yorkdale location."}
{"text":"I didn't want to come here, wishing to eat instead at the food court at Chipolte and save some money but another couple wanted to eat here.  We had the $10.99 mussels and a $13.99 Swish Mushroom Burger. The onion rings were a $2.99 upgrade. They did not tell us that. 99 cents to $1.99 would be reasonable but $2.99 is gouging.  The burger was bland and dry (C+). I wish not to rant but you have these burger places charging so much for a burger and the patty is bland. Too many places have bland burgers and this is one of them. It is not good when you have to add ketchup to create flavours. The onion rings were good but I've never had bad onion rings and they weren't any better than onion rings at other places (B-).  The $10.99 for the mussels were worth it (B+) that was tasty though the garlic bread was mediocre (C).  Averaged out it was a 73 or a B- to B, but because of the onion ring overcharging I'm going to subtract some points.  Our bill was $27.97 x 1.13 = $31.60 or $35 with tip, not worth the money, so more points off for that.  Slightly below 3.25 stars (or 65/100)"}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant and as such, the food is pretty consistent in quality. What distinguishes one location from another is the quality of service and the Sherway location is sorely lacking in this area.  I have come here many times because of the extensive menu,  hoping that service will improve, but alas, I am always disappointed.   It's not that staff are outright rude; they're just not interested in making your experience an enjoyable one. You wait a long time for everything: to be seated, to be acknowledged by your server, to receive your bill, to pay your bill etc., but hey, if you've got all day then by all means , go for a meal - you'll have plenty of time to eat it!    Don't let this location turn you off from enjoying Pickle Barrel as a restaurant - just don't go to the Sherway site."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on a Saturday.  It was my worst pickle b. dining experience ever.  The $15 salads that we had tasted awful.  The service was error prone.    PB catering service is great but the restaurant experience is lousy.    Definitely will not go back to this location."}
{"text":"The food is really good but the service is way too slow and tables are not clean , there's pièces of food ( Rice , fries, ... ) on the floor under the table which they assume its ready for next guest.  The menues are sticky. The lamp on top of our table was broken too.   Serveurs are So cool and don't care about cleaning or long waiting even for drinks.  They serve the drinks without tray. I didnt feel I'm dining in a clean and welcoming enviroment."}
{"text":"The environment and service is not bad, but the food is not good. As a restaurant, they should not be saving money by compromising on the good chief."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for dinner on a Saturday night and we were seated immediately. It took a while for our server to approach us and take our drink order. I got a chocolate milkshake and when it came I was shocked at the size. It was huge and only $3.99. However, the milkshake itself was bland and not very satisfying. We ordered a caesar salad and regular nachos with tomato sauce instead of meat. There was not enough cheese-- they had only put some on top so when you got through that layer there was nothing and because of the use of tomato sauce left the nacho chips a bit soggy. The salad was your typical caesar salad. It took a while to get our servers attention but she was friendly. Prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"I find this completely disgusting. A friend of mine working security there took this photo. This was after a weeknight. He then saw employees come in the morning to clean it up. All of that filth stayed there overnight! Disgusting ! Will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Definitely wasn't pleased. I've been to Pickle Barrel before at the Yorkdale location and I find their service and food much better. Upon walking into the restaurant, I instantly noticed that it was a little quiet in comparison to other locations that I've seen. Our service was okay I guess - the standard waitress came to take our order and got us our drinks but nothing extra. She didn't come check up on us to see whether we even liked the food. Not only that but when it came to paying for the bill, we waited for a really long time for her to get us our bill. The food wasn't as good as the Yorkdale location. My pasta came out way too salty. My pina colada was watery. The overall experience here just made me feel like there is a lack of effort into serving your customers well."}
{"text":"I have been here couple of times. They are probably one of the few places where you can get breakfast menu later in the day. I ordered the whole wheat french toast, and it was very good. The pricing is decent for a place this caliber."}
{"text":"I had dinner at the Vaughan Mills location on Monday at around 7pm. I sat down with 3 other girls and we ordered 3 appetizers and one Greek salad. We had the Nachos, calamari, and chicken quesadillas. Everything was fine until I woke up on Wednesday morning vomitting, having diarrhea, and feeling too weak to leave bed. This was the same case in all 4 of us who all ate the same food at your location on Monday. I've been to the doctor and have notified the York region infectious control board because we are all suffering from food poisoning.       After contacting their store and writing a feedback review, I was emailed back a very \"copy and paste\" looking email. The email consisted of a heartless reply stating that \"there's a bug going around\" and \"you are the only customer who's contacted us.\" I found it amusing that my friend had also left a feedback review and received the EXACT SAME email saying \"you are the only customer who's contacted us.\" I will never EVER return and I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Even thought the food is fine, the service is disappointing and inconsistent. The waiters are insufficiently trained and can be very rude to customer! I am writing this review because I am still waiting for my dishes for 30 min, after another 15 min before the corresponding waiter showed up to my table...frustrating!!  The bottom line: be patient and do not have work lunch here!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food. Do not try their spaghetti and meatball it's horrible. Other then that the risotto balls are gross, only thing that's good is ginger ale lol."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Their margaritas are green and not good. Their veggie burgers are cooked on the same grill as their hamburgers. I ordered a bowl with modifications, it tasted funny.  What was I thinking. I felt like a total crab so let them exchange the drink but stuck with the yucky tasting bowl."}
{"text":"Very good deal for a steak breakfast $13. Peter was very nice and helpful ! I will be returning."}
{"text":"One day for some reason I was craving a hot dog with sauerkraut, like the ones at the Brighton Hot Dog Shoppes in Beaver County. Where on earth could I find such a thing on the south side? Only at the Pickle Barrel.   They have all sorts of toppings for their burgers and footlong hot dogs, and they also make a big deal about their fries, which can be loaded with chili, bacon, cheese, or onions. It's standard greasy spoon kinda stuff, but pretty cheap and in a friendly (though not air conditioned) environment.  I see a lot of the south side old timers here for breakfast too."}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES A glorified deli that makes good sandwiches and barrels of very average pickles. A very good catering option if you require that kind of thing (though they don't accept personal cheques).  MENU RECOMMENDATIONS Egg salad on egg bread. Trust me.   SERVICE NOTES Umm, none. (as in no notes, not no service)  LOCATION NOTES NW corner of Yonge/Dundas. Sit down restaurant at street level and a quick deli directly below it in the lower level of the Atrium. This isn't the kind of place that's worth finding a parking space for in this part of town but if you're looking for a space around here I'd suggest the Ryerson lot. I always found that to be the cheapest option...6 years ago.  HUMOUROUS STORY My Mother once described a well educated person who spoke many languages as a \"cunning linguist\". My Mother."}
{"text":"Well I have to say this place has great food but have to agree with everyone else.  The service sucks.  Not sure if theres just not enough workers or theres a really high turnover in staff.  Maybe management is poor.  My wife went to pay with a credit card and got a different one back.   Of course she pointed it out and got hers back.  Sometimes if you get lucky it can be a very pleasurable experiance.  Dont know if we will try again.  Bummer."}
{"text":"Good service and the wait for a table is usually not that long. We usually get mussels and dinner salads which are a good sized portion and reasonable priced.  They also have a good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Pickle Barrel Cuisine: Canadian Location: Dundas Square Address: 312 Yonge St Price Range: $10-15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 2 Service: 3 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 2.5  This specific location I went with my family is located underground of Dundas Square. Personally I don't really like restaurants that are underground, it makes me feel as if I am trapped (yea I know I sound crazy but that's just me) They had lots of tables and huge booths, which would be good for family dinners or big group gathering. Personally I found the interior to be quite tacky, the whole green and turquoise blue theme didn't really do it for me.  Ordered: CALAMARI ($8.99) 2.5/5 This was def a big appetizer, but then again, it was $8.99 so you kind of expect that. There was some seasoning on top but I couldn't taste it and overall it was dripping in oil.  Plus I feel like 50% of what makes a good calamari dish is the sauce that comes with it. However, the sauce that came with this was just like mayo and didn't have much flavor. I usually like it to be a little spicy or tangy. I would not get this again.   Ordered: ROADSIDE SLIDERS ($8.99) 2/5 This dish had nice presentation to it, and it came with 4 burgers made sesame onion buns, beef patty and mushrooms. The condiments came on the side (ketchup,mustard,relish) which I thought was kind of weird. I feel like DIY concept at restaurants are becoming really popular and suppose to be hip (I doubt Pickle Barrel did it to be hip) but I find it annoying how I am paying for a meal and I have to do the work. The patty was super dry and there was this weird chinese vegetable inside the burger which did not taste good together. This was another fail.   Ordered: LOBSTER & SHRIMP PASTA ($15.99) 2/5 Even just looking back at the picture, I am disgusted by this 'pasta'. It's angel hair pasta so to some point it's understandable how the texture of the pasta should be softer, but this was just plain mush. The moment I put it in mouth, it broke into thousand pieces and I felt like I was eating baby food. Because it was so soft and overdone, it was hard to pick up the pasta in the first place cause it would break the moment my fork got to it. This had lots of carrot and zucchini on top and that def did not help the blandness of the dish. Garlic bread was just meh. Another fail!   Ordered: JUMBO CLUB HOUSE ($10.99) 2.5/5 I usually like sandwiches made with plain toast or chewy bread but this was made with Onion bread that was so hard and rough it was ripping the top of my mouth. It had the basic stuff inside like turkey, tomato, lettuc and bacon and came with side of fries. I didn't really understand why there was a little thingiemajig of mayo on the side, was I suppose to do work again and spread this into my sandwich? WHAT IS THAT? If I didn't want mayo in my sandwich, I would have asked the watress to remove it. If I didn't ask them to, why are you skipping one of the steps of making a sandwich? I just don't understand. The sandwich was very dry and had no flavor whatsoever. Coleslaw was basically chopping up veggies mixed in vinegar. I never had such a bad Club sandwich ever in my life.   Ordered: SPANISH PAELLA ($14.99) 3/5 My mom ordered this and this was the most decent dish of the meal.  It came with lots of seafood (~4 mussels and ~4 really big chubby shrimp) and spicy italian sausage. The Paella didn't taste very authentic (but what do we expect) and tasted too much of tomato paste but hey, at least tomato sauce makes almost everything taste good. Overall the paella was made too wet but I can't complain anymore.   Ordered: MOLTEN LAVA CAKE ($7.99) 2/5 The molten lava cake is juis just like what you would get from the frozen section of Walmart for 99cents. I swear I tried one of those before and the shape, texture and the taste is exactly the same.  Correct me if I am wrong, but I am assuming they basically microwave this 'cake' and throw in some whipped cream and cheap vanilla icecream on top and charge us $7.99. This is so not worth that!   Throughout the entire meal, the service was very attentive and the server was always there to refill our water and pop. Because the restaurant is so big and we were seated in a booth in the corner, it was really convenient for us to sit there for long period of time and just chit chat away.  Summary: This restaurant is a really bad version of Cheesecake Factory! I want to give it another chance but it's hard to give an excuse when I got to try one of their appetizer, plus 4 entree and a dessert. Food is bad, the price ain't cheap and there is no reason for me to go back to this place."}
{"text":"Was there for a late lunch today with three friends. Seat down and was served by this guy named \"oz\" (shown on receipt). First thing, \"hello\" we responded hello. Next thing he said was \"do you guys speak English?\" I was like wow. That totally threw me off the table. We are a group of minorities (mixed races) so you pull that \"joke\" on us because we didn't scream hello back at you?  We all work in the service industry we were like what is wrong with this guy? We already think he's very negative towards us. The vibe was really bad. I have been here a few times but this guy is terrible. U can imagine how the rest of the meal was after that. I should of said \"we don't speak English, u gonna bring us a translator or kick us out?\""}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel was once one of my favorite restaurants (6 years ago). But as I go back over the years I realize it has gone completely downhill. The staff and atomsphere has stayed the same, which is great and friendly. But the food is lacking. Their menu is about the size of a book which gives you a chance to pick out exactly what you're craving for but my food always seems dry, over cooked, and tasteless. The presentation is great but the food is lacking. I keep going back hoping for the same great food but I keep getting disappointed. They need a new head chef or something!"}
{"text":"Let's begin by saying that the layout is terrible. As others have said, you must walk down the escalator and then past the kitchen and service counters to get to the host stand. The service was equally as terrible, rude staff at the front and wait times when 50% of the tables were clear and clean.   Once we were sat, our server, who was unkempt, asked us what drinks we'd like to start with, and that was the only time he ever brought us water. He came to take the order while everyone was visibly unprepared to order, then disappeared for ten minutes. Three of us ordered different salads, we had a child who ordered a sandwich, and the last meal was paella. When the food arrived, the server handed on person at the table each dish to pass to the other people at the table. The salads were all large, fresh, and tasty. The paella, which the server was clearly never taught how to pronounce, was decent though under seasoned, and the rice was overcooked and limp. The kids meal came with a drink, which we then had to ask to be put into the children's cup, which it was supposed to come in. The server came back ten minutes later, dumped the cup on the table, asked \"Is that all?\" and walked away.  The meal ended with the server coming up to us, with half full salad plates, saying \"are you done?\" then turning to the next person and saying \"you done too?\" without an answer from either of us, removing the plates.  I don't plan on coming back here any time soon, and it's a shame that a restaurant I grew up with has turned into this."}
{"text":"This is probably not even a very good pickle barrel.   The underground location was depressing, for a pickle barrel.   The eggs were not so bad. I don't remember them, but that probably means that they weren't so bad.   That's not enough to make me give this barrel more than one star. I'm sorry, happy pickle man who carries around the tray of ice cream scoops. Although why should I be sorry for you when you are a cheap \"Mr. Peanut\" rip-off. Also, Mr pickle, you are the kind of drawing that gets really creepy and craggy looking close up. Like if you get to close to the king and queen in the subway, their faces are all melty."}
{"text":"Barrel of Pickles is a place I am brought to frequently for birthdays. People know that large groups can do well here without much of a wait at all. And so, Facebook messages and events are made all pointing towards the Pickle Barrel.   So really, it's not my fault that I have tried so many things on the menu! I've probably sampled at least one dish for each  chapter of their book-like menu. That is about 8 things. That is HUGE menu. From that, the odds are already stacked against them. How is possible that one kitchen can make 500 dishes, all amazingly?   My favourite of the dishes has been the steak fajita which I found to be delectable. So delectable that in fact I decided to try their chicken counterpart last night for a friend's birthday dinner. They were decent and very filling, yet missing some loving. The chicken was a bit dried out and had hard fat. The grated cheese seemed left out, oily and clumped together. All edible enough, just not that great. And that's how I've found most of the food. It always seems to have missed the mark somehow.   Service has also been meh. They don't do the free birthday slice of cake thang either! Mostly they just kind of mutter, \"Happy Birthday\" when the special day is mentioned. I've also encountered some painfully long waits for food with the waiter never checking in, no refills and bill paying problems.   I would like to say I wouldn't be gracing this establishment again but I really can't promise it. It's not really worth it."}
{"text":"The service here was very good, the ambiance just right since we were sitting in a booth in an alcove. Management was efficient and friendly.   The chocolate monster shake was amazingly delicious, and huge at 35 OZs.  The calamari was battered too heavily and deep fried to perdition, not so amazingly delicious.   Overall a good experience in a mall where there are really not that many good eating options."}
{"text":"Woodbridge prices... They charge more for their items. Service is 2nd best of PBs"}
{"text":"I had eaten at the location at Yonge and Eglinton.  It was way better there.  I ordered avocado egg rolls at both locations.  At the Dundas location they were less stuffed, over cooked and there was only two, instead of three.  2 egg rolls for $10?  Most of our food was pretty bad except for the hot brisket sandwich.  Even the fries were soggy."}
{"text":"I forgot about this place until a few friends wanted to come by.  We were they didn't take reservations and had to come by so we did and found there would be a 30 minute wait until we could get in.  We agreed and got one of those things that vibrate when a table was free.  We decided to wait and asked if there was a bar we could sit at.  They pointed us upstairs and off we went.  There was an awesome staff member that helped us make room and get us a few extra chairs so we could sit down which was fantastic but offset by the bartender who didn't get us a menu until 1 minute before our thing vibrated.  No, we did not get a table early, it was just that long until the bartender decided to get us a menu after acknowledging us a few times.  We all ordered some type of seafood dish.  I went with the paella.  The portion was large but I pretty much just ate the seafood out of it.  I find the dish really overcooked and didn't enjoy it that much.  The menu is huge though so there has to be something that someone might enjoy."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I have ever received.  We went in on a dead Wednesday night around 8:30-9:00 pm.  Waited about 5 minutes at the front door to be seated.  Then waited another 5-10 minutes for our waitress.  WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  The food was meh.    I've been to the Pickle Barrel in the Yorkdale Mall, which was WAY BETTER.  They are so unorganized, possibly understaffed, and the waitresses couldn't care less about you.  I would honestly pay the extra money, or wait to get into Milestones, Jackastors, or Joeys."}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel is one of the few places that has an extensive menu and can deliver on good food.  I suggested Pickle Barrel to my friends as they were indecisive on where to eat last night.  When we arrived, we were promptly greeted and there was a table ready for 4 right away.  The restaurant was packed on Sunday night.  Food  PB Famous Nachos - the dish really hit the spot, cheesy, tomatoy and crunchy.  The dish exceeded my expectations.  The SO really enjoyed them as well.  Killer Shake - this milkshake is meant for sharing.  You could go into a milkshake coma if you were to consume it by yourself.  It was really tasty, they used frozen yogurt instead of ice cream, so it is typically \"healthy\" for you.  My friends ordered pasta dishes and they really enjoyed their meals.  Service  Attentive and quick.  Our food came out within 10 minutes of ordering.  No complaints.  Overall, considering Pickle Barrel is a chain restaurant, this location deserves a 4 star for great service and good food.    I recommend Pickle Barrel if you are in the Sherway Gardens area."}
{"text":"We went her for my daughters 17th birthday. Told the waitress we were celebrating her birthday and nothing... Not even a happy birthday. My son asked about the difference between the child's spaghetti and the adult one. The waitress told us it was much , much bigger and you get two meatballs. The adult dish came out the exact same size as the child one but with two meatballs for double the price with no of the other kids benefits, our PB breakfast had a hair on the plate and the blue cheese burger had about 1/16 of a tsp on blue cheese on it.  Not going back!"}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel is usually a reliable spot to eat, never been blown away but haven't had any issues either. Maybe this was because I have always ordered their 'Famous Deli' sandwitch.   I decided to try something new today, and the Texas Style Steak Sandwich sounded awesome - and it was. I wasn't expecting a great quality steak for roughly $13 but it was delicious.  I'm impressed and I will be back."}
{"text":"We've been going here for a long time. Sad to say that this last experience was very disappointing. Everything from the slow service to the cheap napkins to the very bland food and select small menu let us to the point of not returning in the future. We will not be back. Take a look at the breakfast dish that came. This is what they consider to be there Belgian waffle worth $8.99. The French toast for kids did not taste anything like French toast and was completely deep-fried.We ended up having to pack up and leave without having her dishes cleared or getting the bill. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I usually find that my best experiences with restaurants are when it's a spontaneous visit, planned dates and outings and it's like there's some sort of notice that goes out to the restaurants to disappoint me.   My BF and I went to this Pickle Barrel on Thursday evening at about 4PM, not too early for dinner but we thankfully arrived before the dinnertime rush. We were seated promptly and our server was a very nice girl. I have to tell everyone - NEVER BE AFRAID TO GIVE YOUR SERVER A LOUD \"EXCUSE ME!\" TO GET THEIR ATTENTION. I'm usually a meek little thing, but when I go to a restaurant, I want service. Being meek or polite won't get you their attention, I saved my date from getting a drink he decided he didn't want but ordered. His massive milkshake thing was good, and so was his big meatball spaghetti. However I seem to always draw the short straw: I read \"Strawberry Smoothie\".....now what I FAILED to catch was \" blah blah made with yogurt.   Yogurt?!?!   What kind of a smoothie is made with yogurt?! I took one sip and made a face my bf had to comment on. It tasted like a nasty orange yogurt drink! I then whipped through the menu - everything usually made with milk was made with yogurt!!! I was completely let down as I saw sundaes and such delights ruined of their goodness by being made with yogurt. Chocolate sundae - yogurt. That's just WRONG!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wandered around Toronto and stumbled into this place on a super hot summer day, sweating, starving and dying of thirst. At first glance this seemed like a perfect option for late lunch with an expansive menu.   My husband ordered the burger with blue cheese, and I ordered nachos with ground beef. His burger was terrible - the patties were so tiny, about 3\" diameter and cooked to death. My nachos were also terrible - the ground beef was literally just a plain burger patty that they \"attempted\" to chop up and apply to the nachos, however you could tell it was formerly a burger and I had to break the meat apart myself. There was barely enough cheese and literally a huge scoop of sour cream (probably 3X the serving size) plopped on it. By the time I had eaten the chips with cheese on them, I still had a full plate full of naked chips without cheese.   The service was slow and our server uninterested. Overall a really crappy meal."}
{"text":"I visited with my friend because there were no other available restaurants at the time. Inside the restaurant, there were no servers to greet us. After about 10 minutes, one customer finished his beer to give his table to us. Then a server came out of nowhere to clean the table for us. It is still a mystery to me. I ordered the steak and fries, and my friend ordered nachos. It took slightly longer to get the dishes (25+ min), but I did not mind it. The steak was well-seasoned and cooked perfectly. The fries were alright. I ordered a pint of beer to go with it. The only issue I had was with the waiter. He asked us if we wanted to go for a second pint. I said \"No, I'm good,\" and he gave me another pint. I had to send it back, but he was not happy. He never made eye contacts with me afterward. Also, he came by only to see if we needed to order something. I felt that he was looking to increase our bill as opposed to letting us have a good time. The food was passable, but my overall experience does not justify a high rating. I do not wish to come back."}
{"text":"UPDATE -- Received a generic form letter, despite being in direct contact with the person who sent out the letter -- her name was on the bottom.  They tossed in a $25 gift card, which is nice, but also fairly thrifty considering the amounts I mentioned in my initial letter.  The downtown location is crap.  The customer support from head office is also crap.  However, the location at Yonge/Egglinton is awesome -- highly recommended."}
{"text":"Usually end up coming here when we are all too lazy to walk anywhere else, and well had tried every other restaurant on Younge Street. It's usually a safe default place to count on. We came here so many times, and have ordered numerous dishes. Most recently, we tried the alfredo pasta, pi muscles, penne pasta, chicken sandwich, and asian nachos. If I could recommend one thing for anyone to try it would be the asian nachos, definitely a must try. It's so delicious and flavourful. The other items were OK, but the alfredo pasta wasn't good, it was super oily (not buttery as it should be) and very under seasoned.  I always say I never want to come here again, but then I usually end up coming here once a year."}
{"text":"Came here with a few other people. The menu is absolutely massive which I found to be a bit of a turn off. None of the dishes looked particularly intriguing, very standard family diner fare. I had smoked salmon eggs benedict. One of my eggs was almost completely raw, had to be sent back and the potato latkes were extremely bland. The other food at the table didn't look much better except the salad looked decent. Definitely would not recommend!"}
{"text":"Ok. I was looking for a good place to have a good meal. I wanted a place that had everyday meals. Not super fancy, over the top food. The reviews were not so good. But I gave it a go. I'm glad I did. I had soup and a beef brisket sandwich with gravy and poutine fries. My first time for the fries. It was really good. The soup came out piping hot, as soup should be. Not warm. I'm a slow eater and I enjoy my food. I asked the waiter to not rush the second course which is usually futile but I was able to finish my soup and a minute later out came the sandwich and fries. Nice and hot. Two thumbs up. When I first arrived I was seated right away. After going through the rather large menu I made my choices. The waiter was right there. Other staffers also checked on me. They were all friendly. Over all a great experience. Kudos to the Vaughan Pickle Barrel. Good stuff.  M. L. From New York. USA."}
{"text":"-Lost their quality when it comes to the pei mussels.  Smaller in size and they don't serve it with bread anymore.  -Rasberry lemonade cocktail too sweet and no taste of alcohol in it and the Pinacolada was too frozen. -The peppers in my fajita had their price sticker still on! Very unsatisfactory experience."}
{"text":"I generally try to avoid this place, but when a friend you haven't seen in years suggests the Pickle Barrel for dinner, it's rude to say, \"No\".  I guess I could have tried, \"No, thanks!\" but that doesn't come naturally.  I was actually glad I tried this place again.  There was a short wait for a table, which gave us just enough time to run an errand just outside of the restaurant before we were buzzed.    It was Mojito night so I ordered one.  For $5.99 you get a gigantic beverage, but it was pretty watery.  I chose the miso salmon burger with couscous.  The salmon and couscous were fantastic, the bun needs improvement.  Two thumbs up for the side of wasabi mayo.    We noticed the desserts in the display case on the way in and requested one of them.  Our kind waiter brought us a tray of six different mini desserts.  I had a perfectly-sized (this means tiny) tiramisu and my friend had a rich chocolate dessert.  I appreciated that it was only $2.99 and while I imagine it would be too small for most, it was the perfect finale to my meal."}
{"text":"\"A Jack of All Trades, but a Master of None\" is the perfect figure of speech to describe the the Pickle Barrel at Young and Dundas.  The first thing that you notice when sitting down is that the menu is roughly 10 pages long and they have nearly every type of eats from thai and chinese, to all day breakfasts and seafood, not to mention Rose Reisman's healthy choices (which are undoubtedly the best picks on the menu, albeit slightly more pricey, and are excluded from a lot of the bashing the rest of the establishment is about to take from me).  The large selection is about the only good thing about this particular restaurant. Which isn't especially saying much since the large selection comes with the large prices, with most entrees looking to put you back $15-30.  The service... I don't even know why they bother hiring the \"hostess\" (VERY loosely used term) upstairs because she's obviously there for show. The last two times I've entered through the upstairs entrance I had to wait for the hostesses (these were two different people by the way) to finish texting before telling me to walk downstairs and through the restaurant in order to have the downstairs hostess put my party on a list for a table. I can deal with that, just enter through the downstairs entrance through the Atrium, better service.  Once in the basement though, which is sort of drab, dreary and just uncomfortable as fine dining atmospheres go, all the waiters I've had have been excellent.  Now the food... All I can say is mediocre at best. Their calamari is decent as a large appetizer. Yet beware, their batter is incredibly rich and takes on a lot of oil (over-fried) so expect to feel some bloating.  I personally had their eggs benedict today which was horrendous. If you want a benedict, go somewhere else (yes, even Golden Griddle who had a surprisingly good benedict last time I dropped by). Eggs were overcooked and didn't seem like they were freshly made, the bacon was obviously heatlamped, and the english muffin tasted stale. The only good point of the breakfast was the potato latke which was nothing like a latke and was more like a hashbrown, yet it tasted good, albeit a little salty.   In the past I've had their a few of their steak and pasta items. I'd highly advise against the steak (dry, overcooked, tasteless), though the pasta is definitely passable.  I saved the best for last. The dessert. I'd personally recommend the Killer Milkshake at $4. It's massive. You'll probably be able to find a better milkshake in town, but not one that size, and not one for that price. I know a lot of my friends love their brownies and cake, I haven't tried them though so YMMV.  In closing, Pickle Barrels isn't a place I'd particularly recommend to go. It definitely has the menu, but the food ruins it by being mediocre. There are so many better eats for better prices in the area."}
{"text":"The server was missing for awhile.... The steaks were either under or overcooked.... The waiter kept trying to convince us that the blue cheese was ranch (give me a break)  Just stay away if you're not interested in wasting your money"}
{"text":"A friend and I came in on a steady Tuesday, right about noon. Not too busy but not extremely dead.  Service: our server was really nice but not very attentive. Felt like she could have really benefited from having other staff help her bus her tables.  Food: They have cut down their menu a lot since the last time I've been to a PB but it's still the /meh/ quality. I had a matzo ball soup and a lobster grilled cheese. I expected way better flavour from something with lobster in it. My friend and I ordered deserts and unless it's a cheesecake it's going to be disgusting. She had this oreo sundae type thing but really it was JUST whipped cream, chocolate sauce and 3 oreos. I had the tiramisu and it was a heap of whipped cream, 3 strawberry slices (that were definitely past their prime) and bitter lady fingers. Oh and it had this weird mushy crumbly stuff which I can only assume was disintegrated lady finger.  Layout: We came from Yonge street and when you walk in you're at the bar. There's these escalators but we had no idea cause we've never been here before. We looked to the bar tender for some sort of visual que and nothing so we had to go down the escalator and wondered for a bit before meeting a host.  All in all, you can probably pass on going here."}
{"text":"To start I only out one star because giving them no stars wasn't an option.  To start our evening we were seated and then it took 25 minutes for anyone to even notice we were there.  Then we ordered, the food did come quickly BUT it was horrible. One of the dishes we ordered we couldn't get because they didn't have a sauce that goes with it.  We ordered something else and on that dish their was a huge hair, so disgusting.  They tried fixing it and brought us dessert but the dessert was just as bad. It was the mini desserts and They gave us the ones from the display so they were not good at all.  This is the second time we ate here and both times we had a horrible experience and we will never be back again.  My husband and I are chefs so we no when things aren't right, and the food was not ok at all..  I will never ever come back to the pickle barrel in my life. EDIT: they tried charging us for things we didn't eat or drink.  I want to leave..."}
{"text":"Just finished eating at this location,  and what can I say other than it is ridiculously overpriced for the tiny meals that they provide. My gf just had the surf and turf, and had the salad replaced with a soup which was normally $5 (matzo ball). When the soup arrived I could not believe my eyes. It was a single matzo ball in a tiny soup bowl. Something you would normally put ice cream in. Then the meals arrived and they were simply mediocre. They put down the main meal without clearing the dirty soup bowls.  Spent $ 75 including tip and went home unsatisfied."}
{"text":"The grab and go section is the best! Sandwiches are great and the service is good. I like that they grill the sanwiches - so yummy!   The sit in service is bad.. unsure of why. Servers have attitude. I recommend the grab&go!! :)"}
{"text":"While shopping at Vaughan mills this evening I decided to stop at pickle barrel for dinner. Upon waiting for the hostesses to finish their conversation to request a table; I was a witness to them dropping at least 3 (loud) f bombs while being ignored. So not welcoming when entering a restaurant. If I had children I would've walked right away.   Anyway, to the meal; I ordered the fish tacos (which were just okay), and the super berry kale salad, which was phenomenal! One of the best salads I've ever had. I also had the blueberry lemonade safe drink. It was great too. I am writing this review while waiting for my sever to take my dessert order, it's been awhile so for efficiency I decided to write now.   The restaurant seems very dead and overstaffed, and the people working don't seem to care about quality service.   I really think this restaurant could use a manager on site (if there isn't one here now, I hope not). Operationally speaking it seems as though almost everyone here isn't concerned with the guests experience. The bus boy just cleared the table beside me, and took all of the half full glasses and poured the liquid into a bin and left the bin inches away from me on the booth seat. This was the most unappetizing thing I've ever experienced in a restaurant. I had to ask him to move it and blame it on me having a weak stomach... I mean I didn't want to be rude, but ANYONE would be grossed out by that.   There are definitely some changes that need to be made to bring and keep the type of crowd that pickle barrel appears to attract. If this was a small run down dive, service and behaviour above wouldn't be so alarming.   Food was 4* service and overall experience 1*... disappointed as I've been to pickle barrel Sherway gardens and had amazing service there every time."}
{"text":"Very small portions making every dish overpriced. You can add more, like extra meat, for a fee which makes it the same price a other places for the same size sandwich's.  Very annoying up selling on EVERYTHING, I mean who wants a side of chicken on tuna poke.....WTF.  So go here if you want to pay more for less or pay extra to get regular portions and badgered."}
{"text":"Had the today, was my first time and the food was really good...the price wasn't too bad....the problem...  Well the place wasn't busy at all, yet it took more than 10-15 mins to get seated. Thank god I was hungry.  By the time I was seated I had passed at least 2 tables with leftover food on them, sat down and saw a table on the left and behind me that were also covered in leftover meals.....it was disgusting.  I mean come on it wasn't cleaned til my meal was actually almost done and it definitely wasn't busy...I watched staff just walk by the tables...at one point a waitress put down a tray of dirty glasses on one of the nasty tables and walk over to the bar....too heavy to carry over I guess.  (Speaking caveman style) ----food good, place dirty"}
{"text":"I like this Pickle Barrel.  Went there with my wife, three friends and two kids.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  The servers were friendly and helpful.  I ordered the steak and eggs with latkes.  I was pleasantly surprised with my steak. It was flavourful, juicy and cooked just like I wanted it.  The steak had no unwanted tough grissel.  The latkes were tasty and cooked nicely.  Eggs were nice too. My wife had eggs, sausage and toast and liked her meal too. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"6, I killed 6 fruit flies during my visit here. I was absolutely grossed out by it.  everything was fine when we were seated, but then we placed our order, which included mimosas and shortly after those were brought the fruit flies started appearing.   as I started looking around the restaurant I noticed people were swatting around their arm as they ate so it wasn't only me who experienced this.  we asked if this was a known issue and the server said he didn't see a single one! I had to swat one to the table to show him, maybe I should have started a collection?   anyhow, our food came out and we finished it as quickly as we could to leave.   super disappointed with the reaction I got from the server - I'd rather eat fast food than have to swat flies at a restaurant.   and funny enough - the review below mine is also complaining about fruit flies in their drink."}
{"text":"While roaming the streets of Toronto and shopping with my hubby we worked up a bit of an appetite and decided to step into this place as it appeared small with a bar and we sat at the bar and was taken down the escalator after inquiring about a table. Once down the place was pretty sizable and plenty of people enjoying what appeared to be GOOD FOOD. We started on the menu and it was so extensive that it reminded me of the confusion of making a decision while eating at the Cheesecake Factory with their extensive menu.  Our server was Blah which didn't help with making decisions so that was a quick star off (Every spot start with  stars) We ended up with a couple of small plates Calamari, mini Lobster Tacos and Lobster & Jumbo shrimp pasta. Our food wasn't the BEST in flavor, the best item was the Lobster Tacos. The calamari was not fried well so it wasn't crispy enough which we sent back and it was fried properly and the pasta was not good at all those two things took off another star.  The restaurant survived and kept three stars because the manager was pregnant and sweet and I was pregnant as well and we bonded while I was speaking to her about the things that we were not pleased with. She gave us dessert which was good it was mini cakes in cups. I would recommend people try this place and try other items as the items we tried may not be the best items to have there and they may have better items so we will try again next time in town."}
{"text":"Nice place to go with a family. Kinda like the Canadian Cheesecake Factory but you can taste the freshness of Canadian vegetables compared to the ones in the U.S. But the overall quality is average. Great place to spend time with a bunch of people"}
{"text":"Bad place, the server took the table who came after us and she didn't bother to ask us whether we were served or not and  even after that when she came to take our order she dint even smile or greet us. God knows what was wrong with her. I hope she dint spit in my food."}
{"text":"All day breakfast means I can go to the PB for waffles and ice cream any hour of the day. Delicious and fresh, AND close to Ryerson Uni, the Eaton Center and all the festivities around Yonge Dundas Square.  Good service (my water was constantly refilled), fun drink specials (pina coladas on Monday) and typical but cool PB atmosphere Great place to stop for a quick bite if you're in the Yonge Dundas area"}
{"text":"I would never go back here.. For starters, the menu is ridiculous, and I think this largely contributed to our awful dining experience. I don't know if our waiter was new or what, but she didn't seem to have answers to any of our questions about the menu, and came back at least three times to tell us we had to order something different because things were unavailable.  Plus, she was soooo slow, we waited forever to order and for things to come, even though the place was pretty dead.  The food was nothing special, my mozzarella sticks were okay, but that's pretty hard to mess up. My family was unimpressed with the Tex-Mex spring rolls, and the nacho platter we had was alright. For the main dishes, everyone seemed to like parts of their meals, but no one was really wow'd.  The dessert menu seemed pretty good, but for some reason all the desserts are listed as coming with yogurt, which seemed super weird. Thankfully, it's just a poorly written menu, it's FROZEN vanilla yogurt, pretty much ice cream, not sure why no one caught that during proofreading? I guess after proofing the rest of their mammoth menu they were just getting tired by the end..  The seating is nice, and the decor is classy, but other than that I was really unimpressed."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Service is horrid. Food is awesome (2nd star for food only). \"Parking Validation\" is a lie.   Arrived at 4pm on a Saturday to a 10% full restaurant. We were not acknowledged for a full 15 minutes. Finally a waiter beckoned us over. I say beckoned because he called us over like dogs with a hand gesture and didn't say a word when we got there. He sat us at a back booth and handed us menus before leaving, coming back 5 minutes later to take our orders. We mentioned that we saw that they validated parking and asked how it worked. He told us that we could go downstairs after our meal and show our receipt and \"the ladies\" will take care of it.  We ordered two water and an appetizer between us, just looking for a nice light meal and a sit down while shopping. The moment we ordered an app between us, our server became even more uninterested and partially rude to us. It took another hour before our food came out or our waters were filled (despite being empty for a long time).   Don't get me wrong, the food was great and plentiful. We had the Hoisin chicken lettuce wraps. It was perfect for an afternoon lunch after a big brunch that morning. After we were 3/4 done, our server came back around and asked if we would like dessert. I turned to my partner and asked if she would, and she told me that she was thinking about it. He left abruptly before she even had a chance to respond. We decided that we were done with this and the next time around when he asked for the cheque we just wanted to leave. It took him an absurd amount of time to get the cheque, and when he returned I immediately placed a bill in it and set it aside. It took him another 15 minutes to come back and he started digging change out right there. Pulled out his coin purse and started zipping it open and closed a few times slowly, clearly trying to delay us. He eventually paid us in all coins (not a huge issue, but our change was at least one bills worth in addition to some coinage) and left with a very unconvincing \"nice to meet you\" as he was already walking away.    Now for the parking \"validation\":  We went down stairs as instructed and asked for parking validation and for clarification on how it worked. \"Do we have to use this within the next little while, like do we need to leave now, or can we keep doing things and leave later?\"  The woman at the till was uncertain, said \"I think it's good until six o'clock,\" and asked another employee for clarification.  \"Oh, don't worry, it's free after six,\" she said. The time was around 5:25pm.  We asked for clarification, \"So, can we leave now? Do we have to wait until six?\"  Neither of them knew, and repeated \"it's free after six\" like a catchphrase. In the end we were assured that we could leave whenever, and left with the understanding that parking in the garage was free after six o'clock regardless of validation, and the validation was good to use anytime we left. We stayed until after 6 (despite being done our shopping) so we were sure that the parking was free, getting back to our car around 6:03.  The machine told us to pay $7.50. Confused, we caught the attention of one of the idle security officers, who called a parking attendant for us. The attendant explained that the validation is only valid for time spent in the lot after 6pm. So any time we spent prior to that was being charged. We explained that nobody at the restaurant had a proper understanding of the issue and that nether they nor The Atrium's website clarified that.   As I pulled out my wallet to pay, a security officer approached and brusquely demanded to know what was wrong with our ticket machine. I told him there had been a misunderstanding about parking validation with the Pickle Barrel. Clearly annoyed and upset, he rudely shouted at us to just get it over with. We paid and drove away."}
{"text":"Have eaten at this location upwards of a dozen times over the years.  Local chain with tons of tables & booths, so room for a lot of people.  You can enter from the Yonge St side where there's a bar and escalator that brings you downstairs.  Or you can enter from inside the Atrium 'mall' on the lower level, where they have a take-out section and dessert display case.  Cute, semi-modern decor with a lot of blue touches, and very nice bathrooms.  The menu is gigantic and has something to please anyone.  On my most recent visit I tried the Eggs Benny with spinach and tomato, with latkes.  It was standard/good and I'd get again.  My favorite thing about having lunch or dinner here though is the selection of fun frozen drinks.  Although it's not one of my favorite places in the city, I'd go any time someone wanted to, due to the variety of menu options (never get bored with so much to try)."}
{"text":"A few friends and I came here on a Friday night as the other restaurant we wanted had too long of a wait. I kinda wish we waited for the other place instead :( Service was friendly but also a bit weird since we had two servers in the beginning because they weren't sure whose table it was. Then they kinda left us to work it out between them so we had to wait a while before they took our orders.....they were nice though, but I was hungry. The food.. was really disappointing. I had the seafood paella, and it was super bland. The chicken in it was also super dry. I was really disappointed since I had ordered it at the pickle barrel in Markham and it was good. My friend ordered this as well and we both poured about half the chilli flakes bottle into our dishes because it was that bland. I did like my blueberry lemonade cocktail though, and my other friend enjoyed her seafood linguine! But, given the amount of choices in this area, I really don't see myself coming back unfortunately."}
{"text":"The service is good but the food doesn't live up to expectations, it's kind of meh to me to be honest."}
{"text":"Birthday party because Pickle Barrel seems to have that theme. Kids or drunk Ryerson students, the Pickle Barrel has you covered. The menu shows a kids section that is outstanding. Everything in for under $10 which seemed like it's a better deal than McDonalds. This Pickle Barrel has an escalator which makes for an anything-can-happen high risk unsupervised play structure or powered exercise treadmill. The kids meals were adult size too. Served in oversized white china, the portions were way more than any kid could normally eat providing impromptu leftovers for any adults lingering around so keep that in mind. The appetizers were good: The calamari was a nice surprise. Perfectly cooked and tender with slices of grilled peppers (roast pepper aioli, spiced tomatillo sauce 10.99) avocado egg rolls (sundried tomatoes, onion, cilantro, honey tamarind dip 9.99) and there was a nondescript mini taco plate as well. Drink specials were offered - good and the service was quick and perfectly timed. Effective synergy happening here and no complaints all around."}
{"text":"Bon spot pour se reposer de la frénésie de Dundas Square entre 2 sessions de shopping intense au Eaton Centre. Service rapide et efficace, grand choix de bière et restauration de pub classique."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!! Excellence services, great variety of food. I love the decor and ambience. My husband order the frittata for breakfast and I order the Avocado Toast and they're  delicious . We willl definitely come back for Dinner or Lunch."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite location but I recently had a terrible experience that probably means I won't return. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and it came doused in Parmesan cheese. I've never seen that before anywhere and certainly not at the Pickle Barrel.  And my Caesar salad was also covered in Parmesan which I suppose is more traditional but it made it almost inedible. To top it off, the service was very slow (but friendly) and it wasn't particularly busy on the night I dined there."}
{"text":"This Pickle Barrel really needs to up their service level.  Came here for a work function and we asked the waitress to take a picture of us on a cell phone. The waitress did so in a heartbeat but her manager walking by made a snarky remark \"are you going to stand there taking pictures all day or serve the customers?\" We were all mortified and felt horrible for getting the waitress in trouble.  On another occasion a coworker and I came in to look at cakes and found no one to help us. Finally an employee on her break came by the counter and didn't look happy we asked her for help. She told us no one works this counter and to go to the takeout counter to get help. She eventually went to find a manager to answer our question about nut allergies."}
{"text":"Great greasy spoon breakfast!  If you're craving a cheap hotdog or burger with all the fixins, look no further.  I enjoy the food here, and it's super cheap.  You can't really go wrong.  I'm not a fan of the chilli fries.. but that's just me"}
{"text":"I have been to Pickle Barrel a few times and usually stick to things like burgers and sandwiches. I decided to switch it up this time and order a \"Tex Mex chicken salad\". The salad arrived and for the most part matched the menu description except for the dressing. What was supposed to be \"lime cilantro\" tasted exactly like pancake syrup.   The further I got into the salad, the more sugary syrup sauce there was. I was confused by what was going on with this salad. I would have asked our server but she never really came around. The other food ordered at the table was good enough. I was the only one that got burned ordering the sugar salad, weird."}
{"text":"Services was whack and slow. Sitting at the bar and both bar tenders were chatting it up with these 2 customers sitting by the window. Ok hi what about the rest of customers?"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service.  Eggs Benedict was good. Atmosphere very nice. I would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I had my dinner meal with my family here. I ordered Fish&Chips for myself. And I also tried their steak. The Fish & Chips was OK. But the steak was super-delicious. The total for a dinner for 4 was nearly $180. If you visit any Pickle Barrel, remember to buy a giant milkshake for just 3 bucks"}
{"text":"This visit just doesn't measure up to what I've come to expect from Pickle Barrel.  We came here this weekend for dinner. Granted, it was busy, but the service was slow. We were seated in one of the booths by the front, the high walls made it intimate, quiet and hidden. So hidden in fact that it took our waitress over 30 minutes to stop by before taking our drink orders.   We shared the 1lb beef tenderloin fajitas. The beef was dry, the rice was clumpy and the lettuce was limp. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. This is surprising given the fact that I was starving and anything would have been delicious by then.   I ordered the strawberry killer shake. It's massive, it comes in a 32oz mug topped with whip cream. I highly recommend it. It's available at every Pickle Barrel location and comes in vanilla, strawberry, chocolate or banana.   While I will not stop going to Pickle Barrel (I've had some very great experiences), I probably won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Got a table from the hostess, and then waited 20 minutes before leaving. No waiter came to offer drinks or take any orders.  Don't waste your time, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Never been to a Pickle Barrel before but after an afternoon of scouring the shops at Vaughan Mills Shopping Center my friend and I had worked up an appetite and low and behold... in the distance was... Pickle Barrel!  It wasn't too busy for a Tuesday evening and we were seated right away in a nice secluded booth. The walls of the booth enclosed you as if you were in your own intimate room for two.   We started off with a pint of beer and appetizer of... Fried Pickles! Of course right?  They were amazing! Perfectly breaded and crispy on the outside and juicy and \"pickle-y\" on the inside.   For our main meal we decided to order the one pound order of fajitas with half medium rare steak and half chicken breast! YUM!  No complaints and they were very generous on the extra sides for us to share!   I am definitely a fan and will go again!"}
{"text":"Awesome steak sandwich.  Happy cheerful staff Steak sandwich was very filling and the service was prompt. Drinks are reasonably priced.  I highly recommend you visit this restaurant while visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"We enjoy every pickle barrel so this review is specific to this one. The atmosphere is beautiful as this is one of the newer ones. The food never disappoints especially if you want to eat healthy.  Would give it a 5 star but this location likes to use students for service compared to the other locations that use full time mature help."}
{"text":"EDIT: Got to love their \"response\" to me - if she actually READ the review, I did follow-up at the time of this incident.  They suck.  This review is a LONG time coming.  I kept trying to write it, but I'd get more and more upset.  I think I'm ready to write this one...  Last year, my best friend and I decided to go to Pickle Barrel.  Deep down inside, we knew better.  But I had this odd craving for one of their giant, awful bellini-type drinks, so we went.  We were seated in a booth and as we slid in, my friend went, \"Uh oh,\" and then showed me her hand, which was BLEEDING.  Yes.  Blood. coming from her hand because...there was broken glass all over the booth seats and table we were just sat at.    Horrified, we notified the hostess, who was like, \"Oh, they just broke a glass at this table, I guess I can move you hold on.\"  WHAT?? YOU SAT US AT A TABLE WITH BROKEN GLASS? And now my friend was bleeding, and you offered us THAT as an explanation, no band aid, not even giving two effs?  We then got moved, eventually, to another table, where we got ignored for at least twenty minutes.  It was obvious to me our new server had no idea what had just happened.  We got nothing comped.  We got no manager visit our table.  Basically, we got sat on glass, and then tossed out with the trash.  After our meal, I was fuming.  I asked to speak to a manager, and I explained the situation.  She SHOULD have refunded our entire meal.  Instead, she said, \"Well, you can come back and we will make your experience better next time.\"  whatever the hell that means.  She then asked me for my name and phone number.  She went up to a daytime calendar book, and went back many months in it.  On a random day, in October, she just wrote my name and phone number.  No information.  No idea how I was ever supposed to relay this information to anyone?  \"Uhm, my name is randomly written on a day in another month in another year in some book?\"  This is not a real system of making things right.  Pickle Barrel should just be ashamed of themselves.  They owed us so much more."}
{"text":"Food is to Pickle Barrel's standards but \"SERVICE\" can ruin everything!   I recently went on Sunday, July 4th which was Toronto Pride weekend.  We decided to take my girlfriend's cousin from Ohio (his 19th birthday...legal in Ontario) for a nice treat on us.  He was buzz, since we've been partying on the street.  We weren't able to get service frequently and the waiter took forever on our glasses of water.  I understand they're busy but their level of service isn't acceptable.  They need to put more staff on events like this.  Her cousin was applaud, since American service is apparently set really high.      We ordered a full rack of ribs, jambalaya pasta, 8oz steak, nachos, and alcoholic beverages.  Food was delicious and no complaints.     The biggest problem was trying to pay the bill for a good 15 minutes.  Her cousin kept insisting on skipping the bill but being Canadians, we didn't.  We had to ask for a manager and complaint about the wait time.  They gave us 25% off and the waiter came to apologize which was too late.  Even though, we got our discount we're wholly disappointed."}
{"text":"I love pickles, I had no idea what this restaurant was about when I walked by it but I didn't care. I had to eat here strictly because of the name. I am sooo glad I did because i was not disappointed.  There are 2 entrances. We came in from the street and thought it was just a small restaurant and bar until we got in and saw there was a downstairs where we could also eat. My husband I decided that we would eat downstairs and made our way to the hostess stand. We were told the wait was about 10 minutes so we put our names in and waited. ti took just about 10 minutes before we were called to our table. The decor in the restaurant is really nice and cool. We loved being in there and looking at the restaurant during our wait. When we were brought to our table our waitress came promptly to take drink orders and brought our drinks also very promptly. She also told us a little about the menu and gave us time to think it over. You can tell she is a skilled waitress because she gave us just the right amount of time to figure out what we wanted before she took our orders.  You can get most breakfast items all day so my husband was super excited. He ordered waffles with strawberries and frozen yogurt on the side. He kept raving about his waffles so I had to take a couple of bites... He was right, they were amazing. It was like having candy they were so good, no syrup was necessary because the waffle were just that good.  It was so good later that week I made some waffles with frozen yogurt for dinner.  I ordered the P.B. Burger which had bacon, cheese and an onion ring on it. The burger was cooked to perfection and I could take everything at once. I am not sure what the bun was but it was also very good. I don't order burgers very often but boy was I glad that I ordered that burger. It was sooo tasty I am drooling thinking about it right now. It came with french fries that were fried to perfection. Throughout our entire meal we had really great service. Our waitress was attentive to all of our needs and sometimes before we even realized we had the need. The great food and great service was amazing. If my husband and I lived in the area, we would eat here often. I was very happy with everything and the price was very reasonable if not on the cheaper side for what we thought we would pay at a restaurant that looks so nice. I highly suggest trying it here."}
{"text":"Came here for a Deli Platter. O my god its alot of smoked meat!!!! No healthy Heather Reisman choices for me! All Deli, all the time. The meat is okay, and the servers have to be reminded to bring more slices of bread (they only bring 4 to start with), but its a decent deal and decent Deli (no Caplansky's though) I'll eventually have to try something else on the menu, but for now I'm not complaining.  In terms of service and ambiance, the Pickle Barrell is just okay.. The service is spotty, last time I was served by a very large man, who would seem more at home as one of those scary personal trainers at Goodlife (maybe this is his sideline?)  The decor and feel of the resteraunt are that of a chain, all beiges and soft lighning, but this place is Bubi and Zaidi (Grandparents in Yiddish), in fact its my Yaid's favourite place in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night for drinks! The drinks were great! Perfectly crafted! Adult root beer! Butterscotch drink to die for! Why the 3 stars? The Pickle barrel was out of pickles :|  not cool! Other then that, staff wasn't terrible for a Sunday night, clean place, very nice decor! But u can't call ur self the (empty) Pickle barrel!"}
{"text":"I normally try to find the pros more than the cons, but this experience at this location definitely makes me cringe. I'm going to be focusing on the service and food.  A friend and I waited at the reception to be seated, we waited at least 10-15 minutes until we were seated, and it definitely was NOT busy when we were walking to our table after FINALLY having a server seat us. When we sat down, we requested for a more comforter seating area, because the table and chairs were wobbly and the table was too small. She immediately declined. When deciding what to order, the server seemed very impatient and rushed me on what to order. The server just really did not seem happy and I definitely felt that vibe from her. I'd rate this 1/5  Okay, now the food. I really like Pickle Barrel, I've been to other locations and I haven't been disappointed, but this time, it was so gross, I don't think I can think to go back. I ordered a tomato and sausage pasta, and my friend ordered nachos. My pasta somehow came before her nachos and my plate honestly looked like someone already ate half of it. The sauce as all over the plate, the fork and spoon was just tossed in, and it just tasted like cold bland tomato soup. There was barely any pasta or sausage at all. Secondly, my friend's nachos came with no chicken and unmelted cheese after she order it with chicken. So they brought it back inside. The second time, the cheese was not melted at all AGAIN, so all she ate was cold cheese, cold chips, and cold white raw looking processed chicken. We brought the concern to the server and she brushed it off, saying that's the way Pickle Barrel makes it. I didn't know nachos came with cold toppings and cheese that isn't melted? I'd rate this 0/5  Overall, if you are wanting Pickle Barrel, please, please go to another location. This was just atrocious and the food was absolutely disgusting! Service was horrendous. DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"The Pickle Barrel has something for everyone. Lots of menu choices and healthy options. Doesn't offer a wide drinks menu but it covers the basics. Always friendly service. Today Anna recommended the sirloin in wild mushroom sauce with root vegetable mash and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Third visit. Terrible service. Waitress argued about potatoes not being included with eggs Benny.  Asked for no cranberries in my salad, got the cranberries and not the grape tomatoes. Green monster smoothie was so sweet it was undrinkable. The waitress was miserable. The wait for food was too long.  It's a shame that this place can't get its 'stuff' together because the menu has a great variety of delicious dishes. Service lacks. Although they comped the salad and the green monster and split the bill by 50% we probably won't go back and you should save your time and money. Go somewhere else. I'd rather pay my entire bill for great food AND service. Please Nancy no need to remark the usual you are sorry and will send feedback to management. At this point the problems should have been fixed."}
{"text":"This is your typical Pickle Barrel. It's large, has a large menu, and it's a tad chaotic (which can result in slow service). If you need to be somewhere, let them know and they'll make sure you're taken care of in time.  Pro tip: If you make a reservation or want to be seated from the dining room, you need to enter via the lower level or you can walk in from the Yonge St entrance, down the escalator, and to the opposite side of the restaurant. Bit of a design flaw there."}
{"text":"This is the Pickle Barrel. The menu is extensive, but the staff are friendly enough and like you to leave happy.  I have always found the food here to be of good quality and service to be sufficient. I wouldn't recommend being in a huge rush to get out of there, though.  This place is perfect for any group of collection of people who have extremely varied tastes in both the food and drink department. There will be something for everyone (it just might take a while to find it)"}
{"text":"Food is okay but worst customer service ever, especially the waitresses. They're always frowning and yelling at you and so unprofessional"}
{"text":"Not much in this world comes close to being better than this places Steak Frites Salad. If you have a chance, bring a friend and order this. The serving size is huge and it's phenomenally delicious all the way through. Who know, for round two with this salad you might want to get it all to yourself!  This Pickle Barrel in particular is very clean, very posh, and a really romantic venue for a nice date. My ex-girlfriend and I both loved frequenting this place every year for our anniversary.  The service has consistently been outstanding. Always super friendly and super considerate. When the waiters have something to do for you it gets done right away and with a smile. I couldn't have picked many other pleasant spots to bring my ex for our anniversary's which is why we stuck with this joint.  But what am I going to do now that we broke up!? I need a date to go get some steak frites with! (Now accepting applications :P)"}
{"text":"Please stay away from this place.  Don't waste your time or money.  My husband and I stopped in to get a bite while shopping.  Let me Give you the condensed version:  CON:We (along with 2 other families) waited about 7 min for a hostess to come to the entrance.  A waiter finally came to the door and seated us. Hubby got a beer glass with lipstick stain. Patio had a wet and dirty seat cushion dripping over in the corner of patio...with a catch basin underneath it!   Not to mention the fly infestation!  Never seen anything like it in my life.  My food came cold so I had to return it.  Waiter couldn't care less about any of our issues.  Floor was dirty all over the restaurant.   PRO:Complained to manager who was nice about it.    Although we were given comp deserts, this place totally disgusts me. I actually was grossed out."}
{"text":"I joined some friends for dinner on a Friday night here. We got seated at a table which was a bit dirty. The chairs had crumbs on it and the floor had dirty napkins laying around. Not the most pleasant area to sit in. I ordered the strawberry milkshake which was topped with a piece of red velvet cake ($10.99). It was actually pretty good, the cake was great. Low rating for cleanliness and the service wasn't great either. The food that my friends ordered looked pretty good though. That would be a plus for this location."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular about this Pickle Barrel.  The food was OK, nothing great. The lobster/spinach dip was \"watery\" for my taste, Red Lobster's so much better; the BBQ pork ribs in spite of tasting good were not tender and falling off the bone, they were waaay over roasted. I've had better ribs on Swiss Chalet.  Service was acceptable. Lots of time waiting for the waitress to get our order, get the bill... probably not her fault, but anyway, it kinda sucked.  With many other better options around... it was probably our first and last time at this location."}
{"text":"My friend and me almost die front the door  at -40 !  Because they had the doors closed and on sunday at 10 pm when they close at 11!! We came from the condos ( 10 minutes walking) and they had close the doors apparently to don't let the people go in and finish their work soon!! I this it is really disappointing for a important restaurant like it  is. This is the second bad experience. Because also they offer kids eat free on sundays after 2 and with my kids the waitress include in the bill their lunches and said that offer dont include what they order ( something in the kids menu) after paid we complain with the manager y she said that wasn't true! And she gave us. The money back"}
{"text":"I go for the bruschetta. Every time I have had it the tomatoes have been so fresh and juicy. The grilled bread and feta that accompany the red beauties have never let me down either.   Not a huge fan when it comes to the actual main course, but the bruschetta has not led me astray yet."}
{"text":"I know a lot of people hate on this place, but i actually am obsessed with pickle barrel. I LOVE how the menu is the size of a novel and really there's always going to be something for everyone to eat.  I've legit tried most of the things on their menu but the menu is always changing.  It's just a casual consistent restaurant if you aren't looking for anything fancy.  You obviously don't come here and order steak or seafood expecting it to blow your mind.  to me, it's like toronto's sad version of  the cheesecake factory :)  there's all day breakfast on the menu.  like really u can't go wrong there. i'm always down for their omelettes. the crispy calamari app is amazing. entree salads are HUGE. pastas come with a side salad. the banana split dessert is fun.  bonus - some locations carry cheesecake factory cheesecake or cake!!! warning though, do not try any of their mini desserts."}
{"text":"I have been here, to this PB for years and years.   Perhaps had dinner/lunch here maybe twice. TWICE. Their food is just not all that special. Basically there is nothing at PB that is all that authentic and I submit that I could easily find far more tasty dishes at an equal or lesser price point somewhere else.   You want pasta? Go to Little Italy. Want some fish, my gosh, there are tons of other places. Coffee? They are a dime a dozen and are everywhere. Asian? Come on... Etc...etc...  Sure the menu is quite large but chains have never inspired me as a place to go eat if there is a better option. So what do I do when the rare time comes in which I find myself at this locale?  Drink.  Plain and simple.  Although in fairness, I have had some of their cheesecakes, again, maybe twice. They are not bad.   In fact the main draw for me has always been their location. The bar is not too bad for an impromptu drink, specially if you are meeting out-of-towners or need a quick place to sit down with friends when in the neighborhood. As PB's bar never seems to be busy and it is easy to get a table.   Why PB's bar? Nicer than a pub, not as packed nor as loud as the other venues across the street on the Northeast corner. Reasonably priced and it is easy for out of town friends to find as they get underground parking.   I give it an extra star simply because the locale is convenient."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. My favourite dish is the lobster and shrimp pasta dish. It was lunch time and I didn't want a large portion so I asked for the lunch menu option. Same dish smaller portion. Guess what it was only a $1 less than the dinner portion??!! I would like to know how much smaller it was than?!!   Lovely staff. Clean space. I like their menu for it's variety."}
{"text":"I eat here when I have no imagination left and don't mind overpaying for average food.   I might recommend if your party has divergent tastes and you can't agree on any restaurant. Menu is very broad in terms of types of cuisine and health-consciousness."}
{"text":"You are severely overrated. Ridiculously large menu, I can understand why people go here. I CANNOT understand, however, why people line UP to go here.  This is one of those places that you think is reallyreally cool when you're like 15 and you're still discovering what it is like to \"eat out\" without the parents...but realize that it's just another gross chain in disguise that you'd rather not give your business to. So if you're over 20 and still frequenting this place and think it's cool, I'd take a second to re-evaluate myself.  In fact, if you're under twenty, do yourself a favour and go to burger king and save a little money.  Really, people.  you can find something better. QUITE easily, infact."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is pretty nice. The servers have always been very friendly and honest about the food. The Bloody Caesers are good but very mild, not any spice at all really. I got mine \"Barrel-sized\" which you would think meant bigger, but it really only means adding an extra shot (which I didn't taste at all, I'm not sure if I even got what I paid for). To eat, I got the Lobster and Jumbo Shrimp Linguine. I was hoping to get the rose sauce, but the waitress didn't ask, so I forgot about it until mine came with the white sauce. I didn't say anything but regretted it when I started to eat it. I think that the sauce was burnt possibly, it had a bad taste to it. I didn't enjoy it. I've had some OK experiences here, the mini desserts are great, but overall my past two experiences here have been lacking."}
{"text":"Full disclosure on this review: Pickle Barrel has made us mad.  PB is well aware of this situation and has done little to correct it.  The result will be this cautionary and disappointing review.  We took advantage of a free appetizer coupon in a theatre playbill after a show.  We ordered the nachos as well as two blue cheese steaks that come with salad.  The nachos came out in an appropriate time (and were tasty), however were immediately followed by our salads.  It's a bit much on the table but we can manage it.  What's not manageable however is when your steaks show up 5 minutes later and all of a sudden it's so crowded, your steak plates are half off the table (and cooling quickly).  Many customer service failures happened after this.  First, the male server who walked by a dozen times and didn't bother fixing what was obviously too much food at one time (or metering the way it should've come out in the first place).  Second was the manager who walked by and asked how everything was and our reply was 'we have too much food', to which she responded 'looks like you're making out OK'.    But the biggest, ultimate fail was dealing with Pickle Barrel over the next week.  The restaurant manager refused to acknowledge that anything was wrong with having all that food on the table at once but offers to make it right by coming back again.  When pushed for what that means, she says she will give a free appetizer on the repeat visit and nothing more.  Unsatisfied with this (the appetizer wasn't the problem), we called back to talk to her only to find her out of the restaurant but the CEO himself around to take our call.  He promised to investigate it and call back that day.  Two weeks later and no reply, we called him back only to be put through to the Manage of Complaints, who actually (after a web search) turned out to be his assistant.  She not only agreed with the restaurant manager that nothing was really wrong but actually went a step further and said we should've tried complaining harder on the day of, implying it was our fault for not pushing harder.  She offered a $20 coupon, which is basically a glorified appetizer.  Still unsatisfied, we tried emailing the CEO and received no reply, likely because the email went straight to the assistant we already dealt with.  Pickle Barrel, your customer service sucks, and we will never come back.  Every step up the employee ladder has been met with people that clearly need more training in service and less in fiscal concerns.  Our steaks were cold and the side dishes lumpy and gross.  Your server doesn't care, your restaurant manager doesn't care, your CEO doesn't care..this is a chain that takes customers for granted.  On your website it says you constantly ask yourselves 'how can we do better?'.  I can't come up with any way you've tried to do that in this scenario.  There are many other options in areas where Pickle Barrels exist.. I suggest you visit any of them but this chain."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service. Good for families. The nachos were outstanding. A large selection of drinks."}
{"text":"My friend and I hit this Pickle Barrel for breakfast while her car was being serviced.  The early breakfast special was a good deal, though my scrambled eggs were greasy.  The fruit skewer was better than I expected.    However, we eventually got so tired of waiting for the bill - then of waiting for the credit card to be picked up - that we actually took it over to the waitstaff station to beg someone to put it through.  That's the Pickle Barrel for you, though - nice ambiance, inoffensive food, and neglectful service."}
{"text":"Amazing food, deserts and drinks. They also have a new menu and it is delicious! The service is great!  Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, good service, reasonable prices. Came here with my family and was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Terrible service, it took them almost an hour to get our food, and there was literally only one other table in sight. The waitress accidentally gave our food to some other people and didn't even bother coming to inform us what had happened until our food actually arrived. The only saving grace was the food itself (I had the house burger and my friend had the free range turkey), but seeing how it's a franchise, that's nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is so nice! Perfect for get together with friends. Grab food, and drinks. I love their cheesecakes! I ordered the strawberry cheesecake and it was amazing. I also had the fish, i forgot the name of the dish was. It has veggies and beansprouts, I didn't really like it that much. I feel like they're going for the sweet and sour fish taste.. with vinaigrette.  But it has brown basmati rice. And it's so dry omg. Never gonna order brown basmati rice on their menu again. It was a nice meal. Very delicious. Except  server kept forgetting to punch our order. She did it 3x."}
{"text":"If you're broke, love tasty burgers and live in Da Burgh or just visiting.... THIS IS YOUR PLACE! I love this place... CHEAPEST BURGERS IN TOWN! The only down side is... it's not 24 hour! I now live back in California and a tear comes to my eye every time a thought passes through my mind of my dear Pickle Barrel... tasty morsels.... out as fast as they went in. WE WILL REUNTIE THIS SOON!"}
{"text":"We were in the downtown area for the revealing of the Christmas windows at the Bay. Before we headed there we decided to grab something to eat.   This was my first time here, and I have heard many good things about this restaurant through a lot of people. As we got in we waited about 15 mins to get seated. Since it's near Ryerson University it tends to be really busy. We got seated on the upper floor, and we were given our menus during the mean time to have a look and see what we like.   There are a lot of options to choose from. We waited and waited for the waiter to come to our table, we got in at 6pm and were served at 7:30-8pm. As our waiter finally made his way to the table he was really rude and had a really bad attitude. Since it was my first time here I wanted to know what was a popular dish on the menu, he gave me a really disgusting look and said everything is good. I'm like ok, and decided to order a pasta with sweet potato fries on the side with one Bellini.  We received the Bellini first which tasted like water pretty much, and was really really sweet. I haven't tasted a Bellini like this before :/. After the drink we didn't see the waiter for a good 45 mins. He never came to ask if we wanted anything else or how the drink was. One of my friends had to call him over so we could ask him about our food. P.s the restaurant wasn't busy at all, so his behavior was really rude. Our food came after an hour and at this point we were already late for the revealing for the Christmas windows at the Bay.   The pasta had so much oil in it, that there was literally a puddle of oil. My sweet potato fries were burnt. As I tried to call him again the ask him about my order he just never showed up. As I was already done with my pasta, he came to ask if I wanted any extra cheese. What's the point now to ask? Even after we were done with our dinner, he never came around the ask us about the food or even give us the bill. We literally had to get up and go to the front to pay cause the wait was getting ridiculous. This is one restaurant I did not tip, cause I was not happy with the service I received or even the food I ate. Will most definitely will not be going back ever!"}
{"text":"Went there on a weeknight. I've always been to the one at Yorkdale which is normally fantastic. But this location was on the way home so decided to try it out with a friend. I ordered my normal Fish Taco and their drink special - beer for $5 dollar. Not only did the food took way too long to arrive. My fish taco was tiny! Barely any avocado, the fish was cold. They went pretty cheap on the sauce too.   I will not come back to this location. The servers were friendly and tentative, but it's not worth it. I would rather go to the yorkdale location."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the service has always been great but what happened yesterday?  My girlfriends and I came here last night. The restaurant wasn't busy at all.  Our server took 15-20 minutes to take our order and our food came 40-45 mins later! And not once did he check up on us.  To make things worse our food wasn't all that great either. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Bad service. Our server made snarky remarks throughout, and took so long to even come and take our orders. After, the food took so long to come and was not very good. My potatoes were burnt, as were my bacon. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The food here (and at any Pickle Barrel) is a hit or miss. Most of their appetizers are really good but their entrees are never consistent. The safest thing to order is pasta if you don't want to be disappointed. Service is below average. I've been coming here for the past 8 years and only once did I have a really good server. Overall, it's not the greatest restaurant but if you're in the mall it is convenient."}
{"text":"Don't really get the hype about this place. The food is mediocre at best and the service is terrible whether they are busy or not. All the servers seem indifferent."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Had a Blue Burger. Blue cheese, sauteed mushroom, applewood smoked bacon with a large beef patty. Burger was nice and meaty.  Also ordered sweet potato fries, and I think they were like $2.99 extra or something above and beyond normal fries.  They were average. Not sure it was worth the $2.99. However, I really liked the burger and melted blue cheese.  Tasted really good.   As for the location itself, located right next to Eaton Centre.  Decent service, clean, and okay ambiance.  The dining area is nice, but the bar area seemed too crowded.  Verdict: Not bad for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Decided to go to pickle barrel for a quick decently priced dinner. Definitely worth the price you pay. Very big issue today was with the service. Took a very long time to even acknowledge us at the table, was very unpleasant as well. We had drinks that never got asked to be refilled we did not get acknowledged once during the entire meal. So they get a 3/5 because the service was horrendous. Very disappointed because I usually have had good experiences at other pickle barrels."}
{"text":"WARNING! Food poisoning and salmonella! First and last time coming here! After reading most reviews people only come here out of sheer convenience! Seems about right.  Walked through the door and the hostess was very rude right off the bat, and when we were finally seated literally AT the mall entrance when we specifically entered through the parking lot entrance to avoid sitting in that section, bug whatever we let it pass because we were hungry. I said \"thank you!\" To the hostess, and I was literally speechless when she replied with \"k\". But lucky for her I wasn't going to let that ruin my mood tonight.  Got 22oz shock top which was okay but served without the orange slice which is partly why I order it, again I didn't say anything other than thank you! Our server was quite nice and quick which earned this restaurant the 1 star (as if I had a choice to go lower)  I got chicken and waffles (way overpriced at $16.99) because I specifically was in the mood for those. They came quickly and everything tasted decent.  I got home and felt my heart start to hurt and began to worry. Later that heart pain turned into gastro pain and would radiate in and out like cramps, like food poisoning. I couldn't sleep all night because of that pain, hugging the toilet for hours until 6:30am.   Regretfully this review may come across as accusatory, however I visited the doctor and truly DID have salmonella after dining here. No accusations, just the absolute TRUTH. Just looking at the pics I posted makes me want to puke"}
{"text":"Not good for peanut allergies (PA)  Came here with the kids and it looks like anything deep fried (french fries, chicken fingers,  etc...) or pre processed (chicken fingers - not like Jack Astor ' s) are off limits.  Good that they are precautions but kind of limits what PA can eat. For a restaurant that supposed to be health conscious,  buying pre processed food, not being able to accommodate PA is a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"There are few words to say how bad our brunch was here.  Let me try: slow, cold, soggy, wrong.   Came with a group of 5, thinking it'd be a fast place for brunch before our friends hopped their train back to Montreal.  We were seated in isolation, meaning that even the server couldn't find us.  Ordered coffees, and an americano but instead, got a double espresso (then ordered a hot water to make my own, so crisis adverted). 20 minutes later, got up to find the server to place our orders: Fried eggs, eggs benny, waffle, chicken and waffle.   20 minutes waiting- got up to find the server, found the manager (Wally) accidently, who tried to mitigate the situation by giving us buy-two-meals-get-a-free-appetizer at-our-next-visit coupons, and checking up on our order.  Food is delivered by Wally after 5 minutes (thats 45 mins from ordering, for those who are keeping count). Eggs were cold, waffles: so soggy we couldn't even pick them up with a fork, never mind eat them.   3 of the 4 meals remain completely untouched.   20 more minutes of waiting before getting up to get the server (again), run into Wally (again).  Explain the current situation to Wally- and though we're happy to pay for our emptied coffees, and the one meal that was eaten, we're really not sure what to do about the other three. Wally looks a little upset, asks us if we would like our meals re-made (clearly, the train won't wait, so: no), then takes care of our bill for us.     That one star on this review reflects Wally's efforts to make things right.   Still hungry, we stopped at a near by Tim's for brunch round two- better service, better food; which is sad, at best.   I filled out a feed back form to head office that same afternoon (Sunday Feb 9), but never heard back."}
{"text":"I used to love Pickle Barrel as a kid, but it's gone very downhill. Less Jewish deli items, more generic food. The menu is diverse, but no dish really stands out. Mediocre service, this location is okay. Good for a generic meal out."}
{"text":"PROS: 1. A fall back to Dundas Square restaurant when Milestones and Jack Astors are all full. This place is massive and you can always find a spot.   2. Their molten lava cake is presented in a sundae style. So yummy!!   CONS: 1. Food is mediocre, but I give them props for being consistent lol.   Overall: -Go for dessert and get the molten lava cake, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Wow! Food poising warning yet again? Deff inanely scary! Especially since we bring our children here! I would deff inanely drop My rating from the 3.5 stars to what this place was to us, to a ZERO!!! Getting people sick and getting paid for it? Companies get sued and lose their license for that!!!   Below is my Previous review.  Which is Currently irrelevant. But out of respect I chose not to delete. And hope to see and hear positive changes coming our way!   The food is good here, every time we've been here the servers were ok not too  good.  The Place gets busy, and I would Hate to sit in the middle Of the place, I love getting a booth. The drinks a mediocre, but not bad. Kids menu is good, the kids actually eat their dinner! Overall we like it"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch here on a beautiful friday afternoon.  they have a very small patio (3 tables) so we ate outside.   Good beer menu, had the Steam whistle - delicious ;)   for lunch I ordered the Cali Chicken Grill Chese with fries.   It was fair size sandwich - just the right size for a lunch.   Fries were good too!"}
{"text":"Not a good spot for lunch as they move at a snail's pace. Almost 5 mins to get even noticed by our waiter. And over another 5 mins to even get our drinks and order taken. Don't know what the food tasted like cause we didn't stay. I have lunch from 12 to 1pm and if at 12:30 I don't have a drink or food in front of me...what is the point????? Maybe I'll try another time!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, where is my seat, found it. Server was cute, he thought, NOT.  Food was ok, nothing to write home about or yelp about. California grill cheese was ok. I had a roast beef, pastrami turkey sandwich, lots of meat shoved in bread with ranch dressing, why ranch? It was late and the restaurant was trashed, dirty tables, floors, and restroom."}
{"text":"I first went to the Pickle Barrel around 2003. Liked the place and for what it's worth, it was probably the best of a bad lot of NYC style delis here in the NYC of Canada. A couple of years later, I came back for brunch only to see they remodeled it and all of a sudden it looked like I was at 21 instead of the Stage Deli. It's was slick. And sheik. And now it was two floors. Top floor was all bar and downstairs was the dining area not resembling a deli at all. Brunch was great and the stuffed french toast was incredible with an excellent texture and filling and of course, real Canadian Maple Syrup. Would you expect anything less up here? The place does kind of now remind me of a Jerry's Famous Deli in Marina del Rey, CA which also has a bar and is a bit slick. But not like this. If you need a deli fix in TO, this is the place to go until a real deal NYC clone shows up."}
{"text":"Like how the other reviews said, the service here is slow and not exactly the best.  No complaints on the food though.  Not to be rude but it may be because the servers here are not the youngest which may result in the slow service."}
{"text":"Michael our Server was great! Best pickle barrel in the GTA food was fresh and delicious! Best customer service, keep it up guys!!"}
{"text":"My final word: good food, decent price.   My experience: I went on a weekday evening. It was not very busy, and I had a pleasant experience.   The good  Service was quick and the girl serving us was pleasant.   Food was about the quality that was to be expected. Not fantastic, but decent.   Restaurant was clean.   The bad  Not a whole lot of negatives. If I want to be picky I could say the decor needs an update. It looks like a slightly nice Swiss Chalet.   Menu is huge. This could be a pro depending on your point of view. I found it a little unwieldy.   Overall   Would go again, depending on the context."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday around 1:30pm and ordered their triple layered grilled cheese. I mean come on! It is pain and simple grilled cheese guys!!!!! there was so little cheese and way too much butter. And plus the bread was not grilled properly at all!!! so the butter was way too overpowering and the cheese was very rubbery and not soft and gooey like it should be. If a restaurant cannot make a grilled cheese sandwich properly, then I dont think it can make anything else good. I don't think ill be coming back."}
{"text":"Service was very slow even though it didnt seem too busy. Seated ourselves and waited about 15 minutes before our orders were taken. The menus were greasy and absolutely disgusting, see photos. The bathroom wasn't too clean and it was only one room. Not sure if there are more downstairs, we seated ourselves upstairs. I probably wouldnt return and wouldnt recommend."}
{"text":"We were a group of 7 for dinner. We walked in and up to the hostess and asked how long the wait was. She told us 20-30 minutes. So we said ok, and waited in the seating area. I asked if she needed a name to be able to call. She told me no, I will seat you when we are ready. 45 minutes later, I walked to the podium as people that were walking in after us were being seated. I said \"we've been waiting for a table for over 45 minutes\" she says \"it will be about 15 more minutes\" never once apologized, again refused to take my name... Anything to assure me she would indeed seat is. After waiting another 25 minutes. I walked up to the podium and said \"you originally told us 20-30 minutes, we have been here over an hour and have yet to be seated, this is absolutely ridiculous. We will dine elsewhere\" To which she replies, again without a single apology \"ok\". Horrible. Horrible. Horrible.  However, the restaurant, Milestones, that we found after this horrendous experience was most definitely 5+ stars, sooooo, we win."}
{"text":"The restaurant is huge, so that's the good thing about going on a Friday or Saturday night: low wait times. However, each of the wait staff have a lot of customers and several orders are getting messed up. The service was fairly fast and the food tastes pretty alright.    Would not recommend getting the chicken skewers because they are unable to replicate the authentic Mediterranean taste.   The basa fillet is good and so is the Hoison chicken lettuce wraps for appetizers.   Bathrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Naive tourists beware do not eat here and save your money!! Came here today for the first time for lunch with my family. The staff we extremely unwelcoming and not helpful. The female bartender at the Yonge street entrance could have cared less that we were looking for a table. This however was nothing in comparison to our server Oz. I have never been served by such a miserable, cold, and inattentive server. The wait for the food was extremely long for a nearly empty restaurant. I ordered the avocado toast and the poached eggs were over done. Everything was extremely over priced for the amount and quality of food. Will not be back and will not recommend anyone to dine here."}
{"text":"Great menu, good food and always consistent! Good options for vegetarians and health conscious people."}
{"text":"We didn't came to this location in along time. We had an amazing service today thats why I am writing this The food was amazing (I think they change the breakfast menu) my hubby ate chicken and waffles and I ate the miga ranchero and Pancakes, well I was I little concern about it because every time that restaurants  try to do a mexican dish always its the wrong flavours and as a mexican girl specially I know how mexican food flavours are and how to cooked them  was difficult to believe this dish could be good but I was wrong its AMAZING  delicious love it love it!! Also the plus was our waiter Fred Lau very friendly and quick and always checking our table we never have to ask for a refill of coffee or have a messy table. We will come again over and over to this location."}
{"text":"Lemme start by saying..Tuesday special bellinis are HUGE!   First time dining in a pickle barrel, I like the 'bigger group' tables because of the privacy. Food came out decent times and service towards the end was a bit slow especially trying to get the check but it's a chain restaurant, don't expect much in that sense. Portions were fairly large and tasted pretty good.   Mhm some items we ordered were,  California avocado spring rolls, $10 - it tastes wayyyyy better then it's sounds or what you expect it to taste like, everyone should try it once.   Build your own breakfast for $10 - you get to choose your protein, the way you want your eggs and 2 sides ( mini tatter tots, sliced toast, French fries, English muffin) if you choose toast, you can an assortment of spreads and jams.  3 Cheese Gnocchi $17 - they are serious about the amount of cheese, it was def really cheesy filled. This was my first time trying gnocchi and I love it. Yay I have another Italian option.   Good food , good environment. Def comming back :)"}
{"text":"A must when you power shop at Vaughan Mills. Good portions, nice staff, and not a long wait.  The charcuterie board is a great value and the nacho app is worth the money."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place!   What's with all dem haterz?  It's a chain, so just deal with. There's a reason a single restaurant becomes a chain..it's because they have a good product(s).  I've loved the Pickle Barrel ever since I was a teen, and I still love this place for memories of my teenage years.  This location (Atrium @ Bay) is my favourite.  The décor is really nice, and they have some great seating arrangements.  I love they're burgers, and the surf and turf is awesome.  My steak and meat is always cooked perfectly ( I love the medium rare)  The Bellini's and Daq's are HUGE.  I suggest if you want to get all liquored up, don't order them. If you want something delicious to sip on through your meal, order em.  And then there's the desert menu.  Just one thing to say about that:  DIABETUS MAXIMUS.  Go all out and get the sampler. You'll regret it right after you eat it, maybe for the next day or two, but a few days later, you'll wanna do it all over again."}
{"text":"Great friendly service! And the food is proper!!   Pickle Barrels vary location by location- this one is a good one.   The Newmarket location is crap, as I've noted before. They're cheaping out on portions to try and save money... the fressor was the flag for me.  At this location, it's big, and great!  See pic"}
{"text":"I walked in with low expectations (after all, the place is called Pickle Barrel), and I'm glad to say that my expectations were well met. It's like going to one of the nicer sit-down restaurants at Disneyland: huge space, plenty of wait staff but slow/apathetic service, and mediocre food that serves all types of palates but not particularly well. The blended alcoholic drinks were very weak. At least it's less expensive than I would expect considering the location and \"eatertainment\" type ambience.   Pickle Barrel's alright, but it definitely wouldn't be my first, second, or even third choice for a meal in the area."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, slow service. Ordered the Thai Beef Salad, which was supposed to come with soba noodles, but they looked more like spaghetti. Beef was tough, peppers were over cooked/ soggy. Their chocolate milk shake was pretty bad as well, tasted of cheap, instant chocolate syrup. Bathrooms were also quite dirty, both toilets were full, un-flushed and dirty, and urinals had puddles of urine on the floor around them.  Best avoided."}
{"text":"Terrible. Our appetizer order was taken incorrectly and they delivered the wrong meal, trying to say that the Cobb salad they delivered was in fact a Greek salad. Seriously?!?"}
{"text":"I've been to this Pickle Barrel numerous times in the heart to downtown Toronto at Yonge and Dundas Square. It's usually really busy but it wasn't too bad when we went during the Christmas holidays on a Sunday evening. Our server was very nice and it sometimes felt like he was a bit annoyed by all our requests but it was all good. I ordered the Steak Frites which came with a fries. I also asked for gravy on the side as well. Food took a bit longer to come out but it was probably because it got a lot busier when we first arrived. Our server was nice enough to help us take some group pictures and it was a good dinner for all of us. We left the restaurant pretty satisfied with the dining experience and service. It's a good casual restaurant to go to if you are in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"What the heck! The worst food i had so far! Their \"featured\" ribs was too salty and gross with dried up mashed potato tasted like a brick! The avocado egg rolls were microwaved to dryness! Poor service! The waitress was all about the featured ribs and when we told her about salty ribs she was like \"oh I know I know!\" Then why did u recommend it??  Awful food! Awful service! This place sucks! Doesn't even deserve one star! More like a zero or negative!"}
{"text":"I don't know why every Pickle Barrel I go to seems like it's way too big and they have way too many items on the menu. However, I would like to say I always order Asian Nachos and they are always delicious. If I made more money (I'm just graduating college), I would come to these restaurants more often and get something other than an appetizer. They have some really cool drinks too; the White Freezie is so good!"}
{"text":"I had such a great lunch at the other Pickle Barrel nearby, that I decided to grab some breakfast here a few days later. Well it was my second choice, because Eggspectation was extremely packed. Anyways we had such a good meal, that I am kind of happy that the other place was too busy. I ordered a delicious mixed berry waffle. It was pretty good and to wash it down, I had some orange juice. The place serves breakfast all day, so don't worry about getting here at any particular time. Go, because while it may be a small chain, Pickle Barrel is greatness!"}
{"text":"Don't know why reviews are so negative, maybe it was different way before we came here. Got here for lunch and it's our first time. People are extremely nice and so welcoming. The food was served really fast (not longer than 5mins for the appetizer) I got the tilapia with creamy lobster and man it is good, you can tell that the fish is fresh. Place looks wonderful, washroom is also nice cos everything is automated. The restaurant manager even stopped by to check on us if we're doing okay and later on Rebecca (server) told us that our appetizer is on the house since it's our first time. Isn't that cool? Will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a Pickle Barrel before! I loved all of the free-range options. I got the free-range turkey burger and it was absolutely delightful. It was piled high with the veggies and the bun-to-sauce ratio was A+. The restaurant also had a great ambiance for our large group, and there were plenty of drink specials.   The only downside was that the service was slow to get us seated despite the many empty tables, and slow to take our orders. But once our orders were in, the food came pretty fast. Overall, I'm very happy with the experience and with my food!"}
{"text":"We stopped in as a party of 6 (3 adults & 3 kids). I wouldn't say i'm a huge fan of Pickle Barrel, but it has a lot of variety and the pricing is fair. What i don't like about it is that the menu is ALWAYS changing! We happened upon this location after shopping at a nearby warehouse sale. Kids were hungry and it's a much better option than fast food!  We ordered for the kids. Everything came out fairly quickly while we looked over the menu deciding on appetizers & drinks. Our server was fantastic! Always nearby by providing napkins, refills and clearing away plates when we needed. They were great with our daughter's food allergy and assured us her food would be prepared safely.   I had the BBLT - great sandwich with mmmmm lots of prosciutto & bacon with avocado, tomato, lettuce & a garlic mayo made in house. Great sandwich even though it sound like a plain ol' blt - it was super delish!  Kids all had tenders & fries - all made to order and fresh.  Hubby had a burger & fries that did not disappoint and it wasn't dry or overcooked.  Meatloaf & mashed potatoes was the 3rd adult main - delicious!  Food was great, service was great! I would definitely go back if i was in the area!"}
{"text":"surprisingly good food for a chain. the burgers, chicken fingers, bruchetta, and coconut shrimp are all very good compared to other places in toronto. as a new yorker, i don't feel right giving this place five stars, but it is very cute. the menu is massive so it's a good place to bring people with a range of cravings. prices are a little on the high side but not too bad.   service ranges night by night. sometimes it's very attentive, sometimes you can actually watch your waitress sit down at a booth with her friends and have a cocktail instead of checking on your order."}
{"text":"My boyfriend really wanted to get beer in a boot and I went here a few weeks ago with my girlfriends to get one so we thought we would see if they were still there. We saw them on the bar when we walked in so we decided we would eat dinner there. When we were seated the server said they weren't selling them so my boyfriend went upstairs to ask the bartender. We informed the server they were still selling them and he apologized and brought him one.   We shared the pesto chicken linguini ($16) which was delicious, I didn't really eat because I had a large booster juice before dinner. I really like that kind of pasta. I got it because I tried my friend's dinner last time and enjoyed it.  The desserts here are also yummy! I would recommend the black forest cake!"}
{"text":"Haven't gone in years and decided to give it a try. Server was attentive, food came together so no one left out. Problem, the menu was too big. Should be more streamlined. The food was actually better than Shopsy's. Will definitely be on our rotation."}
{"text":"The Pickle Barrel is a great choice for a restaurant that servers almost everything.  Your entire family/party will find something they like.  The hardest part is deciding on what to get!  The food quality is excellent and they go far with creating an impression with the food layout.  From Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwiches to Red Thai Curry Stir Fry, the variety of foods still exceed many other higher end establishments.  Great drink menu and nice décor.  (This location was the old Houston's Steak House)  4 Star All Day long!"}
{"text":"In Greek myth, the sirens are alluringly gorgeous women who leer at and taunt passing sailors from the rocks of their islands, only to watch them die as their ships crash against the shores.    They could just as easily be servers from the alluring-looking Pickle Barrel near Dundas Square.  Entering from the street, my dinner partner and I first made the mistake of going down the escalator to the lower dining area, where we were forced to make our own way through the labyrinthine arrangement to locate the greeting area all the way in the back.  Would it be so difficult to set up a station at, you know, the base of the escalator?   Wow.  That's a huge menu.  Is that going to mean that this place doesn't have a specialty or two that it can really do well?  Seems so.  My dirty martini tasted more like something from a medicine cabinet than olive. Waited far too long for the second one (I was hoping for the best), and the server simply left the previous, dirty glass on our table.  Throughout our entire meal.  My partner's lobster ravioli looked like it had been tossed together with a slingshot. My salmon penne had a nice zip to it, but the penne oozed with the grease that meandered in the bottom of the ridiculous rectangle serving dish. The salmon was a mush.  Each of us having pasta dishes, at no time were we offered parmesan.   Oh, look.  Now I have two, yup, two dirty ex-martini glasses on our table.    When time for coffee came, our server gushed over how pleased he was to be making a fresh pot, and when it arrived, his beaming and praise for the coffee was endless.  He fawned over me as I fixed milk and sugar in my cup.  Oh, yes, he was proud of that coffee.  Proud and happy and gushy and fawning, yes.  Because, isn't it great coffee?  Happy to serve you your coffee, sir.  Lovely coffee.  He reminded me of my mother, and of all those times in my childhood when she would tell me, \"If you put as much energy into that crap you're fucking around with as you should for your grades, you'd actually get something done, kid.\"   Yeah.  Maybe Pickle Barrel coulda listened to her too."}
{"text":"i went here for the first time and was quite upset with the honesty of the workers. i ordered a blueberry muffin and a vanilla bean latte ( i originally wanted a green tea latte but the worker was like oh, \"even though it's on the menu we don't actually do this latte anymore. i can do the vanilla bean latte though.\") she said it was sweet and even was like i added more syrup to make it sweeter and i kid you not when i tried it, it was like a cup of complete lies. it was more bitter than bitter melon and seriously it was NOT sweet at all like no sweetness whatsoever ... so it was like BRUH WHY YOU GOTTA BE LYINNG ?!?! WHAT DID I DO TO GET LIED TO?!? anyways aside from that whole ordeal the muffin was actually pretty bomb. i love muffin tops and that is what i look for in muffins (les be real here, the muffin exist for its muffin top) one extra star for the bomb-ass muffin"}
{"text":"This is the WORSE restaurant I have EVER experienced in my life! Hostess looks like she's gonna kill u and sits you at the most crooked table in the place even they are empty...dirty tables, dirty glasses...waiters took 10-15 minutes to come and greet us...the food was ok but on the cold side...mix up in bills...the only good thing is the fact they have a patio and that day it was sunny...TERRIBLE!!! Don't waste your money there ...there's plenty better around the corner"}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was terrible. The server was giving us attitude when we asked for the drink to be changed. We also never got the soup and salad that we ordered. Never coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Would not recommend. The food is like cafeteria food, overpriced and bad quality. The menus are also disgustingly dirty so bring hand sanitizer or wash your hands before your meal. The service is also awful, the server came to our table a total of three times throughout the whole two hours we were there and didn't give us napkins or cutlery even though we asked multiple times. She also took over 30 minutes to bring the bill. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Visited this evening for dessert as my sister-in-law has had one of their cakes from La Dolce and wanted to go back. We were seated quickly and I find that the hostess stand at this location always is friendly and quick so kudos to them. When we sat down we were told our server would be with us shortly. He came around to introduce himself and we ordered 2 coffees and dessert, the Choco-o-sundae, plain cheesecake and Jennys Tiramisu. Our coffees came 15 minutes later and our dessert 25 minutes after the coffees. Our server dropped off the coffees and we could not find him to get extra milk. When we got a hold of him he dropped off 2 milks for 2 coffees. Finally when we dropped off our dessert after we waited we asked for the bill immediately knowing that this may take just as long. He dropped off our bill that came out to $33!!! crazy for 3 desserts and 2 coffees. We didn't even have a single meal. We gave him $40 and asked for change in which he dropped a toonie and walked off...we looked around trying to find him for the rest of the change and once he saw us pull out our cellphones to do the calculation he rushed back and was like oh here's $5. We were shocked that he tried to walk away with his own tip that he decided even though he was never around and took 25 minutes to bring us our dessert. He never apologized for the extremely long wait and handled the situation very poorly.   This will be the last time we return to the Pickle Barrel."}
{"text":"We came here for our dinner on our first night in Toronto. Our hotel staff recommended this restaurant for being kids friendly and within walking distance. We came in through Yonge Street and took the elevator down. First thing I saw was the dessert display next to the bar. I contemplated of ways on how I could get away eating just desserts for dinner. No great ideas came to mind, so I ended up with ordering a healthy dinner.  We were seated down in a booth. The waitress took our drinks order and gave our kids the coloring pages and kids menu. The drinks came and the waitress took our food order. We made a mistake of all four of us going to the washroom to wash our hands. When we came back, the drinks were all gone, coloring pages were gone and our table got mostly cleaned away. It's obvious someone thought we had left.   When we got back our waitress, she got us our utensils, napkins and coloring pages, but forgot our kids' drinks.   Then the food took forever to come. The restaurant was not that full. My guess was that our order got cancelled and our waitress forgot to re-order our food.   Food was just so so. Price was a bit on the pricey side. Service was slow. I don't think we will go back."}
{"text":"Pickle Barrel has always been a comfortable place for us to go. I like their fajitas and had it several times before, this time it was different though, still yummy but a different style. In fajita bowl, it was one third fried rice, one third stir-fried veggies, one third meat. I don't remember getting fried rice this much in my previous fajita orders. Sides were smaler than before as well. It is still a good value for the price you pay for fajita go, I would still order it next time."}
{"text":"oops I totally forgot I even had this pending.  Came out this past Saturday night with my date, though reserving a table was a wait, we decided to sit ourselves at the bar!  First off, like all Pickle Barrel locations, the decor is always appealing, fresh, up to date, and contemporary.  The server (bartender) was very helpful, and accomadating.  The food can sometimes be a hit or miss, depending on what you're ordering.   My date had the cajun atlantic salmon linguine which was a 4.5/5, freshness of the pasta, and the melody of the salmon infused with the creamy sauce and al-dente pasta! just a beauty to eat!  I had the sausage Rigatoni 3/5 not really the best! however the sausage was deliciously prepared, and it tasted great dipped in the tomato garlic sauce, this dish didnt BLOW me away, but it was good...I've had better.....  Overall the food was great, the service was excellent, the price was reasonable... 4/5"}
{"text":"Our group of 7 seven came here in the evening on a Friday night and waited around 5 minutes for our server to come around and give us a table - somewhat expected for a Friday night.  Our server was nice but not too attentive and, as far as I recall, did not come around to check up on our meal once.   The menu itself was very overwhelming and they may have fared better to narrow down and focus on a fewer number of menu options in the future. The main problem was the sheer time it took between us placing our order and us receiving our food; it was probably close to half an hour or even more.  We almost thought our server had forgotten our orders or something along those lines.  The food itself was mediocre, nothing too special.  My Hoisin chicken lettuce wrap was a mess to eat, so I just ended up eating the lettuce and chicken separately.  The lettuce was a little oily, so in general, this just wasn't an easy-to-eat dish.  Definitely not something you want to be eating on a first date!  A redeeming factor was no extra service charge for a party of 6+ people, since restaurants typically add on a tip for larger groups; our server was also very understanding in splitting our bill up at the end of the meal.  Overall, would only come back for convenience, but seriously lacking in terms of service and speed."}
{"text":"Came here at the suggestion of a colleague (since for some reason Pickle Barrel never seems to come to mind) and was, as I've been in the past, pleasantly reminded that it's actually not a bad place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a saturday night.  It was busy, but we got a booth right away.  So we had for the appetizer avocado rolls, 4 pieces and they were delicious. Try it if you are into that kind of thing.  I ordered fish tacos. They were not great. Try something else as this was not anything special.  The shrimp bowl was nice and filling, with about 6 pieces of medium size.   Service wasn't great. We had to wait sometime just to get our first drink orders. Also paying took long from moment we got the bill to when server actually returned."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant inside the mall. After a long day of shopping we came here for some dinner before driving back home.  I started with the wings and they were decent. As my main, I had their smoked meat plate and it was just what I needed to have. Great Smokey flavored meats and fresh rye bread.  Well done Pickle Barrel, I'll be back."}
{"text":"My experience, just like most others on this page was disastrous in the service department. The waitress had messed up the orders of about 3-4 tables around us before she'd come around to taking our order (we'd been already sitting there for about 30 mins).   My friend and I started to worry about what we'd be served (or not served for that matter). I ordered a milkshake that was supposed to taste like passion fruit. However, it came out distinctly tasting like strawberry ice cream. When I told the waitress how much I despise strawberry, she started arguing, quite rudely that I was mistaken and that it was Passion.   Wow, arguing with the patrons. Classy."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times because it is very close to home. It's also know for having a very large menu. Pretty much anything you can think of is on this menu. So this is a great place to go to when you can't decide what to eat. The all day breakfast is a bonus. Try the eggs Benedict Florentine, delicious... and I'm not a big breakfast eater.  Some other faves are: The Avocado spring rolls and the Chicken Shish kabobs. The Shish Kabobs comes with a Greek salad (not really authentic Greek salad) rice and grilled veggies.  Service can be slow at this location. This is however the only sit down restaurant inside Sherway Gardens."}
{"text":"Not sure why there's so much negativity towards this restaurant. This us one of our favroite restaurants and we've been coming here for years. I've dined here since it's early days when it was just a plain old deli eatery. The menu I'd extensive and the food is more than acceptable. It's affordable food in a classy atmosphere. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"It was a tue night and the restaurant was quite empty. A back kitchen staff showed our way in with his apron on. Ordered a steamed mussel and a mushroom and Swiss burger. Our food came pretty fast. My boyfriend didn't know what to order first but he thought he wouldn't go wrong with burger, oh boy how naive. The onion ring in his burger is cold. Sweet potato fries is not fresh. The ultimate bummer is probably my steamed mussel. For 9.99, the serving portion is good. But I had at least 4-5 bad sour mussels out of the whole bowl. A total appetite killer. We chose pickle barrel over the Johnny's burger place next door because we thought the food is better here. Clearly we are wrong, should've just buy a granola bar and skip dinner. Not coming back again."}
{"text":"After spending some time outside of Canada, I returned to this restaurant with my family hoping to find a good place to eat with nice ambience at a reasonable price. I found none of that. Portions have been shrunk to a laughable size. Taste never showed up. And the bill almost gave me a heart attack. It used to be a good place a few years back, but something happened to this restaurant (something bad). Such a shame..."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and decor is nice.  However, the food portion of the fish is too small. The pricing on the menu was not clear, thus we had the prices adjusted upon leaving. And the hand soap in the washroom did not work because they were all electronic, and were out of service at the time. It also took a long time to receive our food."}
{"text":"so if i was more diligent id have researched exactly what pickle barrel my wifes uncle purchased our family fandangos food from last night but i would stake my life on the fact that its probably the same what ever barrel youre choosing from.  so i wasnt all that excited but i came out satisfied i have to say.  i had a chicken soup with kneidlech (matza balls) and lokshen (noodles) and it was decent - a little lukewarm but warm enough, the balls and noodles were cooked to a near perfection, the soup mildly flavourful.  then i had some tuna salad salad with lettuce, broken pieces of tortilla chips of different colours, sprouts, a creamy dressing and a scoop of tuna.   pretty good i have to say.  creamy, crunchy, crazy combo.  that was rounded out with an open-faced corn beef/pastrami/turkey breast sandwich with a little yellow mustard.  that was decent.  ive surely had better but good enough.    cant say id ever go there instead of other places, but if i had to....id manage just fine."}
{"text":"Go anywhere but here. The waitress appeared to run around fast but we received the food very late.  Perhaps they are understaffed. But I did see many staff walking around. About 40 minutes in, the fajitas arrive, but the tortillas for the fajitas were fridge cold. Then the burgers came out 15 minutes after the fajitas.  They finally brought us (somewhat) warm tortillas about 7 minutes after the burgers (22 minutes after the fajitas.  We had to remind them to bring us the plates to eat the fajitas from, since we weren't going to eat it straight off the table. To top it off, I had two odd encounters with men in the washroom. I don't want to get into detail, but one was threatening and the other was a punishable offence. First restaurant that I've been to where you need body guards to go to the bathroom. What's even funnier is that at the end of the meal, I told my brother what happened, as I did not want to spoil the meal. He told me his encounter with a third gentleman, who was doing something much worse in the bathroom.  What kind of place is this??"}
{"text":"this place fricken sucks it took like 30 minutes after we were seated for a waiter to even come and ask us what we would like to drink. It wasn't even busy it was a Monday night terrible food lol it was way over cooked had to constantly ask for refills of water because they didn't even realize. @nancyc I did tell the server that the food was not good but she told me the kitchen was closed because they were closing early that day and we should've came earlier. But were there early! We got there at 7:30 and  they finally gave us attention at 8 brought our food at 8:30 and there kitchen was closed by then!"}
{"text":"The Pickle Barrel is a casual place to grab a nice dinner and comfortably chat. Over the years, I've been here multiple times and I've never had any qualms. I'll be back anytime for a special occasion or dinner. The drinks here are colossal :)"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend to grab dinner after a shopping excursion (shopping for a friend's birthday is hard work); we'd been on our feet for about two hours in the mall and wanted to go to a sit-down restaurant for dinner.  We waited for about 15 minutes and the hostess even managed to mess up the number of people in our party (we said 2, they heard 3?).  We were seated in a section that didn't seem too busy; we were honestly wondering why we waited so long because the restaurant didn't even seem that busy... there were lots of empty tables.  That probably should have been a warning sign that they were understaffed on a Friday night...  We got the following: - killer shake (chocolate) to share - chicken parmesan - blackened atlantic salmon penne  We got the shake very quickly... but the food... oh, the food... the wait....  I don't think either my friend and I waited this long for food from any restaurant.  It took about 40 minutes for our waitress to walk by and realize we still hadn't gotten our food.  We were very, very tired and very, very disgruntled about the service.  It took another ten minutes for the waitress to finally come over with our food and she had said \"there was a mix-up in the kitchen\"...  What was amusing (? interesting?) was that the table beside ours did not get cleaned up until a hostess asked someone to do it.  She had a party of 10 people to seat and needed someone to clean the table, so she got another employee who was in the area to do it and the funny (or not??) thing was he flipped out on her about how it wasn't his section to deal with and how she should find someone else to do it.  His attitude wasn't surprising but it seemed like he was miserable doing wait service on a Friday night.  Pickle Barrel should fix their wait service... I can't imagine what it'd be like if this is how it is every day.  The food was fine. But everything tasted bad because of the wait.  That being said, we're not coming back."}
{"text":"I don't know how long I can milk the ``I'm from out of town`` clause but I'm going to now!  Toronto has some chains I have never heard of, like this one.  It's busy and always full of people. So being a curious food hound,  I gave it a try!!! Now, chains always seem to get an awful rep over the little guys but this time round I was quite pleased.  We came in for brunch this past Sunday and I ordered my standard measure for breakfast: eggs, sausage, toast and has browns with coffee.  It was a pleasant surprise to me that it came with a maple turkey sausage!  I could have ate much more of those.   In addition, the potatoes it came with (very few of them I might add) were delightful! He described them as potatoe latkas.   Whatever they are,  they were f-i-n-e!  If you are on a budget and wanna splurge on a dessert because you have an uncontrollable sweet tooth.  They have something to offer you,  mini martini glasses filled with one of their flavours of cheesecakes.  i tried their banana chocolate pecan cheesecake for 1.99.  Yeah, $2.  Good times on the cheap people!"}
{"text":"I've come to this Pickle Barrel several times and the restaurant is very disappointing, in the downtown core you have many other options. However at the back of the restaurant, they have a take-away counter. That is why they will get 3 stars, it is actually a great counter.   They have huge chocolate chip muffins that are delicious and for lunch I went for the grilled chicken hummus wrap. SO GOOD! It has grilled chicken, hummus, black olives, red onion, and sun dried tomatoes. They have it all in a sun dried tomato tortilla that is then grilled to perfection.   I ordered it with crispy sweet potato fries and it was a good lunch.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Stay away from the Sherway Gardens Pickle Barrel.  The food is  lousy! The menu offers a lot of variety, but this is restaurant does not have the right stuff to deliver a meal worth paying for.  You are better off eating in the food court where you are certain to get a meal superior to anything the Pickle Barrel has to offer! Also, the portions delivered to your table is not as described.  Again, stay away!  You are better off stopping for a street hot dog."}
{"text":"We decided on Pickle Barrel because most restaurants we tried to go to this evening was beyond busy and had a minimum 45 minute wait.   When we arrived there was no one to greet us at the podium. In fact, a couple who walked in a few minutes after our party was greeted and seated immediately. So we asked for a menu.   After perusing through the menu and deciding to dine here, we were going to tell the server who handed us the menus we would like a table for 4 when another server (who happened to serve us for dinner) abruptly stepped in and took us. We felt a little awkward since initially we had no one greeting us at entry and now two servers were fighting over our dinner service.   We were given menus and less than 5 minutes to figure out our order. We of course needed a few more minutes and the a few more... Etc etc etc. Once we ordered our food we were asked half a dozen times about meal upgrades and additions. No thanks we already figured out our order now you're going to talk about hidden options? So we ordered some drinks. My fiancé and I ordered some house special Bellinis (again asking for an upgrade when you're offering the regular one on sale). We were served our Bellinis that contained no alcohol in them what-so-ever to warrant even spending $6 on them. Once our food came or server never returned to ask if everything looked alright or if there was anything else we needed.   My fiancé found the Jalapeño waffles far spicier than anticipated when he discovered a jalapeño stem in one of the waffles causing him to choke and need water to calm the spice.   We couldn't find any server around to help us at all!  One of our friends actually went around to the kitchen and flagged down one of the bussers for water and again for refills on our drinks and again for a round of water for the table.   Again our server disappeared and later was seen being scolded by her manager for behaviour problems. Very unprofessional.  While the food looked great, it is only skin deep. My fish and chips were terribly soggy. The Asian nachos were nothing but wonton wrappers with two pieces of chicken and a mountain of cheese and soy sauce, undercooked steak and just disaster upon disaster. There was nothing that was noteworthy of this evening's dinner apart from the experience. The abysmal service we received did not justify spending over $120 for a meal and drinks for 4 people.   It would have been nice if we were asked \"how's everything going?\" Rather than constantly harp us for meal upgrades and more expensive options.   What a waste."}
{"text":"If we're looking for positives, I suppose the location is very good. Also the presentation (how the food looks) is very nice.  Other than that it's very subpar. It's pricy, poor quality and the service is spotty. And the dining room is in the basement for some reason.   Also it's great that you're reply to all the reviews... But I think there's a consensus here: people want cheaper/ better food"}
{"text":"This is a real hit-or-miss location.  Sometimes the service is very good for a very busy location, at other times servers make you feel as though they're doing you a favour by being in their presence.  Recently I ordered the Pastrami on dark rye.  I was told there was no dark rye about 15 minutes after our order was placed.  Tsk, tsk....the ordering manager should not be running out of dark rye at the lunch rush.  I settled on light rye.  Not the same.  I asked for thin sliced and medium fat...but I got lean and a thick cut.  I sent it back and they got it right the 2nd time but everyone else was 1/2 way through their meals.  The fries were old but at this point I didn't want to send it back again.....and the cole slaw was warm, which tells me my plate sat under a heat lamp.  This location consistently serves warm slaw???  I've had some good experiences at this location but as stated before it is hit-or-miss.  Sorry but that doesnt' cut it."}
{"text":"Unmemorable food. Overpriced. Tourist trap. Bland. Poor service.  What more can I say? Came here for a company lunch and no one was overly happy with their food. The food was all lacking flavour. The burger was thin and soggy. Our server shot us dirty looks during the meal. Just don't go here. There's plenty better Canadian food options in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Steamwhistle tasted funny - maybe they need to clean draft lines? pumpkin cheesecake - unreal.. extra star burnt chicken & waffles - mgr took off the bill"}
{"text":"The other two reviews are spot on.  It's okay in a pinch, but there's nothing special or exciting about it.  I found the menu to be exhaustive.  It's just too big.  Pick a few things, do them well, and stick to them.  Otherwise it's just a whole lot of mediocre.  There is a serious lack of vegetarian items, as well.    The service was incredibly slow for getting our drinks, though the waitress was at least pleasant and friendly.  She also brought me a complementary chocolate mousse for my birthday, which was sweet.  I found the belinis to be absurd.  They are huge, and kind of flavourless, and just over the top with coloured sugar around the rim.  Nothing like I'm used to.  I'd rather have one half the size with twice the flavour, made with real ingredients, and no silly coloured sugar crystals.  It was more like drinking a slurpee out of a Big Gulp cup.  Though I must say I had really fabulous company, so I had a good time!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine is visiting from Regina and I met up with her here, and we watched the Grey Cup. Nice friendly staff, and decent drink specials, it was a Sunday and the ceasers were $5.  We both ordered the Pickle Barrel burgers, as the onion ring was on it. When it came, I was sad to see how small the onion ring was, and how small the patties were. You'd expect better quality from a chain restaurant, event A&W has better burgers,  a fast food joint.  I probably won't be back for food, as there are a ton of great fast food joints nearby that sell better burgers nearby. Overall, it was decent, but nothing to write home about. Services was on point though.   SIDE note: There's a lot of people coming and going in this location, as the restaurant is connected to the mall, and people use this as an entry way to the mall. Watch your personal belongings and make sure your purse is visible, as they've had some thefts there before according to our server. Touristy area, means keeping a keen eye on your belongings."}
{"text":"Well I had heard good things from past friends about this place. It became obvious that things had changed since they told me their thoughts.   Service: 9/10. Took care of us very well. Great sense of humour.   Atmosphere: 10/10.  Background just right, nicely decorated although nothing really jumping out.  Layout: 5/10. Very strange layout.  If coming in from the street level entrance, you go down an escalator and basically walk right through the service area to get to the hostess station at the complete other side.  Not at all good.  Food: 6/10.  I had the New York Strip.  Honestly I think a \"Blade\" steak would have been better.  Asked for rare and got something in between medium-rare and medium.  For me that ruined the meat.  Very tough.  I ordered mashed potatoes with gravy with their option of added toppings ( sour cream, green onion, applewood smoked bacon, mozzarella & cheddar cheese) for an extra $2.49.  The mashed potatoes came in a roughly 2 inch diameter 1.5 inch deep bowl.  The extras were on top of that.  There was so little it couldn't have cost them more than 20 cents.  What a rip off.  I also had the French Onion Soup.  Described as having \"Swiss cheese, parmesan crouton\".  Let's just say mine looked like it had a hamburger bun in it.  It definitely was not parmesan croutons!  I asked for a Caesar to drink with extra Worcestershire Sauce.  What I got was almost no Worcestershire Sauce but lots of Tabasco Sauce.  Drink ruined as well.  My partner had the Fried Chicken and Waffles.  I didn't try it but she seemed to enjoy it.  At least someones dinner seemed tasty.  In summary.....I will never go there again.  Way over priced and quality lacking."}
{"text":"We came on a Sunday night around 8:30pm. There was already a few people in line. The hostess was taking someone's credit card for payment. Not only she doing that, but when she finally sat someone to their table, she was running around doing something before returning to the hostess desk. They looked like they were short staff or the other waiters didn't care. There didn't seem to be any servers. After waiting to 5 -10 mins, we left for if it took that long to be seated when the place was empty, I can only imagine how long it would take to get our order and food.  All the staff look young and looked unmotivated to serve people. With all these bad reviews, you would think management would do something. I guess their mentality is they are in a tourist zone so business will always be contant. Save your money and time and go somewhere else. There are other restaurants who will appreciate your business. This place gave off that they didn't care and that you are needing them to get food due to location."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and was famished. I ordered the meat deli meal. I didn't receive the coleslaw sadly. And the Ceasar salad I ordered instead of fries was miserable. When I told the bartender she offered more dressing, but it was the dressing that was offensive. She didn't offer a replacement. The bread and selection of corned beef was delicious. The bartender was pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. If you are expecting regular Pickle Barrel service, do NOT come to this location. Our waiter was some bald, stumpy arrogant juice head who was either racist or offended that all we ordered was dessert and some drinks. He made it clear he did not want to be serving anyone, and kept sighing and rolling his eyes. He didn't bother coming to our table once and after having to ask another waitress (who was actually quite pleasant) if our order was coming, we had already waited 40 minutes. When we confronted him, he was so unbelievably rude and just started walking away when we were talking to him. He didn't even bother to bring us the bill! Do NOT go to this location if your waiter matches this description. Absolute nightmare. And to that server: you better get used to being ordered around, cause looks like you'll be doing it for the rest of your life."}
{"text":"Our experience here has been, well fairly good. Maybe we got lucky and always got the best staff on duty? Not sure...maybe they secretly knew I'm a Yelper? ha! doubt it..but here's the lo down: Only decent restaurant in Vaughan Mills to sit down in and have a meal, with plenty of tables so they never really have a wait.  The ambience is decent, and so is the food. We tend to stick to the few tried & tested menu items to avoid disappointment. The wine selection is ho-hum, but they have an extensive list of cocktails which are really good, especially the Mojitos. Oh, and must try the mini tiramisu in a martini glass. Very yummy. After all that mall walking, you know you need it!"}
{"text":"Ate here on Halloween. Totally regret it. The workers all hated being there on Halloween and it showed on their faces and in their service. The server who was covering for someone else, didnt write down our order. Just took it by memory. Missed an item when she inputted the order. 1 star off there.  My date ordered a simple breakfast meal and it was just terrible. Terrible. It was so mediocre I couldnt believe they served that as a restaurant quality meal. 2 stars off.  This location may look nice and big but its empty in food quality and service. Stay away. Just because they have a captive audience at Vaughan Mills they think they can get away with this. Spend your money on clothes at the mall instead of eating here. 2 stars **"}
{"text":"We always enjoy the wide choices from the Pickle Barrel's menu. This time we were early enough so I opted for the early-bird breakfast special which was reasonably standard with eggs, bacon, toast and a small piece of mellon. The scrambled eggs were a bit-overdone or maybe the plate sat waiting for my wife's chicken to be cooked for her salad. She thought the salad was great.  While the service wasn't bad, it started our with our waiter initailly informing us that we were in Canada, so forget the unsweetened ice tea. Other places, creativitly provide the hot tea pot with a large glass of ice to compromise for Americans!  I had the thought that our waiter was an unemployed actor from a closeby theater, just serving tables to pay the rent. I had to ask for the jelly tray to go with my toast. He did warm up as it got closer to tip time. Still would return for the reasonably good food at a convenient location."}
{"text":"#PICKLEBARREL #DUNDASSQUARE #DOWNTOWN #YELP  Pickle Barrel has always been my favorite mid-range chain. It beats Jack Astors and the likes. And like I've not already raved enough, their meatloaf is top-notch. And I say this despite the fact that they overcooked mine last time I went - just because I have been to PB enough times and ordered the same thing to know that 9/10 times, it's pretty perfect.   Unfortunately, my last experience wasn't the best:   - We were drenched in the rain and so the server wanted to seat us right beside the kitchen (bad seats). We refused and they had to seat us somewhere better.   - For whatever reason, huge delay in serving. But they made up for it with 25% off of the bill and complimentary desserts.   - Overcooked meatloaf   - Drinks, not the best  Margarita rating: 1/5 Coming back? Yes sir."}
{"text":"Some places *cough. Montana's. cough* serve disgusting, cooked-from-frozen meatloaf. But not Pickle Barrel. No Sir-ee Bob. That's all I have ever had at any Pickle Barrel location (true story) and it's the only meatloaf that comes close to the one my Mom makes!!   Plus my bf's BBQ platter was quite impressive. He loved it.   Will be returning for more \"Best Ever\" Meatloaf..."}
{"text":"Okay I understand most people are opposed to going to restaurant chains but as long as their food is tasty - why not right? With this said, I feel pretty bad about how low the ratings are for this little pickle because their food, in my opinion, was really good!  My mom and I did some shopping and we got really hungry and worn out from all the cardio we did so we decided to grab a bite.  I got the turkey burger and it was surprisingly really......... outstanding. I don't know if it was simply because it had my favourite ingredients in it (avocado and brie) but I can vouch for the fact that the turkey was lean yet juicy and every bite was a burst of flavour.  So YEAH, THERE, I SAID IT - I enjoyed Pickle Barrel's food!!!! I am not ashamed to admit it."}
{"text":"I found a living worm in my to go Chinese chicken salad a couple months ago and got a refund asap. I have never gone back."}
{"text":"Amazing place. It's a pricy but worth it. Very very nice staff. really good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Laziness breeds eating at chain restaurants. It's true. We've all done it. We want to eat, but we also don't want to wait in line. Or, get dressed up to go out. Or worry about running into people we know. Sometimes we want to go somewhere where they'll give us something that vibrates and lights up when our table is ready rather than shout our last name violently.  Thing is, when we have those lazy chain-meals, we are always disappointed in the end. This is the case with Pickle Barrel too.   However I will say this: its lunch is better than its supper."}
{"text":"The reviews for The Pickle Barrel are mixed so you can really only visit this restaurant with a positive, open mind.   Personally, I liked my experience. We were seated promptly, the customer service was good, everything arrived in good time. The food tasted good! Not \"to die for\" but good.   Criticisms that I have: the portions were either too small or the serving plates were too big, on both appetizers and meals.. There was a lot of empty space. The menu was too big, there were like 12 pages of so many incredible choices that it was difficult to read everything. The restaurant layout was totally weird but who really cares.   I can suggest going on a Thursday night, because it was relatively empty when I went. Be prepared to spend at least 50 bucks for two people. Best of luck!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place lower I would.....but to be fair, we never actually ate here. We visited for breakfast......on our way downtown to attend a show we thought \"lets give it a try\" Were greeted at the door by a hostess who promptly seated us. She cheerfully told us our waiter would be with us shortly. We sat and reviewed the menu, chatted, waited, and waited, and waited. No one came to take a beverage order, no one came to say hi, no one even looked our way. After waiting 20 minutes, one of us got up and went back to the hostess station to let her know that no one has been by to take our order, let alone ask us if anyone wanted coffee, juice, etc. She apologized and said she would \" go find our server\"  We waited an additional 10 minutes ( we timed it) and still no server came. We decided to leave. The restaurant was not busy and we saw several staff members standing together chatting. The table next to us commented on how horrible the service was and that we were better off leaving anyways. Great recommendation.....we only wish they would have told us that when we first sat down! As we were leaving, the hostess said \"thanks for visiting us\" . We told her what had happened and she said \"oh well, have a great day anyways\"  Frustrated by this experience, I e-mailed their corporate office to make them aware of our issues. No response from them. If they don't care about my complaint, I don't care to ever go to their establishment again. Haven't returned, nor will I....nor will the other three people with me. I teach a customer service class and now use this visit as a lesson on how poor service and poor recovery response can impact your business. 4 unhappy customers who will never return and who advise others of the same when asked about his restaurant."}
{"text":"Three of my friends and I went there for lunch one Saturday and, only three words can describe this restaurant: GROSS, GROSS, GROSS!  We walked in off street level and the upstairs area kind of smelled like a dirty dish cloth.  Why we didn't leave is because one of my friends was craving the mussels.  Anyway, we ended up sitting downstairs in a booth.  When I went to walk to the bathroom to wash my hands, I noticed that my flip-flops were kind of sticking to the floor.  When I went back to the booth, that dirty dish cloth smell keep coming on and then disappearing.  We all noticed it but by that time they had already brought our drinks.    I ordered the corn beef on rye with fries and coleslaw - bread seemed like it was sitting out for a while, coleslaw was disgusting and fries were cold; waiter brought new fries though.  One of my friends ordered the mussels and she had to send them back because some parts were cold, like just came out of the fridge cold.  When the new order came, they were very gritty as if they weren't washed properly.  In return for her dreadful lunch, she was given a free\" appetizer\" gift card that had a 30-day expiration date.  The waiter was really nice and seemed a bit embarrassed.  My other two friends said there meals were alright but they wouldn't hurry back for a return visit, especially due to that smell.  It's unfortunate because, we went to the Pickle Barrel at Finch and Leslie at least once a week when we were growing up and it was always amazing.  It doesn't say a lot for Toronto as I can see a lot of tourists stopping in for lunch, given the location."}
{"text":"****UNBELIEVEABLE!!!!*Second time and last time I am ordering from here I have order off uber eats twice and both times I have and for extra dressing for my salad and extra sauce for my foood and both times I have not received it... I called right away each time and asked to speak to a manager and both times I was left on hold for over 20 mins which after I just hung up because that's just ridiculous! And I have also left my number with the girl at the front so I can have a manager call me back but that has yet to happen.... it's unfortunate for the business to loose money and customers just because u people just don't want to do your job... honestly very disappointing cause the food is good but the customer serious is absolutely SHIT.."}
{"text":"HUGE selection.  Good prices. Good food. Only complaint was our server should have a picture on a milk carton...he was missing for most of our meal. Also, the french fries were undercooked.  How hard should it be to get a crisp fry?"}
{"text":"After getting that cold \"it'll be an hour and a half to two hours\" to get a table at The Keg, the Pickle Barrel with only a 15 Mon wait was a nice alternative. I have nothing against new locations of The Keg being busy but a hostess with a little sympathy just always feels better. Sorry Keg!  The Pickle Barrel has one of the most creative menus I've seen. What seems to be a page taken from The Cheesecake Factory menu, PB has something for everyone. And to start it off, the hostess is way friendlier that the people at The Keg. She was sympathetic to our request for a booth and seated us within 15 mins as originally promised.   The interior has a number of areas that are secluded from each other. We had a booth in the back. Nicole our server was awesome.....unpretentious, not pushy and always around. Great service.   The menu is filled with appetizers, meat and seafood, pasta, Mexican and healthy \"bowls\". We had the Kung Pao, Kung Pao, and the Paella. Both were excellent. They have a number of desserts from small tasters to calorie filled goodness.   Prior to this visit, it had been a while since I was last at the Pickle Barrel and after this visit, I'm sure I'll be back. I also like the concept with a quick service counter at the front of the restaurant. We'll done!"}
{"text":"The Pickle Barrel is standard fare in the GTA. They are reliable, the food is typically decent, and the servers are nice. The one at Yonge and Dundas faces a lot of competition just because of its location but I've been back there several times and it's always good. I went here most recently after attending a panel at Ryerson. I got fish and sweet potato fries. The fish was good, but the sweet potato fries were really yummy, especially with the chipotle aioli. The coleslaw had too much vinegar. My friend had chicken fingers I believe which was as usual good. Not much to say here, it's a really no frills place but that's probably a good thing considering all the crappy options in the area. If you just want something quick and tasty, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Good service and food was good dollar value. Server was friendly and efficient. Ordered a salad that was HUGE. Which is nice to see Asante places charge the same for half as much. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Friday Night with our best friends at the Sherway Gardens location which was attached to the mall.  Here are the Pros: Our waiter Sunny was attentive to us when we needed him.  he was there to get us anything we needed.  The mushroom burger tasted pretty good.  The beef patty was soft, a litle juicy, and the condiments were fresh and crisp.  Afterwards, we got the Molten Lava Cake Sundae which was absolutely delish!  Excellent flavour and not terribly sweet.  The cake was warm and moist and when you got to the bottom of the glass, flavour was nice and ice cold.  I definitely recommend this dessert.  Here are the Cons: Sunny, the waiter smelled like cigarette smoke at times.  It was kinda gross but we dealt with it.  When I upgraded my side fries to sweet potato fries for an extra charge I was excited. It arrived and it was pretty horrible.  The fries were burnt-ish and the taste was dry.  Not worth switching it for the charge.  Definitely a great experience and soothing ambiance."}
{"text":"Good normal class restaurant. Good service, fair prices and good variety on menu. Nothing fancy but pretty good."}
{"text":"Nice, higher end casual, with lots of TV's showing the Canucks game lose to the Hawks, yay.  Considering the students around here, perhaps why cheap Corona's for just $5 last nite and because of the ratings here, wasn't in the mood for food.  2 rounds, we were done :)  cool tables with built in light inside.  Seating in the back as it is quite narrow with escalators going down.  Ok service."}
{"text":"Either you love Pickle Barrel or you hate it.  I've always loved it, but my friends who didn't grow up with it hate it.  It's yummy, and the menu is HUGE.  I used to go here all the time back in the day, but now that I'm a \"foodie\" we don't really go here.  If you go, I'd recommend getting the focaccia, so delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been to Pickle Barrel a couple of times and my experience has been really great or just down right WTF.  However this time around, I'm giving it a 4 stars! woohoo!  SERVICE BRAD IS DA BOMB! My server Brad made sure our evening was delightful.   - He was always there when we needed him - he never pushed us into ordering faster - he let us stay as long as we wanted 3.5hrs on a Thursday night (keep in mind we had 10 ppl who kept ordering drinks, food, dessert, drinks) - he was very flexible with our receipts, fast with taking our orders and delivering our food. and so much more!  FOOD I just ate a dessert b/c by the time I'm finished with my meal, I can't even begin to think about dessert. My dessert was $4.99 for this fairly big cup of ice cream with brownies and oreos. delicious.  But what was fantastic was that Pickle Barrel allows you to bring your own cakes w/o charging you additional fees and so of course I brought my home made cake for my friend for her b-day.  Brad was so kind to put it in the fridge for us and give us additional plates and cutlery at the end of our meal (prolonging our time using the tables).  BOOTHS What I liked best is the layout of the restaurant. It felt like we were in our own little room/booth and so we didn't hear other ppl's conversation.  What I found a bit ridiculous was that my friend received a phone call from Pickle Barrel and the women on the phone (who sounded a bit peeved said\" \"I'm sorry, but your reservation has been cancelled b/c you and your guests are not here\" but in fact we were sitting at our table already ordering.  When we told her, she was like \"oh...sorry\"."}
{"text":"This location should change their tag line from \"Always Fresh\" to \"Dog Food for Humans\" because that is exactly what you'd get! Just like Fido thinks he's gonna get a juicy chicken thigh and some turkey breast as promised by the outside of his 20lb bag of chow, YOU would think (THINK) that you're going to get something that LOOKS like what's on the menu? NOPE!   I must confess, I'm the one to blame here for agreeing to step foot in this sorry excuse of a \"restaurant\". I ordered their Swiss cheese burger thinking ... they can't f*k that up can they? and sure enough! the kitchen crew came right through! with flying colors! With two patties that looked like gandhi's flip flops recently recovered from an abandoned ashram being demolished and deep fried in rancid oil for \"extra tasty you know!\"   If you take the gigantic onion ring off the burger, you're left with two disgusting, triple fried, frozen, then refried, then left to fester under the lamp for 30 minutes patties that make McDonald's cheezburger patties look like a million bucks!   That is what you have to contend with when you have a director who was born without taste buds and who - in a final humiliation for the year - insists that he take the whole team to this garbage dump for a \"holiday lunch\".  Yes I ate that garbage, because I wanted to know how neglected pooches feel when they eat dollar store dog food. Because I was so hungry after a 45 minutes wait that I could've eaten my own scarf. Because this place has a kitchen staffed by hamsters who were recruited to cook since humans refuse to cook here (apparently.)  And this is a note to the poor soul who has to reply to every negative comment and feign sympathy with promises of \"passing this along to our kitchen improvement team.\" SAVE IT. You're transparent, and you're lucky you have a job as are the arseholes \"cooking\" in the dundas sq location. You should all be fired and another mcdonalds should be opened here because at least my disappointment at McDonalds is consistent and manageable.  DO not eat here out of your own free will. You've been warned."}
{"text":"I've been to many pickle barrels over the years.  It was a treat for me in my twenties and thirties.  This location has stood for a very long time.  I've eaten there frequently in the past.  I have not eaten at the pickle barrel as often since going on a gluten free diet.  They have gone out of their way at each location to make sure that I have something to eat.  I had a bacon cheeseburger wrapped in lettuce with some very nice fried onions.  The side vegetables were water logged and bland looking.  I was happy with the burger, but the presentation wasn't great.  The vegetables served with it did not look appetizing.    The staff was not really attentive.  Granted it was late, but it was not one of the better experiences that I have had.  This location has fantastic appetizing desserts that looked fantastic.  I remember them well.  It was clean, but this visit was a little lacking.  I'm sure that on a different day that the visit would have been different, but it wasn't a visit that I will cherish."}
{"text":"I've been to the Pickle Barrel a couple of times in the past but today's visit wasn't impressive at all.  Me and my sister arrived for dinner on a Thursday evening. We thought we were gonna get decent service since there weren't many people. It took about 10 minutes for our server to come by and take our orders. We ordered the spaghetti with meatballs, honey garlic chicken wings, and lobster and jumbo shrimp in angel hair. The appetizer didn't take too long to arrive and it tasted decent. However, they were so tiny and are definitely not worth $9.99 for 8 tiny wings. When we finished the wings it took about 30 minutes for the main course to arrive. We were not impressed with the slow service especially when the restaurant is barely full. The spaghetti and meatballs were nothing special...I liked the pasta much more than the meatballs. My sister didn't like her angel hair dish and was a tad jealous that I ordered spaghetti.  It looks like we're not going here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today the service for once was amazing as was the food . No complaints at all def will come back"}
{"text":"My recent email to Pickle Barrel Management, that of course, went unanswered:   Dear Pickle Barrel Management,   I wanted to let you know of a recent experience I had at one of your restaurants while out with my fiancé.   I was recently at your downtown Toronto location (Yonge and Dundas) at 9pm. The experience left a lot to be desired. I hadn't been to that location for approximately two years, and I was disappointed to find out how much this location has deteriorated in terms of service, aesthetics and general menu.   Our server did not introduce herself, and did not tell us about your apparently new (limited time?) taco menu. My fiancé and I ordered the PEI mussels to start (always a favourite), and 1lb steak fajitas to share.   We still had an entire bowl of mussels when the main course arrived approximately five minutes later. The mussels were good as they normally are, but were not served with your usual bread. The waitress told us that the bread is no longer served with mussels or even pasta, a small detail, but affecting enjoyment nonetheless.   The steak for the fajitas was overcooked and flavourless. The size of the accompaniments was not appropriate for the amount of steak that we received.   The meal was lacklustre. When we asked for fresh side plates for our fajitas since the two we were given were covered in the mussel sauce, our waitress acted surprised, as though she didn't understand our request. She reluctantly returned with some plates. She then left our empty plates covered in mussel shells until after we received our bill, on what was already a crowded table. The washrooms were in disarray--wet, and missing soap in two dispensers. We noticed a waitress who was handling a stacked trolley of old food, and someone's dessert at the same time.   I in no way wish to get our waitress into trouble or reprimanded. The events were not her fault. It's clear that the standards of the entire restaurant have slipped. Our waitress was not doing anything different than the other members of your serving staff that we observed. That's your problem right there. As a consumer, this makes me wonder whether my experience is an outlier and that this particular location is subpar (although this would be mind boggling since this is your flagship location), or whether the entire chain has slid to low standards.   So, will we be back at Pickle Barrel? Probably not. If we want a nicer chain feeling, we'll stick to Joey or Jack Astor's or some other place down the street."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  It's basically what you'd expect.  A little pricey but good food.  I had the turkey burger.  Too much bread for my taste and I would have liked the fries a little crisper, but it was still good."}
{"text":"It's sad to say but this place is going downhill....came here after exams and oh boy I wish I went to red lobster instead because not only did this place suck but I got diarrhea after my meal......so yea if ur constipated then head on over to this pickle barrel otherwise stay away!!!!!! I ordered the mini burgers and it just looked like it was a regular burger with the meat cut up into quarters....our waiter was terrible, she spilled sour cream all over the floor right beside our table and didnt even bother cleaning it up Good bye pickle barrel, u earned my last dollar"}
{"text":"It sure is a pickle barrel.  Ultimately it's slightly over priced for what it is, but it comes with a slice of pickle.  That's what people like right?  Sadly my sandwich arrived without said pickle.  And having asked about its location I was told it would soon arrive, but still it did not.  Finally before the bill many pickles showed up.  Not a whole barrel of pickles, but still a great number.  Sadly, at that point there was no room for pickles in my belly.  It was a tragedy."}
{"text":"Can awful service ruin a restaurant?  Yes, and this is a prime example.  The location is right, the food is good, there are mouth watering desserts on display but the execution of the service there is a complete failure.  I have been to Pickel Barrel twice since they've renovated it.  There were a few hostesses but it looked like they were getting off duty and the manager was asking them to stay and they had a little dispute about whether the hostess should have stayed.  Both the manager, off-duty hostess and the on-duty hostess did not give a rats arse about my friend and I who was just standing there.  We just left and went somewhere else.  The second time, we made it into a seat.  My boyfriend ordered the king crab and steak combo and I ordered a salad.  The waitress said that they were discontinuing the king crab and would go check with the cooks.  She came back and told us that there was king crab, so he ordered the king crab with steak combo.    It was not until I got my salad entree that she came and told him that there was actually no king crab!  My friend said fine, I'll just order something else.  He decided to ordered a larger cut of steak, but the server said that he MUST take the steak that was supposed to come with the crab because it was already cooked.  So the waitress forced him to take the steak that was already made and substitute something else for the king crab.  And... his entree did not come out until I finished mine.  When his entree came out, they also served his starters (salad and something else) at the same time.  Did I mention that the steak was cold at this point?  So half the time we were just watching each other eat.  Terrible experience."}
{"text":"It was Black Friday. Hustle and bustle in Eaton's Centre and all the restaurants. My wife and myself decided to eat at Pickle Barrel since all the other restaurants were even more overrun with people. The wait was shorter than was told. The service was prompt, efficient  and very polite. I ordered the Fish and Chips and my wife ordered the harvest bowl. My wife thought the harvest bowl was made with quinoa and not rice, and the waitress was nice enough to offer to redo the dish with quinoa. Totally unexpected and yet a welcomed experience. I continued to enjoy the fish and chips. Till I reached the bottom of my meal only did I discover a LONG STRAND OF HAIR!..My wife stopped eating and decided to box and carry out the remainder of her barely eaten dinner. The experience was fantastic up to that point. Needless to say I was not charged for my meal, and I paid the bill with a well deserved tip for the waitress.   I've been eating in Pickle Barrel for many many years with my wife. I'm now reluctant to return from this experience. I'm hoping the reputation of the restaurant has not tarnished, but certainly has in my mind. This was just one location and someday, if my wife and myself have a craving, we will consider to return to another Pickle Barrel."}
{"text":"The service at this location is so bad it's ridiculous. I guess I should commend them for their consistency... It must take a lot of effort to provide such inadequate service all the time.   Not only does it take a while to get seated (doesn't matter what time you go). If you are in a rush, or moderately hungry do not come here.   We ordered our food and then our server Amy disappeared. I had to get up and look for our server because 30 mins had passed and we still did not get our appetizer.   Pretty much don't bother with such a mediocre place. There's a lot of food places in the area, you're better off going there."}
{"text":"Hangover Sunday and was booked to have brunch with the B.F's family at the Pickle Barrel.  Desperately I clung to the belief that I might slide free of this commitment but no such luck...  Barely afloat in a sea of screaming children and mewing moms, I made my way through a menu as thick Crime and Punishment.  I will give the P.B credit, if options are what you need this place has it.  In other words, Pickle Barrel knows it's audience -- the family -- and caters to it.  The menu has numerous salads for the slimmers, chicken fingers galore for the growers, sandwiches, burgers, wraps, omelets (with egg whites if requested), latkes, soups, desserts, pasta etc.  It is not a traditional deli in any sense, they even used processed meats.  This my friends is not a fine dining establishment; it is a place that you go to with your children that gives you license to give the finger to your neighbour if they look at your whining child reproachfully.  Pickle Barrel is decent, large, and knows what it's up against."}
{"text":"I was kind of nervous to eat here after I looked at Yelp. Unfortunately I sat down here to eat before checking Yelp. After my experience I realized the overall rating doesn't do this place justice.  It has a cool vibe to it for what I assume is a chain restaurant. The top floor has a bar and some tvs giving it an upscale sports bar feel and you take the escalator down to the restaurant.  The hostess was so nice. I wish I would have gotten her name to put in the review.  I was then greeted by my server who took my drink order. My meal consisted of an app: fried pickles and a meal: the Cali chicken club.  The fried pickles were amazing. I could have used more ranch dipping sauce.  The Cali club: a chicken breast with avocado and red pepper on a thick pieces of bread. I liked the sandwich but didn't love the pepper with it. They either should remove it cut the pepper into thinner slices. It was too thick for the sandwich. The sandwich also came with fries.  Service was ok. The waitress would kind of disappear. Felt like it was a little difficult to get her attention or maybe she was reluctant to refill my drinks. Do they not like giving refills in Canada ? Service was a low point of the overall experience but still not terrible.  Coming back to Canada would I stop here? Maybe. I would consider it, yes. It was an ok experien"}
{"text":"Stopped in here with a friend for some appetizers and drinks. Not too busy during our time there (roughly 4:30pm) and we say in the bar section off to the side at a high-top table. Very comfortable, clean and our server acknowledged us rather quickly and took care of us throughout our time there. Had drinks and apps. The Poutine and The Asian Nachos. Both were great and just the right amount of food before moving on to the next destination. The restaurant is located in a great section of the city---right downtown near everything. The Eaton Centre is within walking distance, Massey Hall is close by, as well as tons of other shopping and drinking establishments."}
{"text":"I'll agree with Melissa, Pickle Barrel is overrated.  And a warning to the herbivores, a lot of what appear to be innoncuous items on the menu are not vegetarian-friendly.  A friend who worked here as a waitress told me that the pastas are cooked in animal broth.  Don't bother if you're going meat-free."}
{"text":"This is a late review as I've been quite lazy. My apologies but I can't sat it won't happen again.  So a couple of weeks ago my mom and shopping partner in crime decided to go for our bi-weekly visit to Vaughan Mills. And of course, we were hungry so we decided on the Pickle Barrel for lunch. Always a good choice, in my opinion, and we do like this location. As it wasn't very busy we were seated quickly and the server asked for our drink order within minutes of us settling in. Nothing fancy though, a gingerale for myself and a coke for my mother. For the meal i ordered the maple trout with mashed root veggies and roasted veggies. My mom had the fish and chips. The trout was delicious. I thought the maple syrup would make it too sweet but it was perfect. Just a hint, enough to remind you that there was in fact maple syrup. The mashed veg was creamy and the roasted veggies crunchy. Rarely can I ever finish a meal but I cleaned the plate. My mom's go-to is always the fish and chips, and I'll admit to having a bite. My only complaint is I find they use too much batter, but other than that, both meals were enjoyed. With our bellies full it was time to shop till we dropped (not really). However, the Pickle Barrel is one of 2 sit down restaurants in the mall and not a bad choice if you're feeling peckish."}
{"text":"I  been here a few times, mainly when I'm down town and don't want to get ripped off for food. Most restaurants in the area are extremely overpriced and rip you off just because they're in the heart of the city, the pickle barrel doesn't fair food for a fair price. The servings are a good size and the price is good. Every time I've gone service has been stellar, they're always polite and quick with our orders. Normally I order the sausage rigatoni the sausage is good quality and tasty.  This isn't a 5 star restaurant, don't expect it to be. People tend not to expect to much for their money if you want a 5 star meal good by a world class chef your gonna have to pay for it else where but if you're just looking for a good quick meal in the downtown core this is your place to go."}
{"text":"I visited the Pickle Barrel when I was on a work trip in the Toronto area.  I ordered a peach bellini and the berry crunch bowl.  Turns out the bellini was frozen (I'm not a fan of frozen drinks) but that was my fault for not reading the description closely.  It was very tasty (and big!) though.  The berry crunch bowl was terrific.  A little heavy on the carrots but I'd definitely order it again."}
{"text":"I hate how people insist on going here when there are so many better options in the area. I went again, yesterday, and I feel robbed.  I can't tell you how many times I've been here - but what I can tell you is that this location is dark, drab, and they do not know how to cook red meat. Dry and over cooked every. single. time.   Do not attempt to order any \"thai\" or \"chinese\" food - lean cuisine does a better job at capturing international flavours.   If you go here, keep it simple. Wraps, sandwiches, breakfast. By the way, I used to go to the locations in Markham and Yorkdale, years ago with my mom and I really enjoyed it. I'm beginning to wonder if it is just this location, or if Pickle Barrel's quality has gone down in the past few years.  Oh, PS - if you order a sandwich and want to sub onion rings for fries, it is an extra $3.99 and you get 6 onion rings."}
{"text":"The funny story was about 1 year ago when we went there for dinner and ordered fajitas. I mean, we love Pickle Barrel (they have the good Borscht and fajitas) but this time the lettuce for fajitas were looking very bad and old. They were not fresh at all, kind of brown. So when the manager came to our table, we showed him the lettuce and he was like \"It looks okay, no big deal.\" So we asked him if he would eat it. He took it in his fingers, looked at it and said \"Yes, I would\". We almost couldn't believe it, we even took a picture of that salad, as it looked so gross. There are better Pickle Barrels around us."}
{"text":"The food is nothing special, but it was not bad. I emphasize that because my previous experience at Pickle Barrel a decade ago was not good. As such, I have not been back. I had their Smoked Meat sandwich with marbled bread and fries and the meat was surprisingly A-OK. The fries were boring and the marbled bread not the best or the freshest perhaps. The portions were just right.  The service was slow at first. It was lunch and we were rearing to go and it took them some time to take our orders, but when they did the food arrived quickly. There was a service check and the waiter was pleasant. The dining room looked updated and clean and thankfully (for us) they were not too busy even though they are located in a mall, namely Sherway Gardens. Four people including tax $100."}
{"text":"I came here for a dinner on a weekday a couple weeks ago, entering from the inner mall entrance. It wasn't busy. The person working at the front said hi, but that's all he said. We waited for about 15 seconds and when he paid no more attention to us, we walked in a bit further, assuming we would have to sit ourselves. Probably 20 steps in, he followed us, and asked us where we would like to sit.   We got a booth table and I ordered Nachos, Lychee Lemonade and a Hummus Wrap. The hummus wrap is my favourite dish at Pickle Barrel relative to the other overly priced items. When I got my drink, I took probably 10 sips before I REALLY looked at it and saw a dead fruit fly inside. When the server came by, I showed him the fly and in disbelief, he took it to the back. When he came back, he said \"it was only a fruit fly,\" but would give me another drink. ONLY a fruit fly? I was appalled. So the next time he came over, I asked him what the restaurant would do for me due to having already drunken from their infested drink. He had to go see the manager, who then came by and told us the appetizer would be on the house. So, good for the manager for rectifying the situation.   I found my server quite annoying throughout the night. I was seeing a friend whom I haven't seen in a long time and he kept coming by and asked about our lives such as which school we went to, what we were studying, etc. When I have a good server, they don't ask these type of questions. More like, \"how is your dinner going?\", \"are you doing anything later in the night?\", etc. Our server was borderline annoying."}
{"text":"I love this place for the location, and most importantly the health-concious menu. Rarely (and I use that word loosely - more like never) will you find a menu in Toronto that includes calorie count per serving, but also TASTES GOOD and FILLS YOU UP.  Rose's menu of healthy-portioned, calorie-wise choices are a great option for someone who wants to eat out, but also doesn't want to jepordize their waistline. My favourite is the sun-dried tomato burger (no bun!) w/ smashed potatoes, delish! And the Spanish Paella is a dream, chock-full of chicken, shrimp and sausuage (I choose not to order it with mussels) amazingly flavourful but not overly spicy. It's hard to believe something that hearty is that low-cal. Being able to eat well and feel full, and know that you didn't just consume the calories of a small family's entire dinner makes me a fan.  That said, on my non-calorie counting nights, the menu is fairly large and diverse. The restuarant (chain) is also one of the few in the city that serves Hoegarrden. I only recommend ordering beer, no cocktails! Their cocktails are horrendously oversized, yet still only come with 1- 1.5oz of booze. Meaning if you're craving a margarita, what comes to the table is a big 'ol bowl of syrup and ice."}
{"text":"PB Vaughan Mills has gone down hill lately.  The last few times I gone (during week and yesterday a Saturday) the floors were dirty with straws and other garbage.  No utensils on the table and I had to find a server after my meal was served to get some and so did the family beside us! Their mixed drinks are not consistent at the bar.  The Bellini my wife ordered yesterday came in the wrong glass with no garnishes and tasted horrible.  In the past they usually did a great job.  The food was okay at least."}
{"text":"Good place to eat in a convenient location and there are rarely long wait times for tables. My friends and I used to frequent the place, and while the food isn't spectacular enough to rave over, I enjoy the killer milkshakes and the lava cake dessert.  In my experience I've tried the following menu items: Thai fried cauliflower (5/5) Crispy calamari (4/5) The P.B. House burger (4/5) Santa Fe bowl (5/5) Wild mushroom gnocchi (5/5) Fried chicken and waffles (5/5) Chocolate molten lava cake (5/5) Killer milkshake (5/5)  All in all, it's a decent restaurant and I will probably be visiting again in the future."}
{"text":"I always eat here when I visit Vaughan Mills. I love their deep fried pickles and burgers, even though I'm not a huge burger fan! The service is average, nothing that will make me tip extra, but not poor enough for me to feel disatisfied. The outside patio is nice during the summer! They also make decent Ceasers! This may sound weird but the bathrooms at PB are FANCY!!"}
{"text":"Wow! this location is not like any Pickle Barrel I ever remember visiting! The atmosphere in this particular location is part of what puts this review at 5 stars! Other positives for this visit were the service and the food! It doesn't hurt this review that the company was good!  First of all the decor - this is no diner! It does not look like a deli in any way! I expected an open kitchen (picture Nate's diner in Ottawa, if you can), but this was not to be seen. It's a little dark inside with dark floors and tables, and everywhere you look, it is very clean (and yes, this includes the restrooms!) There's a bar to one side to which they cater to a lively evening trade, and I believe they have entertainment on the weekends. It would be very inviting and could be a little romantic. A romantic Pickle Barrel?? I know! Who knew? I can imagine recouping your energy here, after a hard day of shoping! I'm in for that!!  Secondly, the service and the food: the menu is roughly as expected for this chain of restaurants although it has been updated since last I went. That's fine - 'ya gotta keep up with the times! But here they seem to have broadened the menu a bit to include lunch and dinner. I like it! The service was terrific: there for you but not in your face. It wasn't meshugah-crazy busy but there were other diners.   We got great service, and great food that was invitingly placed on the plate and very palatable. I would certainly come back."}
{"text":"Is it odd that I go to Pickle Barrel, but I always get the same thing? I LOOOOOVE their club house on an onion bun. I've had their crab cakes a few times recently and they've been decent.  This location is pretty big, and pushes the people through pretty well. You can still wander a few nearby stores if you are not seated right away.  Service is pretty quick and standard. Never been knocked out, never been disappointed.  Pickle Barrel is probably dreading the expansion of Sherway Gardens with 4 new restaurants."}
{"text":"When we arrived, there was a lineup, but it was cleared very quickly. The first table they sat us at had a very wet floor, so they apologized and quickly sat us down at a different table. The washroom is truly hands-free....well except you have to touch the pump to get soap. A wave of hand is what you need to open the door to the washrooms. Our waitress was friendly and gave good recommendations. We were just a little disappointed with the presentation. We ordered two apps (Luau Chicken and Honey Garlic Chicken Wings) and a main course (Beef and Mushroom). The chicken wings were right on, but the Luau was nothing like the picture from the menu....actually close to unappetizing, and the taste was nothing exciting. Here's the most disappointing part. The luau came at the same time as our main course. It is not because it took that long to come out. We JUST finished the wings, and our server came back with both. Why did the kitchen fire the main course so early? Why did our server bring it out? The main ended up was just sitting there while we felt like rushing our app just so that we won't be eating a cold main. The saving grace of our meal would be the Mammoth Oreo Cookie. It was simply mm-mm good."}
{"text":"Terrible. I got the pulled pork sandwich. It was so sweet and had this aftertaste that guarantied that it was chemically based - although the fact it was bright highlighter orange was a hint. Never ever going back!"}
{"text":"I went here with a few friends before I had to take the Megabus back to Buffalo. The waiter was snobby and rude. He rolled his eyes at us after we ordered. He was impatient with us when we asked questions. We ordered Barrel fries, chicken and hummus wrap, and a salmon dish. The fries were stale. Definitely will never order their fries again. The chicken and hummus wrap was OK. I have had better. The balsamic vinaigrette that came with the salad was bland. I had a piece of the salmon, which was delicious. The salmon was cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"There was a time when the Pickle Barrel brand stood for more than so-so food. That time is passed at least a decade ago."}
{"text":"I came here with a group a while back, and I had very high expectations after amazing experiences at some of the other well managed franchises under the same name.The place is clean, and has a huge amount of seating but it's very dark, so pictures don't come out well, especially if you're on the lower level. Cell phone service for some providers WILL cut in and out, so stick to text messages or organize ahead of time.  The food is great, but priced a bit higher based on the quality and portion sizes.I ended up having a greek salad with  fish and chips. I couldn't help feel that the fish was probably freezer burned, being very tough under the delicious fried batter. If you're going in to host a birthday party, bring your own cake, they tried to charge us $80 for a mediocre cake, so we sent someone up the street and got one for $14.  If you decide to have a small group or something festive, be prepared ahead of time and you'll be alright"}
{"text":"This was by far my worst dining experience to date.  I went for dinner here with a few friends after long exam (BScN registration exit exam) on November 28th.  To begin, we waited for 15 minutes without being seated - no line, but no staff could have been bothered to have seated us at the several open/clean tables available.  We were then passed over and the hostess seated the two women who arrived 10 minutes after us at a table that could have held our group.  After finally being seated we then waited for another 10-15 minutes with no waiter, no drinks, nothing.  We finally re-approached the hostess desk to inquire about the whereabouts of our waiter - so the hostess came and took our drink orders, along with our food orders (she was pleasant and professional).  Our drinks arrived by our supposed waiter (who never introduced himself).  35 minutes later our food had still not arrived, and we had planned to see a movie of which we were going to be late for.  We again (having not seen our heard from our waiter) went to the desk and explained that we may have to leave as we were not going to be able to wait for our food and eat it in time due to the delay.  The hostess/manager then promptly apologized and got our food from the kitchen.  We then consumed our food in 5-7 minutes flat to ensure we would make the movie on time.  Our waiter finally decided to come to our table when we asked somebody else for the bill.  Our waiter was unprofessional, and did not ever apologize or even acknowledge our experience.  After we had all paid he then asked how old we are - guessing high school aged. We shook our heads and he proceeded to rudely remark that we must all be in elementary school.  I am 23 years old, and we are all in our final year of our fourth year nursing degree.    Do not go here, and if you get a server called Abba request a different server to ensure that you actually receive service.  I don't know that I will ever return to this location after this, and will let others know of my experience."}
{"text":"Went here for Saturday night dinner.   It was, as per usual, the boyfriend and I.   We ordered a three course meal: appetizer, main & dessert - no drinks. The bill came to approximately $50.   Appetizer: Maryland Crab Cakes Score: 3.5/5 The portion size can use a little bulking up. They are very delicious but they're really dinky & flat. I think the chefs could add a little more crab meat. Their choice of a kind of chipotle mayo is good but seems to be the only sauce they use for their fried seafood.   My main: Steak Diane Score: 1/5 This was a terrible dish to choose. I mean, the portion size was an eye popper but the taste did not match. The sauce was bland and the meat was not seasoned and had a funny metallic taste. The only redeeming thing on this plate were the potatoes!   His main: Spanish Paella  Score: 3.5/5  His dish was alright, it was a little bit over sauced and it made the rice really soggy. I've had it there where it wasn't soggy but there is a lack of consistency at Pickle Barrel. Anyway, the portion size was a generous serving.   Dessert: Jenny's Homemade Tiramisu Score: 3/5  It comes in a large martini glass & I think it's a good helping of it. I think it can do without the strawberries. Does tiramisu come in that variation? I don't think strawberries are a good mix in this & it looks like strawberries are a bowl filler rather than using more of the whipped cream & other (I think) regular tiramisu ingredients.   Service: 2.5/5  The server didn't come by often to check on us & refill water. I had asked about a seafood item on the menu & her reply was \"I don't know, I don't eat fish, I'm a vegetarian.\" Ok great, I don't care, then find someone who can give me some information about the item, like a better response would have been \"I am unsure because I am a vegetarian, but I can ask another server.\" I absolutely disliked her quick shut down to my question because she does not eat the items I am inquiring about. Terrible.   I also noticed that this kind of unprofessionalism is quite rampant at this location. This woman, she wasn't walking around in a server uniform, was telling servers to do certain duties & then one server, a younger girl started going off about the manager looking woman to another male server... & I mean GOING OFF \"That f** b** she's crazy! She does this this this & that that that (obviously I didn't understand everything she was saying) - who does that?! She's f** crazy!\" & this server was doing this while other guests are around & in an area that was not discrete at all.   Our bill came to approximately $50 after tax for a three course meal, no drinks.    I can tell you we did not tip well.   I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone anymore. It used to be good in terms of service and food quality consistency but somewhere it fell off. I am not surprised as the level of professionalism is pretty much non-existent.   Overall I give this place a 2/5."}
{"text":"From reading a few other review's of this spot it seems to be hit or miss!  I'm feeling lucky that my visit last night was a hit! Service was fast quick and easy! Usually I have to wait around for what feels like a BILLION years for water at other Pickle Barrels, but here is didn't have to even do the little wavy-flag over-point at cup maneuver! I loved my soup of the day, butternut squash (YUM!), and enjoyed my chicken quesadilla (sp?).  It is a Pickle Barrel so obviously you're not expecting the best of the best or anything, but all in all it lived up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Calamari: Just fine.  Baja Fish Tacos: Very good.  Mushroom Swiss Burger: So-so, nothing to write home about.  Shrimp and Lobster Linguini: Tasted like butter. Shrimp overdone. Not good.  Double Stack Chicken: Pretty good, excellent portion. Service: Very Pleasant, but slow despite not there being a lot of patrons on an Easter Sunday."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place because of the size of their menu.  We started out with the wonton nachos.  They were to DIE for.  So tasty!  This made us excited for our entree.  I ordered the grilled cheese and my friend ordered the grilled cheese with bacon (her bacon was beyond raw).  If I went by the bomb-factor of the nachos, the grilled cheese should have been the best one I've ever tasted....but....twas not.  It was the nastiest, most dry, bland piece of shit I've ever eaten.  Seriously.  It's like they found some bread that had fallen behind the stove, got some gross processed american cheese from the corner mart and slapped it all together and charged me 7 bucks.  They didn't even butter the bread.  C'mon now!  What a sad meal it was.  I'm hesitant to say I wouldn't go back because the nachos kicked so much ass.  Just stay away from the grilled cheese!"}
{"text":"First off I must say I really like the decor and atmosphere of the newer Pickle Barrel locations.   I have always found the staff here friendly enough, but not exceeding any expectations. The food is pretty average, the deli sandwiches are pretty good, but I've had bigger and better in the same price range.   They always seem to carry whatever marketing specials their suppliers have on, I've received a Steam Whistle 1L boot glass, and 1L ceramic stein here, which I'm sure is a draw for extra customers.    This particular evening we were sat in a corner, round booth that was very private as the walls of the booth were padded and go right up to the ceiling, felt as though no one else could hear us, although I'm not sure if that was actually the case."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times and I've usually come away satisfied. Not amazed, but not like I had wasted my money.   Personally, I feel that the Pickle Barrel is really just a larger Kelsey's with a bigger & better menu. The food was fairly delicious, but nothing particularly fresh tasting. I've had good service and I've had slow and unfriendly service.   I'm sure this place could be something quite amazing if they simply were a little pickier on who they hired as staff, and upped the quality of their meals, but I don't think they'll ever have that need.  For now, it remains an ol' faithful when you want a nicer version of Kelseys."}
{"text":"This Pickle Barrel is located in the Atrium across from the Eaton Centre near the north west corner of Yonge and Dundas. This particular location is a Pickle Barrel Grand (if I'm not mistaken) and has a huge menu and a very large dining room with a bar on the upper level.  I've had some bad experiences at this particular location but my coworker suggested it for lunch so I figured I'd give it another try. The menu here is huge and daunting. Do yourself a favor and check it out in advance of coming. For those of you on a diet, avoid this place at all costs. Very few if any dishes come in under 500 calories and the sodium is off the charts.  That being said, they do have some tasty food here. This time around I had the turkey burger with brie. It was tasty but it fell apart as I was eating it and it became a fork and knife kind of experience. I had sweet potato fries on the side and while they were kind of boring, the spicy chipotle mayo they served with it was tasty. The grilled cheese here is a simple but super tasty dish I've had many times, and the club is also very good. The chicken fingers are on par with other restaurants and the drinks here (alcoholic ones) are very tasty.  One thing to beware of here is the potentially slowwwwwwww service. I've never had slower or more laid back service anywhere compared to here. Servers take their time with everything, so if you're looking for a quick lunch, get takeout or go to the food court. I've had lunch here before and it was a two hour affair, not because we wanted to stay but because our server disappeared and no one else would get our bill.  Overall, a decent restaurant that needs to step up its service. They did well this time and I'll come back again to see if they can get me in and out in an hour for a lunch break!"}
{"text":"It's typically a mixed bag when I go to this location of PB. I've had many bad experiences and a few ok experiences. We've had poor tasting food and bad service. The last time we decided to only go for dessert. Service was slower than I would like and when the staff was rearranging the tables beside us they knocked out stroller with a sleeping baby a couple times. It's a pain to go here so I try to avoid it. I do love the Yorkdale location, that is always a good time."}
{"text":"Just Not very good.....  The server didnt really seem interested or know how to give a recommendation.   I used to go to pickle barrel all the time years ago and I ordered the exact same Ap I always get, (Asian nachos) and its a far far cry from what it used to be. The food just isnt that good anymore. This place is pretty generic and I wouldnt come back."}
{"text":"The food is good, we never been disappointed, good variety of kids meals, tasty soups, tasty health menu, the sandwiches and the loaded burgers are recommended, the service mostly good, if anything is wrong they will replace or add, they have a big space so it safe to come to lunch or dinner even on weekends when many in many other good places you have to wait."}
{"text":"150 items to choose from is a bit daunting... Thank goodness, i like my breakfast...  Fast friendly service... Good price $6 for early bird breakfast special... Coffee was hot Server was attentive to our needs..  All went according to plan  Had to drop a star. Although everything was \"good\" at VM location, promenade 1 up'ed them in all departments"}
{"text":"Another family feed bag restaurant. This one has hot waitresses for the dad's to stare at while the women yell at the kids or complain about the quality of service.   Food was plentiful and tasted okay. A little higher on the price range but I guess that is what happens when you stick a restaurant like this in a mall like Vaughan Mills. Nothing really too special to write home about, or in this review. So I'll just stop writing now."}
{"text":"Oh Pickle Barrel, how do you continually disappoint in both food and service?  I was here a couple of weeks ago to see Star Wars on the first Sunday it had opened up and our organizer didn't reserve at the restaurant she wanted and they were filled to capacity as were choice 2 & 3.  So what were we to do but go to the Pickle Barrel.  We didn't have a choice and for most everyone we viewed the PB as a last resort type of place as this was the case.  Even though she made the reservation a couple of hours earlier when we arrived the hostess kept the entire group of fourteen waiting outside.  The official reason was that the table wasn't ready even though we could clearly see the table was in fact set.  When we finally got in the waitress confirmed that the table was ours and was set for at least 20 minutes!  After our food arrived, people were missing all sorts of things from mustard for smoked meat, toast to go with their all day breakfast,....etc.  It seemed like the restaurant got over run by movie goers and was severely understaffed.  The washrooms were also a mess and they'd run out of towels, and one of the soap dispensers was effectively non-functional.  That is a management problem...poor scheduling and poor check up on facilities.  I complained to the manager about the condition of the toilet and it was taken care of quite quickly though.  As for myself I ordered the matzo ball soup and smoked meat sandwich.   The matzo ball soup is underwhelming, kind of like weak chicken stock and matzo.  I've had much better at other restaurants.  The smoked meat was also very underwhelming, I would describe the flavour as bland.  This is why the PB will always be a last choice place to go."}
{"text":"Placed an order through Just Eat and the Pickle Barrel cancelled it 45 minutes after saying that they accepted and started preparing our meals. Just Eat tells us that they finally called them to say they couldn't accept online orders because they were too busy. The notice would've been appreciated a lot sooner. Food isn't the best quality (from past visits) but I definitely won't be giving them another shot after this. I'd love to see something else go into their space at Yonge & Dundas."}
{"text":"we were there once, on our way home from a very exhausting trip to toronto and we heard a radio suggestion for this place. the ambiance is nice, the place looks awesome for this type of venue, the menu is very diverse... but the food can be (and should be) a lot better. even the classics like ribs and wings leave a lot to be desired. as a last word of advice, don't try the paella, it's absolutely awful."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!!!!!  We have been sitting here for at least 45 minutes, no order taken other than an app. It's not even packed! So disappointed."}
{"text":"Actually alot larger than it looks from inside the mall, lots of comfortable seats & well spaced out too.  Service was great, our sever (Christin or Christine...sorry) was very attentive & the supporting staff were helpful as well. Corona came out nice and cold, my lime looked a little worse for wear but that's just being a bit picky. We had the Calamari to start and it was delicious. Both dipping sauces were great as well. In our group of three we had the PB Burger, mushroom Swiss burger and the Kung Pao bowl as our mains. All the dishes were fantastic & we'd recommend them all. We didn't have dessert but the surrounding tables did order some and they looked good too. We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, service was mediocre, overall dining experience was mediocre, luckily we were in good company so it wasn't an absolute disaster. However, I would never come back to this place as there are places MUCH better than this within walking distance.  We came as a party of 8 equipped with 5 \"Free Appetizer\" coupons. We were seated and the first thing we noticed was the GIGANTIC menu selection. There was a lot of things to choose from and a lot of us had to take some time to read all of it to decide what to eat. After a few minutes our server came without introducing himself, not even giving us a smile and asked if we wanted any drinks. We just said we wanted water for now and he simply left without responding. After a while he came back, again not smiling or even appearing to be happy, and we ordered 5 appetizers. 2 Nachos with meat sauce, 2 PEI Mussels and 1 Vegetable Quesadilla.   Nachos with Meat Sauce - These came in great portions smothered in cheese, jalepenos and meat sauce. They were gigantic and we could not finish them all even as a party of 8.  PEI Mussels (Spicy and Non Spicy) - These mussels must've been bought from Costco or something. They were bland, incredibly small in size, and totally not worth the asking price of $8.99 (luckily we got it free)  Vegetable Quesadilla - Alright but again, did not seem like it was made with much quality (seems like it was made from frozen)  It took a while for all our food to arrive after the appetizers came (alright I guess for a group of 8). I had the spanish paella, while my friends ordered maple salmon, pastrami, steak with goat cheese, and a few burgers. I had a taste of some of my friends food. My Spanish Paella was decent and tasty, however it felt like they used the same sauce for the mussells for my paella. My friend's steak with goat cheese was quite moist and tasty, while my other friend's pastrami sandwich was horribly dry and tasteless. We came to the conclusion that this place was hugely inconsistent with their food and it was most likely due to the huge menu.   Our overall experience was mediocre, luckily our free appetizers made it worthwhile to go. However, I would never recommend this place to anybody that is looking for a romantic or an excellent dining experience as this place is bland and boring (not incredibly cheap either)."}
{"text":"Doesn't look like much from the street,  but the escalator brings you to a very large subterranean resturaunt.  Immediate seating,  great server.  Great beer special of a 1 liter beer for $10.00.  I had the chicken fajitas,  my wife the kung pao chicken.  Both excellent!  We ordered a meal for our daughters,  and our waiter through in 2 Ceaser salads and extra side. I will probably return within the week. Oh,  forgot to mention the extensive menu!"}
{"text":"There are many good reasons why you should like this place:   1. It has a greasy burger if you don't care taking care of your heart 2. There's a pretentious healthy menu for those who ostentatiously watch their diet (and have cheesecake as dessert) 3. Free parking after 6pm  I am a sucker for free parking and this is a big plus. Food will be food for any franchise so I enjoy their different perks. There are cool booths where you can have decent conversation.   The last time I was in a small restaurant, I heard a story about bad cousin picking up another bad ass cousin. It was so bad that I dreamed about it for three nights.   The servers are adequately friendly and I had no complaint. It's not great. But then again, this is a franchise... this is NOT Cava.   I don't think you can get \"excellent\" service in any restaurant that offers $25 meals. I'm just saying."}
{"text":"If you want to hear some real Pittsburgh accents, this is ground zero. It's one of the most local joints I've been in, and I love it. The dogs are among the longest, but I might even prefer them plain to Pittsburgher with cheddar and olives on it. They use Smith hot dogs, which have some pork in there, the owner says it prevents them from shriveling up. I don't subscribe to kosher, so bring it maximum. Watch them grill it behind the counter and speak up to add on loaded fries - I wish I did.   Check out the other reviews: 5 stars, 5 stars, 4 stars, 2 stars and 1 star. That's some polarizing shit. And the 2 star is from a vegetarian, cat lady - Keep it! That's how I know Pickle Barrel is for me."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants but a friend and I were looking for a quiet place in the area to chat and catch up.  After seeing the loud and crazy atmosphere of the new Salad King, we decided on Pickel Barrel.  There was a lot of seating available, including many tables for two and cozy booths.  We settled in at a table and our waitress told us it was margarita night so we both ordered the lime flavor ($5.99).  The drinks arrived in massive glasses requiring both hands to hold.  For the meal, we order the talapia with Greek salad ($13.99) and the avacado sandwich with sweet potato fries ($11.99).  The sandwich was probably better than the fish which was just a slab of salty, slightly burned talapia on a bed of salad consisting of mostly onions and green peppers.  Service was friendly, quick and they left us alone long enough for a good ol' gossip and catching up session."}
{"text":"FOOD:  PRO: One of their desserts called Chocolate Molten Lava Cake blew me away. It is the bomb! Will go back to this place just for this dessert, not the main dishes. CON: Main dishes tastes just okay.  AMBIANCE:   PRO: Ambiance is amazing. It's a sports bar with huge space with huge couches, nice tables, two floors and a nice, big washroom separate for men and women.  PRICE:   PRO: The price is justified when it comes to the Chocolate Molten Lava Cake dessert. You get the value of what you paid for here. CON: I think it's a bit pricey for the main dishes, food was just okay."}
{"text":"I went on good Friday so it was a little slower in service but not the worst. Staff was friendly .  I ordered the chicken parmesan and penne but the sauce tasted bland. Almost like they opened a can of sauce and just threw it on. Not impressed with that .  Would not recommend this place for pasta but for sandwiches and burgers etc would be good."}
{"text":"From it's humble beginnings as a suburban deli and rib joint, the Pickle Barrel has grown to become Toronto's version of the Cheesecake Factory (at least until the actual Cheesecake Factory arrives).    The chain's own slogan now promises 'something for everyone', a claim backed up by a phonebook-sized menu (complete with advertisements). Time was, if you stuck to the old-school deli, the all-day breakfasts and the Passover menu (for the doubly-unkosher cihcken fingers and greek salad) you could still put together an enjoyable greasy-spoon experience.   Then, they hired Rose Reisman as a consultant, and all Hell broke loose.   Today's Pickle Barrel largely eschews the food and portion sizes of yore. There are wraps. There are panini. There is nutty couscous. I want to know what nutty couscous decided these options were necessary.   Deli staple lox and cream cheese is no longer available on a proper bagel; only thin slices of stale black bread (did I mention that dinner used to come with a massive, fresh pumpernickel loaf? Just sayin').    Bran muffins that tasted as good as they tenderized your innards are nowhere to be found. Proper greasebomb latkes have only recently returned, a quarter of their former size, while the illustriously deep-fried french toast seems to be gone for good (NOTE TO FOODIES: THEY SELL IT AT THE NEW YORKER DELI ON BAY STREET).   Ribs are still fine, but smothered in iteratively sweeter sauce for higher prices. Liver with onions and a bonus grilled hot dog is but a memory.   I pause to note that I am reviewing a restaurant that no longer exists.   I wonder if this is how the Cheesecake factory got it's start."}
{"text":"Thursday night around 7pm, 2 guests (including myself).  Service - we were on street level when we entered but there was noone there to greet us (seems to be a problem with this chain), so we proceeded down the escalator and went to the front of the subway entrance. We were seated promptly and our server came. Very nice man, very attentive and did not rush us at all. Bad timing with food, the table is already so small, at least time the food to come out when we're done eating the previous course!  Food - Hummus dip - shared that with Friend, SO GOOD. French Onion Soup - skip this, seriously. It's bad for you and isn't worth it. Way too salty, soggy croutons and WAY WAY WAY too much cheese. It was at best a melted cheese soup.  Friend had Grilled Vegetable & Goat Cheese Omelette, it was too much for her (good thing) but she was excited about the couscous and it was cold, that disappointed her. Also it doesn't say on the menu there are raisins in the couscous...  Florentine Benedict - Soggy bread with TOUGH crust, couldn't easily cut into it. Good eggs. Bad hollandaise sauce, was severely watered down and didn't taste like much. And I'm pretty sure they put lox instead of just smoked salmon. If not, I don't want to know how SALTY their lox is...  Margaritas are yummy and HUGE and were the special. Of course we didn't expect it to be too alcoholy, they underpour at chains, I'm pretty sure.  We didn't eat dessert this time around, way too full even for those mini ones."}
{"text":"This place has a huge menu several pages long with almost anything you could want, including all-day breakfast! I got the 3 egg breakfast with sausage. Food was great except for the pork sausages. They were 90% fat. I'm all for flavour but they were just mush, there was barely any meat. Pretty gross. My friend got one of their impressive sundae desserts, I forget which one. It's pretty hard to mess up sugar based goods, although I give credit for the presentation. Service was friendly. Overall not a bad place for a meal!"}
{"text":"Day bartender was great; very engaging. Made me a nice margarita. Night bartender began shift by eating behind the bar, which I wouldn't recommend. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This Pickle Barrel is the go-to location for a lot of night-outs with friends. I've been there over a dozen times in the past couple years and I must be lucky considering the amount of lacklustre reviews from other Yelpers.  The food is alright, considering the long list of dishes on their menu. I've had my share of food I would never order again and ones that I'll keep coming back for.  I love their P.B. House Burger. Pretty common toppings, but they work and I don't see why it needs to be changed. The portion size is good, enough for me to be comfortably full.  Chicken Fingers.... thumbs up.  The P.B. Original Jumbo Club House is something to consider as well. No complaints. Ingredients are nice together.  I suggest passing on the Fried Chicken and Waffles though... I find the taste very monotonous... the Jalapeno Corn waffles just taste like regular waffles... I don't get how those two ingredients enhance the waffle itself. The chicken was fried well, but I found that it was lacking enough seasoning.  Apart from the food, I've found the staff to be quite welcoming - friendly for the most part. That may be just the group I usually go with (We book using the name 'Batman'), but no one's been a downer. Heck, I even got my dinner for free once (after waiting an hour and a half for my food). The waitress was really considerate then, and I haven't forgotten about it since.  Respect and understand your server and you may just get great service too :)."}
{"text":"My friend and I randomly decided to check out this place one evening after work. She got a noodle salad and a beer and I got a lychee lemonade and fried pickles. You can't mess up deep fried pickles, but I didn't love the breadcrumb/panko coating. It was too hard to bite into - it scraped the roof of my mouth every bite. I'm not a huge fan of sweet drinks so I asked the waitress for the least sweet cocktail they had, she suggested the lychee lemonade. The lemonade was still too sweet on it's own so I mixed it with club soda - it was much better after that. Service wasnt great. Our waitress wasnt friendly and she was inattentive. It took 25min to order when there was barely anybody in the restaurant. And our bill took just as long to grab from her, after asking for it. I wont go back, but I heard they have happy hour specials and I may go if I had no other choice."}
{"text":"Came here to have a nice dinner after a day at a spa. Place didn't look busy and lots of tables are available. The lady at the reception said to her walkie-talkie something that sounded like 911. And I was offered a seat in far corner by the kitchen. The place stinks like high heavens. Feels like I am some sort of servant disgraced by my master. Mushrooms is the only nicely tasting food on my plate. Steak tastes like it is made out of rubber. Potatoes taste like carton. Cannot believe this crap costs $23! Shame on you for serving this garbage. My dog wouldn't eat it. Leaving hungry! Such a contrast to Pickle Barrel at Yonge & Eglinton.  Strongly recommend to avoid this place!  Leaving now, will have my dinner elsewhere. PS the charged me for beer only."}
{"text":"Five of us came here for dinner, and had absolutely horrible service.  We were seated by a polite host, but that is the extent of what I can say in defence of this restaurant.  Once seated, the waiter told us about their drink specials and left for about 10 minutes.  We then ordered drinks & meals, and once the drinks arrived the waiter did absolutely nothing to check in on us.  Unfortunately, one of the sodas we ordered were nothing but club soda.  When we informed the waiter that the syrup was not working correctly, he said \"oh\" and asked what other soft drink we wanted instead.  The food arrived a short while later, and the waiter set the food down and didn't ask if we needed anything else, he just walked away.  As he walked away we had to stop him to ask for a refill on the soft drink (which he forgot).  Three out of the five meals were awful, overly greasy and the turkey burger was dry and flavourless.  We had to flag the waiter again to get a single soft drink refill, and at no point did the waiter ever ask how the food was.  Worst. Service. Ever."}
{"text":"Went out to grab some dinner and drinks for the night. The place was nice, not too busy and our table was big for just the 3 of us. Service was great, quick to take our order/ serve and was very polite.   I ordered the pesto chicken fettuccine, and both my friends ordered the chicken Parmesan. I enjoyed my dish, however the chicken Parmesan wasn't a hit with my friends. They said the chicken felt rubbery, and the spaghetti was ok. I offered some of my dish to my friends and said that they liked the pesto better."}
{"text":"I've eaten here three times so far, and I believe that I have tried their entire menu, most of it at least...and I can comfortably say that I can't pick one good item To brag about! I tend to go back though due to the limited options of actual dine-in restaurants at Vaughan Mills. There is a big food court, sure...but aside from that, Pickle Barrel is the only one still hanging after Johnny rockets, Eggspectation and the bowling lounge all shut down! There is gotta be a reason behind all these places closing down.  This place is huge, with so many booths and larger areas for big groups, service is not bad at all too, but the food! It's strange how a place like that can't come-up with a better chef to revamp their whole menu! Poor portions and missing any flavours, gotta step up your game pickle barrel, asap, otherwise, you'll follow the rest!"}
{"text":"My experience at Pickle Barrel located inside Vaughan Mills exceeded my expectation. As I don't really have much expectations at all.  Patio area is spacious and well laid out with a mix of sunny and shaded area.   Surprisingly it was empty on a Saturday evening.   Service was attentive and we were being checked on numerous time!  Daily drink special with at least a beer and cocktail for $5. If not there is also Beau's in bottle format for around $10.  A great place to chill out after some shopping at Vaughan Mills!"}
{"text":"I guess if you like bland, uninteresting food that comes out of a freezer, the Pickle Barrel could be your kind of place.  I always wondered why the place had the Bible for a menu (literally 30 pages long), and then it was finally explained to me by my boyfriend -- \"The only way they can keep that many food choices on hand everyday is by keeping them all frozen.\" Ahhhhh. It all makes sense now. I can choose between a million different items that will all be prepared in the same amount of time because they just have to be defrosted!  GROSS. They're a huge chain restaurant with a huge following of people who are more comfortable eating somewhere familiar than trying something new that will likely use fresh food and taste substantially better.  To be honest, when I go out, I expect that my food will taste better than the Michelina's I eat on a really lazy day. At Pickle Barrel, it won't. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This was a very nice place, servers are friendly and food is amazing. I had the mushroom burger and it was fantastic! Appetizers like the squid rings was amazing. Would not recommend the small appetizer that had chicken in it."}
{"text":"I was visiting with my family and in-laws the overall experience was awesome despite Saturday night rush hour the management and server Steven pull the best service with food and experience. We all had good time including kids....... Nachos was the best choice to order as a appetizer and for the main dish we had Steak, Seafood linguine, Chicken Pesto pasta, Classic burger, PB Sandwich and some extra appetizer everything turns out delicious.   Thanks to the management on Saturday night December 9/2017 we will visit soon and recommend to family and fiends"}
{"text":"I tried the short rib appy, a Canada 150 special.  Not good, not much flavour.  And for $15,overpriced.  Had the Thai cauliflower and avocado spring rolls instead, they were great.  Rueben for main, always good."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday to try the $4.99 Bloody Caesar special. It looked great but tasted like it was really watered down. We ordered the Santa Fe salad. The portion was okay but overall, not worth $16. Don't think we will be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I got the Fried chicken and waffles and it is good...if you have one of them. It comes in 3 mini portions and honestly, the taste does get boring after. And mouth starts to feel weird because of the syrup and texture of the waffles. Would only get again ifnibwas sharing. But service was good. Can't complain."}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling good but still came out tonight to eat. My mom chose pickle barrel cause they have wicked matzo ball soup which she hoped would make me feel better.  We sat in the bar area because in the dinning room there was TONES of screaming kids. Our server was VERY friendly and VERY patient with us. We all ordered the matzo ball soup and it was delicious! At the end of our meal our server with out asking brought out a cute dessert stand with mini martini glasses filled with different cakes!  SOO CUTE! We each HAD to have one.. Soo delicious too!!  We are deffinitly coming back to this location!  If you do choose to come here tho and are not with children, ASK TO SIT IN THE BAR! Otherwise you will feel like you are in a McDonalds playplace! :) Goodluck."}
{"text":"Food was good . Service could have been better . We visited in afternoon we expected quicker service , however service was very slow . Food was good as always the quantity and quality of food is good . The Center point mall location is far better than Vaughan mills location."}
{"text":"It's not my first choice but they do have an extensive selection in their menu. Food is okay nothing too great and they validate parking after 6pm which is great considering it's downtown."}
{"text":"For being a chain restaurant I expected better! I was attending a show at the near by theater on a Saturday Night and decided to head down early to grab a bite to eat. I did my research a head of time to look for the place that had something healthy to order. I really like the fact that they had their nutritional information on their website. I planned out my entire meal a head of time so I wouldn't be tempted when I arrived.   I decided on the 8oz TOP SIRLOIN with a DOUBLE order of vegetables. It originally came with vegetables and a potato side option. I didn't want the potato so though double vegetables sounded about right. Boy.. with the little amount of vegetables I got, I would hardly call that one side! I asked for me steak to be cooked medium well. When it arrived it looked to be a decent piece of meat.. well until I took my first bite. It had NO SEASONING at ALL!! I also found it to be a little more on the medium (rare) side then well done.  I was shocked at our waitress as well, her lack of service was shocking since this seems to be a hot spot not only for the theater but also for the Eaton center. While we were waiting for our meals I stood up to take a few photos (yes selfies) by the table only to see the cleaning boy starting to clean our table. He had his hands all over the rim of our glasses and then when we returned he put them down. The waitress didn't offer a new glass until we had to say something.   All in all very disappointed with the service at this chain restaurant location!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Texas style steak sandwich and it was delicious!!!!  Steak lovers, this is a good choice. Good service."}
{"text":"We had just an hour break between films at the Toronto Film Festival, and this place was just across the street from the theater, so we decided to run in for a quick sandwich.  The place is HUGE and the menu is even bigger.  Luckily it was a beautiful Toronto afternoon and we were able to grab a table outside.  The tables outside are SO popular that the outdoor dining area has been extended from immediately near the restaurant to right out in the street.  Interesting!  I ordered a cheeseburger with Canadian Cheddar Cheese.  It came with French fries that were a bit soggy and DELICIOUS cole slaw.  I love that kind of vinegary (rather than mayo-y) slaw.  So fresh and crunchy!  The burger was pretty good.  It was big enough and the toppings were fresh enough, but somehow it lacked a certain depth of flavor.  Maybe the cheddar should have been sharper.  I just can't put my finger on it.  Not a bad burger..... not a great burger.... just kind of middle of the road."}
{"text":"This was the worst! The food was 'meh'. But what made the entire experience just plain awful was the service. Our waitress was beyond terrible. We asked if she could ask the barman to recommend a semi-sweet white wine- and she very confidently replied that she works at the bar often, so we could just ask her. So we said, 'Okaay- what do you recommend?' She then had to look at our drink menu (which had a total of 5 white wines), and surprise, surprise, picks out the most expensive one. Then, we ask if we could try it first. So she brings out a carafe with literally a milliliter of wine, with no glass, and says, 'Oh you can just drink from there!' Umm no. We will not drink from the carafe! [Have you ever heard of such a thing?!] We would like a glass please. So she then brings out a tall water glass. Hmm, interesting. Ok. It's dry- not at all sweet. Could we please try the Pinot? To which she says, 'No. Management only lets our patrons try ONE wine.' Seriously?!  Gosh I can't get over how bad she was. She didn't fill up our waters even once, even after asking her to! And she said they were out of things they weren't really out of- we knew because we could see them being brought to nearby tables.  People have bad days. I get it. But judging from the rest of the reviews of this place, maybe it's time to think of new management and new staff."}
{"text":"It's been over two years since our last lunch here and the decor still looks inviting. Friendly staff and quick service. We ordered our usual favourite deli platter (smoked Montreal meat, corned beef and pastrami) where you make your own sandwiches. Comes with coleslaw, pickle and $1.00 more for a matzo ball soup. Their menu seems interesting with quick order list for $1.99 you get sweet potato chips but disappointed as they came a little soggy. Well the main thing, we still enjoy their deli platter. Will recommend this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my last visit to Pickle Barrel ended in a bit of a \"Pickle Surprise\". And not the good kind that shows up randomly on YouTube and features the on-screen debut of RuPaul, ya dig?  So let's see...about once a month I head to Pickle Barrel, eat a meal, and then buy a jar of their sandwich pickles at the takeout counter to enjoy at home. I've done this about a dozen times and most of the time it's a hassle-free mission. One time I had to explain where to get the pickles, but otherwise it's never a problem.  This time around, the takeout girl had no idea what I was talking about and even went so far as to accuse me of lying and \"not knowing what I was talking about\" because she had been an employee since day one and had never HEARD of anyone buying pickles to go. From PICKLE Barrel.  Sheesh. She told me she could get me some pickles but only if she charged me $1.50 per pickle, because she had no idea how else to ring it in. I told her fine, I'd take $10 worth (7-8 pickles according to her price point). She charged me $14 and then walked away from the counter.  And didn't come back.  10-15 minutes elapsed and I was standing there with my receipt, wondering where she had gone (every other time I've bought pickles the person took them from the display case) and when (if?) she was going to come back.  After another 5 minutes I got frustrated and called on one of the hostesses to refund my money because I was tired of waiting and unimpressed that the takeout person had just left me standing there with no explanation of where she was going or when she'd be back. The hostess wasn't very helpful and told me she couldn't refund my money, but someone else could. As I was being tersely refunded by another random person, the takeout girl came back with a plastic bag of pickles and plopped them down on the counter to give to me.   I explained to her that a) I was unimpressed that she had taken so long and had gotten a refund and b) that pickles normally came in a jar. In brine. Not randomly in sealed plastic bag the way they arrive from the distributor. She scoffed and I walked out.  I like everything else about my monthly Pickle Barrel experience but this takeout nightmare that I endured left such a \"sour\" taste in my mouth that I'm in a bit of a \"pickle\" as to whether or not I should bother giving them my business again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Worst ever. They took forever to give us a table, half of the tables in the restaurants were empty but they wouldn't use them I don't know why. There was a family with a little girl outside sitting on the floor, I mean, there is a waiting area but nobody told us about it. Even people who had reservation were waiting for a long time.Then they took forever (more than half an hour) to serve our food and when it finally came it was dry and cold and it wasn't even what we ordered. One of the forks was disgustingly dirty. They don't have enough staff."}
{"text":"A three star \"A-OK\" is pretty appropriate for my experience here. Service was friendly, and the food was decent. My team of four came here for a quick end-of-year lunch last month, and the place was completely full that Friday afternoon. We called to make a reservation just an hour before, so we didn't have to wait for a table. I don't remember our server's name, but he was friendly and efficient, even though he was a little held up by all the other patrons he had to wait on.   We wanted to get the tempura green beans to share, but they were out of that so we got the deep fried dills instead. Not something I would ever order because I don't really like pickles that much (don't ask why I was at a restaurant with pickle in its name), but I was pleasantly surprised by these! They were fried well, and tasted tangy yet cool and refreshing with the garlic ranch dipping sauce. My fressor sandwich (marble rye, corned beef, pastrami, swiss cheese, coleslaw, russian dressing) was quite decent. The meat definitely isn't the best I've had, but I still enjoyed it! The bread was a little dry, and the overall portion was huge. But I liked it and would've finished it all if I wasn't so full already.  All in all, not bad but not amazing. I probably won't be back because I rarely choose to dine at chain restaurants when there are so many options in the area."}
{"text":"The Pickle Barrel is a great place to eat in the Eaton Center. Their menu is seriously about 20 pages long. It is almost overwhelming. They make almost every type of dish: Appetizers, breakfast all day, steaks, burgers, stir fries, pasta, sandwiches and salads.   My favorite dishes to order: -Thai Lettuce wraps -Asian wonton nachos -Arancini -Fajitas -BBQ ribs  -Belgian waffles with strawberry ice cream  I would definitely recommend that you save room for dessert, however, that's very difficult because the portions are huge. If you don't have room for a full dessert, they offer mini dessert cups in several different flavors. My favorite is the mini tiramisu.   The cocktails are also delicious. The frozen peach Bellini is massive, but very tasty!  It's certainly not five-star quality food, but it's always delicious and the servers are always nice."}
{"text":"Food was average and took a long time to come, service was friendly but there's nothing really special to come back for. The paella was full of seafood and flavorful but the burger just decent, seemed like something that could be found anywhere.  Overall, probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I'd have to say the Pickle Barrel is probably one of the worst food experiences I have every experienced.  It had been a few years since I had eaten at PB, and with a new menu and a new look, my expectations were set a little about mediocre. Unfortunately, they could not even live up to my already low standards. The food looked like it had sat under the heat lamps for 20 mins., and just as it looked, it tasted pretty terrible.  The Pickle Barrel is a sorry excuse for a restaurant!"}
{"text":"minus 5 stars  crap menu  even worse service  went with a group of 12 people...which their policy meant that 10% was added to all of our bills as a gratuity charge once we all had our food, we didn't see the waitress for an hour and ten minutes  and all of us hit the bottom of our drinks.  and it's not like she didn't walk by us...cause she did.  the only redeming factor of this place was the good selection of dessert menu i'll NEVER go back"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Sherway for Valentines dinner the server was super nice and mentioned all the promos, dinner was lovely but when I ordered dessert there was a hair in it. We love going there but think they should be more careful on handling the food (maybe use hairnets) and check the food before presentation."}
{"text":"I like this pickle barrel. I find restaurants in malls van be hit or miss and this one is for sure a hit. It's a comfortable oasis in the middle of what is sometimes a chaotic mall experience.  Location It's located in Vaughan Mills.  Parking: Suburb mall so tonnes of space but can be incredibly stressful. There's a few buses that come here, take those and save yourself some blood pressure points :)  Decor:  I the nice weather seasons they have a patio that you can sit out on. As with most PB patios it's pretty great.  This trip I was with an octogenarian who preferred to sit inside. The inside is pretty great too.  Comfortable seats, lots of really great looking lighting. Music playing at a nice volume, loud enough that you can hear it but quiet enough that you can talk. No assault on the ears.  Menu:  This place has the typical PB menu, something for everyone.  Food:  I've noticed food quality can vary from PB to PB. This one has always been pretty good. Maybe I have been very lucky but I've never had anything terrible.  I got the Thai inspired beef salad. Which I thought was great as usual. My dining companion got the toasted chicken and avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries. She loved the sandwich. It was a monster in size. I had some of the fries. They were cooked well.   Overall:  It's a great place to duck into when the hunger strike and you are bargain hunting at Vaughan mills! You can rest your weary feet and grab so.erhung good to eat."}
{"text":"Great food and large portions. Kids menu offers more than the usual chicken, Mac and cheese or pizza."}
{"text":"Took the kids here for dinner one night after hockey..we were all starving and I was too tired to cook- ordered the steak and if I didn't know better, I'd swear it was the leather off someone's shoe ( I think shoe leather might be even more tender)..not even the starving kids would eat it.we left and I ended making dinner at home anyway..when youre used to home cooked food you become the harshest kind of food critic. We won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Went there the first time last night with family. The sever seated us on the last possible table in he restaurant in a corner, I guess coz we had kids with us. Upon being seated, we had to wave the staff requesting someone to attend to us. It was taking so long that I just got myself up and grabbed a drink from the bar.  The menu selections seemed very good and appetizing.  We were 5 adults at the table and when the food came out, Everyone said one thing: \"the food is bland. It lacks flavor\" All 5 different entrees were lacking something. Wasn't a good experience at all with regards to food or service. My suggestion: there are many places there. Go somewhere else"}
