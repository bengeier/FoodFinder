{"text":"The food here is very good and so is the service. We ate lunch AND dinner here December 27th, because it was so good. The turnip and anise soup was to die for. What a neat combination! French bistro and some of the best sushi I've ever had. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to bring a date or have a casual meal!
The restaurant is composed of two kitchens. One is for French cooked meals and the other for sushi. My girlfriend and I had the sushi and it was delicious (10/10). 
The staff is really nice and the quality of service was excellent. The restaurant itself is new (only 1 and a half years old) with very comfortable seating. 
I strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Everything here is done with love and attention to every detail. We tried the wasabi cocktail, onion cream soup, miso soup, and lunch maki rolls. All perfect, creative, great flavors. Salmon with spicy Rice Krispies roll was the best part. Decor and service were outstanding. A gem!"}
{"text":"What a unique and amazing restaurant - half French and half sushi!! The presentation of the food is absolutely beautiful, and the taste is even better. The prices are tremendously affordable as well, especially when compared to other sushi restaurants in town like Kyo. Highly, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Je suis allé hier le 6 décembre pour mon anniversaire en compagnie de 12 autres personnes.
Nous avons consommé 8 bonne bouteilles de vins et très bien mangé. 
Le service et la nourriture délicieuse. 
Le 2 étoiles est pour l'attitude du chef car nous avons demandé si il voulait nous offrir des shooters et au lieu de nous les offrir nous les à chargé pour 56$. Je me fiche qu'il nous les ai chargés mais avec une table qui te rammène 2000$ t'es pas pas trop service client. Je peux vous dire que ce resto ne resteras pas ouvert longtemps avec l,attitude due chef!! ! PFFF Il à oser nous dire : \"C,est quoi vous comprennez pas vous autres les QC . Vous voulez que je vous enlève 5.00$ ?!! C'est quoi cette attitude de merde??!!
Si vous chercher un bon resto pour fêter votre fête allez à l'Ouzeri sur St-Denis - Isabelle Carrier gérante.. Elle elle sait comment fidéliser sa clientèle et elle n'a non plus n'a pas été trop impressionné."}
{"text":"I have never had sushi this fresh in Montreal. The sushi chef is from Japan and it really shows. 
It was excellent quality and I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a gem! We stumbled upon this place while looking for a sushi restaurant - we got so much more! I've never in my life heard of a restaurant equally serving both French and Japanese (and equally as well, with two distinct and amazing chefs). There was nobody in the restaurant when we went which was off putting, but the decor was modern, chic and the waitress was kind and knowledgeable. It was a perfect date spot.

We got le Table d'Hote with a choice of either cuisine for three courses. The miso soup was excellent if not just standard miso soup. We had French salmon tartare and the seared scallops. The scallops were incredibly tender and the sauce (vanilla grapefruit) was a perfect complement. The salmon was amazing and citrusy and fresh. The appetizers were truly great. 

The two of us had the two different sushi main courses, and WOW. What a great spread. Eel, trout, tuna, salmon, crab, shrimp. Beautiful and fresh maki, and the nigiri and sashimi were tender and delicious. We tried whelks for the first time - not something to be scared of - they were tender and well marinated. We shared both mains and shared both appetizers and it was the most wonderful date spot.

All in all, this restaurant was excellent. A massive and diverse 3 course meal for $38 was worth every penny! We loved the idea and creativity of this place - TRY IT!"}
{"text":"Ce restaurant a la particularité de proposer des plats typiquement français et typiquement asiatique. C'est à dire que l'on peut par exemple manger en entrée un soupe miso et en plat un boeuf bourguignon. C'est un parti pris qui pour ma part me plait et certains menus permettent de combiner justement les cultures.

Je retiendrais surtout le plateau de sushi d'une très bonne qualité avec un poisson frais et avec du goût. Ma femme avait choisi un confit de canard au porto qui était aussi très bien assaisonné et pour finir nos dessert était parfaits : une tarte au pomme exquise et une crème brûlée au thé de compétition nous ont permis de finir sur une très bonne note sucrée ce restaurant.

De plus si vous êtes au bar vous pourrez voir le chef préparer les sushis :)

Je vous le recommande fortement !"}
{"text":"Love the place, love the service and the food is perfection.
I highly recommend Sa Fran !"}
{"text":"Interesting idea combining Japanese and French. I walked past this place by chance and decided to give it a try. The miso soup was on par and the sushi average. But the waiter was very nice. It also helped that I was one of the only two customers at 3 pm on a weekday. In short - good enough, and a quiet place to relax."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife on a Thursday evening. The French dishes we had were delicious (soup of the day and the sea bass). The sushi was excellent, extremely fresh and beautifully presented. This is one of the handful of restaurants in Montreal where the sushi is actually made by a Japanese chef, who is very friendly.

The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant! Service agréable et attentionné... Les plats sont bons, des saveurs au rendez-vous. Un petit bémol sur le dessert."}
{"text":"This little gem on St. Denis is a serious winner for brunch.
I was looking for a new Sunday brunch place, as one of my favorite places unfortunately closed down, so I decided to give Sa-Fran a try. The atmosphere is great, interior décor is very cool, service is excellent and so is food.
My review is 5 stars."}
{"text":"Two stars includes the very nice waiter's service. Other then that, it would of been a star, star and half top!

We came on a Sunday evening, we're on vacation. I made sure by calling them to ask if the fish is fresh of the day or not. The reason why is that they were going to be closed for the next two days and that i wanted to be sure they weren't going to be serving us leftover seafood. The person on the phone assured me that it's always fresh from the day and that they are \"used\" to being opened on Sundays. \"Do not worry 'mam. You will not get food poisoning!\" Ok 

There was total six guests including my husband and I. Slow night?! Plus, we had to wait about 30-40 minutes in between services. I also saw the sushi Chef running around like a headless chicken at one point. Was he the only kitchen staff? Anyways let's just get to business. 

We got:

Signature house cocktail. Very good and original. But small drink and expensive! 

Miso soup
Vichyssoise soup
Tuna tartar \"cappuccino\" entrée
A sake bomb entrée
The maki plate assortment
The \"chef d'oeuvre\" plate assortment
Molten chocolate cake
Crème brûlée duo. 

The soups were ok. My main concern was my entrée the tuna tartar with it's viscous, slimy weird tasting foam. The tuna was FAR from fresh. I had a hard time swallowing it. At one point i just wanted to run to the bathroom or just spit it out! It was THAT bad! Felix hard ordered the beef tataki but they didn't have it so they offered him the sake bomb. A fried rice ball with salmon. It was ok. Sushis now. We got a total of 30 pieces and ended up eating about 8-9 pieces total! Those pieces didn't have raw fish in them. The ones with the raw seafood were \"weirdly different\" then what we are used to. The freshness wasn't there! The only success from the evening was the desserts. They were surprisingly delicious! Thankfully the waiter was very nice and attentive! But was it because we were only six??? 

I would NEVER recommend anyone to go there for sushi. Perhaps the french bistro side is better. I will never know because i will NOT be coming back. The concept is original but i don't think that French cuisine and Japanese cuisine mesh well together.

We both got upset stomachs..."}
