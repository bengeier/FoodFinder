{"text":"Where do I start - I've been visiting Tita for the past 18 months, and I'm sure I've been there about 20 times.  Firstly, the place \"feels\" authentic, like a pupuseria that you'd find in Salvador/Central America, somewhat small - about 8 tables, but very cozy with Latin soap operas or music videos playing in the background.  Secondly, Tita is such a friendly and joyous person - always in a good mood and shows it.  I'm always happy just to open the door and say hello to her if I'm walking by the area, and not even eating.  Lastly - what this site is for: the food.  Let's put it this way - my wife is a Latina, and the ONLY food she doesn't \"have to have\" when she goes home is Pupusas because she gets her fill at Tita's.  9 times outta 10 we'll feast on her amazing Pupusa's that are dirt cheap.  I'm a big guy - and 3 will fill me - 4 will almost be overkill.  Other food we've had are the tacos, flautas, and mixed-meat plate - all are very good - but there is a reason why it's called a \"pupuseria\"... the pupusas!  If you don't know what they are - I suggest you head on over to check it out - not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Amazing everytime! Their beef burrito can change lives. Love the ladies that work there too!"}
{"text":"Poor service and average food don't mix!. I am Salvadorean and been to plenty hole in the wall Salvadorean restaurants and this is the first time I take \"the time\" to write a review with so \"few stars\". The young lady was the waitress and cook. The pupusas were hard as a rock and chicharrones greasy!. If it wasn't for the fresh veggies, I would of given no stars (if that is possible!). So, next month that I am in Toronto again, I will visit other Salvadorean restaurants and other Latin American cuisine. On the plus side, the fresh veggies is nice; but, please, where was the cook?"}
{"text":"The food is good,  very authentic homemade style Latin American food."}
{"text":"We came here late at night looking for some delicious treats after the bar. There were only a couple of tables waiting in the homey and kitschy decorated space. So I thought \"Great, we'll be in and out in maybe 15 minutes. Just enough time to enjoy the food and rest our tired heads.\" Boy, was I wrong. Service was extremely, extremely slow. We ordered just two pupusa (this being a pupusaria and all) and it took 45 minutes! It seemed like the cooks (you could see right into the kitchens) didn't know how to time or dovetail any tasks. They cooked each order one at a time; talking to each other while waiting for the food to cook. Put the pupusas on in the meantime!   I did enjoy the pupusas in the end, some of the best I've had. The salsa and cabbage salad that came with each were wonderful and fresh. I would come back and try the food again, but please don't make me wait 45 minutes for food ever again."}
{"text":"This is our local go-to for Salvadorian pupusas and tamales. Walking in feels like visiting someone's kitchen for dinner. You can even see them working in the back! It's homey and small with no pretense  (or table cloths!) and the food takes a while but it's well worth the wait. I recommend getting a starter to share or ordering the same dishes if you want to eat at the same time. The staff is very sweet and welcoming.   Better prices, portion sizes and quality than any of the places I've tried south of St. Clair."}
