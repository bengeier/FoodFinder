{"text":"It's great that Thai House is so close to my house because I have some major Thai cravings.  That being said, I've found this place very hit or miss.

Hits: fresh veggie springrolls, red curry, pad thai, chicken wings.

Misses: the soups (I've tried at least 5, and to me they all lack flavor), fried rice, roasted duck.

Also, the staff isn't the friendliest.  Even when there aren't many people in the restaurant.  Not rude, per se, just not very welcoming.  And if you come during dinner, expect a considerable wait until you get your food."}
{"text":"Staff is extremely rude when you call for take out orders. Beware of disrespectful service."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Thai House. The portions are more than generous and the prices, especially for lunch, are fantastic. I really can't say there's anything here I have ordered and not enjoyed. The rice is delicious, so is the soup. The thai isn't the greatest in the world but for the price it's a quick lunch that can't be beat. The service isn't pushy, but sometimes you do need to really flag down the server. Overall a place I really enjoy. Recommended!"}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Thai Restaurant since moving to Las Vegas by far.  It's incomparable to other Thai places out there that my family and I have been to.  I find their food very tasty.  Yes, sometimes service can be slow but it's usually because they are short staffed so that's forgivable. We have complained about a loud waitress who was just starting back then but she seemed to have toned down so that was nice.  What matters is that we love the place, managers, friendly staff, and of course the food.  I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"We get the pad Thai chicken & Thai fried rice, both good dishes but especially like the rice. Have tried the satay & spring rolls for appetizers they are good as well. Service is decent & food comes out fast. Nice & clean place. If we are hungry for thai food this is our spot."}
{"text":"Thai house is great! My husband and I order from here regularly and the food is always delicious. Delivery times are pretty quick, it's always still hot upon arrival and the delivery people are very friendly which is nice. I personally love the duck fried rice."}
{"text":"Kalila and I went in for a quick dinner and we ordered beef Pad See Ew and Lemon chicken. Both were delicious!

The Pad See Ew's beef was a little too tough. There weren't enough noodles either. Maybe because Kalila sucked them down like a vacuum cleaner, but we still could've used more.

The lemon chicken is really a tempura fried chicken strip w/ their special lemon sauce. Eat it with rice & it's a great meal!

The service was pretty good. We got a good amount of water refills and a rice refill.

The venue is clean. It has a dance floor/stage for karaoke. There was a TV where I was very happy to watch football while waiting for our food.

This is a great place to order a lot of dishes and share them all, family style."}
{"text":"I called in a lunch order and they messed it up. The panang is really good but I've definitely had better pad thai and some other curry dishes. Still, it is reasonably priced. Customer service is lacking."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from Thai House for years!!! On some occasions we choose to dine in the restaurant...when you have a little extra time to spare its nice to sit in their dining room. The waitresses all wear traditional costume which accentuates your Thai dining experience. The waitstaff are all very personable too.
We have had the pleasure of traveling to Thailand...and the food that we eat at Thai House is very authentic...and transports your taste buds back to those days of dining on the beaches of Phuket. 
Some of our favorites are Tom Kha,Tom Yum, Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Sweet Chili Chicken, Red Chicken Curry, Basil Fried Rice, Chicken Chili Mint, Ginger Chicken, Cashew Chicken,Thai tea, and the list goes on...
I've ordered online and over the phone. I've never had a challenge with my order being incorrect...sometimes a few minutes late...but so very worth it!!! We've ordered from Thai House so much that its a warm welcome to see their delivery driver at our door!!! They do their scale from 1-10...we usually do between 5-7...it's the perfect spice level that the dishes aren't so hot that you can't appreciate the flavor of the dish that you're about to enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food, in a clean friendly atmosphere. Staff is attentive, although it can get very busy around noon on weekdays. This is one of my favorite places for a quick inexpensive lunch. Highly recommended. Dinner portions are quite large so expect to take home a doggie bag."}
{"text":"I have been to this place for 3 times now... Their service sucks... Quality of food is worst... I had papaya salad and chicken fried rice last time and I had food poisoning and I threw up on my way back to work.... I am not going back again"}
{"text":"First time at Thai House today.  4 words .. Thai for the American.  Tom Kha was par.  Pad Se Ew was C- and beef steak wouldn't have again.  Equates to Panda Express for Chinese food.  Try Seeda NYC 50th and 8th; much closer to the motherland.  //dc"}
{"text":"the 1-star rating is based on my one and only visit, so take it w/ a grain of salt.

i ordered the spic basil chicken lunch special which included a choice of white or fried rice (went with white) and soup or salad (went w/ egg drop soup).

egg drop soup was ok but the peas and carrots in the soup were horrible. they just didn't taste real.

the spicy basil chicken was indeed spicy (on a 1-5 spicy scale, i ordered a 3) but did not have a hint of basil in it.  it just tasted horribly.  

on a good note (which earned it the 1-star), their thai tea was good.

i wouldn't call this place thai...far from it. most of the food on their menu is chinese."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years.  I compare all Thai Restaurants around the Country to this place and it's hard for find one better.  The food is amazing as well as the staff.  They have live music entertainment on the weekend. My favorite is the Yellow Curry Chicken and the Pepper Seafood Combo."}
{"text":"Pad Thai lunch special is fantastic with loads of Chx. If u ask for medium, I would say \"spicy.\" very busy at lunch but that's a good sign right?!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, eating something different every time, and have yet to have a meal I didn't find delicious. The egg rolls are the best I've ever had. Very reasonable prices, too, and the lunch special is a steal."}
{"text":"I tried Thai House after having recently returning from a trip to San Antonio where I was forced to go to a Thai place for lunch.  It was a highly recommended place and I loved it.  I immediately thought \"when I return home I am going to Thai House to try it.\"

I had high expectations that this would be a great place, but after one visit my expectations are much lower.  I ordered Tom Yum soup and the Spicy Basil Chicken.

Tom Yum soup was tasty and I did enjoy that.  If I had the taste for just that soup, I would order it again.  The Spicy Basil Chicken (same dish I ordered in San Antonio) was not good at all.  It was listed as a \"spicy\" dish, so to find it bland when it it supposed to be spicy was a major disappointment.  There was also too much of it pilled onto the plate.  You need room to move the food around to let it cool from just being cooked but to also give you room to separate and eat what you like and see the food.

I may try other menu items again sometime, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, would have a backup plan, and would not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Love the red chicken curry here!! Arrive early for lunch on weekdays - restaurant fills up fast."}
{"text":"I was in the area dropping in at the nutrition store in the same strip mall during lunch and thought I'd grab a bite to eat. I arrived was greeted and shown a table. The waiter a young kid asked if what I wanted to drink, I simply replied water is fine. A brief look at the menu I knew what I wanted. I waited for the waiter to return but he sat down behind the register playing with his cellphone. Just then the other gentlemen looked at the waiter to take my order but took it upon himself to do so. My appetizer arrived it was fresh rolls with dipping sauce. Before I could ask for chili sauce the gentlemen retreated behind the counter where the other young man was sitting. I had interupted them to ask for the chili sauce but another patron arrived so they blew me off as a waitress was attempting to assist me. She brings another set of silverware and I told her I asked for chili sauce as she left laughing to grab what I requested. The Papaya Salad I ordered was decent but for the price and service I received for my first experience at this place was anything but pleasant. To make matters worse after reviewing my account they added their own tip. I would never recommend this place to anyone if this is how they treat their customers and take they hard earned money without the customers knowledge. See attached images."}
{"text":"The fried chicken wontons were really good. The mein wonton soup was good as well. The beef wasn't the best quality. The place was pretty empty so service was pretty quick."}
{"text":"Been coming here for ten years and still dig it. The owner is awesome and almost always here killing it. I moves to the other side of town and still only come here for my thai craving. Tom ka gai, green curry, and pad se ew are the go toos. Get there fools!"}
{"text":"this place is small but they have great food,i love the spicy fried rice!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm a huge fan of chinese and thai food, so while house-sitting for a friend within delivery range I decided to try this place out!
I ordered the pad thai, my favorite dish, with a spice level of 7 (Hot!!) and shrimp. The noodles were very good, with a generous amount of peanuts. Since most places skimp on the peanuts first, I was extremely impressed. At first, I was disappointed in the spice level. For a level 7 it was pretty weak; my tongue wasn't even hot. Then, I mixed my pad thai up a bit more... I hit the chili vein. The heat from then on was extreme, not for the weak tongued. The shrimp, however, seemed a little bit soft, maybe undercooked.
I also ordered a side of crab rangoons. I LOVE crab rangoons. BUT, I was really disappointed. They had strange herbs in them, which were surprisingly pleasant. They also had onions in them, which was a big no-no for me. I cannot stand onions, and the strange mixture of the onions and the cream cheese was extremely unpleasant.
Delivery time was ok, and price was also ok. $23 for the two dishes, delivery charge, tax, and tip.
In the end, I would definitely order the pad thai again (maybe a 6), but wouldn't try th rangoons again."}
{"text":"Wanted to try something different for lunch so figured this looked good...well, the service was really slow. We actually had to flag down a waitress after sitting there for probably 10 minutes. When we got the food it was ok. I had the thai basil chicken and my friend the orange chicken. Mine wasn't bad but I've had much better. the orange chicken tasted very sweet. It's a good place to go for a fast lunch but don't expect quality food. It's \"fast food\" thai at it's slowest!"}
{"text":"This place is great with great prices. My boyfriend and I have never been able to take home left-overs. However, with these portion sizes its definitely needed. Always packed however they just knocked out a wall about two weeks ago so now they have even more seating! 

The chicken pad thai is absolutely delicious and you can order each dish with a spice level of 0-5."}
{"text":"Awesome lunch special, delicious and they give you more food. I like the chicken panang, and their Tom yum soup especially! I think I'm allergic to their chicken with chili mint tho, I get hives every time I eat it."}
{"text":"Alright, phai thai is the best Thai food right here.  I've already ordered it for many times. I truly love the place, however, I have to say something for customers' special instructions please guys!!! Each phai Thai I ordered u guys always put peanuts that I left special instruction on my order(no peanut please!!) but when I open my To-go box happily (can't wait to eat my phai thai) , I saw it did have peanut inside,oh my god it drove me crazy!!! Please pay attention to customers' needs,I really like Thai house food."}
{"text":"Wow so good!! Love Thai food and this place was so good. I was in the area and met a friend and I would recommend to others. Good prices and service and food. Enjoy the awesome weather and stop by for some really good Thai food."}
{"text":"Very good, but I like the nearby Thai Chef's Bistro a little better."}
{"text":"After the first time I ate here, I'm an instant fan!

Their lunch specials are pretty awesome! For $6.99 you get a choice of entree, egg drop soup, a chicken wing and an egg roll. The entree choices have the popular thai dishes - curry, pad thai, panang, thai bbq chicken and also a bunch of chinese food entrees - ginger chicken, chow mein, beef broccoli. 

I always crave their green chicken curry!! The last time, I thought I could handle a level 7 spicyness but it was soooo spicy! I usually can handle spicy food, but that was SPICAAAY! The next time I think I will get a level 5.

The staff are very nice and service is excellent. They sometimes have live music. Usually at night time. Very big space and a lot of seating areas. 

Their take-out service is great too! A definite fave of mine! I'm so glad they are located 5 mins away!"}
{"text":"Very plain place. Good Service. Was crowded on a Saturday afternoon around 2:00.
We got spring rolls, coconut curry with shrimp and beef with noodles. All where good.
Serviced piping hot and  jasmine rice with curry dish. 
This is a good Thai place to eat and have left overs. Portions are large."}
{"text":"Best Thai spot in town. The curries are delectable. The Pad Thai is the best there is. Definitely come to Thai House... You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Always eat or order delivery from here, always good food. But last night I ordered delivery for green curry with no spicyness since I have a bad stomach, but I ended up getting hot lava . Either way its usually a great place.."}
{"text":"I saw some good reviews of this place and wanted to give this place a try. The price was cheap and the food was delicious. I ordered Tom-yum soup, it was great and nice."}
{"text":"Absolutely Revolting!!! I went in today to place a takeout order. The menu descriptions looked intriguing, but what I received was disgusting. I ordered the Crispy Sweet Squid(Which is Calamari) and the House Lemon Chicken. When I went home and opened my plates. I couldn't believe what I saw. The lemon chicken was in the shaped of onion rings! I mean how is this even possible? They gave me a small cup of not even lemon sauce, but it taste like orange juice and pulp with a splash of lemon juice. Is this a joke I thought? The Calamari was breaded and fried very hard and when I bit into it the breading fell off and I was left biting into a chewy piece of squid! Yuck!! OMG I can't believe I spent $23 on this Crap. I will never go to this place again! You have been warned!"}
{"text":"Hard to find good Thai food in Scottsdale. This place is great. Totally reminds me of Char Thai in Tucson. $6.95 lunch special Mon-Fri (11am-3pm) is hard to beat. No surprise that the place is packed at lunch time. I had the lunch special with Panang (at a 4 out of 5 stars heat level), fried rice and soup of the day (egg drop.) The Panang was great, flavorful and they don't skimp on the chicken. Thai iced tea is made in shop, not from a bottle. Great little place, I will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"I just had the most AMAZING Thai food I will ever eat at this place called Thai House Restaurant. I attended the one in Scottsdale, Arizona. This restaurant had a lot of class. The experience started off rocky because the wait to be seated was over an hour long. I went at five pm so maybe that is why. The waiting room was very small and crammed for a rather large restaurant. The tile on the floor had a unique pattern to it. The ceiling had intricate designs and the walls had beautifully painted murals that really tied to whole theme together. 
 The atmosphere was very warm and welcoming and the staff was quite pleasant. My waitress was a lovely young woman. She never kept me waiting and checked on me frequently. She got a nice tip. The food, although, took a long time to make and arrive to my table. I'm not sure if it took a while because the place was so busy, or if the chefs were just taking their sweet time doing it, or if my waitress kept forgetting to grab my food. After about 30 minutes of waiting I finally got my food and I was soooo happy! I was relieved. It was delicious. Well worth the wait I would say and it wasn't pricy at all. It was a perfect portion of food for an amazing price. However, refills on drinks cost extra and I prefer restaurants that give free refills.
 I ordered the Mus-Sa-Mun which is a tender meat cooked with mus-sa-mun curry paste, coconut milk, potatoes, onions, and peanuts. The coconut milk really tied it all together in my opinion. It gave the meal a very interesting flavor and it was so sweet and juicy. I would definitely recommend this meal and the restaurant to everyone. I give this restaurant four stars."}
{"text":"The food at Thai House tastes very fresh... unusually so.  All the veggies are crisp and delicious... not soggy at all.  However, for a Thai restaurant the food is very mild.  I've eaten here several times, and each time I request \"extra spicy\" food... only to be disappointed.  I continue to return though, because of the fresh taste of the food, the great service and the reasonable prices.

The Kung Pao w/ Tofu is a good choice, as is the Spicy Eggplant (which isn't really spicy, but is very tender).  The egg rolls are tasty.

The range of the menu is about what you'd expect.  There isn't much out of the ordinary to try here, but all the standards are on the menu.

Overall, not a bad choice for a night out."}
{"text":"Always go here for Thai Food. Food is great service is par."}
{"text":"I come to Vegas every couple months and am always in search of that hidden gem.  The place that isn't flashy or touristy but that is the real deal.   The place that will show up on Triple D and I can tell Bleached Guy F. \"Yea bro, been there\"  this trip I got to find that.  Friends suggested Thai House and I was so ooooh glad they did.  Don't let the typical Vegas shopping strip location fool you...when you walk in you notice it's different.  It's big.  It has a stage that I hear parties can use for karaoke or that the owners son may come out to do a bongo solo (he's about 3 and adorable) or a local entertainer will have fun with the crowd.  

Kinda kitschy but the real gem is the food.  I ate with friends and we decided to do a family style deal to which the staff were more then happy to accommodate. ..in fact we let them choose the menu and it was the best decision I made in a long time.  From the Tom Cha  Gui soup that came with its own heating element to keep it hot...to the beef salad...to the green curry...to the   spicy chili and mint pork...we really liked everything.  The best and I'm embarrassed I can't remember the name (Shanghai noodles maybe...thin with chicken) they were great.  A big deal with Thai food is \"how much heat?\".  We went from 4 to 8 (which was a nice burn but you need to like heat).

I read some of the reviews that talk about it taking some time to get their food.  We asked for things to be brought out as they were ready and it worked out brillantly...they seem to care more about quality then speed which I am completely behind.  

So in short if you're in Vegas and want to find real good Thai food...in a family run and oriented restaurant...take the time to visit."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant one star because the delivery was actually early, it was convenient to order online, and finally the first bite of the tum yum soup was fairly good.  However, after eating the second bite it was just good and by the third bite it was ok and then by the fourth bite I wanted to throw up. 

The Red Curry Chicken was by far the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life.  It tasted like coconut milk straight with some added seasoning and the chicken thrown into a mess of a dish.  After traveling through thailand and other asian countries like Singapore (who knows how to do it right) I can sometimes be snobbish about my thai food.  Usually when I order thai food in the United States I keep in mind that it is not Thailand.  However, this restaurant is far beyond saving.  I would give it some kind of constructive criticism but the only thing that comes to mind is ... close the doors!"}
{"text":"Thai House is a great find! The restaurant is very clean and simple and the food was fresh and tasty (and affordable!). I had the Pad Thai and Spring Rolls. Both were gluten free. It's a great place for a week night date night with my husband. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai is excellent.  I like to order it with tofu and vegetables, Thai spicy.  While it's not always consistent, it's always delicious.  I've only eaten in the restaurant once (we normally pick it up) and the service is what you would expect for a hole-in-the wall type place (I don't mean that in a negative sense at all!)  

Being in North Scottsdale, I think people don't understand that a place like Thai House is not about 5 star service, it's about 5 star authentic food at a reasonable price, and it delivers.  In fact, for what you get, it's dirt-cheap!

Now that I'm not in the neighborhood anymore, this is one of the places I am really going to miss!"}
{"text":"Messed up the order and then proceeded to tell me that it was my fault. Apparently almond chicken sounds like orange chicken and she said I was lying. Okay! Yah I lied about what I ordered! Horrible customer service and the \"orange chicken\" I supposedly ordered was soggy and disgusting."}
{"text":"I would have given it 4 stars had I not realized that their calculations for my total have been wrong. I ordered three times this week! Just this week though... which is maybe why I decided to do the calculations myself.  Wish I had thought to do it sooner.  Think Ive been gypped around 2 bucks each time.  I even had to check if they raised prices again or if the state sales tax had changed. Neither has. They use an old calculator at the check out desk to which I assume they just hit a preprogrammed tax button so this could be the issue. I haven't brought it up to them yet but I will next time. So heed warning and BE SURE TO CHECK YOUR TOTAL AND SALES TAX.  

Despite the math, the food here is great!  One of the best thai places in LV.  Lherrrve their pad see ew. Its my fav. I normally get beef. Panang is sweet and savory. I always lick my spoon at the end. Its soooo good. Their spice levels are inconsistent though as with all thai places. I wish they could quantitate peppers or microscale the spice to be more consistent.  Like 1/4 a pepper for level 1. 1/2 a pepper for level 2 but thats just my thinking. 

Ive tried the singapore noodles which was bland.  Nothing special. 

Sweet and sour pork is awesome especially when fresh.  I love a good crispy batter.  Its the same for the lemon chicken. Crisp batter with a real lemon sauce.  Lemon sauce taste homemade. 

Roast duck is good.  Served over bok choy veggies.  I think its bok choy.

Thai tea is on the sweet side but I just wait for my ice to melt a little and all is well. 

Ive eaten more things from here but if I dont stop now Ill never be able to get to sleep. 

Thanks for reading :)"}
{"text":"Just ate at Thai House for the first time and I have only good things to say.  We ordered four different entrees and an appetizer, and everything was delicious.  The portion sizes are extremely generous, and the prices are very reasonable - especially given how much food you get.  (My pad see ew was $8.95 and I will easily get two meals out of it)  The orange chicken was the best I've ever had.  I cannot wait to go back here again!"}
{"text":"I must admit I fell into a bit of a funk when Malee's, my go-to Thai place within 10 minutes of home, closed at Desert Ridge. Where else could I get great Thai in a short drive? Luckily, I saw the Yelp praise for Thai House and tried it for lunch today. This place is authentic and delicious! The pad thai and panang chicken were both stellar! The full verdict will be in once I try their Tom Kha soup, but it was too hot for that on an AZ summer day. The service is quick and the atmosphere is nice (very light and contemporary for a Thai place). Thank you, Thai House...you are my new go-to!"}
{"text":"One of my comfort food venue ... especially when craving for the spicy kick and savory sensation .... 

This is probably my most frequent visit thai restaurant in the valley ... the food qualify is pretty good ... some of the dishes are very authentic (I used to live with a Thai family for years)  like their spicy eggplant, Basil stir fry, clear noodle salad and Tom yum (lemon grass soup) ....    However, not too much into their curry though, a bit of the sweet side for my taste but overall the food qualify is probably among the top 5 I have tried in the valley ....   and the price is very reasonable 

A side note, their spice level is from 1 to 5 .... I think it is of American standard , so 5 is just about what I call spicy ... nothing crazy suicidal"}
{"text":"I was craving for noodle and saw it on my GPS there is a mogolian bbq so I went to the area but couldn't find it .... and saw Thai house.... which pad thai will be a good fix too I thought. 
I ordered the pad thai to go, the service was fine and the order came out pretty quick, but the pad thai was overly sweet .... all I can taste is sugar and peanut sauce. I couldn't eat it at all and wasted 10 bucks .... Not sure how their other dishes are but I think I will save myself a trip next time"}
{"text":"Went to Thai House again today and ordered the Pad Kee Mao and Phrik King that prompted us to enthusiastically give Thai House 5 stars.  Unfortunately we were disappointed.  Neither dishes were as fiery and complex in flavor as the first time.  We ordered beef with both again and the beef was not as moist and tender as previously.   

However even though they were not 5 star dishes, they were still much better than most Thai meals we've had in the Valley."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here at least once every two weeks for dinner. The food is always good and the waitress always remembers what we like to order. My favorite is the panang curry with chicken and I order extra vegetables. My husband orders the Pad Thai with chicken. Yum"}
{"text":"Very good choices and portions from the lunch menu. Would return for a quick lunch if I'm in the mood for Thai close by. I would search elsewhere for a favorite Thai place though."}
{"text":"After a fun day in the sun, my friends wanted to grab something to eat and chose Thai House because it was close by. They think it's less American-ized than others and has authentic spices / flavors, making it their favorite Thai restaurant around. While I wasn't able to notice a huge difference between the Pad Se Eu at Thai House and my favorite spot at home in Charleston, the food was very good with nice portions. I tried a few bites of my friend's Panang Chicken as well and oh my gosh, it was delicious! I would come back again just to order that for myself."}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Small little hole in the wall place, but the food was incredible!  Portions were massive and the flavors were amazing. The prices are very reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food. Ordered the tom ka gai soup, yum woon sen salad and the mus-sa-mun curry for 2 people to share and have tons of leftovers. Food came out quickly and service was good."}
{"text":"Great place. Delicious Asian food! My favorite is the pad thai. Will be back. My coworkers and I love it!"}
{"text":"mmmMMMM my favorite thai place in las vegas!!!! I always get the pad thai here. SOOO YUMMY! I usually come here for the lunch special pad thai. It comes with fried rice, egg roll, chicken wing, egg drop soup and of course your entree...in my case pad thai! The lunch I think is either 6.99 or 7.99 I can't really remember but its sooo worth it! and it's not even expensive! They give you so much food to satisfy all 5 of your taste buds!
I've also had a crispy orange chicken and Mongolian beef which was a little salty but the crispy orange chicken was superb! =)

I've came here during dinner too, but the food doesn't taste the same from lunch and dinner. I think the cook/chef changes at night. So i only go during lunch now."}
{"text":"Horrible service this evening ... Walked in at 7 pm ... We occupied only table in restaurant ... Sat for 20 minutes while they took new take out orders ignoring us even though we told them we were ready to order ... Finally walked out"}
{"text":"Horrible first time with my family I sat down and seen 6 roaches within 15 minutes terrible I couldn't enjoy food knowing there's PROBALLY more in kitchen or where ever the employees seen me and my wife look at them they said somthing in Chinese and stepped on them and swep them up never will I be back roaches were coming out of there fast"}
{"text":"Now, I'm not a huge fan of thai cuisine but went there with some co workers who love thai food. Now their favourites usually are Thairama but they seemed to like the food here too. I played safe and ate the panang curry which I will say was good. The others had thai basil chicken, the red curry which were good too. The helpings are decent as well. 
If it can be taken to mean complimentary, if i am dragged to eat thai food, i will eat here. I also liked the interiors and the fact the place didnt have the strong aroma of thai food when you step in. Could be difficult to find just passing by ."}
{"text":"I think this will be my very last time to dine at this place. I do love their food. Tasted very good and very authentic. The girls are very nice working there too.

But it was not the first time I found something other than food in my plate. 

The very first time I found 
hair, which I understand, hair can be dropped in food very often. So I continue to go back because they do make good food. Plus it is just 3 minutes drive from my house. 

And today, I ordered some togo again. 2 items, I found a rock in my salad, the size of half of a peanut in my food. And I thought to myself, it is ok, maybe the rock is in the veggie and didn't rinse thoroughly. So I finish the first box.

And when I try to have my 2nd item, I saw this on the box. (Please refer to the picture) I am sure this is a piece of broken leg of some kind of bug. And I totally lose my appetite to even open that box. 

I thought I can put up with hair and rock in my food. But for the leg of some unknown insect sticking to a Togo box. I guess I just need to find other place that is more cautious about their food. It was sad cause they do make tasty food."}
{"text":"Got the pad thai and the spring rolls delivered; delicious.  Delivery was right on time"}
{"text":"It's my second time here. Last time I had the Duck Curry (excellent) and this time the Panang Curry Lunch Special. Wow! Fantastic. With a Thai Iced Tea less than $10."}
{"text":"The best pad thai in town (after my wifes :)))) ...big portions and reasonable prices...recommend this place"}
{"text":"We visited Thai House based on some postive reviews on YELP.  Overall we had a good dining experience, but would probably try another place the next time we want Thai food.  We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and Chicken & Shrimp Pad Kee Mao.  The Pad Kee Mao was excellent, as other reviewers have noted.  We both enjoyed the flavors and the spicyness.  The Pad Thai was not our favorite and I have had much better at other places in town.  It was overhwhelming on the noodles and had very little meat in the dish.  Also, we were a bit dissapointed that we were forced to order an entire entree for our toddler since they do not have children's portions on the menu."}
{"text":"Met a friend here for lunch today... We got there at 10:50 so we had to wait till the doors opened at 11:00 

The location is pretty small with 3 booths on each side and tables in the middle. Ordered wantons to start and I liked the sauce they served with them. Ordered spicy noodles with beef # 3 on the spicy. My friend ordered the curried chicken with coconut milk. It took about 5 minutes for the food to come and both dishes were very good and very fresh tasting as the basil they used really came through. Service was friendly. 

No complaints! Will definitely go back to get my Thai fix and will probably crank up the heat to a #4 next time I go. (spice ranges from 1 to 5)"}
{"text":"Last night I enjoyed a delicious Massaman Chicken Curry delivered to my home piping hot and seasoned exactly how I ordered. I will definitely plan on enjoying this dish and others again. The portion was very generous and full of chicken breast. The accompanying rice was more than I could eat."}
{"text":"I went to Thai House Restaurant with my cousin for lunch.. I like the inside, very quaint and cute.. The lunch portion is good amount for the price.. Servers are very nice and friendly... I got the lemon chicken and was pretty good, the rice seemed a little dry, but other than that, it's a good place and good for the money.."}
{"text":"Thai House is a gem.  Their lunch panang is ridiculously good.  Perfect hole in the wall with delectable choices."}
{"text":"Good Thai Food. Spicy levels, as in most places, has no correlation to a number. I've ordered spicy 6 multiple times and have had nuclear fire in your mouth hot to mildly bland hot.

Love the online ordering, so easy."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Get your fix for curry here. I've had a variety of dishes here and you can't go wrong. Green curry, red curry, spicy basil, panang, it's all yummy. I think the prices are good. You're looking at 10 bucks for a big bowl of red curry and a side of rice. Add a glass of Thai tea to cool off heat level 5. I might have to ask for a higher level of spice. I know... I have issues. Wait staff is attentive and the food comes out quick. Not a big restaurant, but I like that."}
{"text":"Ok food, nothing to write home about. Not sure why this place has been so highly rated. This area lacks a good Thai place, and in the absence of an alternate option, this will do as a filler."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place - large portions, very authentic. Service is cut and dried. I think they keep costs low by cutting out all the BS upon taking their time and fawning over you. Not so bad to keep me away. Maybe just have the servers dress a little nicer and hire one more to be extra attentive."}
{"text":"Best food for the price! Always a first choice! The staple dishes are curry noodles, eggplant and spring rolls!!"}
{"text":"This is where my love for thai food started! They have such amazing curry and pad thai, I always have the hardest time deciding between the two! Those are both part of their lunch special which is an awesome deal - soup or salad, entree and rice for $7. If your looking for lighter options, the seafood soup is also delicious.
The dinner portions are massive and you can probably feed 3 people with one entree which usually run around $10. It's a really good value and the food does not disappoint! Since I started going to this restaurant, thai food has become one of my favorite cuisines and this place is definitely my favorite place to eat it"}
{"text":"Thai house has been my favorite thai restaurant since I've discovered it. Not only do they have outstanding service but the food is always on point and the live music on Friday/Saturday night is quite enjoyable. As you walk in the staff are always right there to greet you and when not busy, able to seat you right away. For starters I always order the Pad Thai Noodles. Which has a small peanut taste but is also a bit tangy and spicy. It comes with your choice of meat such as chicken, beef, or shrimp. For my main course I always get the Penang Curry, again you have your choice of chicken, beef, or shrimp. This coconut curry dish is served with your choice of white rice, which is the way to go but if you wanna be a tad bit healthy, then you can go with the brown rice. This dish regularly comes out pretty spicy so my advice to you not so spicy lovers, make sure you request it at a level three on their scale of one thru ten. Overall I think all the food here is great, the two dishes I mentioned are always my go to meals especially on a cold nigh out. The prices are pretty decent compared to other thai restaurants in Las Vegas an Henderson. If you're looking for good food and wanting to venture out and try anything other than a burger and fries, why not enjoy the delicious thai quinine at the Thai House. I promise you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We really can't review the food because we left without trying it. When we arrived, the young man behind the desk was busy on his phone and ignored us until we cleared our throats a time or two. He did not look really excited to be interrupted. We were seated close to the kitchen. We waited for about 5 minutes or so for a menu (which looked much different from the online menu by the way). As we sat and waited, we could hear the kitchen staff in the back bellowing out the words to Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody. The atmosphere was rowdy in the kitchen, but SLOW in the dining room.  (very few diners) We decided we would not stay and be subjected to the noise and rudeness. 

We go out to eat to enjoy ourselves and that certainly was not the case here.  A big thumbs down on this Saturday night Thai-Awful experience."}
{"text":"Went to this place first time and honestly I was impressed by the taste and quantity! I go to another Thai place in Chandler and their quantity is tiny! This place was really good! We got Spicy Basil and Red Tofu pineapple curry! We were all so very happy and fully satisfied. We will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"It's unfair to compare Thai House with any other Asian American restaurant. Every other restaurant I visit, I'm comparing to Thai House. Not a single one has ever matched up!  The food is phenomenal. 

The owners of Thai House are super friendly and cook authentic thai food.  If you get a chance, read the newspaper article on the board about them and the restaurant. You'll have a new found appreciation for this place!"}
{"text":"Love their chicken panang! The service is ok, but the food makes up for it.  My fiancé has been coming here for years, and turned me into a repeat customer.  After 4 years, I have yet to find someone with a better panang."}
{"text":"Ordered Tom Kha soup, satay, fresh spring rolls, duck, pad se ew.  Everything was really good except for the fresh spring rolls which were mostly lettuce. Tom Kha was an excellent blend and balance. If this were in Berkeley, I'd rank it wi the Thai House there, which is my #1 spot for Thai in Berkeley."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. .service not so much. ..i will continue to eat here. .just don't expect to much from the service."}
{"text":"Great Authenic Thai restaurant I've dined in. The soup was great but was left with too many lemongrass and ginger in it...stuff that we cannot eat...Its there just for seasoning..I think its better to put only one piece of each in each bowl for decor...Other than that the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad thai with shrimp as well as the green curry with chicken.  Portions are huge and the price is right.  BUT, the shrimp was dry so it ruined the pad thai.  The green curry was good but my socks were not knocked off.  I eat out all the time, so am a bit fussy."}
{"text":"Simply put, the best kept Thai secret in town, just down the road from South Point. Their beef salad is perfect, tender beef, spiced perfectly, and the tangy dressing has just the right amount of fish sauce. They use a special kind of coconut milk, and fresh kefir lime leaves in their Panang curry, it is the single Best Bowl of Curry in Vegas  They have live music on the weekends, very nice wait staff, family run, just an all around pleasure to eat there, without the ridiculous cost of a Strip place."}
{"text":"First time visiting.   Had dinner -Mus-sa-mun curry was delicious.  Just finished left overs and flavor was great.  Service was a little slow when only one other table."}
{"text":"Great local Thai restaurant.  The owner (wife) is the cook and the husband handles the delivery and operations.  Very friendly and prompt service and great food.  Prices are reasonable as the portions are larger than average for a Thai restaurant (ie, Lotus of Siam).  Our favorites are the Thai Salads, curries and fish."}
{"text":"MY SEARCH HAS COME TO AN END! THIS IS THE BEST THAI FOOD I'VE EVER HAD! Now I have to travel to Thailand and try to top it. Everything here is crafted with passion, love and skill. The service is awesome and the atmosphere is very nice inside. There wasn't a thing I didn't like about this place. The curry , pad thai, all the seafood I've tried so far have been amazing! Their thai tea is wonderful as well! I cannot wait to go back! Pictures next time."}
{"text":"The yellow curry is my favorite in town! It is the perfect combination of sweet and spicy with great flavor. The portions are always big, so there's plenty leftover! The prices are fair too. They even have a weekday lunch special. I've also had chicken pad thai and it was delicious!  Their Thai tea is yummy too!"}
{"text":"I heard this place was really good so I drove 20 minutes from the hotel to get some food.  It wad getting late so I ordered for takeout.

Food was just coming out when I got there which was good timing.

The drive back was torturous as I had to smell the food the entire time back!  I have to admit that I was definitely speeding while sipping on the thai iced coffee.

The food was really good.  I have a few thai friends and know authentic thai food and this was right on the spot. 

My favorite is the ground chicken with mint leaves and chilis.  I got 2 out if 5 for the spiciness and it was perfect for my stomach.

I will definitely go here again to eat.  It was well worth the drive.

Now go get some!"}
{"text":"Been a consistent patron here for years. The food is always very consistent and very good. Everything is good and fresh but I love the curries, crab rangoons, white cabbage soup and amazing seafood dishes.  Typically exceptionally great, warm service and friendly smiles. The atmosphere is very casual and fun, having a locals / neighborhood feel that is refreshing as so many places come and go. Dishes are wide-ranging and authentic; not shying away from traditional Thai heat. I love their staff and their pickup and delivery services are exceptional (even offering online ordering).  My only two suggestions would be A. new cutlery and B. fresh rolls always made to order rather than sometimes made daily and put in the fridge -- which are still very good though. Will be back again and again and again no doubt."}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai 5 star spicy and it was excellent. Try the Thai Tea. It is a very unique blend of tea and some type of cream. Great compliment to the spicy food. Service was excellent, pricing great. Watch the hours they don't open until 4:30."}
{"text":"After traveling the world and sampling many Thai resturaunts my boyfriend and I both agree that the food at the Thai House is top notch! We typically take our meal to go as we really don't care for the tv carrying on while we dine. But our favorite dishes are the chicken Panang and the Pad See Ew! The sticky rice is delicious too! Nothing seems to disappoint except perhaps the spring rolls! I, personally, would give it 5 stars but I think there is room for improvement on their spring rolls and decor! My BF, on the other hand would give it a perfect score of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Five stars for noodle dishes and curry! Nice people at this location!  We go there several times a month."}
{"text":"I have had Panang all over the country (and the valley), and the Panang Chicken, level 5 spicy, at the Thai House is my all time favorite hands down.  It's a dish worth dreaming about.

They have awesome lunch specials during the week and it's a fairly small establishment, so they are usually full.  I recommend going a little before 11:30 to beat the rush.  We went a little closer to noon yesterday and had to wait, but it was only for a few minutes and well worth it.  The service is quick, so even when I do have to wait for a table I can still make it back to work within the hour."}
{"text":"The only Thai place I go to in the valley. I have been here twice. It's not a resto bar type of place if that is what you are looking for. However if you are liking for phenomenal Thai cooking, you have found it. 

I have tried many a Thai places before, and the Thai House nailed it. My favorite dish is the seafood penang curry with brown rice. They even offer you a spicy scale catered to your taste. From a spicy scale of 1-5, I go with 4. Not typical with other Thai places, my dish Comes out with ample amount of seafood. Lobster, calamari, scalps, mussels, shrimp ... A bowl big enough to share. However I've devoured all by myself both times. 

The place is clean, the service is prompt and the prices are very reasonable. I even recommended the seafood penang to the next table on my last visit. She looked over and was delighted by the smell of things, so I told her she must try it. She was not disappointed, she thanked me for the rec and looked as happy as a puppy eating away. 

Bathroom is well kept and tons of parking available. 

I'm going to make this my weekly thing!"}
{"text":"I was craving for some Thai food and found this little restaurant very close to me. It was kinda hidden in the big strip mall, look for a Chase bank, it's right next to it.

The menu is pretty standard like most of Thai restaurants, the price is definitely good for the amount of the food they offer. I had the Pineapple Curry (with shrimp), the portion was big enough to share between two. The curry was tasty, but with a lot of pineapples. My friend had the Pad Se Ew (wide flat noodles stir fry with meat and veggies), which was pretty good, and also a big plate too.We also shared the Satay (chicken strips on a stick), this was a-okay, the curry sauce all over was too much, didn't taste like it was off the grill.

The Thai tea on the other hand was less sweeter than most I have tried, so thumbs up!

I definitely will go back to check out more of the menu as I found a few of the noodle dishes seem to be good. They also got some good deals on the lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've had in a long time. Delicious!! Fast service. Perfect tasting fresh food. I made this my birthday dinner place."}
{"text":"Best. Thai. Period. Need I say more? Ok folks well first I have never ever known a Thai restaurant to be sparkling clean. But this is about as good as they come. The lunch specials are heaping portions win rice and soup and a drink for eight bucks and cannot be beat. I have had several things on the menu and not all are amazing. All are good and half or more are stellar. If you are hungry and down for some Thai pull in here!"}
{"text":"God awful exepriance here today. Long time customer who was screamed at by a waitress to never come back because I chose not to leave a tip. Came here many times  usually decent enough  service unitll today. I feel like every other industry the food service industry is performance based. To treat a customer like that is wrong we were even followed out the door and told to never come back. Needless to say Thai house ahas lost a customer . I would encourage folks to co sided the moltirude of other fantastic Thai options on Scottsdale and not offer their patronage to the likes of the folks working here ."}
{"text":"The absolute worst service I have ever encountered. As I sat in a booth the hostess pushed the neighboring table into our table and it pinched my arm as I was sliding to sit in the booth chair. I looked at her and asked her why she was pushing our tables together. She didn't  and wouldn't answer. I told her no that i didn't want two tables pushed together. Of course being a normal human being, a frequent restaurant diner, and a seasoned chef I am wondering to myself why because she did not ask this table just nearly crushed my wrist. Lol.

Our \"server\" came and got our drink order, brought our drinks, and took our food order. Pleasant enough and timely. Ok so I am hoping at this point of service, they may redeem themselves. WRONG. So wrong...

Alrighty, so its an asian restaurant, the food comes out a different times. Hey I am Asian so I can say that. Plus its the truth. I sat there with my food for at least 5 minutes before my fiance gets his. We're ok with that. My soup tasted ok and the larb was fine. Neither were the best I had ever had but it was fresh and acceptable. 

My larb and tom yum were both pretty salty so after I tasted I thought would ask for sticky rice to help cut the salt. I waited. I waited. I lifted my hand as if waiting for teacher to pick me to eagerly answer the question. Nope no such luck. I stared down  the service staff waiting for any type of acknowledgement and nothing.

I kinda gave up and made a couple snide remarks to my fiance regarding the inept staff. I answered emails for my business MiChefsNetwork.com I went on facebook, linkedin, and instagram. My fiance finished his vegetarian fried rice which was very good. I still had been waiting for an opportunity to ask for rice and napkins. Because we never received napkins. I discovered this after i dribbled some salty soup onto my chin. 

Finally, the dumb girl came by to fill our water glasses. I told her i have been waiting since i received my food to ask if could get a bowl of sticky rice to go with my soup and salad. Do you know what her answer was?? Get this, \"We were busy. Do you want it now?\" This response was the wrong one to give a hungry paying customer. I informed her we were paying customers. I told her would want boxes, the check, and napkins since we never received any. 

Breaking it down: She said she was too busy. They had 5 other tables 4 deuces and 6 top the had already been eating before we sat. Why in the hell would you move tables together if not asked? Why couldn't she have waited until i sat in my banquette and cleared my limbs before she pushed the table? 

These are questions that will never be answered. 

I gave them 2 stars because i took into account I had been there 2 other times because the food is acceptable and is in close proximity of home. But now I will certainly think twice before going back. Good people are really hard to find. Service is everything."}
{"text":"Lady at the front (I don't remember her name) was extremely rude. I was picking up an order and I asked for no peanuts and no cabbage, while I was making sure the order was correct with the lady helping me, while I was in the middle of making sure, the other (terrible) lady rips the receipt off the back and angrily says \"HERE, IT SAYS ON THIS RECEIPT YOU CAN READ FOR YOURSELF!\" I'm guessing the people who work there most likely know who I'm talking about, and I really hope she gets talked to about this because you just lost a customer."}
{"text":"There is a lot of great Thai food in Vegas.  My first trip here was impressed very friendly staff, and quick service.  I wanted a quick and tasty dinner with out breaking the bank.  I enjoyed the basil chicken, they use ground chicken which absorbs more or the sauces flavor.  I had a Thai beer in a frosted mug only 4 bucks! My entree was 12 dollars and fed me for dinner and lunch the next day.  I will be back for sure.  Nice ambiance, on Wednesday and Friday there is  a little lounge act, he was quite good, music starts at 7pm till close."}
{"text":"High quality, reasonably-priced Thai food?  Check.

Quick, efficient, friendly service?  Check.

Variable levels of spiciness that ensures that dishes don't need to be doused in chili sauce, or alternatively consumed with eight glasses of milk?  Check.

Good Thai iced tea?  Check.

Those are really the only criteria that I have for a Thai restaurant, and Thai House meets them all.  It's light on atmosphere and decoration, but once you have the food, such concerns don't even factor in.

Minus one star to me, for waiting a year and a half before trying this place."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite until my last order for pickup.  I ordered and my dude picked it up.  They gave us the wrong order.  When he arrived home I found that nothing in the bag was my order.  I called and they told me ......HE SHOULD HAVE CHECKED!  Well he didn't even know what I have ordered for us.  THEY SHOULD HAVE CHECKED.  i had to drive down (roughly five miles) and collect the correct order.  AND young man at the counter insisted again that it was my friend's fault..  Good grief Charlie.....just say you are SORRY and stop blaming your customer for your boo boos.  Plus, call one of their other store and passed this info on.  Was told they would ask the owner to call me. Hahahaha...no call of course."}
{"text":"Quality not up to par, dry chicken / dry shrimp.  This does not match the reviews I read.  This is basically a cafeteria.  I will not come back with so many other great Thai places so close"}
{"text":"Great Thai! Enjoyed Massamun Curry
not too spicy, just as a I asked for.
Pad Thai delicious as well  and Thai salad w/yummy peanut base dressing!
Low on atmosphere but food more than makes up for it. Friendly staff!
Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food but worst service. Some of the people waiting tables here do not seem to like their job. May be they should think of getting other jobs. Majority of the times they mess up the order and worst one time when I was trying to request something that they missed the waiter was making faces as if he was disgusted to serve me. People like that have no business waiting tables."}
{"text":"Nice service but very heavily condimented platters. And I KNOW that Thai food is very flavorful. Flavorful and condimented are different. I had the Tom Kha Gai soup and the chicken didn't taste fresh. Also, the broth was very condimented. I had the eggplant with beef and again heavily condimented. I wish they could've won me over with at least one of the platters."}
{"text":"I get lunch here a lot.  The hostess if very friendly, and didn't take her long to realize what my drink of choice is (she doesn't even ask anymore haha).

Great value for all the lunch specials, great flavor, always consistent.

Try it!"}
{"text":"Just one of those places, non-descript, but all about the food.  Lack of service can be very frustrating especially during workday lunch hour.  Best Pad Thai, Penang."}
{"text":"My in-laws were visiting for the weekend and wanted Thai food.  We haven't really gone out for Thai in a while and were looking for a restaurant close-by that would take 7 people on a Saturday night.  We found Thai house through Yelp and were not disappointed!  The servings were huge  - we took home about 1/2 our family style meal so will be ordering less next time.  The pepper beef was rich and tender (very peppery though, which we liked) and the curry was fabulous. Everything was very good and each of us had our own favorite. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Was craving something spicy, with noodles and a little itty bit sweet. I thought this place was good, however my wife loved it. We got the spicy noodles. I like that you can select how spicy you want it. The noodles were about an inch wide, which I was surprised with but very yummy. We got it with beef and there was a lot of beef, and it was nice and lean. Overall yummy flavor, good amount of meat, and will eat there again, definitely."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to like this small busy place but just could not. VERY poor service -- we ordered 4 items and only got 2 due to waiter and kitchen SNAFUs. Food was mediocre. Keep moving, nothing to see here."}
{"text":"Another great find. Thanks yelp. Tom ga Kia soup is delicious and pineapple fried rice full of fresh ingredients. Small place. Friendly staff. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Lunch specials to include soup, egg roll, pot sticker, entree and rice for $7 can't be beat. Food is tasty and entree cooked to order. Servers are attentive. Not fast-food service. This place is a keeper. Pad Thai is exceptional."}
{"text":"Stopped in a Thai House for a late lunch, after going to GolfSmith which is right next door.  Small place but very clean, comfortable booths.  Most importantly food is fabulous!  My friend got the Pineapple Curry which was so delicious, lots of good sized shrimp and chunks of pineapple and bell pepper in a yummy curry sauce.  I wanted something light so got the Pan Fried Noodles Gai Kua, light flat noodles with chicken, scallions, green onion in a light clear sauce.  Wonderful! I got it 1 out of 5 spicy but it probably was a 2--I ate it all.  No leftovers to take home.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The ambience is ok, but the food is GREAT!
Have been there many times, it is inexpensive, easily accessible, and very good!"}
{"text":"2nd best thai food in town expensive but you get alot of food. I always get the chicken chili mints always good i just need to tell them easy up on the damn vegetables though"}
{"text":"We are still coming here and still enjoying the authentic Thai food made from scratch at this family run business."}
{"text":"The Thai House is great! Its all about the pad thai and their soups here that make me come back again and again. Whenever I go to a new thai restaurant, the first thing I do is compare it to the Thai House. Every single time it hasn't matched it. If you go here, get the pad thai and get the siam noodle soup to go. Two of the best dishes."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! The waitress got our order wrong and did not bother to come and apologize. Food is not authentic. How can you run out of cilantro?! For a Thai restaurant? Never coming back!"}
{"text":"I've just went here and this place is very good! The pad Thai noodles tasted awesome and so did the spring rolls. The service was fine, no complaints. The environment was relaxing and calm. The only reason I give four stars is because it's a little pricy and I expected a bigger container of noodles for the price. Besides price the food itself-excellent."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Food is is really tasty!  It's our favorite Thai restaurant to go to.  We've brought friends and family here and they too love it!    Highly recommend Larb, Tom Kha (shrimp), Beef Panang, and Thai Tea with cream!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke. Never took our order, made us sit there with no water for more than 25 mins. We eventually just got up and left. How is it that you guys have 4 stars? Hopefully there will be another Thai restaurant opening somewhere close by because you guys truly don't have any customer service skills whatsoever. It was completely not busy at all. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the food here. I'm a huge curry fan and especially love their green curry and pineapple shrimp curry. yum!!! :-D I've been to other Thai restaurants in the near area, and it is hard to find a place that you really love their flavors and what they bring to the table! Plenty of flare in their cooking and the spices make it so tasty and savory."}
{"text":"Food is great and service is friendly! My food came out really quick and everything tasted good. The red curry is great"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent prices, and amazing food. Simply the complete experience.  Everything on the lunch menu seemed to be excellent and satisfying for the entire group. 

The speed at which the food was served was borderline insane. Within 3 minutes the soup came out (in a packed restaurant!). 5 minutes after that the entrée came out.  I had the pad thai. It was great.  I definitely recommend this to anyone in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food. They had an asparagus with shrimp special that was outstanding, and the other dishes were good as well with nice sized portions. Don't come here for the décor, it's just a local place with good service and good food. FYI no alcohol served."}
{"text":"Great food!  Thai house is consistently delicious every time I go.  Nice portions and very tasty.  This is definitely a hole in the wall type restaurant, but well worth the visit.  I've tried several dishes on their menu, but my favorite is the yellow coconut curry.  The customer service is good enough.  They seem to always be open, even on some holidays.  Definitely one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"I live in Tucson but was in Scottsdale with my mom for a few days. I was craving Thai food and my mom agreed we'd check out Thai House for dinner, as it was just a few minutes down the street. I'm so glad we did!

The restaurant was small but felt roomier because of vaulted ceilings and cleverly placed mirrors. The decor and lighting was pleasant and not too bright (as some Thai restaurants I've been to have unpleasant fluorescent lighting). 

We ordered 3 out of 5 spiciness level for Gang Ka-Ree and Pad Thai, both with chicken. OH MY WORD. SO delicious! The curry was the best I've had, and it's a dish I try at most of the Thai restaurants I go to. It was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet from the coconut milk. The Pad Thai was great too, but that usually is not hard since it's such a popular and \"Americanized\" dish.

My mom and I both ate way too much but it was worth it. We should have ordered one dish to share rather than two. Our hotel room didn't have a refrigerator, so unfortunately we couldn't bring our leftovers home. So sad... 

We had to wait a bit for our bill because the restaurant was extremely busy by the time we finished our meal, but we weren't in a hurry so it was no big deal. Servers were friendly and kind.

Next time I'm in Scottsdale I will be visiting Thai House again--with an ice chest for leftovers if necessary!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Tom Ka soup and the Crab Rangoon were the prettiest I've ever seen and they tasted better than the looked. Amazing food and staff, I can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"Never disappointed! Great flavors, portions, and composition! Prices are reasonable and take out/dine in service has always been excellent. Yai gai kwor and the fried banana with coconut ice cream are two of my favorites."}
{"text":"Wow! Finally, good food fast. Prepared to specifications and flavorful. They don't skimp on veggies and not greasy. Delivery was fast - food was still hot! So glad to find them."}
{"text":"The food is not bad, but it certainly isn't good. Oh, the service is good, and the atmosphere acceptable considering the neighborhood.

The best thing I had was the egg drop soup. From there everything went downhill.
 
Oh, I'll admit the spiciness is actually spicy: a ten is a ten, nice and hot, but I'm not sure what the odd taste was in both my Pad Thai and in my fried rice, maybe the oil, which could have been of poor quality or old; I'm not sure which, though the taste was repulsive enough that I only sampled either dish.

I can think of at least four nearby Thai restaurants that serve better food, though perhaps at a slightly higher price.,"}
{"text":"The food was ready for take out in 15 minutes which was nice. After the good reviews, I expected better food. Average at best."}
{"text":"Cockroach IN food. Disgusting. They comped meal,  but it wasn't worth it. I'm feeling queasy!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but the food was overly greasy, the meat was tough and the depth of flavor just wasn't there for Thai food."}
{"text":"Great good! However the fish in the lobby need a bigger tank! There are 3 very large fish in a very small tank. It seems like animal cruelty and I won't eat there again because those poor fish. Get a bigger tank!!!!"}
{"text":"Although I'd rate a few thai restaurants in the Las Vegas valley ahead of this place, I visit this place the most. I live close by, prices are nice, restaurants is usually clean, they have live music performers sometimes, and  their staff is friendliest in town. 

As far as the food goes, this place just does not make sense. You could order an item one night, and have an excellent experience, and order the same exact item the very next night ( which ive done several times), and be disappointed. The chicken fried rice, papaya salad, and tom yum gai are examples of this.  Ive had more great experiences then bad ones. Now that the weather is getting colder, ill be visiting quite often for their soups. I like this place!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good,
Here's my favorite items:
Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp-A-mazing broth!
The only negative is loose lemongrass you have to pull out of your mouth.
However the flavor is worth the work.

Duck Salad-A special off the board
Tangy dressing and crisp salad. Good portion of well flavored duck

Spicy Eggplant-OMG good!
This I have ordered with chicken and pork.
Great Thai Basil flavor and they will gladly modify to suit your taste."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the price.  The masuman curry is my favorite.  And great spring rolls."}
{"text":"Yeah, they just opened a new Thai House on Shea and 70 Street.  
480) 991-5004

It's is pretty tasty and they have lunch specials too."}
{"text":"This is a great place for Thai food. I went there last week with my husband and his parents. Three of us ordered different curries and my husband ordered the spicy noodles. We all enjoyed our meals. I ordered mine as a 3 on the heat scale and it was perfect. Spicy, but yet I could taste the flavors of the red curry dish. The restaurant itself is small and in a strip mall but it is very clean. The staff gets an A+ for being attentive. The only thing I was a little annoyed about is that we received one dish for the rice between 3 of us and were charged for additional rice. Overall, I will be returning for some great thai food!"}
{"text":"We actually showed up right at opening, 4:30pm, on a Thursday. We started with sodas, Pepsi products woohoo!! Seriously! And we also got Thai tea, yummy! They came to us quickly. We got wontons and egg rolls for an appetizer. They are very good. The wonton has a huge piece of chicken in it! Nice surprise. The egg rolls are fried perfectly. The sauces for both were light and just the right amount of sweetness. They showed up quickly as well and  the perfect temp. 
The entrees: sweet and sour chicken, drunken noodles, pad Thai, rand nar and chow mien. The portion size was perfect yet still on the slightly larger side. The waitstaff were courteous and quick with refills and to take used plates. 
The restaurant is clean and quiet. Not so quiet that you feel uncomfortable speaking with your guests, but just the right level to enjoy your meal. 
We would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is deeeelish!  I just ate at a totally mediocre Thai place tonight because I didn't want to make the drive to Thai House and I will not make that mistake again!  We just discovered this place in August and have eaten here at least three times.  Reasonably priced and absolutely delicious.  The curry dishes, the noodles, all wonderful!  Each time we've been we've gotten recommendations from the staff and have not been disappointed once.  This place may look a little vacant when you show up but we learned on our first visit that they do a lot of take out business.  If you like Thai, this place is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Asian girl approve. mmm yuuum."}
{"text":"This Thai place is my ALL time favorite in Phoenix! Very authentic and very delicious mouth watering meal! Your tummy will feel soooo  satisfied after eating at this place!  It's definitely a must place to go for Thai cuisine!"}
{"text":"The food is always good. Well I am speaking of Panang and Pad Thai.
We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in yesterday. 
They moved the wall on the right side, which opens the room up and are adding more tables. The floor has been replaced in a nice new plank style. 
Our visit is always about the food that we returned for and now I feel better about the atmosphere. 
The food always comes out fast and the temperature hot. The medium spicy was just right. Our guest ordered mild and hers was perfect. Food is authentic Thai.
I have only gone here for lunch. There is a sign in at the front door if need and our wait was only about 10 minutes. At least the addition of more tables will make the wait sitting down. I am so glad to see this improvement."}
{"text":"I just ordered food from here no less than 10 mins ago and the food was disgusting. First, upon the arrival of my food the deliver driver was careless with my order so that all the sauce that my food was cooked in spilled out of the container and was all in the bottom of the bag soaking my rice and soup in it's juice. So i ordered the Chinese's broccoli with salty fish and it was disgusting. The broccoli was extremely greasy and the fish was over cooked and hard and still had PLENTY of bones left in it. Then i order the egg flower soup which . . . \"sigh\" . . . was so sad it can't even be called soup. It had absolutely no flavor and was EXTREMELY thick and gooey. I just smh and pushed it to the side, giving up on tonights dinner. Most disgusting and unsatisfying thai food I have ever had in my life. The best thing that came out of my order was my thai tea ."}
{"text":"This place is a disappointment.  I ordered thai green curry,  and it was not green.  I then ordered the pineapple curry,  but the curry sauce was bland. To top it all, the waitress was trying to tell me that green curry was green. What an insult. I am used to the Bay Area/SF Thai restaurants, and very disappointed that we went to a 4 star reviewed restaurant that I feel did not deserve. 1 star is more like it.  Rip off."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here or ordering from here via delivery since 2008. It is the only place we order and get our thai food. I love the red curry and recently got hooked on the green one. The food and service has always been excellent."}
{"text":"Small place but kept clean and the people are always friendly. The food was exceptional. All of their curries are very flavorful. The satay is bright yellow with nice grill marks--best I've had. Only downside is that they are closed sundays."}
{"text":"Great food! Pad Thai is the best i've found. Great place for date. Thumbs Up."}
{"text":"Ok I am not crazy about spicy food and was worried. I ordered level 1 and it was delicious. I had the lunch special with Panang Chicken and the sauce was creamy and very tasty. I also drank the Thai Tee and it was amazing. I have been there many times and visit often when we are in town. Love it! If you don't like it fiery hot just ask for number 1 or zero. People are nice and helpful. Very, very crowded at lunch time but the wait for a table was around 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Not impressed with Thai House. My husband didn't get the dish he ordered (and the chicken he was served was so dry) and I found a rubberband in my Panang Chicken. I love Thai food but NOT this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is truly the best Thai food I have ever tried.  All of the dishes are very authentic and appeal to all palates as you can tailor the level of spiciness to your taste.  The service is very quick and the staff is always very friendly.  Highly recommended to say the least and please do not limit yourself to one particular dish as everything on the menu has a wonderful experience to offer!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst customer service I have ever seen. My wife and I placed a delivery order on Tuesday. They stated it would take 1 hour for the food to be delivered. After 1 1/2 hours my wife called and asked when we could expect our food. They said it was on the way. 45 mins later I called myself and they stated it was on the way and the manager was personally delivering it. When the manager arrived after 2 hrs and 45 mins of waiting I confronted him on why it took so long? He stated he wasn't late and I asked him what his sheet said he continued to argue with me and said he could just leave with the food. I said I would pay for the food but I would never use them again. The MANAGER then proceeded to curse me out after taking my money. I will absolutely never use this restaurant again and plan on reporting them to the BBB. I have never seen a manager of a company not apologize for being at fault. The food is good but not worth the horrible customer service.

{"text":"So I ordered using their online website. I ordered sweet and sour and I put no onions in special instruction. Next I also ordered pad se ew with no chinese broccoli, but bean sprouts instead. And when I got there, I have to say: the interior is pretty amazing and the servers were dressed neatly. Now comes the problem: so I got home with my food. To make long story short: the sweet and sour has onions and the pad se ew has broccoli still. Not fully disappointed, but also not fully impressed. By the way: the  beef in the pad see ew has a rubber texture to it, but really no tastes to it. I just chew and chew. It's kind of like gum, but with no flavor."}
{"text":"I LOVE the lunch specails here... Panang Chicken is my favorite mmmm mmm And you can adjust your spice level, I always have to tone it down just a little on the spice!!"}
{"text":"Best Tom Ka Gai (sorry if I didn't spell that correctly) I've ever eaten.  Other dishes were not quite as good.  
Friendly service and a clean place.  One of my Asian 'go to' places."}
{"text":"Since we moved to Scottsdale four years ago, we had been looking for a neighborhood Thai restaurant that we could go back to again and again, and we found it with Thai House.  The food is consistently good.  The servers are friendly and knowledgeable.  They never forget to ask you \"how spicy\" on a scale of 1 to 5.  The red curry is my favorite, and they don't mind making it without bell peppers for me.  I ask for some green beans or broccoli instead and they are always accommodating for me!  A huge thumbs up!!!!"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant provided the worst service I have ever received in Las Vegas.  I entered the restaurant and waited 5 minutes then I decided to sit at a table b the restaurant was 35% full.  I waited.   No one came to my table.  So I went to another table and told the manager where I was sitting. I decided to use the restroom and then when I got to my table I waited for another 5 minutes.  I finally got a waiter after waiving.  Then I asked about some items on the menu like any decent customer would.  To my surprise the waiter was quite rude.  It was my first time in this restaurant and he made me feel like a dumb idiot without knowledge about the menu.  

The restroom was filthy and a dust pan and broom was sitting right in the middle of the dining floor.  The tables I sat on were sticky and the restaurant smelled like old food.  Yuk!!!  

I am a businessman with 24,000 monthly regular customers.  I could have given them 50 more customers a month but being treated like a rotten customer during his first time is not a good experience.  

The chubby short haired Thai waiter has to be fired or retrained.  

I am never coming back.  

This business will close in a short time."}
{"text":"Hard 3.5 stars. Food is FANTASTIC! Absolutely no complaints whatsoever. I return 2-3 times a month for their panang curry or pad thai. Why only 3 stars? Their service. Their service is dismal. I had to ask to have my water filled 3 times and for my check. They don't really check on you at all. Alas, even though the service is terrible I keep returning because of their great food! Maybe I will just do take out strictly in the future. Still great food though!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! As a vegan, I really appreciate that they have plenty of options that work for me. And their portions are absolutely huge - easily enough for two very large meals. 

Their prices are extremely low too, providing a huge bang for the buck. And the staff are very friendly. 

This is one of my very favorite places to eat in Scottsdale for those reasons. 

I do find that it's sometimes a little cold and noisy, but at such a low price it's hard to expect perfect surroundings. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered take out. I ordered chicken pad thai and my husband picked up our food. When he got home we realized they gave us the wrong order. When we called to let them know they were very rude and unaccommodating."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's a chain, but I they are one of my favorite curry places (I like panang and gang ka ree). Everything is good, but the curries seem to skimp on veggies. The salad with noodles is also very good."}
{"text":"Love, love, love!   Ordered food to go.  Have eaten here many times, delicious food and excellent service!  Very reasonable lunch menu!  Best Thai food in Scottsdale"}
{"text":"I just ordered for delivery and I was charged $47.05 including a $5 delivery for 2 items. Sweet and sour tilapia and shrimp in lobster sauce. I was told $27.05 over the phone. The serving portion is really small. It's my first time ordering from this restaurant and it will be the last."}
{"text":"Dinner here or take out two times in one week while in Scottsdale. Pad Thai Chicken and Kung Pao Pork. Both dishes very good.  Both large portions. Will definitely stop in again when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This is a nice small Thai restaurant that we tried while looking for a nice lunch place mid-week. We were pleasantly surprised with the quality and value.

I had the curry noodles (47) and the fried tofu appetizer, both of which were excellent, served very hot and a good-sized portion.

Ambiance is not the specialty of the place, but overall I recommend this place for an excellent, quick Thai meal."}
{"text":"What a great find! My new favorite Thai Restaurant in Vegas.
Great menu, good prices, friendly efficient staff. The chef gets the spice right! They ask how hot 1 to 10, when I told them 12 they made it 12!
Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great lunch selection, big portions, inexpensive, fresh food, fast service.  I'll be a regular lunch time customer from now on, wish I'd found it sooner.  I like the 0-5 level on desired spiciness idea too."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere and decor. Quick delivery, reasonable prices, and tasty dishes. 

I am visiting from Georgia and will return when I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Wow, I had the panang curry and the thai fried rice, and both were spot on.  Really- among the best panang curry and thai fried rice I've had!  And of course the thai iced tea was delicious :-)"}
{"text":"Greatest Thai restaurant by far in Las Vegas! Located in the southeast part of town. Good place for locals or if your visiting and want to get away from the vegas scene. 

I've been introduced to this nice cozy spot from a friend couple years ago and I've been coming back ever since...why??? Two reasons:

1. Fantastic customer service - every time you walk in, you are always greeted with a smile and an up beat enthusiasm. Very friendly! and are on top of their game. 

2. The food is delicious! - I always order Pad See-ew (excuse my spelling) with tofu that I substitute instead of meat. TRYING to be on a diet. lol. Also the Kung Pao Chicken. The server always ask me how spicy? I say the spiciest! My friend and I are literally perspiring eating it, but we love spice. tssss! 

This restaurant has a karaoke stage and small dance floor. Every now and then they have someone sing. But I don't think I'll ever come to dance though. \"just here for the food!\""}
{"text":"Lunch #11 with fried rice and soup.
Heat level 4.
The second best thing to a nooner.
The first best being Quarters BBQ in Albuquerque.

INSIDE SKINNY PRO-TIP:
Spread out your rice, then spoon chunks from the curry onto the rice.
Everything will cool faster for you to eat sooner.
Add liquid to your rice as desired, in stages.
Be aware that the red chile flakes settle to the bottom sometimes. 
THAT is the secret mouthful!
Put the remaining rice into your curry bowl. ENJOY.
PLEASE DO NOT WASTE THIS PRECIOUS GOLD. :)"}
{"text":"The noodles were good but the chicken had a weird taste. The staff doesn't really speak English and couldn't understand my order. I was charged extra when I shouldn't have been due to the language barrier."}
{"text":"Great Lunch menu! Affordable and good portions. I had the red curry chicken and was very satisified. Will stop by whenever I am around the area for lunch."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I've been in alot of Thai restaurants, and i would have to say this is gotta be the worst one ever. I went here because of the four star rating but im wondering how it got that... the food  is no where close to the thai restaurant that im used to. Maybe because i got spoiled to the quality of food from San Diego.  i dont recommend this place... the service was bad too, our food orders came back wrong, but at least they took it off the bill. Thai tea was ok, but they have no boba."}
{"text":"I love this place! We moved on this side of town a couple months ago and we love Thai food so needless to say it was a priority to find a new Thai place. The staff is friendly and the portions are big enough to share (if you are feeling generous haha) my favorite is the kung pao chicken and the mongolian beef. The restaurant is pretty big and has a lot of seating or if you rather eat at home they also deliver."}
{"text":"This Thai food is to die for! Our family favorite. I miss the awesome Thai food from when I lived in Thailand. Thai house off Pima & Hayden is great. Not exactly completely authentic, but close. Try the Panang Chicken curry, Pad Thai & Tom yum soups! I typically go with spice level 3. Absolutely delicious. Can't say the same for the Thai house on Shea. They are at most 3 star for the food & 2.5 for service."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here looking for some good Thai food in the area.  I chose to get shrimp pad thai medium, which is my go to selection for Thai food.  My fiance ordered chicken fried rice medium.  The noodles and spice level weren't bad in my pad thai, but the shrimp which had the tails on, were very chewy and definitely didn't seem very fresh.  Overall, it was just so so and a bit disappointing compared to the other great reviews on here.  My fiance did enjoy his fried rice and would probably rate this 3 stars vs. my 2."}
{"text":"Ownership epitomizes business ethics and customer satisfaction!

After my two star review a few weeks back I received a very apologetic email from the owner apologizing for our unpleasant visit. What a nice surprise! The owner seemed to really care for my satisfaction and informed me that they found my credit card transaction and was not going to be charged for my lunch.
He invited me back to The Thai House to give them a second chance. 
This kind of response is what is lacking in business today. I am very grateful for Yelp being a catalyst for business success and customer satisfaction. Thanks to Yelp, I look forward to take the ownership of The Thai House up on their offer and coming back and experiencing the food and service I once loved."}
{"text":"Delivery was fast. The food was great. I had (1) order of Yellow Curry with Tofu (level 6 spicy) and (1) Chicken Pad Thai (Level 1 spicy). Both dishes were really good. We will order from here again."}
{"text":"sorry, wrong restaurant. I don't know how to delete the review, so I modified it and gave it a neutral 3-star."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely AMAZING! There food were all at an affordable price. I took my siblings out to eat and they all loved it. We had beef pad thai, shrimp pad thai, vegetarian spicy noodle (which was delicious) and vegetarian curry ( I don't remember which one it was). 

Veg. Spicy Noodles: 
We got it with vegetables and tofu and it wa delicious. We had the spicy rate 1. It was my first time trying it! 

Veg. Curry: 
I LOVED IT! The soup tasted so gooood!!! Everything!! For spicy we did 3. 

Definitely coming back when I can!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food, and large portions!  I can always finish an entire order of chicken curry and rice. This time I took half of mine home. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We live off Shea just west and have driven by for over 3 years without venturing in...our loss.  This place is a hidden gem!  Still talking about our meal 3 hours later.  Website menu pricing is spot on and updated. Started off with Satay and loved the peanut sauce and cucumber/onion side. Next Thai Wonton Soup for me (piping hot and overflowing with wontons and veggies) and Tom Yum Koong hot and sour soup for my husband which he loved. For entrees, I had the Chef's special of shrimp, broccoli and asparagus with brown rice (large portion; took 1/2 home) and my husband had Pad Kee Mao (spicy noodles) which he raved about.  We finished off with the seasonal fresh mango with sticky rice and I want more! Definitely will be making this a regular spot and since it's so close to home I'm sure we will be getting take out as well.  Only wish we had visited sooner..."}
{"text":"Thai house has great food and great service. I have been going here for 2 years and I have never gotten a bad meal. Thai House has tons of choices and their all great. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food...
We've been coming here for 7 years or so BUT....
I was charged .50 tonight to have no ice in my thai tea....!!!!
Petty!!!"}
{"text":"Thai House is a 2 minute drive from my work. I eat here probably 2 or 3 times a month and have never been disappointed. I'm a vegetarian, and they have a lunch special just for me! Mixed vegetables with tofu (I usually get it sans the tofu), with brown rice and a cup of egg drop soup for under $9. There's 4 or 5 other lunch specials, including the pad thai, which still comes with a side of rice with and a soup/salad. Seems like a carb overload, but if that's what you're into then go for it! 

Add a thai iced tea with coconut milk and you're good to go (caffeinated as hell but so good). Be sure to come in before noon, or you'll be waiting for a table. Or do as I do and order pick up."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best Thai food I have had since moving from the east coast.  Off the beaten path, so a little hard to find but great atmosphere quick service with a smile."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Ordered with spice level 5 but received a sugary lunch. Miles away from authentic Thai food. Avoid at any cost"}
{"text":"The food is okay.  Service is horrible.  I have given them three chances and all I can say is rude rude rude!  The last straw was when they delivered part of my order wrong and yelled at me for it.  The food isn't that good for me to overlook the service.

Don't do it!!!!

For the best Thai food......nothing beats Archie's Bistro"}
{"text":"If it wasn't for Thai House, I would not get to eat Thai food frequently. There's only one real Thai place near where I live, but luckily i work right by this one. The Scottsdale Airpark area is lucky to have such a great restaurant tucked away in this shopping center.

I've only ever had lunch here, but I've ordered a bunch of different stuff (I once got a giant bowl of tom ga soup and ate the whole thing myself)! What's awesome is that a lot of their specialty dishes have a spot on their lunch menu. I thoroughly recommend the chicken panag, the basil chicken, the pad thai, the broccoli beef (seriously) and perhaps my favorite though not most ordered, the chicken special. It's half a chicken that's been simmered in Thai spices and served with a helping of rice. The only reason I don't order it every time is that it's a LOT of food. All the lunch combos have generously-sized and come with your choice of soup (usually egg drop, but some days it's imitation crab) or a small salad, and some rice. When ordering a spicy dish, they'll ask you \"1 to 5?\" as a scale for how much heat you want, but if you aren't timid you may want to ask for a \"10\" or \"12\" like Nader A. You also have the option to switch out your meat for tofu ($1) or have brown rice instead of white (also $1). 

Thai House is DELICIOUS. I have never been let down by this restaurant, and it's always on my list for a lunchtime destination. It's one of those places you could go to multiple times a week and not ever get bored of."}
{"text":"Wonderful thai food all around, the Panang chicken is insane!
Also try the Kung poi but substitute the carrots for green beans ( a tip from a friend) it's awesome.
This is a family run place and the food reflects this in all the good ways.
Love this place"}
{"text":"The best Thai food!!! Thai house on shea....its chicken panang with extra basil. Also the chicken satay extra peanut sauce is amazing! thats all we have had before! Not open till 4 on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit Thai House for awhile and I'm so glad I finally did. I ordered my usual Thai order: Shrimp Pad Thai. They have the traditional 1-5 \"hotness\" rating, like other places. Usually, I go all out when I visit a Thai place for the first time, but today I was feeling like a wimp and went with a 4. It was quite good, and had some decent amount of heat. Only complaint is the use of tail on shrimp. I hate having to remove them myself before I eat them. I wish all places would just remove those suckers before cooking. But that's really all. Service was excellent and it was decently priced, maybe slightly high but it was still a good value. I'll have to return again to try out the 5!"}
{"text":"A group of us went to Thai House for lunch on Sunday, and really enjoyed it. The restaurant was small, and quiet which is ok with me. Typically, when I go to a new Thai place I always order the same thing, Shrimp Pad Thai, extra spicy. Thai House gives you an option for how spicy you'd like your meal, which is pretty standard for Thai places. They give you an option of 0-5 for spiciness (Translation: Wimp - I was born in Thailand!). It was also reasonably priced, with most choices somewhere between $8 - $11. 

I ordered the Pad Thai at a 4 spiciness this time, mainly because you never really know what constitutes a 5 until you've eaten there at least once. The food was tasty and had a decent amount of spice to it. I can usually handle pretty spicy food, and this was slightly less spicy then I was expecting. Next time I visit their, I'll go all in with the 5. Wish me luck! The only thing I didn't like is that they leave the tails on the shrimp. This seems to be a standard practice at most places so I'm guessing their is a reason for it, maybe someone can explain it to me? I just hate have to pick the tails off before eating, or removing them as I'm chewing. 

Overall, it was a very nice dining experience. Good food and a great variety for others who don't like food as spicy as I do. My friend is on the wimp scale and they really enjoyed their meal, so don't be afraid to try it if you're a wimp too!"}
{"text":"I had been in the Sonoran Village mall dozens of times and never noticed this nondescript Thai restaurant.  A friend had recommended it and I had to call the restaurant to find it, it is next to Chase Bank and Best Buy is a few hundred yards away.  A solid menu, steady service, and ample portions.  I had a hankering for a curry dish and ordered the Pineapple curry with a spice level of 2.  It was excellent, although I would go with a spice level of 3 the next time.  My friend had the Kung Pao with a spice level of 3 and it kicked.  The food was delicious and I had at least a meal and a half as leftovers, all for under $15 per person.  FYI, they do not have a liquor license so if you were interested in Thai beer, you'll be out of luck.  Good to know this place is close by so when I have a hankering for Thai, I have somewhere to go.  YUM!"}
{"text":"Thai House excelled - again. Two months ago I placed a take-out order of the spicy noodles w/ chicken, spice level 2. It came out being a 6 or 7 - inedible. Called to complain and was promised they would make it right next time.
Came back a few days ago and mentioned the incident. The guy behind the counter went through some notes, found my name and offered me another spicy noodles on the house. Bravo! And it was excellent; perfect spice-level and flavorful. 
Kudos, Thai House."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this place based on the reviews. 
We started with the spring rolls then ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp, kung pow chicken with white rice and a side of brown rice.  
Should have known when our plates were put down, the lady wiped something off with her finger quickly. 
The food was below average taste. 
We waited and waited for waters to be refilled. Finally I had to get up about 15 minutes later and ask for our brown rice and refills. 
Not once were we checked on after our food was brought out. 
Don't order the chicken, it's close to leather quality. 
To make it an even better atmosphere they started to mop the floors around us. Nothing like ammonia smell while you eat. 
The entire time we were waiting all 5 staff members were eating and on their phones. 
Yelp should give the option of a zero star rating. This review would qualify for a zero."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at Thai House. We ordered their fresh spring rolls, their house salad and mango sticky rice. All of I was delicious. Very friendly and attentive staff. Highly recommend this restaurant. The only negative is that it isn't located in Puyallup, WA where we live. ;-)"}
{"text":"Favorite Thai restaurant in town! I particularly like the red curry dish and mango sticky rice for dessert"}
{"text":"This was a travesty in every way. HORRIBLE service AND food. The chicken teriyaki was totally bland and watery. Chicken was chewy and lacked any quality. The beef special lacked ANY flavor. Brown rice is an extra charge and is terrible. Worst experience ever!"}
{"text":"Thai House
My new iPhone is becoming a great tool for finding new places to eat. The combination of being location aware with GPS and the Yelp Application mean that I can find places to eat nearby very quickly. Last night this happened when I was leaving work and needed to get a bite to eat before heading home. So I brought up Yelp and hit Restaurants and Filtered them down to within 1 mile of my current location, having a maximum of $$ for price, and being open(a critical factor often overlooked with most online restaurant finders). the result was an Ice Cream Shop and Thai House. Being 31 I opted for Thai over Treat.

Thai House is located in the Sonora Village shopping center just south of Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and west of the 101. Its near Rays Pizza and just north of Best Buy. The setting is straight forward diner style with tables and three booths. One nice touch is the mirrored walls on each side of the dining room making it seem three times larger and lightening everything up.

I ordered the Rad Nah and some hot Green Tea. I was served in less than 5 minutes to a steaming bowl of Tofu, Broccoli, and Noodles in a delicious broth. I had asked for Medium spice and that was good but still burned my throat a bit. the dish was delicious but a bit warm. I suggest letting it sit for a few minutes, or eat with someone else and share your dishes. This will help to cool the items and give you the opportunity to connect.

Overall I recommend the Thai House for a nice quick meal. They are Vegetarian Friendly and will substitute Tofu for any of the meats."}
{"text":"Service is a little slow but very warming and helpful. I enjoyed the food. The owners have a gold mine. This place is amazing.  The waitress I had was amazing. I wish I knew her name. They just earned a regular customer. Thank you for amazing experience my first time eating there."}
{"text":"What's with the hater's?!

Shake it off Thai House - your food is bomb.com

We had ordered delivery, we got the yellow curry, spicy beef salad, spring rolls, & the coconut milk soup. All of it was exceptional- we had ordered everything with a spice level of 4, we'll bump it down to a 3 next time. The Thai ain't joking with their spices.

I seriously suggest anyone looking for Thai food give this place a try, we thought it was yummmmy and delivery was speedy!"}
{"text":"Wow! The Penang Curry (chicken) was absolutely incredible!! The portion was huge...had enough left over for another meal and tasted just as good the 2nd day. I will definitely be back! The Thai Tea was very good also. I just wish it was closer to Gilbert!"}
{"text":"If there were 6 stars, I would give them 3 because the food was very good quality, generously portioned and reasonably priced, but the service needs a LOT of work and that is NOT \"A-OK.\" I asked for red curry with pork and shrimp. The waiter said they have a combination that already has shrimp as well as chicken and beef, so I ordered it. Not even one shrimp, but I didn't discover that until I was half-finished eating and needed to get back to the office. When I told the waiter, he said the chef told him he put shrimp in it. Then he scurried away and started cleaning other tables like we weren't even having a conversation! I asked another, seemingly older, waiter if the manager was in and he said she wasn't there. Poor communication and no customer service orientation. I didn't expect a refund, but a classy response would have been to offer a complimentary dessert or a discount coupon for next time. Not that I cared, but this was the LOUDEST Thai restaurant I've ever seen, with high school boys eating lunch there and yelling like they were in a school cafeteria! Isn't it sad when restaurant managers think ANYBODY can be a waiter and fail to train them in how to deal with problems?"}
{"text":"This place serves really great Thai food at reasonable prices.
Staff are friendly and nice.  Restaurant is unpretentious and comfortable.
I try to go here at least once a week, and often get take out.
Recommended  to friends and all they become regulars too."}
{"text":"Tuesday 7:30p Live Music!  Excellent delivery service also.  

I am picky so exactly what I order to me is the best way lol, the Thai House Fried Rice, no crab, onion, tomatoes, raisins.  Then, you get extra pineapple, chicken & shrimp which is freshly cooked.

It takes me about 2 minutes to eat the crab wontons & egg rolls they are so perfectly made. I'd like to try another app soon, but have been in love w/ these for awhile.  Also the lunch time special is a great deal.  Soup, egg rolls & your entree.

The menus are quite old so that'd be my only complaint, but the deliciousness overrides that, along w/ the service & smiling happy people."}
{"text":"I think this location is the best by far. The pad thai and yellow curry are out of this world. I also tried the wonton soup which was full of veggies like carrots and broccoli as well as wontons and was hands down the best wonton soup I've had in years! Chicken satay was yummy and the thai fried rice spectacular. Great place to call in an order and pick up and bring home home to enjoy. If you're looking for great thai food, this place is it!"}
{"text":"While visiting friends in Scottsdale (from Seattle, where we are spoiled with good Thai food) we got a craving and our friends suggested Thai House. Everything was so good! I had the lunch special with panang curry. Could have been a little spicier (though I did only order 2 star) but otherwise it was perfect. Will be sure to come back here on my next trip to Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, super portions, fresh and good prices!  
Super spicy panang curry with brown rice is by far my favorite! Thai House is quickly becoming my favorite."}
{"text":"Was craving thai fried rice for lunch on Sunday so stopped by Thai House.  I'm a regular here and realized that I've never reviewed it.  This is my go-to spot for Thai food in the north valley.  It is consistent, great flavors, fast service, and it's clean and spacious.  If you are there, I'd recommend you try the Penang Curry, their Pad Thai, and their Spicy chicken noddle dish.

Great food, big portions, fast service, and great value!"}
{"text":"Forgot my rice and got spice on curry wrong. We were frequent customers but since they did not make it right we will be going elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of Thai restaurants in the Valley and this place is my least favorite. 

The taste of their Coconut curry is a bit off compare to their competitors, their fresh spring roll has a lot of lettuce and less shrimps, the Pad Thai was oily (not sure what kind of oil that was in there).

The service was not the best, we waited for our order for almost 45 minutes."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, each time hoping my order will be done correctly and I'm always disappointed. I order a green curry with tofu, it's not a difficult order, and in some variation has been wrong every time. I would suggest going somewhere else if you're like me and expect your orders to be just that- how you ordered them."}
{"text":"Best Tom Ka Gai soup I have ever had! The husband agreed. It was really rich with coconut milk and a bit sweeter than usual but had all the lemongrass and spice flavor that we know and love. We also had the pad thai and yellow curry which are our thai food staples. We started with a small plate of egg rolls and I topped off my meal with a thai iced tea. All that you need to know is that we finished EVERY LAST BITE. Yup, it's true. We normally take half home for later but we devoured our food so that was just not a possibility. 

The place is small and quaint and it was fairly busy on a Friday night which we took as a good sign. We are happy with Thai House and will be back!"}
{"text":"Their Pa-nang is amazing!!! A must try! While I don't know if Pa-nang is a common or traditional curry, it's the first kind I have ever tried. Shocking I know since I love Thai food. I definitely need to branch out and try a red or yellow or any other color. However, I order their Pa-nang lunch special at least 2/month. Their spicy scale is 1-5. I've been ordering a 4 and for me, it's nothing to cry over but it's a great combination of creamy coconut and spice. I always ask to add their \"mixed vegetables\" and there's always a generous amount. For a lunch meal under $10 it's more then enough for me. Their staff are always very nice & service has always been pretty fast."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. You'd never expect this little store front that blends in with the rest of the strip mall would produce the flavors of a high end restaurant. I travel an hour for their great noodles and amazing Ginger drink. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Good food, good wines, no frills. Pad Thai is reliable but I find the place slightly overpriced..."}
{"text":"We've been living in AZ for 7 months now and we are still looking for our go to Chinese/Thai/Asian restaurant that is consistent, tasty and reasonably priced. I was looking forward to eating here as the reviews were so great.

I ate lunch here today and found the place just to be ok. 

The restaurant had a nice lunch crowd at 2 PM and we were seated in a booth right away. The waitress gave us our menus and steered us towards the lunch menu. We were not going to order anything too hot or too exotic as it was the first visit so we decided on the Thai Iced Tea, Chicken Pad Thai and the Chicken Teriyaki. Both meals came with a side of fried rice and a garden salad.

The garden salad came out pretty quickly and it came with a sesame dressing. It wasn't a hearty salad with a lot of fixings, just a basic salad with dressing, wilty lettuce and a thinly sliced tomato. It was what it was, nothing to rave about.

Within 10 minutes both lunch specials came out and like the previous reviewers noted, the portions were huge. Especially for lunch.

The food came out at spice level 3 and the temperature of the food was lukewarm. The first few bites of the food, noodles and chicken had some warmth but as you dug through the Pad Thai and the chicken teriyaki it just got colder.

Not a pleasant experience as any cold food especially cold chicken just gives me the yuk factor. What was really strange was that both orders of the fried rice was hot.

As far as the chicken teriyaki, my hubby and I thought it was strangely cooked as the teriyaki sauce looked like it was just spread on top of it. Like sitting on top of the slices of chicken. This is a dish I would not order again as the chicken, while the pieces were generous, looked awkward with this teriyaki coating and with the lack of temperature in the chicken it made the taste of the thick sauce odd. I'm not even going to go into the raw broccoli and carrot pieces that were tossed next to the dish. The whole dish just didn't work.

The pad Thai had a nice flavor and very generous amounts of chicken, if only the dish came hot. The only thing missing from the Pad Thai were a a few slices of lime. I asked the waitress for some and she brought me a small slice of a lemon instead. That def wasn't what I wanted. As far as a Thai iced tea to wash down the meal, the waitress forgot to bring it so I never got to taste it. 

The place is clean and food generous so maybe it's worth exploring another visit."}
{"text":"We ordered  over the phone and were told 25-30 minutes.  My wife arrived and observed other people orders being served before ours, even though they were placed after ours. Order was placed at 713pm over the phone and she was able to leave the restaurant at 815; with the order we placed. When she got home, we we discovered the order was completely wrong even though it was read back to us on the phone. And the wontons were given to us even though they were completely
Burned. Never again."}
{"text":"I live closer to the other location but prefer to drive out of my way to this one. Food is always good. Spicy is Thai spicy which is great to see in the valley where so many places are not.

Service can improve a bit. Last time we went my husband's meal came out 10 minutes before mine. It was awkward."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch specials. With the Pad Thai they also give you rice. Carbs overload! Good service when they finally see you."}
{"text":"I became a routine customer here and the taste became routine to me .However they have better curry options than any other Thai places and they do good job on keeping their taste of the red curry(personally for me). 

This have a better seating than the one on N pima road and the staff I would suggest to be more polite and prompt to keep up their customers. Overall my experience with them is moderate and I would recommend this place if you really want to satisfy your thai cravings."}
{"text":"Well.. I am a fan of the one on shea/mountain view. We thought to try this place for a change and we entered during lunch time on Friday and we were asked to wait for 30 min. There is a huge rush and lot of noise around. As usual we ordered few items on the lunch menu hoping that they will be quickly served rather than the main menu items. And yes, we were served fast but the taste is not to the mark .

I don't know if the time we went matter or the one on the pima rd is different that the shea. Overall , I have an experience neither good nor bad."}
{"text":"Update: lowered the rating from 4 to 3 - they haven't been consistently good

This is the first decent Thai place we've had since moving to Scottsdale last June. We've been having a hard time finding decent Asian food in Scottsdale so I'm happy this place isn't too far from our house. We ordered take out and they were very prompt and friendly. We ordered their spring rolls (3.5 stars-note: they do not have fried rolls), larb gai (4 stars), spicy noodles (aka, pad khee mao-3.5 stars) and their garlic beef (4 stars). Their prices were very reasonable. We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"A 3 at best. Mediocre Pad Thai, and the rest of the fare was pretty similar. Came because of the good rating but, alas, the rating was wrong."}
{"text":"Solid thai place.

I got the panang curry and loved it. Was a lot of food though, so would recommend eating family style if you come here with people. If not, also good to just take home for leftovers. The panang curry had peppers, and even though I'm not the biggest fan of peppers, eating them in this curry was pretty good! My friends had the green curry and the pad see ew. These were also great options and would also recommend."}
{"text":"Go to Thai restaurant when I don't feel like driving to Chinatown. Prices are a bit higher, but the service is great (although I can't say if that's just because they know we are frequent customers). 
Like how the large soups are served in the hot pot with sterno so it doesn't get lukewarm. Lots of veggies & flavor. 
Can't comment on their meat dishes but they can make some great vegan Thai food - pad Thai, Pad Kee Mow, & the curries (red, green & panang) are my faves. 
I also appreciate that takeout doesn't come in styrofoam cups - I hate those.
There is a stage, but I've never seen any entertainment. It is large enough to accommodate a large group, unlike some of my fave hole-in-the wall places."}
{"text":"So this use to be one of my favorite Thai places when I moved to Veritas apartments. Lunch is still my opinion best value for the money. You get a soup, vegetable egg roll and then your main entree and rice for just one price. Now recently when I was getting ready to move we order take out and I order the pannag curry with fried tofu and for my gf order the a vegetable chow main since she is vegan and vegetarian. I was starving so just jumped into eating my food, come to find out my vegetarian curry was a chicken curry which i didn't mind too much but when my girl went to try it, that wasn't good. Not to mention usually my curry has some mixed vegetable and had none! All it was, was sauce and chicken not good at all. All in all besides the bad experience not a bad Thai food."}
{"text":"Love love love Thai House.

My 8-year old daughter begs to eat here often, which speaks volumes since she is THE pickiest eater I know. Her favorite is the Pad See Ew (chicken with wide flat noodles and veggies). Very flavorful. I like spice, so when I order mine I get a \"5\", which is supposed to be the spiciest on their scale from 1-5, but it usually not spicy enough. That's fine though, I just tell them to make it extra spicy and then I am happy while I am coughing and tearing and gasping for air and water. 

The service is extremely fast and friendly. This place is always packed during lunch hours, especially during the work week. They are closed on Sundays (boo hoo). Their pricing is decent, especially the lunch specials, which come with your choice of white or fried rice, and a soup or salad. Everytime I have come to the Thai House I have loved it, and have gotten my meal within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"They keep getting bigger, and service keeps getting slower. Enough for me to drop the rating.

Food is pretty good and the prices are fair. Last time I was here for lunch it took 2 hours. One of our guys came 30 minutes after we ordered food and was still served before most of our original order. It is a shame, I used to like coming here... but with service this slow on lunch hour I can't."}
{"text":"this place doesn't mess around with their spice!  i order 20-25 \"stars\" (don't do this unless you're prepared to get your ass kicked) and i've gotta tell you, they're not afraid to burn you a little!  i mean this as an incredible compliment!  most thai restaurants wont make food nearly hot enough for me. LOVE the red curry and tum yum/ka vegetable soups."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as it used to be.....disappointing pad thai n duck salad.....too bad...."}
{"text":"Flavors are almost spot on.  Place isn't quite \"Thai\" as the folks are from all over South East Asia, and you can tell the food isn't quite Thai with the way they do certain things( menu as a lot of Chinese influence, serving rice with noodles, condiments are not typically or pre added).  Had the Pad Thai with Chicken lunch special and Pad Thai with Tofu lunch special. Egg Drop soup was ok, as was salad, nothing special.  Both Pad Thai had a little too much chili oil in there and sprouts were already pre mixed (cooked).  The flavors was good,, 75% of what the Pad Thai flavor should be.  Lunch was cheap and place is a solid 3.5 stars.  Minus half star for charging extra for Tofu substitute instead of chicken."}
{"text":"YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS!!!! Absolutely AMAZING Thai food! I traveled Thailand for 3 months & this is the real thing! I order curry from here at least once a week whether takeout or dining in. Staff are friendly for the most part. Well priced items, especially at lunch time. Service is fine, but the food is fabulous. I've tried almost everything on the menu. My favorites: red & green chicken or beef curry, spring rolls & the pad see ew. Skip the papaya salad. DEFINITELY give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Thai place. Whether it's dine in or taking it to go, I'm never disappointed.

With Thai food, you have to be cautious of the level of spiciness but here they make sure to ask you how spicy you want something. There have been times I've ordered the Spicy Chicken Fried Rice at a level 8 and sometimes it's so spicy and other times it's not spicy enough. It definitely depends on the cook, so I'd suggest just picking a number you usually like to go with on a scale from 1 to 10 on spiciness (1 being not spicy and 10 being the hottest).

It's clean and the water they gave doesn't have that taint of sink water, so if you're thinking of dining in, it's definitely a great option!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I would give this place a four. The pricing is great for the food you get. What I have noticed is that when you ask for spicy level 1-5 on some days it's really spicy and sometimes it's hardly spicy at all. So it is usually a hit or miss. Yesterday I ordered a spice level of 4 and it may as well have been a 1. The food was still good, just not as great as it would of been, if it was hotter. The staff is nice. It's usually always busy in the evening. Great for take out! I ordered again from here a few days ago and the food was exceptional. If you're ordering for multiple people I would recommend asking them to label the boxes since they don't do that already. Food ordered using take out is rather quick."}
{"text":"I hate it when I have to take back an excellent review.  
Ordered the fried chicken dumplings as an appetizer which were good.  
Had the pork with ginger.  I love ginger.  But why did the chef slice the pork so thinly that it overcooked to the point of it being like sawdust.  The flavor of the sauce was not bad, but the overcooked meat ruined it.  I left over half of it.  No sense bringing it home.  
The second dish, orange chicken, was customized to omit the breadcrumbs.  They did a good job with the customization but this dish suffered from the same defect as the pork dish.  The chicken was overcooked.  
The service was attentive and friendly but there is little that can overcome thin slices of overcooked meat."}
{"text":"I order from this place all the time. The food is amazing and the order is always accurate and complete."}
{"text":"I got take-out from here on a business trip to Scottsdale, and it was OK.  Cute, clean place, pleasant service.  

I got a green chicken curry and it was nothing special... not much flavor.  Not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in town. Our 4 favorite items are the pork pad se ew, combination fried rice, chicken yellow curry, and the crab ragoons. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great food ,great service and they do delivery.I am Originally from Thailand.This restaurant makes me the food that reminds me of my grandma's cooking. I would say Thai House restaurant is one of my favourite Thai place. Apart from The regular menu their special dishes will also satisfy your palate."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Red chicken curry, orange chicken, and chow mein are some favorites. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Pass on this one I ordered one of the coconut soups very bland chicken poor quality no pizzazz not worth the money or the trip over there"}
{"text":"This place is nothing but a hole in the wall,  but let me tell you... It's amazing. Soups are great and the 35 chicken curry is the"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place almost by accident and I am very glad we did. Their rangoon's are the best i have ever had and their spicy rice was very good too. Service was great! I feel this place is much better than the more popular lotus of siam or pin kaow"}
{"text":"Went in here on the boyfriend's recommendation. 
Going in here, I was intrigued and surprised by the layout and decor of the restaurant. The hostess counter wasn't being used, but it wasn't busy, and the cashwrap area was in the back near the kitchen. Guess it doesn't matter though because the waitress/hostesses bring your check to their patrons and all. 
Our hostess turned out to also be our waitress, and she was super nice. She didn't do much to chat with us, but she'd check up on us several times during the meal. I'd like to describe her personality as genuinely bubbly. 
I think the manager also came to talk to us a bit - she was also greeting and seating groups as the dinner hour progressed. She was also nice and courteous.
This Thai restaurant isn't like any other that I've been to. For instance, you have to ask them to make your Thai dishes spicy. 
I had the Beef Pad Thai and Lychee Boba, the boyfriend had the Chicken Pad See Ew, and we had steamed pot stickers for an appetizer. The pot sticker plate was still wet from the steam, but it came with a good sauce for extra flavoring. The Pad Thai was yummy. Didn't expect it to be as sweet as it was without adding spice, and I liked the beef 'cause it was marinated well before being cooked. The Boba was really good! It really did taste like Lychee, so I'm definitely happy it wasn't like some kind of powdered flavor. The Pad See Ew was also different without adding spice to it, but I didn't like it as much, so... Our next visit here, I'll be sure to ask them to give it an extra kick (if the boyfriend doesn't beat me to it). It was still cooked well though."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The waitress was very indifferent and could care less about serving us though they were not very busy. Had to flag her down to order. The food did come quickly, but then I had to flag her down to for the check, and then finally to pay. Craziness!

The food was so-so. The coconut milk soup was too strong, and the spicy basil leaf wasn't very good either. The Pa-nang was good."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Thai house for years Al an Pon are great people treat you like family an the food is best around"}
{"text":"Awesome! I'm here for business and planned on trying someplace new every day...I had Thai House for lunch and I'm tempted to go back for dinner.

Shrimp & chicken pad Thai, level 3 spiciness add pineapples! Service was quick. Food flavor robust."}
{"text":"This place is great whether for take out or eat in. Their spicy catfish is delightful and eggplant dishes to die for. The duck Salad was warm and delicious. I recommend this restaurant wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"I'm not one to write a low star review but we were extremely disappointed in our meals. We ordered the Pad See Ew (level 2) and Spicy Noodles (level 3) and both were so bland that we ending up asking for extra spice to add and used the sauce provided at the table in addition to salt. Nothing seemed to help give our dishes flavor even though we piled seasoning on. My fiancé said it seemed like all the flavor was boiled out of our food. I tried eating individual items from my plate, an onion, a red pepper, a piece of chicken...all tasteless. To be fair, we were told to come and get the Pad Thai and reviews suggest the yellow curry. We've been eating Thai food for years, even visited Thailand and have never had noodle dishes so poorly seasoned."}
{"text":"Really really good Thai food. Staff are really sweet and are always smiling. Would definitely recommend. Had so much food had to pack to go and finish."}
{"text":"Now my go-to place in the land of stripmalls.

Be careful, they bring the spicy if you ask for it."}
{"text":"The food here is decent, but I won't return after how my boyfriend and I have repeatedly been treated. 

Everytime we visit the restaurant, it's the same thing. We end up waiting forever to have our orders taken, and the waitresses are rude and never check up on our table. Having a partner who worked in some of the finest restaurants on the strip sit down to a meal with me, and be treated as such, is absolutely apalling. 

The last straw, was when I ordered a dish, and the taste was fishy and rancid, and the noodles were over-cooked. When I asked for the manager, the girls were extremely rude and combative, until finally, we had the manager come to our table. After politely explaining that the dish simply did not taste edible, the manager was defensive and condescending, and told me that the dish is \"supposed to taste like that.\" The dish was supposed to taste like garbage? He refused to take it off our bill or even swap it out for something else. We paid and left promptly, and never returned. I was shocked. Never have I experienced someone so incredibly rude to me in a dining experience!

The lack of customer service greatly over shadows the food. After our third visit with horrible service, we will never be back again.

If you want UNBELIEVABLY bad service with management and servers who do not know what they are doing, then by all means, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is excellent!  The quality of their ingredients is first rate. You can order dishes on a 1-5 scale of heat, which should please everyone. The restaurant decor is beautiful, and the staff efficient and friendly. Their prices are also very good,and, they offer brown rice, which is most appreciated...we have eaten many times and never be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great prices, great food, very healthy, easy to get hooked on!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 4 1/2 stars, but only for atmosphere. The food quality and service definitely get 5 stars. Personally I love spicy Thai food any chance I get. But the quality for the price is outstanding. The spicy noodle also known as drunken noodle with chicken is unbelievably delicious. We've had the Penang and the green curry so far, both Currys were unbelievably tasty. We also enjoyed the garlic pepper chicken with cilantro. Super good super garlicky!!! Like I said the atmosphere is nothing super special, but for the price and the quality of the food I cannot complain. I am writing this review after a second visit, and we will be back many many more times for sure to this convenient location."}
{"text":"place is amazing! best pad thai ever! It also fairly inexpensive especially for lunch :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten a lot of Thai food in my life, but this is one of the best! 

I have only done \"take-out\" orders, so I can not tell you about the staff, waiters, or service provided. Except they are helpful when placing a order.

I must say the Yelp menu on the site has not been updated. So you will just have to sort that out when you're at the restaurant or place the pick-up order.

The Spring Rolls were great! The Green Curry was to die for and like most dishes, it has a little something special in it that brings out a wonderful taste in each bite you take. I can not explain it, but you just don't want to stop eating it. I have always ordered \"two star\" and found it to be not too hot, but flavorable. The Pad-thai is excellent and you may want to try the beef version, if you have not had it in the past."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate there Saturday April 29 for lunch. Service was excellent.  Food (pad thai) was just OK.  I asked for medium hot/spicy, but it tasted more sweet than spicy, and if I want spicy, I just want spicy with no sweet flavor added.  I still prefer pad thai at Ling & Louies.  Probably will not go back."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky about Thai food and we love this place. Food is great, everyone here is very nice, and the restaurant is clean. A++"}
{"text":"This place is always rock solid.  I tried something new today, Pineapple Curry, heat level 5.  Very good, but I will do it with chicken instead of shrimp next time.  There are better Thai places in the valley, but this place is consistently great and close to home."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots for a quick lunch. I love their $4.95 tom yum noodle soup with ground chicken and fish balls. The portion is just right where you don't over do it. They also have a great lad na dish and be prepared for the giant portion. The Thai ice tea and coffee is also a generous size. The people there are the kindest you will meet. Stop by and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Please eat here if you love Thai food as much as I do! I've never been disappointed! The beef pad thai is some of the best I've ever tasted. The tom ka gai, rad nar, garlic chicken, and pretty much everything else I've ever ordered here is great. I try to get one new thing each time I go.

This is also the first place I tried Thai coffee. Excellent! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"4.75/5
Try any curry... The Pad Thai (if you're new to Thai), chili mint duck, pad see ew, rad na, laarb... What a flavor profile, spiced just right 
Kind service, generous portions
This is the new Thai benchmark.
Having tried too many Thai spots in Vegas... This is THE SPOT
Give it a try, you'll come back... Repeatedly

4.75 only because sometimes it takes a while to pay... Minor infraction especially for this level of quality food"}
{"text":"I give restaurant 4 and half star!
Most dishes are delicious, restaurant is clean n well kept, owner and staff are friendly.
They even have karaoke!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pad see noodles and they were awful. Along with the mediocre egg rolls. This is probably the worst Thai food I've ever had. Do not waste your money."}
{"text":"When trying a new Thai place I always get the same thing, spicy Thai basil fried rice. Because if that isn't good I'm not likely to return because it is one of my favorites! And it was EXCELLENT@ Thai house. I can't wait to go back and try other dishes
 I also hardly ever get dessert at Thai restaurants because my dessert philosophy is that chocolate should be involved but my friend ordered the mango and sticky rice dessert and I devoured my half! I will be there again soon!!"}

Staff are friendly and nice.  Restaurant is unpretentious and comfortable.
I try to go here at least once a week, and often get take out.
Recommended  to friends and all they become regulars too.
Love it."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on Maryland and Silverado Ranch. I took my sister for lunch here since we were in the vicinity. The interior is well decorated and cute. The cleanliness did not seem to be an issue. The service was great. We did the lunch special which for $6.95 ea included soup of the day (egg drop- large bowl but fairly bland, needed a large amount of chili paste and sriracha), and suppose to be dumplings and spring rolls. They were out of dumplings and just doubled up on spring rolls which was fine. I had the red curry with chicken and steamed rice and sis had pad thai with beef. My curry was adequate... it was not even close to best curry I have had by a long shot..but definitely worth the lunch price. Sister's pad thai seemed a bit greasy, but definitely not bad for the price we were paying.  I have been to Thai House while I lived on Silverado Ranch and every dish I had was above average to great. Worth checking out at least once."}
{"text":"The food here is really good and fairly reasonable.  We tried the spring rolls, egg rolls, pad thai, and green curry.  They were all really good.  My favorite was the egg rolls, and green curry.  You can choose what kind of meat you want in the curry and pad thai.  I tried the shrimp and chicken.  Only negative is that some of the shrimp were not deveined properly and some still had the tail on them, and some pieces of the chicken had tiny, sharp bones in them.  

I also tried the mango sticky rice dessert.  It was sooo good!"}
{"text":"Good food.  Service was nice too.  Everyone was really friendly.  The place was clean and organized.  They have a good menu of items.  There's a lot of variety from mild to spicy.  Love the curry!"}
{"text":"Had not had thai in decades. In town visiting daughter and we gave it a try. Had salmon panang special. It was very tasty and the portion was quite generous for the very reasonable price. I am no great connoisseur of Thai cuisine, but I enjoyed a nice meal at a nice price in a nice place with friendly service and would go back. They gave me nothing to complain about and that's saying a lot considering a lot of my recent restaurant experiences"}
{"text":"Nice simple thai resturant. I been to Thailand and lots of thai restaurants so I'm giving it a four stars base on the taste of food compare to previous experience. Friendly staff, lunch special was reasonable and came in large portions is a steal compare to other thai restaurants. The Pang Nang curry was good but the fried rice was super bland. The pad thai is mediocre . Thai tea extremely sweet not for my taste but overall experience it was nice."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here. Great Thai food! Lunch specials are great.  Mint chicken is amazing.  Restaurant is clean, service is good.  Probably the best Thai in LV!"}
{"text":"Perfect Thai food at a reasonable price. This is the take out you are looking for.  Eating in isn't a great environment, but just focus on the take out experience."}
{"text":"I have been very pleased with this restaurant. Great location, ambience inside, and the food taste wonderful. More specifically,they give you a good deal for the price you pay, large portions. My pet peeve is when other restaurants nickel and dime you, give you small portions for what you pay.  This restaurant does not do that. Again, I'm very impressed with this restaurant, and look forward to going again soon!

Keep doing what you're doing !!!"}
{"text":"Really good food, cleaner ten before after their recent remodeling and expand their place .
We are in love of their eggplant plate 
Price are really reasonable and good great potion that you can share with some family member 
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch when in the area.   

The staff was friendly and were quickly seated and served.  Service continued to be excellent throughout our visit.

We had the Pineapple and shrimp curry and Pad Kee Mao.

The curry was wonderful.  Certainly on par with the best Thai food i have eaten elsewhere.

The Pad Kee Mao (Spicy noodles) was wonderfully spicy without losing flavor.  

For dessert we had the fried bananas which were simply amazing.

All in all I would recommend the Thai House to friends. We will visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"I got the vegetable soup which was very fresh and flavorful without being overlooked. My husband got the sweet and sour chicken which was awesome. It had a lot of fresh veggies which made the proportion slightly off but the flavors were great. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We come here for the Tom Gha Kai, especially on Friday evenings when they have Elvis singing. He's very low key and not at all in your face trying to show off--just singing away with the volume not too high. It's fun to take out of town guests here for this reason. Their chicken coconut soup is better than Lotus of Siam's---like night and day. But the opposite is true for the satay. Most of the time there are just two of us and we're satisfied with just the soup, and still have some to take home. I've tried a few other things, but it's all about the soup."}
{"text":"Best Thai food! Always fresh and consistent. Food is always hot and made to order. Lunch specials are $6.95 and comes with choices of rices, soup or salad and many choices for the entrees. We always come back"}
{"text":"Their Panang curry is amazing. However, I feel their Pad Thai's flavor is off. Not sure what's wrong with it."}
{"text":"Yummy! Yummy! Yummy! Over 10 years ago I lived in Los Angeles. They have Thai restaurants almost everywhere and their food and prices were very competitive! I stumbled upon this place and for me, it's the closest thing to a Los Angeles thai restuarant. 

Everything I've ordered so far has been amazing! I have yet to be disappointed! 

The only reason why I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I personally am not a fan of the music entertainment. It's not bad, it's just that when you're dining with friends in that type of setting, I almost always feel I have to compete with the musician/singer. 

I usually have the pad thai and ask for the \"combination\". I could eat that whole thing by myself!!!"}
{"text":"1) Wasn't happy with the talk radio chatting away in the background. 2) They didn't have thai coffee. Other than that, good food & a lot of it. Shared pad thai w/a side of rice w/my wife; we were full afterwards."}
{"text":"Large portions but the food was pretty bland.  We had the pad thai and egg rolls--I suggest that you avoid both."}
{"text":"First time having lunch and it was great. However I discovered 2 unauthorized transactions on my card the next day. Unfortunately I suspect this business, this was my first time using my new paypal card, so I noticed immediately. Small purchases were made, thank goodness I noticed. Lesson learned, not to allow my card out of sight, even at a highly recommended restaurant, my fault."}
{"text":"A couple years back I went to Vegas with my cousin and we partied our butts off for 3days. Than when it was time to go back home we headed off the main strip aka the strip and went here. Goodness was I in for a treat some of the best and 'real' Thai I've had when I say real I mean it was spicy. Which I love, when I'm back in town I'll be returning here!"}
{"text":"when me and the hubby is in the mood for some Thai food this is the spot we always go to.  I was introduced to this place by a friend of mines who has been going here for many years.  I've never been disappointed with any of their dishes.  But honestly we always seem to get the same  things chicken pad Thai, fried chicken, green curry and fried rice which seems to be the staple Thai food. 
my parents were here for a short vacation and the also loved it! mind you it was there first time trying Thai food."}
{"text":"These guys have it down to an art: Delicious Thai cuisine, clean shop and courteous staff- all at a great price-so rare!  Ask for Josie. She's wonderful."}
{"text":"I love it here.  We moved to the area this past summer and found thai house a few months ago.  The food has always tasted fresh and delicious.  I have ordered the yellow curry three times (it is my favorite) and it always tastes wonderful.  I have to keep myself from licking the bowl.  Others in my party have ordered the kung pau, mongollian beef, sweet and sour chicken, the lemon chicken and Chicken fried rice.  Everyone loved their food.  I have gotten the same waitress, she is very sweet and really tries to make sure you are pleased.  She does everything to make sure my kids are happy, which means alot to me.  I realy like it here and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Our family felt like having some good Thai food like they have in Southern California. We ordered Chicken Wonton Vegetable soup, Spicy Beef, Curry Noodles, and Yellow Curry. 

The soup was excellent!
Yellow Curry was way too sweet.
The Curry Noodles were good.
Spicy Beef was extremely tough to chew, so we returned the dish. They offered to replace with something else, but when we learned that the meat consistency would be the same, so we declined the offer.

We asked for Sticky rice with Mangos instead, and she emphasized the price difference between the beef dish and the dessert, beef costing more, that we'd be charged for the beef for the dessert. 

We thought, if that's their policy, so be it. When she was delivering the dessert, she said they removed the charge for the beef and added the charge for the dessert. She was nice about it, but we've had better food in Cali. We would have given two stars, but waitress was so nice that we decided for more."}
{"text":"True authentic Thai food.... when you say \"level 10 spicy\" they really make it level 10 unlike a lot of other places."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the FOOD from this restaurant... I love little else. When you order take out from this place prepare to wait at least 45 minutes and have the staff question you 5 times about whether you ordered from this location or the other. They look confused and shocked that you ordered from them yet they take your payment anyway. Then after sitting there for 15 minutes they apologize and bring you a water... maybe. Finally bringing your food out after you are about to explode from wasted time alone. I love the food but the service and their take out system really needs to change or they are gonna lose business fast."}
{"text":"Thai house is great!  Food is always prepared well and made fresh!  I frequently get take out.  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  They have great lunch specials too!"}
{"text":"Despite being housed in a mall, nice ambience, very good food, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"If you ever get stuck in the North Ridgeville or Elyria area and are craving Thai food this place is definitely passable.  It has better Thai food than some of the pretentious overpriced places I've been to on the Eastside that serve green linguini in their noodle dishes and pass it off as \"Thai.\"  I was on a date at the Thai House with a Chinese girl and the owner/waitress asked my date if she was Thai too!  My date was insulted and I had great laughs!  The Thai House is also close to Super Wal-Mart.  One of the greatest places for people watching in Ohio I've found so far."}
{"text":"I've been going to Thai House about once a month for the past year. I'm so glad I found this jewel. The food is consistently scrumptious and I haven't had anything I dislike.

I'm gluten free and the Green Curry with chicken or tofu is delicious. The Jasmine rice is to die for. It's fluffy, has a hint of sweetness to it and enhances the already delicious curry.

This Thai house is perfect for a date, family meal or a quick pickup. I like the atmosphere and the aroma of fresh, authentic Thai food that greets you in the restaurant. 

I'm a foodie and have visited a handful of Thai places around the valley and this place takes the win!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai here is the best I have had in the valley... Thai house always consistent and quality is great! A bit of a drive from my place so if anyone knows better I would like options. But don't mind continuing here :)"}
{"text":"Whenever I am craving pad Thai I have to come here.. Service is always a bit slow and today was no different - did a take out order and told 15 minutes. It was 30 and during that time another customer brought his incorrect takeout order back from
Home and was not happy at all. I felt for him and worried I might be upset, but got home and was once again happy with the food and worth the
 wait! Just can't get 5 stars with poor service :)"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai here is incredible. I had no spice on mine, but great white meat chicken was involved in this dish. Order the peanut sauce on the side, it is one of the better versions around town."}
{"text":"They have best lunch special in vegas!!
My Boyfriend and I go almost everyday
We love it!!"}
{"text":"The Panang Curry is the best curry I have ever had! The beef and broccoli is also incredible! I highly recommend this place! I always take friends here and they always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"lThe food is great at both locations. This was my first lunch special deal and the first course of three is pretty bad. You get a choice of egg drop soup (the worst item ever at any Chinese joint) or a salad if you can call it that. Small plate of bagged lettuce, watery ginger dressing. At least let us have hot and sour soup? Main course though was great as the chicken pad thai was perfect and egg fried rice was also a good choice. It came out to $7.50. Did have too move seats as three Scottsdale fake ass pigs thought it was Ok to spew curses every ten seconds while I was eating. I was glad to tell them to shut the hell up in my own special way."}
{"text":"I often get the yellow curry for takeout here! It's great food and I love the fried tofu in it. The people hardly speak English so it has always been a somewhat confusing experience when I pick up the food. Doesn't bother me too much, the food is still good"}
{"text":"Bland rice, bland noodles. Okay all around. But not the best. I have definitely had better in Phoenix area. Would probably not visit here again. But I tried it to say that I wasn't good."}
{"text":"Very good curry. Panama, yellow and mud-sa-mun is fantastic! Others food to try would be pad Thai and fried rice."}
{"text":"I order from here a few times a month. Super high quality food and BIG portions! Deliver is a little slower than other places, but soooo worth the wait!! Order online from their website and be prepared to FEAST!"}
{"text":"Love their Penang and their red curry!! It's the best. I usually add some extra vegetables. Great portions and always seems busy!   We have shared this place in food with many friends and everyone seems to love it."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here after going to another location with a friend. Definitely as good as expected! I am so happy that there is a Thai place near home that's so delicious. My boyfriend is not a fan of Thai food so if I'm not with a friend, it's takeout. I had the pad se ew with tofu and the chicken panang. This place is definitely my go to Thai joint from now on."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I've passed a thousand times and each time I'm like 'I want to try this place sometime'.  So serendipity smiles, I got my chance today.
I absolutely adore the Thai places back in Chicago, you eat like a king (or in my case eat Thai leftovers for a week :) for ~six bucks.  And they have a noodle I don't recall ever finding elsewhere-the chow fun type noodle very wide and with a slight hint of basil.....drool.....
So while Thai House did not have the pad se ewe noodles I am still on a mission to find closer than 1500 miles away, they did a pretty good job!  I thought it was a bit pricey at nine bucks for the lunch portion, but hey-it is Scottsdale dahling...No Thai iced coffee either which was weird.
They ask you how hot you want your dish on a scale of 1-5.  I chose three and really didn't detect any hint of spiciness, I'm always afraid to go five though LOL!!
So review is 3.5 stars rounded down for no coffee and the slight overpricey-ness."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years now. The atmosphere is great and the staff is very friendly. Sometimes when you order for delivery, believe it or not the owner is the driver. Super cool. 
I recommend the red or yellow curry, chicken satay and shrimp rolls. 
Cool fish tank with cichlids."}
{"text":"Don't go in and place a take out order during the weekday lunch rush. It took 40 minutes for them to get my order out although many other orders were filled as I waited. I started asking after 25 minutes and stood at the register after that. When it finally came out, it was not piping hot so I tend to think it was sitting back there somewhere. The place was a madhouse it was so busy. No apologies."}
{"text":"The worst pad see eww ever. Tofu was mushy, eggs were smash together, noodle were mushy, hardly any sauce. No one asked if I liked the food or if everything was ok when I barely ate the noodles. What a way to end my trip to Vegas..."}
{"text":"I told my son that he could pick where we ate today. He asked if there was a Thai restaurant around (we are new to Scottsdale). Luckily, Thai House was minutes from us and we decided to give it a try. I ordered the Basil Chicken lunch special. Soooo GOOD. Lots of basil, quality meat and a delicious sauce. 

The service was excellent. I was sat right away. Ordered quickly after and had lunch within 10 minutes of walking in the door. Friendly staff.

I love Thai food and I plan to become a regular."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!  Very good food and prices. Their lunch specials are the bomb.  Staff is very friendly and fun."}
{"text":"The owners of this restaraunt seem to really care. They actually read my review, explained they were changing cooks which caused my bad meal, and offered a complimentary meal for my next order.

Usually the delivery is super speedy quick. From the inital order placed, it took an hour and a half for my food to arrive, which i thought was strange and really annoying,

My curry was definitely better than last time. My only complaints are that the food lacks flavor and only really has spice/ heat to it. Same with my boyfriends pad thai. It was lacking meat as well.

I really really wanted to like this place,  but unfortunately, i really cant. Maybe its just because i always get delivery. Im not sure. But i was disappointed once again :(

Maybe you guya should bring back the cooks from two months ago when the food was to die for."}
{"text":"For a valley in the desert, Vegas has a wide selection of Thai restaurants.  And while I am sure that some insufferably overpriced place on the strip offers great Thai dishes, there are few restaurants offering better curry than Thai House Restaurant.

How can I best explain this?  Well, let's just say that even if I had a severe neurosis about germs and scrubbed with Purell every 30 minutes, I would still offer to lick the sauce in their Panang Curry (sweet peanut based curry) off the floor . . . yeah, seriously, Off. The. Floor.  It is that good.

Given my over-dramatic love of the Panang Curry, why only 4 stars?  Well, it's not the customer service (because the servers are very friendly).  It's some of the Chinese dishes they serve, which are just average.  Not bad, but not amazing.  They have also slightly screwed up a few of my orders.  They're pretty bad at following through on requests to add tofu or vegetables to dishes.  But if you don't want to tweak their Thai recipes with special requests, you will have a great dinner."}
{"text":"Thai House was off to a bit of a rough start with me when my delivery was a half hour late and my tummy was a grumbling, but other than that little forgivable mishap, I am glad I ordered from here. 

The Cashew Chicken was great! They didn't skimp on the cashews, like most places do and they weren't soggy either, like they often can be when ordering delivery. Their Cashew Chicken was colorful and consisted of baby corn, chunky bell peppers (both red and green) and onions, carrots & water chestnuts. I would definitely order the Cashew Chicken again. 

A side note: be careful with the spice when you order! I ordered \"extra spicy\" on this dish and it was hot as hell! I loved it but I don't think many could handle that level of spiciness. It was borderline too spicy for me and when it comes to spice tolerance, I'm certifiably insane! So I'd say their scales of hotness are on track with where they should be. You never know with some places. In some restaurants in order to get something extra spicy you have to order EXTRA extra spicy, so I thought it was worth taking a stab at deciphering this restaurant's spicy scale for all the other spice whores out there.

My only disappointment was with the Tom Kha soup because it was a little sweeter than I would have liked. It was still good though. I just probably wouldn't order it again.

I'd say that Thai House is deserving of a little higher than their current 3.5 star rating so I'm going to round up to 4 stars and give them that. I liked my dinner enough to keep them in mind when ordering Thai in the future."}
{"text":"i found this place on yelp just went there for dinner ordered chow mein and thai tea.thai tea is absolutely great.this is the best thai tea I had.but disappointed on chow mein... its different type of chow mein than other thai restaurant.its just a Little thin than lo mein.(the fat noodle)
food was good EXCept too saltY.  service was alright.will come back try pad thai sometime and definitely will get thai tea too go A lot since im just 5min away from them."}
{"text":"I suppose I should be clear and first fess up that this review is based on our delivery experience. We have yet to actually dine in the restaurant itself.

Super excited about the fact that they actually deliver - and for a very small, reasonable fee. And you can order online - major bonus in my world.

The food was delivered in just over 30 minutes. The packaging was great. No dripping or leaking. Plenty of chopsticks, silverware packets, sauces, and fortune cookies. And two free crunchy egg rolls!

The egg rolls were very delicious. Easily some of the best egg rolls I have ever had.

The two entrees we ordered were rather unadventurous, but were solidly delicious. The spicy garlic and pepper beef was pretty much just what you would expect. The sweet chili chicken was a big winner with us - excellent batter and extremely delicious sauce. 

And bonus points for getting the spicy levels just right. (There is a drop-down menu on the online ordering where you can choose how spicy you want each dish you order.)

Overall, a very solid delivery experience. One day, we may make it into the actual restaurant. (Perhaps for the karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights?)"}
{"text":"I've only had lunch here twice, but both times it was excellent.   The red curry is perfect.  The panang chili is also very good.  The prices are very reasonable and the staff is efficient for the most part.  The temperature has been a little chilly both times we were there and it is also slightly loud.   All in all, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Love the Tom Yum Koong, a seafood hot & sour soup!  We liked at a '3'"}
{"text":"This place was so good! The tom yum soup was one of the best tom yum soups that I've ever had and the drunken noodle dish was perfect too...just the right amount of spice in each dish! I loved this place and will definitely come back the next time that I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Visiting for a training and used Yelp to again locate a good restaurant. This is a Nice little eaterie in Scottsdale. They serve very large portions. I ordered the red curry chicken and a bowl of tom kha gai; both were really delicious and full of flavor. The service was friendly and very prompt. I'd love to return here on my next Scottsdale visit."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Thai spot!!! It's not fancy and the service is a little spotty but the food is hands down the Best!!! The red curry is my favorite but I have also had the panang, Tom kai gai and pad Thai.  Everyone I have taken here agrees that this is best Thai food in AZ"}
{"text":"I dont know if this place was having a bad day or what, but here's my first and will be only visit to this place.  Im in town for work and saw this place had good reviews so gave it a shot.  It took them at least 15-20 minutes to seat me and the place was only half full with pleanty of seats.  Other customers around had been waiting for their food for over 30 minutes and one guy walked out.  People on their work lunch breaks were obviously stressed which sucks cuz youre on break from work to relax.  I ordered a coke to drink and it was flat. Returned it and then found out they were completely out of CO2.  Service was kind of chaotic and random, never felt like i was being taken care of without asking.  The food was overall pretty good which is why i gave them two stars instead of only 1.  Not the best Thai  i have ever had, but certainly not the worst.  Overall, not a good first impression so will not be coming back next time im in town."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall in what seems like the only strip mall in Elyria to grab lunch for nearby local employees. Visiting our corporate office and we're brought here. Very good Thai food and the hole in the wall feel. Good was very good but not the best Thai I've ever had. I would certainly return next time I visit Elyria"}
{"text":"Love this place.  We come here all the time.  My favorite is the pineapple shrimp curry.  Yummy!  Creamy and spicy, sweet and sour.  Love this dish.  Also the spicy thai noodles .

Service is always good, and the food comes out pretty fast.  Very authentic.

I think the price is pretty good for what you get, quality and excellent ingredients.

Thai Tea, and the Hot teas are great!"}
{"text":"5-star for my overall dining experience. We just drove few miles from the Vegas strip. I never thought that I would find my favorite Thai restaurant here. I can almost eat here everyday. I love Thai food."}
{"text":"I used to love the pad thai here, but a place in LA (forget the name!) has beat is out of the water...theirs in still pretty good though.  Their chicken satay is still my fav though....moist and flavorful.  And the the peanut dipping sauce is tasty too of course.  The service is great here and they packaged all of our leftovers up for us."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai cuisine outside of Thailand. Period. Great service too. The staff is Thai (at least some of it) and happy to accommodate, so feel free to order off the menu, as I do. My only qualm - and this is a purely personal opinion - is that that there is something not quite Feng Shui enough about the layout of the place and the decor to form a perfect harmony with the great Thai food. So I generally pick up."}
{"text":"Met some friends here for Saturday lunch and we decided to dine family style so that we could taste a variety of dishes. The shrimp spring rolls were really refreshing and were the perfect appetizer for the hot day. We had duck curry, a special for the day; the dish was flavorful, with spice level toned down as we requested. The pad thai and the shrimp with asparagus were also tasty, though the seasonings came across to me as more Cantonese than Thai. The charbroiled chicken had a really good flavor, though the meat was a tad on the dry side. The restaurant itself has a very relaxed ambiance and comfortable seating, the service was friendly and fast, and  parking was ample."}
{"text":"Ordered twice from this establishment via Eat24 and was hoping for the best.
Originally order came and I enjoyed my food however when ordering the exact same items the second time I received different items when delivered. Ok while very disappointed I simply asked for a refund on the item that different.
Instead of an apology I was told I was wrong and no refund would be issued.
Def not worth the hassle, food was good but not if it is going to be different every order."}
{"text":"I love this place! BEST crab rangoons in all of Vegas. 

They are always fast and polite, thank you for the awesome food!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite food. I love the Chicken Panang Curry as well as the Cashew Chicken. Reasonably priced. Super convenient carry-out."}
{"text":"Crappy House! Didn't like their food at all. It was plain with not taste! All I tasted was salty food. Order up the beef pai Tay, chicken pai Tay, shrimp soup, seafood salad, egg rolls, Thai house special fried rice. Wasn't satisfied at all! Shame on them!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is great for Thai food. However it really catered to people that don't appreciate authentic Thai food. It is a little bit Americanized hence the deduction for the one star. But I think overall they get the job done if someone is craving Thai food. I don't know of a better type food in the area so this will be just fine for now."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch with my daughter.  Nice steady lunch crowd.  We ordered off the $6.95 lunch menu and an order of fresh spring rolls.

Fresh spring roll- something I order at almost every Thai Restaurant.  Would have to say that these were not the best.  I'm guessing these were made earlier in the day.  Basil was browning and shrimp didn't seem super fresh. Neither of us cared for the dipping sauce.  The vinegar base was overpowering.  We asked for peanut sauce instead, that was better but also not great.  

I ordered mixed veggies with Tofu, fried rice and egg drop soup.  No complaints here. Mine was hot and tasty.

My daughter ordered Chicken Pad Thai, steamed rice and salad.  She said it was good!  

Portions were very generous.  Both of had plenty left to take home 

Service was very attentive and quick

Overall a good dining experience.. can't beat the price!  Might not order fresh spring rolls again but will be back"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say service is the best but it didn't suck while I was there either. Food was considered good for being Americanized Thai food. My taste buds just don't take finely to high sugar contents in American Thai dishes. But I thoroughly enjoyed my pad thai here even tho the sauce was overly sweet. I ordered the veggie pad Thai and this is one of the few Thai places that actually use good veggies in their veggie pad Thai! Not loaded with the cheap veggies like carrots onions bean sprouts Etc. Had a great mix and I was pleasantly surprised! I will be back to try their other vegetarian Thai dishes! Their veggies were fresh and crisp. Also tho Americanized their noodles were the legit kind. Great texture."}
{"text":"Bring an appetite, the portions are massive. Great food and service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"No review needed. Just look at the roach picture taken about 15 mins ago. 


I would post negative stars but I HAVE to rate something. They didn't even apologize!!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but this place was great. I tried the pad Thai and the pad se ew, both dishes were fantastic. He portions were HUGE and the service was excellent! I'll be back here again soon."}
{"text":"This is our go to Thai restaurant at work.  We family style so we've tasted many dishes and I love them all. Staff is nice and delivers in a timely manner!"}
{"text":"Thai tea is good, they were good at substitutions and the orange chicken sauce was sweet and good along with the white rice. 

My lunchmate was not impressed with the spicy basil chicken. It had plenty of spice and chicken , but no basil."}
{"text":"This place is no longer what it once was. This used to be my favorite place to eat lunch. We would go twice a week. But after today It will be hard for me to ever come back. My wife and I arrived at 11:35 and ordered right away. By 12:15 we still had not received our food. So we kindly asked what happened. With no apology she responded \"I just checked, Its not ready.\" I was shocked! 40minutes and still no food and at the time of ordering I believe there was 6 people in the place. It was not busy. I'd say it was just an off day, but this is sadly the second time his has happened to us back to back."}
{"text":"It's my 100th review!!! yay! 

Went here yesterday afternoon for linner it was originally supposed to be a late lunch but my timeliness plus my dinner date's class ending late past 3:30p and traffic on the 101 north coming from tempe made our 4p meeting switch to 5p. Found the place on the left side if going westbound on shea after scottsdale road.

It's always nice to see a good friend especially if you haven't seen them awhile, it makes for great conversation especially over soup, we ordered a bowl of tom yum koong. Now, in other places tom yum is made with lime amongst other things that make this hot and sour soup so fragrant and delicious but this version lacked the limes and in its place were tomatoes and onions. interesting combination. In the broth was plenty of lemongrass, and galangal root, oh, and I must commend them for the amount of shrimp in the bowl, there was plenty, i think between the two of us we both had at least 6 pieces of shrimp. yum!

Honestly what peeved me with this thai restaurant was their lack of lime! It's a simple ingredient necessary for either bringing down the heat of the spice or enhancing the flavor. Michelle my dinner date asked me what I would rate this establishment, and the lack of lime gives this place not a true 4 but like a 3.75. We ordered pad thai, and asked for cilantro as an accompaniment to the noodles to add more flavor, and a chicken green curry. BOTH came in large portions, the pad thai was okay not the best but not bad either, next time i'll try the Pad Se Ew. The green curry was delish, loved the curry and the taste of basil. We had plenty of leftovers and our servers were helpful and available. Overall it was a great dining experience. A must eat/try in the shea corridor."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Had the chicken curry. Omgoodness. Sauce was silky and delicious. Had the level 4 of 5 on the heat scale, should gave gone with 5. Would have been perfect."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick lunch and were pretty impressed. The lunch special was substantial for a low price. The food was good: I had pad Thai and wife had Penang curry.  We also had excellent salad rolls to start.  Singha beer is available in two sizes. Service was pretty good too. The menu includes Thai specialities but also some that look Chinese to me. We will go back!"}
{"text":"So yummy! I get the greens curry every time and it's enough food to feed me for at least three meals!"}
{"text":"If you love Thai food, this place is a must! It is one of the best Thai restaurants that I have found in Arizona. {...and I'm picky about my curry!} They have amazing lunch specials for $6.95 that come with your choice of soup or green salad + steamed rice or fried rice {recommend!} + main course. The best part, they're very large portions! When I'm not taking advantage of their fabulous lunch special, I'm known for grabbing an order of Pad Thai & Mus-sa-mun to-go and bringing it home for dinner when I don't feel like cooking! YUM! One thing to note: It is JAM PACKED at lunch so I would go closer to 11AM when they open!!"}
{"text":"I ended up at Thai House because I was actually really looking to get ~pho'ked up~ this find Sunday afternoon but my first choice Vietnamese place was closed (why anyone would choose to close a pho -- objectively the best hangover cure -- place on Sunday is beyond me) so a bit of bias may creep into this review. 

I got the rice noodle as a sort of consolation effort, so I can't speak for any of the more common Thai dishes (Pad Thai, different fried rices, curries, etc.) they serve, but it was somewhat underwhelming. First, as far as bang for your buck, it was a good amount of food for $9, so no complaints there. As far as flavor, though, the broth was decent but on the mild side and basically just stock, garlic, and green onion. The chicken and shrimp were honestly pretty bland, and I had to dump in the chili and soy sauces to spice it up (side note: the chili/spice selection is also lacking - they only have that red paste you can find in any supermarket next to the sriracha). The noodles had a good, firm texture with few clumps. 

For what it is, rice noodle soup, I suppose it's on par; the dish itself isn't supposed to be packed with flavor. But if you're looking for a pho alternative, something with a rich and beefy broth, I don't think this does the job. 

It's also unfair to judge Thai House with my pho tinted glasses on, so if I'm ever back in the area and want a more conventional Thai dish, I would definitely check this place out again."}
{"text":"The panang curry lunch special is awesome."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Thai House as I was looking for some Thai food in Scottsdale. Overall I thought that it was an OK experience but I'm not sure if I would come back here again. Despite what others have said about their Pad Thai being excellent I thought it was nothing special and wish I had ordered something else instead. However, their curry was pretty good and I'm glad that I got to try that out. Maybe I should have gotten the spicy fried rice instead of the Pad Thai but originally thought that might have been too much rice for me.

On a more positive note they do give you generous portions for the food if you're really hungry and the service was decent as people did check up on my table to see if everything was okay."}
{"text":"I have tried many Thai restaurants and hands down this place makes the best curry. The Panang and green curries are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Better than archies. Large portions,  beautifully presented with orchids. But it is my favorite because of the tastes.  Tried something new called pad woon sen with tofu. Love it"}
{"text":"Prepared Chicken apad Thai in same pot they prepared fish. Pad Thai was very fishy and contained bits and pieces of fish from another dish."}
{"text":"Modest prices and incredibly authentic Thai food. This spot is a local gem just 15min from the Vegas strip. We've been here many times and the quality is always consistent.  Definitely try the Chicken Pad Thai, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I think this is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite Thai place in town. They do not disappoint. The green curry is fantastic! The service is attentive and they are very friendly. Watch the spice level, because this place is the real deal! Go low. :) You can always add more. The portions are generous, no matter which entrée you order and there's plenty of rice! It's an easy in and out with door side parking. Go for lunch or dinner. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really love the food here!!! My husband got Pad Tai with shrimp.. I got a noodle curry thing with shrimp. I over ate it was so yummy. It's also clean, and has great service.. Definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"2 hours no food. Called the restaurant and the woman answering the phone couldn't find my order and asked me if I had ordered from \"Thai House\". I will never order from here again. No follow up or attempt to make it right."}
{"text":"Red and green curry should not be called curry. Vegetable oil sitting on top of colored water."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for over 4 years.  I always ordered either Pad Thai or the Basil Chicken without even looking at the menu.   I was always satisfied with these choices until I decided to read the menu since I was craving curry. OMG I have been missing the most awesome yellow curry, the creamy coconut sauce, the potatoes, yum.  I am hooked.  I can't wait to have this again."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurant in town. Must try the yellow curry chicken,curry  panang, and mostly the pad Thai!!!! Even the service is very good and friendly."}
{"text":"this place is so packed at lunch time and that's because it's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!! 

i can never seem to order anything other than the yellow curry. i get a level 3 heat. i often get it to go and take it back to work.

i have dined in a time or two for their lunch special which is dirt cheap and enough food for left overs. it comes with your selection of main entree, soup or salad, and choice of rice. 

it's seriously so good. 

if you're on a lunch break you can easily enjoy a quick sit down meal here."}
{"text":"The food is fresh,  delicious,  cheap,  and served in generous portions.  I ordered tofu, eggplant, green beans,  and bell peppers in a spicy red curry paste (not sauce) with a side of brown rice.  The food came out hot, tasted fresh as the green beans were tender and crispy, and the tofu really absorbed the paste well to form a good crust - almost chicken like - for the pan fry. Best of all, for 10.95 the portion was massive,  definitely enough for 2 meals (but it was so good I ate the entire entree )"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!!   I had gone there twice before and the yellow curry was amazing.   Last night, I took my boyfriend and boy, was that a mistake.   He ordered the Chicken Teriyaki....after one bite, he pushed the plate away.   It was a huge pile of flavorless chicken in a tasteless sauce.   I was SHOCKED!   My Yellow Curry showed up and again, disappointed.  The curry had very little flavor...I was embarrassed because I had made a point of saying how wonderful their curry was.
When I mentioned it to our English speaking waitress, she never came back but sent the non English speaking waitress for the rest of our meal.
That was my last time going there."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and very good food.  Their spicey hot scale of 1-10 is great.  The 10 is the just right hot.  Get a little sweat going but can still taste the food."}
{"text":"One of my staples for lunch (and it's next to a Staples...) is Thai House.  The food is solid, yet a bit pricy in my opinion.  For instance, a bowl of my favorite soup (Tom Yum) is $8.95.  I think that's a bit steep.  On the other hand, they have a lunch special for $7 that gets you a cup of soup (just egg drop) or salad, and rice and lunch plate.  Beware of the small size of the place and how busy it can get for lunch.  You may end up waiting 20 minutes or so for a table... I suggest getting there at 11:45 or earlier if  you want to sit right away."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff.
Took my friend's son for his first try of Thai - while he may not have pad Thai again any time soon, he's 8, the staff helped him pick his dish. I'll go back."}
{"text":"I do not know if I should be writing a review for a place that I never actually ate the food. I was excited when I got the advertisment in the mail for this thai restaraunt. The writing in the menu was in thai. I did notice that some of the thai translations did not match the english ones, but I thought this was due to the printer. When my husband, daughter and I arrived we were sad to find out that neither the server, the owner or cook were Thai or could speak Thai. I ask basic question on the preparation of things on the menu and could not get a real answer.  I hope someone else actually eats here and posts a review. I'd like to know if this is real Thai food or just called thai food. After we coul'nt get a answer we decided to skip eating here as it appeared very pricey.  I wonder why the menu is printed in both Thai and English when no one there actually speaks Thai?"}
{"text":"I love the Penang Curry at the Thai House! Better than any other place I've had. Too, the lunch special is one of the best deals in town. The spring rolls are pretty good, although I'm not crazy about the sauce, it's a bit too thick and sticky for my liking. The service is okay, during lunch they could use additional help, servers are literally jogging to service their tables. Overall, it's a great spot - I'm definitely eating there a few times a month if not more."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been ordering from this place for over year and half now. We loved the food and the delivery was always early.

But for the last 4 months the delivery service has been late and at one time they did not delivered our food. They argued we did not place the order when i have an email confirming the order. 

Today the delivery was 20 minutes late. When I called to follow up, the lady was rude on the phone. The lemon chicken was saggy, my favorite fried rice tasted like fish instead of beef. 

Contemplating if I should continue giving them my business or not. So sad as I enjoyed their food before."}
{"text":"I ordered my normal 'first time at a new Thai restaurant' dish - panang beef (lunch special).

It was a very good sized helping, and I liked the assortment of vegetables in the panang, but the sauce was very sweet and the coconut taste was stronger than usual - while I was eating, I had the mental impression of coconut shrimp as the aftertaste.
Spice level was right where it should be for a 3 (I'm always conservative on my first trip).

Would have been perfect if not quite as sweet!"}
{"text":"Holy cow... a ton of food for $7! Nothing better than finding a great lunch bargain. Staff sooo sweet on top of it. Great place if you want to get stuffed!"}
{"text":"Great - very reasonable price. Much better than Krachai Thai food. Everyone was friendly and attentive.  We received twice the portions than we received from Krachai Thai.  Excellent flavors.  Some of the best curry I have had. I asked for extra potatoes and wow I was surprised the extra amount I received. We will return.  The place was packed with Thai food lovers  
This place is our new hangout now we will never have return to Krachai Thai ever again.  This place is so efficient it does 5x the volume of most Thai Restaurants. 
We Loved it."}
{"text":"Ran in here for take-out... a teeny bit awkward as there is no hostess area at all to order at so you just kind of stand there amongst the diners asking the server for what you would like as you quickly scan the paper menu. The server however, was very nice.
I ordered one of the 2 most popular dishes - the pad thai (of course) so I could see what this restaurant could do (first time here) 
Quick to order, it only took about 5 min for it to be ready. I ordered extra spicy pad thai without egg. $13.95 with shrimp, tofu and chicken - not bad by Calgary standards, IMO. The portion was average.
I liked the width of the noodles here, they are just like what I cook with at home, a little wider than what most places serve and they were cooked well.
The chicken was ok, the shrimp were not of the nice, big, juicy, butterflied variety. They were just a tad larger than salad shrimp and frozen of course. I love the rare gem Thai places where they cook with fresh shrimp and I do not mind paying extra for this but alas, this is not the case here. The tofu I can take or leave it and next time, I will omit it. It adds nothing to the dish for me and I do not enjoy the texture of it. The veg in the dish was thinly sliced red and green pepper. The dish had a red/orange hue to it that I had never seen before on pad thai - was this the extra spice? My mouth did not really register a heat level at all. I enjoyed the peanuts on the side but the dish cried out for some fresh lime. And maybe some bean sprouts.
All in all, an ok dish. I would go back but would order something else next time. I would not be opposed to eating in either. The place was small but quaint, clean and again, the short order service I received was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Very fresh and tasty. Very well priced a for big portions. Two can eat off one order. My Fav place for Thai food."}
{"text":"Been eating here for 2 years now, at least 2 times a week and it rarely disappoints. Can't beat the quality, quantity and price of the lunch specials.  

My favorites are the Panay Chicken and Pad Thai Chicken. 

Busy place at lunch but fast turn times. 

A recommend from me for sure."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I went in this past December and encountered cockroaches at my table. I screamed (because they're creepy) and took pictures. The manager came over with our bill and talked to us, chalking it up to the location saying, \"it's Vegas\".  Nothing was comped (honestly this isn't that big of a deal, but there were literally cockroaches on the wall... You'd think they'd want to bribe us into not telling anyone) and we will never return.  

I apologize for taking so long to write the review, I just felt bad thinking about what could happen to their business, but I recently told a friend about the experience who convinced me I should."}
{"text":"\"Jack talk Thai, Jack talk Thai real well\" that line from Meet the Fockers always comes to mind whenever we discuss having Thai food for lunch.

Thai House is quite possibly one of the most convenient, partly one of the most cost effective and yummy Thai food eateries in my neck of the woods (if you're ordering the lunch specials that is). 

Little things in life excite me so the mere fact you can order your lunch online and pick it up with little to no waiting involved brings an immediate smile to my face! Who likes waiting? I don't.

Food. YUM! The portions are more than generous, flavors consistently delicious, always a friendly staff and convenient for my lunch and dinner dining excursions. My only gripe is the inconsistent levels of heat. A spice level (3) one day may not be the same as a spice level (3) another day.

All in all Thai House is a great eatery if you're in the area, and an especially good deal if you can take advantage of their superior lunch specials and special lunch pricing.

Give it a whirl y'all"}
{"text":"This by far is the BEST Thai restaurant here in Las Vegas.  Being from California where there is a good variety of Thai restaurants, it was hard to find a place here in Vegas that could even compare....but we finally did!  The service is wonderful as everyone is very friendly!  We eat here at least once or twice a week and have delivery as well.  Their Thai crispy pork with chinese broccoli, Coconut soup, and Chicken Chili Mint is to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. Good portions and good quality. Would have given 5 stars but the spice isn't consistent. You order with spice 1 to 5 with 5 being the hottest. I always order 3 and sometimes it's very spicy and sometimes bland."}
{"text":"***Update from my prior review on 10/23/2011***

I don't know what happened to this place.  The food has been reduced in portions, the online ordering menu does not duplicate their in house or take out menu.  The customer service lately is HORRIBLE!  I placed my order online and my email confirmation stated my order would be ready by 8:09 pm.  I arrive at 8:13 pm and  usually, my food would be ready. 8:15.....8:25....8:35....8:40 my food was not ready.  I get a half apology by the guy who runs the place with a helpless expression on his face.  Didn't even offer me water or a small Thai Ice Tea while waiting.  I ordered my food online over an hour ago!  The waitresses scurrying around looking all stressed out.  Yes it was busy (all tables filled) and yes there were tons of orders on the counter (take out or other online orders).  But I just sat there without any acknowledgement or update on my food.  The only communication I had was with the waitress who confirmed my order when I walked to the counter and took my payment BEFORE my food was ready.  I always get asked for my payment when she has my take out ready and on the counter.  To top if off,  the staff just seemed so mechanical when I'm sitting in the booth closest to the register and they are tallying their pending take out and online orders (money) on their ten key in front of me. Without looking my way, acknowledging me or again, offering me something for the LONG wait.  I finally said something at 8:43 and all of the sudden. They come out with all my food.  They may not know me personally, but they do know I order at least 4-5 dishes from them at an average of $8-10 per dish not including tip every time I go.  I think I'll find another Thai restaurant to eat at."}
{"text":"The place is rather on the small side, but the service was great.  I ordered the fried wontons and the pork massaman (no one has ever accused me of being PC).  I was disappointed that there was no Thai beer available.  The wontons were excellent.  The massaman was delicious and the portions beyond generous.  I had ordered the massaman with medium spice- I got it mild.  No problem.  I spooned some of the mystery hot sauce table side and brought the dish to heat.  Price wise, this place is hard to beat."}
{"text":"I appreciate this place. The women tend to cater to their men customers more than they would a woman;perhaps hoping to be taken up by hand in marriage who knowsOne thing for certain is that you can count on authenticity in flavor and they maintain a clean environment as well. Give it a try and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Is it just me, or has all asian food seemingly morphed into a hodgepodge of the same 5 dishes. Meat, a few vegetables swimming in a thick sugary sauce. At Thai house, you get a nice break from this monotony. This evening I ordered the Spicy Thai Noodles. Wide flat noodles, with onions, red bell peppers, and fresh basil. It was fantastic. As far as I can tell there was no sauce to speak of. Just a mild flavored oil tossed with slightly charred noodles, beef and veggies. I actually tasted each ingredient. Nothing on my plate was overwhelmed by anything else. Perfect. 

I also like how you can specify your order's spiciness on a scale of 1-5. If you really want a kick, the scale actually goes up to 15, but only insiders know about that. 

The service is very friendly as well as fast. A little too fast for my taste as I only read about 10 pages in my book before I was done and the bill arrived. 

Next time I will stall 'em somehow.... or order an appetizer."}
{"text":"We were not loving this place. The service left a lot to be desired with their rotten attitude which could have been overlooked if their food was decent which it isn't. I recommend skipping this place and trying another Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat well and not have to pay a lot for your meal.  Great food, great value!"}
{"text":"I stopped by to pick up some Thai curry dish to take home.  The food was delicious, the service was prompt and the portions were generous.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Food Was Excellent!

I had Yellow Curry Chicken. The meal was so rich and filling I could only eat 1/3 of it! I took the remainder home with some extra white rice and my wife and I split the meal.

She said that was the best she had eaten and we're both Thai food lovers.

Definitely worth a visit. This was my 1st. It's kind of hidden or set back so you have to look for it. It's near Best Buy off the 101 loop in Scottsdale, that's where I ate.

I can't wait to go back and try another dish!

Enjoy

~Stew~"}
{"text":"Finally a good Thai joint.  The place is super casual but the dishes are tasty.  Try their signature spicy red curry catfish entree.  Everything else is quite good so come and get your Thai food here.  They have decent portions and prices but I noticed they don't offer much pork options."}
{"text":"Lets start with the dining area. This place has more than enough seating.  The tables are evenly spaced so you can have a nice conversation within your party.  They have a nice section in the back in the event you have a large party.  They also have a stage where they have live music usually during the weekend evenings.  I love how the place is decorated.  

I enjoy the food here.  Nothing special that I would say stands out but the good thing is that its consistent in taste.  They have a large menu so you definitely have a lot of choices. They also have a lunch special during the week day so that definitely is a plus. 

The staff is really friendly although some do have a strong accent so you may need to repeat yourselves or ask them to repeat your order just to make sure they got it correct.  They try their best to assist you but I do feel they are under staffed.  When the place gets busy the staff seem to be overworked.  They try their best to serve you but I can see they are sometimes doing too much.  So be weary that during busy times your water or drinks may not be filled timely but the staff is always respectful and treat you very well. 

Price for the food is very fair.  It's about the same prices as any Asian restaurant.  Average ala carte dish is about $8.95-$12.95.  The amount of food they give per dish is a good amount.  2 dishes will usually feed a part of 2-3 easily. I do think at times the food takes longer to cook but this gives you time to enjoy a good conversation with your friend or date.  Don't go here if your really hungry and expect to go in and out. 

Overall, I do come back and forth to this location many times and quite often do take out as the food is good. Sometimes I do crave their bean sprouts with crispy pork so that dish definitely gets me to come back.  I see the owner here often and he is such a nice fella always sharing his stories.  Talks with his guest."}
{"text":"I really like Thai House even though I thought it looked pretty sketchy the first time I went there. I got over that quickly after walking in and seeing how clean it was. Also, while we waited for and then ate our food there were three people who came in to pick up takeout (like a sign from God!) 

JD and I both loved the Tom Kha Gai soup-so tasty! I had red curry chicken at 3* spicy, which wasn't hardly as spicy as I like it but sometimes I get spice-shy. Anyway- it was good and I added chile paste myself to jazz it up more. The overall flavor was really nice and full. JD had the spicy basil noodles with chicken and they were some awesome noodles! The plate was piled high and he was smart enough to ask for more *'s and didnt have to do as much spice doctoring to his dish.

All in all, I really like this place and grabbed a to-go menu to return the next time I've over this way."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I'm new to the world of Thai. It wasn't but a few years ago that I was actually a Thai-virgin. I still keep it somewhat basic with simple dishes like pad-thai, bbq-chicken, pot stickers, etc. After eating at Thai House I think it's time to start venturing out a little deeper in the Thai food world.

First, their food is really good. The Pad Thai portion is enough to feed 3-4 people. The BBQ chicken is moist and has great flavor. The pot stickers might be the best I've had. I prefer steamed and they are gooey and don't fall apart. Great texture and the meat inside just melts in your mouth. My new favorite item on the menu are the Salad Rolls. Particularly the sweet and spicy dipping sauce topped with crushed peanuts that accompanies it.  That alone is worth the price of admission. Actually all of their dipping sauces are amazing. The peanut sauce is off da hook. 

The ambiance is very nice, but the service could use a little improvement. On our most recent trip to this establishment we were waited on by someone who spoke no English. It was a bit frustrating when we were trying to get some detail about the items we were ordering. Also, I highly recommend dining when the incomparable Skip Eaton is performing some great classic rock hits."}
{"text":"Decent menu which includes the traditional satay, tom yum koong, curries, pad thai etc. What threw me off was teriyaki, sweet and sour chicken, kung pao, chow mein. Food is good with great portions! Careful on the heat scale. 10 is blazin...
Weird thing....I was really thirsty after the meal. Usually that's the result of using the other type of SaLt. 
Overall the place is clean, modern, and staff are attentive. Curries are 10 bones, Fried rice at 9, and most entrees at 9 bones! Price is a buck plus more than our So Cal places. Give it a try, food is good, and service is fast.  
Damm..I need to drink another bottle of soda!!!
."}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was bad! 
I had to get up and get my own to go boxes , ask for napkins and water and no one ever checked on us after serving our food."}
{"text":"This is my regular Thai restaurant. My good friend introduced me to the place when I was pregnant with my second son. I ate chicken yellow curry and coconut eggroll all the time. That could have been the cause of my 200lb pregnancy. And yes my baby only weighted 6lbs.

1. This place is located in a strip mall next to Smith's. Easy to access and always lots of parking available.

2. The decor is very traditional Thai, spacious, and lots of seating. It's also very clean which is very important to me.

3. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive making sure to bus dishes, refill water, and wrap up our leftovers.

4. The food:

Tom Khaa soup w/ chicken- the chicken was perfect, the flavor had the right amount sweet and sour plus creaminess. I took home the leftovers and ate with rice noodles the next day. OMG!

Beef salad w/ side of sticky rice- I love the beef salad here.  The dressing is always done right, steak is thinly sliced, vegetable is always fresh and with sticky rice on the side. That's a winning combination.

I can't remember the name of the noodles. I seen the pics on yelp and it said award winning noodles of 2011, so that's what I asked for. My older boy enjoyed it but it wasn't for me. It was to oily and had a funny taste to me. Maybe I'm more of a pad Thai kind of girl. I recommend giving it a try and see what you think. If it was voted award winning 2011 I must be wrong.

Chicken Yellow curry- I always order this everywhere I go. It wasn't watery and had the right consistency that is sits nicely on rice. The curry flavor is always done right and you can taste the different spicy they put into the curry.

Thai tea- its always amazing here and it has the perfect sweetness. I usually have this at the Vietnamese restaurants I go to. I guess if you want it done right go to a Thai restaurant.

Mango & strawberry boba- the boys enjoyed it but it tasted like what I would imagine a car air freshener would taste like. Boba was on the gummy side. They all liked my Thai tea better. 

All and all this is a good restaurant and they offer delivery and carry out. Try out for yourself you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for lunch during the week. It can be very busy but there is such a quick turn around that you never have to wait for very long to get seated. Their lunch specials are so cheap and excellent quality and large portions. I like the pad Thai and the Penang curry. The ambiance is lacking, but the food is top notch. All for under ten bucks!!"}
{"text":"A gem. Delicious, lovely presentation. We enjoyed Ragoon and Fried Wonton appetizer. Dinner was Pad Thai (best we've ever had), Thai house fried rice, papaya salad (slightly spicy).  Plenty of food for four with leftovers. Finished off the evening with Mango Sticky Rice--- highly recommend!!!  Can't wait to eat here again."}
{"text":"Great little place to eat & always busy. We order Thai food every single Monday for lunch. You can't best the prices for the portion sizes."}
{"text":"Another Thai restaurant in a strip mall was what I thought as we pulled up, opened the door and stepped inside, yup just as I thought same old same old.
We were graciously greeted and quickly seated at our table, handed our ice water and menus and were left alone while we looked at the menu.
The menu is quite large but broken up into appetizers, vegetables, curry's, noodles & rice, seafood, entrees, salads and soups.
There were 5 of us so we ordered one green curry, one yellow curry, pad Thai noodles, spicy chili mint and tom yum soup, all ranging from 5 to 8 on their spicy scale.
First to come out of the kitchen was the soup, looked OK but the taste was fantastic, the chicken was moist and tasty, the lemongrass just lingered on your tonuge and the spiciness was just enough to give you a bit of heat but not too over powering, and there was enough for 5 of us and more.
The yellow and green chicken curry was very flavorful with generous chunks of potatoes, carrots and lots of nice white meat chicken. 
The pad Thai noodles were probably the best I have ever had in Las Vegas, all the other pad Thai noodles I have had in Las Vegas have been a little on the greasy side, not these, the noodles were perfectly cooked not mushy and the spice was spot on, just enough but not too much.
The best thing out of everything was the chicken spicy chili mint, nice diced chicken over a large bed of vegetables and the portion was huge, we had a number 8 on the spice scale and it was just fine.
For such an average looking place in a strip mall, I would say the food, service and the cost was WAY better than some of the other fancy Thai places in town.
Oh and one more thing, they deliver too....Win Win in my book."}
{"text":"I have eaten in Thai restaurants all over the US due to my job.  This rates among the worst I have had.  Not sure where to start.  The vegetable soup tastes like it was made with bullion, the papaya salad was so salty we could not eat it and the pad thai was just weird and not at all flavored like anything I have ever had at a Thai restaurant.  Service -prompt at first but once the food was delivered we were forgotten.  The door was open at our table on a very \"cold Phoenix day\" and we closed it.  A server came along and opened it, I explained we closed it because it was cold and he continued to prop it open and not say a word. . . . there are much better Thai restaurants in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great food at good prices. I have eaten here consistently over the past 6 years and I'm rarely dissapointed. They always make it right in the end."}
{"text":"Always great Thai cuisine. Love the wonton soup, chicken satay and they have the best chicken pad Thai. Yum!"}
{"text":"The overall review makes me sad... this is my favorite Thai place I think it should be 5 stars across the board. 
I love the tom yum soup, the chicken chili mint and chicken panang."}
{"text":"Terrible service. We were there for an hour and never served our food. We finally left. We were looking for a new Thai spot and this certainly wasn't it. Would never suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Often over used. Thai House 3 locations R THE BEST Thai food restaurants in not only Scottsdale but also Phoenix, State of Arizona & hard pressed 2 find a better Thai restaurant on my travels to San Diego, Los Angeles or San Francisco Bay Area.
As I've been 2 Thailand 20 times, Thai House Panang Curry is as good as you'd find in Bangkok, Koh Samui or Chaing Mai. 100%. Phad Thai is spot on 2. This is THE place 2 go 4 Thai food - hands down. Nuff said."}
{"text":"SO YUMMY! If you want a chance to try it with out fear go for lunch. The portions are smaller so it takes some of the fear out of trying something new and different. Now that is not to say that you wont be going back to the office with an empty tummy, you will be leaving full and satisfied and craving it! My suggestion is order up the #32 and thank me later. :)"}
{"text":"Waste NOT Want NOT!

Had the Tom Yum Soup:  was extremely fishy tasting.  They explained that there must have been too much fish sauce and they took it back without our small dishes that had portions of our soup with the majority of the chicken.  We were surprised that when it was returned; it was the original soup we gave them (with less chicken cause minus what we took out when we first tried it) to which they must have put more seasoning in to curb the fishiness.  

We wouldn't have had a problem with keeping the original soup had they put our bowls of soup back in but now we had less meat and mostly broth left since it was thrown away before the 'fixed' soup arrived by another server.  Also, we wouldn't have minded them not wasting the dish (but since they threw away the majority of our original dish); they should've added some chicken back into the soup and not been so 'cheap'.

Server asked if we wanted to order anything else and we politely said no since we didn't want to chance another poor food experience.  Server was sweet was the only consolation since we left hungry with less money since they also charge extra for rice.  Back to Malee's Thai Bistro we go!"}
{"text":"Great food and very well priced for the portions.  We tried the spring rolls, green curry with chicken, and pad see ew w/ Beef.  All were some of the best I've had in years, and certainly some of the best in the valley.   

Update:

We've been back here at least 10 times and it's always great.   The north scottsdale location however isn't as good, get to the shea location."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I had the ginger chicken (my standard when I eat Thai).  My Mom had a yellow curry tofu that was pretty good as well.  We also had a Satay appetizer that was really good and came with a peanut sauce and pickled onions and cucumbers.  Everything was fresh, the portions were huge, and the service was really fast and friendly.  A great girls lunch."}
{"text":"Friendly employees work here and treat the customers well.  Every experience has been excellent.  The food tastes delicious. Seating is clean, comfortable and plentiful.  I wish I had more time in general to sit down and dine in because the space is so inviting and the staff makes you feel like staying.  I dislike ordering to go so often but I love the taste and have a busy schedule.  

Of particular note was Thanksgiving weekend.  They featured Pan-Asian instrumental music, live dancing and singing, and other entertainment on the stage up front.  It was a nice touch.  It would be nice if I lived closer to the restaurant :-).  Please dine here if you like positive experiences."}
{"text":"This is good Thai!  Save yourself some time searching the menu.  Go for the Green Cury with shrimp or chicken.  I had them leave out the green peppers and add eggplant ($1 upcharge) Awesome!!  Beware, these are large entrees.  Enough for 2 unless you are a big eater.  I suggest having and appetizer and sharing an entree.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I ever had. The food is AMAZING!! Portions are very GENEROUS!"}
{"text":"Great for take out.  I recently picked up the egg rolls, red curry with chicken, and spicy noodles.  All were delicious.  They gave a huge portion of the red curry, which was very fortunate because otherwise I would have had to go back the next day for more, it was so good.  The spicy noodles were excellent too.  The egg rolls were pretty standard and probably not worth all the grease.

I will say that if you want seriously spicy food, you will have to be very clear about that when ordering.  They asked me how spicy I wanted my food on a scale of 1-5.  The spicy noodles at a level 3 weren't spicy at all.  With the level 4 red curry I could taste some heat but it wasn't very intense.  So on that scale, I don't know if the 5 would satisfy true spice-o-holics but I bet if you say you want super hot they could make it happen.  

I just have two gripes with this place: 1. They use evil styrofoam containers.  2. They are closed on Sundays.  Also I wouldn't recommend dining there.  Just order your stuff for pick up.  The place is pretty small and sparse and there were only two people in there when I picked up my order."}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch special, I guess they dont do that on Sundays. I was pretty close to leaving (to Sushi Mon, because they have lunch specials on Sundays). Food has always been good. 

But I opted for their daily $5 deals. They are mounted on the walls, but lack any descriptions. I asked my waittress to describe what is in them, she had a heavy accent so that did not help either. 

I had the Thai Pho, its chicken, which is not advertised. You can ask for meatballs, the waittress said they can remove some chicken to add them. Its a small bowl.

The hot wings looks like a buffalo flavor but its actually sweet chili.

Overheard 2 other customers ask for the lunch special. Hmm, maybe they should do something about that..."}
{"text":"I like this place for the reasonably priced lunches so wanted to try it for dinner. I was not disappointed.
The lunch specials are a great value and include a small soup.
Dinner is a good (larger) portion with slightly higher prices and no soup included. I love soup so for dinner I ordered the Tom Yum soup with shrimp, they have chicken and beef ( and tofu I think) but never thought it should be with anything but shrimp. It is a great tasting soup, hot with big shrimp (:)) and lots of flavor. 
For dinner I had the garlic cashew chicken. A big plate with white rice. Delicious. I would have preferred a little more garlic in a sauce but it was a good meal with a little of leftovers for the next day. 
What made the meal better was the lady and gentleman singing karaoke on the small stage. They really enjoyed singing and it made dinner very enjoyable. I am not sure if they are there every night ( I was there on a Tuesday?) but it really made for a good time. The gentleman told me I was welcome to come up and sing but I wouldn't want to ruin everyone's dinner that way! It is one of those things I have seen on tv but never been to before. Keep up the great work guys, I will swing by next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place and have dropped in for lunch countless times. Now, I'm usually the kind of person that likes to try everything in a restaurant but I have only had three items off of Thai House's menu. Those are: The Panang Curry, The Spicy Basil Chicken and The Chicken Special. 

I love curry...I mean L-O-V-E curry! It's probably one of my favorite foods no matter the region from which it originates. This might lead one to believe that the Panang is my favorite dish, but it's not. After the first time I tried the Chicken Special, I was absolutely hooked. It's only available at lunch but, if you're a chicken fan, this is the dish I highly recommend. The spices they use for the chicken are phenomenal, and they go so well with sauce that is served with the dish. This special keeps me coming back time after time.

With that, all I really have to say is that I usually get out of here spending about $10. Add that together with the happy service I always get and you can call me a regular."}
{"text":"DH and I stopped in here for a quick weekday lunch, right around 12. The placed was *packed*, but we immediately were given a seat and menus, and service was super quick while also being welcoming and friendly. They seemed to be having a good time in the hour-long chaos of the lunch rush. :-)

We ordered off of the lunch menu on the back on the main menus, where for $7 you can choose an entree, a type of rice (steamed or fried), and a soup or salad. We went with a hodge podge of everything so we could try as much as possible. You're not going to go wrong with literally anything on the menu, but if I had to choose right now I'd go with the Yellow Curry again. One of the best Thai curries I've ever had; most places I find to be waaaay too sweet with all the coconut milk. Thai House's was perfect!

The serving sizes are generous, especially if you're not dining with someone willing to eat half of what's on your plate. We did our best, but still ended up leaving with leftovers - which only got better over time. 

If you're muy gringo like moi, stay on the mild side of Thai House's spicy scale (maybe a 2 out of 5). Otherwise, go to town - they even have extra sambal and sriracha on the table in case you need it. 

We had a great time here, and a great meal. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is Amazing and the staff is so friendly. A must try if you crave some Thai ;)"}
{"text":"We love the Thai House, the food is great. As many of the past reviews mentioned. I don't care for spicy food at all so whenever I order the red cury (delish) I always get a ZERO because it still comes out with spice, so rate low if you don't want too much of a mouth burn.

The only thing I was disappointed about was when my little boy wanted regular fried rice, no veggies, no meat, just rice and the soy sauce and they charged us $8.00 - would have thought it would be less.

Other than that, everything is pretty good.

The lunch combos are good but the salad that it comes with needs to be worked on. I suggest the soup.

Fast and delish!"}
{"text":"Crab rangoons are good!  I love their curry and pad Thai!  They deliver in the Inspirada/Seven hills area!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for five years now. I'm not too into Asian good however Thai House is by far my favorite. I've moved since I originally found this spot and can't find anything better. I just ordered delivery as was surprised they actually deliver to my new location. My order arrived quicker than expected and just as good as if I did takeout! I really wish I had done this earlier."}
{"text":"This is the worst Thai food I have ever had in my life! We ordered Tom Yum chicken soup not enough flavor over cooked chicken, Sesame chicken the sauce was so nasty we ended up throwing that away, Pad Thai horrible taste super greasy. I was so upset we got all of this to go got home and realized how nasty their food is I am so upset I wasted my money on their food NEVER AGAIN! Please avoid this place at all costs way to many great Thai restaurants out there!"}
{"text":"Very rude staff. Things used to be good here but have become hit or miss. I feel sorry for the owners who may not know how badly their male staff especially treats their customers."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this establishment's physical location. I have ordered from them through Eat 24 numerous times. A couple of occasions they were late, understandable since I put those orders in around noon where they're busiest. Anyway, I was treated to a birthday lunch on a Sunday at this place. The lady attending our table (I should've remembered her name) took our orders and was quite pleasant (for now). 

So we ordered appetizers tofu and Thai beef salad. Tofu  came in quick. But then our first entrée came in and still no sign of the salad. So we just grubbed along rather than having the food go cold. The rest of the entrées came but still no sign of that Thai salad. So I asked the lady what was going on with the salad, and she just shrugged us off a bit and said it's on its way. The table opposite us was a party of 14 guests. She was attentive to them and not our little party of four. Guess coz she gets more tips from that size party. 

We we're halfway through the Pad Thai when lo and behold, the salad came in. Well we still ate it, I mean it's good food. So we asked for the bill after cleaning off our plates and I amusingly asked the lady if there was a birthday discount, she was stern and said \"No we don't have a birthday discount\". At least greet the person (me) a happy birthday. 

The whole place wasn't even that busy. There was us, 4-man table, a party of 14, and 2 other tables. I guess it makes sense why a few people were there for Sunday lunch, I guess everyone knows their service sucks so they'd rather enjoy ordering and eating at home (which I wish I'd done instead of driving all the way out there).

To be fair, I'll say it again, they're food is great. The older gentleman that delivers my food when I place an online order always has a smile on his face. But that lady, oh boy. I wish that she was just having a bad day and not like that to everyone.

So will I order food from them online? Maybe. Will I visit that establishment again? NO. For the record that was my first time visiting their restaurant. First impressions last. 1 Star for the food. Service is a big criteria for me and Thai House, unfortunately was a disappointment."}
{"text":"Wow! Great place for lunch...delicious, generous portions and very reasonably priced at $6.99!  Dinner prices are also reasonable.
Great healthy vegan option, too: Vegetables and Tofu with steamed brown rice. (Brown rice is $1 extra at lunch, but well worth it!) Also comes with salad or soup. Great find!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food in the valley. Everything is absolutely excellent. The tofu is perfectly cooked and decadent. Panang curry is unmatched. Even down to the rice, I can only describe the food at Thai House as perfectly cooked. The spice system is a little fuzzy--I would call 5 \"medium,\" 10 would be \"hot,\" and Thai Hot really starts at 15. The house Cabernet is quite good as well. Service is great, atmosphere is comfortable. Highly recommend Thai House."}
{"text":"Love this place everytine I go. Good service. Great food and a lovely mom pop feel of atmosphere. Def. One of my fav places to go in Vegas. 
I Favorite foods are of course Pad Thai, Green Curry, Tom Yum, Fried Shrimp, and Larb to name a few. They have a great Lunch combo and Dinner is perfect for sharing with family and friends. Never had bad service and getting it togo is also great! 
I have not found a place like this anywhere in vegas yet. Good price good food and good service. A must go."}
{"text":"Not a bad little Thai restaurant.  Considering the area, there aren't a lot of choices here, so this one isn't a bad choice if you live in the area.  I decided to stop by here after a short visit to Khoury's.  I ordered the crab rangoon, and the green curry with beef.

I wasn't that impressed with the crab rangoon.  It was over priced, and just not that good.  I liked the cream cheese filling ok, with it's herbs.  The shell however was that store-bought, thin, almost candy like shell.  The sweet and sour was pretty standard as well.  I'd recommend skipping on this particular appetizer.

The green curry was a little better.  It was made from the typical canned stuff, along with an herb or two that made it a little unique.  It had some sweetness added to it even though I ordered it without extra sweetness (I don't know if they held back or not on the added sugar).  The dish was served with the standard bamboo, zucchini, and a red and green pepper or two.  The best part of the dish was the beef though.  It was nice and tender, and really easy to chew.  I quite enjoyed it!

They had live music on a Wednesday night, which was cool.  Just some older fellow with a guitar, but that is better than no live music!  The service was a bit slow, but they were quite busy for a Wednesday night.  There are a few interesting dishes on the menu that I wish I would have ordered instead of the curry.  I might return if I am in the area to try some different stuff."}
{"text":"Hmmm.  Food is good here but service is poor. The servers are quite pouty, they do not smile and they take forever to take your order.  However, there is the busperson who is always going here, there and everywhere.  She is very hardworking!  Curry is good, good lunch portions, lots of good lunch special choices.  The pineapple fried rice is awesome!  One of the best that I have tasted.  A favorite is gung ka ree, yellow curry.  It is so tasty that I can just eat the curry sauce over rice and will be completely satisfied.  A con in this place is the extra charge on rice?  Really?  Rice is not that expensive, last time I checked!  Thai House has good food though, so give them a tray but avoid the lunch crowd.  It gets very busy..."}
{"text":"READ THIS BEFORE EATING HERE!!!
Portions are HUGE - family style. Each portion can serve at least 3-4 people. We all ordered individually and realized when we got our food that we should have shared. 
The food was excellent. All food was seasoned well and served hot. Service was good. It's a small place in a strip mall type center that you would normally drive right by if you weren't looking for it.  It is definitely worth stopping in to eat here! There are lots of tables and could be good for a large group of people.  Wish I lived in town cuz I would frequent this place often!"}
{"text":"The food is great!
But the service was slow, our entrees were served one at a time. If the first person had started their entree when it was served, they would have been finished by the time the last person was served... However, with that said... all of our entrees were delicious. 
The spring rolls were fresh with a sweet dipping sauce. Tom Yum soup, fresh lemon taste. For the soup, ordered the heat at a 5 out of 10 and there was some definite heat... 
No complaints on the chow main or orange chicken. 
One of the best entrees sampled was the Chicken Curry- pieces of chicken breast sauteed and stirred into light curry coconut sauce. 
Found out you can also order online and delivered. 
I'll be back again, hopefully the service will improve."}
{"text":"Seriously best Thai food ever!!!! I've been coming here for 4 years I have not found a place as authentic as this one! They have the best beef pad see eww it takes a lil time but worth it! Just confirms that what they cook is made fresh at the moment! A must try when in vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch special for 7.99!
Choice of soup or salad!
Rice or fried rice !
Over 8 entrees for lunch to pick from!
I love the garlic pepper chicken!
You call your spicy level 1-4!
You get a ton of chicken for the money!
Always been 5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Panang Chicken!!! This stuff is to die for. Also, the satay with the peanut sause. My wife and I love this place."}
{"text":"I ordered the Panang chicken which comes with a watery type broth that most people don't know you are supposed to dump your bowl of rice into to absorb it all . But anyways, it was good. I had a Thai Iced Tea that was not the best I've ever had. Also, I was shocked to find there was no yellow curry chicken on the menu. Never had that happen ever before at a Thai restaurant. I even asked and she did not know what I was referring to. 

The kool thing about this restaurant though is you get one free refill on your Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"Pretty authentic Thai for North Scottsdale! Always get the Kom yom soup (sp*). Pretty good service and always busy during lunch hours which is a good sign :)"}
{"text":"Try the noodle soup it's wonderful. Small business and its cute. Pawn and al are adorable and welcoming. I'm not big on Thai food but this place is great. I like the option to change how spicy you can make any dish. most Thai places I have been to don't offer that."}
{"text":"Great food, fast, friendly service.  I've only tried the curry's but they were all wonderful.  Generous portions."}
{"text":"Don't let the bad reviews discourage you from trying this place! Absolutely love Thai House.   

This is our go-to delivery place, with some of the tastiest Thai food I've had in Vegas. We order food from this restaurant on a pretty regular basis and it's consistently delicious every time. 

Their yellow curry and Tom Kha are both rich and flavorful. Other favorites include pad kee mao, papaya salad and crunchy squid."}
{"text":"Simply put, I did not like this place. I came here for lunch on a weekday and while the service was good, do yourself a favor and try lunch elsewhere. The water tasted gross and the chicken was not tasty at all! I do not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is okay for Thai food. It's better than Thai Basil but not better than Yupha's Thai Kitchen. I wouldn't recommend anything sweet and sour. I had sweet and sour tofu, and the sauce had a really weird taste-- it tasted kind of like tomato sauce or something. The Pad Thai is pretty average. The portions are a good size for the money. I usually get two meals out of one dish."}
{"text":"I like coming here for lunch as they get lunch time. It's quick, service is pretty decent, the food is good, and the prices are more than fair for what you get portion size. 

I got the pad Thai and panang curry when I came on several occasions and it's good. It's executed to what I think properly and consistent. I like their egg drop soup and the crab rangoons are pretty good as well. I like the sauce that comes with the crab rangoons. 

The location is close to work and I can get in and out quick. The place is small and isn't really for large groups. Lunch is usually pumped in there and busy. It's really weird standing and everyone seems to stare at you when you are waiting. Bro, just eat your food faster so I can sit. 

I do wish the service washer personable but I am not expecting a 5 star service from here. But just order takers don't excite me much. 

Overall great place for lunch. I wouldn't personally go for dinner unless I was alone. Lunch game do it. Great spot for quick lunch and good food."}
{"text":"This is a similar review to my other experience at the other location. Holy smokes these guy here are fast. The service was way better and they checked in on me often. More spacious location.  I'm glad it's consistent between locations. I'm a fan.

{"text":"Cheap, fast and delicious! Really good lunch menu, lots of options and big portions.  If you like Thai curries, you'll like all the options here. Also they'll make anything with tofu (fried). Good option for vegans or vegetarians."}
{"text":"Been ordering Delivery lately because of my laziness. Lol. Love the food here. They have a lot of menu options here. Will be ordering here more often."}
{"text":"This restaurant has one major problem:  it is too far from my house.

Today is Mother's Day, and the family decided they wanted take-out Thai food.  Our neighborhood Thai restaurant is closed on Sundays so we were trying to find a nearby restaurant to substitute for our old standby.  My daughter volunteered to drive 25 minutes to Thai House and 25 minutes back because she said this was an awesome restaurant.  Since she was driving, I didn't argue.

She brought back just two dishes, Pad Thai noodles and a red curry over rice dish.  I have had similar dishes over the years, but this was selection was AWESOME.  The portions were generous, the prices were reasonable, and flavors were perfect.  I am hooked.

The problem is that I live 25 minutes away.  I might have to call a realtor to see if I can somehow move within walking distance of Thai House.  We are definitely ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I stopped by only for dessert and ordered the sweet rice with mango. I brought home 3 orders and everyone LOVED them. Great portions for the price. Typically when I have ordered this dish at other Thai restaurants they give a sample size for the same price, so when I opened our to go box we were all happy campers and devoured them."}
{"text":"Love Thai house! Huge portions, good prices, good food. Always order the orange chicken and am never disappointed! Recommend for dining in or carry out."}
{"text":"The closest and most favored thai restaurant close to the house.

The thai ice tea is large = 0)

The staff is very attentive!

They have great entertainment (my cousin hired the entertainer for a party..he was great = 0).  Listen to music and eat.

They have thai and chinese food.  I haven't had any complaints on any dishes.  

The restaurant is clean and nicely decorated.  A great place for large parties.  

I got them listed on my phone.  Love calling in carry out orders!"}
{"text":"The food is spicy- which is hard to find in this valley- but there's always flies buzzing around?"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Thai house for about 4 years I believe and I think they've changed cooks. 

I used to order pad Thai from them all the time and the past two times I went, it was really gross. Noodles weren't cooked all the way and they loaded way too much sauce so it was overly sour and salty. It surprised me because last year I ordered a party platter of the pad Thai for a party and it was amazing. 


Stay away from the pad Thai, but the pad see ew and chicken lahb is always good and so is there curry! However, make sure you specify the spice level. I ordered a no spiced curry once and it tasted like a 5!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I get the feeling that there's a team of Thai grandmothers in the kitchen doing the cooking.  It's that good. From the curries to pad Thai to the salads, I've never gone wrong. It tells you something when this casual spot is absolutely packed on a Tuesday night for dinner."}
{"text":"I would like to say that we were able to review the food, but seeing as we waited an over an hour & a half for our food to be delivered, called about it, & was argued with over whether we had ordered or not when we received an e-mail confirmation, I don't even want to try this place's food."}
{"text":"Did a Yelp search for a restaurant in the area where we were at and we came across this place because Thai food sounded good (even though it was over 100 degrees). I ordered the spicy beef salad and the green papaya salad.  It was probably the best Thai salads that I have ever eaten.  Both salads had the perfect balance of sweet, sour, salty and spicy.  The service was great and you can tell it was family owned.  When I need to go to AZ again, I want to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I had the vegetable green curry. Very delicious. Delivery was not bad. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"I've been going here for over two years,  always for lunch.  It takes a while to receive your food but once we get it,  it's always great.  I always opt for the moo goo gai pan.  I don't like my veggies overcooked,  but more crispy.  They do a good job of that.  A tad bit pricy but the decor is very nice compared to similar restaurants."}
{"text":"I won't 'star' this review yet. I ordered online today (12/22/11) and it's been over an hour and the food isn't here. It was supposed to be delivered by 12:30 and it's after 1 right now. They did call to tell me brown rice costs a dollar more per order which wasn't reflected on the site. 
Already we're off to a bad start but I will eat with an open mind. Be back eventually after lunch.
K, back. The food was good but no where near warm enough to fully enjoy. I ordered the Panang Chicken very spicy and it barely was. They also screwed up some parts of the order. I figured they were busy because of a lunch rush, but if you can't get the online ordering down pat, remove it as an option. Seriously, an extra goddam dollor for a penny's worth of brown rice? I won't be back, sorry Thai house."}
{"text":"Delicious food, excellent service & a clean restaurant, that's why this place filled up so quickly on a Friday evening soon after we went in! It was recommended by a colleague at work but I never had the chance to try it until then. 

It was 4 of us at around 5:30pm. The restaurant is kinda small but is nice and looks new. It was about a third full when we got there. We were quickly seated and asked for our drinks. 

We ordered 2 orders of yellow curry chicken, 1 mild and 1 spicy at level 3. We also ordered a chicken chowmein and a beef pad see ew medium spice. 

The yellow curry was great! I ordered it mild and it was just a light level of spice. I tried a bite of the pad see ew and it was good as well with lots of meat! My curry also had lots of chicken. They are very generous on the protein. 

Prices were good and portions were pretty big, we took a lot of the food home. 

They have lunch deals for around $7.99. Since this location is close to my office, I'll probably be showing up here quite often! Great recommendation!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars for Thai house. 

Don't get me wrong, their food is amazing, and their curries are pretty close to unique Thai. And I love them spicy. However, when upon ordering you're asked how hot you want your curry (on a scale of 1 being the lowest and 5 being the hottest), it usually never comes out the way you except it. 

Like I said, their curries are amazing. I've had the red, yellow, and green curries and they've never disappointed. Green is probably my favorite between them all. 

They also have a vegetable house soup which is absolutely delicious, light, and flavorful. I would recommend it.

However, one time I ordered the curry noodles. The noodles were so overcooked that they pretty much congealed together and it was near impossible to pick them up, let alone distinguish noodle to noodle when it came to eating the \"paste\"

Also their service is somewhat snooty and rude, and doesn't pay much attention to you or your questions."}
{"text":"I've been to the Thai house on Shea and Scottsdale, and to be honest I prefer this location simply because it's not so depressing. 

I came here for lunch with my boyfriend one day. The place gets PACKED at lunch- both weekdays and weekends, so make sure to plan accordingly. Anyhow, we were lucky enough to be seated immediately. We ordered two Diet Cokes to start, and they came out and tasted funny- almost a little like soapy chemicals (possibly from not being completely rinsed after being washed??). Looking in the glasses, we notices bubbly foam on top of the drinks themselves. The server took them back and gave them to the busser lady, which right behind the counter, she poured them out and rinsed the glasses with the water from the soda fountain and then refilled. Not my idea of cleaning the glass or providing us with new ones, but whatever.  to be honest, they still tasted like soap for the rest of the meal. 

Anyhow, we ordered the Panang Curry and the Pad Thai for entrees as well as some soups to start. The soups were really really good. I got the vegetable soup and it was fresh, light, and the vegetables were of decent quality. My boyfriend got the coconut milk soup, which I didn't enjoy as much but was still pretty good. 

The main dishes came out in a decent amount of time. The Pad Thai (on a 4/5 hotness scale) was done really well. It had a decent amount of chicken in it, and the spicyness level was pretty accurate to what we ordered. 

The curry was also pretty good. The vegetables (at least the carrots) I'm pretty sure come frozen and they add to the curry, but they're not bad. The curry overall is flavorful and has a decent amount of kick to it. My only complaint here about the food is that they don't give much rice with the curry dishes. 

There was one server for the whole restaurant, one food runner and one busser. This seemed a little odd as it was extremely busy, but oh well. It made the service a bit subpar. 

This Thai house restaurant location possibly would have gotten a higher rating if we werent served soap on the rocks. The food, however was really good."}
{"text":"Very nice place to go for an authentic Thai experience. They even have a performance on the last Friday of every month. Price is reasonable. Food is authentic. No MSG. Will go again."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at Panda Express but my last visit made me think that this must be a similar dining experience.  I went to Thai House for the 2nd time in a few years and now I remember why I didn't go back after my first visit:  there was no reason for me to return.  

Ordered their so-called house specialty:  charbroiled chicken and was expecting something more along the lines of a traditional Gai Yang or a marinated/spiced bbq chicken.  Instead what I got was a dry, dry, dry, and more dry pieces of thigh and leg pieces with a superficial coating of curry.  bleh.  On top of that the soup was cold and tasteless.

The Boston Market across the 101 or even a KFC would've probably had better chicken.  I guess I'll have to make the 45+ minute trip to Glendale or the Southeast Valley for better Thai food in the area..."}
{"text":"Thai house is our go to spot for 5 years. Every friend we introduce it to is hooked. They have a great friendly staff and delivery is always quick. Definitely get the Chicken Chili Mint (tends be be spicier that usual ) and the Vege Penang Curry!!"}
{"text":"Good food, but I think they are lying about not using MSG in their foods. MSG makes you very thirsty... But be warned ask for a 10 in spicy, and you might get a 3, ask for a 2 and you get a 9. Very unreliable. They do have great delivery man who will make your order right when they get it wrong, which is often! Overall this is probably the best Thai food in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant--as well as the FLW location. We moved to Phoenix about four years ago and it took us a good two years, eight Thai restaurants to find one we love. We always order #33 mussamum and 34 gang gai and they are the best I have had anywhere. The staff is always friendly. The only negative is that at this location they have a waterfall that drives us crazy because it's so loud in the dining room so we always get takeout :)"}
{"text":"In the mood for Thai, and saw the good ratings. Drove over and saw that it was crowded. Always a good sign.
We started out with the chicken satay. Amazing peanut sauce.
Our main dishes:
1) Pad Thai with chicken and some added broccoli. Excellent flavor. A big hit. 
2) Red curry with chicken.  Wow, another winner. 
In summary, a great restaurant with excellent food and big portions.
Spicy Basil. Excellent."}
{"text":"Great red curry with chicken, papaya salad, and pad se ew (thin, wide stir fried rice noodles).  Authentic flavors cooked up and ready for takeout in 25 minutes; just in time for that Thrones marathon.  Level 2 hotness is my jam."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch special curry to go & as usual food was perfect & hit the spot...I was close to Buddha Thai bistro an hour ago & wanted to give them a try & dined in & ordered curry which chicken was rubbery & potatoes tasted weird. Should've came tito Thai house in the 1st place"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered the house appetizers and two orders of combination pad thai. The appetizer plate was delicious! The pad thai may have been better if our order wasn't messed up and the delivery driver didn't have to go back to the restaurant, grab the right order and come back (whixh took an hour!!).. The pad thai was not what I expected. There was barely any meat and just tons of noodles that were poorly made because they stuck together so badly.. Needless to say, I will not be ordering from this place again! Very unsatisfied with the service and the food."}
{"text":"I was craving some Pad Thai and I had passed by the Thai House on numerous occasions but never stopped so on a whim I decided to give it a try. I am so happy that I did. I ordered take out and it took about 6 mins total from the time I ordered my food to the time I was walking out of the door. (Yes that quick)  I got home and devoured as much of the Pad Thai as I could which doesn't say much as I have over half of it left. Lots of food for a small price and the Pad Thai was really good. I ended up getting #4 spice on the side to add  to it and it made it even better.  (Their spices range from 0 to 5) I will definitely be going back to try their other menu items. If you are interested in some good Thai food on a budget, definitely try out the Thai House as I doubt you will leave hungry or disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent! I have found my favorite Thai Food Restaurant! I had the Lunch Special, Panang, steamed rice and soup. Everything was delicious. Even though it was very busy, the service was good and we didn't have to wait long to get our food served. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and what a great find!  Had the lemongrass tilapia which was a wonderfully prepared dish, very tasty and fresh.  The Combination Thai Fried Rice is very good. The Red Thai Curry is DYNOMITE! Very good flavors put over steamed white rice make this a unique flavored dish.  The Cashew Chicken was a very good mix of sauce and spices.  Try this place.  You will be hooked!"}
{"text":"We had pad see ew and a whole roasted chicken for two people. The chicken was well-seasoned. The price was right, and the food was pretty good. The staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot.  Chicken pad Thai lunch special comes with soup or salad.  And yummy Thai tea.  Get there early or order to go, pretty small and gets very bust for lunch."}
{"text":"Our favorite thai place. Great food. The delivery is fast too. Favorites are their fried rice, Tom kha soup, curry and it is all delicious."}
{"text":"Watched 3 employees debate with a take out customer that he placed the wrong order,  not that they got it wrong.  Then, they forgot to make my order so the rest of our tables food got cold while waiting for mine. While the food is good they need to work on service."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Vegas! This place is always crowded too, great sign. I absolutely love it here. I always try new places, but end up comparing them to Thai House. Others always fall short. 

My favorites here are the White Cabbage Soup that comes with napa , glass noodles with chicken or pork & green onions. Both chicken and pork are great. It's a super flavorful light soup. 

I always order the Fresh Rolls. They're big and filled with vegetables, fried tofu & seasoned glass noodles with sweet chili peanut sauce. They're even better the next day. 

The Satay and beef jerky are also great. So many yummy menu items! 

I've tried all of the curries, I definitely like the Masaman Curry the best! It's the one with curry paste, coconut milk, potato & peanuts. It's good with any protein but I opt for the fried tofu. Another dish that's even better the next day!

Favorite noodle dish is Pad Kee Mao, I love the flat noodles. The spice is always on point here and CONSISTENT! Love that! 

Ohh get sticky rice! Sticky rice is fun. It's even fun to say! 
Who doesn't love sticky food?! 

Bonus!! You get two free fried egg rolls when you spend more than $25 on a take out or delivery order. So basically, I get free egg rolls every single time lol.

Happy Yelping"}
{"text":"The decor is cool it makes you feel like your in Thai land. They have great lunch specials as well. I thought the food was average though."}
{"text":"A wonderful Thai dining gem for the Phoenix metro area. Gracious and welcoming wait staff. Consistently reliable excellent Thai cuisine. Be sure to try the duck curry, the panang curry with beef, the pad thai, and the tom kha gai soup. Oh, and don't forget to grab a delicious Thai iced tea to quench your thirst!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 entrees, This is not the first time we ordered from here and when we get home with the food both the orders are WRONG! When we called to tell them they said well what do you want? They were rude and not accommodating. We go back there and then when we get there they give the wrong order again! The guy at the desk was rude and arguing with my husband and the worst part after this 2 hour ordeal is that they charged us for food that we did not even get UGH! NEVER going back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped at Best Buy and ended up stopping here for dinner.  Not much of an atomosphere, but were were very impressed with the food. The Red Curry chicken was excellent, as well as the Pad Thai.  We'll def be returning.   The only negative is the bathroom is pretty rough - some attention to it could make a big difference to the overall feel of the place."}
{"text":"The curries at the Thai House are fantastic.  The vegetables are fresh, tofu is good, and meat quality is okay (I don't eat meat often but my husband (who does) gave this assessment).  We have dined in the restaurant several times but order take out 1-2 times a month.  The only area for improvement is that sometimes my meal is not spicy enough.  I find I need to order a high number of stars than the normal Thai restaurant.  Overall, a good option for Thai food."}
{"text":"Thai House Restaurant is also located in the Smiths shopping center on the southeast corner of Maryland Parkway and Silverado Ranch. 

After taking care of our business at the UPS store, we decided to grab a bite to eat, and since all 4 of us like us some Thai food, we decided to give this place a try. The place was a trip lol. The place had some cool asian decor in it, but their were light fixtures that had cobwebs and dust hanging off of them. That was a bit off putting.

I went as a memeber of a party of four. I ordered the combo fried rice plate. It was kind of awkward that everybody else recieved their food about 10 minutes before I recieved mine. This was a little annoying, but not a deal breaker. When I did recieve my food it was very good! The shrimp was especially tasty and the pork was also nice and juicy! 

Two of the friends I went with are Thai and had a little portion of everyones plate, just to check it out, and he said that the food was just \"ok\" and that the fried rice combo plate was by far the best of all four of ours. I guess I got lucky!

I guess my biggest complaint is that the service was so sllllloooooowwwwww. OMG. Like I said, it was annoying that everyone was eating and I sat there for almost 10 more minutes waiting to get my food. The lady who was our server was nice and was very good about refilling our drinks.

All in all, it wasn't bad, but I've certainly experienced better.Maybe I'll be back one day since one of my friends loves his place, but I won't be going out of my way apart from that.

3 stars."}
{"text":"I give this a 5 star because their Thai Iced Tea is the BEST!!!!!

I came to visit my sister and her family and she introduced me to it. She says she always goes and gets the tea there. You can't beat the $3.24 like 64 oz container that they put it in. You get what it's worth if you tell them not to put too much ice. Then you'll get more of the tea than just ice. This is the best. I wish there was one like it here in Seattle."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is decent, however the staff (including the people that own the restaurant) are horrible. I have ordered food for delivery MANY times and the online service says it will take 45 min to a hour which is fine but I have never received it in less than an hour and a half! So I usually accommodate for this and order way before I am hungry, tonight I ordered food at 5:15 and it was not delivered to my house until 7:38. When I called the first time to ask where my food was the woman that answered was very rude and told me she would figure it out then she hung up on me! I called again 10 min later (which was around 7:20) and asked to speak to the owner, the owner then said she was sorry and would call the driver and then in turn hung up on me! So these people had the nerve to hang up on a paying customer twice! They also did not offer me anything, no discounts or money back for bringing my food hours late. This is the only thai place in my area that delivers but honestly I would rather drive to the other end of the city and eat before I ordered here again."}
{"text":"Good food (best Tum Yum if you like acidity), Meh Service

I've been coming here since 2006, but this is the first time I've reviewed it.  I generally love getting the Tum Yum (with shrimp) (I ordered this at I Am Thai, and it was so sweet and terrible, so I only get it here now) and the beef jerky when I come here.  The menu has spelling errors all over it, but that is part of the charm.  The service is usually bad, especially if you get the older female, but it is not entirely terrible.  You just might get ignored or it might take awhile before you get served.  However, given the price point and the quality of the food, it is very good.

My wife likes to order the curry dishes here.  They are good, although nothing special and similar to what you can get at the other Thai places in the neighborhood (although not as good as Lotus with its specialty Northern Thai dishes, Arawan is also excellent).   We also tried the pad see ew, which was okay (I like Le Thai's better, also its awesome noodles).  

Anyway, five stars for the Tum Yum Soup and the beef jerky.  3 stars for the service.  The singers were annoying at first, but now it is part of the charm."}
{"text":"THAI HOUSE IS QUITE POSSIBLY THE BEST THAI FOOD IVE EVER HAD!!  The flavors of all the dishes I sampled blew my brains, and the cost to quality was insane, which means the food quality is excellent and the price is insanely cheap.  They must get a lot of business otherwise I cant see how they can make any money turning out this amazing food at such a low cost.  I went with 2 of my friends and we split 3 items, we got the Chicken Panang, Beef Pra-Ram and the orange chicken.  Now before you judge about the orange chicken, F U it was amazing this isn't panda express this is high quality deep fried and battered chicken! HAHA but really its excellent (mainly the sauce) for what it is which is what I just said.  The Panang which should be ordered anytime upon entering a Thai restaurant was the best I've never had and the Beef Pra-Ram hidden on the back on the menu was like nothing I've ever had.  It was in a delicious peanut sauce that I wanted to pour all over my body and use in the lovemaking process OVERALL A+ AMAZING RESTAURANT!!!

P.S. the good for kids part, I would say yes as far as the setting but I don't know a lot of kids who like Thai food.

ALSO the $$ is for dinner, $ for lunch, mad cheap, mad delicious, GO!"}
{"text":"With my limited food options in the burbs I decided to give this place another try. So glad I did! The shrimp was of a much better quality this time. Very solid meal.  I would give this place 3 1/2 stars if I could."}
{"text":"I just found my new favorite Thai food restaurant. Staff is ultra friendly and the food is pretty good. Tonight I had a delicious spicy beef salad, loaded with veggies and a generous amount of beef.
I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Great place for Thai food. Spring rolls were crispy with fresh vegetables.  They have a special big bowl of Tum Yum soup for only 5 dollars. Pad Thai was enormous with plenty of chicken onions and fresh vegetables. I will be returning  soon."}
{"text":"It's just fair. Yellow curry bland and a bit watery. Mixed vegetables with chicken was good not great, their chicken is tough.
Beef salad...meh.
Won't go back....rather drive to Totties for really great Thai!"}
{"text":"Food ok. Looking for more traditional Thai food just like Thai town in California. Keep looking. :("}
{"text":"Food is amazing. It takes a few times of calling before they answer but it is worth it! This restaurant is also so close to me so thats always a benefit! They are always so busy. Again, the food is great. What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Thai Tuesday started all right. The AC was working on this blistering sunny day and we had waters served. We ordered our food and we had it come out in 7 minutes. Not bad, the food was hot. The rice was good and the soy sauce didn't taste like Kikkoman. I ordered the spicy chicken at spice level 4/5. The first bite of chicken tasted like plain chicken,  I didn't really get a sauce flavor. It was also not spicy. I took some more bites and everything was temperature hot but I assume they had the chicken and vegetables premade and then heated it all up in a wok before it came out. I had a voracious appetite so I kept eating it. I had to use an unusual amount of soy sauce and chili paste to make the chicken palatable, though. I stopped myself about 83% through because I was sodium-ed out and the taste was getting unbearable. We received the check and I glanced over at the counter and saw a roach creepy crawling over the place. I told the hostess and she immediately squashed it, but I'm not sure if she washed her hands after that. Of course my stomach started hurting shortly after that, whether psychosomatic or not...there is one thing that is true and that is that there is NEVER just ONE cockroach."}
{"text":"Got the spicy rice dish with beef. Got level 3 of 5 in spice and it was just right. Perfect spice without overdoing it. Def gonna go back!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to Thai restaurant. Dine in, take out or delivery. Love all of the curries. They have no problem accommodating requests (I prefer no potatoes and substitute mixed vegetables in yellow curry) service is excellent. Delivery is 45-60 min. They follow your requested spice level -I prefer it Hot and go with a 5, my husband likes a 1. Never disappointed! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We stopped and grabbed Thai food here before our flight went out. I tasted my friends order of the yellow curry which was very good! I had the pad Thai with chicken, level two. The spiciness was perfect but I think the pad Thai noodles needed to be cooked just a little bit longer. They were much chewier than I'm used to. Decent prices, great portions."}
{"text":"Thai House is my go-to place when it comes to Thai food. First and foremost, their customer service here is amazing. The servers are always friendly and they never rush you into ordering. They're also great when it comes to suggestions on new dishes to try. Second, their food is great quality! I always get their Thai House Fried Rice, just like their pad Thai. My favorite here though is their Panang curry/Salmon Panang, it is just so perfect. Definitely worth checking out if you like Thai food, and their prices won't break your bank either."}
{"text":"I agree with D.T from Scottsdale. My husband and I have ordered take out from this place several times. They CANNOT get the order correct. I know, I know, why do we keep trying? We like their food and I guess we're gluttons for punishment. One time they gave us a completely different order. Another time they forgot the side order of rice. Tonight we ordered a dish with chicken and it came with beef. This isn't rocket science folks. Just double check the take out order with the receipt. Be for warned! DOUBLE CHECK YOUR TAKE OUT ORDER BEFORE GOING HOME!"}
{"text":"I've tried many Thai restaurants in Vegas and this one by far is my favorite! Everything on their menu is outstanding. Our go-to dishes are the Curry's, Pad Thai, Chili Mint Meat and Fresh Rol"}
{"text":"Great Little Thai dive. This is my go to place. Very small though. If they are busy I just order to go."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai dishes. I've tried 50% of this menu. I've been a long time customer ((10 years)). I was surprised by some of the negative reviews about the slow service, but I'm usually getting takeout & they have never been late or screwed up my order!

The soups are my favorite! I've never had better Tom Yum than what they serve here. My second favorites are the spicy beef salad (I get it as a 7) and the papaya salad.
Pad Thai is awesome as well.

They offer Chinese dishes too & my fave is the house fried rice. Pineapple !! Yum..

I enjoy the Taro milk tea with boba. It comes with crushed ice instead of cubes & I dig it. 
My friends all rave about the Thai tea as well."}
{"text":"No surprises here. They serve typical Thai food for a reasonable price. The lunch menu (M-F) has huge portions for about $10. 

Service was fast and friendly. No complaints."}
{"text":"We were in over a very busy Friday lunch hour. The pad Thai was great, but the red curry really was a standout dish. So excellent! Highly recommend this as a place for great prices and outstanding food-don't judge based on its strip mall location!"}
{"text":"The Tom Kha was DELICIOUS but the pad see ew with beef was just ok.  Will definitely come back for the Tom Kha!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  A client recommended lunch here today, and it was enjoyed by all.  We each ordered a dish and shared amongst the group.  Some of the portions are a little on the small side (but for some reason we got a giant helping of pad thai) .  I would definitely like to see more food for the price we paid.  But I got to try some new dishes and will definitely be back for more.  I recommend the Tom Khad Kai (coconut soup), green papaya salad, Crying Tiger (spicy beef tenderloin), and the golden basa filet."}
{"text":"I got the spicy fried rice with chicken and my gf got the pad Thai. The spicy fried was REALLY good and the pad was not bad. 

Will come back!"}
{"text":"Although it is hard to get through on the phone when they are busy, it's worth the effort. This place is awesome! The food never disappoints and the staff is always nice. I usually get take out to stuff my face alone, not because I don't like the dining area. All in all, this is my favorite Thai in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you like horrible Panang curry this is the place for you. Tasted like it was poured from a can and reheated on a stove."}
{"text":"Thai House is my absolute fave for Thai. I always get the Red Curry with Jasmine rice as it's the healthiest item on the menu. I wouldn't consider this a health food obviously but it is coconut milk based and at least a healthy calorie along with the not so awesome high calorie part. It comes to $11 and change for a meal and it's 2 generous servings. You can get a spice level of 1-5 and I just get a 1 or 2 as I don't care for spicy. I'm always surprised with how quickly they prepare take out orders as they are packed every time I stop in to pick up. I've tried all of the Thai spots in North Scottsdale and this is now the only one I will go to. Delish!"}
{"text":"This would've been a 5 star as we really enjoyed eating here at least once a week and the food is great. However a few days ago we were in the car heading there because our 3yrs old was craving the noodles and it was 8:15pm we called to make sure we weren't missing the last order as we were 20mins away. The lady on the phone said last order is at 8:30, I would have loved if they allowed us to order on the phone at 8:30 since we were arriving shortly after we also offered to provide our cc details but they weren't flexible and that was disappointing hence the 3 star. Thankfully we ended up trying another Thai restaurant that also happens to be much closer to our home and very delicious."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking good I always order from eat24... Where else can you get pho and tom yum and all diff curries from the same place??? This one! They always deliver so quickly too! Chicken satays are marinated in coconut milk."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! The portions were gigantic (but I was hungry and ate everything ) and filling. The biggest thing for me was the customer service...everyone was super nice, explained the heat scale for which their restaurant uses. I even asked for extra sauce that was used on my entree, and no problem, they brought it out and didn't even charge extra like some places do. 

I forgot the names of the plates my friend and I ordered, but I feel you cannot go wrong with anything you decide to order. The food was flavorful, had the right amount of spice, and I loved the sauces. Next time I'm on this side of town, I'll definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Always yummy Thai food - Pad Thai, curries, Kung Pao, spicy eggplant - all delicious. The prices are reasonable, especially considering the generous portions. 

The service can be a bit on the slow side if you come at a busy time (noon, 6:30pm), but they're always nice. 

I used to go to their Frank Lloyd Wright & 101 location, and this one is much nicer inside."}
{"text":"Probably hands down a favorite for my North Scottsdale Thai fix. Love the Tom ka, & I usually get the spicy chicken or the spicy basil."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and each time has been the same. Great service, but so-so food. The last time I went here was for dinner on a Friday night, and to my surprise, they busted out the karaoke machine during dinner. While I'm all for karaoke, when I'm trying to have a conversation with my friends, I'd prefer if I didn't have off-tune singing in the background. A good idea to bring more fun to dining, for sure, but as the night progressed, I couldn't handle the singing anymore. Maybe if the singing had been better...

Anyways, this time around, my friend and I ordered the Wonton Soup in a Hot Pot ($7.95)- BBQ pork, vegetables & wontons in a clear soup. I was disappointed when the soup arrived, as it was served in a large bowl, not a hot pot, making for a less than steaming hot soup after a while. I enjoyed the BBQ pork slices and the bok choy in the soup, but the soup itself and the wontons in the soup were too sweet. Needless to say, we didn't finish our big bowl of soup. 

In past visits, I've tried:
Tom Yum Soup- too sour
Green Curry- too sweet
Thai BBQ Chicken- large portion, but the chicken was too dry

Maybe I need better luck next time when choosing what I should eat at Thai House, but the dishes I've tried so far have not been amazing. But what has been amazing is the service. I went for a birthday party once, and the servers brought out plates and utensils for the cake that we brought from outside free of charge. Talk about accommodating! All the servers are so nice and sweet that it's hard to not come back to give their food another try."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  

Really liked the pad-Thai and Tom ghi soup.  

But don't get the chicken teriyaki.  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I haven't found Thai food here in AZ quite as good as other places but I do really enjoy Thai House. While the decor and ambiance are not very inviting, the staff is always kind, the food arrives timely and it is always delicious. I come here very often and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Coconut boba is amazing!  Love the curry!  Service takes quite a while if you are looking for a quick lunch you may be crunched for time.  Worth the wait in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Service can be minimal and seating is limited. Lunch is always busy, but the food and value is worth it. Try the garlic pepper chicken or the panang."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Thai restaurants in the local area.  Service is pretty good, staff is friendly and welcoming.  I usually order the eggplant mint dish with sliced beef at a spice level 8/10 and it always hits the spot.   Reasonably priced and filling portions.  
I have ordered delivery before and their service is on par too."}
{"text":"I have to give them 4 stars strictly on portion size alone. I always order to go and end up eating it on my couch, so I can't speak on behalf of the service. I will say that I had the Panang Chicken and it was really good and moderately priced. I highly recommend for a Thai food fix."}
{"text":"The Thai House rocks! Your portions are awesome and the food is very reasonable. I had the Kung Poa Chicken last time and it FN rocked! What grabbed me the most is that they char roasted the chilies and it added and amazing flavor to the dish. In fact, this is the best Kung Poa Chicken that I have ever had.

Lunch comes with some killer Egg Drop soup. Here's the deal, the best part about this restaurant are the staff. They are so accommodating to your needs; every single one of them are super helpful. Then menu has all of your traditional fare that you Chinese food lovers crave. This small hidden away gem is always crowded. So, if you are heading for lunch, get there about 11:00 to 11:15.

This restaurant is located in a great strip mall that has tons of shopping and is a stones throw from the largest Harley Davidson dealer in the United States. That alone is worth the trip as you can spend several hours there easily. There are coffee houses and cool bars as well. Oh and don't forget the micro brewery too. This is one of my favorite stops when I'm in the neighborhood. Check them out if your around!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was mediocre at best. 
Service was slow. 
Too many others that do it better to come back."}
{"text":"I work in the area and love this place. They give huge portions so it's a bang for its buck."}
{"text":"First time here.. over priced/overdone
I ordered orange chicken medium spicy... the chicken was so overcooked it was like trying to eat jerky strings
Then I got Pad see u
was supposed to be #4 spicy and was not even warm.... the chicken was so over cooked & hard I could not even chew it...
pretty disappointed in this place... specially being in Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Not so service... It's not bad for take out, but the service has consistently been awkward and slow. Not very responsive and they don't always seem to know what they are doing. Plus, communication is sometimes difficult. The food is the only saving grace, but just know that the spice-level rating is inconsistent. Don't give a number, just tell them how you like it.

Tables tend to wobble and the live music initially was cheesy-charming, but after a while, it's just cheesy. Needs to be saved by Irwin (restaurant impossible)!"}
{"text":"This place legit has the best Thai food in the area. I got a little bummed out with them for New Years when my order got messed up but really they are pretty consistent with providing a top-notch quality grub here. The Spicy Thai basil, Pannang  curry & BBQ fried rice are all amazing and you won't be disappointed with any of those dishes."}
{"text":"Really like this place for dependable Thai, although I almost always order the spicy noodles.  It's fairly spicy at 3 (out of 5), but not crazy hot.  I have also gotten the Tom Yum soup- it's good but really pricy for the size (although it's filled with a ton of shrimp).  Word of caution- this place gets packed at lunch time and it's not very big, so be sure to get in early. Also, no alcohol.  I'll leave it up to you as to whether that's important or not..."}
{"text":"been coming here for years, place was never a let down for me, now that they do delivery is much more convenient for melol. i always order the beef red curry spicy level 4. and for dessert i get the fried banana's ooo yum yum."}
{"text":"They can NOT get take out orders correct at all.  The food we got was bland, no taste.  We have given them several tries thinking one or 2 times could be just a bad day.  Nope.....they can not.  I am done and will no longer try to go to these people.
And when you do dine with them, they are rude and abrupt.
Not the right place for good food or good service."}
{"text":"Pad See Ew is alright. I didn't quite like the minced up garlic, but it was good for flavoring. The inside of this palce is nicely decorated, spacious, and clean. I'll need to come back to this place to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Oh Thai House, you just get me!

My boyfriend and I recently just moved to St Rose and Eastern and have been trying every single Thai restaurant in the area. Every...single...one. Guess who wins! Thai House!!! Their curries are the dankest of all dank. The extra friendly staff makes us feel like regulars already. The Thai tea is on point. Nothing to complain about here!"}
{"text":"The service here is never quick but the food is always delicious, so I would say worth the wait. The chicken Panang & their Pad Thai are my favorites. Tried their red curry too. Not bad. I'm only a spice 2 type of girl but holy cow I tried a 5 and almost blew fire  caution on the hotness scale. The restaurant itself always is clean & busy. It's in a strip mall corner, so slightly hidden. I'm full & happy."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once every week since it's close to my office, and they are always quick, tasty and reasonably priced.   I usually get one of the lunch specials (even the Chinese-sounding dishes have a Thai flair, especially if you order them with extra spice), but if you're hungry the house special chicken is well worth the extra buck, as are the Thai noodle dishes (the pad see ew is my favorite).  

The wait staff is always friendly, the food is always quick, good and reasonably priced.  i haven't had a bad experience in several dozen visits, and i'll continue to call myself a regular."}
{"text":"Not the best service everyone seems to be grumpy but that being said, I will still continue to eat here because it's that good.  I'd rather place an order for pick up because the vibe in there is just grumps working.  

Amazing chicken & papaya salad is perfect light & refreshing"}
{"text":"Update:
This has actually become one of my favorite thai places.
The panang curry is much better than the green or red.  
Tom kha still not my favorite, but not bad.  Its cabbage, not lettuce in it.

My favorite part is the portion size.  Enough for at least 2 meals for a normal person.  Or share with a friend if you aren't super hungry."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. It's tucked way in the back of the Smith's shopping center on the corner of Silverado & Maryland. The decor is authentic, the food is American style but with some unique authentic twists. The service in-store is excellent. We've had the same waitress every time, she's hilarious! 

Tom Kha soup - insanely good. Hands down the best soup I've ever had in my life. You'll want to pour it all over yourself, it's just incredible. I get it at a level 5 out of 10. 

The only reason for a 4 rating vs 5 is because of their beef dishes - they taste strange to me, but take that with a grain of salt as I am not an avid red meat fan. 

Tom Kha soup. Seriously. Do it."}
{"text":"This place is bomb.com every week always having this place deliver me something hella good and fresh. I love this place and everything they make!"}
{"text":"Excellent & reasonably priced Thai food."}
{"text":"Mediocre Thai food. A little overpriced for the quality of food and portion size though. Ordered for delivery multiple times and always had something missing or wrong."}
{"text":"delicious food, very nice service...we had the panang curry and fried shrimp, green tea, jasmine rice...it was delicious"}
{"text":"Whoops, I forgot the name to this place and reviewed it under \"Thai Hut.\" There goes my only first review!  Here is my old review:

Wow, this place is great! It is a small diner-ish place in a shopping center, but the service was good and the food was great! 

I was starving when we came here for lunch after a morning of shopping for cars (ugh). I ordered the yellow curry noodles (a dish I've never seen at a Thai place but ordered on a whim), 3 out of 5 spicy; my boyfriend ordered panang curry 5 stars spicy on the lunch special (comes with soup and rice). Both were great, although he said his could be spicier (3 out of 5 was a good medium spice for me). After mediocre Thai restaurants in Tempe, I was pleasantly surprised with this place. Too bad it is so far away! Best Thai food I've had in Phoenix area so far ..."}
{"text":"The food was very good. My wife and I ordered the combination fried rice and two orders of the Thai style sausage. We were satisfied. Very filling. I plan on coming back soon."}
{"text":"The reason it even got a 2 is because of the service. It was good service. The food on the other hand is bad.... I have been to many Thai places and this one was the only bad Thai food place I've had."}
{"text":"Very good food I'm first time here with my brother he like tai shop we came here and try there shop it's was very good and the service was good we will come again"}
{"text":"Been around 6 times so far; still the best I've found in the area though that's not saying much (having visited Thailand and lived in the Bay Area!).  The vegetable dishes are great, and the spicy catfish is awesome (it's a 'special' but seems to be on the board all the time).  The larb gai (chicken salaid) is good too,though they serve too much chicken in my opinion on a small plate (you need to get at the lemon juice at the bottom, which is hard with a small plate piled high).  

The big disappointment so far is the curries. They have about 6 curries, and each one comes with a choice of meat (or prawn/tofu). Now, if you've had authentic Thai curries like Massaman, it will come with tender cubes of beef, which are soaked through with the flavor and fall apart with the fork. But here, because they offer 'mix and match' \"Meats\", they simply dump in the pre-cooked meat and cook for a few minutes. My beef curry therefore consisted of thin slices/pieces of beef, which completely misses the point of the curry. I recommend they stop offering every curry in every combination, and get some real cubes of beef in there! 

But the place does good overall and sells beer (unlike their place at Pima/Frank Lloyd Wright), so I'll give them 4 stars!  Their 'Chang' beer is better in my opinion that Singha, which gives me a headache!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, great price - but no alcohol.  I asked if I could bring my own, they said no (not sure why not).  I love Thai food, but I also find that Thai food goes SO WELL with beer!  They should allow carry-in beer/wine then it would be 5 star!  Thai House on Shea (same owners, I think) does the same basic menu but also has beer/wine, so I've been going there instead."}
{"text":"One of the better asian restaurants in the north valley.  Building is not fancy nor is decor, but food is top notch."}
{"text":"100% recommended. Lunch specials are the best deal here: $6.95 for your entree, rice (steamed or fried), soup, an egg roll, and a potsticker. Thai iced tea is a must. And if you're looking for curry, this is the BEST IN TOWN!"}
{"text":"TOO crowded for me...I don't like touching elbows with people i dont know or having to scoot my chair in every time someone needed to pass by.  The service was good and quick...the food was to greasy for me... if you can deal with big crowds then you would like this place.
(3 stars because of the service and how quick they were to serve)"}
{"text":"Ate here last week for dinner with a friend and can't complain. It was busy and service was a little slow but the two girls running the floor were super nice and friendly and apologized for the long wait for the food. Again, no complaints! Food was amazing! I got the yellow curry and that shit tasted great!!!!! Also had the war wonton soup and that was amazing also. Will definitely be coming back! Also their thai iced teas are huge! Yessss!"}
{"text":"This place is good but I would say for take-out only, the service is so inconsistent that I cringe .not sure if the servers are even understanding you at times . Good go to place and they deliver as well"}
{"text":"Probably one of thee best Thai food places i've eaten so far! the sweet n sour chicken was crispy n sweet but not greasy which i found amazing!! the seafood soup altho i rarely if never eat sea food was Very tasty! mixed Vegatbles with fried tofu wes decent.

The Thai fried rice was very good! had a lasting impression on the flavor bcuz it also wasnt greasy or oily compared to places here in CA.

price was moderate for thai food but worth it. cups they use are big compared to other places that use tiny cups so thats a big plus too! 

im half thai n filipino if that helps u decide if this is a good place to try lol."}
{"text":"This is place is little bit far away from my office but is one of few places we go regularly with our colleagues. Nothing fancy but service is fast enough and have usual curries that you expect with Thai place. However spice level can be hit or miss and if you are late for lunch, it can get crowded. they do also have some of other Chinese/Asian stuff like Kung Pao."}
{"text":"Thanks to my beautiful wife i have become a huge fan of Thai food over the years...and this restaurant does not disappoint. The day we visited my wife had the Pad Thai and i had the Thai Fried Rice with Chicken. The use various levels by number (1-5, spicy to really, really, really spicy) Now be advised it may be a little difficult to see because the entrance to the place is actually in a little strip mall and it doesn't face Shea Blvd...even though the sign on the building does. If your coming down Scottsdale Rd...once you turn onto Shea Blvd...u will have to make a left turn at the first light you see and then a quick right into the mini strip mall. The restaurant sits right across from an apt. complex and it will be worth the effort once you have located the establishment. Eat, Drink and be Merry my friends."}
{"text":"The curry dishes were quite good for the price.  I had the mango curry with tofu.  Good size portion and I had some to take home.  Only wish brown rice was an option."}
{"text":"I ordered their Thai House Honey Wings, Pad Prik Chicken and Thai Lemonade. The wings were OK but I had not expected lettuce dipped in the Honey sauce with it. It did not go well with the wings and could have been mentioned in the menu. The Thai lemonade was delicious and worth trying. Pad Prik Chicken was a slight disappointment, mostly because I have had better at different Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"The pad Thai is still very good, but we have found some new things on the menu. The green papaya salad is the best. The spicy chicken wings are very good, but we get them half spicy. Full spicy is very hot.  Pon and Nit take good care of us. Will continue to eat here."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, they have the best curry anywhere! The service has always been very good combined with the cleanliness of the restaurant I give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I love red curry and was in the mood to try out a Thai place that wasn't Thai Basil, so I thought I would check out Thai House. It is a pretty small restaurant, the interior is very drab. However, I'm guessing a large portion of their business is take-out so that does not matter much! My sister and I went at about 4:30 pm on a Saturday and we were the only ones there which was surprising to me! had the whole place to ourselves.
I ordered red curry with tofu, and my sister ordered the veggie egg rolls with a side of rice noodles. My curry was not too bad, but not great. The tofu in it seemed a bit of tough and overcooked, and every once in a while I'd get a bite of vegetables that had a slightly soapy taste to it, but otherwise not bad. The spice and flavor was good. My sister's egg rolls were very tasty, she really liked them and I liked the bite I tried as well. She did not like the rice noodles much, and I'm not sure why. 
The service was not good, unfortunately. After two more customers came we were completely forgotten about. They did not check on us once even after we made eye contact! Our waters never got refilled, which is rough when you are enjoying spicy food! Also I had to walk up and ask her for our check because she never gave it to us. She was just standing at the counter doing nothing. Thought that was a little ridiculous, especially since there were very few customers. Would have given the service two stars, but the egg rolls were good and the curry was mostly good, I think they deserve three.
I would come back out of convenience, but I was not too impressed with Thai House. If I return it would probably just be for take-out, because the service was pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! First time here. Ordered the panang curry with chicken to go. The portion was huge!! The flavor was amazing. I liked the venue as well, had a great place for a group. I was also informed they have music Wednesday and Fridays which is unique and I like that. I'll defiantly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Clearly don't know what they're doing, I took order to go, ordered steamed dumpling she gave me fried spring roll and she asked me if I can come back to return so she can recook it,I live 13 min away this is stupid. Never going here again"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with their Chicken Pad Thai, Red Curry Chicken, House Special Fried Rice (a bit of sweet and spice -as in flavorful party going on here) , Beef Salad, Tom Kha soup & potstickers & stuffed chicken wings for the kids."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food (especially the curry) for a reasonable price. Generous proportions, cozy atmosphere, but only adequate wait staff and cleanliness levels. It's not the staff or ambiance that keep me coming back, it's the really yummy, authentic food."}
{"text":"I wanted so badly for this to turn out to be a new favorite Thai place but, alas, it was not to be. I have very mixed feelings about Thai House.
Positive: Super friendly and helpful staff, busy, pleasant atmosphere, tantalizing smells, quick service.
Negative: THE BUG! After picking up my food and schlepping it all the way home, I opened my yellow curry to find a half inch BUG doing the backstroke on top. 
Positive: Returned all food uneaten to the restaurant, where polite and apologetic servers credited my card right away.
Negative: Not willing to risk it again, no matter how many diners rated it well on Yelp and how full the place was.
Sigh. I'll just have to continue on my quest for a new, close favorite Thai place. Sigh."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I was a little frustrated with my duck curry... but I think it may be my own fault for ordering it. I had duck bones everywhere, it was so much work. I had been at the pool all day so the last thing I wanted was to have to work for my dinner. However, we ordered the orange chicken for my nephew and it was great. Lightly breaded in tempura. There were four of us at the table and we all agreed it was by far the best orange chicken any of us had eaten. 

I just ordered the red chicken curry with chicken for takeout. The portion was a very good size, bigger than I expected. 

At first I was a little annoyed that they charged me .75 cents to use my credit card because my order was under $10. However, the food was pretty good, so I not really worried about the charge. 

Pro tip: First time online orderes get 10% off."}
{"text":"Their red curry chicken rocks and you can dial in your heater-meter from 1-10. Trying out 8 tonight for take out."}
{"text":"Nice ambience for an Asian restaurant and very good food.  Portions were large.  My cup of Tom Gha Ki was more like bowl size with so much chicken in it that it was a meal in itself.  Their fresh spring rolls were just that - fresh - not pre made and they included plenty of herbs.  Good, friendly service.  We recommend it."}
{"text":"Looooove this place. We come here all the time! Tom kha is great, actually pretty much everything on the menu is great. Get an iced Thai coffee too and the coconut ice cream!"}
{"text":"Great food and large portions.  We had Cashew Chicken and Green Curry, both were very good.  The value is excellent given the fair price and the large portion size.  The ambiance could be better, but it is made up for with the food."}
{"text":"First, a bit of background about me and my wife. We don't like spicy food, so all our food was ordered with minimum spiciness (perhaps the term is \"American wuss\"?). If part of how you judge Thai food is based on spiciness, this review may not be applicable.

Second, we had been to Thai house a few times off-and-on over the years, the most recent time being about a year ago. We only came back here because our FAVORITE Thai restaurant - Thai Rama at 13th Ave and Camelback, finally closed down a while back and we just had to get a Thai fix.

OK, with all that out of the way, here's what we ordered and what we thought:

First, we ordered the Thai Won Ton. This was a delicious soup; the chicken dumplings were firm and tasty (not overcooked as is often the case), and the broth had a delicious hint of garlic. Plenty of vegetables. The only down side here was there were no pork strips. Still, quite good.

We ordered two main dishes and an order of fried rice. All were generous portions (we've been eating left-over Thai for three days!). 

Pad Thai, the standard dish. Remember, we ordered it with minimum spiciness so it had NO bite at all. It was quite orange in appearance, a bit too much, I thought, which was a bit off-putting. But it was DELICIOUS! The sauce was sweet, the noodles firm, and lots of egg, veggies, etc.

The other main dish we ordered \"off the menu.\" My wife loves clear noodles, and the only clear noodle dish they had on the menu was a salad, served cool. We simply asked if they could make it up in a hot dish, and they quickly agreed to make Pad Woon Sen, which is a stir-fry based on clear noodles with lots of veggies. This is a light, tasty dish, and it was as good as our old stand-by, Thai Rama.

Both the Pad Woon Sen and the Pad Thai were served fresh and hot!

The fried rice was also delicious.

We were there relatively early on a Saturday evening. The place is small, with room for maybe 50 folks top, and during our visit there were probably only about three or four other parties present. Maybe that was the reason the service was so quick, attentive, and easy-going, but it truly was a delight.

BTW, their Thai Iced Tea is also great.

One downside - they do NOT have coconut ice cream for dessert.

But other than that, we were delighted and have found our new favorite Thai restaurant.

For the Thai Iced Tea, hot tea, large bowl of soup, two entrees, and fried rice, plus tip, it was $50. A bargain in my book.

I also liked that it has no television. 

The ambiance is fine - nothing to write home about. Years ago, they had a fountain-wall, but it no longer operates and just takes place and is relatively unattractive (showing the hard water stains on the plexiglas)."}
{"text":"Their food is so good, we are luck they are so close to our home. Delivery is the fastest of any place we've ever ordered from, Thai or any other type of food. We've been coming here for years & we love the guy that does their deliveries, he so nice & quick to get here. The food is always consistently made & tastes amazing. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I am completely and thoroughly obsessed to the core with Pad Thai. I love all the different flavors and textures. I probably eat it about once a week. At least it isn't too horrible for you. 

Thai House is my 'go to' Pad Thai place simply because it's less than ten minutes from my house. For a little over $9 you get a huge portion of Chicken Pad Thai, it usually lasts me for about two meals. 

I always get it 3 out of 5 spicy, with extra peanuts. Sometimes they remember the peanuts, sometimes not, so I usually check before I leave. 

Sometimes it's perfectly prepared with a good amount of sauce and tender chicken. Other times, it's dried out and and kind sad and pathetic. It's hard to tell when it will be a hit or a miss, so I just keep going back. 

God, now I think I need Pad Thai for dinner."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this place, and i was pleasantly surprised at the great tasting food and wonderful ambiance of this restaurant! I love the rad-na, chicken tomato and yellow curry!  Plus, service is always wonderful, and they are always happy to have you there. Great prices for a good amount of food, not to mention the Thai tea is BIG! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Thai House here and the other one on Pima. I come here when I have a large group as the other one is smaller inside.

As often as I come here, I never had anyone complaining about their food before. Everyone I came here was pleased with quality of food they serve.

My ultimate favorite here is Mus-sa-mum. Always order with beef and spicy level 5. This curry is sweet, so the spicy level 5 is just perfect for someone like me, cannot handle too spicy food. I also love their Thai Fried Rice. Taste so much like Japanese fried rice (or fried rice in Japan).

I ordered something new today, spicy eggplant. Surprised with rich flavor, I think this dish is going to be my regular item.  Pad thai, pineapple curry, yum woon sen, satay... they are some of my favorites too.

Price is very reasonable, we had seven people at lunch today and ended up being only $65 before the tip. We couldn't even finish everything we ordered.  Food comes relatively quick, great place to eat lunch.  I may not check in on Yelp as often as I come here but I am a regular here and the one at the Pima road."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Thai House, either this location or the one on Shea. I tend to go to the one on Shea more often as they are bigger inside, easily accommodate bigger group. It has been over two or three years since I came here and I was surprised they expanded.  Twice as big as they used to be.

Lunch menu is $6.95 comes with soup or salad. Portion is very generous. Panang curry I ordered in lunch size portion tasted the same as the one from dinner menu.  I normally come with a group of people, and order variety of food to share, so I didn't realize how nice their lunch menu/portion size was until the other day I came in.

They were packed by noon. I came around 11:30am and was seated immediately.  Food came quick, service was good. Nice place for a quick lunch as long as you come early."}
{"text":"Edit: 
After being to several Thai places after our visit here, I realized that this is actually probably the best in Vegas. Thai food just isn't the same here as it is where I've had it before in New York. 
Updated to 4 stars based solely on their curry dishes. 

This place was pretty decent. Coming from NYC, I've always been exposed to the best of ethnic cuisines. I had high hopes for this place since I haven't found a Thai place I really like yet. 

We ordered tom yum, Thai BBQ chicken, Thai house fried rice, and the fresh rolls. 

Tom yum was ok, it wasn't sour enough. 
The Thai BBQ chicken was $10 for a half and very overpriced for almost tasteless chicken. It was also very dry. 
The fried rice was probably the best thing that we ordered. It was flavorful and had a good amount of meat in it.
The fresh rolls were a big disappointment. They were made with tofu instead of the traditional shrimp. They also used iceberg lettuce instead of romaine. 
 
For lack of options, I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Best thai food in scottsdale as far as I'm concerned. Huge portions and very fair prices."}
{"text":"For months I've been meaning to visit Thai House as I have lunch many times in this plaza.  I'd forget, because it is all the way in the back corner. I finally scheduled myself to visit on this particular day.

I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes after it opened at 11 am.  So when I got there, there was plenty of parking.  I walked in and my first impression was, not bad, a mix of Thai and Chinese decor.

The ladies that greeted and seated me were very nice. So great customer service, right off the bat.

Where i was seated, I was surprised to see the vinyl on the middle part of the seat, where your knees would normally go, was torn :(  That's the first I've ever seen since moving to Las Vegas. My natural instinct was to look for other things.  My eyes were drawn to the wall as they had new dish items listed which were reasonably priced.  Because the menu on the wall drew my attention, it also drew my attention to the soy sauce splattered on the wall. 

As i flipped the menu to find the lunch specials. I was glad to see that their specials start at $7.99 and includes egg roll and your choice of soup.  I figured, this is my first time, let me try something that I know which would allow me to compare the dish to others. I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken, one of my all time favorites.

While waiting for my order, I go to the restroom.  The restroom is in the back of the restaurant where you have to walk past the kitchen and where all the cleaning stuff is at.  I get to the restroom where I can immediately see two stalls because the door is propped wide open.  It makes going to the restroom a little uneasy when you hear men working.  The restroom, for the most part is clean.  However, it isn't difficult to see the missing tiles on the floor.

Let's talk about the food since the experience so far is turning me off.  

Best thing that I tried was their egg roll.  Egg drop soup and fried rice was a little more on the bland side, while the Pad Thai was just ok.  It had a fair amount of chicken, but even that didn't have as much taste.  The dish itself was overly flavorful because it was overly sauced.

One of the big pluses of Thai House, is that they participate in Yelps Cashback program.  So it was nice to see I got a few cents back from this experience.

Atmosphere and cleanliness does make a huge difference in a dining experience.  For now, I'll rate this visit a 2 but I hope to raise this on my next visit."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and this place has the goods, they even have different levels of how hot with spice your entree can be served. Pad Thai is my go to dish and how I measure the Thai places I frequent and Thai House did not disappoint me one bit. The portions are enough for two people to share and  they have many other dishes to choose from. We went on a Wednesday night there was no waiting and the food was served fresh and fast.  They even do an awesome job of packing  to-go orders which is an art in itself.  Go to the Thai House you will be glad you did."}
{"text":"I live next door and frequent this little place when I'm running late for school or coming home late from work. Either way it's a great take-out place. I repeat, great for take-out! I've dinned in twice but everything took such a long time. Sweet but inexperienced waitress. 

I normally get the spicy fried rice, wonton soup, or spicy noodle. Pad Thai is good as well. The reason for three stars is their fluctuation in quality and inconsistency in their spicy level (because I like it HOT!). 

Only negative comment I have is their spring rolls. I've had better (that were also cheaper!!), so I advise against the rolls."}
{"text":"I was craving spicy food today, so a coworker recommended this restaurant to me. Man oh man was that a good recommendation. I came in and ordered a spicy fried rice dish and a Thai iced tea (because it's the most wonderful drink in the world, right after horchata which is the most fantastic drink in the world). I can handle my spice, but the spicy fried rice at spice level 3 will leave you eating slower and breathing harder. Which is exactly what I wanted. If you're not one for spice, save yourself and get a level 1.

I came around 5pm, right after work, and thankfully it's not super busy. Still probably about 20 people in the restaurant, which is always a good sign at 5pm when you're competing with the nearby happy hours.

I really like this place. It's not huge, with four booths and about 10 other tables, but it's comfortable and the hosts are extremely friendly. My fried rice is great and super filling. And let's be honest, you can never go wrong with Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Love it! Finally found a Thai place as good as my favorite in Fresno, CA... and it's name happens to be Thai House too! LOL Yummy! I only order delivery or pick up so I can't rate the service, but the delivery driver is always so sweet and they're great about bringing all the sides/sauces we request!"}
{"text":"It's Thai food.  And pretty good too.  Big portions, we have lunch for tomorrow.

And now I am going to rant a bit about Yelp, because yes my review is probably too short. But I don't always want to write a paragraph about every restaurant that I visit.  Sometimes I just want to give a star rating and not say anything at all.  So why don't you let me do that instead of complaining about my short review and not letting it count!  It's the star rating that makes or breaks these restaurants half the time anyways.  Don't be a review Nazi."}
{"text":"This is a great place for lunch.  The food is consistent and so is the service.  My issue is with take out.   

I came in and ordered 3 take out dishes.  They told me it would take 15-20 mins.  I accepted this as it seems standard for most take out ordered elsewhere.  20 minutes passed, 25 minutes passed, 35 minutes passed....   I asked what is the issue?   They said they were still cooking my Thai Fried Rice, Tom soup and Pad Thai.  The people that came in the same time as I and sat down to have dinner were finished and paying.  Other take out orders we placed and they gave them complimentary Thai Tea.  40 mins passed and no one even offered me complimentary water...  45 minutes later my order arrives.  At this point I am late and lost my appetite.  

I recommend as a decent lunch destination but will never order take out again.   It appears they support more in dining rather than both dine-in and take out although they had a decent demand for take out while I was there."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this restaurant, only went because of the Yelp ratings. The food was either overcooked or raw...absolutely horrible experience. We frequently go out for Thai food, this was probably the worst we've ever had. We even declined the left overs, we always take them home or pass them on to a financially challenged person...even a homeless person who dumpster dives would not have eaten this stuff. Move on..
Do NOT eat here."}
{"text":"Thai food is one of my favorite things to eat so I'm a bit more critical than normal. My boyfriend and I wanted to grab a quick bite in Henderson and I must say, this Thai place is one of the better ones I've tried here.

The waitresses were very cordial and the place was clean. We decided to order the usual papaya salad (thai style). The flavoring for it was good, but it wasn't sour enough. We had to ask for more lemons to make it taste better. Next, we ordered the spicy squid w/ green beans and Yai-kee Maow. The spicy squid was actually very good! It was sweet, yet not too overbearing that you can't taste the spice. It's a good dish to share and eat with rice. The yai-kee maow, however, did not impress me at all. I could barely remember eating it. I wouldn't recommend this dish unless you really don't like Pad-see ew which usually is the better choie for flat noodles. 

I'm going to give this place another try since it's close by and not too expensive. All the dishes ranged from $8-10. I think next time I'll try the more typical Thai dishes."}
{"text":"We go here for family meals at least once a month and do take out in between. The restaurant is always clean and the food is good quality and hot (surprising how many restaurants can't do that part). Love the Thai fried rice. Their fried tofu is the best. Thom ka gai is very good. Hard to find better than this in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This has been my fav Thai place since moving to vegas (other than Le Thai on fremont) and the curries are great. But last times we've gone I think they have been under staffed long wait even to be greeted. I think it's worth it... But I can see why the Stars have gone down in recent months on Yelp"}
{"text":"This place was empty and that usually makes me worry. But the food was fantastic. We had our usual spring rolls, Tom Yum and Pad Thai...it was all excellent and hit the spot."}
{"text":"Love this place. Some of the best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand. Always fresh, hot, and delicious. You have to try the chicken satay. Their peanut sauce is delish!"}
{"text":"This is a good, solid Thai restaurant in the Southeast Las Vegas area that provides big portions and tasty food. 

The prices were pretty standard as far as Thai restaurants go, but I was surprised to find they didn't skimp on the meat. My husband and I ordered the tom kha soup, crab fried rice and masaman curry. We were stuffed and still had enough leftovers for dinner.

The thai tea was delicious and served in a tall glass - again, they didn't skimp and fill the glass with ice like other places. The only thing they skimped on was the crab in the crab fried rice... crab was practically non-existent.

Service was warm and friendly. I love how they packed away all of our leftovers for us. Originally I was going to rate this 3 stars but after finding out that they do online ordering and can deliver as far as Southern Highlands, then my review bumped up to 4 stars. Any restaurant that provides that extra convenience deserves extra brownie points."}
{"text":"Thai House does a SOLID lunch! Healthy, lots of options and cheap prices. Get here early because there will be a line around the block from all of the regulars who work in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. We order take out lunch from here all the time. They have a great lunch special for $6.95 that includes entree, steamed or fried rice and soup or salad. The portion sizes are large. Great value for the price. I usually get the spicy basil chicken or panang curry. The panang curry is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I had dinner here a few times before, since it is so close to where I used to live.  I enjoyed the Tom Yum Shrimp soup every time I had it.  The shrimps were cooked nicely.  I have also ordered the Salmon Curry and Thai House Fried Rice.  

The reason why I ordered the Salmon Curry was because I wanted to try something different than my usual order of Beef Panang.  BAD IDEA.  Salmon Curry tasted odd.  Just did not work for me.  

I was looking for the Crab Fried Rice on the menu, or something in comparison to Pin Kaow's Crab Fried Rice.  The Thai House Fried Rice was the choice.  Didn't enjoy that as much either.  

Will I come back..yeah, I will for the Tom Yum Shrimp and the Beef Panang if I am in the area.  Also, the staff has always been very friendly."}
{"text":"Three of us went for dinner.  We ordered the spring rolls that come 2 at a time.  So I asked if they could give us 3 spring rolls instead - just toss on another and charge us for it.  \"Oh no.  The cooks won't do that.  You have to get two orders\" .  So we get two orders.  We ordered several other items and finally when we were done, we had one spring roll on the table.  When I asked for it to be boxed the server asked if I really wanted it.  Heck yeah - you made me buy an extra one - feel free to box one spring roll.

The service was pretty much like that the whole night.  I'd suggest take-out.

They ask you what kind of spice rating you want - medium, hot, etc.  I'm not sure why, the medium was hotter than the hot which doesn't say much.  There's no Thai spicy at this place."}
{"text":"Damn... Helen Y beat me to the punch and got the FTR for this place!  Oh well, I will say that she did a great job with her review - I think I was Thai in a past life; I swear, I could eat Thai food every night and be happy.  I was having a usual Thai food craving, so I popped into Thai House this evening and ordered the spicy eggplant dish (add extra veggies and tofu) - medium spice + brown rice to go.  (Yes, they have brown rice!)  I was totally blown away by how great  my dinner was!

The sauce was just spicy enough, the tofu firm, and the veggies flavorful.  I was impressed that the order was filled with big chunks of luscious eggplant (I really love eggplant), but since I had them add extra veggies, it came with spinach, mushrooms, cabbage, broccoli, carrots, onions, and peppers too.  My total was $11.82, and I had the best dinner I've had in a long while.  I probably could've had enough leftover for lunch tomorrow, but it was so good, i ate it all!

I can't wait to go back to Thai House to try some of the other menu items soon!  If you're looking for good Thai food in Scottsdale, give Thai House a shot!"}
{"text":"I've been a big fan of the other Thai House location for awhile now, so I was excited when I noticed this fairly new location was up and running and a lot closer to where my current home is located.  I've ordered take out from this location twice and both times I've been completely satisfied.

Tonight I called in the following order for four of us:
-2 orders of summer rolls
-1 order pad Thai with chicken and shrimp - medium spice
-1 order pad seu eu with shrimp and extra broccoli - medium spice
-1 order eggplant with  mixed veggies
-extra rice

My brother picked it up fifteen minutes later and it was delicious!  Each dish was filled with flavor and just enough kick.  Everyone enjoyed the meal... not only was it affordable, but it traveled well.

Now if Thai House would only open another location in Old Town, or if they delivered, I'd be one happy camper!  But in the meantime, I highly recommend take out from Thai House."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located next to the Smith's and has big private lot so there is always parking everywhere. The first time I had went here with a friend, it was very awkward. Beyond awkward. We stood at the \"Please Wait to Be Seated\" sign for about two minutes before one of the workers decided to acknowledge us and seat us. Our food was delicious! I always get the pad see ew at everywhere thai joint I go to and this place definitely did not disappoint. My friend got the pad thai with the level 6 spice and she was chugging on her water the whole time. Haha. The service was pretty decent the whole time and it was an OK experience. Nothing memorable except being awkwardly stared at by already seated patrons. 

The second time I went was less awkward, but it just told me that this place and me being physically there was not meant to be.

That is why I stick to ordering ONLINE and having them deliver :) that way I did not really have to deal with anyone. Their online ordering is so simply and they have a mobile site for your iPhone as well! I have only had one issue with ordering online and that was when an hour and a half passed with no food so I called to see what the hold up was. The woman who answered did not speak English so I gave up, haha. Luckily my food came about 15 minutes later but that is still a really long wait. Just remember that if you order online that it is a $20 minimum. The driver's tip is not included so tip accordingly! I will just keep ordering online and get some bomb pad see ew that way."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer since 2008. My wife and I were searching for a good Thai restaurant when we first visited Thai House. After our first visit, its been a monthly thing for me and my wife.

I have recommended the restaurant to many of my friends, colleagues and even strangers. So far, all of them loved it and have become regulars as well.

The service is fantastic. Tables are always clean, food is served fast and hot. Even take-outs are always served complete with napkins and utensils.

What I love to drink? Soon as I get a table, my first order is always the Thai Iced Tea. Some may find it on the sweeter side but my taste buds says its just right. It is a traditional iced tea with what I believe is full cream milk. I had similar drinks when I visited Thailand and it is at par to the local thai drinks. 

What I love to eat? Pad thai is my favorite. They offer choices of shrimp, chicken, beef and tofu. I usually mix and match but whichever protein I choose, I have never gone wrong.

What else to love? Just recently I tried the seafood soup. It was the bomb! It had fish, scallops, muscles, and a variety of fish cake. Also had some lemongrass, ginger and other asian spices. The serving was big. Maybe 3 people can share it. Well it depends on your appetite, I guess. But it is a must try. I also love the panang, curry dishes and their fried rice. So many options and Have never gone wrong.

Overall, one of my favorite in the valley. Cheap, good service and good food. Certified yum for the buck!

{"text":"Great noodles, pad see mau (flat noodles), Tom yum soup!  Very nice and attentive.  Even brought me soda water when I spilled soup on my shirt!  I will be back.  Would have liked actual whole Thai peppers.  I ordered 4 out of 5 heat which was about perfect."}
{"text":"Had the green curry with shrimp (spicy level 5/6).  It was soooooo good. I usually eat my curry with a half rice have curry but this time I pretty much forgot about the rice. The curry was that good. The food was a 10and the customer service was a 10!!"}
{"text":"I always come here for lunch specials. The whole staff is very friendly and the place is very clean. The atmosphere is very quiet but everyone makes the little kids feel comfortable. Food is great and tastes good. They always ask how much spice you'd like in the food which I thought was very considerate. The price is not cheap but fair. I tried their coffee for the first time and was delighted. I'd give it a 5 but I'm hoping they'd offer kid meals so it's not too expensive for me to bring a group or company."}
{"text":"Came here with the family before our flight on a Monday at around 11am. It was empty and we were seated right away. Service was great and food came out promptly. Then it went downhill from there. They also serve Chinese American food - not recommended. We ordered the Panang curry, pad Thai, and thai BBQ chicken. Each combo comes with rice, soup, appetizer (egg roll and won ton - fried Costco) - but for 6.99$ it's a bargain. The Panang and Pad Thai were good. The Thai BBQ chicken tasted like Indian Tandoori (not good). Then they were besieged by the lunch rush.

Flocks of folks came in one after another at noon. I guess other folks want the bargain deals. Most of them were Caucasian or Mexican-- so you can guess on quality and taste.

I would suggest the nearby Full House BBQ. Better food and comparable prices. They are not open on Monday/Tuesday.

Hence why we ended up here. Again, not bad if you are on a budget, portions are decent.

But don't expect to be rocked with flavor."}
{"text":"One star from me for two reasons:

I was told a delivery order would take 40 minutes and it actually took 70.

I specified no onions or bell peppers in a dish and they just made it like normal."}
{"text":"Love Thai House! It is down the street from me, so I go there quite a bit. Mostly I get takeout, but dining in has been good as well. The interior is nice, much nicer than their Pima location which happens to be near where I work and often eat lunch. I always get the Phad Thai which, even if you order spicy #5, isn't that spicy. Sala Thai has it right when it comes to the spice, but that is another review. 

I recommend this place- whenever I am sick, I go and get their wonton soup- the broth is excellent! Enjoy it, the price is right and the food is great."}
{"text":"My husband and I are big fans...  Definitely minimal decent Asian take out in the Silverado Ranch area, so this place always hits the spot.  In fact, we always order way too much, so we can eat the leftovers next day.

Pork Larb, Singapore Noodles, Chicken Chili Mint are fantastic, but be careful on the spiciness!  They are not kidding around.  My husband usually goes overboard at 7 stars and sweats his way through dinner!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Las Vegas! They deliver quickly. The Tom kha soup and papaya salad are my favorite! They can be spicy so go with mild if you've never dined here. Be sure to try the Thai ice tea for a pick me up. Absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the best thai food in Az. We go here at least twice a week, to see our favorite server Josie. She is awesome, this place is very busy for lunch, but she always takes care of us and we leave so satisfied. We order the egg rolls, thai green curry and Tom Kha gai soup."}
{"text":"Shrimp salad was ok but the service was not.. Long story short.. Here's a tip Thai House, it's never a good idea to argue with a customer. Ever."}
{"text":"Met Rand H for lunch here.  Had a good red curry with chicken. Medium heat was exactly what I was expecting.  Service was excellent.  Pricing was reasonable with the lunch menu we chose from.  I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"ordered delivery. such good food and good service. the food was here in less than 30 mins on a Saturday night. got the chinese broccoli with steamed tofu and shrimp with brown rice and egg rolls. 
the person who answered the phone was very well mannered and accommodating. please go here and eat. great. thanks. :)"}
{"text":"We have been to Thai House many times and have enjoyed the food there as well as the generous portions. This review, though, is about the service (or lack thereof).

We decided to go there on a Sunday night. Sure, for many that would be considered an off night, but it was crowded nonetheless. It is a shame that in the whole restaurant, there appeared to be only one waiter. When we walked in, the looks on the faces of the patrons should have been our first tip-off that trouble lay ahead. People had their checks in their hands, or were desperately looking for someone in authority to serve them. Eventually, the lone waiter saw us and gestured to us (we think) to sit anywhere. We made our way over to a booth that had seen its better days, with a torn seat that needed replacement desperately. We sat and chatted, sat and chatted, etc., all-the-while watching the increasingly-despondent other guests.

It seemed that the several staff people we did see were entirely focused on the takeout business. How can you ignore the hungry faces, the frustrated faces, so desperately trying to get your attention. I thought there was going to be a mini-riot. Unfortunately for everyone else there, they had either finished their meals and were waiting to pay, or they had ordered and were awaiting their food, or they were somewhere in between. For us, we had not quite fully entered this culinary purgatory, so after experiencing what it must be like to have a cloak of invisibility for far too long, we left.

As I said, we enjoyed this restaurant in the past, so we might try it again. Sure, they may have had just one bad night. One very, very bad night. But you are only as good as your last service, so the next time around will have to be excellent to resurrect this place in our minds' eye."}
{"text":"Slow, slow, slow.  We have been here many times, and we have also ordered food for pick up and delivery.  Tons of experience with Thai House.  Unfortunately, I think this may be the last time we eat here.  Ordered food for delivery and 1.5 hours later we still have no food.  Called the restaurant and are told that the driver will be here in 15-20 minutes.  Ummm...we live right down the street.  Apparently they forgot to make our food.

This is just the last in a long string of crappy service.  When you dine in, everything always takes FOREVER.  And the servers are never very friendly.  For the price and quality of the food, I would suggest that you get your Thai fix elsewhere."}
{"text":"We love Thai house! Clean, fast service, excellent food. Lunch specials are nice portions, fair price.

We stick with Thai Basil, spice level 5, delicious! The to go portions are huge, easily two meals for each one.

Love it!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but we paid $50 for the equivalent of 3 appetizers. I was shocked (actually shocked) by how small the entrees were.  Order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is consistently great! Their red curry is my personal favorite and the spring rolls are delicious. The red curry is honestly fantastic and you can't go wrong with a number of dishes on their menu such as the drunken noodles, Penang curry, and soups. Their service is very good and the food comes out in a relatively good amount of time. The serving sizes are huge and I always have leftovers and I eat a lot. Very cheap with a curry being around $15. You can't go wrong with a place like this."}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend there for lunch the other day.  Waited 5~10mins seated at table for my girlfriend to show up.  The whole time ignored by the waitresses.  

Finally my girlfriend shows up, we order, our food arrives with no utensils on the table for us to eat with.  I had to practically shout down the waitress to bring us table settings.

All this would not have made me give this eatery a one star . . . the thing that really ticked me off was my girlfriend wanted to have shrimp in her dish.  Paid $2 extra on top of a $6.95 lunch special.  That's a 25% surcharge.  The dish comes and I look for the shrimp . . . THREE, that's right, THREE measly, little shrimps.  

Those shrimps better have been organically raised and human fed for the price they charged.

I complained to the waitress.  Instead of taking the $2 off of our bill, she tells us she would take 5% off of the total bill which amounted to $0.60.
Wow, that's a big deal . . . not.

Then she comes back and tells me that she can't do the % discount because the computer won't let her do that during lunch, only during dinner.  Really?!  What kind of B.S. is she feeding me??

Hint:  if you are working as a waitress, be honest and bend over backwards for your customers because they are the ones paying you, not the $2.50/hr. you get paid from the restaurant!

I was so mad over the whole incident that I actually did not tip my waitress and I usu. am a generous tipper.

Needless to say, Thai House has lost a couple of customers over $2.  Really, $2 for 3 shrimps.  Haven't they heard that times are bad and people want to feel like they are getting some value for their hard earned dollar?

And please, don't feed me some B.S. about the computer can only discount a bill during dinner!

TWO THUMBS DOWN!!"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch not expecting much for the price, but it definitely surprised me positively. Food was of great quality. Tasted great, smelt great and isn't overpriced. Definitely a recommendation if you just son't know what to grab for a lunch. Had the spicy chicken basil lunch special. Chose medium, me not really liking my mouth burned, thought it had the perfect kick to it. Try it, it won't go wrong. Be careful as they close at 3, after lunch."}
{"text":"I spotted Thai House while driving on Shea one evening.  I love Thai food, and my friend who is gluten free noted their menu provided many gluten free options. 

The restaurant is located in a little shopping center and is a medium sized restaurant.  I ordered the Tom Yum (as usual) and some curry with green beans, carrots, and potatoes.  I was pleasantly surprised at the perfect \"sneaky spicy\" of all of it.  The curry dish was humongous, and after dining in, I will have at least four more meals out of it.  The Tom Yum cup of soup was also a very large cup and was more like a bowl. The prices were normal for this type of food.  We went on a Saturday evening, rather early, and the service was excellent. 

My friend ordered the green curry with seafood. She raved about her food and enjoyed the brown rice option. 

The service was an issue this past evening when my friend and I were craving Thai food. The wait staff saw us, and 20 minutes passed without one waitress asking us what we'd like to order.  They were rather busy, but we stayed for the 20 minutes and we were completely ignored!  The table of people who had come in at the same time were giving their orders a few minutes after they arrived. I don't know why we wasted so much time, but we left after we were again ignored by the wait staff."}
{"text":"Last night, my wife and I returned to the Thai House to try some of their other offerings.  This time some of the items that we ordered were good but feel short of GREAT...

We decided to eat lighter tonight so we shared the items.  For our appetizers we ordered their Thai House Salad which turned out to be a mix of shredded lettuce, carrots, red cabbage, some sliced cucumber and tomatoes pieces topped with a very tasty Thai Peanut Dressing - the dressing was a WINNER!  If I could have bought a bottle to take home with me, I would have bought two!  Our second appetizer was the Satay Chicken Skewers which was only just OK. The portion size was four small pieces of rather bland chicken in an unremarkable peanut sauce.  I definitely would NOT order the Satay again!

Our dinner entree was the Spicy Basil Beef which overall was good but could have benefited from a more intense spicy profile as it wasn't what I expected given the \"Spicy\" in its name.  It had a good taste but need to be bolder to put it over the top! 

For dessert, we tried the Thai Custard with Sweet Sticky Rice.  After having the Thai Custard last night, the Sweet Sticky Rice didn't add anything to the dessert except to its price - it definitely was not worth the added $ 2.45 to get the Sweet Sticky Rice and not get whipped cream!  Just stick to the Thai Custard and you won't be disappointed!

Overall, I had to take back the fifth star but I still look forward to returning on our next visit to Elyria to give some of their other dishes a try!!!"}
{"text":"I found myself in Scottsdale on a business conference, and I turned to Yelp to find a good Thai restaurant in the area.  I chose Thai House because of its location and 4 star rating.

After being spoiled by Thai food after visiting Thailand, my taste buds may be spoiled, but this was far from a 4 star rating.

I chose the chicken Pad Thai on the lunch menu which came with soup and rice (I chose the fried rice).

The soup was an egg drop soup that had an abundance of egg drop, but no flavor at all.  With some coaxing from some soy sauce and hot sauce, the soup was edible, but I would never order it off the menu.

The Pad Thai and rice came on the same plate.  The chicken was dry, and the noodles flavoring was mainly hot spices, with raw chopped scallions mixed within.

The amount of food was abundant, the service was quick and attentive, but the food lacked taste.  The people on each side of me ordered the chicken panang, which they said was excellent, but I'm evaluating this on the Pad Thai"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the area, clean restaurant great service and food that exceeds expectations

Recommend the green curry chicken as well as all of their soups."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees with fried rice. The 2 entrees came first and after we finished the entrees the appetizers came. The service was so slow, and the food is not good either. I dont know, not coming back, theres alot of thai places and this aint one."}
{"text":"Food tastes good. You get a lot of meat, so that's a plus. They don't have fried rice, was not too happy about that. I can't substitute rice for chow mein not happy about that either."}
{"text":"It was great to be able to find a cute little Thai restaurant (at the recommendation of a good friend from High School) to be able to visit while I am home in Las Vegas (going through withdrawals from Thai Taste in New Haven, CT). 

There are a few dishes that I really just am a sucker for on any given Thai menu, and therefore use them as standards by which to judge the various restaurants. Tom Yum Goong, which is a clear broth soup made with lemon grass, mint, and chili paste and really just is a fantastic starter encapsulating the various flavor combinations which Thai food has become famous for incorporating. Here, they did not have a small, single person serving (lest you wanted this as a whole meal, versus just as a soup on a cold day), but it was so flavorful, I did not mind (nor did the other people at the table who, unbegrudgingly ate their portion). 

As an entree, I love the noodle dishes, and close to my heart is the Yai Kee Ma-Ow (read: drunken noodles). Here they were chewy and had just the right amount of sauce to coat the noodles, but not to leave them swimming in excess. I ordered them with pork... oh pork, how I love you... which was just on the right side of crispy without being overdone. 

Finally, for dessert, it does not matter what Asian inspired restaurant one visits, it seems that they all have banana spring rolls... though here we had, what we were told, was homemade coconut ice cream to boot! Yum!"}
{"text":"Just ok.  Food ok nothing new.  Small dirty. This place needs something to set itself apart.  Looks dingy tables sticky."}
{"text":"Went to get take out, the waitress gave me anxiety by rushing us, the boba is a big size but not cooked properly, their chow mein is overpriced, they charge you to use a debit card, and the waitress chased me outside while I was driving away to have me sign a receipt."}
{"text":"What an outstanding place. Fresh food, great service, we will be back :-)"}
{"text":"while i miss sabudy's that used to be in this spot, i'm very happy that i can still find food i love in this location!
so as for food, i give 5 stars.  but they put a fountain inside, and its so loud for this tiny space.  there's nothing to absorb the sound so trying to have a conversation is almost impossible.  take out is an option and i've done both eat in and take out, and there is no loss of quality by taking it home.
by far the best dish there is the pineapple fried rice.  it is absolutely delicious!!  while we usually have some to take home of our other dishes, this goes rather quickly.  you get a nice crunch from the cashews and sweetness from the pineapple.  we get a bit spicy so you get that too.  just really nice flavors.
we've also tried the rice noodle soup, which is good but we got served with a ridiculously tiny serving spoon.  we also asked for the shrimp on the side (i don't eat it, but everyone else in my party did) and they only brought out 4.  the ginger delight with chicken is also very tasty.  the yellow curry is really good and nice on a \"cold\" arizona winter evening. the massamun curry is also very good.
lastly, i had a bit of their thai iced tea.  it was nice, not too sweet but lots of good flavor.
i'm a big fan of thai food, and this is one place that i keep going back to."}
{"text":"Service is ok but their food is worth it. Great panang curry and pad Thai. If you don't like pad Thai with a little extra sauce you might not like it as much though."}
{"text":"good food, had Pad Thai with chicken and chicken curry lunch specials. both were good. Can't believe it was so close to me and hadn't tried it till now. will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Not the best. Ordered Tom ka, was not impressed with the lack of veggies.there was tons of chicken though. Las Thai across the street is much nicer, and better quality thai"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food.
The Panang-flavor was memorable.
Perfect blend of spice, just the right heat and after burner flavor.
 Definitely coming to Thai House every chance I get. Staff were friendly, very helpful and inviting.
ViviAna went the extra mile and coached me on my order."}
{"text":"I love their lunch specials! Amazing food and great price for lunch. Super easy ordering online and delivery is quick. Yellow curry and crab rangoon is my go to order!! Great service too. Staff is super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The food was good , the ambience was good as well . The night we were there, i wasn't sure if they were understaffed. There was no receptionist to welcome the guests. Looks like there were only three servers that night . Although  understaffed  , our server made sure we were satisfied . Like what I mentioned , the food's very good . We'll definitely come back when we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Next to Bankok Orchid in Henderson, this is one of the best Thai places in the greater Vegas area.  The staff is super friendly and very attentive (without smothering you).  Their tom kha gung soup is delicious with plenty of mushrooms and shrimp (or chicken) and very flavorful.  The prices are reasonable and the value is definitely there. I never leave hungry!  The decor is lovely and even the waiters wear colorful thai clothing which just adds to the whole experience."}
{"text":"I like this Thai place. It's specially busy during lunch time so be ready to wait in line. The service was so so but it may be because it was busy when I visited the place. The food is very good and the menu is pretty extensive but if you go there for lunch time, they have better pricing for their lunch specials. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you're hungry and you don't know much about thai food. This place is pretty okay. I have no complaints. They wait staff was kind and attentive, the food was timely, and the restaurant was clean. 
I just wasn't knocked off my chair with deliciousness the way i like to be with Thai food.

The portions are sharing size so an appetizer and an entree will be enough for two. Try the Iced Thai Tea. It was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is the freshest, best Thai food I have ever had. The wonton soup tastes like they make it to order, and the chow mein is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is a simple place with friendly staff and very very good food. We like our food spicy and ordered both dishes with full spice (5 on a scale of 1-5) . It's not what I'd call Thai hot, but it was just fine. My wife ordered 55. Spicy Salmon                         $12.95
        Deep fried salmon, then stir fried with curry paste,
    chili, onions, bell pepper and basil leaves. It was delicious. I ordered 34. Green Curry                            $9.95
        Tender meat in a blend of green curry curry paste,
     mixed with coconut milk, bell pepper, carrots,
     basil leaves and bamboo shoots. I had mine with chicken. As we often do, we split both dishes. I found the salmon spicier, though both dishes were enjoyable. My wife doesn't eat duck or I would have tried Curried duck, which isn't on the regular menu but was listed as available today. The portions were decent since we didn't order off the lunch menu. We've both had enough of lunch menu standard fare. This restaurant has three locations, and we've eaten at two of them."}
{"text":"Roaches are crawling on floor. Food was just ok . Everything was sweet tasting for some reason. Fried rice was gross"}
{"text":"Really nice staff and some relaxing live music too. A friend told me about this place and recommended the yellow curry. I had it with chicken and it was delicious! The panang curry is also good here. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I just came here with my wife & we had the best food! We started off wontons, they were perfect! We ordered Pad Thai which was amazing! I also ordered won ton soup & it was also great. The staff is very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"The worst Thai food I have ever had. Spring rolls were nothing but shredded lettuce and the Pineapple Fried Rice tasted really strange."}
{"text":"Sorry yelpers, I'm not a fan like most of you but I really wanted to be part of this fan club. However, it just didn't cut it for me. I ordered takeout: Thai tea, beef panang and chicken pad se ew. The Thai tea was awful. All I could taste is half and half so I threw half of it away. The pad se ew was bland, very bland. The panang was probably the best dish out of the three but I didn't think it was phenomenal. Good, but not great. Im bummed because I really want to find a great Thai restaurant in this area. For me, this wasn't it."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and welcoming.  There is plenty of parking and shopping in this outdoor mall.  We ordered the Basil Chicken and Spicy Chicken.  Their hotness range goes from 1-5 with 5 being the most spicy.  We settled on a level 3.  The food came quickly and the meal seemed very mild on a level 3.  We would try level 4 next time.  No problem as we added chili oil to our meals to make them perfect.  The food is good.  The servings are ample and we had two take out meals for the next day.  One of the best shopping mall eateries around."}
{"text":"This is our new go to place for Thai food.  The curries are all excellent, so creamy and flavorful.  The vegetables in the curry are cooked perfectly.  I also tried the pad see ew and it was awesome, noodles were just right.  Prices are right in line with most thai places."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall with the best food around this area! Watch out if it's lunchtime, the place can get packed quick. Short and sweet? No beer, water sucks so I get it to go: Tom Yum '3' spicy and Kung Pao '2' Spicy or a generic curry is always great. YUM"}
{"text":"Yessssss! Excellent food!

Dropped off my wife and daughter to my daughter-in-law's mother's house in Scottsdale for a baby shower, had about an hour to kill before I pick them up to take my wife to the airport. It's suppertime. I open my trusty Yelp mobile app, tap on More, Bookmarks, and peruse \"Distance from Me.\" Well, lookit here, \"Thai House\" is just seven minutes away. And my Yelp friend and fellow Elite, Richa S. says it's the bomb. I'm going.

And am I glad I went. The food was AWESOME. I ordered the pad see ew with beef (Holy cow!) and the Panang curry with chicken (Holy bird!). They ask you on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the hottest, how spicy you want it. I ordered the pad see ew on a level 2 and the curry with level 3.

Level 2 was about right for me for the pad see ew. It definitely had a burn, but did not make my nose run and allowed me to enjoy the dish. Level 2 would be less than the burn of Sriracha sauce. Level 3 for the Panang curry was a bit too mild for me. I forgot that the coconut milk tones things down. I could have used Level 4.

As stated in some of the reviews, this place does not skimp. There was a ton of meat in the curry. And based on my take home container, they give more than a quart for the serving. This makes for great left overs at home. The pad see ew is the same--a LOT for the money. Both were extremely delicious.

Each plate was around $10. Very reasonable.

I highly recommend this restaurant. I am very sorry that I live so far away from it.

5* = A top favorite. Mind-blowing good. I will definitely return and I will go out of my way to go here. Worth every dime of my money.
4* = Outstanding. Tucson-top-tier. Some elements not quite as good as it gets, but it still is worthy of my regular business.
3* = Good experience. I might do repeat business if it is convenient, the only option, the only one in its category, or on a whim, but would not be among the first thing to come to mind. Would definitely recommend you trying it to get your own take on it.
2* = Not so good. Would not recommend at all. Waste of money.
1* = How are they still in business? Stay away at all costs!"}
{"text":"Never go to Thai House on Maryland Parkway! My mother and I watched a food handler (wearing hairnet and all) exit the restroom without washing her hands. When I reported my observation to a server and requested the general manager, the kid scurries away and returns after some time to tell me I misunderstood what I saw--that she was \"cleaning something inside the stall,\" and therefore, \"her hands were already clean.\" Oh, that's comforting... not to mention illegal.

When I asked for the manager again (loudly), the kid pointed an older Caucasian gentleman out sitting in a booth, lies that the man he just pointed out to me is unavailable, and then goes back on that lie and decides to tell me that the manager is actually in the back correcting the employee's unsanitary practices. I never got the truth, much less a manager. I had to abruptly walk out of there with my family even after we'd already placed our order because of these awful business practices. No joke--this place would be a health department official's delight. I'm making sure my friends and family never eat here (this place was dead as a door nail as it was... no mystery there after this experience). Unless you enjoy eating in third world country conditions, served by staff who are about as honest as politicians, avoid this place at all costs!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hidden gem. Staff is great and friendly. The food is also very tasty and I have yet to find a dish I do not truly like."}
{"text":"Avoid!! Avoid!! Avoid!!!
Believe the reviews below when they are warning you about the worst service at this Thai place. Not only is it the worst but quite possibly be the rudest. I placed a to go order for chicken yellow curry and was SPECIFIC and adamant that my curry spice level be no more then a level one. 

When I got home it was beyond spicy ( think level 9 or 10 ) to the point where I could not eat it neither could my roommate. Unfortunately they were closed so I could not call until today. 

When I did call back to let them know that I still had a full container of yellow curry that was too spicy and that was not what I ordered, the older lady who was working during the day was so rude to me. 

She said their spicy level was already cooked into the yellow curry and starts at a level 3 or 4. Wait what??? This woman on the phone was so filled with unpleasantness.The way she spoke to me was rude, aggressive and very unfriendly. I told her nobody told me that information on the phone last night when I placed the order for the curry and had I known I would have never ordered. 

She then told me there was nothing they could do and basically made it out that is was my fault. I have never dined at a Thai restaurant that did not let you choose your own level of spiciness. I have a full container of yellow curry sitting in my fridge that I guess I will have to throw out now just like my hard earned money wasted on this mediocre place.

I would sincerely advise anyone that is thinking about dining or getting a to go order here to go support another Thai restaurant in the area. The customer service here plays by their own rules and does not care about the customer at all. It is very disheartening that there is a business open that operates under this level of dishonesty. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten somewhere and thought: Where has this place been all my life? That was definitely my experience here. 

Given that this place is in Scottsdale you would think it would be exorbitantly overpriced with a small portion of food. I got the Panang Chicken Curry lunch special and upon first glance I did think it was a smaller portion. After I dug in however I could not finish it. 

But onto flavor! This curry was so delicious. I got a spice level of 3 because I love spicy but also know that my level of spicy and thai level of spicy are not typically aligned. The spice level was great though because it perfectly complimented the sweetness of the coconut milk. Add in the basil taste and I was very much in heaven. 

I was even happier when I received my check: $9 for a drink, egg drop soup and the lunch portion. The service was normal. Not over attentive or under and the place was small with tables for 1, which was great for me since I was on a lunch break. This will definitely be a new lunch regular for me!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. It gets really busy at lunch time so you should either come early or late if you want to sit down when you get there."}
{"text":"Based on the good Yelp reviews, we came here for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon. The place was packed, which we seemed to be a positive sign, and we were able to order right away: pad see ew with chicken, kung pao lunch special with fried rice and egg drop soup, papaya salad, tom ka gai soup, chicken satay, and the pad thai lunch special with steamed rice and egg drop soup. Unfortunately, warnings from previous reviewers about the service became increasingly apparent throughout our meal.

First, we received the two egg drop soups from the lunch specials. Then, the pad see ew, kung pao dish, other soup, and chicken satay came shortly after, along with a salad. Since we were hungry, we started digging into the salad before realizing... wait, where is the papaya? It turns out that our server thought we asked for \"shrimp salad\", even though we explicitly asked for papaya salad. It was probably an honest mistake, but I presume this is why servers usually repeat back the order to double check for accuracy. After waiting a bit, we flagged down another server to fix the problem and received the correct salad, and this one definitely had papaya in it. 

The salad, along with all our other food, was good, but we still had another problem- where was our pad thai lunch special? We got the egg soup that came with it, so it was unusual that it was taking so long. Thus, we asked the waiter, and he assured us it was coming. However, a sizable amount of time had passed- enough time so that everyone else had eaten all their food- and the last person (whose dish had not yet arrived) ended up sharing some of the leftover noodles I couldn't finish. We were fairly upset by this and inquired again where the pad thai was, resigning to take it home. We were again assured it was coming. Some time later, we really had to get going, so I went to the cashier and asked them to cancel the pad thai, which they politely did, and I asked for the check. Then, we left, still disappointed. 

Based on the previous reviews, I had anticipated our entrees coming at slightly different times, but the two incidents in a row left us disappointed. Mostly, I was embarrassed that a member of our group didn't even have a real lunch, except the leftovers from one of our dishes. The food was good, but I wouldn't bring guests here based on this experience."}
{"text":"Love the Tom Ka Gai soup! Love the Pinapple Rice! Consistently pleased when ever I dine here...which is frequently."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai food in the Phoenix Metro area. Had dinner last night with my Brother and it was fantastic. I had Won Ton soup which was excellent and Kung Pao beef which I ordered spicy (5 on a spiciness scale of 1-5). It was 5pm on a Friday night and not very crowded. Service was excellent. Food portions huge. All entrees less than $10. GREAT VALUE!!! Small place and nothing fancy but I was blown away. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"I really like Thai House. I have come back to eat here at least 5 times now because the spicy basil chicken and fried wontons are awesome and I get cravings for them! The only reason I wouldn't give it a 5 star rating is because they get busy during peak hours and tend to be a little slow in getting the food out, but their food makes up for it! I have also tried the Garlic chicken which is good but I prefer the spicy basil. My friends have told me the Pad Thai is great, and Spicy Eggplant also tasty."}
{"text":"The portions are huge but it doesn't taste good! Got the pad see ew and it was so disappointing. The beef tasted so spongey like it's been frozen for days and thrown in the microwave."}
{"text":"I had the green papaya salad. It's a great, healthy alternative to my usual favorite, Pad Thai. They let you select the spice level which is nice for those that don't care for a lot of heat. Diner beware, if you choose spice level 5 it is the equivalent of eating lava. Lol"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I have had in AZ. It is very authentic and so affordable that it seems too good to be true. Ate lunch on a Monday and the service was superb. The papaya salad was as good as I have had. I have eaten at many of the top rated Thai restaurants in the country and have paid a lot more for equal or lesser quality. Too bad they don't have a liquor license, since the food would be complemented nicely by a German Riesling or Austrian Gruve!!!  (Guess I will have to order take out next time. 
Don't hesitate to try this place."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I got the spicy Thai noodle dish without meat and they gave me tons of vegetables. Portions are very generous. I got it a level 5 spice and it was perfect for me.

We did have to wait about 10 minutes before they took our to go order then about 15 more until the food was ready. They were very busy at the time but still I would have liked to see better service in taking our order efficiently. Perhaps more staff during busy times would help.

Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while searching on yelp and had a great reputation so had to try it out :) 

We were seated and greeted right away and had some time to look over the menu.  We decided to start with the Tom Yum soup- a bowl.  Not a huge bowl for 10.95 in my opinion but did not lack in flavor it was delicious and we ate it to the last drop. 
My dad got the special curried duck - this was in a red curry sauce and had great flavor.  The duck was cooked perfectly.  The only thing lacking was vegetables.  It just had red bell peppers and pineapple (not a lot). 
I had the Spicy noodles with chicken.  I am not complaining but there was more chicken than noodles and this too was lacking vegetables - I had bell peppers and thats it.  

I have had these dishes in Thailand and else where and everything is always loaded with veggies and thats what I love.  They nailed the flavor and have a great menu just wish it had a little more to it.

Service 10 
Atmosphere 10 
Food 9 
Beer 10 - they have Singha and Chang beer here - great Thai beers!"}
{"text":"Holy crap! Best food that I've had so far in AZ! Flavorful, quality, great service, etc. My new favorite spot. :)"}
{"text":"Only reasons I'm giving it 2 stars is cause the waiter was super sweet. Service was good but in all honesty... the food sucks. All of you know I'm extremely blunt straight up and honest. 

I wouldn't and won't come back 

Look how much food is left over... I'm only packing it to go cause maybe JUST MAYBE it'll magically taste better later?"}
{"text":"Great service, quick and friendly even though she was the only one hosting, bussing, and serving! Red beef curry was delicious as well as the spring rolls and jasmine iced tea!! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good and the service wasn't bad. A nice little restaurant. One of the better places to get calamari/squid in the area (that i've encountered so far). No major complaints or anything that will keep me from going back. 

I've only been here for lunch, but i imagine the dinner stuff is just as good.

I liked it and would probably make a return trip in the future if in the area again."}
{"text":"Don't order their pad see ew. I have had this dish for years at tons of restaurants and never has it been awful, until I tried it at this restaurant. Ordered a 3 star and it tasted like a 0. Ended up adding spices and salt to try to fix it. They just suggested adding soy sauce (even though this isn't a soy based dish). Didn't know you can mess up pad see ew until today. Service was not great either. But friend had pad thai and it was decent, so I'm guessing they just can't make this dish. Probably better to stick to the curry dishes that other reviews mentioned."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been here twice now and the food is amazing and authentic. The lunch specials are great, can't go wrong with the panang chicken and egg drop soup with chicken fried rice for $6.95. The staff is very nice and they remembered me but they do get behind at times with keeping your water full. Either way I'll keep coming back again and again, I've heard it's the best Thai in the valley so why waste time finding a new spot?!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!! After living in Arizona for THREE years and having no luck finding a good Thai place I stumbled upon this little gem. I almost didn't go in because it really looked like an Americanized little fast food place, however I was starving and my only other option was Peter Piper Pizza (YUCK) so in I went. The first good sign was that all of the tables were full and there were probably 10-15 people waiting for take out. It was very busy. We got a seat and order some Yellow Curry and Pad Thai noodles. When I bit into this food it was like angels were singing from Heaven. Truly fantastic food!! The prices are great as well and everyone who works there is super friendly. This is now 'my' Thai restaurant in the Phoenix area. I HIGHLY recommend Thai House!"}
{"text":"I was so surprised how GREAT the SALMON IN GREEN CURRY was!!!! DELICIOUS!! I mean basil, curry, coconut milk w/zucchini and bell pepper...mmmm.....on top of my rice. Dang, I feel like I could eat that everyday. Salmon was pretty good, I mean how couldn't it be all soaked up in the bomb curry. I'm sure it was Altantic Salmon (not a wild caught fish, which is better for you), but I would expect that.

Pad See Ew was pretty good. We had it with shrimp. Another pleasant surprise was that the shrimp were cooked perfectly. Who would of guessed that??? Well, I have been educated. I do like my noodles with more....well, uh....noodles. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, but I just wanted more noodles instead of the extra broccoli and egg. 

We ordered the House appetizers. I'm sure at the restaurant they taste better. By the time we got the food, all of the appetizers were pretty soggy or hard, and it's pretty much a fried food appetizer: eggrolls, wontons, fried shrimps, bbq pork, fried vegetables. I don't think that Thai House can really do anything about that though.  

We wanted delivery and I was willing to try this place instead of ordering another pizza. Man...am I glad we took a chance."}
{"text":"Just was contacted by the manager and he appologized for the service which I always appreciate. I changed my rating to a 3 for now until I go back again, so will update for next time I go.


Ordered the Pad Se Ew, tad salty but was great preportions and was good. The Egg drop soup was really good, nice and hot and nice seasoning. Good price overall, a little more than I expected in the end but was good."}
{"text":"This is our weekly family Thai dinner place.    Love the service and food at the Shea location.  Portions and the food is good.  The only reason it's a 3star vs 4 because they only give small bowl of rice and the food is not always in-consistent.  Asian restaurant should always have unlimited white or brown rice unless you are ordering items from lunch menu.  The yellow curry and pad Thai is excellent.  My husband loves the fish dish.   Overall it's good local Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I will make this quick and rather short. The service here is just awful, very rude and not friendly at all. The food is less then average and the quality is not very fresh or great. The flavors seem very generic. My pad thai noodles were soggy and the texture was rubbery. The curry was watery and way too spicy for my taste even though I asked for mild. I should have listened to the bad reviews below. Oh well. You live and learn. I will not be returning to this terrible place."}
{"text":"I have driven by Thai House so many time but didn't go there until this week when we had a company luncheon.  I can't believe I used to live around the corner and have never had their yellow curry! I really missed out.  The portion sizes are huge and the price is perfect. I loved everything from the chicken satay to my main dish. I will be returning monthly to fix my Thai craving :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and warm and friendly staff. The summer rolls, Thai curry with shrimp and eggplant are my personal faves. Their food is always made fresh.  The Thai fried rice is another yummy staple. Great for take out!"}
{"text":"I was VERY disappointed in the service when I made an order to be delivered. When I called they said it was very busy and it would probably be an hour wait. Understandable. 

2 hours later I hit RE-DIAL on my phone to make sure its still on the way. The poor woman who I had spoke to earlier on the phone sounded SO frantic trying to figure out the situation. 10 minutes later another woman picks up saying they don't have my order and that I probably called another restaurant... Uhm... pretty unlikely considering I hit re-dial...But it's ok. People make mistakes. I give her my order again including specials and deals (you spend over a certain amount, you get something for free) that I only would have known about if I were looking at THEIR menu! It will be delivered in the next 20 minutes. Awesome. But no apology, no free meal? I found that kind of odd...

The food finally gets to my house 50 minutes later... I explain to the delivery man I was just a little shocked that I would still have to pay after waiting almost 3 HOURS for my food. He throws up his hands saying \"Look lady, you never called us the first time\"... and as if I haven't made it clear by now.... I HIT RE-DIAL!!!! lol. Even after explaining that, he continues to give me a few nonsense excuses and that next time I should order the food online...... and I still had to pay......

The food on the other hand wasn't bad. Which is the only reason why they're getting 2 stars and not 1. A bit on the oily side and only lukewarm.. But if you scoop out the top layer of oil and warm it up yourself, its great. lol."}
{"text":"Thai food at this hidden gem will have you asking for seconds!

This place has been around for awhile and hasn't disappointed each time we come here.  The location is a bit hidden, tucked way back in the corner of the Smith's shopping center.  Each time we come in, I have never seen it packed either lunch or dinner.  The place is roomy and has a stage for live music.  We were seated promptly and our service was excellent.  I didn't have to sit with an empty water glass for long and the food arrived quickly, A+ on service.  After searching in Henderson for a good Fresh roll, I may have found it here at the Thai house.  I highly recommend them!   I also had some Orange Chicken and some Moo Poo Gai Chicken which were both very good.  In the past, I've had some of their fried rices and sometimes they can be hit or miss, I usually like these from elsewhere.  The soups are amazing here,  I really enjoy their Egg Drop, very tasty.  

An order of Orange Chicken, Moo Poo Gai Chicken, Fresh Rolls (4), a small Cucumber Salad and an Egg Drop soup (all of this food wasn't all just for me, I swear!  :P) ran about 36 bucks.  A lot of food, but still a bit on the pricy end.  Very good quality, I highly recommend this place if your are in the mood for Thai."}
{"text":"Service is not efficient. One time, it took nearly 10 minutes just for them to serve me my thai ice tea boba. The food takes an incredibly long time to serve. Our food even came out to our table almost cold.

I still go back only because I really enjoy their food. But other than that, it was not a good experience."}
{"text":"No Thai people here and it's a fusion restaurant. But the Thai food is surprisingly good. Don't expect much ambiance... But if you're looking for an informal lunch or dinner, this place does the trick. Service is a bit slow when you're ready to order, and for getting refills on your water... But it's fast when it's time to pay and get you out the door.

Pay attention to the posted hours. They're closed on Sundays :-("}
{"text":"This place is really good. I love their Kung pao chicken! It's awesome. A  a couple of negatives though, they do get orders wrong sometimes!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today after moving to the area a couple of months ago.  I had takeout  - Pad Thai (that's pretty much what I judge any new to me Thai place on)  with chicken and veggie eggrolls.  I asked that they make my Pad Thai with a medium amount of spice, and they got it exactly right.  The $6.95 lunch portion was generous.  I ended up with leftovers. They seem to do a good business, it was a little busy when I went in. I'm glad they're so close to where I live, because I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was average, definitely not authentic but reasonable price and generous portion. Lunch special is $6.95 from 11-3, this restaurant got filled up with the worker bees very quick during the lunch time. Cherry the waitress was very sweet and kind."}
{"text":"What a fantastic place!  Took my daughter here last year and they were even patient with my two young granddaughters. Since them my husband and I have started going.  One night I wanted to try something new and received a recommendation for the Panang which I had never tried. I am now a huge fan! 

The other night my husband want feeling well and got the flower soup, it was perfect and helped him get better, thank you."}
{"text":"We love the Thai House.  Food is excellent, service is fast, and the tab is reasonable.   We have had literally almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was a score! Everything we had was outstanding, we travel full time and eat alot of Thai Food and this was exceptional! 

Thanks for the great service and food."}
{"text":"Very good food and attentive service. Restaurant needs some work on its ambiance..that would make a significant difference to the dining experience."}
{"text":"My sister and I ate here before a movie so we were limited on time. The service was friendly, prompt and the place was imaculate. I had a cup of the Tom Yum something soup which has lemon grass in it--to die for! I also had a dish with chicken, red bell peppers and crisp green beans. That too was delicious. They make your food as mild or spicy as you like. Both of my dishes were just as I requested.

I highly recommend Thai House on Shea."}
{"text":"I ordered the Thai BBQ chicken and spent more time sifting tiny bone shards from my mouth than actually eating. I expected some bones, but this was as if they pounded it out with a hammer before cooking it. The amount of shattered bone slivers and pieces was extremely annoying. Aside from the food the place could use a good cleaning. 

Thai and Vietnamese food are the new hot trends in dining. Southeast Asian food is great! And there are many great Thai restaurants in the area. I'd like to see this place step it up and become competitive, but for me once is enough."}
{"text":"I tried to go to Shabu Grill but apparently they are in transistion to new management and was not open.... So Thai house here I come. 

The service was good as the server was patient and she came back around to refill water several times and to check in during our meal.

The food was good. I had the silver noodle salad and it was spicy for a 5, but I appreciate a Thai restaurant that is true to their spices. My friend had the pad Thai and I thought it was a bit too sweet and not spicy enough even though he had a 5 too.

Would I come back, yes, to try their other dishes before I make a final judgement. Plus they are close to my gym so it's convenient!"}
{"text":"Everyone that works here is just so smiley and nice you just feel compelled to order some food! I stopped by on my way home just to check out the menu, and ended up ordering the Orange Chicken and \"Rice Noodle Soup\" ( thin rice noodles with chicken, shrimp and bean sprouts in broth - similar to pho) and they were nothing too special, good quality food but just so-so. The flavor was 'fine' ... wasn't the best orange chicken I have tasted, but I was very impressed with the all-white meat - no knuckles here folks! 

I am used to a spicier Thai flavor, but I give them a 10 for their friendly customer service, a 10 for their smiles, and a 10 for kid friendliness. If you want to get your kids interested in eating something more exotic than McDonald's .. this is a great take-out place."}
{"text":"Quiet place.  Tucked away. Good food good service. Havent tried too many thai places but...The pad Thai and green curry were amazing. We had spicy level 3. It was good. Next time Im trying a 4."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I expected a little more from this place..... It was just ehhhh.....The Thai iced tea was good though, and the bbq chicken was better after I added the spicy chili flakes.  *might give this place another chance but not really counting on it,"}
{"text":"No change in rating.  Food continues to meet our expectations.

We have been using Tom Kha soup as a yardstick to compare food at other Thai restaurants and feel Thai House's has been consistently our favorite."}
{"text":"First, let's start with the online ordering: every place should have this capability. Now lets talk food: 
We ordered the chicken fried rice, curried duck, appetizer assortment platter, an order of sticky rice and a Thai iced coffee. Once inside and unpacked, the aroma wafting through my kitchen was nothing short of magical. The Chicken fried rice was for my husband, who has a limited pallet. I'm sure it was delicious, as he didn't complain. The duck curry was fall of the bone good. Just enough spice to cause, as we New Yorkers say, as schvitz. I enjoyed almost everything in the sampler except the egg/spring roll things. I just didn't care for those. My coffee was/is delightful. I will absolutely order from here again for several reasons: online ordering convenience, timely delivery, and the AMAZING FOOD!!"}
{"text":"One of a handful of Thai places in the valley serving authentic, fresh, handmade Thai food.  Virtually nothing here is not good.  The decor is lacking, but the service is excellent and the food will distract you from anything else.  Food is hypnotically good, and the prices are very good for the quantities they serve.  Great place for Thai food, must go."}
{"text":"Came in for an early dinner after playing a round of golf. Thai House is quite small and they have two other locations. 

The order Panang chicken curry, Pik King Pork and Pad Se Ew. The portions  here are over-sized but the quality is just average. The curry was the tastiest, Pik King also was average and the Pad Se Ew was under par.

The service here was good and the restaurant was clean. They charged for hot tea and steam rice also here a con in my opinion."}
{"text":"Yet another marvelous Thai restaurant found within the East Valley! My parents, aunt and myself feasted here on Valentine's Day for Linner. 

We ordered:

-Chicken Lo Mein
-Kung Pao Chicken
-Rad Nar with Pork
-Chicken with Mixed Vegetables 

Skipped the Appetizers as we all concurred that while tasty, they take up valuable 'real estate' in our bellies as well as detract from our main dishes. I was bummed that they didn't have any Thai or Vietnamese coffee, but in all honesty, I had no business with any caffeine this late in the day. 

Prices were pretty low (our bill was about $7 per person) and everyone came home with leftovers to devour later that night. 

Dining room is clean and serves its purpose - nothing amazing or too special. Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant!  It has wonderful food and great service. The only problem is trying to get in during rush hour!  They just expanded and still don't have enough seating."}
{"text":"Thai House is my favourite!  I've only ever got one thing from here that I did not like, thought it was a bit bland, it was the Pepper Steak.  Otherwise, all the curries are super yum!!!  This is my go to Thai craving!!!"}
{"text":"Place is always our first take out choice.  We always get the chicken fried rice which is amazing!!!! The crab ragoons and the red curry with chicken. Our all time favorite."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but nothing special in my opinion. I'd honestly be afraid to see what the kitchen looks like based on the decor and interior condition of the restaurant. Needs some work on the ambiance."}
{"text":"Mind blowing amazing curry, pad Thai, and Thai tea! I look forward to trying more things from the menu. I love that I can specify my spicy preference to each dish with a 1-5. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I eat at both of these restaurants locations on a regular basis.
Food is fabulous. I like consistent good food and this place delivers that 85% of the time.
I am very fond of the mussaman curry. I rarely stray.
But I have had and loved, panang, red and yellow curry.

BUT, I decided to try something different and got the tom ga Kai soup. 
I was in love!!! 

They just expanded the Pima road restaurant to accommodate the lunch and dinner flow.

Authentic Thai, reasonably priced. Two people can often share one bowl of curry, but it's too good to share and I'd rather have the leftovers for lunch the next day!
Don't forget the Thai iced tea. Sweet and wonderful!

Enjoy!  If you see my red motorcycle outside, come say hi to me!"}
{"text":"Place is good nothing to write home about my lo mein was a little Greasy but tasted good. The fried wontons where good and hot food came out super fast."}
{"text":"Always great to come here. Grea food, reasonable prices and the service is good. They also have a live band every other friday."}
{"text":"I am completely blown away by this restaurant! The dishes we ordered were INCREDIBLE! The place is very clean, and the service is great.  I am so happy this place is so close to home. I will definitely be returning to Thai House!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Perfect for take-out or a casual dinner out.  My faves are the yellow curry noodles, panang curry and pad thai.  Portions are huge.  If you do take-out, get extra rice to soak up all the yummy sauce.  The employees are friendly and the prices just right.  The food is always delish.  One of my favorite little finds."}
{"text":"I've been here two times for lunch and I have to say, their $6.99 lunch specials are incredible. For that price, you can get your choice of entree  (such as beef panang, sesame chicken or kung pao chicken) with a choice of either fried rice or white rice, a small (but delightfully crunchy) fried spring roll, a seemingly pointless chicken wing, and a small soup (which, as another yelper pointed out, is hard to describe as anything but weak, but remedied by chili sauce). I recommend the beef panang - you'll be blown away.

Service is speedy although not exactly \"friendly.\" Quick with refills on water and to clear finished plates, the two servers that I've had were extremely efficient. I find that in this city, servers fall into one of three categories: overly-friendly and attentive, making sure they are part of your dining \"experience\"; attentive but making themselves more part of the background and allowing the food to make-or-break the meal; and downright rude. I would say the ladies who have served me here fall into the second category, and perhaps with their traditional Thai wardrobe, they are meant to be more part of the environment as a whole than overshadow it.

I'll update sometime after I visit during dinner - or who knows, even karaoke one of these weekend nights."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the food here in every meal that we have gotten over the years is great."}
{"text":"Take-out and delivery experience was excellent. Food came warm and early. Pad Thai was surprisingly hot (as requested) and flavorful. Veg rolls were enormous. Definitely going to be ordering from Thai House again soon."}
{"text":"Go to this Thai place once a week for the lunch special. The food is good not great but you get soo much of it. Egg roll, chicken wing, and soup and that's before you get your entree. You can't beat it."}
{"text":"I just left there.. My bf found this place and came because of the ratings. It's mediocre at best. The service wasn't good or bad. The servers seemed stressed. But it was probably because it's so packed. Barely room to walk. And it didn't feel clean. Too crowded for me to enjoy my food or conversation. The food came out at a decent time. But not the best. I had the yellow curry and it lacked flavor. All I tasted was the thick coconut milk. My bfs beef pad Thai dish seemed like it needed more tlc. Flavor was ok. Tom yum soup was ok.. over all.. probably will not go back unless I'm in the area and really really craving Thai food."}
{"text":"As far as food quality, taste, and price goes you can't beat this place. Been going here for years and whenever I am out of town (I spend 1/2 my year abroad) all I do is think about the next time I can order from here. I have tried Thai restaurants all over the world, and with the exception of the homeland, nothing does it quite like Thai House. One thing though, if you order take out ALWAYS check your order. I always seem to have something missing. That being said, when I have gotten home and been dissatisfied they have brought me the correct order at no cost."}
{"text":"I grew up eating authentic Thai Food and Pad Thai is one of my all time favorite dishes. Thai House has some of the best Pad Thai I've ever had! It's the dish I use to judge a Thai restaurants authenticity and they hit the nail right on the head. I can't wait to go back and try some different entrees!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on our recent trip to Las Vegas.  I ordered curry and DH ordered Lemon Chicken.  Mine was ok, but nothing special.  DH's Lemon Chicken wasn't fully cooked, so that was a turn off.   Don't plan on returning to this restaurant.  Service was mediocre, even though they weren't busy."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice and was disappointed both times. The food is very underwhelming. I ordered the Pad Thai and my husband ordered a curry dish. The prices are a little high for how mediocre the food is."}
{"text":"I can't decide...3 or 4 stars???

service is probably what is going to push it up to four.

This place has the best Thai Tea that i've had up north. This is what sets it apart for me.

Their spice is a full heat, NOT a pinpoint, kill you, unenjoyable pain.

We always get Pa-Nang when we eat Thai. This place has one to rival some of our favorite places in town.

I would love to come back and see if they were a good or bad fluke the time we went."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky about my Thai and I love Thai food, and I have to say the Tom Yum soup here is FANTASTIC and totally passed the test. Also, I really enjoyed the red curry. The ginger beef dish was decent, and I really liked the pineapple fried rice. Yes, I came here a couple times this week - especially since I was \"home\" (at the hotel) sick one day this week. As a San Friscan (where Thai food is aplenty), I'll vouch for Thai House. ;-)"}
{"text":"Oh Thai House, you crazy. When we first walked in at 11:30am, the Thai House was packed. No seating anywhere, except for the three seats at the tiny bar. We grabbed those chairs and held on tightly. (Good thing too since a line started to form at the door!) During our entire time here, the three servers were swamped! They were continuously running back and forth between the kitchen, cash register, and dining tables. It was a mad house! 

Luckily, it didn't take much time to order or receive our food. This place is very efficient. We ordered the lunch specials - Pad Thai for me and panang chicken for my husband. Holy moly, so much food! Not only do you get your dish, but you get a side of fried rice or white rice, and either soup or salad. We both opted for fried rice and soup. The soup was egg drop and while it was good, I thought it needed salt. I loved the fried rice - it had the normal mix-ins (egg, carrot, peas) but the flavor was really good. My Pad Thai was good as well, but there was so much that I have lunch for tomorrow. My husband liked his panang chicken and ate every bite. Between us, we shared a Thai iced tea. It tasted like the Thai iced tea I had at Osha Thai, which is good. I'm sad Thai House doesn't have Thai Iced Coffee, but I'll get over it. We had a great meal that was pretty inexpensive, especially since there's left overs. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is yummy in my tummy! The Panang Curry is fantastic.  They can make the heat up to \"20.\"  Thats when the fun really starts.  Their Pineapple Curry is freaking awesome.  Their Spicy Drunken noodles are so good you will want to lick the plate clean.  These are my top 3 dishes. 
The food is exceptionally prepared.  Just try to get there before the lunch or Friday Dinner rushes."}
{"text":"I had the Pad Thai with chicken and my fiancé had the Yellow Curry with chicken... both were amazing! We don't have Thai food where we live so every time we head to the PHX area we try a different Thai place and this was definitely our favorite! We will be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place for years. Thai curry and hot Thai soups are always good. I especially like the Tom Yum.

This is the perfect place for lunch. I go during my lunch hour and get a great inexpensive item on the lunch menu and make it back to work before my lunch hour is over.

It's great too because they have take-out so I just call up first and pick it up."}
{"text":"Food good service and management is HORRIBLE!!!!! The cooks messed up my entire order. They said I could have a credit then when I called to honor that they told me it was my fault and wouldn't honor it.. seriously??? So they gave me wrong spice on everything and a wrong size soup and refused to fulfill the order which they charged me for!!! Would recommend staying far away from these crooks!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best green coconut curry I've had in a long time. In many ways better then what I ate in Thailand! Very reasonably priced for big portions."}
{"text":"Good basic place. Looks like they just opened as there's no decor.  I had Pad Woon Sen and it was very good. They do not serve beer here which is fine but maybe they don't have their liquor permit yet."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai restaurant I have ever eaten at. It's a little pricy but really worth it. The food is fresh and authentic. 
It has one of the best mango sticky rice I have ever had, and I spent 6 months in Thailand. 
If you like Thai food it's a must."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Panang Curry dish in all of Arizona. It is awesome! My wife loves the Pad Thai as well."}
{"text":"Easy online ordering. I ordered the pad Thai and pot stickers for pick up.
The workers seemed very confused on who ordered what and who was there to pick orders-- needs organization. They helped others before helping me and I had been standing in line first.
The food was probably some of the worst Thai food ive had. The pad Thai was SO dry and unflavorful, I evn asked for EXTRA spicy. It was not spicy at all! The pot sticks poured out water upon biting or cutting into them, disgusting! 
I will not be going back nor will I ever recommend ppl to eat there."}
{"text":"This place is straight B-O-M-B! If you haven't tried it yet, then you're missing out on some incredibly delicious Thai food. Now, I'm not on e to rave about how great a dish is, but every time I come here I alway order a particular dish. If you're big fan of pork, then strap your seat belts and get ready cause this will be the best pork dish you ever had. Are you ready for it? (*drum roll please*) it's the deep fried pork belly with Chinese broccoli. Regardless of the season or day, the flavor for this dish remains the same. It's salty yet mildly sweet flavor pork stir fried with a crunchy tasting Chinese brocolli, is almost too good to pass up when ordering. I'm also a big fan of their beef pad seew, the flavor is ground breaking mixed with scrambled egg and Chinese broccoli sautéed with the thick cut noodles and that incredible sauce, this review is making me salivate at the thought of it. The curry here is amazing too, my personal favorite is the green curry and the yellow curry, both served with white rice makes the dish seem almost complete. 

The service here isn't too bad, and they have no problems when it comes to splitting the check. The interior decoration seems Thai like, it has that Asia sense feel to it. The tables are good to fit a big party, and once you arrive you're sat down almost immediately. Drop by here if you can, I promise you.....you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant and everyone who comes with me enjoys it as well.  My favorite is yellow curry chicken and surprisingly their tofu soup is very good!  I'm not usually a soup person, but I now look forward to the tofu soup before the entree.  Tried the wonton soup and don't recommend it.  The lunch specials during the week are a great deal, as others have mentioned."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been open for about 7 months in my old 'hood in Scottsdale in the Sonora shopping mall off the 101 and FLW between the Best Buy and Staples. The restuarant has a sister location in Mesa.
The owners are Thai.
 
The decor is clean, neat, almost quaint, and without a lot of Thai decorative influences. They do play a sort of Ttradional Thai melodies meets New Age Relaxation type CD, and it is relaxing. 

I came for lunch. They run 10 lunch specials for $6.95, which includes a side salad of romaine and carrot strips with a light soy/sesame dressing. To satisfy the mostly Caucasian Scottsdale neighborhood, the choices are part Chinese (Orange Chicken, Kung Pao), Japanese (Chicken Teriyaki) and Thai (Pad Thai, Panang).

I had Panang Chicken curry, which came with your choice of fried or steamed rice (steamed Jasmine). The curry comes in your preferred spice level from 1 to 5. Pick 3, which is about right for most. The curry had a nice flavor, with nice small pieces of chicken with juliened red bell peppers. I added a Thai iced tea to drink for $2. 

They have the usual colors of curries, all about $10, soups like Tom Yum Koong, Salads like Yum Woon Sen, Larb, and Papaya, and noodles like Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, and Rad Nar. 

A bit Americanized, but tasty and very reasonable. There are few choices for Thai in Scottsdale, so if you have craving, try this one."}
{"text":"It was just ok. The Tom yum soup was pretty flavorful but very lukewarm. Crab fried rice was very disappointing - it's too wet and lack the flavor. Bok Choy was a bit salty. Calamari appetitizer was probably the only decent thing - but my friends didn't enjoy that. We ordered hot tea - and they brought out 3 huge bottles for each of us!!! (Of course they charge for each bottle!) the decor was nice though but not enough to keep me coming back. Sorry but I've had much better Thai food elsewhere"}
{"text":"Very slow service.  Waitress not as attentive as needed to be on a slow night.  Our apps, drinks and entrees all came out at same time.  App was $9 and only got 5 pcs of shrimp with a few vegetables, she forgot our bowl of rice, lemon, and our bill at end.  Food was not great.  I went here 7 yrs ago and service was excellent.  I bought 2 Groupons, visiting a total of three times in past 2 yrs and now all times were not acceptable.  If App portions were larger and serve better, I would go back.  But they r consistently bad, not worth $45 per 2 people."}
{"text":"If we are just talking about the food here, then it's all good. I haven't had a bad dish yet. They have a cheap lunch special that fills you up. Thai tea and coffee are yummy. They have a speedy delivery service. However, it is time to redo the menus. When we dine in, the menus are so old and crusty I don't even want to touch them. They are falling apart, have old food particles on then, stick together, and still list dishes they no longer serve and haven't served for a while. I would love to say the decor is delightfully tacky, but it's not. It's just plain tacky. If they removed some of the clutter and spent a little to spruce things up, it would breathe new life in here. But I digress, because the food is in fact good."}
{"text":"The food is pretty consistent, except this location seems to have a lot of flies which worries me.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Great food! My lady had the chicken fried rice which was awesome. I had the green curry which was really good. Not the best I've ever had but really good. And it was alot of food too. I love leaving with left overs :)"}
{"text":"Off their game tonight. Ordered 4 main dishes for carry out, including pad se ew with TOFU, but they gave me chicken instead which was hard and dry.  Ordered pad Thai and Kung pao both with chicken, and flavors were good, but again chicken was rubbery. Panang with chicken was good.  Ordered (& charged for) 2 extra rice, but they forgot it.  I generally have had 4 star experience here, but not tonight."}
{"text":"Glad to see they were open today.   Spicy beef salad was delicious.  Spring rolls and chicken noodles.  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here again. This time service was a little bizarre. I think there may have been a slight language barrier. She got the entire parties' order correct and was pleasant but was just a little slow. 

We ordered 4 dishes and shared it family style. Every dish was delicious and the appetizers were great. We had the shrimp and a cream cheese something or other."}
{"text":"Great place for large groups. We had a group of 20 people and they were able to accommodate us. The food here is so good... I will defiantly be returning. I never really craved for Thai food but after eating here I want it again . I ordered pineapple fried rice, crab rangoon, beef pad thai, and beef ball noodle soup... all were fantastic.

Crab Rangoon was well presented and fully stuffed and crispy on the outer wrap. Delicious.

Beef Pad Thai delicious as always.

Beef ball noodle soup was also delicious!

Pineapple fried rice was my favorite! So flavorful and the cashews really added a nice savory crunch.

Defiantly will be returning!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been here for awhile since we a decent Thai restaurant where we live. Took our daughters roommate for his birthday and we were pleasantly surprise.
We ordered the fresh Spring Rolls to start and they were great with the minty after taste that some places ignore. We had the Pad Thai, Panang curry dish, Pad Se Ew and the Tom Yum Koong soup. 
Let me tell you, the flavors in all the dishes 'were through the roof'. Everything we tried was amazing. I think the hotest dish was the Panang and it was really good (lvl 3 in hotness) and was bearable. Our other dishes where in the level 2 range and, for me, just the right amount of kick. 
The Tom Yum soup had plenty of shrimp as well as the Panang which had loads of chicken. My Pad Thai had lots of pork. This place does not skimp on their protein.
We followed our meal with Mango with sticky rice.
That was a great dinner experience."}
{"text":"Very happy with the food here. The soups were great and so were the two noodle dishes.  Prices were very reasonable.  Would definitely go again if in the area."}
{"text":"I used to live in the Henderson area and randomly saw this golden find. Happy to say that trying it once landed me a go-to place for my Thai fix! 

Thai House Restaurant is a very nice, intimate spot. I would consider it almost like fine dining (wine-type glasses for water and cloth napkins), yet with affordable pricing. Thai House is the first Thai restaurant I tried when I moved to Las Vegas in September 2014, and it is so good that I refuse to waste my time trying anything else! I've had their papaya salad, yellow curry, and pad thai-- all amazing. Plus, on top of high-quality, delicious food, their customer service is outstanding! I've been here five times and within every visit, I'm seated immediately with water served/drink orders taken right away. The food comes out very quickly too, and they check on you multiple times to make sure everything is ok, then are quick to replenish your needs (as all great servers should do). 

Side note: most of their entrees are spiced from 1-10. I have a very low tolerance for spicy food, so if you are like me but want a tiny kick, a 2 should suffice."}
{"text":"Very good food! The pot stickers were incredible, I thoroughly enjoyed the pineapple curry. Service is fast and efficient! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Thai House is a great place to grab some reliably delicious Thai food at great prices. My favorites are the broccoli with beef and the veggie mix with beef. The staff is very friendly, service is VERY fast (take-out, esp.) and the food never disappoints. They can also make a healthier dish, if requested, with less sauce than normally used. 

Also, they use two scales of spice... American Spicy and Thai Spicy.. when they ask how hot you want your food on scale of 1-5... you can actually order 5 and above... but beware! Thai Spicy is HOT! I am usually on the mild-medium side of the spice world and a 2-3 is perfect for me. Any spicier and I can't enjoy it. My boyfriend, on the other hand, orders a 12 and loves it. To each his own :-)

The restaurant is small but comfortable and it is usually quiet in the evenings. If you love Thai, you should definitely add Thai House to your rotation."}
{"text":"Thai House is the bomb! Their Panang Curry is fantastic. Also ordered the spicy noodle and kung pao chicken. They modify the spice to your liking. It's a bit hard to find in that huge and endless shopping area, so just look for the Party City. Prices are very reasonable and both times I ordered take out, my wait was only 15 min. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Well I wanted to give this a better review (I promise I did), but after too many hit or misses I won't be going back. 

The first time I ordered from here I got the spicy chicken, mint & basil dish and it was simply superb. So were the crab rangoons. 

The next time I ordered from here I ordered the same dish. This time is was so salty that I couldn't even enjoy it. Not to mention that most of the broth from the dish had spilled into the delivery bag.

I figured this was a fluke, so I ordered the same dish for a third time (yes, I'm a creature of habit) and kindly let them know that it was too salty the last time. Their solution was to not add ANY seasoning. Omgosh- no. It was like eating water, but sweet water because I guess to make SURE it wasn't too salty they added sugar? *face palm*

Then I figured I'd give them one last chance and try a different dish: Thai fried rice. *sigh*

After waiting for over an hour for my food to arrive, when it finally came it tasted like basic fried rice that one would get from Panda Express. Not a drop of thai flavoring at all. 

Unfortunately I had to flush it down the toilet....along with the menu."}
{"text":"Clean, tasty, fast, fresh, comfortable, bright and friendly. Great for a quick lunch. Address misleading: it's down southbound SR101 Frontage Rd from Frank Lloyd Wright, behind Wendy's, then right, past Best Buy.

--small dining room looks great after the remodel
--lunch specials make it easy for those \"stimulus\" menu diners
--extremely fast service gets you in and out in 20 minutes if you're in a rush, and it's full service
--spicy hotness scaled from 1-5, though 5 barely caught my attention
--request for \"oil/vinegar\" brought small cup of distilled vinegar. ew.
--fried rice not made to order, but who can beat the price?"}
{"text":"They screwed up my take out order and when I told them about it, they got all pissy and ruffled. I think I will look for a different place next time I want thai.  The food was sub-par and they don't listen all that well in regards to take out orders."}
{"text":"Food is sometimes really good and sometimes not so good. I think its in the sauce. When my curry sauce is thick and not watered down its flavorful. Chicken fried rice is pretty much always good. Its also really hard to communicate with some of the staff if you want to call in a food order."}
{"text":"The food here is great, for that I would give 5 stars.  But my latest experience with Thai House has left me a little less than satisfied with their service.  We ordered for delivery and the estimated time for delivery at 11am on a Saturday was 60-80 minutes. Long but doable.  At 90 minutes I requested an update to my delivery and they said the driver would be on the way shortly, we don't live far so he arrived about 5 minutes later as if he had just been sent when I called.  When I asked what kind of discount or way they were going to make it right, they insisted that the delivery was in the estimated time and refused to do anything.  The driver even apologized for being late so they clearly knew they were in the wrong.  Not thrilled about their customer service and that is the reason for the rating of 3 stars."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have ever had. It's absolutely delicious. My family comes here a lot and we have never been disappointed with our food. We often get their pad thai because it has a lot of flavor, and their panang curry because it' absolutely to die for. 

The only downside is that customer service can be a bit dodgy sometimes, but the food definitely makes up for it."}
{"text":"My wife goes here for the lunch special at least once a week.  So I had to try it out myself!

We stopped in together, a while ago, and had their lunch combo special.  She got the Pad Thai with tofu, with a level 4 in their level of spiciness.  I did the same thing, but went with chicken and a level 5.
 The level 5 wasn't all that spicy, in my opinion.  And the \"salad\" that came with the lunch special was not very impressive.

Last night, on the way home, my wife picked up dinner, to go.  She got the same Pad Thai (creature of habit) and I tried the Spicy Noodles.  I must say, the portions were HUGE!  Enough for left overs tonight.

I must say, I have a whole new appreciation for the level 5 spicy!  It was fabulously flavor-filled noodles of FIRE!!  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work and have eaten a lot of pad Thai from all over the country... This is the best I've ever had. I could ear it every day. I always say if I move from northeast Ohio and come back to visit, this is a place I need to eat at. The curry dishes are tasty as well."}
{"text":"Sorry this isn't good nor authentic thai food. Tried the beef salad. Not very good at all and they use low quality beef. I suppose some of the westernized type dishes that aren't real thai are ok. But this place is a joke"}
{"text":"Thai House is one of those restaurants that isn't afraid to flavor and spice the food the way it should be which immediately gives it two thumbs up. The fresh spring rolls had alot of flavor and probably the best I have had in a long time. The fried egg rolls were good but not great like the spring rolls. I sampled three entrees -- shrimp pad thai, beef kee mow and chicken pad see ew. The pad thai was perfectly cooked and prepared with a very fresh and flavorful taste but to my taste it was a little lacking in tamarind. The kee mow didn't shy away from taste or flavor with tender beef, al dente noodles and a nice kick to warm up the mouth. The pad see ew was nearly the best I have ever had with a huge amount of flavor and a kick not often seen at most restaurants. The wide noodles were perfectly cooked, vegetables were firm, and the meet was nicely tender and flavorful. It was hard to stop eating it was so good.

 If I were rating on food along Thai House would get 5 stars. However, the service was a bit lacking with less than attentive server and the server wanted to charge us extra for a little (I mean about two teaspoons) peanut sauce to go. The restaurant is very clean, well lit and comfortable but the waterfall was pretty but on the loud side and had the faint smell of chlorine which is a bit of a turn off. 

Even with these deficiencies I will add Thai House to my favorites list if only for the awesome Thai food."}
{"text":"Great spot for Thai take-out.  Love the Pad Thai and Green Curry.  Great prices for great food and good hearty portions.  Always have enough for multiple meals."}
{"text":"People seem to be complaining about the service, but my boyfriend and I always get food to go from here and it's very tasty! It's one of our dinner go-to's when we can't decide what we want to do. Pretty good prices and big portions--we usually get pad thai and papaya salad, or some combo of a noodle and salad dish. I will continue to go here."}
{"text":"Never disappointed no matter what I order.  However my favorites include #35 with chicken  (never beef) spicy level 3 (not that hot).  Also #40 with chicken  (never beef) spicy level 3 is a great companion."}
{"text":"Have driven in this shopping center for years now and finally tried Thai House, really happy to have finally tried it, amazing yellow curry, yet to get through entire menu, but will try something new next time.  Very reasonable price, and very busy at the lunch hour but they do offer lunch special which is the way to go!  For Thai we now go to the Thai House!  Get the Thai Ice T also!"}
{"text":"Decent Thai food but not my favorite on town, very bland flavors despite asking for very spicy and meats have a rubbery consistency."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai Food. We ALWAYS get it to go. Our food is already ready in the time they say it will be and it's fresh. We love it!"}
{"text":"Omg! I have to say this is my second time eating here and it has completely blew me away! The first time was average and I wanted to give it another try and I'm so glad I did. I ordered the sweet and sour beef. Lunch special. I know! Beef! Where do you get sweet n sour beef! At least I've never seen? Only chicken, pork or shrimp. And I ordered the chicken potstickers appetizers. When you get the lunch special it's so much food! I received one pot sticker and one eggroll! If I would have dine in. I would have gotten a bowl of soup! It feed me and my son abundantly. He cleared his plate and I still had left overs. I'm so going here again just cuz of the beef! I picked the food up to take home and they are so friendly and nice! Great job guys! You have a future customer and I'll tell everyone about you! Thank you for being down the street and I'll be back to try other things if this was so good. Im sure a lot of other things are too!"}
{"text":"They took an order on grubhub but decided they were too busy to deliver.  They didn't notify grubhub nor I the customer.  Just let me sit around for 2 hours. Will never in a million years give this place another try

Oh, and grubhub gave me a whopping $5 for my inconvenience.  won't even cover delivery fees"}
{"text":"7/26/12

If you're looking for atmosphere, you won't find it here.  It's also very loud (I went during lunch hours), and you're most likely going to have to wait, unless you come during the tail-end of lunch.  (There's a sign posted on the wall by the door that stated to the effect that for those customers who did not want to or could not wait, then please visit Narai Thai and Sushi down a few doors.  To some people, it might come off as abrupt, and even slightly rude, but I thought that was generous of Thai House to post...  Both places are good, and Narai Thai has atmosphere.)   What you will find are a great Chicken panang http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#x0sI8WU7hgYveO5nGEFk1A and a terrific bowl of Curry noodles!! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JdtJ3jmMukLXU-gDjVTEgg?select=UMYl4OVwixbiNkHhZM1P2Q#RDHeNq9Ld9h5-6imL9WDRg  The curries here are rich and very silky-- just how I prefer them!  The Thai iced tea I had was also very, very good (not too sweet).  What I didn't like was that the lunch specials only featured the entree and your choice of soup/salad and steamed white/fried rice.  No egg roll.  Probably a healthier option, but still... :(  I didn't care for the salad dressing, a sweet vinaigrette.  Next time, I'm going to specify dry.  

What really sealed the deal here for me was the service!  I cannot wait to go back and try the other menu items!"}
{"text":"The BEST Thai restaurant! My favorite place. Stuffs are very friendly, nice and tradional. I love it!! I live far from here but my travel to go here just to eat is worth!! Food is great! Love it love it. I Definitely recommend this place. If you like thai food this is the best place to go! Cherry is our server and shes the best server and very knowledgeable with foods."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great service, and great price.

We always get the Tom Yum soup with Shrimp (level 6). Best Tom Yum in town. 

For entrees, we usually stick with the Pad Thai with Chicken and Moo Goo Gai. 

Have ordered delivery a couple times, food was good and delivery speedy."}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this restaurant for about 10 years. We would eat here on almost all occasions. They let us have a party before and use the stage to sing as well. I would rate the food about 3.5-4 stars depending on what you get. Fried rice and Pad Thai haven't disappointed so far. 5 stars for service because the waitresses are always extremely nice and they're pretty fast on bringing the food out. Cleanliness of the restaurant and the quiet ambiance of the place is a plus. I love their lunch specials! It's pretty cheap for all the food you get. Overall, 4 stars.

However, I'm going to have to rate it 3 stars now from what happened yesterday. It was a rainy day so we thought it would be cool to just get the food delivered for the first time. It took about an hour and that's pretty early for them because they said it should take 1-1.5 hours. Ouch...worst decision ever since we live down the street. They charge $5 to deliver. All of those are still pretty understandable. I got 2 orders of Chicken Pad Thai over the phone and she repeated the order clearly to confirm it. However, they ended up delivering 2 orders of Chicken Satay and one order of Chicken Pad Thai. At this point, I'm crawling on the floor from starvation and all the frustration, but I still have to be considerate because it was an honest mistake. I called to let them know what happened. The girl on the phone was really nice and was sorry but her boss clearly said that they want us to return the 2 orders of Chicken Satay back. Umm okay? Are they going to recycle it and give it to a different customer? That was extremely odd. 30 minutes later, the delivery man came back to give us the other order of Chicken Pad Thai. He took back the other 2 orders of Chicken Satay and opened the boxes to check if we touched or ate any! What is up with that? There was no accommodations made except for fixing the charges on my credit card. They acted like it was our mistake and did it on purpose. I just hope that they don't give the food that we returned to a different customer since they were so determined to take it back and make sure that it was untouched. 1 star for the experience but it was the first time it happened and they have been so good to me for years, so 3 stars overall."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!!!
This is amazing food. Local and fresh. Real Thai food and no huge overpriced items. We wanted GOOD food no matter what price but it wasn't happening at the resort we were staying at so I went to yelp and read the past reviews. 
They were all right on target.  Food is fabulous, price is great, portions are great. We were seated and served in a timely manner. I had chicken with yellow curry. Creamy currie was best I've had so far in all my Arizona searching. 
Next time I'm in scottsdale I WIIL BE BACK!!"}
{"text":"I believe all families have a restaurant that they frequently go to. It's considered the \"usual\". You know what I mean, that place that becomes not only a dining experience, but a family tradition where random dinners or celebrations take place. Memories are build and as a result, a soft spot is grown in one's heart. Hate to sound cheesy, but it's true. And for my family, Thai House became that place in Las Vegas. 

Thai House delivers good food in a somewhat campy environment. Despite having the same cuisine as Pin Kaow, Thai House isn't clad in sleek design and intimate lighting. Instead, you have a mini dance floor, television screens promoting karaoke, and tacky decorations. I always see the same friendly hostess, who is kinda loud and recognizes us. She seems to have the best grasp of the English language and handles a lot of the front dining. Fun fact:  my family came in during a session where an elderly man in a Hawaiian shirt was singing 80's love ballads. Awkward and hilarious at the same time. Such caveats might cause people to leave, but I've learned to embrace the ridiculousness and just roll with it. 

As for the food, my favorite dishes are their curries, papaya salad (of course), and crispy chicken. They definitely follow the mantra \"the more, the better\". But I think for the most part, the food is delicious. MSG haters/phobics might want to avoid this place, I can't recall if they had a message on their menu regarding this issue. But you should still give it a shot. Who knows, you might see the same old man covering Mariah Carey's \"Hero\"."}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was a little strange. It looked like they had a big event at the same time we came in for lunch. It took a while to get our check because all of the waitresses were cleaning up from the party. 

Honestly, there weren't any other customers in the place as we were eating a late lunch. I'm not really sure if the waitresses just forgot about us or what.

All in all, I'll be going back, but it isn't any place that blew my mind."}
{"text":"RED ALERT: 
I have been coming here for well over 10 years, maybe more . Stopped by today just to order some War Wonton soup to go. It had been a while.  Decided to relax and enjoy some hot Saki . Not once did I get a smile, hello, or anything positive during my whole experience. Awful. Actually thought I was at a funeral.....nobody was smiling....maybe something was going on this day. Who knows....
The Saki arrived cold and I had to send it back. Decided to order the meatball side dish while I waited.....it was awful....the worst tasting piece of meat I have ever had......
The soup was so so  Put a bunch of stuff in a pot.....no attention to flavor at all...
I used to really enjoy this place.....but I don't think I will ever come back....really sad.
I just  don;t think they give a shit anymore..........
So close to where I live....but then again, so many other choices...."}
{"text":"This place is right by my house so I have been their quite a few times.  I typically get the same few things everytime I go and they never dissapoint.  It is really pretty authentic and the prices are average.  What I get there that I love is the chicken panang, chili mint chicken, and tom yum goong  soup.  All very good.  If it was far away I probably wouldnt go out of my way to go there, but it is definitely a good place if it is nearby."}
{"text":"So my cousins and I went to work out. I failed miserably at creeping on girls at the LVAC on Eastern/215 location. I suggested we grub on some Thai food.

This was not our first choice, I think Surang was but it was closed down for the mean time. So we're on our way to this place and I notice that the area we're heading to is near my ex-gf's place. 

I looked it up on Yelp and see that it's Chinese (SLASH) Thai food so I immediately started getting negative feelings about it.

We get there and guess what? Yes, you were right! This was the last place me and my ex-gf had last seen each other. That was a wonderful day so all the negativity went away.

We eat our food and that didn't change. It was ok. I wish I would have went to Archi's. If it was less pricey, I'd be ok with it. Plus they didn't advertise Coconut Juice!!! What the hell? I love Coconut Juice. Whack.

This was like watching the Sixth Sense for the 3rd time. YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO GO DOWN.

Not  as good as Passion of the Christ and definitely not better than Lethal Weapon 4."}
{"text":"Finally!! A good place to get Thai food in the area! I've been looking all over and reluctantly decided to eat here after recently trying some other less than average Thai food places in the area. However, I'm very impressed with Thai House and plan to return in the future! Reasonably priced, good portion size, good service, delicious food! I called ahead and my order was ready within about 10 minutes. I had ordered Spicy Noodles with chicken to go at a 3 star spice level. I expected it to be slightly spicier but the dish was full of flavor and was still amazing. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai place!!!! 
We ways get the pad se ew and charbroiled chicken , but their tom yum goong is awesome too . We're never disappointed with their food !"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Thai place (close to my house) I love their yellow curry and the Thai jerky is amazing. We dined here for the first time last night (we usually have their food delivered to us) and the atmosphere was nice - their Saturday entertainment we definitely could have done without but that's neither here nor there. The house was packed, but the servers never faltered once. Service was great and the food was excellent per the usual"}
{"text":"I use to come here on a daily, but then the prices started to raise and they started to charge me for white rice on every refill.. I haven't been in for a while due to that so I decided today i craved it. & now I think that's the last I'll do a take out from here. Not only was my order wrong, but my food was not appetizing at all. I ordered a pad see eww shrimp & chicken larb. Not even a small rice was given. On top of that my total was almost 30 bucks for just that & my larb was dry, no flavor what so ever just the spices. I don't think I'll be back for another while again . Very disappointed.."}
{"text":"Fresh food, can choose level of hotness ( Thai hot 1-5), delicious curries. Great for lunch, a quick bite, or takeout.

Green curry with chicken is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Update! We were craving thai curry so we decided to call thai house. We wanted something new, we tried the green curry 5 spicyness with brown rice. 

The green was better than the yellow. The server on the phone told us that the green was spicier than the yellow and we she right on the  money. 

Next time we are gonna try the red curry. But the green was pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I used to live a few blocks away from here and I have to say I love this place. I usually get the same things shrimp fried rice spicy #5 and crab rangoons. But we've gone thru the menu a few times. Food is very good and the ladies who work there are very nice and are on top of the refills. We now drive 20-30 mins to pick up food from here."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! Was in the area and craving Asian food yesterday, and boy they did not disappoint! Their fried glass noodles (Pad Woon Sen I believe) and stir fried eggplant were my favorite dishes, there was only one waiter there at the time but he was quick and had great attitude, all in all great service and food, looking forward to bringing my family here and have them try it out soon!"}
{"text":"Who charges extra to get a drink with easy ice??? This is not right. And they don't even tell you until the bill comes. The food was good. Got the pad Thai, green curry, and Tom kha soup. Everything was pretty sweet. Just a heads up seems like they put sugar in everything."}
{"text":"I don't live close by and had a meeting at a near by location. Me and a few co workers decided to try this place. The food was great! I ordered the panang curry with tofu and a side of brown rice. The tofu pieces we were very large for my liking (may be u can ask them to cut it into smaller pieces? ). The portion was huge. And the taste was fantastic. It was neither too thick nor too watery. Just the right amount of veggies (I realized how imp this is a few hours back when I ordered the same dish in another restaurant) . I also ordered the Thai iced tea , which was perfect for my taste ( just the right amount of sweet and freshly brewed tea!). My co workers also enjoyed their food ( I do not rem what they ordered). All in all an excellent place for Thai cuisine. I will probably drive all the way from Tempe once just to eat here again :)."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to explain how great this place is. Thai food is my favorite and I've had it home cooked by Thai natives as well as in amazing SF restaurants. This place is up there! There were 4 of us so we ordered 3 dishes to split- red curry, pad thai, pad kee mao. Each one was sooooo finger licking good. Their thai iced tea wasn't watered down one bit and wasn't overloaded with ice either. Nothing is skimpy about this place. We had tons of leftovers left. I will make this a definite stop when in the area!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from the Yelp app. Food arrived way before the time it said which was awesome! The restaurant called me after I placed my order to confirm my order was correct which was nice. Food was hot when it arrived and everything was right. 

I ordered the fried bananas, war wonton soup, steamed pot stickers and the Thai style sweet and sour chicken everything was hot and delicious! One thing to note is be careful when ordering the sweet and sour chicken because Thai style the chicken isn't breaded which I liked but some people might get the two options they have mixed up.

I definitely recommend this place and I will order from them again!"}
{"text":"I was worried the food would be subpar. Boy was I wrong!!! Want an amazing culinary experience that will blow your mind... look no further!!! Thai House is worth every bite!!!"}
{"text":"Since there are already a ton of reviews about this place I'm going to keep it short. 

The coconut chicken soup is so friggin delicious, you'll want to smack the person sitting next to you."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to Arizona from California we haven't found a single even halfway decent Thai restaurant. Thai house is just a little spot in a strip mall but the food was good quality and the portions were more than generous. Felt good to finally get some Thai food in Scottsdale that felt halfway authentic."}
{"text":"Great food and they deliver!  We've only had delivery once and eaten in the restaurant once so far.  The food is good, the prices are good.  Delivery was pretty quick.  Service at the restaurant was a little slow though.

I don't remember which curries everyone has had from here, but they loved them.  The spice levels are apparently a little low for your typical 1 (wimpy) to 10 (flaming) range from what everyone else told me, so I guess order just a little warmer than your first instinct would tell you.  Other than everyone mentioning (both times we've eaten their food) the heat could have gone up one more notch, they raved about how good it was.  I have only had the pad thai (I know, not so adventurous, but comfor food was calling) so far and it was great too."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Service is great and fast and the girls are so sweet.  Food is great too!  I've spent a lot of time in Thailand so i'm a little critical but this place does the trick!"}
{"text":"Extremely disrespectful workers is one description
My family and I came here from after a friend referred this Thai restaurant to us. The food took a long time for arrival,and and was cold. The lady who served us even admitted to us that all she used was a microwave when we told her about the cold rice. All we can say is it is our first and last visit, It was such a tense and uncomfortable environment too. No Thank You."}
{"text":"My wife was feeling under the weather so I looked for takeout near the South Point where we were staying and found this Thai/Chinese restaurant.  The restaurant was both sparsely decorated and patronized early on a Friday evening.  I stuck with the basics and ordered pad Thai and spicy chili mint chicken.  Neither dish was very authentic or good, but the food served to fill our bellies.  There are better options within a few miles."}
{"text":"Best Thai Food!!
Red Chicken Curry is my favorite!! 
It's so hard to find good curry! 3 spice! 

It's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Update: I had to take a couple stars away based on my most recent experience at Thai House...my entree was blander than normal and the mango sticky rice was a major disappointment--the mango had been frozen!"}
{"text":"The pad Thai is tremendous and the owners are great people. Could use a face-lift and the dining room updated but the food is great"}
{"text":"Great food great service! I've taken multiple friends here and have recommended it to lots of others who enjoy authentic Thai food! Love Thai House!"}
{"text":"Got to go from here a while back. Food wasn't even very edible. Scarfed down about a handful as we were starving and then gave up. Glad we gave up because everyone's stomach started hurting not long after. Think cheap mall steam table food that's sat out for too long and you'll know exactly what to expect."}
{"text":"Amazing food, for those of you who like spice make sure you get higher then a 5 (goes up to 20)"}
{"text":"Not the best Thai food I've ever had...but the service is excellent, the portions great for the price and overall the taste is excellent. MUCH better food here than the much more upscale and MUCH more expensive \"King and I\".
We've been on multiple occasions and the food has each time been consistently good. Tom Yum Goong soup is where it should be. Their Green AND Red Curries are excellent. The Pad Thai (trad style with tamarind paste) is very nice and of course it's impossible to screw up coconut rice.
We'll continue to frequent this place. =)"}
{"text":"I haven't been her in awhile. My dining partner and I were in the neighborhood on a Sunday and stopped by for a quick lunch bite. We were greeted and seated by a young man who seemed to do it all: Host, Waiter, Server, Bus Boy, order taker for both in the restaurant and takeout.

The wait time after we sat, then to order, then to deliver our drinks and such was a bit off, but understanding this young man was doing it all. We ordered a Singha Beer and ordered a cup of Tom Ka Gai, Fresh Spring Rolls and the Grilled Beef Salad. When the food arrived it was hot and fresh and tasted delicious. Love this place!

Atmosphere: nice, Service: good, Food: very good"}
{"text":"Came for lunch out of convenience. It was a great find! Inexpensive lunch and tasty Panang Curry Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken. Will come back when in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Always order to-go from here. The servers are always really nice and the food comes out at a good pace. The food is always delicious, and portions are very generous! My absolute favorite dish from here is the pad thai; really good flavor and spice!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I hadn't written a review for Thai House yet, not even their other location in Scottsdale that I frequent just as much. This location is where I go for take-out since it's the closest to my home. I go to the other one to dine-in since it's usually during lunch when I'm working. This location's interior is a lot larger and nicer looking. The food at both are pretty consistent.

The pad thai with chicken and panang curry are my two favorites, I always have a hard time deciding which one I want. I find that the pad thai can be a little hit or miss. Sometimes it's a little on the burnt side or greasy side. The panang seems to always be the same. I also wish that the pad thai came with a wedge of lime. They also have a spicy level scale. I always go for 1 or 2 (not too spicy). The last time I got the pad thai with spicy level 2, it was way too spicy. I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to spiciness but even my boyfriend said it was really hot. You could tell just by looking at it that there were a ton of red flakes. I wish the spiciness level was also a little more consistent because that can make or break the meal.

The best time to go is for lunch because their lunch specials are really great and the portions are huge. It's a little more on the pricey side if you go any other time. However, this is one of the best options around where I live so I've never tried to go anywhere else. Take-out is always really quick. I live about 10 minutes away. I always call in my order right before I leave because by the time I get there it's always there waiting for me."}
{"text":"Decent food, I have never eaten at the restaurant. I live near by so always get it delivered. I give them 5 stars for the delivery service because they are fast on the order, paying over the phone and get it to me within 20 minutes.
The food is good but never constitant but at the same time i've never thought it was bad at all."}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I love Thai House. Delicious food that, once you get seated, comes out hot and quick. The wait can be a little long, so make sure you get there before the lunch rush. I had the yellow curry chicken, and there was plenty of sauce to douse my rice and eat the whole plate. I usually try not to do that, but it was just too good. Don't let the strip mall fool you!! Try Thai House today!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. The writing on the door says they open at 4:30 pm. I got there at 4:25. They saw me but wouldn't let me in. It was 105 degrees outside. 4:30 came and went, door is still locked. At 4:36, they let me in. The lady behind the counter was taking a phone order. After she was through, I said to her \"making me wait outside when it's 5 minutes to opening is not good customer relations.\" SHE ARGUED WITH ME saying twice, \"we open at 4:30.\" I'll never patronize them again."}
{"text":"Got spicy basil chicken & chicken satay it was not good.   We paid and left our meals. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been craving decent Thai food for months ever since the last place we had good Thai was in Texas, (I know, crazy right?) After trying some not so great places I was excited to find high reviews for restaurants around here. Last week we came to Thai House for dinner. I always order the same thing, Panang Chicken Curry. We decided to try the stuffed wontons as an app, and my bf got the spicy chicken dish.

You get 8 wontons for $6, I think that's a little expensive for an app, especially when it's fried wonton wrappers and ground up chicken inside with sweet and sour sauce. But the sweet and sour sauce was delicious so I guess I can't complain too much. 

The Panang, was PERFECT. It was around $9 and the bowl could feed three people at least! Huge servings. Plus another huge bowl of jasmine rice for the table. My bf didn't love his spicy chicken, and ended up eating a good portion of my Panang, obviously he needs to stick with me when it comes to Thai food! I know what's good. The spicy chicken wasn't bad, the veggies were crisp and tasty, but the chicken was a bit rubbery and the sauce wasn't anything special. 

Our drinks were never more than half empty, service was great. The inside of this place isn't huge but we came on a Thursday night and were able to get a great booth as soon as we walked in.

Can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"Green Curry is one of the best I've ever had!  The curry had a great level of sweet and the zucchini was still a little al dente. Delicious!   The pieces of chicken were big and cooked perfectly. I could not recommend more!"}
{"text":"Clean facilities. Friendly staff, good food for a good price. What more can you ask? Only limitations was the lack of their alcohol sales. Otherwise, solid Thai restaurant.
From a level of 1-5, me and the kiddies got 3s and it wasn't spicy at all. Hard to explain but the food here  was a bit sweeter than savory. There is another number scale for those who love the heat. That's a 10-20 scale. Hubs being the hardcore spice fanatic got a 10 out of the 20 for his red curry. The gentleman who was helping us recommended going lower on the scale and adding spice if the heat didn't meet the expectations, which makes sense since once it's too spicy, there's no remedy.

Hubs didn't think 10 was spicy at all so the man brought out the fresh Thai pepper sauce. Wowzah. What a kick. Loved it! A bit too much for me and I used with caution but I can see how people who love spice would love this."}
{"text":"On my quest for great curry I may have found a winner! This place is a little out of my way but I will for sure go back! The curry is rich flavorful thick and delicious. The chicken is not chewy and the vegetables fresh! Very fantastic. The interior is a little dated but the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Love Thai House. They are going to have to get bigger place. Getting very busy. Good people good service, good food."}
{"text":"OH WOW! We just moved over to this side of town,  and was reluctant to try a new thai place,  but this place far exceeds our usual Bangkok 9. There curry pannang with shrimp is without a doubt the best we have ever tasted , we could slurp it and get messy and enjoy every minute. Get the wongtons and dip em in the curry pannang sauce, no regrets there. Timely delivery, moderately priced and online ordering was a breeze! Thank you thai house for an authentic delicious experience!!"}
{"text":"always good and have been there numerous times and had decent service. Sometimes it's a little slow, but worth the wait"}
{"text":"I used to really like this place until our last visit. My hubby and I had lunch here on January 18th, and we had a really awful experience. We ordered our usual, mint chicken and chicken panang curry. The mint chicken was OK(they use ground, chopped chicken for this dish), but after a few bites of the chicken panang curry, we both agreed that the chicken in the panang curry tasted spoiled, and had spit out our food on a napkin. Even the rice was old(it was very dry and yellowish, like it's been in the rice cooker for a few days)! I called the server over and brought the issue to her attention. While she was taking the chicken panang curry away, she asked if we wanted something else. At this point, we're already disgusted and just wanted to leave. I handed the server my credit card to pay and told her, \"We better not be charged for the chicken panang curry.\" Lo and behold, the witch charged me for the disgustingly, spoiled chicken panang curry. I've never in my life done this before, but I didn't sign the credit card receipt nor left a gratuity for the horrendous service and inedible food! I already disputed this charge with my credit card company! NEVER AGAIN!!! BEWARE, EVERYONE!!! This place better be glad that I'm a very busy person, otherwise I would've contacted the Health Department! GROSS!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner for the first time.  Lunches are always solid - dinner however was excellent. Good flavors and nice spice - though not as hot as what we like :)

Good service.  Simple ambiance."}
{"text":"I have been getting take out and home delivery for the last few years from here. The food was always ok. The delivery was pretty good. The last few times we have waited over an hour after the estimated time. The last time we called we sat on hold for an extended period. When we finally got an answer, we were told we could not order. I guess they are doing so well, they don't need the money! Never again will we order from them!"}
{"text":"This is my Thai go to spot. They are super nice, clean, great food and service. My favorite is spicy mint chicken and Penang chicken. My girl loves the spicy eggplant with fried tofu, the steamed is to mushy and doesn't soak the flavor in.  Great portions too...

There is a guy that sings at night on weekends which is kind of funny not terrible just weird match. I wish they would fix their cords on the stage its an eyesore. The rest of the place has nice wood ornamental cabinetry and Thai decor. 

2 thumbs up regular place for us. online ordering works well too and better to use if you want things a special way."}
{"text":"The Thai House is fantastic!  Great food - excellent service and once a month they have a wonderful Asian dance off.  Everything we've tried has been wonderful.  We've been coming here for years."}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai restaurant. Ive been to Pin Koaw and Lotus of Siam and Thai House is still my favorite.   The servers are always very polite and the food is consistently good.  I typically order red curry but venture away from it sometimes and ive never been disappointed.  I always have a really delicious meal here.  I even brought my boyfriend tonight amd he ordered some noodle dish and really liked it."}
{"text":"This is the best thai place in Vegas! This is the only thai place that has the spiciest thai food. Be careful when you order ur number of spicyness. Very friendly staff, karaoke nite i believe on the weekends"}
{"text":"I have been going to this particular Thai restaurant for years. I think they've lowered their spice bar or I've been able to handle more heat because I keep having to up my level each time I order. 

Anyway, whether you like meat or tofu this place is delicious. The spicy garlic shrimp was amazing. My friends cashew lemon was sweet (so realistically not my thing). The tofu is firm which for me is a must. 

Always checking on your table to refill your glass. They did just change their menu though. They went from a wonderfully nice menu that was large and leather-like, to just little lamented menus you would find at a cheap place. Don't let it fool you. It's still good. 

Lastly though, I wish they would change their fish tank. I swear the fish in there are too big for the tank. It makes me sad to look at."}
{"text":"Our favorite cuisine is Thai. The hubs is a chef, so it's safe to say we know good Thai when we have it. 

This is some of the best Thai we've had. The flavours were absolutely spot-on, the perfect balance of acidity and spice. The larb was incredibly good, the glass noodle salad delish, and the pan fried noodles (with tofu) were perfection. 

Wish we lived here, we'd be regulars without a doubt. Don't let the strip-mall ambience throw you, this is definitely a must-go to spot!"}
{"text":"We waited 15 minutes for a table yesterday. It was lunch time and I was craving Thai so we waited......wish we hadn't. 

We started with the fried shrimp appetizer, it wasn't bad just not seasoned at all. I ordered the spicy noodles with chicken and my husband ordered the seafood fried rice. My noodles were a tad bit oily. My husband's dish was okay. So, they give you a mountain of food which we had for leftovers last night. Not sure what they put in the food, but it kept us wide awake all night and had me running to the bathroom first thing in the morning. Needless to say, we will not be back.

I really miss good Thai food."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite Thai restaurant. We would eat here every month for the last several years. But no longer!

VEGETARIANS: Please read this very carefully before you decide to eat here. We have always ordered the curry dish and asked for no fish sauce. They've always said no problem and served us. Tonight we were told by a server that the curry paste is pre-mixed and ALWAYS includes fish sauce!

We are very disturbed by this news and by the fact that we have been lied to for years by this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch had some Spring Rolls and Panang curry both were great. Service was quick and friendly. I would go back."}
{"text":"If I could give them a zero I would. Service and attention to detail was horrible. They sat us down, served us water and forgot about us. As much as I tried to get their attention, they kept on walking by. After 20 minutes I decided to ask my family to get up and kindly leave this place. As we were leaving one employee walked to me and said \"oh...I was about yo go take your order\". I kindly said \"no thank you and walked out. It's unfortunate that they had to see my party leaving to try and take care of our order. A little too late I think. Can't rate the food as we didn't get to try it. This is solely based on customer service."}
{"text":"Good is great but their prices need to one updated online because I was expecting to pay 7.95 for my dish as stated online and walked in and they charged me $11.."}
{"text":"Very good in general, the  portions were abundant, and the food delicious, I highly recommend this restaurant, clean and nice and the price are awesome,"}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice, typical Thai restaurant decor. The food was well priced and in excellent portion. I ordered the curry noodles which tasted really good, except that it was a bit dry and the seasoning didn't seem to have mixed well and it left me with a bad aftertaste, it felt like the dish was over salted but it wasn't. I still enjoyed it despite the fact, I just couldn't finish it. 

My boyfriend ordered the pad won sen and that was also quite tasty. We were told that even at a 0 on the spicy meter, it was still a bit hot, so he ordered his dish at a 2. Even at a 2, the dish was very mild and not spicy at all. 

Our two friends ordered the green curry with tofu and the pad se mao with tofu and they both said their dishes were excellent. 

Overall, the food was excellent, the wait staff were very attentive and came by often to check on us and refill our water. 4 people, 4 dishes and 2 drinks, the tab came out to around $40. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food is always good.
The empolyies are nice and friendly.

ask for the thai hott :D 

the beef is cooked well. 

The rice is sticky just the way it should be."}
{"text":"Ok so found another reason why I need to give them a 4 star...they don't use real Thai chilis! :( ...I'm hoping that it may be because they aren't in season...at least not in Las Vegas???!?!! Idk...it ruins the authentic integrity when you replace those Thai chilis with pepper flakes in my opinion...but don't get me wrong the food is still very very good! :) 

I'll still come back for more why not?! Lol :)"}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunches.  The flavors are there.  I continue to find myself going back to when I'm looking for quick Thai.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the quality of ingredients are not all the best.  It is more like Buffett chicken you would find at an all you can eat joint.  Still tasty just not perfect."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Henderson. My family loves this place. The waitresses know my kids and my kids give them hugs.  Plus they have live music....bonus."}
{"text":"Fast service, huge lunch portion sizes and relatively inexpensive. Definitely worth a shot if you like Thai food."}
{"text":"Thai house has quickly become my favorite Thai place. The flavors in their yellow curry are outstanding. I also appreciate that they will make the papaya salad for me with no fish sauce and no shrimp and it still comes out tasting great. Perfect place for vegan, vegetarian, or normal eater just like most Thai places. 

The rest of my non-vegan family always loved their dishes as well. They are never stingy with the rice and the service has always been good for us."}
{"text":"Thai house is amazing. They have a lunch special for $7 that comes with soup, egg rolls and an entrée. The service is top notch and interior is authentic. If you live in the area stop by"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for dinner with my family.  Walked in to a lively atmosphere with live music.  (A man was singing and playing his guitar and was older, but damn good and singing and playing, he took requests for songs during his breaks).

Service was prompt and friendly.  We ordered a few dishes to share family-style.  Ordered a couple appetizers and 4 different entrees including yellow curry, shrimp with asparagus, spicy bean sprouts, and duck.  

1. Yellow Curry - not the best I've had, but very tasty
2. Shrimp with asparagus - I don't really like asparagus, but my family members enjoyed it
3. Spicy Bean Sprouts - very tasty with just a hint of spicyness, the bean sprouts were cooked but still had a crunch consistency... i was surprised at how much i enjoyed this dish
4. Duck - SALTY! but being that I'm on high-protein diet, I ate it all regardless (I was thirsty for the rest of the night)

All in all, the meal was affordable and the portion sizes are more than adequate.  I honestly would come back for the curry and the atmosphere on a Saturday is one that I recommend experiencing for yourself.  There are other thai restaurants out there but for an area deficient of decent asian restaurants, Thai House is a good option."}
{"text":"So I came here in a rec from everyone, and yes, the food was pretty delicious. What wasn't delicious was the way I was feeling the next day - and most of the week. Yep, good old food poisoning, and this was the likely culprit (only other thing I had eaten to that point was pizza that other colleagues had joined in on). Had egg rolls, green curry with chicken, and a thai tea. 

Sorry, not much more to say than that. Might have been an \"off\" night for 'em, but I was reeling for the rest of my business trip. Yikes."}
{"text":"I'm a huge Thai food fan and my favorite dish is by far the Pad Thai Chicken.  

This place is usually packed for lunch so sometimes we get Take-Out and if it's not packed we'll grab a table.

The lunch portions are awesome and completely fill the plate all the way around.  I'm not sure how they prepare their fried rice, but WOW is it amazing!  I'm tempted to just order a bowl of fried rice every time I go, but the Pad Thai Chicken is SOOO good that I have to settle on that which also comes with a side of fried rice.

I wish there was one closer to my side of town in north Phoenix as the drive out to Scottsdale can be further than I'd like to go at time.

Don't get me wrong, the food is AMAZING!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant is close to where I usually get massages. Several times it's been my after-the-massage, on-the-way-home-so-I-don't-have-to-cook stop. I almost always get the Pad Thai so I can gauge how good a Thai restaurant is first, and this one doesn't disappoint. I always get mine with chicken and shrimp, medium spicy. 

So far I've always gotten it to go; I haven't eaten in yet. The inside is simple but nice, and the service has been quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I will go back  here even though I gave it a 3.  I still recommend this to anyone.

1.  They never asked me the heat level of the curries I ordered. Perhaps because I was with kids, and started with a wonton soup instead of Tom Yam, they assumed I wanted no heat level in the spice.

2.  I had a very hard time to hear the waitress over the loud music. The musician was great, however, I wanted to talk to my guests and it was a bit harder to do with the music.

3.  Ordered Wonton Soup, Rad Na, Red Curry Chicken, Masaman Curry Beef, and this most awesome half chicken fried. Not really a Thai dish, but a delicious fried chicken delicate and flavorful.

4.  They have a lot of Chinese food here in case you have to be careful wifh some of your guest and this is awesome. Some of their chinese dishes are absolutely great. How many places do you know you can get steamed fish?? That is special.

5.  Service overall was nice. I may have had a younger or new waitress, but also a more senior waitress came by during key times and she was very efficient!

I love the decor and the location. Parking is easy and not very busy for a Saturday night.  I am coming back here, because I think I was tired, a bit full from lunch still, and was trying different stuff.  This place seems like it will be a 4-5 the next time I come back.

Check it out and try it, you will be pleased!"}
{"text":"Sooo soothing every time I come here. I love the green curry, Jasmine tea and the tom kah soup was exceptional! I love going Friday nights when there is karaoke and it feels like it's the quintessential Thai house in vegas. This place is a must if you need a break from the strip or just a great place to share plates with family or friends ."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner. There were only 2 servers and a few tables occupied. They had a live singer, who was okay. I ordered vegetable Tom yum soup in a hot pot and it was DELICIOUS! So good and for only $10?! You get like 4 servings! Oh man perfect for the cold night. I also ordered fried banana to go and  I loved it. The service was okay, they seem understaffed, but they are very friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service! They've treated me with open arms! Tofu Yellow Curry and Sweet and Sour Chicken amazingly delicious!  Egg rolls were great also!  Thank you kindly and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in while on vacation in Vegas after we couldn't get into Sushi Mon in same mall area.  It was quite busy with many families that obviously come there often.  Had a wonderful appetizer sampler with incredible sliced bbq pork. Service was very prompt and friendly.  I really enjoyed my Thai style fried rice with chicken, and they happily added lots of basil for me.  I thoroughly enjoyed the solo musician, but my husband didn't care for him.  My husband had the Wor-won-ton soup and did not find it bland at all; in fact he didn't add a ton of soy and chili like he often does.  Over all a very nice dinner."}
{"text":"Our daughter is hardly ever home and since she's home we decided to go to Thai House. We got there early for dinner on a Monday night. Walking in and was greeted right away but the restaurant didn't really standout to me. Fair amount of tables and nice. Nothing special. 

We started out with some Gyoza. It comes with six to an order and a dipping sauce. Tried it and they were ok. Crispy just how I like it but it just seem like it didn't have a lot of taste. Little bland in my opinion.

I ordered the spicy eggplant with pork and medium heat. Really liked it a lot. My meal came with a bowl of rice but had to order an extra bowl to soak up all that sauce. So good. It had nice big portions of eggplant with thinly sliced pork, onions, and peppers. Nice heat. A little too much heat for me but nothing that rice and water didn't help. 

My wife and son ordered the Chow Mein with beef and chicken. They don't like heat at all so they were happy that it wasn't spicy. Didn't really hear a complaint from them and they gobbled their dishes up too. 

My daughter wanted her favorite Drunken Noodles but they call it their Spicy Noodles. So she was happy. She got medium heat too and really loved it. Little too much heat for her too but she was able to finish it. 

To top off our meal we ordered the mango sticky rice. Little different cause the sticky rice and the mango isn't on top of each other but it was just as good. No complaints here. Enjoyed it. Sweet rice with the fresh mango. Each bite was so good. 

So the service was okay. They brought us our drinks right away but we had to keep on asking for refills about three or more times. The server really didn't keep tabs on us to make sure we didn't need anything. 

So I would say that this place has really good food, service is ok. Decent and the atmosphere was ok. Nothing special. If you come here then your coming for the good Thai food and that's all. Just remember it all about the food here. Enjoy"}
{"text":"My family loves coming here because it's close and never really packed if you're comparing it to similar places around the area like Pin Kaow. Me? Not a fan. 

Let me do say that their Thai iced tea size is pretty generous and their Duck Salad is a must try, probably the highlight of my visits. The chicken satay is decent (dry on some days) and their fried rice doesn't taste authentically Thai to me. Every dish is missing that wow factor and even though it wasn't bad, it wasn't memorable at the same time.

The service was friendly. 100%. But never really touched the table enough after that after realizing that our food is taking a long time. Service can be spot on as I'm noticing other tables wondering why no one has approached them either. Service at Thai restaurants are usually pretty genuine but sometimes an extra body on the floor can help with the basic touches it'll take for a customer to come back. Repeatedly."}
{"text":"This place is PACKED right now, and that right there should tell you that the food here is really good to be this packed and busy.

Service is prompt, cut them some slack if they're really busy though, the wait is worth it I PROMISE. tonight I ordered Mixed Veggie soup and let me tell you, it is some damn fresh! You can tell by the color of the veggies and taste that it was just freshly cut and cooked. Broke my scale. I also ordered Orange Chicken. And that is really really good!

My mom ordered an eggplant entree w beef, and she said that was delicious. I can't say for myself bc I'm allergic to eggplant, so I won't be eating it lol.

It may seem pricey, but it really isn't! It's big enough for 2 people! And that's a great deal! 

Thai tea is pretty bomb too(: I most definitely will be coming back (:

Shout out to Hazed (Jhan), he's a fantastic server! (:"}
{"text":"Love this place... Singapore noodles are great and the kids love it!  Papaya salad is good as well."}
{"text":"Had to return something to Best Buy so we decided to grab dinner at the Thai House, this location is off the 101 and Frank Lloyd Wright area. I know they also have a Thai House off the Scottsdale and Shea area.

The restaurant was expanded which is a good thing, more tables! We were seated pretty fast and we knew exactly what we wanted to get. Pad see ew and yellow curry. The pad see ew was spot on, noodles were fresh, the meat was tender. The yellow curry came in a big bowl with fresh white rice, you can easily share this. We left the restaurant with food  we planned on eating for leftovers.

Service was good, could be a little better in the friendly department but that won't stop us from coming back for some good old Thai Food."}
{"text":"Great stuff!      I really love Thai food, and it usually takes me trying 5 or 10 different Thai restaurants around my home before I really find one that does a good job with the intricate flavoring.     So far, Thai House is my pick (though I will continue to try others).

  The one constant problem I have is that the Mussaman Curry is never spicy/'hot' enough for me.    Thai House uses a heat scale of 1 - 10 so the first time I ordered it from them, I asked for #6.    I couldn't really taste any heat at all -- it might as well been level 1 or 2.   Nonetheless, the flavoring was still good.  So the next time I ordered it, I chose level 9.    Again, I could barely notice any spiciness.   So the most recent time, I chose spiciness level 10, which they call \"Are you crazy?\"     It had a couple dried peppers in it & yes, they were certainly spicy when I ate them, but that spiciness wasn't in the rest of the curry.

 I don't know if I have some sort of medical issue which causes me to be impervious to it or what, but it's annoying that I can't eat any Mussaman Curry that causes me to hiccup & sweat.   Again though, this is a problem I have with all the dozens of Thai places I've tried over the past couple years, not just Thai House.

   The 5 times I've been there so far have all been take-out orders, but the dining area looks nice, and it seems like on some nights (Fridays & Saturdays?) they have live music, which could be interesting.

  I pass at least 4 other Thai restaurants tried previously in order to get to Thai House.  For now, it's my go-to place when I am hungry for good Thai food, though I need to keep trying the many other Thai restaurants here in the Henderson & Las Vegas area to find one that can provide a good balance of both heat and other flavoring."}
{"text":"I always said I didn't like curry... but then I ordered the panang chicken to see what these reviews are about! It was delicious. The lunch portion is more than enough. I still have some left for later! 
The orange chicken isn't the best. It isn't crispy."}
{"text":"Got Tom ka gai soup and panang chicken curry spice level 3. Warm but not crazy and enough for 2 to eat and have leftovers. All of it was quite tasty and satisfied the craving. If I come back to North Scottsdale, I would definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"Great Red Curry!! It was so creamy, will definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"This Thai place was a recommendation from my nail artist.  

It is clean and the service was quick and polite. 

Ordered pad Thai - terrible ; very oily, and lack flavor; green curry - very watered down and lacked Thai flavor; and some appetitiAers that were bland. 

If you are hungry only."}
{"text":"I eat Thai food every chance I get. I've been to 5 Star Thai restaurants. I'm talking about the famous kind that celebrities go to and if you didn't book a reservation in advance you're waiting 2 hours. It didn't top this.
I've been to countless little hole in the wall thai restaurants. Self-proclaimed treasures. And everything in between when it comes to Thai food establishments. It didn't top this.
I've spent quite some time in Thailand. Eating panang every day I was there. Nothing topped this.
This place has the BEST panang curry in the world. I know I sound dramatic. But it's true. I was in freaking Thailand eating curry and wishing it was the panang curry I was having here instead. That's crazy. 
Just try it. The food speaks for itself. I've recommended the panang to my family & friends & they have all fallen in love just as I have. 
I don't know if this is a good or bad thing. Nothing will ever beat it. I've been spoiled by Thai House. So creamy. So perfect. Never disappointing.
I LOVE YOU THAI HOUSE CURRY!!!!! NEVER CHANGE!"}
{"text":"This is the only Thai place in the area (that I know of) and it's not bad so I come a few times a month. I love their noodles. I've had their Pad Thai and Spicy Noodle dishes, as well as the green and red curry (I prefer the red). I ate here tonight so it reminded me to leave a review. I came with my mom and brother and we all enjoyed the food. We all got one entree that each were \"served with rice,\" however they brought a big bowl of rice that was not sufficient for all 3 of us so we asked for more (that was a $1.50 charge). My brother and I also both ordered 5 on their spicy scale (they do 0-5) and neither my brother nor I found it spicy at all. Food is good, portions are good, and prices are good too. Definitely worth checking out, but if you like spicy, you'll need to be adding chili paste on top of the \"level 5 spice.\""}
{"text":"Hard to find a decent Thai restaurant in the PHX area. This place does not disappoint. Always has a crowd, but the restaurant is able to turn tables. My favorite dish is the Mussamun curry. Just the right spices and heat."}
{"text":"Thai House is a good go-to for a cheap, substantial lunch. I tried their panang curry with a side of fried rice, and while it wasn't incredible, it tasted decent and came with sizable portions. I would say Thai House is a good place to grab a bit and take home some leftovers."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely delicious! My girlfriend and I both enjoyed our meals very much. I had the Panang curry and she had the pineapple rice. As per our custom, we sampled eachother's foods and couldn't decide which one we liked better. I also enjoyed a (reasonably priced) Thai tea with my meal. If you're in the Scottsdale area and have a hankering for some Thai food, this is definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"I'm OBSESSED with their Panang chicken!!!  I could literally drink that luscious red curry/coconut milk gravy by itself.  Their lunch specials are a great value, featuring soup or salad with your entree of choice plus rice of choice for around $8.00.  I have to have my Panang fix weekly.  The only other dish I've tried was the pepper garlic chicken, and it too was delicious.  Service is fast, which is another reason why this place is a great call for lunch."}
{"text":"Ate here with a friend on a weekend in June 2012.  Food was ok, we were pretty happy with the service and the restaurant decor nice.  The waitress uniforms (traditional Thai dresses?) were a nice touch.

Just like every(?) Vegas Thai restaurant I've been to so far, they have a great deal on weekday lunch specials.  Had I been there for that I probably would have given them 4-stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner as this place was convenient location in Scottsdale.   Reasonably priced, as is most Thai food, but found the food just average.   Good size portions but nothing to 'write home about'.    Think I'll try someplace else next time."}
{"text":"BEST THAI I've had in a while! Bold delicious flavors. First ordered a huge Thai iced tea. We tried the fresh spring rolls they were cold crisp and flavorful. Then had a cup of veggie soup. This soup was so good and the veggies were aldente not mushy. Then came the Penang curry. Tried it with chicken, very good, nice peanut flavor but not too sweet. I ordered a level 3 spicy on the 0-5 scale and will likely go up to 4 on my next visit. This is a great little find."}
{"text":"Just received our delivery order. Ordered one sweet and sour chicken (Thai style) and two things of pad thai. The sweet and sour chicken I ordered I expected to be breaded and it wasn't. It was also very dry. Didn't even eat it (waste of $10.95). The orders of pad thai were noted to be bland in flavor and also have dry chicken. Very displeased and not worth the $40 we paid!"}
{"text":"The only thing you can say critically about the Thai House is the location isn't a home run.  But get past that, and get inside because the food is top shelf and the recepies are authentic making this a fave five spot for my family.  Start with a Thai Iced Tea, try a spicy soup, and don't miss the curry - but beware of the heat index and order according to your ability to enjoy flame in your flavor!  My personal favorite is tradtional Pad Thai - the perfect balance of peanut and chili spice with sticky noodles & chicken..."}
{"text":"The sign and website says it is open until 3. We arrived at 10 before 3, and they would not serve us. We drove quite a way to get there in reliance in their posted close time. I told them that and they do not care. We won't be back."}
{"text":"YUM. My significant other and I usually get our Thai staples of yellow curry and pad see ew whenever we visit a new to us Thai joint. We got the yellow curry with tofu - sand onions and sub broccoli. My s.o. says that she could eat the yellow curry every day for the rest of her life. I am with her in it being a 5/5 dish. Plus, the base does not have fish sauce so that's a vegetarian win! The pad see ew was just right and I was very satisfied. No baby corns that I could add on, but that's minor. Large portions and attentive, friendly service.

Then space itself was large and spacious. We visited on a Friday night and it was moderately busy. We barely had a wait for our food to come out...I would estimate 10-15 minutes. I also got the Thai iced tea for $2. It was very sweet...but that's the nature of the drink I suppose. Dinner for two was $25, I would say that's a pretty good deal!

My belly is full and happy. We'll be back here soon!"}
{"text":"I'm always one to give chances at redemption. I figured it's been close to 3 years so it can't be worse. I ordered pad woon sen and got pretty much a box of mushy tomatoes, baby corn and some peas! There were about 5 small shrimp and a small serving spoon of noodles. When I brought it to their attention,  the attitude was horrible! You all just charged us $14.02 for what your menu said would contain JUMBO SHRIMPS! That's false advertising.  But to act like we were wrong,  is too much. Our money is green and we won't spend another dime of it here! Thanks, but no thanks!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed everything about this place. 
The quick service (though incredibly busy at lunch, we got in just before the line started)
The the tasty food and great spice 

We had Thai fried rice, pineapple fried rice and pad woon sen. 

Some of the best pws I've had in recent months."}
{"text":"Don't let the look of this place fool you. 

There are a few locations around the valley and they are all equally amazing.  Everything I have tried here completely knocks my socks off.  A few of my favorites include... The Red Curry, The Pan Fried Noodles (Gai Kua), and The Satay. 

Dining in our taking out, they have some great lunch specials, and if you're in a hurry call ahead and pick up.  They always amaze me with how fast they can prepare the food!  The portions are large so left overs are pretty much a guarantee. 

If you happen upon this place give it a chance, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Good solid Thai food! Exactly what you'd expect - great curries, low prices. If you're looking for consistency, this is your place. Hard to communicate with staff, but the food is great."}
{"text":"Best Thai food around. I used to work close by and would be a frequent customer. Pad Thai is amazing and everything else is great too!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food and I was really excited to try this place, and it was OK. The portions were nice and big we had the Tom Ka Gai (coconut milk Soup), Chicken Sate, Masumum Curry, and Gangari Curry. The soup was good, the Sate was also good. The curries were very watered down The Masumum even though it was watered down it was still good but the Gangari because of being watered down was lacking flavor. The server was very nice, and helpful. This place is ok for fast Thai food when you are am craving Thai and you just can't drive to the West side of town then this place is good enough to kill the craving. But unfortunately it is definitely not anywhere near the best Thai food in the Valley. But it was nice and I would return but unfortunately this one could not score any higher than a 3 for me. So I guess when I want the best Thai in the valley I still have to truck it to the west side. Oh well."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in town! Big portions, good prices. My favorites are green curry chicken, Tom Ka soup, and the spring rolls."}
{"text":"I stopped by here recently and was hooked! I've only tried their Yellow Curry, but it's SO good! The portion is also very generous! I put it on Quinoa instead of rice and can get at least 4 meals out of it. Perfect homey feeling comfort food. YUM!

Definitely looks like a hole-in-the-wall kind of place as it's lacking in personal touch, but don't judge a book by its cover ;)"}
{"text":"I went in here today for lunch with a girlfriend and ordered to go. I'm giving it only 3 stars because of the customer service being so poor. The gentlemen that took our order was incredibly rude to us throughout taking our order. The lunch special was $6.95, which is a great price! And the food was good and there was plenty of it! The Panang curry was good, nothing to write home about, but fine. I wouldn't go back here unless I was in the area... I love Thai food, but this isn't as good as other places I have tried in the valley."}
{"text":"Thai house is my favorite Thai place! They are always fast and friendly. The food is consistently delicious. 

Some of my favorite dishes include pad see ew with beef and panang with beef. They're also good with chicken, but the beef is tender and a bit tastier. 

We tried the gyoza the last visit and the crispy outside definitely added to it! 

The mango sticky rice is a nice treat when you're not too full already."}
{"text":"One of great Thai restaurants I have been. I ordered pad thai chicken, pan fried noodles and spicy basil tofu. The spice was great 3/5 seems to be spicy for me though but the food was tastyz. Ambience is great with good service and quick servings. Thai iced tea is a must!"}
{"text":"I discovered this restaurant recently when my mom was visiting and I can't get enough of it! I'm addicted to the pineapple red curry, but I get it with chicken instead of shrimp. It's absolutely delicious! Also, their spring rolls are very good and what is a Thai meal without a yummy Thai tea?! Im glad that this location is right down the street from my condo. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I like this place.  We eat here maybe once every 2 months.  I'd prefer to eat here more often but my wife isn't a big fan of Thai food.  I always get the mussaman curry and like it a lot.  Prices are fair."}
{"text":"we have lived in Las Vegas for over a 14 years now and not only do we enjoy dining in the delightful atmosphere, we also order delivery and it never fails to be speedy, steaming hot, and full of deliciousness. We never order out from anyplace else, lol, so you can figure if we eat Thai  every couple weeks for all that time, its got to be good. I cant imagine wtf is up with these other folks that think theyre rude or something, we've never had any such issue. Some of the servers have not so great English, but they are perfectly gracious and polite to us every time. I CAUTION everyone, theyre not joking about the spicy and if you cant handle hot, even the #1 level of heat is going to be too much for you, do yourself a favor and order something that isnt spicy. I used to eat hot New Mexico green chile on tortillas, so when I tell ya I can barely eat the curry at level 1, take my word for it. (yes, I eat it anyway, its that good)"}
{"text":"Excellent bang for your buck.

I have been going here for years and have had many of their lunch specials and red/panang curries.  All of them taste great, well portioned and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Only been once so far. Had wonton soup -best I've ever had. My friend & I both ordered curries (different ones) & both were excellent. Enjoyed so much, ordered identical items for take out for my wife & for his daughter and both also thought food was great. Only complaint was noise - loud water feature + music + talking + a whiney toddler nearby. They need to get rid of music or water feature or invest in acoustic tiles. Service was friendly & quick."}
{"text":"Best Thai around! Had a wonderful meal and their staff is so nice. Great food and service. The mango sticky rice is to die for."}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food, and very entertaining live music  will definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"We picked up dinner from Thai House because of its high rating reviews and its proximity from our hotel.

Chicken and shrimp pad see ew ($9.95) $1 extra for chicken $2 extra for shrimps: semi bland dish. 

Beef panang ($10.95) with $1 extra for beef: not the best quality of beef, but the curry flavor was very good. They didn't skimp on the coconut milk, the beef and the seasonings. Too bad the beef was not evenly cut and not sliced all the way. We didn't finish the curry and ate the leftover the next night. The flavor was even better the second time around. 

The worker was not friendly at all.  
 
3 stars!!

Thai House is almost yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food for your dollar in the entire valley. I'm no Thai expert, but I have been to at least a dozen here in the valley. Keep in mind - this is NOT a fancy place - just a simple, inexpensive, casual dining experience. WOW!"}
{"text":"Tried this as a new dinner place while in Vegas and it was very good.  Tom Kha soup was delicious and crab rangoon appetizer was perfectly-fried but not greasy."}
{"text":"I love it here! I have tried their pad thai, pad kee Mao, Tom yum, beef with broccoli , catfish- superb! red curry and parang curry is the best!!! The servers and the counter people are so respectful and very helpful. This is the best thai place in scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for years. The staff is always great to me and the food never disappoints. I've usually got enough left over to make a few more meals out of it. :) highly recommend."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I love coming here for lunch! It's been really hard to dine-in any time we've come by, so we end up ordering to-go or giving up ahead of time and calling ahead to order carry out. Normally by the time we order ahead and drive over all of our orders are ready. Unfortunately if you have to wait for to-go or a table there is not much space to do so, especially during peak dining times.

Their lunch specials are fairly amazing! So much food for about $8- we're always needing an afternoon nap soon after lunching here. I can't say I'm in love with the daily soup (seems to always be not-my-fave egg drop) or the salad as part of the lunch special, and the fact they give so much rice! Their spicy level is really good, it's not terribly hot or not for my comfort level."}
{"text":"Our first time. We will have many more visits I think.

Not a large place so we were happy we arrived early for dinner on Friday. Plenty of parking. Not a noisy environment.

I had salmon Penang, Mrs. the special Duck curry.

Large portions, fresh rice, very friendly service. Alcohol is not sold there, I didn't ask if BYO is possible.

We loved the food and place."}
{"text":"I really like the lunch specials at Thai House. The Panang Curry Chicken (spice level 4) is always my go to. It's so delicious over white rice! Enjoy... ****4 Stars."}
{"text":"Cannot say enough about this place!! It's our local joint and no other thai compares. Love the pad thai and Tom yum."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed lunch here many times, and yesterday was exceptional.  I really enjoyed the red curry, and the heat was exactly medium.  Dining companion had the beef and broccoli, and the portion was enormous!  They still offer a $7 lunch with soup or salad, but go early because they get super crowded by 1130! 

Last time, I ordered the Thai basil chicken. Again, very large portion? but this dish is prepared with very few vegetables, unlike many other Thai restaurants.  Not my favorite style but still tasty and plentiful."}
{"text":"this place is right around the corner from my house and I gave it extra points for it...but after going to Chuchote Thai Bistro & Desserts and Weera Thai on Sahara many times I realize this place is Thai food from 1972...the restaurant itself is dark and dank...its average at best..."}
{"text":"My all time favorite Thai restaurant! I can never find a place that can beat their Chicken Larb or Curry or Pad Thai!!  Also, their Thai Tea is amazing, but I'd suggest getting it TOGO because it's bigger but for the same price! Oh speaking of price, they're fair price for allot of food. They servers are super friendly. I definitely come here at least once every two weeks!"}
{"text":"We came on a Friday evening and ordered 
1. Pad thai beef, 10.95
2. Spicy eggplant mint with fried tofu, 10.95
3. Yellow Curry, 10.95
for $40

- We came in a little before 9. Seated right away. Ordered food within 5 min. 
- Excellent service. Upbeat. Smiley. Didn't have to ask for water refills, to-go boxes, or a check. 
- Boring menu. Aren't these To-Go?
- Nice presentation of foods. Fancy utensils, napkins, place mat, and plating. 
- Food came fresh all at the same time.
- Food came with steamed rice. Came in a decorative bowl. I've been been many Asian restaurants, and not many Thai restaurants in Vegas put their rice in this kind of bowl. It's usually in a tiny rice bowl. 
-  Spice rack looked nice. 
- Yellow curry: Chicken was a bit hard. Potatoes and carrots cut nicely. Thick and well-flavored curry. 
- Pad Thai: Good. Not too sweet. 
- Spicy eggplant: Inconsistently cut eggplant. Some were raw others were well done. A little disappointing. 
 - No karaoke on a Friday night? haha. 
- Definitely would want to try their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"If losing weight is what you're after, come here. My friend and I were craving Thai food and the closest place to his house was this. Wrong place, wrong time to want delicious Thai treats.

The place had lots of empty tables at dinner time. We placed a to-go order and waited a few minutes. We got fried tofu, beef Thai spicy salad, sweet and sour chicken and Thai iced tea.

Fried Tofu:
Average and nothing special which is a shame because I love tofu. The peanut sauce was bland and super runny. 1/5

Beef Thai Spicy Salad:
Thin slices of beef on a bed of unchopped/ unshredded lettuce, carrots, cucumbers, and I asked for no onions. It was as if it was too damn tideous to chop lettuce! The dressing was pretty good - a little sweet and spicy and you can choose on the spicy level from 1-10. 3/5

Sweet and Sour Chicken:
The worst thing to order but this is what my friend wanted. He ate a few pieces until he noticed a very bloody piece of chicken. Seriously, that is plain gross. Salmonella!!! Which reminds me, I should probably check if my friend has puked his brains out. 1/5...make that -5/5

Why even bother running a restaurant if you can't even do the basics? Chopping lettuce and you know, cooking chicken. Salmonella: lose 9lbs in 3 days or your money back! Pad See EEEEEWWWW!!!"}
{"text":"YUM. Note that. Capital Y-U-M. I've had this place written down on a note for ages after searching for a decent Thai place nearby ages ago. I FINALLY got around to going last week and I cannot WAIT to go back.

Service was AMAZING and incredibly friendly. It was one of those experiences where you felt very welcome and completely at ease. The food was flavorful, hot and wonderfully perfect in terms of spice. I ordered the Masuman Curry w/ tofu (a staple of mine) and my boyfriend ordered the Green Curry w/ tofu. Both were terrific, good portions (enough for a full lunch the next day) and came with an abundance of rice. Maybe I've just become so used to rice costing extra and coming in a tiny little bowl, but this was a welcome change. Again... more for leftovers!

Seriously... this place has won a place in my heart and I can't wait to go back and try more off the menu."}
{"text":"First time @ Thai House, my man picked it for his birthday dinner. It was empty inside, no guests. We ordered the same dish, he had the red curry with fried tofu spicy level 4 and I had the red curry with steamed tofu spicy level 10. They swapped our tofu in the spicy levels when the food came out. We figured it out after a few bites... my boyfriend was sweating bullets with his fried tofu and I thought my level 10 was really weak. We then took the tofu out of each of our dishes and swapped our curries.... by the time we did so and attempted to fix it, our dishes were cold and he could still taste the spicy level 10 on his tofu so it didn't help much. We then told our server and we could tell she was confused because to her the dishes looked right (because we swapped them) but my boyfriend insisted that she take them back to remake.... because they did not come out right, they were cold at that point, and he still couldn't eat it because of the spice on his tofu. She kind fought us on it until he was very firm on this request and she realized he wasn't going to take no for an answer. This is very unlike him, he'd never do this but he was furious at her reaction and how unwilling she was to apologize and gladly remake our dishes the correct way. I was shocked at how persistent he was! She grunted when she grabbed the dishes off our table and went to the back. I was worried they'd spit in our meals :(
Our dishes came back out, the right way... thank goodness. We ate, they were delicious! But she just hated us after that. No attentiveness, bad service as you can imagine, she was eating with her coworkers in the corner. We packed the rest of our meals to go and she just brought our check, didn't even offer dessert or anything. We wouldn't have gotten any because we were so full.... but it was his birthday!!!! What if he did want dessert?!! What if we brought friends and family here and wanted to sing and celebrate?! Because they messed up our meals, she's mad at us?!!!!??! It was a salty end to his day and it made me upset that she never tried to turn it around. Shame, because the food was good! Guess we'll stick with Pin Kaow or Lucky Thai."}
{"text":"This place is a little hole-in-the-wall!  My sister and brother-in-law took us to this restaurant while we were visiting over Thanksgiving.  I ordered the Masaman Curry and it was HEAVENLY!  It was perfect and creamy and the potatoes were cooked to perfection.  I also got the Thai iced tea, also yummy and creamy."}
{"text":"While on a business trip in Scottsdale, my co worker and I were craving some Thai food! Since my fiancé doesn't typically like this kind of cuisine I figured I would love it up while on this trip. 

Our shuttle driver told us this was definitely the place to go! Our appetizers (chicken gyoza and chicken wonton soup) were both the BEST apps I have ever had. I was somewhat disappointed with the flavor of my pad Thai... it's just not what I was expecting. Maybe I'm just super used to the pad Thai I normally order at home. 

I enjoyed our quick service and they had a great menu. You get a ton of food for the price! We met some very nice locals that suggested more stops while we are on our trip.

I would like to come back and sample several more appetizers!"}
{"text":"I was craving Thai food and was in the neighborhood; though it was almost closing time, I got takeout, and it was ready in almost no time at all.  To be honest, I've had tofu Pad Thai at many different restaurants, and the way they make it here doesn't have the most flavor; I say that as a compliment, however, because it tastes like it could be made at home with regular ingredients - not tons of MSG like I think a lot of Thai/Asian food places use to give people that \"flavor\" they just can't get at home.  Sometimes, it's nice to go and get the flavor of a home-cooked Thai meal without having to make it yourself.

I was also amused by the Asian couple doing karaoke while I was there; they were very cute!  Next time I want Thai food close to home, I'll be returning here - perhaps next time to dine in, so I can relax and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery of crab rangoon, green curry with pork, satay chicken, some fresh rolls and egg rolls. They said it would take an hour, we're about six miles from the restaurant. They arrived in thirty minutes. And the food disappeared in about ten minutes. It was so good. I asked for a spicy level of 8 on the curry, and it was there. I'd never had anything from this place before. But I will order from here again."}
{"text":"LOOOOOOVE this place!!!! Get the number 42, it's the spicy noodles with basil, bell pepper, your choice of meat and you can get it as spicy as you want it!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the yellow curry.  Have eaten this dish many times at many places and is was very tasty.  Ordered a 4 out of 5 on the spice meter...could have gone with a 5."}
{"text":"My son (he's 9) has been begging for me to go - its his favorite restaurant right now. Food was delicious and portions large (I got two more meals out of my leftovers). Also they were very familiar with their ingredients which helps since I have food allergies"}
{"text":"I use to love this place then I went to Weeria Thai on the other side of town and my standards have changed!  Ordered out last night from Thai House.  Tom Kha Gai soup was good, Pad Thai was missing somthing like peanut sauce, Cashew Chicken veggies were great, chicken bland and a few cashews, Pad See Ew was good but beef a little grisly.  Makes me sad as they are just around the corner from me."}
{"text":"I enjoy being accompanied by knowledgeable customers during my first time experiences at new restaurants, so I was quite pleased when Yuko suggested Thai House after our late afternoon hike at Camelback.

I had read her review the day prior to coming, so I recall her photo of what appeared to be a peanut curry.  It's a name I am not familiar with: Mus-sa-mum... but its a taste I will crave until my descent into frontal lobe dementia is but a forgotten memory.  It was a delicious peanut curry sauce, with strips of beef and chunks of white potato.  Some sauteed button mushrooms would have been divine, but I'll keep that recipe in my pocket for now.  I think I'll call my version: Mush-sa-rum.

I already have a twinsie, so I opted for their green curry over an \"I'll take that as well\".  It was every bit as delicious as my first green curry, so dont worry, Murray.  All arrived at the table with a large bowl of sticky rice.  After spooning both curries over my starch, my chop stick skills impressed my hiking partner so much, that she commented \"Why dont you just use a fork\"

I would love to come back and try a noodle dish, or a Tom Kha, or some egg rolls.  The food was wonderful, portion sized generous, and the kids working didnt hassle us for hanging around and carrying on for an hour or so"}
{"text":"You know what I look for in a Thai Restaurant?  Awkward social interactions.

Don't get me wrong, Thai House rocks!  From their musamum curry to their pad thai, they know their way around a wok, or whatever racially charged cooking implement they got going on back there.

I have great memories of TH, especially since this is where part of my GD interview occurred.  This review, however, ignores all former bliss, and attempts to regale the reader with details from one visit in particular.

2016.  That was my first year on the job.  Bad year for phishers, bad year for David Bowie, bad year for comb-overs... we had the US Govt telling Apple to provide a back door into their phones.

Listen, I don't judge a man by the length of his hair or the kind of music he listens to. Gregorian Chant was never my bag.  But you put on a pair of shoes when you walk into Thai House, fella.

As I sat and awaited the arrival of my curry dish, I grew bored of my phone.  I looked around to notice the other customers in the dining room, and quickly grew bored of them.  To  my right, a younger couple on a date, to my left, a Vato sitting alone with his noodle dish.

Shifting my focus now to Instagram, I didn't look up when I heard the bells on the door rattle, or when a shadow passed before me.  I didn't even budge when I heard conversation ensue at the table to my left.

But once I heard the familiar words \"and I went an had an abortion because its what you wanted me to do, and now you're treating me like this?!?!\", my ears perked up.  IG became hum drum in this new drama that was playing out on my southpaw, which grew more intense with each syllable.

Great lines ensued from the shadowy woman, such as:
* Why are you treating me like this?  I'm saying I love you!
* I asked you before I moved out here if you wanted to be with me!
* You don't want me around?  But I want to live with my husband!
* Stop disrespecting me!  Put your phone down when I'm talking to you!
* I wasn't looking at my phone, I was just checking it!  Stop disrespecting me!
* Are you saying you don't love me anymore?

I'm not poking fun at this late 20's couple, who clearly, could both stand for some marriage counseling... but choosing a quiet restaurant to host a relationship meltdown was a poor choice... as we all were drafted to become awkward audience members in a Springer'esque soap opera... except no one was chanting \"Jerrrry Jerrrry\""}
{"text":"I don't know what this place looks like since my girlfriend picked up the food both times I've had it... but I can tell you that the Pad Sew Eu, Pad Thai, Pad Won Ton Soup, Spring Rolls, and Spicy Eggplant dishes were just what the doctor (or Gabi in my case) ordered. Thai is usually not my first choice of food when we're figuring out what's for dinner, but this place does not disappoint.  I'm sure my arm will be twisted into taking out (or maybe even eating in) Thai House again soon."}
{"text":"For someone who claims to not like many kinds of food, I find that I end up eating it anyways. Thai could be categorized into that. It isn't like Vegas has any shortage of Thai restaurants, but the good ones are not as bountiful.

My issue with Thai tends to be that it is too rich, too sweet, and just overwhelming. Great Thai does not have to be this way.

Thai House is good. I just felt bogged down afterwards. All of the appetizers are fried. I knew I would get nowhere trying to order papaya salad with my friends so I just let them order. The wings and the sampler plate was at least not sitting in a pool of oil. The duck curry was short on the meat and was overpowered by the coconut. The pad see ew was the dish I liked the most. Their house fried rice is interesting, too. The pineapple, raisins and nuts made me think of biryani. I love biryani and it was different than anything other Thai place. For its close proximity, I would go back again for the last two dishes."}
{"text":"I think this place is great, I ate here 2 times last week (4 times if you count my left overs).  The staff is always friendly and the food is fantastic.  The crab rangoon are so good, get them you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible service.. Instead, go to La's Thai cuisine! Their restaurant has a way better ambiance and the staff is very friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Ever have one of those days where you're feeling too lazy to cook and don't feel like going out to a restaurant?   Yeah sure, we all do right?  How about the days where you feel too lazy to even shower and can't bear to pick up the phone to call in a take out order?   Just me?   Anyway, I have these days.  I call them Sundays.

Sundays are often days where I need to just be able to jump on my laptop, fill out what I want to eat on the computer during a Mad Men commercial break, and have it appear at my door as if by magic (Gasoline, how does it work?)

To be brutally honest though, this is the only reason I ever eat Thai House.  The food is always decent, but rarely spectacular.  My favorite dishes so far have been the curries, namely Panang with Pork (the Red and Green were also good).  I've been unimpressed with most of the noodle dishes thus far (Pad See Ew in particular), and the Tom Yum soup was lacking when I've had it a few times.  

So stick with the Curries and order in between your episodes of Game of Thrones and the Killing and let Thai House handle the rest.   But put some pants on before you answer the door for heaven's sake."}
{"text":"Love this Filipino run Thai restaurant.

We were with our dad who can't handle spicy food.  They were very accommodating and made sure our meal was enjoyed by everyone.

Pad Woon Sen - this was on the special board and I am always happy to see it.  This was filled with vegetables, chicken, and beef.  Perfectly cooked!

Pad See Ew - the wide noodles were well cooked with just enough sauce.  The beef was a perfect addition.

Spicy Eggplant - They made it not spicy and it was in a light black bean sauce with tons of vegetables (mainly peppers and onions).  We picked it with chicken that was just slightly dry.  I should have gone with pork or tofu.

Spicy Salmon - This was another special.  Deep fried salmon (no batter) that is quickly stir fried with vegetables in a sweet sauce (probably would have been perfect with some heat but we asked for 0 spicy)

Mango with sticky rice - perfect portion, wonderfully ripe mango and not too sweet rice.

Prices were VERY reasonable.  Our entire bill was less than $50.  Servers were attentive.  Food was tasty.  Portions were huge.  Definitely deserves repeat business!"}
{"text":"Love this place- eat here almost once a week. The best part is online ordering, they remember what you order, store your payment option and deliver to the min of when they say. Love it!

We love the currys, spicy fried rice, spicy chili mint, and all the noodle dishes."}
{"text":"Went in again...dine in this time, to try some new dishes. Not as impressed this time around? Ordered the pad thai with beef and it was just ok. The flavor was off, and too sweet in a sick way. We barely touched it. We ordered a chicken and vegetable dish too, and it was just kind of gross. I guess we need to just stick with the curry? :("}
{"text":"Got the lunch chicken pad Thai today. For $7.50 was alot of food. Came with choice of rice also which I thought was odd for a noodle dish. Would of rather had a spring roll or something. Also came with a little salad with minimal dressing if any, left that to the side!  The taste was ok, was it bad? No. Would I crave it again? Not necessarily... The heat factor was intense, I love spicy food and I got the 3 out of a 5 scale and I was kind of happy I had the rice after the fact to soak up some of the heat! Tasted fresh but was a bit lacking flavor for me, won't be in a rush to return."}
{"text":"Okay, let me start off with saying that I've eaten a lot of Thai food around the valley and this place by far is the best I've ever had! When my wife and I go we try and order something different every time to mix things up. I have to say that every dish we've ordered has been nothing short of stellar. I cannot stop talking about it, it's so good. I even order Togo so I can eat for a couple days out 

Please go and try this wonderful place and you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I love this place I order delivery from here maybe everyday to every other day I love the yellow shrimp curry and the ap. Butterfly shrimp as well as the Thai tea which is my favorite always comes huge to have more to or more than one person. I also love the shrimp and broccoli with garlic and shrimp fried rice all very delicious as well as the delivery is quick never have waited one time to long. Great service yum yum"}
{"text":"Always always always good.....good prices and large portions!!!! I usually have it delivered but the few times I have been in to the restaurant it is clean and the staff is friendly. As a matter of fact I am ordering my regular right now......mmmmmm!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Pad see ew is terrific! I've also had the spicy noodles, pad thai, thai fried rice, pineapple fried rice. Haven't had anything I didn't like from here. Take out is also fast and easy and has become pretty much a weekly occurrence. The staff is nice and the restaurant is clean. Definitely one of the best thai restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food.  We had green curry and pad thai.  I've never had green curry before and really enjoyed it.  Happy to have leftovers.  The downfall?  No alcohol.  Not even beer.  I'm not sure if you can bring any in."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but lately the spicy level is off. I order green curry spicy level 1 for delivery. It was so hot I couldn't eat it. I'd say it was spicy level 9. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was good- pad Thai w Tofu which is my go to Thai dish

Beware Their website was misleading w the prices. They need to update their prices on the website. When I objected. The cashier just smiled and shrugged.  Beware

3 stars because I felt duped on the price. Call me a stickler but I like to be prepared and obviously disappointment doesn't suit me well. I could have used the extra dollars for a drink. Boo."}
{"text":"Wow this place was jam packed upon our arrival. Luckily, we did not have to wait very long for a table. The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge. The quality of the food is superb but the service may be a little spotty due to the restaurant being super busy when we were there. The food came out in no time at all . We ordered a chicken satay appetizer and chicken  panang curry and it was absolutely out of this world. The curry was velvety and smooth with the perfect amount of spice. Not that its a big deal but the dining room itself is fairly bland with not much decoration. The staff was very hurried trying to please everyone....

I sat down waiting for a friend, and no one came to the table to offer whether I would like a drink or to order until the rest of my party arrived.

The dinner entree was huge and plenty for two people to share with enough to take home.
Our bill was $ 20.00 and some change and well worth it. Another great discovery and regret not having tried Thai House sooner."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Thai restaurants in northeast Ohio.  As a vegetarian I usually get either the Pad Thai, Penang curry, red curry, or green curry with vegetables.
I usually get carryout unless I am with my coworkers for lunch.  The atmosphere is not great, but the service is friendly the place is clean.
I like asking for my food spicy, but I am sure the must be laughing when I leave as it is VERY SPICY sometimes!  I love it."}
{"text":"I've been to multiple Thai places. I don't think I like any spicy basil besides what this place makes! Their egg drop soup is really good with a kick of the hot chili sauce! There is only one female server here that is so friendly, always welcoming & she is always there. Everyone else looks tired here all the time. They don't even smile at all."}
{"text":"Yummy for the tummy! Always when I come here I take out food. I come during lunch and they are always busy, but still get your food fast. Fresh and delicious, always crave for more. My favorite is #55 on the menu with shrimp I add some spice and always have a lot of food left because the size they serve is huge. Wish I could have more space in my belly to eat it all. They also have the best Thai tea in town. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious. 

New in town and I had NO idea where to go to eat. 

After reading the reviews I was confident the meal should be decent but it exceeded my expectations. 

I had the panang. Mom enjoyed a coconut milk and potato dish and my step father had something with flat noodles, beef and broccoli. I am pretty sure they brought out the wrong dish for him but he enjoyed it regardless(too lazy to check the menu and confirm the entree selections). You can get your meal prepared at 5 levels of spice. i went with spice level 3 which was spicy enough but not enough to make you down a jug of water. 

Though seemingly understaffed they served us promptly. 

The Thai Iced tea was DELICIOUS and according to Mom and LLG the mango and sweet sticky rice were wonderful. Other patrons who saw the dessert also remarked about getting it to cap off their meal.

Its BYOB which is awesome and they have  sister restaurant that is advertised just in case you don't want to wait for your meal. 

I will return to try some other menu items as well as see how spicy level 5 REALLY is."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! So we were having thai withdrawal because Flagstaff restaurants have been out of their ingredients. Anyway, this was a breath of fresh air.  highly enjoyed the green curry!!!  So good. Their noodles weren't bad either. They have the actual thai noodles that Flag doesn't.... I hope we go back before leaving."}
{"text":"Great food, super portions very fresh and good prices!  Thai House is quickly becoming my favorite. 
*Noodles Ranch in S. Scottsdale is one of my favorites when I'm out there."}
{"text":"Typical Thai menu and dining room setup. Food is good to great. We're fans of the spicy basil and chicken while my son loves the orange chicken. 

They're efficient and have always been friendly. Dining room is relatively small and it can get crowded during rushes.

I've been to both locations and prefer the one on Shea for a more intimate feel."}
{"text":"We have been on a never ending search for great Thai food in Vegas for awhile now. Well, we finally found it here. The food is excellent and the service is too. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I've been on a variety of occasions, both with friends and family, and I highly recommend it. I have never been disappointed in the food; from the curry to the pad thai, it's all excellent. The prices are fair, especially if you go for lunch on weekdays (Less than $10 and you get an entree, soup, and your choice of a chicken wing or wantons!) On top of all of that the staff couldn't be nicer! Efficient and friendly, they keep me coming back to try more tasty Thai dishes."}
{"text":"Good food! The place is very clean & service is fast.  It's was crowded during dinner time. But we were seated right away. The tables are just too close to each other. Otherwise, it's a five star."}
{"text":"Food 5++++ stars
Service 1 star
Atmosphere 2.5 stars
Value 5 stars
Lack of Beer/Wine 1 star

I found Thai House and ate it for lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day.  If I need to tell you anything about the food after that, maybe you should go back and read the first sentence again.

The food ain't the problem.  In fact, I really wish this place was located closer to either my house or my office.  I would spend a whole lot of time here.  

Thai House is like a restaurant that took over an existing restaurant space and went and spent about $17 on Thai themed wall art. If you took down the two or three things that look Thai, they could literally turn it into a taco place or a pizza joint in a half-hour.  You don't come here for the ambiance.  They were also playing Miley Cyrus on the speakers, and I'm about 75% sure she's not Thai.  

Service SUCKS!  It's got to be a Mom & Pop shop and the kids were forced to work here.  The one girl waitress I had was pleasant, but didn't seem to grasp basic concepts - like bring out both my and my wife's plates out at the same time, not 5 minutes apart. C'mon, man!  The two young guys?  Pretty sure they'd rather be out at the skate park.  Clearly, they're not into the whole \"customer\" thing.  I did see \"Mom\" (if it is a family biz), and she was super-nice.  We told her how much we loved the food.  We left out how incompetent her kids were.

At some point, Thai House has to invest in:

(a) a beer & wine license, 
(b) at least a basic atmosphere upgrade, 
(c) service staff that actually give a shit.  

But damn, that food was amazing!"}
{"text":"It was one of those nights that we were too busy to cook and had waited way to long to want to go our and pick something up so I decided we should try Thai House since it is close to our house and they deliver. When I pulled up the menu all i could think of was all the different things I had read about on yelp and how all these different Items were amazing, the menu is great and has many many options, I then decided to make my choice.. I went with the Red Curry with Vegetables and chicken... wow wow what is this... I get to select the heat.. Lets go with a 10 I love HOT!

The Curry was hot and super tasty and my wife ordered the Pad thai which was also spot on, the only other thing that we ordered that was also perfect was the Chicken Satay with peanut sauce. This place is now one of the go to locations when we just don't want to leave home and we are in the mood for some great Thai food."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened? ? Did they change chefs? I ordered the green curry which has been my favorite for 4 years, it sucked! Everything I ordered sucked. It tasted like crappy Chinese food. I'm so sad... lucki thai is now my go to thai place."}
{"text":"Thai is one of my all time favs. Thai House is unpretentious. They perform time after time after time. Never been unhappy with any menu selection. Excellent flavors, nice plating, good quantity for the money."}
{"text":"People came and went. They picked up to-go orders, paid their bills, got on with life. They loved, had children, died, were reincarnated as sea creatures. 

I just sat there. No menu, no water, no service. I was wearing a shirt and shoes, too.

Finally, we were the only people left in the restaurant, and the servers just started cleaning other tables. No menus. No waters. No acknowledgment of being alive. Considering I wasn't wearing my invisibility cloak, I don't really get what was going on.

I won't go back, but if I did, they probably wouldn't even realize I was there...
*cries under invisibility cloak*"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place twice and ordered carry out  several times.  The food is flavorful and delicious, and the prices are decent. You can bring a large group or you can sit at booths along the sides of the large, clean, divided room.  Seating is far enough apart to not give you a crowded feeling.  The decor, though colorful is a tad on the low-cost, plain side, but that is no problem since you come here for a tasty, affordable meal.  The menus are \"bound\" in colorful fabric with metallic threading. The waitresses are pleasant and personable and dress in colorful Thai clothing.  

There is a variety of foods on the menu, mostly Thai but with some recognizable Chinese offerings. Most meals seem to range from around 8 dollars to perhaps 15 but you could order an appetizer for less.  I was a little short on cash but had no problem finding something for 8.95 (a delicious curry).  I will definitely come back and bring friends.  By the way, there is ample parking in the large plaza.

Update 2/278/08  They have updated their design to include musical entertainment in the form of karaoke and professional performers. For a while they've had a sign touting their house performer, \"Skip Eaton (\"skip eatin'? I don't know if a guy with a name like that should be performing in a restaurant).  Everything else is the same - great food, friendly waitstaff."}
{"text":"Their panang curry is pretty amazing! The service here is also very good. No complaints here!!"}
{"text":"I've dined in and ordered carry-out from Thai House, but I seem to get more food when I carry out. Their Spicy Fried Rice is phenomenal. There is so much flavor and it is the best Spicy Fried Rice that I've had in the valley. To make it vegan-friendly, I order it with tofu and veggies, and omit the eggs. They will charge an additional $2 to get tofu & veggies; they will not allow you to order 1/2 tofu and 1/2 veggies, for some reason.  However, the only thing that truly peeves me is the spice level. Every time I've ordered, I have requested to have spice level 5, which is their hottest, but I end up with mild food every time. I am truly confused by this. I can always depend on Thai cuisine to deliver true spice, but they must be serving up some American, watered down version of spices.  If they can fix the spice issue, I'll be happy. I need it spicy!"}
{"text":"This place has really good food and a very good website to order anything on the menu including pictures.

The problem lies in customer service.  I initially called and was placed on hold for over 5 minutes before I discovered a website on the menu.  After well over an hour of ordering my food via the website, it still had not arrived so I called the restaurant again.  I spoke to 4 different people, none of which could speak much English and all of them asked for my information all over again.  It took until the 4th person I spoke to to find out that they had not even started my order yet and that it would take another long while before it would arrive.

Definitely try the pangang curry if you dare brave the customer sevice."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice, and for some reason this place always gets my delivery order wrong, even though it is done completely online and I type what I want clearly.  There is no person that does not speak clearly with a heavy accent to screw up your order, so I am guessing that they have a hard time reading instead.

As I have said in my other reviews, I don't eat a lot of Thai food, mainly because it is full of sugar.  I also can't deal with curries so my choices are limited.  I'm the first to admit that I'm quite boring when I order mostly pad thai.  And this place, does it way too bland for me, I prefer Pin Kaow's version to this.  

But the real reason why I'm giving this place the rock bottom review is that the last time I ordered from here, I got massively sick from the shrimp pad thai (I ordered tofu and extra vegetables but didn't get those with it either).  I admit that everything else is ok that I normally get (stuffed chicken wings, beef jerky, satay), but this was not so fresh.

I guess I don't understand why people love this place so much.  Maybe I'm just ordering the wrong things, but after seeing how they send out bad shrimp, my days of ordering Thai delivery not only here, but everywhere are pretty much over."}
{"text":"We got delivery and ordered the curry and war wonton soup which were both good. Only downfall was that the brown rice that we received with the curry was no bueno. Half of it was way over cooked and super crunchy - almost like they scraped it from the bottom of the pan."}
{"text":"Thought it was great. Asked how hot you wanted your food and everything. The food was great as well as the service. Don't be deterred by the outside appearance. Very nice on the inside."}
{"text":"When it comes to Asian food, Thai is my go-to. And when it comes to Thai food, I have my favorite, and it's Thai House in North Scotty. Their curries are full of flavor--panang chicken, spicy 3 is my favorite--and I've recently become borderline-obsessed with their pad thai. Never had a bad experience, and their food is very reasonably priced.

Go to Thai House. Do it. Do it now."}
{"text":"Thai house is MY house to go eat Thia food in town :) I love this place. It never fails to deliver every time we come here.

Favorites!
1) Crunchy egg rolls - Crunchy - Yummy
2) Tofu Pan Nang- Cocunut and curry based with veggies and tofu...my FAVORITE.
3) Padsieu noodles- beefy flat noodles with sliced beef. It is really good.
4) Tom Ka soup - spicy soup with coconut juice added. You can add chicken or beef..ext. Soooo good.
5) Chicken Satay - OMG the peanut butter sauce is amazing. If no one was looking I would just eat it up all by itself. YUM

This is by far the best Thia restaurant on the east side of Vegas. Food is always good, service is always good and if you are lucky they have live music (usually on the weekends)

BEST DEAL- they have awesome lunch specials for (~$5-7) for soup, egg roll, chicken wing and meal. Must go!

Love this place.....it's a restaurant staple in my books."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for my birthday and it was the worst service and food I had in a long time.  The food was unflavorful.  We ordered  egg rolls as an appetizer,  my friend  ordered  chicken  pad thai and I ordered  soup.  They brought out my soup before the egg rolls.   When we asked for the egg rolls  before the main course they took the soup back and brought the egg rolls.   After that they brought the soup and chicken satay.   When we said we didn't order the satay the waitress argued with us that we did order the satay.  After few minutes going back and forth she finally brought the pad thai.  The soup was not hot.  It was obvious it was not fresh.  I would not recommend this place.   If I could give 0 stars I would have."}
{"text":"We've ordered take out from Thai House twice and they are now our go to for Thai.  The panang curry, spice level 4, is awesome.  Great flavors and full of a good amount of meat and veggies.  It's a big container too, at $9.95 its a great value.  Our other favorite is the spicy noodles, spice level 3.  Again, lots of meat and veggies and fantastic flavors.  We think we've dialed in the level of spice we like, for us these levels give us nice heat without an overpowering \"my lips are on fire!\" burn.  Service is always prompt, ready in 15 mins or less from when we call, and the order is always packaged very well.  Two thumbs up for that alone!  To recap - great food, great prices, great service."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here for close to 4 years and up until today the food and customer service has been exceptional. 

I usually order between $15 and $25 for one order. Today I was buying food for my family to be delivered and spent about double that. For $50 including tip, I expect good food and the same level of customer service I would get as if I was sitting in the restaurant. 

I ordered the beef and meatball soup with large flat noodles like I always do. And like always I ask that they exclude the beef syrups and instead add more meatballs. It's never been a problem until today. 

When my order arrived I got two orders of half meatball soups with some type of noodle I didn't ask for. When I called to confirm, I was given the run around and asked that the owner or manager call me back. I was told that the order was a mistake by the girl on the phone but I shouldve only paid $5 per order of soup because it was minus the beef strips. Wrong. I was charged full price. 

When I relayed these issues to the owner I was courteous and let him know that the food was always good but that my order wasn't how I normally receive it. He informed me that I had been wrong for close to four years and that they had been screwing up orders for that amount of time as they price is the same whether I order with or without beef strips. 

Odd that all of a sudden when I have an issue has everything been wrong all these years. 

Customer service was lacking and so shall my business. 

I shouldve ordered the pizza instead."}
{"text":"A big fan of their restaurant on 1155 S Power Rd in Mesa. So we've been meaning to try another one. 
This one is at least 2 times bigger, and w/o the cramped feeling. Prices are $1 or $2 more expensive than the Mesa store, but still the same great Quality and good quantity. Wait staff was nice and efficient. Will not hesitate to come back.

Sadly, for anyone with high cholesterol, they said they use vegetable oil (Mesa). Will ask to see the jug of oil next time. Can anyone verify this ?"}
{"text":"I have had my fair share of Thai Restaurants and Thai House is hands down the best Thai joint in Vegas.

I'm a creature of habit so I come here for one thing only, their Yellow Curry. I've had it with chicken, pork, and beef. All types have been delicious but pork would have to be my favorite. The dish comes with chunks of potatoes, sliced carrots, onions, and white rice on the side. The flavor is so rich and you can definitely taste the coconut milk. The broth itself is far from watery but it's not too thick, I promise you it's absolute perfection. You can choose your spicy-ness level 1-10, I always shoot low because it tends to be spicer than anticipated. 

I also love their Thai Beef Jerky appetizer. The texture is far from tough, again the flavor is amazing. Comes with bits of cilantro on top and a side of sauce that's salty with a hint of spice. I'm pretty sure it's fish sauce.

I've been coming to Thai House for a few years now and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"So it's the exact same menu as their place on Power / Southern only $2 more expensive for every dish. They do have gluten-free soy sauce and everything can be made gluten-free on request, just like their Mesa spot."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular.  While doesn't seem to be a lot of competition, just a standard Chinese and Thai food menu. Worth trying again."}
{"text":"Have always been happy with my experience here. Have tried spring rolls, pangang curry, green curry, pad thai and thai tea. All delicious."}
{"text":"This right here! This Thai Resturant right here is GREAT! I had Tom Yum Gai soup (whoa) and chicken satay (I almost proposed to the cook)."}
{"text":"Really, really good Thai food. Best Pad Thai and yellow curry I've had in a while!!! Spice level was perfect and on par with what I asked. Getting shrimp is a good choice as you get loaded up on shrimps."}
{"text":"I've gone here a few times. I love how they deliver. I'm addicted to curry. The food here is soooo good! My only suggestion would be to get a 3 on the spicy scale. I keep getting 4 and it's as hot as a 10. Still so bomb I'm eating it anyways"}
{"text":"Busy location and attentive staff.  I ordered the Grilled Beef dish which was a good sized portion.  The spiciness ranged from 1-5 and they accommodated my order to perfection!  Clean restaurant.   I'll go back"}
{"text":"I was unsure about going to the Thai House.... When we sat down, I thought there was no way it was going to be good. Boy was I wrong! This restaurant was awesome! Their food ranged from not that authentic (but super tasty) with their dumplings and spring rolls, to the extremely authentic kao soi that tasted just like the one I had in Thailand (maybe even better)... They did a good job of making the food spicy and everything we ordered was good. Their drunken noodles were tasty, smokey, spicy, and definitely an item to order again. We tried a beef dish that was very savory and good, but the best dish was the kao soi.... A delicate, yet rich coconut curry broth with chewy egg noodles.... It was crazy good. This place is not in my neighborhood, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great panang curry!  I pretty much always get this dish at Thai restaurants and this is one of the best ones I have had. Great service and prices, too."}
{"text":"OMG, it is my first time going to this restaurant and I just ordered the Stir-Fry Mixed Vegetables with Chicken and I am blown away at how flavorful this meal is; not to mention it was $6.95 for lunch with soup, potsticker, and egg roll. I am hooked."}
{"text":"Don't come here! 
I have given this place many chances as my bf seems to like it. I have to say the food is very inconsistent. Sometimes everything tastes fresh and other times like it's been sitting in the back for too Long. Also, every time we come here we order level 3/10 spicy and 2 times I could barely eat anything because it was way too spicy. The first time it happened a few months ago our regular server replaced our entree with a new one. Last night it happened again and when I said it was way too spicy the server just said sorry and asked if we wanted our check and then forgot to bring us our check!! Like I said, inconsistent food and service. Don't think I will be back considering the many Thai food places in Vegas."}
{"text":"4.5 stars please! I traveled to Thailand a few years ago and became an avid Thai food snob in my quest for authentic Thai food in Las Vegas. This place really nails it when they whip up their Panag Curry, Pad Thai noodle, and Pad See Ew. 

It's really good! The Panang curry is a must try. 

A little funky with the stage and the live music, but it's kind of charming in a cheesy way."}
{"text":"I have been a very frequent visitor of Thai House. It is right down the street from my house and it is a very good Thai restaurant. I have been to places that have similar quality of food, but the owners of this place make it that much more special. I have been eating Thai food for most of my life and I will continue to eat at Thai House."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food. Frequent this place often. Panang curry is the best. Spicy sweet at the same time."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I love their panang chicken. I like to add pineapple to it and it makes it delightful. Their lunch chicken special is also very good, and great prices! Highly recommended place for thai food in the scottsdale area."}
{"text":"Love this place. I go a couple of times a month. I generally get the massaman curry. Delish!"}
{"text":"The service here isn't that great, but it's what I would expect for a casual Thai place that serves a lot of takeout orders. The food was great and came in immense portions with plenty of leftovers for two more meals. I had the green curry which came with plenty of chicken and veggies, though it didn't have the usual eggplant which is my favorite. The dining area was clean and the staff were friendly. I would definitely come back when staying in the area."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the valley and we have tried A LOT of places.  Huge portions.  One Entree is easily enough for two people. Have tried the Yellow, Green and Panang curries- all AMAZING."}
{"text":"We were planning on going to their other place near Frank Lloyd Wright, but they're closed on Sundays. Had the Tom Yum soup, spicy noodles with shrimp and the \"yellow\" curry with tofu. It was my 3rd time here (5 for the other one), Good (really a 3.5), but the soup was a bit thin and spicier than a 3 on their scale, although 3's were perfect for the other dishes. Will still come back, but prefer the other, plainer one. I'm still searching for the perfect (crispy) Mee Grob..."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. There is a decent amount of items on the menu and the staff is pretty friendly and on top of what they are doing, until it gets busy, then the service is slower but not horrible."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Rocking during lunch hours and for obvious reasons...you can't get better Thai food in the area

If lunch is packed, get your meal to go. 

Pad Thai is to die for.  Delish!!!!"}
{"text":"Never dining here again no matter how good the food is....My sister got a stomach ache and mild food poisoning from lunch. We had tom yum soup and the mongolian beef. NEVER again!!! SO SAD!"}
{"text":"Well I just happened to need a cool spot (I do ac repair) so I stepped in and decided to eat lunch. I ordered the spring rolls and the broccoli wok with the shrimp beef chicken combo. Wow the flavor is amazing. He heat desired is selectable based on what you want. I ordered one serving but it's certainly enough for two people to enjoy. The portion size was huge.  

Try it and I think you'll also be amazed. Price point was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Best wonton soup! Best gyoza! Best sweet and sour chicken I've had!  Very nice service too"}
{"text":"I had the Green curry with chicken, it is fantastic. I love the waitress and everybody there, they are very friendly. Nice music, not too loud. I would recommended to everybody."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been on the hunt for an amazing Thai place for atleast a year. 
This might just be the place! Food was Amazing, came out extremely quick, and the service was equally great. 

While eating atleast 10 people came to get to go orders, so it's clearly not just us that loved it. 

If you're on the hunt for Thai, check this place out"}
{"text":"The food here is good but can sometimes lack in consistently. I tend to order just a couple of dishes (pad see ew in particular), and the amount of greasiness and portion size seem to vary widely with any given visit. On my last visit for take away, I found the portion of pad see ew to be on the small size but my order of spicy eggplant was nearly twice as big, not including the rice. 

Otherwise, the food is usually tasty and the spicy-ness seems spot on with their 0-5 scale (I order a 3). And, as with any Thai food, eating in makes the food taste a bit more fresh than take away."}
{"text":"I love Thai house. This is mine and my fiancée  favorite Thai place, we've been coming for years. Back in the day I always played it safe with pad Thai and lemon chic but now we've expanded to the Tom nam soup, freah rolls, spicy eggplant mint, duck curry, Kung pao, spicy chili mint and red curry. I can't say one bad thing. Everything tastes awesome!! Flavorful, spicy and hot. Adding fried tofu to any dish makes a great veggie option for all of us vegetarians. A must for all Thai lovers!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed, my go-to for yellow curry. Always great whether dine-in or take out. 
Service is always friendly and prompt and generous portion size.
Great menu selection. Since I go for the yellow curry I'm not up on a lot of the other selections but my dining companions have never been disappointed with their selections"}
{"text":"The service sucks, I am from out of town, was brought to this place by a friend.  We sat there for 15 minutes before anyone came over.  However people came in after us and got served right away.  I assumed since these folks were not black it was OK to get to them first.  We left."}
{"text":"My fave Thai place! Their beef panang is the best. I've tried beef panang elsewhere, but nothing compares to theirs (I've also tried the chicken panang, but liked the beef better). Their Seafood Combo (I think that's the name), Pad See Ew, combination fried rice and Papaya salad are also good. I also like that they have spice racks in every table, that way you don't have to ask, and you could order \"no spice\" then just add the spice later esp when sharing. Oh, and don't forget their Thai Tea! I don't know if they have boba for it, I never asked, but their Thai tea is the best in town.
The service is good too. The owners are usually in there and would approach customers to make sure everything's going well."}
{"text":"I've gotten lunch take out here a few times. The only thing I've tried is the drunken noodles. While I think they are pretty decent, I have been having serious issues getting the right spicy-nes. The first time I got them, I asked for level 3 spicy. Their spice meter goes from 0-5. I love love hot and spicy Thai food, however these noodles were practically inedible. Yet, they were so delicious at the same time I devoured the entire thing. And I felt like I was going to die later, as my stomach felt like a fishnet stocking...
The second time I ordered them I asked for level 2 spicy. This time they were not spicy at all. At all!! They were so bland. I mean, they still tasted good, but were missing that drunken noodle kick! So, at this point I don't know what to do. Obviously every cook there must have a different idea of what each number means. 
The last time I ordered from here, I simply said drunken noodles. I didn't specify a spicy level. I figured maybe this would give me the perfect in between spicy that I so desired! Well, when I got them, they were more bland than the level 2. And tasted kinda weird. 
I will give them another try as they are right across the street from my work, and I hope we can work out our spicy issues! 
4 stars for the service, they're really friendly here
2 stars for the food, until we can work out our issues
And 4 stars for the convenience!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and tend to prefer this location over the one on Shea. 

The food is consistently flavorful and served in generous portions.   The whole family loves it - great for carry out and leftovers or for dining in.  The chicken satay, pad Thai, and Panang curry are our favorites.   I haven't found anything on the menu that wasn't great. 

Always served fresh and hot.  Service is friendly."}
{"text":"To: The Owner, Thai House

I wanted to bring my concern as a customer, to your attention.

I  have visited Thai House, Scottsdale, Pima and 101 location along with my family for a weekend lunch and we had a very pleasant experience. 

Thenafter, learnt that Thai House has a branch on Shea so we stopped by for grabbing some Thai Tea on one hot afternoon.

I am aware that Thai Tea is priced at $2.00 and with taxes totals to $2.16. But at this location, the cashier initially asked for $2.16 and then charged us $2.70. The difference in the two amounts is minimal, but was over charged for no reason? Had we dined, our bill could be easily manipulated with an amount of their choice?

I need an explanation on what basis the $0.54 was charged extra and no receipt was given on the transaction?

Thanks!"}
{"text":"First time ever having Thai food- it's amazing! I'm little nervous this place set high standards for Thai food now.

The actual restaurant wasn't all that fancy but it doesn't matter because the food was so delicious. It wasn't pricy either!

I had the mixed veggies with tofu (spicy) and green curry with tofu also spicy. Mmm, leftovers was just as great! 

If I lived here I would be a regular customer!"}
{"text":"Good food at a decent price. Only problem when I come here is it seems I am the only customer so not much on ambiance or social scene."}
{"text":"food was excellent. They have a variety to choose from. My favorite was the yellow curry with tofu. I ordered food here while having friends from out of town who are very picky about their food. Californians :) and they were happy. We had a ton of left overs and it was still good the next day"}
{"text":"Real and authentic thai for what I've had in Thailand or any other Asian country. Had egg rolls...good..pad see ew and green curry chicken good..best I've seen since moving here in June from Australia.
Land of awesome Thai food!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Orange chicken is stellar!

Great prices and portion size. Decent selection for lunch special too!

Always packed during lunch and very limited seating. 

You can choose how spicy you want it on scale 1-5. I have chosen 3&4 and haven't been blown away by the spice. Next time I'll ask for 5. Rumor has it, you can say Thai Spicy and they'll really make it hot!

I hear the curries are excellent but I've never been a big curry fan."}
{"text":"I am not from AZ I wanted Thai food. My friend recommended this place. I had the pad kee mao with beef. I did like the over all dish but I didn't eat the beef. It was the weirdest texture. It was almost like chewing on fat. Not high quality of meat at all. I had other friends try it just to see if it was me. They also thought it was rubbery. I would go back but I would avoid beef next time."}
{"text":"Yelp, thai delivery food and up came Thai House. Love online ordering! As of now. So I ordered from their main website, signed up, ordered and paid for bill by cc, easy and quick. Online ordering shows pictures of dishes n gives you options of spicyness, meats, and etc for certain dishes. 
We ordered 2 orders of chicken pad thai and an order of fried bananas. The c.pad thai was flavorful with a little sweet, kick. The fried bananas were delicious, had a nice crunch with sweet banana filling. 
Easy online ordering, good timing delivery and good chicken pad thai."}
{"text":"Randomly drove by this place one day and boy were we glad! Our food is always great, good portion size and great prices. I will say that we did try the spring rolls last time and beware if you don't like mint. They were stuffed with mint leaves and it overpowered everything else. I always get the Pad Thai and it's amazing!!"}
{"text":"I normally pick up food from Thai House but today i ordered delivery from eat24 from Thai House and it showed up 30 minutes later . So fast . Still hot. And the food was delicious as normal. Plus the delivery guy was really nice. 
Super refreshing. 
I had just ordered from a different thai restaurant  that i waited 2 hours for and never showed , so when i ordered from Thai House i was starving . The app said the food would arrive by 12:53 which was surprisingly fast, only 45 minutes so i was excited.  Then the food showed up even sooner than anticipated. Took 30 minutes from when i ordered it. Insane. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Cute, quaint, simple, honest. I really like this place.

The pad thai isn't the best I've had, but it's still very good. The portion is large, and the price is reasonable. The green curry is really good. I don't think it's too sweet, and there's tons of vegetables in addition to protein. I loved the cook on the tofu. I did ask for medium heat and I felt that I was given mild. I have a high tolerance for spiciness so maybe that's why it didn't seem as hot to me. In the future, I'll definitely get 5/5 on the heat scale.

The peanut sauce is really thick, creamy, and sweet. I personally prefer peanut sauce to be a little spicier, but my husband went crazy for it. He couldn't get enough!

Overall, very nice. If I'm in the area, I will stop by again."}
{"text":"Seriously, this is my favorite Thai restaurant in the valley. My boyfriend and I come here all the time and he loves it just as much as I do. 

It's always clean and well maintained and the staff is friendly and attentive.

And the food? The food is SO delicious! And consistently so. And it's served HOT. And they actually comply with your preferred spiciness level. 

My favorite dish is the Kung Pao. I usually add tofu and shrimp but I've also tried it with salmon. So goooood!

The portions here are enormous enough that honestly I can have leftovers TWICE off of one meal. And at their reasonable, fair prices, that is amazing. My only complaint is that I NEVER have room to try their dessert!"}
{"text":"If i could put negative stars i would. Our garlic mushroom chicken tasted like dirt and some sort of cleaner so we sent it back and said we didnt want it. Moving on to the yellow chicken curry.... My son had a small plate but said it didnt taste good and my daughter decided she wanted to try it so she stirred it and up floats a HUGE COCKROACH cooked into it. All the owner could say was \"Sorry\" We all wanted to throw up. My wife's family said we should contact the health department to have this place looked into before they get somebody really sick."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Thai restaurant I have ever tried. Their pork larb has so much flavor. I couldn't get enough of it. Everything we tried was on point and it did not disappoint us. I would definitely recommend coming here if you are craving Thai food and want to leave smiling. I would also recommend getting mango sticky rice at the end of your meal because you will die and go to heaven. 
Our meal was 
Spicy basil pork - bursting with flavor 10/10 
Pork larb - 1000000/10 I love this dish much we even got a party size of it the next day 
Fried chicken - it was very juicy and very tender I enjoyed every bite 10/10 
I will be back for more Thai food from Thai house I love everything from here. 
Service was very friendly and attentive (:"}
{"text":"Thai House has an odd mix of factors for me.  The food is fairly good and portions are generous for the price.  I'm not qualified to comment on how authentic it is for Thai, or if it is too Americanized, but I enjoy the food here.  Parking is easy too.  that's where the positives end.

Service is horrible - slow, inattentive, and a lot of mistakes such as not writing down our table's order and then surprise, surprise... the food that came out is inaccurate.  Place is very small with limited seating, and there's usually a wait on busy nights.  bathrooms are atrocious.  Floors are often dirty, and the decor seemed to be thrown together on a very limited budget.  Any customer will wonder if the kitchen is any cleaner than the public area that customers are allowed to see.  The size ties into the service problem in some ways as well, as we witnessed on multiple occasions there's only 1 waiter and 1 waiter-assistant for the entire restaurant.  Obviously they can't keep up, so drinks aren't refilled, tables sit for a long time to get a check, food orders are taken out of order from when people were seated.  But, I suppose that means the 1 waiter makes a lot in tips, even if several customers are unhappy."}
{"text":"This is excellent thai/chinese food. I eat here for lunch generally at least once every week and a half. Nice quick and cheap food. I've probably tried seven or eight dishes on the menu, and they have all been quite good. You can choose your spiciness level so no worries about blowing up your taste buds."}
{"text":"We came with a large group, with a reservation made 1 week in advance.  The food was pretty good, but the staff was ill-prepared for our group on a Saturday afternoon.  It seemed like there was one person working, so it took a long time to get water, orders, food.  I would not go here again with a large group."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this place is so good! I had an overnight there, and didn't want to stray far from the airport. The staff at the airport suggested Thai House. I didn't expect much from a hole in the wall nearby, but whatever. 

It was so good! And the portion are huge! I still have leftovers! The peanut sauce made me cry so I ordered a side to go. I asked for no onions, and got no drama at all!!!

The staff was very nice. We got in close to close and got caught up in our conversation and stayed a bit after. They weren't pushy or rude. If I lived nearby, I'd go here all the time. I live in the SF bay area, with a higher concentration of Thai than any other location in the states, and I haven't found much as good as this place!"}
{"text":"The only redeeming qualities this place has is the delivery (and even that sucks most of the time) and the fact that they carry a food my husband loves. 

We've ordered from here a number of times, with varying levels of satisfaction. Here are the main issues that keep repeating themselves:

-After I had my daughter, my ability to handle spicy food lowered dramatically. As such, I order everything as mild as possible. I understand that Thai food is spicy, but \"mild\" shouldn't be so spicy that I can't even eat it. This happens more often than not, and it seems to depend on who is doing the cooking. 

-They rarely deliver the right things/everything. We've received parts of other people's orders, and we often don't receive all of our order. 

-The food is substandard and overpriced."}
{"text":"What a nice little Thai restaurant! We have been here a few times, and each time the food has been high quality and really good. We got the pad thai with tofu and the sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken. They only use white meat chicken and they use nothing but fresh vegetable's for all of their dishes.  There soup is also to die for, especially the Tom Kai Gai.  The portions are generous, the prices are reasonable, and with fast and efficient service you really can't go wrong here.  This is also an excellent place for take out, they always say 15 minutes, but it's ready in about 10 minutes.  And, if you go to their website they have a 10% off cupon that you can use.  Another cool thing is that you can specify how spicy you want your order, anywhere from 1-5 (5 being the spiciest), which is really a nice feature to customize your order.  Whoo, yay Thai House!

4.5/5"}
{"text":"This place is very cozy and home style. Amazing authentic Thai food. Coconut soup, curry fish, beef noodles with veggies all amazing! The 5 banana ice cream with the mango sticky rice desert was awesome! Highly recommend if you are a foodie looking for an authentic experience. Make sure you let them know you are ready to order- you do have to speak up, use a little common sense and you will love this place. Decent prices too."}
{"text":"So I've become a regular here, the food is amazing, I always say I need to take pictures but I can't seem to take time to do it. I dig right in, my fav is the Panang chicken level 6, the summer roll, and yellow curry chicken level 5! I come in once a week at least to get my fix, the staff has become better and better every time. Hands down best that I've had in Scottsdale and the price is just perfect. They have lunch specials so call and ask for them!!! Must try!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden, but definitely worth the find.  It is located in the Smith's shopping center on the corner of Silverado Ranch and Maryland Parkway. 
I have frequented for lunch often.  I have also ordered take out for a convenient dinner to enjoy at home. 

They have great food, great value, and great service. 
I LOVE the red curry chicken and pad Thai. (usually get the spice around a 5!)
A great place to try!"}
{"text":"I've had hit-and-miss experiences with Thai House.  The pad thai was palatable although not the best I've had.  I also ordered the salad with lime, onions, peanuts, etc.  The entire thing was soaked in bitter lime juice (not fresh) and was completely inedible.  I would try it again just to have a definitive opinion and because the options for Thai are few and far between on the West Side!"}
{"text":"Have been to Thai House several times and have not been disappointed.  The Panang is very good, a level 5 is not spicy, and i'm not a huge fan of spicy food.  Reasonably priced, the lunch special is highly recommended, but get there early because they do seem to be steadily busy during the week."}
{"text":"This place has great food and the people were very friendly. Definitely a 5 star rating. Try the Thai House fried rice !"}
{"text":"I had the house salad without croutons. The salad had generous amount of warm chicken. Bagged lettuce. Not freshly prepared. They might deny   this but it is not possible for lettuce edges to turn brown that fast.   The boiled eggs have green rings around the yoke. Either they do not know how to boil eggs so they are attractive or they don't care to do it. It is basic and shows that they are not serious. 

Still not a bad salad. Just not great."}
{"text":"Love the spring rolls! The food is what you mainly come here ( I know- sounds weird) but if you are like me and enjoy a little ambiance with you dinner, this little spot does not provide much. The waitresses have always been really pleasant and work hard. They are quick in serving you, so if you are really hungry, go here and they will fill your belly with some yummy thai goodness. If you are thristy for a beer, go to Four Peaks around the corner because they do not serve any liquor.
 I definitely would order take-out from this little spot anytime!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this restaurant on our search for a great Thai restaurant in Henderson. We called in our order and we were told it would be 30 minutes. No problem... We Arrived there 30 minutes later and were told the food was not ready and it would be another 10 minutes. Not a great first impression but the waitress did apologize. So I decided to wait in the restaurant... 20 minutes go by and at this point I'm getting irritated... I ask the waitress if our food was ready and she replied with another apology \" it's almost ready.\" About 5 minutes later my food is brought out to me. They obviously forgot to prepare my food until I arrived there. Not good service in my book. Now on to the food..
1) We decided to try the spicy mint chicken-- it had a layer of oil on the bottom.. Not very appetizing.
2) Vegetable fried rice-- surprisingly was pretty good.
3) Thai Mongolian beef-- very fatty

All in all... The food and service will not have me returning back. Sigh... My quest is still on."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Scottsdale. The red curry is dope and the Tom Ka Gai is superb."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get thai with my friends. The staff is friendly, the prices are right, and the portions are big!"}
{"text":"When you walk in it feels weird. Like someone is using the place as a front for a different kind of organization. But that's cool, it adds to the ambience if you look at it the right way. You can pretend you're a secret agent in a movie and the servers are extra attentive because they're afraid for their lives. Yeah, the service is really good even though everything feels dodgy. I am really stuck on the Tom Yum Soup hot pot right now and their Thai Tea is really big and super sweet. (It scares me how sweet it is, so much sugar!) This is a pretty low-key simple place and it took a bad experience at another Thai place for me to realize how much I like this place and just how many times I've eaten here and brought guests with nary a bad experience. 
They give you generous amounts of food (something I personally get very picky about) and are very convenient in that you can order out. :) They have a nice variety on their menu as well. Gosh, I even turn to their menu right when I get the flu."}
{"text":"Heart be still I loved this place. Way better than I expected. I had the spicy noodles and they were delicious, flavor great and quality was on point. For desert the sticky rice with mango, I dream about it now. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for Thai food. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Always excellent!  The panang is my favorite, best I've had anywhere.  Always fast and ready when I arrive."}
{"text":"My sister was craving Thai food and we needed to go somewhere cheap and close by and Thai House was our ticket. 

The ambiance is non existent. It feels a bit like a food court, but tiny. (What is this? A food court for ANTS?) The service was prompt, polite and friendly. My sister and I both got lunch specials, the spicy chicken something or other and the garlic chicken respectively. Both dishes were ok, nothing too special.

The saving grace is definitely the Thai iced teas and the hot and sour shrimp soup. So good! I love the burning sensation in the back of your throat when you drink something spicy and that's exactly what I got. The touch of lemongrass really completed the overall flavor. 

When my sister ordered her lunch, she asked for maximum spiciness. We were sadly, sadly disappointed. It wasn't even moderately hot. I was confused and thought that they might have messed up the order, but after cruising the other reviews here on Yelp, I guess this place doesn't really do spicy.

I've had better Thai food, but if I wanted some tea and soup during my lunch break, I would go here."}
