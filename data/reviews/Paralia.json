{"text":"Such a shame. The atmosphere is beautiful and the servers are great. Unfortunately the food doesn't live up to the gorgeous restaurant or high prices. $20 appetizers and $40+ mains should be rave-worthy, but they're no better (and sometimes worse) than what you get on Danforth for half the price. We only had one drink each and our bill came to $80/person. I don't mind spending that if I walk out saying it was totally worth it, but it wasn't anywhere near that. We ordered all the things others recommended on yelp, and didn't find any of them to live up to the recommendation or the price. Village salad was made with firm bland tomatoes (in tomato season!) and a brick of bland chalky goat cheese. Dumplings were tasty but a rip off at $5 each. Lamb spit roast was tough and bland ...left half of it on the plate. The cheesecake was tasty but not worth $12 and not worth visiting this restaurant. I will be surprised if this restaurant survives through this winter."}
{"text":"The service is quite slow (45 min wait for my food), the portions are small, and the prices are insanely high (you get charged for water). On the up side, the atmosphere is amazing, and the flavours of their food is on point . Next time I feel like paying for a 10$ beer bottle and a $30 appetizer, I will go again."}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment. I had heard that it was over priced and overrated but I ignored this as I assumed people were cheap complainers. They were right. The night started with our server telling us that over 60% of the menu was sold out. We placed our orders and the first two appetizers to come out were wrong. 40 minutes after the appetizers the waiter came out to tell us that the main courses three of us ordered were also sold out! We just told him not to bother paid for what we had eaten (including the wrongly served appetizers) and left. As we were leaving we saw what was supposedly sold out laying on ice. We were there a total of 2 hours. My female friend insisted on speaking to the manager after. I told her not to bother because if he had a clue the restaurant wouldn't be in such shambles... I was right he was totally indifferent and clueless (bald with glasses that sit low on the nose) The only good thing about this disaster was that Athens Pastries was next door. The serving staff there was having a good laugh as they frequently hear people filling up on their delicious snacks thrashing Trinity next door.  Don't waste your time with this beautiful hole. What a shame, such a waste. I'll be back when I see an \"under new management\" banner hanging out front. Until then \"Estiatorio Volos\" is the only high end Greek restaurant I'm visiting in Toronto. -5 stars"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious!!! The server Vanessa is the best. We trusted her to pick us everything family style and it was perfection.  We tries the Horitiaki salad with sesame encrusted feta, eggplant spread, Tina tar tar, smoked salmon baklava (my fav), grilled octopus with balsamic reduction (melted in your mouth), grilled shrimp (omg), asparagus, feta cheesecake and baklava shared by the 4 of us.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The food here was all amazing! Scallops were cooked to perfection; the best I've ever had. It was my first time trying octopus carpaccio - it was great. The restaurant was completely full for valentines day when my boyfriend and I ate here. Food came out at a decent pace, and service was excellent. All staff were so friendly and helpful. We loved that the wine server was actually knowledgeable about what they had to offer - he gave us a great recommendation.   No complaints at all - we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just misses.  I get the concept, Mediterranean feel, everyone share...very traditional, authentic Greek.  The decor is very, very nice and the location-excellent. One of the only beach view restaurants in Toronto.  Food is ok to just about average, and that's we're it really misses. In looking at the menu, I couldn't help but think of that line from My Big Fat Greek Wedding: \"what do you mean he don't eat meat? That's ok, I'll make lamb...\"  Yes, there's fish, but other than that, just one chicken dish, designed for 2, at $38. And marginal, at best. Good quality chicken but spices didn't make the dish stand out, rice was barely ok.  No veg.  Wine list limited, understandably, to Greek selections, but wine by the glass selection is very, very limited.  I concur with the other poster....wait staff are dressed like a bad extra in a movie. However our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu selections. There was just very little for someone who doesn't eat meat and the quality was enough to make us give it a miss next time  The decor and location may cause me to give it a try for a late night drink or coffee but not for dinner.  If they last a year, I'll be surprised."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good. We ordered a variety of dishes. I could honestly go back at least a half dozen times, order completely different things and still love it. Olives stewed with cinnamon sticks, grilled sardines stuffed with toasted slices almonds, eggplant-date paste with pine nuts, that's just a sample. Pita bread is baked fresh, very thin and soft, not the junk in supermarkets. Service was impeccable. My only complaint was we were all too full to try the dessert menu. Next time!"}
{"text":"So we decided to go Taverna after great reviews from our close friends, and the experience was exceptional.first I want to start off by acknowledging the decor and mood as being outstanding.   The appetizer s were great as well as the drinks. (Order the Cesar, they are the size of a fish bowl). The only problem  we did encounter was the time it took to get the main course. It took an hour and a half for the main course to arrive. After asking the waiter what had happened, we were told the size of the fish we had ordered was the problem. We do appreciate that the fact that they took care of the situation, however had we known before hand we would of simply ordered another dish. Overall experience was good and the service was great."}
{"text":"Went with 4 adults and 5 little kids after a fun day at the beach.  No reservation, no problem, they shifted and shifted and fit us with a table for 8/9 on the patio, positioning a heater at either end.    The reviews were off-base for our service experience.  Friendly, attentive, lots of food came out quickly for the kids.  Food was delicious, gyros, snapper, salads, pita, octopus, calamari.  Awesome.  Interior / Decor was on another level.  Very impressive execution.  Very proud to have this place in Toronto.  Great patio in a great setting."}
{"text":"Last night I had one of my best meals in Tdot. Chris Kalisperas is doing brilliant things at Paralia. The food is fresh, gorgeous upscale inventive Greek yet it still respects tradition. I had a wicked started of grilled haloumi en croute with warm grapes and micro mint. Crispy exterior and super tender lamb meatballs with chunky, herby tzatziki. A great array of beautiful fresh fish grilled simply to order and cooked to perfection. Don't miss the cool desserts like feta cheesecake with sweet pears and honey drizzle and crack crunchy ginger cookie."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!! The place looked great but the food is terrible. The only thing we could eat is the egg plant appetizer and the french fries. The waitress was so unprofessional and incredibly rude."}
{"text":"The atmosphere on this place is pretty nice and the decor inside is pretty classy and upscale. The service is superb and the wait staff and friendly. The food is hit and miss but overall not worth the price and not particularly fresh.   Grilled calamari was excellent as were the appetizer spreads, in particular the zucchini one. The feta cheesecake (if that's your thing) is fantastic. The lamb roast is tasty and succulent.  On the other hand, the sea bass was just OK and rather bland (it also arrived lukewarm). The pork roast was a bit dry and bland. Most of the other food we sampled was unremarkable as well.  Given the prices this place charges as well as the absurd parking fee, I can think of many better restaurants (especially if you enjoy Greek food) one can visit. Personally, I don't think I'd go back again as it's definitely a one-time only experience."}
{"text":"Décor: really wonderful, felt transported! Perfect host, great table as requested when reserving, comfortable furniture, and enough room between tables for privacy and service. Innovative yet sophisticated surroundings, elegant Greek \"beach like\"nterior. OK, lose the IKEA lanterns  but everything else...spot on! Well done!  Food: good, not outstanding but tasty and good selection...Having said that, scallops were delicious...reminiscent of Coquille St Jacques,  mousaka, fantastic, ever, average Horitaki salad except for delicious crusted feta on top, lobster claws were OK, cocktail sauces, average at best. Out of sea urchin. But we happened upon \"buck a shuck\" oyster night, so just had to have a dozen of those too!  Oh yes, a spicy feta dip with pita...good too!  Wine list: Long! Way too many Greek wines. Extremely top heavy too! Story goes like this:  After a bit of a wait, our server finally took our first selection,($50.)\"good choice\"! Server then came back to tell us, they did not have this one;  lobster claws eaten, time ticking, no wine! OK, 2nd choice,( $77.) , another \"good choice\". More time goes by, yet another dish served, where is the wine? \"They are looking for it\"!?!  Okaaay...More time, another dish consumed, still waiting... Back she comes,  to tell us they found it, but it wasn't cold!. Would you  like a complimentary glass of plonk, (and it was), to have with our food (YEP) while it chilled!  OKaaay... More time goes by, she then arrives to tell us they just didn't have it!!! Seriously?! YEP! She was really embarrassed, given the passage of time,  and we were embarrassed for her too! I \"proposed\" they sell us a very familiar New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, (BTW: ALERT:triple mark up on wine; this New Zealand is $90! at this resto!!!) for the $77., which was the price of the long lost wine that we wasted so much time waiting for! This was more than fair, given mark up and time jerking us around! I also asked that the manager come over(he should have been there already!) to tell us the good news! We fully thought he would come over, of course agree, introduce himself and apologise for wasting so much of our time, ask if we were otherwise enjoying our evening!! It was my husband's birthday and we just wanted to have a nice bottle of wine!   Well, here's where it crashes and burns... some \"guy\" (no introduction) in a rumpled jacket, came over to tell us that \"we just can't do it guys\"! and left! What?! Really? Did that just happen? We were stunned!  Yeah ...Ya' coulda', and shoulda!! LOL.  He wasn't at all what we would've expected to be running this restaurant! We paid the $90. or whatever it was, for the wine, enjoyed it as we knew we would, and otherwise continued with our night! What a Jerk.   OK, that's our story. Enjoyed the night regardless. It became almost comical! The food was good. Atmosphere great! Server was nice. Wine list needs reworking. Probably will go back. Live in the area. I have a few ideas for them though, in the dead of winter, when they are rattling around this huge space, wondering how to draw more people in!! A drycleaner, for starters!"}
{"text":"We went here for a special occasion and loved it.  The service was outstanding, our waiter was amazing and took the time to explain the choices on the menu to us.  He gave us a few suggestions, all of which were really good.  The decor and open concept worked here.  The windows were open and you could feel the breeze coming off the lake.  This place is a bit pricey so we wouldn't go there every week.  Overall we thought it was the best meal we've eaten in a long time and would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Why is it, the more expensive the restaurant, the smaller the food portions?  This may be the most gorgeous looking restaurant I've ever seen, but like many super high end places, this restaurant left us needing to stop for sliders on the way home after spending big dollars on a tiny piece of fish.  I know that places like this thrive in some locations, and all the best to those who are into that sort of thing, but as an investor, I wouldn't put my money in Paralia if asked.  Way out in the east end at Woodbine Beach they are not going to draw the high rolling out-of-towners who stay at the Royal York, Trump Plaza etc. and local big spending Toronto diners will also likely stick to downtown where there action is.  Don't get me wrong however.  The owners did the right thing to trash the old and grungy Boardwalk Pub with it's cheesy molded plastic chair/table combos on the patio (like Tim Horton's décor).  But they went too far to the other extreme on the restaurant scale.  My prediction is that Paralia will transform again over the winter of 2014-15 into a nice looking and comfy place where you can get a chicken souvlaki plate with rice and Greek salad for 20 bucks.  Then the place will be packed.  A final word of advice to the owners:  don't forget, when you serve the Classes you eat with the Masses.  And vice versa."}
{"text":"It was not a good experience. The food is not worth the money.  The service shows the poor quality."}
{"text":"Colorful decoration and nice location; however, the waiter wasn't friendly at all. He didn't split the bill among us (group of 15) and we had to do that by ourselves. Despite that the food was good."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty, but EXPENSIVE. And the service was SLOW. Took around 90 minutes after ordering for our meal to show up - grilled sea bass, grilled shrimp, Horta, fries, mushrooms. None of these items should take any more than 30 minutes to cook. Our server kept assuring us that the food was coming right out - it took 45 minutes after the first time he promised. We were so hungry, we asked him to just bring the side of fries right away. He laughed, saying that the food would be RIGHT out, but said he'd being the fries immediately. The fries arrived 20 minutes later. The food, 15 minutes after that. No apology. No acknowledgement of how long it took. Every other table around us seemed to be annoyed for the same reasons.  Group of 3, bill came to nearly $250!! We asked for a bit of bread. They charged us $6 for 6 half-slices of toast. They said it was homemade olive bread, but it was tasteless and nothing special. For such an expensive restaurant, is it so much to expect that a few slices of bread be complimentary?  Such a beautiful, relaxing location, and for some reason, they BLAST euro dance music, to the point where we could not hear our waiter or each other. There was NOTHING relaxing about the choice of music and it killed the atmosphere.  Again, it was good, but worth half the money they charged. They want to charge high-end prices, but give you poor, slow service and nickel & dime you on the extras.  We won't go again."}
{"text":"Aesthetically the place is stunning! However the place has no concept of service and how to seat guests as we were told that there were no tables available on the patio and we could seat ourselves at the bar. As we waited for a table nobody came by to seat us so we decided to eat at the bar, while there were plenty of seats available throughout the restaurant.  The food came our faster then most fast food joints. We ordered a beet salad and gyros and the server just threw both plates in front  of us at the same time without even acknowledging us and asking if we needed anything else. Lets not talk about the pricing a 3\" piece of octopus for Market Price of $20!!! Yikes!!! Needless to say will never go back! I'll stick to the danforth for a more authentic Greek experience."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Manager is a douchebag. Made us pay for food we did not eat."}
{"text":"Good ambience. Loved the lake effect  Small portions   The tatzaki with the dip was very good Greek style  No ketchup with the fries . It's better u use the Greek style dip .   Alcohol wasn't very impressive . They give you Greek booze which is very light    The sea bass fillet was great  Moussaka was ok   The server was very friendly and trying to introduce us to Greek food  High end , pricey , small portions  But great food"}
{"text":"The servers will upsell and bring you food you do not order but think you want/need due to the size of your group (without telling you). While we ordered two of some dishes, we did not order two of everything, which is what we got. The trick is that some of the dishes are two orders on one plate so you have no idea there are two orders until the bill shows up.  This happened to us on four appetizers and a dessert. We ordered baklava. Did not realize until I got home and checked the menu after my annoyance that one order only comes with three (ours had six). Checked the bill and ta-da he charged us for two orders. Beware and check your bill. Other than that, great food."}
{"text":"The food: Was actually perfection. I've never, in all my restaurant going years tasted such an amalgamation of deliciousness in every bite. We had the village salad (interesting take on the classic). Octopus in aged balsamic glaze was very reminiscent of summer and the sea. Lamb - melted in your mouth, cooked to 100% perfect. We also had the Silver Porgy for the fish - oh em gee, wow, it could not have been grilled better. For dessert we had karithopita - again, very well done.   Ambiance - When i came in and heard the loungy music i though \"uh oh, this will get on everyone's nerves quickly\" but no! It fit in perfectly with what they were trying to create - hip, cool, fresh, dressy. The seating was very comfortable and I thought there was sufficient space between tables. It was also, so, so beautiful inside. It's so great to see that they put so much effort into the interior design, it was done with great taste.    Service: The choice of dress for the servers was questionable in my opinion but our server was knowledgeable and although struggled with the Greek pronunciation, she was able to make good recommendations and knew the menu very well. The hosts were genuinely happy to have had us over and that is so refreshing in our current \"k, thanks for paying, get out\" outlook on life. Although, maybe they seemed super friendly after we downed the bottle of assyrtiko, which, was also delicious.   All in all, best Greek food I've tasted in Toronto. I really enjoyed the meal, the ambiance and overall it was a very pleasant night.   Will return in the summer:)"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and was very impressed both times. Firstly, I'm glad they finally did something worthwhile with this property. The Boardwalk Cafe and Pizza Pizza were kind of a waste of space on such prime real estate.   Decor is amazing. Glad they moved the patio and windows  to the other side of the property where you can actually see the lake.  What I've tried in my two visits - I sampled everyone elses dishes too! Mousaka - amazing.  Village salad - has a huge piece of sesame crusted feta on top which is awesome, will be even better when tomatoes are in season.  Gyro - delicious and if you're hungry it's probably the most filling thing on the menu. Fish in chips are greek style and really good.  The cretan cheese appetizer pastries served on a bed of honey are to die for, what a combination!  The feta cheesecake with figs - wow!  The spread platter was yummy - although it could have been served with more pita (had to order more which was extra)  Good selection of wine. Service was good, staff were attentive although maybe could have been a little more personable. The manager was really personable and came to the table a couple of times to see how things were.   I feel like there should be a lunch menu for a casual bite when down at the beach during the day. It's pretty pricey and not somewhere that you can hit up often. But value is good for what you get. It's not your typical Greek restaurant.   I guess if you want a quick cheap bite you can hit up Athens Pastries next door."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! The food is Ok, a little pricy but worthy if you consider the view and the service. I like the chicken for two and the cocktail \"sangria rose\". Oh, the feta cheesecake is a must try! Take the waiter's recommendation, people here are really nice."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Trinity Taverna in late May.  I had made a reservation for 6 persons and we arrived on time at 7:30pm.  We were seated at a table in the crossroads of staff and patron traffic, poorly lit, next to the stairs and their open kitchen counter, facing an anonymous oil painting of a distressed criminal-like face.  We were told that we could not be seated elsewhere as that was the only available table.    The second indication that we had made a poor choice was the level of noise echoing and magnifying the diners' chatter, the kitchen's clatter and the irrelevant music; we had to raise our voices to hear the conversation at our table, adding to the overall booming atmosphere.   The third indication was the arrogance of the menu that pretended to be so first rate that the prices being shown as MP (market price) should suffice in helping us decide what to order; even the every-day shrimps had managed to rise in status to such exclusivity.   Fourthly, when the MP dishes arrived, the fish was average and the octopus very bland.   Fifth indication, the few over-priced \"common\" dishes like Moussaka, were sloppily prepared and tasteless; almost punishing the diner for not following the restaurant's affectations.  Finally, the sixth annoyance was the paranoid presence of men in suits hovering and observing as the charade unfolded.  On the positive side, Adita the waitress was the only pleasant experience that night; she was patient, attentive and engaging.  Otherwise, the restaurant was a disappointment."}
{"text":"There is a Greek paradise on our lakeshore.   Say what?  I couldn't believe my eyes either until I stepped inside Trinity Tavern.  The bright and breezy decor made me feel as if I was on a Greek island.  If you love grilled calamari as much as I do, you must try the grilled octopus here.  It was grilled to perfection.  Love the charred and balsamic glaze.  Tender and succulent.  This was my personal favorite.  I really appreciate the freshness that Trinity Tavern has to offer.  The grilled red snapper was awesome.  Love the charred crispy skin.  Tuna Tataki was refreshing, a perfect dish for summer.  The suckling roast pork with garlic, fresh oregano and thyme was also tasty.  Try sprinkling some sea salt and squeeze lemon juice on top for an extra depth of flavor.  Another favorite at our table was Lamb on a Stick.  Nicely charred but still juicy with a spicy kick.    For the dessert, we ordered Panna Cotta, Rizogallo (rice pudding), Yogourt Brûlée and Bougatsa.  Rizogallo was delicious.  The roasted chestnut puree gave just the right amount of sweetness.  Yogourt Brûlée was also my favorite.  It was fresh and light.  Outstanding service!  Our sever was extremely personable and knowledgable."}
{"text":"Meh. Food was ok- nothing standout, and particularly underwhelming considering the prices. The dips were overly salty. Greek dumplings and salads were quite nice, but the mains left me cold. Service was lackluster and inconsistent."}
{"text":"Save your money or don't be surprised when you're underwhelmed. Somehow everybody is supposed to be grateful enough for having a restaurant on the beach to act like it's perfectly normal for 1.5 cut-up tomatoes and a 2-inch brick of feta covered in sesame seeds to cost $12? And these folks were so caught up in trying to be a sexy, unique establishment that became the only Greek restaurant to uniquely not have any hummus on the menu. So you settle for the lamb 'skewers' the size of toothpicks and smile and thank the servers because you're Canadian, and again- sun! Beach! And after you paid your 5-star bill for the 2-star food, you begin walking down the sidewalk looking enviously at the lucky SOB's enjoying sausages from the hot dog stand."}
{"text":"While fresh, the seafood at this restaurant is so overpriced you'd be better off renting your own boat for the day and cooking your catch at home."}
{"text":"I am a little sad to see the old pub go from the beaches - it was just so nice and casual. It had a nice expansive (SUNNY) patio to which you could just down a couple of cold beers in your flip-flops and beach wear.  But now, Trinity Taverna is here and it certainly has a different vibe: clean whites, modern, patio that is smaller than what the old location has. During the night, the patio becomes shady because of the way it's situated.  This place is busy and it's recommended you make reservations...otherwise, you get one of two options: When it's cold, you have to make a decision sitting outside because they won't guarantee you a spot inside OR when the weather is nice (and especially when there is a football game), the patio is \"reserved\" and they will try very hard to find a table for you inside...  On to the food - what I really liked was one of their salads with feta cheese encrusted with sesame seeds. My mom and I are not fans of Goat Cheese, but the way they prepare it here, it is absolutely delicious. I would come back here just for that and glass of vino. I also really like how they showcase a lot of Greek Wines, which may not get as much attention as the French/Italian counterparts.   The waiter we had did a great job of recommending an average priced white which went very well with our meal. Don't hesitate to ask for recommendations - it's a good learning opportunity to try Greek wines!  My mom and I decided to try their fresh catch - we went for the Sea Bass and it was surprisingly a let-down. It was overcooked with no juices left.   Service, initially, was very good. He gave a lot of recommendations and was very engaging. However, towards the end of the evening,  we didn't see him again.  I think Trinity Taverna benefits from its location, and \"new-ness.\" But at the end of the day, the way the food is cooked here is average."}
{"text":"Food is great and the restaurant looks nice. A bit too casual for the price of foods here. Patio is good but it's close to the beach so there's a lot of noise from people yelling and stuff. Overall good experience, but too expensive."}
{"text":"Had lunch here last Saturday after noon , no valet parking as stated but that is a good thing,  Amble parking, front of restaurant quite impressively as well as inside along with the very large fish stream  Seemed empty not sure what it is like at night, we were seated right away, and served right away. The food was great but disappointed most of the menu was sea food, no souvlaki on menu, servings could have been bigger a nice quiet lunch nice setting  Dan"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday at a family member's suggestion. Nice open and airy atmosphere with lovely open-concept fish and seafood displays and tasteful décor. This is really what you're paying for when your fifty-dollar steak does not come with any side dishes. Mussels were moderately-priced and came with garlic crostini. Good menu, tasty, fresh, but pricy. Come here if: you need to impress a date, you want prime, sort-of-private patio space with some view of the lake, you want to lounge a bit, you feel like quality seafood, you want to take selfies with fabulously-coloured throw pillows on the restaurant benches. Don't come here if: you are saving money for university, you are looking for chow after running a marathon or doing an ironman, you want a quick and inexpensive snack."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant! Highly recommend to anybody looking for quality Mediterranean cuisine.  As you step inside Paralia you are immediately transported to a luxurious Greek oasis and greeted by friendly hostesses. The expansive outdoor seating area is beautifully arranged and sheltered for a private dining experience.   Our waiter was fantastic. Friendly, knowledgable and attentive. He made a fantastic wine recommendation.   We ordered pita with 4 dip and calamari to start and Halibut for the table(4 people) with sides of mushroom, roasted potatoes and rice with spinach as our entree. After we finished the bottle of wine we moved on to sangria which I am still raving about! Have to go back for more. :-)  Great experience. Left completely satisfied and looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I sampled several dishes At trinity taverna last weekend. The good ones were incredible, the ones I didn't like were very bad.  For example, the cold seafood platter was not fresh. That's a HUGE no no. But the grilled octopus was absolutely phenomenal. 5/5 dish!  The Mediterranean sea bass was fine. A bit bland. The Tarama dip was made with smoked salmon, which nobody enjoyed.  The warm olive appetizer was incredible. So tasty.  The lamb skewer appetizer was super disappointing! Dry, flavourless lamb served in a pita. Skip this. The Moussaka was very yummy. As was the feta cheese cake. I questioned feta cheese in cheese cake form, but the result is a rich creamy cheesecake that does not taste like feta at all. A few bites is enough.  Our server was helpful and friendly. But the service was a bit slow. Be prepared to be there a while.  For the price, I thought it would be much better food. Also I was really surprised by the lamb. I mean, it's a greek restaurant!"}
{"text":"Note:  I already wrote this and Yelp's software did not post.  I eat out frequently and I call it like I see it...I look for value when spending my money and have no problem spending on a decent meal..   I'm not quite sure where these high ratings are coming from..You need to get out more if this is place is high on your list..  They've dumped a Sh**ton into this place, it's beautiful and without a shadow of a doubt they're trying to make it back-fast in this trap.  And they're counting on as many suckers as possible to make it happen.  Nice place- reminds me of an all-inclusive resort restaurant- it wasn't busy so it felt like everyone was in their rooms getting ready to come down.  Tons of staff that didn't seem to know what to do to make themselves look busy- and a dude in a black suit just wandering around- looking over at your table constantly.  First and foremost- Know that if you order a beer from the tap, you're getting a HALF PINT (that's offside).  The dishes were good.  Nothing to complain about.  However, the cheapest main is $28 chicken...Let's get real here folks..Really?  1/2 a herbed chicken and boiled potatoes $28??  Same chicken you can get at a dozen other Greek resto's with boiled potato $12/$14?  This one is getting served on a wood plank though.    $6/pita..A. P-I-T-A?  Spend the extra $3 to get the dip with it to make it less insulting.   Listen the food is decent.  But there is very little value here whatsoever- this is NOT high-end.  Nothing mind blowing or original.  It's good Greek food at high-end steak house pricing with fresh seafood as the guise.    This concept simply can't last.  The 1/2 pint thing was the first low blow.  I also enjoyed your 2 scallops and orzo appetizer but $20? C'mon.     Dessert: the phylo filled with vanilla with a coffee sauce.  Phyllo.  Vanilla cream standard..the coffee sauce?  Tasted like they cooked down yesterday's coffee and added sugar.  Terrible. Price:  A lot more than it should be...  You have a nice space, beautiful actually.  I applaud you as I always respect the risk that a restaurant/business takes in presenting something new to the public.  My advice:    1- if someone orders a beer from the tap- THEY EXPECT A PINT don't insult them with a tall skinny glass that's only 1/2 the normal serving (is this even legal? http://bit.ly/YGPcdi  Measurement Canada's Fairness at The Pumps act (yes that's real)  2- Find something that is profitable and delivers value.  That very well could be the food you're serving- but your pricing is ridiculous and short sighted. Tacos, Gyros, Souvlaki, BBQ, whatever..This high-end Greek concept in this area is BS.  Really.  3- We're in 2014 not 1978- Cocktail lists consist of a lot more than Margaritas and Daiquiris.  You're high end.  You should know this...  If Captain John's and Mr. Greek's hooked up and had a Big Fat Wedding.  This would be it...  My recommendation:  Skip it."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. it's honestly worth going just for the dining experience. It's decorated in beautiful classy Greek decor with an amazing patio facing the beach.   My boyfriend and I went for lunch. He got a lamb burger and I got a pan friend calamari. To start we got a dip trio with pita. All was absolutely amazing. We also got coke, and it came in a glass bottle, really just topping off the whole feel of the restaurant. Everything was really authentically Greek.   It was a little pricy, but for a special night out, totally worth it."}
{"text":"Stunning restaurant! Service was outstanding! I read some of the previous reviews and can honestly say they've worked out the opening week jitters. The waiter we had was very attentive and helpful when ordering. While its not inexpensive, the quality in ingredients, preparation and delivery are very evident. It's great to see Toronto FINALLY catch up to New York, Miami, Chicago, and Athens in having a restaurant that is presenting Greek food in a way that's Greeks in Greece are used to."}
{"text":"By the way, what may seem cavernous and loud to some is just old world Greek to others, that's if you've ever set foot in a Greek restaurant outside the Danforth (or even Canada, for that matter). And if you've ever been to Montreal (the owners are from there), the restaurant culture is very vibrant and, for the most part, affordable. But it has its quirks since people aren't as demanding in Mtl - the customer is rarely right there. A prix fixe menu would be a draw; I still think not enough bang for buck (or too much buck for the bang)."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant!!! décor was first rate and very cheery.... and that big open patio will be dynamite when it gets warm again...   I didn't have any service issues at all... the server, hostess and manager that popped by were all very courteous and engaging...  the food wasn't what I expected,... in some ways better but in most ways a little disappointing... we tried a lot of dishes.... and I mean a lot... selection of dips, breads, salads, hot mezes and then the roast pork, lamb and octopus....  no point in giving you the play by play... Get the octopus and the lamb filled dumplings... forget the village salad, breads and roasts... the pork and lamb roasts were both very gristly and boney while the salad and the breads just arnt worth the money... what works out to be $8 for a pita? ehhhh...   okay if your out that way or if some suggests it but id rather head up to the Danforth or Volos downtown...."}
{"text":"Went back recently.  Things really picked up.   Lots of the growing pains have been worked out.   Worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant in an amazing location. Like being in the Greek islands. Innovative and delicious Greek dishes. Attentive service."}
{"text":"Worst food i ever ate in my life plus the staff were unfriendly and not helpful at all but the place looks nice if you are looking for a view ONLY"}
{"text":"Excellent food, service and atmosphere! It's pricy but worth it. Huge portions and excellent quality. I am surprised for lower reviews because we really liked it."}
{"text":"Things to watch out for are their wine list doesn't have enough options to buy by the glass and the wine is overpriced.  We requested extra pitas to finish our tzatziki to later find out that we were charged for them on the bill.  When I mentioned this to our server all she said was yes they gave us the pitas free with the dip but anything more than that we had to pay for.  If I had known that I would have taken home what I didn't eat.  A high priced restaurant like this can afford to comp some pitas.  One of the dishes we ordered never came and the server wasn't apologetic about it at all.  Also, the bathroom doors don't have signs on them for men and women.  You're supposed to notice that the decorations on the doors are two different colours and the men's is blue and the women's is white!  Overall though, the food here is very good!  I also enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first impression while walking in was WOW seafood . The host was not as pleasant but we moved forward anyway.  The patio seemed a bit crammed, there was a number of open tables yet they still sat people really uncomfortably near each other...  It also took them 15-20 mins to get any kinda water or wine to the table.   Ok so on to the food...   We ordered the Neptune platter and shrimp Saganaki .  My favourite item on the Neptune platter was the raw scallop with ikura. Wow that was delish!!! The lobster was cooked to perfection . Oysters were fresh . Clams were tasty. Muscles were good as well.  My only complaint was the prawns tasted like fish tank or frozen and not rinsed well before cooking . Both the shrimp on the platter and the saganaki tasted funky.   I will be back to dine in the evening to try to octopus however I will not be ordering anything kind of prawn or shrimp here for now .   They truly won my heart with the scallop ikura yum!"}
{"text":"Overpriced with small and average tasting portions.   Service was average too.  We paid $300 for 4 people and then went home hungry"}
{"text":"Love the location and view of the lake, the service was amazing and the appetizers were to die for, our fish was a tad over cooked but the home made fries made up for it!"}
{"text":"Rude rude rude staff, I'm sorry you had a bad day- you should have stayed home.  Realistically- the food is not that spectacular. With the sour attitude and location being more so a destination spot- I'll be happier dining somewhere else."}
{"text":"My two main disappointments were service and portions. Service: our server was curt, cold and unfriendly. He offered very little assistance while we were ordering (I have two small children and was trying to order a dish for me that we could share) and treated us as though we were an annoyance. I've rarely come across such poor service and working in the entertainment industry, I have the opportunity to eat out a fair amount.  Portions: this was the icing on the cake. I ordered a $22 plate of fish and chips and assumed that based on price and lack of direction from our server, that I could expect a large serving of fries and a decent sized piece of fish, as most other restos. What I actually received was an appetizer sized meal with an entrée price tag. The greens were cold and bland and the fish nuggets were barely enough for my three year old and certainly not enough for an adult.  It's a shame that a restaurant such as this is situated on the beach, where a number of families must wander in looking for a break from the sun and some nourishment.  What disappointment they too must feel. The snack shack outside proved more reasonable, welcoming and filling!"}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the patio part of Paralia, as apparently it is treated as completely separate from the restaurant itself.  The menu is a much smaller menu with very limited choices.  Been here twice after beach volleyball and the service is just awful.  Knowing that there is a volleyball league on the same day every week should mean that the restaurant should be better staffed, but it is not.    During the first visit, the server took so long to bring drinks and meals, she brought the wrong meals and forgot to charge us for stuff in the end.  We reminded her to add stuff to our receipt but again she forgot... so I guess it worked in our favour, but still horrible service.  The second time around we waited over an hour for a second round of drinks.  They ran out of almost all the food options for the patio menu.  The patio is really nice however, and the restaurant inside looks exquisite.  There is a completely different menu available inside."}
{"text":"Had lunch there with my best friend yesterday. It was amazing! Huge patio on the water. The location can't be any better. The food was outstanding a little expensive but outstanding. We had the village salad which was incredible I would have that everyday if I could. But it is definitely the location that would make me go back"}
{"text":"This place is so overrated. The moment you step in you feel like you have been transported to a greek island. The white and blue hues give a very authentic feel to the decor. We were seated promptly on a relatively uneventful sunday afternoon. The prices here do not justify the quality of the food. We ordered the octopus with balsamic reduction. It was very tender but the portion size was a joke for the $$ we paid. The cretan dumplings were delectable - it's one of their popular dishes. The lamb gyro was very dry and not very appetizing. The lamb was chewy (more than it should be) and we did not finish the plate. Our server was somewhat disconnected and despite asking him for dessert menu he ended up getting the bill. In hindsight it would have been better to just walk away at the time since the dessert we ordered was not memorable. It almost had the texture of a frozen dessert. I am not sure how these guys will stick around for too long. It's too pricey for the quality of food that is delivered and it's a huge space for a relatively quiet residential neighborhood. They need to revisit their pricing strategy and the quality of food if they want my business again."}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks ago and was so disappointed  with the breakfast. Worst omelet ever.  Maybe greeks  don't know how to make omelets. Made it bland and then put 2 pieces of tomato on it. Yuckkk!!! No other vegetables in it.  Not done till golden brown. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"I've been at this restaurant twice now and even know some of the items on the menu or are addictively good I always seem to get an item that is extremely disappointing. In my last visit I shared a bunch of appetizers that I know were going to be good and also a lamb gyro. the lamb gyro presentation looked phenomenal but the texture and the taste was extremely disappointing. At $19 for a gyro it should be really good. Unfortunately it didn't meet $7 par standards you find on the danforth. I continue to applaud the efforts this restaurant is trying to make and will probably continue to dine here regardless some bad plates."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful and I wish I could give it more stars. But I cant. The menu is overpriced and the staff EXTREMELY rude. We ordered take out and will never eat there again. My gf is a chef and were both really into what we eat, Ive never had service and food like Ive had here. They charge twice as much as the top restaurants in yorkville and their food is mediocre.   When I asked for a menu for take out I was told to look online after being handed one, which was totally arrogant and dismissive of the hostess.  They forgot to put cutlery in our take out bags and I had to walk back from the beach to get us forks and knives; and our bill was over $100. We didnt order just french fries. Neither of us wanted to eat our $30 fish with our hands.  When I asked for cutlery after going back in it was like I asked for free food; they make you feel like sh*t at this restaurant.   They shouldnt be this snobby and have only been on the beach for about 3 years; they should take lessons in dining etiquette from Torontos best restaurants if they want to be one.  This place sucks. 2 stars."}
{"text":"It's been a while since i've been to a restaurant that has been memorable. I went in expecting bad service. I got that. But it was made up for.  First off, the glaringly obvious, the owners have spent a lot of money on the ambience and interior. There are very few restaurants that do that in Toronto. You really do feel transported, and you almost expect this style of restaurant spending should be a restaurant for LA, Dubai, Capetown (places that spend a lot of attention to interiors). I'm glad to see this in Toronto. Don't get me wrong, i love the New York vibe that you find at the newer smaller restaurants, but we need a balance, and Trinity is the other side of that spectrum.    The food is exceptional. I can't complain about anything that i had there. I can only basque in the glory of a 100% satisfying meal. Every bite was perfectly prepared and really well thought out flavours. Fresh, delicate, attention to detail, even the side dish of potatoes blew me away. And i came here with Greek restauranteurs/hoteliers who agreed that flavours on some of the traditional dishes were very close to their mother's home cooking.   So you gain ambience and you gain high flavour. You miss service. If they hit that service mark, this would be a 5 star restaurant for me.  The service i experienced was disorganized/chaotic. I think the servers feel the pressure of their management. They feel like scared little mice scurrying around in fear. It's obvious that the owners/managers have a presence. After being ignored for 20 minutes, an owner actually ended up serving us for the entire evening, with his sincere apologies. That just shows me that they do care and register they have a service problem. I'm hoping that with time, trust will build up, the owners will be able to ease up a bit more and things will run better. But do you blame them? They've clearly spent a lot of money on the place? They'd probably be better off hiring some solid managers and letting things go for a bit.   In terms of price, we averaged roughly $70 at this place per head. Really, there are lots of restaurants in Toronto where you can do this and something or the other will be lacking.  If Trinity fixes it's service issues, it will be the best $70 you spend in Toronto."}
{"text":"We had made reservations for 9 p.m. Arrived on time and were told to wait another 10 minutes before we would be able to be seated. The restaurant wasn't even remotely full. Once they have finally sat us down and waited us, our food hadn't had come for over half an hour. Other costumers were receiving their orders quickly even when we had ordered earlier and the same dish. When our food came it was cold. We were barely asked how we were doing, or asked if we wanted to continue to order. We felt disrespected and ignored, we were so excited to come. This place has so much potential but it was not what we expected."}
{"text":"If you into fancy & expensive places, with big plates, small portions - you should visit. The decor is unique, amazing location and food is delish. BUT, I really hate places where they charge you for bread and butter. I ordered grilled sea bass - grilled to perfection, but my plate had only fish, no salad or rice on a side. You have to pay extra for everything....If you can afford, you will enjoy the place:)"}
{"text":"The devil is in the details and Trinity Taverna missed on several.   Decor - Nice try, almost great, but something is missing. The open concept proves to be too open, and you can hear everyone yelling at the kitchen staff. It doesn't feel cozy..  Prices -  It is very pricey for what it is. They try and sell you at every step, the menu was confusing, and I hate those Market Price tags on the menu (no one tells you the actual price, nor, as stated by another reviewer, there is no board with 'Market Prices'. What I find insulting is that you are paying for a nice dinner and it doesn't even include bread. We ordered Tzaziki (which comes with nothing to spread it in) and the pita (small serving).   Food - Salad - We ordered their version of the Greek Salad, nothing spectacular about it, however the cheese on top was fantastic.   We ordered 1 lb of Pork + a Red Snapper + Octopus + Zucchini  Pork was tasty, but 85% of our pork order was bones (really? if I am paying $38 for a pound of pork, I expect some meat)  Snapper was flavorful, but nothing to rave about, it wasn't filleted properly, and the ended up paying $68 (they assured me that it will come to $45-50 and apparently they cooked a heavier fish.   Octopus was AMAZING, very nice cooked, however the portion was tiny, one tentacle.  Zucchini was good.   For dessert we shared the Feta Cheesecake - very nice flavor, but I have to say it is very expensive at $12-14.  Service -  The service was horrible. Always pushing my table to order Wine (at least 5 times, they were drinking beer), there seems to be a lot of owners/supervisors on the floor and constant questions on how is everything.   In the end the operation is not smooth, a lot of 'owners' on the floor make you uncomfortable, and when I gave feedback (requested from one of them) about the pork bones, they just laughed and walked away.   I told the waiter when the bill came that the pork was a joke, (again, 85% bones) and he said he would talk to the maitre d', the guy comes and (with attitude) tells me \"so, what is it that you want?' At that point I lost it. I've been to amazing restaurants in Toronto where the service is impeccable, if you are charging these prices you better provide an amazing experience and food. In the end, they took half of my pork off the bill (crazy). I won't be back.  If I crave high end Greek, I will be back to Estiatorio Volos, amazing food and service always!"}
{"text":"When you get no competition, and a long term deal with the city, you can apparently do what you want.  I preferred the pub...but now you got a restaurant that most people can't afford.  I took the kids here, and ordered a ton of seafood. Service was slow, food was ok quality, but not worth the price.  In the end, we will make our own sandwiches instead next time we go to the Beaches."}
{"text":"Went for a family dinner during the weekend and was actually surprised as to how empty the interior was. The space is huge but still beautifully decorated, so it seemed like everyone was a bit scattered around. The ambiance reminded me of Santorini with the cobalt blue detailing and all white furnishings.  I ordered the lamb tartar appetizer for my main and was happy to see how large the portion actually really was. It was delicious but a bit more spicy than I would have liked it to be. My mom ordered the Chicken shawarma dinner plate with potatoes and tzatziki. The portion was HUGE. I tried some of her's and the potatoes were so incredible. My brother got the lamb shank with risotto and it was probably the best risotto i have ever had. And lastly, my father ordered the fish of the day which i did not try because it just seemed bland and not as exciting as all the other meals.   Oh we also ordered apps. We got the mussels and grilled calamari to start. The grilled calamari was good but standard and typical. The knock out for me was definitely the mussels with the garlic bread.  Overall, a really enjoyable, but yet pricey dinner."}
{"text":"I wouldnt rate this restaurant that best stars. To start off, it looked great at the beginning. then, I started eating. THE FOOD TASTED TERRIBLE! *Cough* sorry Afterwords, I don't have a sensitive stomach, so I had some gyro.  It was made with tzatziki, and I LOVE tzatziki. But this one was made with DILL. I could not belive how terrible it tasted until. I. Almost. Threw. Up. Yep. You heard me. THROW UP!!!"}
{"text":"Wow!   Trinity Taverna's decoration made me went Wow! The nice outdoor lounge area that overlooking Lake Ontario. The ocean blue and white colour theme. The huge looking bar. This is just like right out from a magazine.  Food though was a hit or miss and some is just too painfully expensive!   Miss: I wish that there is a \"white\" board that would state the prices of \"market\". Our fresh red snapper (2.5 lb) was not well prepared: flesh was mushy, cost $85 @$35 lb.   Tuna Tataki ($15) was definitely not worth it. A small little piece that I can eat that in one bite.. and it suppose to be a tapas? I need to share that? The texture was a little chewy too...where is the quail egg as stated in the menu? I was confused!  Suckling Pork ($32/lb) was dry and bland ... but the portion is decent for sharing with my dinner mate. I am glad I don't have to eat that whole thing myself.  Warm wild greens ($12) which I suggest just skip the green..  Hit:  Grilled Octopus ($29/lb) was really tasty. Love the meaty texture and it was not rubbery at all.   Lamb Sticks ($12) was nicely spiced and love the presentation. Just like 3 little tacos!  Spinach Cretan Dumplings ($8) has these pine nuts inside was delicious. Crispy and light phllyo wrappings. Love!  Dessert any one? I think I suggest you to skip dessert. For $12 a pop, those desserts were just too one dimensional and not worth the price. We shared:  Bougatsa which I enjoyed. I think I just like anything in phllyo cell??  Panna Cotta, Rizogallo (rice pudding), Yogourt Brûlée were all so so..  Service was attentive and cheerful.   I might be back for a drink and just lounge on the patio on a nice day... but I doubt I would be back for a full meal. A drink and some dumplings maybe? And daydreaming I am on a Greek island chilling away..."}
{"text":"This place is great for the ambiance. Decoration is pretty, view to the beaches is nice and the patio has lots of space.  For appetizers, we ordered Smoked Salmon with pita which was really good, Callamari, also delicious and the Oysters were amazing.   We were 5 and our waiter, who wasn't great, recommended 3 fishes to share, he said they were 1 pound each plus 2 sides.  The food took a while to come, it wasn't busy at all so we waited quite a bit. The fish was fresh, but not amazing in flavor as anticipated. The lobster had a rubbery texture and it was literally a piece with the size of my palm (not good for sharing) AND it was $48! WHAT!  We were disappointed as it wasn't enough food for all of us. Everything was super overpriced. I wouldn't go back for dinner."}
{"text":"I have not eaten here so I cannot rate their menu except it looks pretty pricey. I stopped in on a Friday afternoon to meet a friend for a drink, but I arrived first.  No staff was at the door to seat me, they were all whizzing around with food or drinks and the restaurant wasn't even that busy! Most of the tables were empty, the patio was a little busy, but there was plenty of seating outside. I stood there for a while trying to make eye contact with any staff... They totally ignored me.   I walked s lap around the restaurant and nobody acknowledged me at all. I finally flagged a waiter down to tell him I would seat myself. He walked me to the front door and called the host to escort me to a seat.  I specifically said \"patio please\" because that's the we reason we chose this place. He asked if I'm having lunch and I said \"just a drink\" and without skipping a beat, he sat me at the indoor bar. I told him I preferred the patio and he said the patio is only for lunch guests who order food.    After sitting alone at the bar staring at the back of the bartenders head for 10 minutes, he finally turned around to do another task, not to wait on me. I was tempted to walk out. I should have. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt and I stayed to order a martini- and texted my friend to find another place nearby because the service at Paralia is atrocious."}
{"text":"Looks great and a nice view and that's pretty much it.   Overpriced.  Attitude rich staff.  Mediocre food and way too lamb.   The even make a point if saying \"only the freshest baby lamb from Ontario\".   Ewww.  Can you bring that out in a stroller?  I had $22 fish and chips which should be $8.  I guess smiles are extra too since I didn't see any."}
