{"text":"Working all over downtown I get to sample a lot of the little coffee shops. This is one I hit up more often than others. The coffee is consistently above par (as far as downtown coffee shops go) and the service has always been great!
Service with a smile = priceless!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. I work in the building so eat it quite often. Isnt very appealing on the inside or outside, and I wouldnt meet my girlfriends here for coffee but for a quick bite it is great. The subs are very fresh, everything is grated/peeled/sliced by them. They have ham or bacon omlettes with everything you want on them served on a croissant, those are excellent. What I really like is the pizza, sooo good! He makes the dough and sauce from scratch. All the ingredients are fresh and the dough is fluffy but slightly crispy, it is amazing. He serves by the slice or whole and his prices are great for how his pizzas are handmade down to the crust. I would definately recommend giving it a try. If your heading there for lunch for a slice of pizza, head early though because they run out. They serve beer as well."}
{"text":"Cafe Sub is your \"run o the mill\" sub joint, with the usual order counter, your assortment of subs, donairs, pizzas etc.

But what I really liked about this place was the witty service, they state on their display menu that they have cheesecake, but they haven't had that for years, so your desert is limited to ice cream bars, some muffins, some plastic turnovers and \"man handled\" butter tarts.

The boy working there and his friend labelled things man handled, if they were dented, or falling apart. So by the end of the ordering session the man handled joke was next to exhausted.  However, aside from milking a joke too long with your customer, the donair sub was actually pretty delicious; on brown whole wheat bread and loaded with olives, jalapeno and a delicious sweet sauce at 5 something and loose change, we were pretty surprised.

This is on 4th avenue and it is a great quick stop if you are in the area and want something to eat that is healthy, the guy behind the counter is sweet and his friend thinks he is funny but the food is worth diving into. Stay away from the tarts though, they were man handled."}
