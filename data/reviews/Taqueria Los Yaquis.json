{"text":"A great late night stop for street tacos. Their tacos are simple, delicious, and only a buck each. It practically encourages binge eating, which is worth it. Their cheese quesadilla has 4 times the cheese you normally get and at 4 bucks is a steal. They have other food, including hot dogs and hamburgers for your more boring friends, though I fell in love with the tacos and cheese quesadilla and haven't looked back. It's become my late night go-to joint.
Be prepared for LONG lines lasting 20+ minutes just to order, then another 10-15 minute wait during peak time (after 2 am when the bars close). There are definitely some out there people who stop by too. If you've got issues with the LGBT segment of society, then you might want to skip it."}
{"text":"Pro: Food is great and cheap! 
Cons: Cash Only, No Parking, Always Busy! 
Would I go again: Yeh... 

I got the carne asada tacos ($1) and my friend super nachos ($8) ... plus a mini quesadilla for my baby niece ($2) Overall, the food was great! Good flavors and very affordable!! Buuuut, I almost ran over a line of people waiting to get tacos -_- there is no parking and it's a tight space."}
{"text":"Just got home from my 3rd time at this place. I ordered...

Quesadilla.. Cheese is not melted all the way and the bag had no hot sauce, nor was I offered any.

Asada burrito.. Meat was cooked, then stored in the fridge, then taken out and put in a tortilla. The drive home was less 3 minutes and no way does meat cool to fridge temp, wrapped in a tortilla, wrapped in foil, and bagged, this fast.

What I don't understand is why this took 10 minutes and what the hell were they doing with the grill? 

If hind sight was 20/20 I would have gone elsewhere.."}
{"text":"Best food! I want to eat there Thursday-Sunday! Love this place!!!!! The burrito is delicious! Park at Charlie's next store."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Sometimes the ladies can be a little rude. But whatever, don't matter, the Tacos and burritos are great."}
{"text":"Best tacos hands down! Really good steak tacos with great tasting sauce. I added jalapeños and grilled onions on the side. Delish! Definitely love the vibe."}
{"text":"It's places like this that continue enforce my opinion that Mexican food should be cheap. Their prices are more than reasonable. $1 tacos! I had the mega nachos and it had more cheese than chips to dip. When was the last time you had nachos and was left with extra cheese?!? Cheese/Chip ratio is amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious late night food. You cannot beat the price and fresh quality of the food. I found the tacos to be just a little bit spicy, and I typically can handle spicy food pretty well. This place was excellent and I will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Best carne asada tacos around!! And what makes them even better is the fact that they are only $1!!"}
{"text":"Great prices and delicious. If you are looking for a tasty taco or quesadilla this is the spot. There is usually a little bit of a wait but it is worth it, seating is outside on benches and they accept cash & card. It is easier to park at Charlies which is a night club next to it because there is limited parking in front."}
{"text":"The best carne asada quesadillas!!! Favorite hang out spot for Saturday night when in the central Phoenix area.  The food is the closest you'll get to the real Mexican food stand.  Love it and I'm not the only one."}
{"text":"Good,cheap,theres always a wait but its well worth it. Perfect late night spot. Simple choices of meats only pollo or carne and in keeping it simple they do tnese very well. Salsa is bomb as welll."}
{"text":"I hereby declare my love for Mini Quesadillas, and everything else they offer here. Great food"}
{"text":"My roommates and I heard whispers of Taqueria Los Yaquis through the streets of Phoenix. Little did we know the beauty that is held between the tortillas. Our first night visiting the taco truck (lovingly nicknamed gay tacos because of its proximity to the gay bar it is located behind) was an life changing experience, to say the least. As the clock struck midnight our four stomachs started to crave the spicy goodness of Mexican cuisine. My roommate, Jordan noted the fact that we had yet to try out the taco truck our beloved friends had told us glorious tales of. The other three of us grunted in agreement at the idea and headed out on our quest. 

We had a hard time finding parking since the bar is very popular most weekends, but we were finally able to locate a place to park. On the walk up to the truck we were met with a line of decent length, which both brought us dread, and anticipation. \"Cash only\" I noted, as I pointed to a sign ride near by. We all frantically reached for our wallets, worried that because of our college student lifestyle, would not be able to enjoy the food we so desperately craved. 

To our delight we had just enough cash for us to enjoy a perfect amount of tacos and mini quesadillas, since they were only $1 and $2 a piece. We made our way slowly to the front of the line. \"Should we get this to go?\" I asked the group, noticing the small amount of seating at the establishment. Again, the roommates grunted their agreement as we all took a second to take in the sights. 

The chefs could be seen through the window of the truck. We stared in awe at the amazing confidence of the individuals who did not look where their knife landed on the cutting board as they chopped up the meat for the meals they prepared. They looked as though they had channeled the ancient spirit of taco meet chopping, that we have all heard legends spoken of so often. The bar was hoppin', we noted, as we looked through the window that was meant to serve individuals inside the establishment. The look on the faces of the intoxicated individuals was that of pure joy as they received their delicious treasures. 

As we ordered our food from the very generally delightful woman at the table, we were filled with a sense of doubt. Maybe the food wasn't that great. I mean $8 for four tacos and two mini quesadillas? How good could it really be?  As we received our pink bags filled with the styrofoam containers that held our treasures, we noticed a table of people leaving. \"QUICK SNAG THAT TABLE!\" Screamed my roommate Aaron as we rushed to stake claim. 

We all opened our containers together and sank our teeth into the first bite. \"HOLY TITS!\" My third roommate (known to us as Jash) exclaimed. \"Good lord\" I remarked. \"Dddddaaaaammnnn\" replied my roommate Aaron. \"Mdksisha\" mumbled Jordan, as he did his best to convey the satisfaction the taste of the food brought to his mouth. We then proceeded to completely demolished the rest of the food. Noting the AMAZING flavor of the mini quesadillas and the almost overpowering but yet awe-inspiring spice of the harmless looking salsa. 

After that night, our lives were changed forever. We visited the taco truck many more times that year. At least 2-3 sometimes 4 times a month (since it was only open Thursday's-Sunday's). We continued to visit Taqueria Los Yaquis until the day Aaron graduated college and Jash moved on to other adventures. Jordan and I continue the tradition of randomly turning to each other at 11-12 at night and asking the other, \"So are we going to gay tacos or what?\"  And yes we still love the establishment. And will sing tales of its glories till the end of our days. So if you're asking yourself, \"Is it worth it? The place looks kinda sketch.\" Know this, the best taco truck in all of Arizona, and quite possibly the world, is located behind Charlies Bar on West Camelback. And it's name is Taqueria Los Yaquis."}
{"text":"For all the hype that it's getting I expected something a very good but  I give it a 2 on the tacos 3 on the quesadillas . Horchata was very good for $2 that's a great price the tacos were $1 I mean what do you expect . needed more flavor .line move kindof fast. would  I go there again probably not. I got there at 7:30 on Saturday and yes there was already a line"}
{"text":"Great street food. And despite what other reviewers say about the lack of beer, you can just go next door to Charlie's and grab some suds. They have an ordering window through the bar so you can get the best of both worlds!"}
{"text":"I've never been let down, from the tacos, to the drinks and the amazing super mega nachos! Seriously they are made for two and they are the best i've ever had. I grew up in a mexican house hold and these tacos hold up to it. I just wish they would give more lemon when asked but they dont"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for delectable late night tacos, etc. No other Phoenix Mexican food truck comes close!"}
{"text":"The spot to get your taco fix. Only open on Thursdays till Sundays. The best spot for $1.00 tacos and $2.00 mini quesadillas. Gets crowded even after late night. Get some free peppers and grilled onions upon requests."}
{"text":"Best place ever... Super Mega Nachos are life changing, burritos are worth their weight in gold. Friendly service, quality food... by far the best value too. Will not leave hungry or disappointed."}
{"text":"Culinary Graduate - Norwegian Cruise line EmployeeI would recommend chicken tacos, line is a little long, but tacos for a dollar that are that good are waiting for!"}
{"text":"I think this is the best taco truck in Phoenix. Order the mini quesadillas. Yum. And, if you are a low carb eater order the carne asada/chicken combo plate with no tortillas. Super yum. Sometimes late at night the line is long but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Soooooo good!! The wait was a little long but well worth it!! 2 tacos and a mini quesadillas for under 5 bucks... I wish they would increase their hours though..."}
{"text":"Best street tacos eveeerrrrr!! I love their mini quesadillas! Be prepared to wait to wait though, no matter what time I've gone I've always had to wait. Especially, if you go after midnight. But it's so worth it! If you are a taco lover, try it. But also make sure to try the asada mini quesadilla."}
{"text":"These tacos may not win the award for best tacos at a taco festival but there's no contest, they are authentically the best!!! It's also clean and a great price. The lines don't lie."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Arizona and only for a buck. You can't beat that price. The nachos are amazing the burrito are made any way you like."}
{"text":"PHOENIX HIDDEN GEM!!!! Cant beat the $1 tacos and the late night hours! I'm so glad so many of my friends told me to go!

Park at Charlie's."}
{"text":"Oh wow I am super surprised this place only have a few reviews. This place is always packed with a line from it being so popular. CHARLIE\"S TACO STAND!!

These are the BEST tacos I have had since I moved to Phoenix. I dont know how to explain how great they are. They meat is finely chopped up on top of a palm tree trunk which I am not sure if it give it a flavor to the meat but I think it does. The menu is simple only chicken and carne asada tacos for $1 (super cheap) and the have burritos and a few other items but the tacos I believe are the best!!!"}
{"text":"$1 tacos. Only complaint is they only have 2 meats: carne asada and pollo. Got one of each and also got the carne asada quesadilla. The quesadilla was mean! Think I liked it more than than the cheap filling tasty tacos. Line can get long but I was lucky and only wait about 15-20m. The sauce can be spicy for some, as I watched another customer have a really hard time handling it but it was perfect for me! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place was packed! But I could definitely see the appeal, the meat seemed to need more condiment in my opinion but these tacos are cheap and are probably the closest thing to what I have seen compared to authentic Mexican street tacos. With about $6 you can definitely eat enough to feel comfortable afterwards. I do recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this little taqueria. The prices are so cheap that it doesn't really matter that the meat quality is a bit on the low end. I've never waited more than 45 minutes even on the busiest nights.. I do wish they made their own horchata, though, instead of using what I believe to be a powder mix.."}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best street tacos i have had. Its conveniently located and is easy to get to. They always have so many people here. That must speak for itself because everyone loves the menu. Its cash only and all sales are as seen. No tax!! Its great. Come on down and get some. They are open until 4 Saturday and Friday. Its great for the night owls."}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing and the super mega nachos are wow enough said.The food is really filling and great portions.The atmosphere is fun."}
{"text":"Hands down the best freakin tacos, quesadilla, burrito, nacho EVER! Very good good at dirt cheap prices. Tacos ($1), quesadilla ($7), burrito ($5) and nachos ($7). My husband and I are huge fan of this little taco truck. The line is ridiculous at times but for good reasons. I've waited over an hour in line before. YES, I said over an hour wait just to order. Some people don't understAnd why I do it but honestly it's that good. Come try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed. P.S. They occasionally do cash only so bring your cash people."}
{"text":"I don't really eat tacos, but when I do, it better be from Taqueria Los Yaquis! 

THIS. This place is the reason why I don't wake up hungry and broke come sunrise nyahahaha. OMMMNOMNOMNOM!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. First time. Went over at 8:30. It was half hour wait but well worth it. Had the steak nachos and chicken tacos. $9.00. The steak is so good. Can't compare to crappy Fili Bs. The corn tortillas are so tasty and authentic. The salsa is yummy. All the ingredients were so fresh and flavorful. Will definitely go again. Kinda wish they were opened all week but why would they? You know it's good when you only have to make an appearance three times a week!"}
{"text":"I should give this place one star only to deter others from coming here, but I cant. The place is awesome. Super cheap, super tasty, super BUSY too. The mini quesadillas are the best thing on the menu. Its a must try! The tacos are the best dollar tacos around. Here's a little hint for you. Don't try to park on the street. Park in Charlie's parking lot and walk around or just go inside Charlie's(Its a gay bar, don't be scared) and order from the window inside Charlie's back patio. It's WAY faster and you can get a beer from the bar."}
{"text":"So sad.  Where did they go? Drove by around Christmas time and they were gone, just drove by again and the trailer is still not there. Did you move? Miss you already!"}
{"text":"I love Los Yaquis!! Their carne asada tacos are simply the best in Phoenix!! They are always packed!! The tacos are super cheap too!! They are open only from Thursday-Sunday!"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos at $1.00 a pop. Yes!!! Steak, cabbage, hot sauce, sour cream if you ask for it. Best street tacos around. 

The line is (usually) long but it's so worth it. On any given weekend night you will find bar goers, families, people just getting off work, all lined up for some taco truck amazing-ness. The burritos are huge, the nachos look amazing, the quesadillas are always a good stand by, but the tacos....oh the tacos. 

Take my advice...don't be put off by the line but be prepared to wait. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Great service, great product and great price! Best $1 tacos, Super Nachos is my fav and kids love the horchatas."}
{"text":"Best $1 you can spend! Everything is made fresh and tastes amazing! You can easily order 4-6 tacos and devour them yourself! Tacos are $1 and mini quesadillas are $2. Both are topped with cabbage, hot salsa, and guac. Don't forget to ask for the grilled onions and jalapeños."}
{"text":"Overrated, and the 2 hour wait in line totally not worth it!  We need more late night taco stands!"}
{"text":"Been going here every Friday night for the past few years to grab some food and leave. Best street tacos and carne Adams burritos that I've had in the Phoenix area. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Place is really good! Had it for the first time this weekend & it was nothing but positive. Though it does get packed, they do get your food out very quickly. Another plus is how cheap it is. I really enjoy $1 tacos!"}
{"text":"The food here is great, specifically when you it there. The few times I've had it to-go, it's been a little less appetizing because it gets soggy.

I mainly go for the tacos and mini quesadilla which are both excellent. There isn't much of a variety & the chicken isn't great, but the carne asada is bomb. The burritos are decent as well! 

My complaints would be the efficiency at which they operate. They have one person taking orders for the line outside and also for the line inside the neighboring connected bar. They are also stingy with giving out sauce. I would prefer they put my sauce on the side especially for the quesadillas so that they don't get drenched & soggy so quickly. 

I'd recommend this place if you have a good amount of time to wait & don't mind eating outside at picnic tables!"}
{"text":"The best!!!this place never disapoints. Whenever I go, i fell in love all over again. Even when there is a long, long line, its on.... One line i never mind being part of! Gracias Yaquis for being amazing!"}
{"text":"This is the best place in Phoenix for street tacos and burritos. The food is always amazing and delicious. The meat tastes great and they cook it until it's crispy but not too crispy, just long enough so that the flavors and juices flow together in harmony. The street tacos are a dollar. Yes, just $1. The burritos are $5. There is an average length to longish line whenever I've visited. The staff is on it, they try to serve quickly and they are friendly. They serve 2 Windows. One for inside the Charlie's Bar and the other is outside the bar. They are open late so it's just the right fix for a late night snack. Just go already, I don't know what you're waiting for. Otherwise you are really missing out on some amazing food."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I've ever had. I just wish they carried pico de gallo or red sauce."}
{"text":"This place has really good tacos and the mini quesadillas are great too. Food is cheap but the only downside is the line, wow it can be a little crazy."}
{"text":"Absolutely obsessed with this place. Currently here as I type and this is my 3rd weekend in a row coming to this spot. Obsessed with the mini quesadillas. All for a sweet price too  I definitely recommend this as a place if you're out after midnight and want a late night snack. Thanks for making my weekends something to look forward to!"}
{"text":"Okay this place is connected to a Homosexual bar. It's very entertaining actually because they tried hitting on me. It's a very busy place we were here Thursday night around 12am and the line was to the street and we got our food ate and the line never stopped. The weekend I heard is even worse. Everyone loud, drunk, and just hungry for some good tacos. I call them gay tacos because everyone's happy and eating tacos or whatever else they want to order. The line wasn't really that long if you have some company with you to talk. The prices are amazing 1 taco is 1$ so I got ten with some horchata which was amazing! I paid about 13$ but I was hungry and I can eat so I can't complain on that. This play is just an amazing place to go if you're drunk or have a couple of friends and want some Gay tacos! Love it I will be back 100%!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Phoenix from NYC everyone told me that the Mexican food in AZ was going to be amazing. I suppose I went to all of the wrong places because I never found better Mexican food there then what I had experienced else where (compare \"Tortilleria Mexicana Los Hermanos\" in Brooklyn). Taqueria Los Yaquis was the exception. The food was excellent. Their tortillas were always hot, had a fresh flavor and tasted amazing. Their carne was salty, flavored well and well portioned. Their sauces are hot and very tasty! The line was cray sometimes but the food is worth it and that's why we waited time and time again. The pricing is just right and it's the ultimate in late night munchies. Sooooo gooood."}
{"text":"This is the best taco truck in Arizona!  The lines are always long but it's totally worth the wait.  I'm long overdue for a visit and can't wait to take my husband.  My mouth  is literally watering as I'm writing this review:-)"}
{"text":"Amazing street tacos.  Taco truck feel with outside seating and relaxed atmosphere.  Will definitely be back for late night eats.  Open until 4am!  Only thing missing on the menu is beer."}
{"text":"Sketched me out at first until I realized what it was next to and why everyone in line was dancing, but MOST AMAZING $1 TACOS I HAVE EVER TASTED. Especially the carne asada. Go. The owners deserve your money!!"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever! Love this place, and the dollar per taco makes it even better. Staff is friendly, but always carry cash just in case their credit card machine isn't working."}
{"text":"I was completely wrong, this place is still alive and kicking. Come one come all and enjoy. And disregard my previous statement."}
{"text":"I'm a Los Angelenos that has finally found a spot to cater to my mexican street food cravings from back home. I miss my hometown so this will do."}
{"text":"Simply AMAZING!  Prices are fantastic and the food is spectacular.  I've been coming here since they first started with a six foot table and a portable gas range.  I particularly love the quesadilla with Carne, the chicken is good as well.  The hot sauce can be a bit spicy so be prepared."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best tacos around... The meat was pretty dry, the sauce isn't spicy/tasty at all, and their horchata had wayyy too much cinnamon in it. I'm just giving it two stars because the tacos were only $1 & the wait wasn't long. But I don't think I would come back unless I try something else besides the tacos :/ 
If you're getting lit inside of the bar it's connected to though, I would understand why they'd taste good :-) lmao"}
{"text":"Wasn't blown away as suggested by some reviews, but pretty good tacos for the cheap price.  But they are not the best I've ever had and the service is very slow. I didn't think the line was too long and was surprised to find myself still in line 15 minutes later. Disappointed to see only carne asada or chicken choices. The tacos were a great size for a late night snack. I found the mini quesadillas to be too salty, although it did have a nice crisp.  The salsa roja had a nice spicy kick.  The horchata was too creamy and sweet. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. But if I were in the area and had the nighttime munchies, it'd be better than a 24 hr fast food joint. Just be ok with waiting up to 45 minutes for some tacos."}
{"text":"Seriously hands down the best tacos yet!!! The tacos here is so good and very affordable. Only tried the Asada Tacos so I can only speak for it.
The tacos is so good! Guacamole is so creamy and the meat is very well marinated. It's pretty small so I usually get like 4-6 tacos depending on how hungry you are. I heard the burritos is also very good. Came here two times only and I already love it here. Will definitely come again. As for service, it wasn't anything special they were polite and just take orders. The wait is pretty long. Usually 10-15 minutes for your order."}
{"text":"The salsa was too strong, did not settle well with me. The tacos are like .50 cent tacos not 1.00. They gave me corn tortilla and didn't even offer to give me flour. I was there a year ago and everything was good but now they seem to be cutting some corners. Not recommended you much better making your own tacos."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. This is by far the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Firstly, the horchata is made from a mix. As a result of this, it is chalky. Secondly, the nachos have that fake nacho cheese and round yellow chips, not anything remotely authentic or Mexican. The only okay thing was the meat. This was more like a cheap meal you would get at a theater; completely overpriced and shitty. I can see why it has late hours; only drunk people would classify this as a good meal. Anyone who has been to a real, authentic Mexican restaurant should proceed with caution."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever. I drive all the way here because the tacos are just great and cheap too! When I come, I do expect to wait but it is worth it. They are only $1 a piece. The burritos are amazing too! For those who don't like to wait, then this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"my favorite place to eat. I've been coming here for years, and their carne asada mini quesadillas are my absolute go-to, and only $2 each."}
{"text":"Best carne asada tacos in AZ. Ask for the carne asade mini quesadillas, They are not on the menu, but really really  good."}
{"text":"good food for cheap. i recommend the mini quesadillas. The tacos are bomb too though"}
{"text":"WORTH THE WAIT.

I know you've probably stumbled upon yelp because people keep talking about this talking place but every time you attempt to come, there is a dizzying line of people already waiting.

Well you're reading the right review because I'm here to tell you, I am one of the most impatient people in the world but for these tacos, I will gladly wait. (which is exactly what I did last night for an hour, so worth it)

First off, they're dollar tacos. I repeat $1 DOLLAR TACOS. 

Here are some things to remember when waiting here:

-The beef tacos are slightly better than the chicken, but just order both because they're a dollar.
-You get onions and jalapenos FOR FREE but you have to let the lady you're ordering from know that you want them.
- Get extra salsa if you're a spice fan like I am. Extra lime too!
-You can't pay with card unless you spend at least 10 dollars (this rule may have changed)
-Just buy 10 tacos, just do it. I promise you will eat all of them.
-The taco truck is located right outside a gay bar which is why they are nicknamed \"gay tacos\". 
-You will meet some interesting characters in this neck of town. Embrace it.
-The horchata is good! No artificial flavoring."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Mexico so I can truly say this place brings the best flavor when it comes to tacos and salsa. Delicious."}
{"text":"For as many times as I've been here, I could have written 20 of these reviews. 

After having just about everything from the menu, I usually have the burrito. The burrito is more substantial than 5 tacos for same price, order it with a side of jalapeños and some extra salsa. The nachos are also good, I'll get those when not feeling the burrito, and again always with extra jalapeños. This spot is a real Phoenix staple in the world of tacos.

Sometimes, when you get here and there is a 45 minute long wait just to order, consider going inside the club, to order, they have a window inside Charlie's as well as walk up outside the club.

Come here, eat tacos (or burritos) and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best street tacos and quesadillas  that are a bargain too!  The protein may not be of the highest caliber but the prep and overall experience lead to repeated visits.  The super mega nachos are a snack that can satisfy nearly any late night craving and are perfect for sharing!  I've introduced many friends to this place, all whom rave about it as well.  Simple outdoor seating right outside Charlie's Bar.  I've been fortunate and haven't had to stand in line too long...30 minutes max, just avoid the late night post club rush."}
{"text":"Plain and simple you can never go wrong at this place. Tacos are only $1.00 and worth every bite. Rather than spending tons of money at a subpar taco place spend $10.00 and get the best street tacos of your life."}
{"text":"Great amount of food for the money but the flavor wasn't there for me. Everything came across as kinda spicy but then left a bland taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I'm reluctant to give away this treasured hide-away because it's one of my secret (that's obviously not a secret) places. The tacos are amazing!!! The is my official spot for years now. My friend Karen introduced me to this food truck (I usually don't do roach coaches...LOL) which is adjunct to Charlie's club on Camelback and 7th Ave. You'll meet a colorful cross selection of people from all over the valley. Some time the other customers are intoxicated beyond belief and act as such but, that doesn't take away from the good, fresh, flavorful food. There is not one thing that is bad on the menu and the prices are reasonable. Depending on how veracious your appetite, I'd start with 3 carne asada + 3 chicken tacos, fully dressed (double that is you can eat a lot).  The lines are long especially after 11pm and you may wait up to 10 minutes for your food but, it's well worth it. The music from Charlie's pipes through and is entertaining. My biggest complaint is the parking. They have only a few spots right there, or you have to park in Charlie's overly crowded parking lot because the city has put up new signs not allowing you to park in the nice sized adjacent lot (but they do all the time...thx Phoenix PD). Go check it out because they are there Thurs-Sun until 4am!"}
{"text":"Just wanted to grab something quick and saw this place right down the street. 

I got 6 asada tacos. They were pretty good. You can get as much of other toppings you want.

I also got a side order of rice. Rice was pretty good as well. 

6 tacos, side of rice and a dr. Pepper $12. Not too bad for a good lunch that fills you up.

Would definitely come back when in town."}
{"text":"Best after hours choice in Phoenix! Really good authentic cheap Mexican food. Good horchata! Good salsa! Good food! The long lines at 2am are definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Always outstanding good quality Mexican food, don't miss this food truck, you can get off the lite rail at 7th Ave and walk across the street. South side of Camelback, if you like Mexican food in LA please go there and leave us alone.   LA Mexican really sucks compared to this."}
{"text":"Haha Eat Right billboard above/behind food truck: eating right also includes frame of thought when eating. Trust me my tastebuds is singing to my brain. \"Buy more lol.\"

One of the many things I've learned:  ask the locals where they like to eat; or if looking for particular type of ethnic food, ask that particular ethnicity if you are able to. They usually will have the best recommendations.  I should know being half Korean & having a full Korean mom who makes amazing food plus. I have a tendency to be a little pickier when it comes to Korean food. 

Now this is true when I was introduced to this little gem!!!  Thank you for this tip & sharing your large To Go order with me haha!!  I will definitely go out of my way to go back if I need a taco/quesadilla fix. And love the fact it wasn't greasy & was packed full of deliciousness. Still amazed over the quality, quantity & incredible price.  No wonder it's very popular!  Just be prepared to wait sometimes (20-30min in line) but well worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, slow service. Plan on waiting for a while to get your food, but this taco truck has some of the best tacos in the valley. Carne asada Or pollo, and they have quesadillas, nachos as well: this is outside of Charley's night club near 7 ave and Camelback"}
{"text":"The other night was wonderful! I met her in the city after cocktails with friends. I was blindsided...I had no idea she would just randomly come into my life like that, but it happened. She's on the petite side, and puts herself together a little nicer than most girls around that part of town. The moment we connected though, I knew she was far from hollow. In fact, she was one of the most down-to-earth, simple, yet complex, ladies I've met in a long time who is filled to the brim with good things, and she's not the type of lady just looking for your money. When we kissed, time stopped, and in that moment I knew true bliss...and needed a napkin.

She's a mini quesadilla, and for $2, she's more than worth venturing to Yaquis, one of Phoenix's legit late-night grub spots, for. I always used to get the tacos, but this time I went with a gut feeling, and it paid off! No longer will I be held down by my self-bestowed shackles! No longer will I preach that the tacos are king, and that they're the only food that matters at Yaquis! For the sky opened up, and a divine thing occurred that beautiful night...I know now what I must do. I must shout it from the mountaintop! THE! MINI! QUESADILLAS! ARE! DELICIOUS!

So go already."}
{"text":"Tacos are ok there tortillas Are small and a  little crunchy...better then other Mexican fast food joints around here... Still not the same as street tacos in Mexico.. Hamburger is not so great rather get a Mcdouble..."}
{"text":"OMG, like what my friend said, \"it's bomb.com!\" At first, I wasn't convinced but  when I saw the huge line of people, I knew this place would be authentic. 

We ended up ordering way too much, but we were amazed how these small tacos tasted fantastic. It's definitely different from the LA tacos I usually get, they have minced cabbage instead of regular cilantro and onions. The freshness and quality of the meat was great, but it's the salsa that really stands out. 

Whenever I'm in AZ, I'll have to stop by again!"}
{"text":"You really can't get a better deal than $1 tacos. After nearly risking your life parking off the street just wait in line for 15 minutes to place your order. I have to admit that the hype lured me in... Anything that takes 15 minutes just to order better be worth it. 

It really is. Yum!.. I personally think it's the corn tortillas which they heat to perfection. I mean, who wants a soggy taco? Very zesty salsa, thanks for the extra limes, and the asado and pollo both are succulent. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Perfect Perfect
Tacos for $1  
Its worth the wait so be prepared

Remember its cash only and very little parking

Through all the chaos and work you will be satifisfied with eating at this lovely hidden Gem"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican tacos (I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur) ... and you can't beat the prices.  Right outside of Charlies Night Club, off the light rail with easy access. Yum, yum, yummy."}
{"text":"I've tried these tacos on several occasions, both, sober and after 2AM drunken stupors... they are (wait for it) THE BEST! If you don't believe me, try 'em yourself. Then hit me up on Yelp! and thank me for tastebud party that just happened in your mouth. You're welcome in advance. :)"}
{"text":"I have banned myself from going to gay tacos. Simply put, it's the best cheap, tasty meal you will find open uber late. It is a little addictive... I also appreciate that they are open until like 2 or 3 AM, it's unheard of in Phoenix sadly. 

Note for those who are new or don't know how to properly order from a taco stand/food truck: 

Always order a side of cebolla asada and jalapeños toreados. It definitely amplifies your meal with a tasty kick of heat and texture. You won't regret it.

Also their carne asada quesadillas are ridiculous for what you pay. It's a damn steal for the price."}
{"text":"Best taco place ever. Tacos are great and cheap and their horchata is the best!!! I honestly highly recommend it! Tacos are a bit small but perfect for $1. Also salsa is spicy I like to order it on the side! Cheese crepes are very yummy. Really good Mexican tacos"}
{"text":"Fantastic street tacos. Probably in my top 5 for Phoenix now. Despite what Yelp says, the place is cash only. But with tacos being just $1, you don't have to bring much."}
{"text":"This is one of the other taco place that hits me right at home. I mostly come here during the night time because its really one of the only taco places open late (please do not compare to Filibertos!!). Menu is pretty simple chicken or carne asada, awesome prices too! Also I love where they cook and cut the meat, it's like a food cart on steroids...HUGE and impressive. Out late and around the area don't miss out on this place."}
{"text":"Well it took some time. My gf now hates this place. I would come with her because she didn't want to eat alone. I'm not a fan of these tacos.  They are a dollar for a reason.  They are small, meat sucks, no cilantro or onions which I rather have over cabbage or whatever it is. Last time we went my gf didn't finish her tacos. The \"carne asada\" look more like ground beef. The meat was really shredded. The meat lacks flavor, always has. I don't get how people rate this 5 stars but there are better taco places. This one is mediocre at best. 

I wish they can get rid of the bums. Yes I get it they are homeless but trust me I have bought them tacos since they ask for food and not $. 3 of them approach me the other night. I told the lady if they can please tell them to go away. One of them reeked alcohol and the others smoke near by. I'm never coming here again"}
{"text":"I think I might be spoiled just having moved back from L.A.  I thought these tacos were only okay.  I think they needed just a little more seasoning.  I was lucky, I hear there is normally a longer wait.  I had ordered the al pastor tacos and the quesadillas with beef.  Can't say I really want to go back."}
{"text":"BEST real street Mexican tacos. I wish they were open through the week  but we go every weekend!!! Not a single complaint on this place besides the lines, but that's to be expected with bomb ass tacos."}
{"text":"Huge fan of authentic tacos and this place, without a doubt in my mind , is the best! I normally like tacos better than burritos and I was left guessing which one I like better there. Not a single complaint."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a late night bite. I always get the chicken and steak tacos with a quesadilla. On point every time. The red sauce is fire too.  Also try their roasted peppers."}
{"text":"BEST freaking tacos ever! Stop wasting your time trying other taco places! This is THE place to go if you want real, authentic mexican tacos!"}
{"text":"the best tacos and quesadillas ever created !!!!!!
the line is always so long but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"It took me a long time to try this place.  I do have to admit, I am not a big fan of food trucks.  In the back of my mind I wonder how sanitary they are.  Do they have adequate hand washing facilities?  One evening sometime ago I ignored my pre conceived ideas and gave them a shot.  The menu is small; tacos, nachos, burritos and I think maybe hotdogs and hamburgers.  What really caught my eye was the carne asada taco. Maybe one of the best tacos I have tasted and only one dollar each.  Be warned these are on the spicy hot side and I don't usually like spicy hot.  The flavor really is terrific and I quickly forget that my mouth is on fire."}
{"text":"THE ONLY PLACE IN PHOENIX FOR ABSOLUTELY AUTHENTIC AND DELICIOUS TACOS!!!!  Its not hype, this place is the real deal!  If you are Hispanic and missed good Mexican food, esp Carne Asada ... Go here! It's unreal.  Oh bring your gun just in case someone tries to rob you.  I already shot 2 people in the 10 times I have been there... Don't worry, I shot them in the knees and disarmed them."}
{"text":"This place is great. Real Mexican tacos. The down side is there hours.... they are open only in the afternoons. Other than that worth the wait and the drive!"}
{"text":"If I could sit on an air conditioned couch with a beer and immediately enjoy my nachos, this place would be five stars but, alas, I have to wait to get home... therefore, only four. But four grateful, guilty pleasure, love-filled stars!

$7 for a heaping, i-am-somewhat-ashamed-for-nearly-finishing-them-myslef-sized serving of SUPER nachos. Movie theater style tortilla chips, doused in (what I like to call) \"fake\" cheese, carne asada, jalapenos, salsa, guacamole and sour cream... consuming them is an entirely unhealthy act of gluttony -- one in which we should all spoil ourselves and indulge on occasion!

They're only open Thursday - Sunday and mostly with late night hours: 
Thu: 9:00 pm - 3:00 am 
Fri - Sat: 9:00 pm - 4:30 am 
Sun: 4:00 pm - 3:00 am"}
{"text":"I agree with all the great reviews here
These are, in my opinion, some of the best street food/food truck meals in Phoenix. The carne asada tacos are legitimately scrumptious. Everything on the menu is yummy but my top three are the tacos, burritos, and the super mega nachos! There is always a line for food whether you are inside of Charlie's or outside on the eating area. They take cash and credit. 

Check it out"}
{"text":"Not sure about this place, it appears to be closed. I went here at 12:40pm and not open. This is a food truck at a physical address."}
{"text":"Best freaking Tacos and salsa from the Midwest back to AZ hands down. My fav are the chicken Tacos. The salsa, OMG, I can drink there salsa red and green!!!! Hallelujah! Yummy tacos and friendly customer service it's best!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good asada tacos which is not easy to find in Phoenix. Both quesadillas are also very good, the mini and the full-size. It's only a four star because of the limited menu choices. The pricing is about as cheap as your going to find.

This place delivers excellent flavor and a good price point. The service is quick and helpful. The employees make you feel welcome and at home even though it's outdoors. 

If you are craving Mexico style street tacos this is about as close as you're going to get in the Phoenix area. If anybody knows a better taco stand please let me know."}
{"text":"I come here for years I love eating after a long night out with my friends. This place has the best Carne Asada everything ever!!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Ricky Martin - Livin La Vida Loca)

I'm into carne tacos hot sauce and horchatas
I taste a quesadillas that place's gonna make me smile
I'm into new sensations new foods in the Phoenix streets
I've got a new addiction for every day and night

It'll make you take our clothes off and go dancing in the club
It'll make you live that crazy life but it'll take away your hunger pain
like a bullet to your brain. Come On!

Upside, inside out I'm hitting up a Taqueria
I'll eat and drink some down, hitting up a Taqueria
It's lines are crazy long and it's sauce is color Roja
I will wait you it out hitting up a Taqueria....come on!
Hitting up a Taqueria, come on!
I'm hitting up a Taqueria.


Probably one of the best taco shops I've had in a long time especially in Phoenix.  

Taqueria is a taco food truck parked right outside of a night club.  Overall, it's pretty darn tacky in my point of view, but damn does it work!  Lines here can get really crazy and long plus when it's summer time; it's just darn redonkulous!  

Needless to say, it was worth it!  For only $1 a pop these tacos were amazingly good!  I ordered 5 Carne tacos which came with beef, onions, cilantro, and salsa.  Basic to the point, but that's how it should be!  Sprinkle some lime atop and let your palates sing.  I didn't even use the salsa that came along with it since I thought it was pretty tasty without it.  The corn tortillas was soft and warm wrapping the tender beef, while the onions provide a hint of crunch.  The cilantro was aromatic while the lime and salsa ended your final bite with a sour and spicy punch!  

In the end, Taqueria is not located in the best spot in town, but it's definitely worth a visit at least once regardless. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the tacos here everything else I have tried pales in comparison. I haven't been in a while but I plan to correct that asap! Yes the lines are long but the people working there are nice and the food is worth it!! Win!!"}
{"text":"Food: These both got a little messy to eat so ask for extra napkins!

- Taco asada - beef, cabbage, guacamole, salsa, and hot sauce over a mini flour tortilla ($1). Tasty and dirt cheap! 4/5

- Quesadilla Pollo - chicken and cheese with cabbage, guacamole, salsa and hot sauce sandwiched between 2 mini flour tortillas ($2). Also, tasty and cheap! 4/5

Service: Fast and friendly. This food truck spot opens at 7:30, we got here at 7:38 and all the table were taken. We had to wait for people to leave so we can quickly grab their table. I'll definitely come back. A tasty meal for $4, I also ordered bottled water ($1). 3/5"}
{"text":"Yeah, the lines are long, but that's a sign that the food must be worth it, right?

So yeah, you have to wait awhile for some delicious / cheap tacos (or whatever item you decide to go with). The $1 tacos are still just as fantastic as I remember them being, and the $2 quesadillas are right up there with them. 

The pico seems a little spicier than before, but still good. I noticed that it's now \"cash only\", which is pretty inconvenient, and hopefully that's just a temporary thing. 

If you're in or near the area, this place is a must. The food is better than authentic."}
{"text":"Currently on the phone with Yelp! This place deserves 5 stars! These are the best tacos in Phoenix!
The older gentleman manning the grill aka \"El Don\" is truly the master and backbone of this operation. He has so much flare and charisma when seasoning that tender juicy steak and chicken!"}
{"text":"While I prefer several other taco spots in Phoenix, Taqueria Los Yaquis deserves a special gratitude for their unbelievably cheap prices. When you pay $1 for an asada/beef or pollo/chicken taco, $2 for a mini quesadilla, and $2 for an horchata, it is hard to leave disappointed (Cash only)"}
{"text":"Went there based on yelp reviews. Totally dissapointed!!  Only two choices of meat, asada and chicken.  Both type of tacos are bland and not good. Not sure what all the crowd and fuss about.  I do not recommend it all."}
{"text":"How on EARTH have I not reviewed this place!? Why? I'll tell you why. Because I stopped approaching this place with any airs of evaluation long long before I started consistently writing reviews on Yelp.

This place has the perfect food. It's delicious, unpretentious and super cheap. You can tell it's made by people that never went on a quest to make the world's most delicious tacos - it just happened because of the magic of family recipes. Like, it's street food, so if that's not your thing don't go. But, if what you want is to experience some delicious tacos and a slice of City life that is as endearing as it is confusing, go here and hang out any time between 11 p.m. and 4 a.m. If you go here and walk away unhappy, that's your problem.

Only heads up is that their hours are kind of wonky because they serve the late night crowd."}
{"text":"This was a food truck set up in the lot of the bar (Charlie's). They were $1 and so tasty. The were the best taco's I have ever had!!!"}
{"text":"Best. Tacos. Ever. They are soooo reasonably priced, friendly and amazing at what they do. Bring cash, it's cash only, and line may seem long, BUT IT'S WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!! The long wait sucks but it is worth it for some of the best and cheapest tacos in the valley."}
{"text":"Ummmm. I have been here twice since moving close by. This place was hyped up to me as the BEST TACOS! but BEST does not mean authentic. No Bueno for vegetarians, but they do have some insanely tastey cheese sauce on their nachos..."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times now, and each time it's been really good.

The meat is excellent, and everything is cooked very fresh as you can watch them prepare the food from the truck.

The only thing which prevents this place from getting 5-stars is the fact they do not have a selection of different salsas for you to pick from.  They do have a red sauce they put on for you, but not a salsa bar.  

The only thing I can say I didn't really enjoy from this place was their Nachos.  Just stick with the tacos and burritos; you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Went out for a late night snack with some friends. I ordered 2 of the mini quesadillas & 1 asada taco & 1 chicken taco just to get a taste of everything. 
Waited about 45 minutes to for some soggy quesadillas. 
Not bad but would of been better if they weren't soggy. Although The avocado and sauces were really good.  
Great price. Over all a pretty good experience. 
Chicken & meat tasted great! 
Was really upset about having soggy tortillas but 
From friends that have gone previously the quesadillas aren't usually soggy so ill definitely give them a second shot!"}
{"text":"This place serves cheap Mexican food in the late hours of the night...and you sit outdoors if you plan to dine so be prepared for that. 

We get there at 8p with a five person line. Waiting in the heat feels like five minutes is twenty. Prices are cheap - four tacos and a horchata drink = $6. 

We waited for ten minutes until our order was called. The Carne Asada and Chicken tacos had lots of filling, but lacked flavor. The horchata was good.

If you only got a couple of bucks to spare, and you need to have a hearty meal at one in the morning, this place will definitely offer you that! 

I don't wish to come back because it's too damn hot, but maybe when it gets cooler and I'll try their other items."}
{"text":"BEST carne asada tacos in AZ!!! Being Hispanic and growing up w/ good Mexican food, I have yet to find a spot that serves up carne asada better than this! The menu is inexpensive and TOTALLY worth it!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait! Only open at night but they stay open late so you can grab some post drinking grub. Always helps take the edge off those morning hangovers. Everyone is very friendly and hardworking so they move pretty fast to battle the line."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, so the line is REALLY long.

Amazing prices, amazing food.

White corn tortillas make me happy.

The Asada taco and mini-quesadilla are both incredible.

Not sure why it took me so long to get over here...I live literally blocks away."}
{"text":"Overrated! Always super busy, long lines, and long waits! The tacos are nothing out of this world. They also have nachos and other Mexican antojitos, but for the wait, I will go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Left hands down best tacos and quesadillas I've tasted in Phoenix. And cheap! Eat here especially after a drunken stupor. You'll love it. Promise."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Phoenix whether sober or drunk. You can't beat the $1 per taco! If you like nachos get the super mega nachos!!! It's a mix of gooey cheese, meat, and unicorns. Also ask for grilled onions and chiles to enjoy with your meal. The horchata is ok, but could be better. The wait is usually long after 9 pm but worth it!  My husband and I share the mega nachos and about 6 tacos and eat for under $20 with two drinks."}
{"text":"4.5 stars? That's ridiculous. This place deserves 5 solid stars. Period. Don't argue with me. A friend of mine introduced me to this place about 3 or 4 months ago and I have since gone back an embarrassingly amount of times. Actually, fuck that. I'm not embarrassed, it's tasty as HAIL. Hands down, the best street tacos in AZ. Not even joking. Every single person I introduce to this place becomes just as obsessed as I do. I go about every other week at this point on Thursday or Sunday. I honestly do not order anything other than the $1 tacos. I have no doubt their other items are really amazing as well, but I have no desire to cram anything into my mouth other than those sweet, sweet tacos. I usually order a mix of carne asada, pollo and \"vegetarian\" tacos, which is just black beans. I have never once been disappointed. They do have weird hours and are located next to Charlie's, so if you go here during peak hours (i.e., when the club lets out at 2am), you'll will be faced with a very large line. Things can get a little slow when it's busy. But hey, these people are creating ART. So you shut your pie hole and wait in line. The lovely lady who runs the register is extremely sweet and is a damn pro at dealing with the drunk fashionable men and random hobos who stroll in off the street looking for a handout.

But really, you haven't had a legit taco in AZ unless you've been here. America's Taco Shop? Nah. Gallo Blanco? Puh-leez. Dig the loose change out of the bottom of your purse/car cup holder and hit this place up for a taco or 5."}
{"text":"This taco truck is one and my only fav here in phx, I've been coming here for 3 years now! Wish they would come to Gilbert sometimes but I understand the demand is in phx, well recommended!"}
{"text":"Great taco truck that seems to cater to people who go out at night based on the hours. It is attached to Charlies as well which is probably why it's open til 2 or 4am on the weekends. The $1 Carne Asada or chicken street tacos can't be beat for the price! Lots of flavor and very tender, and the tacos include cabbage and avocado as well."}
{"text":"Ooooh I understand how this place gets packed very easily! For the price, the tacos were very good and satisfying! Very worth standing in line for. They are only $1!


The only downside is that they only offer chicken or carne asada for the tacos. It might be the same for burritos too, I'm not sure on that. It was really good! They are even open til 4am on weekends! Another plus for taking debit cards! In Cali, these places are usually cash only"}
{"text":"These are my go-to broke girl tacos. Can't beat a $1. The line generally moves at a good speed, the food takes a few minutes, also based on what you're ordered. In the winter it's pretty cold outside but they have heaters and it feels cozy. Sucks that they are only there 4 days out of the week, but with it."}
{"text":"Best street tacos I've ever had just wish they were bigger! The line is always so long it's that good!"}
{"text":"I've eaten lots of street tacos throughout the valley. I have to say these are by far the best and extremely reasonable in price."}
{"text":"The best tacos in Phoenix hands-down. Beautifully crafted street tacos, amazing mini quesadillas, and convenient late night hours. The only thing that would make this place better would be if they took takeout orders and stayed open seven days a week"}
{"text":"The best tacos in Phoenix. They're cheap and delicious. Nothing beats that. Their quesadillas are pricy at $7 but they are sooooo good! I come here whenever I am craving tacos or need a really late night snack even though it's far from where I live."}
{"text":"Best late night tacos and mini quesadillas for ridiculously cheap. Don't forget to get onions and peppers. 

I hate the wait, especially in the summertime heat. That's the worst. And so is the parking. 

Bring your strip club money because this sucker is cash only."}
{"text":"Epitome of street tacos! Taqueria Los Yaquis is by far some of the best tacos you can find."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for a while now as I have heard good things and of course the reviews on Yelp are great. Biggest disappointment ever. My fiance and I got a carne asada quesadilla, carne asada tacos, chicken tacos, and a bean burrito. They were all incredibly bland and I cannot for the life of me understand all the hype. All I can think of is that 99% of the people that go have already been drinking which of course must make the food somehow taste better than it is."}
{"text":"Some of the best street tacos I've had in Phoenix. 

Went here for the first time. It's a trailer with a kitchen attached to a bar and several picnic tables set outdoors facing Camelback Ave. There was 10+ people ahead of me in line and it moved slow since the cashier alternates taking orders with another line formed inside the bar. But it was worth the wait. 

I ordered a carne asada and chicken combination plate. It came with pinto beans, a generous serving of freshly chopped steak and chicken, a pile of grilled onions and a grilled jalapeno, with a choice of corn or flour tortillas to go with it.

I opted for corn. There was a stack of 6-7 of them and they were warmed and slightly crispy from the skillet. As I was handed my food, the woman in the trailer added the condiments over the meat with a ladle. It was good ! The tacos were hot and juicy with a delicious salsa over some cabbage with a touch of guacamole. The meat was well seasoned and high quality, like what you'd make in your own backyard grill. No nasty filiberto mystery meat here. 

This is my new favorite steak/chicken taco spot. Too bad it's not open regular hours. And I was hoping to see al pastor. But the carna asada is legit and the chicken was surprisingly good too. I liked Yaquis pollo and carne asada tacos more than Atoyac's examples."}
{"text":"One of the best tacos in the valley. As a San Francisco Bay Area native this is the closest to the bay you can get. I've been looking for a bomb taco place in Arizona and I finally did. Chicken tacos where not dry. Spicy. And very flavorful. Also the carne asada plate was just the same. The only negative is I wish they provided more tortillas.. Will ask next time!"}
{"text":"This taqueria serves up some of the best street tacos ever, and definitely in town. Stopped here over the weekend with some friends who had been before. The prices most definitely can't be beat; I got 2 tacos, a mini carne asada quesadilla and water for $5. The carne asada was flavorful and the toppings just added to the flavors. 

The location makes for some great people watching and the workers are friendly. If you're in the area it's a definite must-stop for some yummy Mexican favorites."}
{"text":"Tacos,  quesadillas were good.  Would have given 5 stars if tacos were offered with onion and cilantro."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for at least 10 years, pre food truck. The tacos have remained delicious whether you have been drinking or sober. I mean you can't beat $1 tacos. I always get the chicken tacos no salsa. I have had the carne asada tacos. The mini quesadillas are too cute! But I can't stand cheese, so I would never try them. One day I may order nachos, sans cheese of course! The lines can be very long and the seating is outside, so rain or shine you know what you are getting. Now that I have a son, I have introduced him to the ways of the street tacos, and he is a fan, my young jedi. The staff is friendly and professional! There are no restrooms so make sure you take care of that before or after, Charlies will charge you cover just to use their restrooms. Oh it is cash only."}
{"text":"The best tacos in PHX! 
I have been searching everywhere for the best Mex food!

HANDS DOWN!

I crave that horchata on the reg!"}
{"text":"We drove 30 mins because we heard this place was awesome! It's right next to a bar, which is super cute. The line was pretty long, but we got there about 30 mins from when they opened. We ordered 3 asada tacos, 3 pollo tacos, 1 mini asada quesadilla and a horchata = $10! What a steal. I thought the tacos were pretty decent, but the salsas needed some work. Again, $1/taco I couldn't really complain. Now, this is where I got my money's worth...the mini quesadilla was a hit! It was my favorite item, although, the horchata was nice and thick too. All in all, I have a very positive experience. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Best street tacos I have had in Phoenix for sure and only rivaled by a few places that I normally go to when I am in Tijuana. Very unsuspecting place. You'd probably never know it was even here unless you were looking for it or if you were going to the gay bar next door called Charlie's. Friendly clientele and amazing food. Only downside is they are only open Thursday through Sunday. Open late though. Til 3am. Avoid all the mediocre Berto's places and go eat here instead!"}
{"text":"What is all the hype about? Two-thirty in the morning and no where else to eat...perhaps. My tacos where missing the Guacamole and the cabbage tasted more like sauerkraut to me. The salsa was yummy and I prefer flour tortillas to corn. I saw that they accepted credit cards online however it was cash only the night I went."}
{"text":"Service isn't great specially if you get there after midnight during the weekend. Tables at dirty too. But other then that, food is ok and it's a good option."}
{"text":"Who knew that the best tacos in town would be attached to a gay club? Anything you order will satisfy! My favorite is the Asada tacos and mini quesadillas (Asada). I usually order two tacos and one quesadilla, the tacos is made on a corn tortilla and the mini quesadilla is made on corn as well. If you get a regular size quesadilla it will be on a flour tortilla, so decide before you order. Don't forget to get limes and extra hot sauce because you can never have enough spice and lime on your taco. 

The prices are amazing for the quality of food your getting (don't forget to bring cash) you can't go wrong with a $1 taco at 2AM. 

Parking can suck at times but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Perfect place.  Honestly I'm always puzzled when people go to taco Bell or some pretentious taco joint in Scottsdale.  You live in Arizona!!! Eat real tacos!  Eat here.  The place is fast, casual and tasty.

What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos!  Given that it's set up outside of a bar, you would think it wasn't the best in the world, but they really are yummy.  It's actually set up much like a permanent food truck but they have ample picnic style seating.   This is the place to go if you want some post-clubbing snacks at a pretty reasonable price.  They even have an ordering window which is located in outside area in Charlies."}
{"text":"Coming from Los Angeles, I am pretty up to speed on good Mexican food. After a night out at Charlies, we discovered this place that is basically attached to the bar (which is an awesome concept).

Originally, I did not order anything because I was not that hungry, but after having a bite of my friends chicken burrito, I immediately changed my mind.

Normally, burritos that you get from food trucks are a lot of beans and rice with some chunks of chicken mixed in. However, the burritos from this place are around 95% meat, which provides for a very filling and tasty meal.

Overall, I was very shocked at the great seasoning and flavorful taste of the food here and would definitely recommend it, drunk or otherwise."}
{"text":"Ive been here probably a dozen times. I love it. They're convenient, cheap, and delicious. Open late (like 4am or something like that) which is awesome because I don't get off work until midnight usually. Typically there's a croud and most times I've gone, I've had to wait at least 20 minutes for my tacos. But given the size of their kitchen and how many orders they take, they do a good job."}
{"text":"Visited Phoenix for the night and was in search of some authentic street tacos. The owners of the truck were super sweet and covered a dollar we were short on CASH ONLY so prepare in advanced. Most tacos are $2 and come with onions, cilantro, and cheese. I purchased two carna asada tacos and two carnitas. I was a bigger fan of their carnitas. Overall it was great and left us satisfied. Plus, their outside sitting is so cute and unique for a food truck."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place got such good reviews.   I went last night with high hopes and was totally let down.   

We got 8 Asada Tacos, 1 Nachos, 1 Quesadilla.   The asada was really bland with hardly any flavor at all.   Pretty tough to mess up asada in my opinion.  There were also a lot of pure fat pieces and then partially fatty pieces in our tacos.   It's like that was done on purpose.  There was hardly any guacamole in the tacos at all.   The hot sauce was really good, so there's one pro on the tacos. 

The quesadilla was supposed to be a kids version with cheese only...   they gave us asada and lots of hot sauce on it.   Not biggie, just made our boy one at home.   

Cooks were working diligently, there was plenty of staff for a food truck (7 employees inside truck) but the order still took 20 minutes, and there was no line when I ordered.   

Another part that left a bad taste in my mouth, not literally, was a crazy guy on drugs or super drunk was asking customers that were waiting for food for money.   Some would politely say \"no\", or \"I don't have any money\".   And the crazy guy wouldn't stop asking, or he'd tell them \"I know you're lying, just give me some money\".   He had bugged out eyes and everyone he spoke too was very uncomfortable or scared.   You would think the staff would have asked him to leave.   Not a big deal or the restaurant's fault, just really annoying and creepy.  

All and all, this was a total fail.   I had really high hopes because the reviews.   I only gave two stars because the kitchen staff was packed in and all of them were working with a sense of urgency."}
{"text":"Literally a hole in the wall (if you're ordering from the bar side). Lovely ladies tend to two completely different clientele flawlessly and as fast as they can. A truck nearby filled with cooks can barely keep up, they're busy and loud and absolutely delicious. I recommend their carne asada nachos but seriously everything in there is great, not to mention cheap!"}
{"text":"This is the greatest taco place ever. Its super affordable. The only thing is parking sucks so I parked across by the T-Mobile and then crossed the street. The line can get long just because they take orders from Charlie's customer as well. They have seating which is like a bench I don't have a problem with sitting next to people but if you do better take it to go."}
{"text":"This is my go-to taco spot on the weekends, even though it's so far from my house. The carne asada is where it's at. Praise the taco gods for reasonably sized $1 street tacos -- and honestly, these are a lot tastier than whatever prissy $4 taco you could get at Joyride or some other such trendy joint. These are the real deal. The truck is amazing actually; it's a bonafide industrial kitchen in that thing. The outdoor eating area isn't fancy, but the food is so good, you won't even care. I always get a few asada tacos and occasionally a $2 mini quesadilla (because cheese). And they're open late! Hashtag blessingsonblessingsonblessings.

*Pro tip #1: You can ask for grilled onions and they give you a pretty sizable plate. Can't remember if it's free or an extra $1, but either way it's worth it if you like onions.
*Pro tip #2: Their bottled sodas are a little small for my soda loving husband. We usually stop at a gas station for route 44s before heading over for tacos.
*Pro tip #3: The truck/bar is only a mile or so away from Churn, so there's that..."}
{"text":"This place is a good truck posted outside a LGBTQ club. That just made it more interesting.  Aside from that the steak burrito was very good,  very juicy meat,  and they got all the spices just right.  No complaints at all about this place and I would definitely return. Price is very fair as well."}
{"text":"The tacos were good. The Horchata was all right. The line was WAY TOO LONG.
Seems like the line is always long no matter when you go. The tacos are only a dollar each which is a really good price but I don't know how often I'm going to want to go just because of the wait."}
{"text":"It's cool in the sense that you can get really cheap tacos (other items aren't worth it) really late at night, either while clubbing or on the way home. We don't have enough places after 2am that are accessible on foot, so Los Yaquis is gonna be in high demand. 

My quesadilla was definitely small and bland for the $8, and nachos are just plain old nachos, like what you'd get at the movies or something. I will admit the meat tasted rather fresh, unlike other late-night spots, where it can sometimes sit around for hours. 

Apparently, I was also fortunate enough to avoid really long lines. It was pretty busy around 11pm on a Sunday, but there's no way in hell they have the capacity to fulfill the 2am rush. What drunk person is gonna chill out by a trailer, with no restrooms in sight while waiting for their order? Who is gonna keep people in check when people are (and i saw this firsthand) dramatically yelling at each other, or beggars are accosting every table? I can live with all this, but there's no way in hell you're going to eat in peace, something I don't deduct any stars for because it's not a real restaurant (it's a food truck that never moves).  There are totally times in which this will be the only option, and it won't be a terrible one. But at the same time, I can't imagine any reason someone would go out of their way for just decent Mexican fare."}
{"text":"Hands the best taco spot in Phoenix. The service is quick and the food is affordable! The line will always be long but your wait is never more than 10 minutes after ordering!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best tacos I've had.  The lines are long, but move quickly and well worth the wait. They're always busy so the carne asada is always freshly cooked. The salsas are delicious. Definitely my favorite taco place. It beats any of the higher end taco spots. If you are looking for authentic Mexican street tacos, this is your place!"}
{"text":"With the exception of opening up 45 minutes late, food was amazing. Great customer service and great food. The guy even gave me a few tacos on the house for waiting. Awesome place, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I don't see how people can like these tacos. The meat lacks flavor, and the salsa has no sazón. To have \"a great\" taco you need to have good meat, and good salsa. This place has neither. The only good thing was the kind of meat they use. Soft and tender. That's it."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place has great reviews. After hearing so many great words about the tacos I had to try it myself.  The lines where so long, I figured this must be great!  
I got the carne asada tacos and it was so bland and just plain. The meat had no flavor. The corn tortillas were dry and  tasted like they just got warmed up in the microwave.
 They must be popular because the location is right besides the bar and serves the bar outside and the food truck line on the opposite side.  Drunken tacos must be the ONLY reason for it 

I ended up going home and eating"}
{"text":"These tacos are AMAZINGGGGG. Totally worth the long line... At $1 each I'll take 10 the next time I come. New favorite late night spot! Fresh and so tasty!"}
{"text":"So good ! My favorite is the quesadilla with meat and everything on it! I'd dedicate my life to this and my kids are crazy over plain tacos! It's worth the long lines and wait ! Also I love Charlie's! Thankkkkkkk youuuuuuuuuuu. Oh I always be spotting crazy things around this area. You'll be entertained the drags talking and singing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat every Saturday night! 

The tacos are only $1.00 !!!! They come with guacamole sauce, red salsa, & cabbage, but you can get shredded cheese, nacho cheese, sour cream, jalapeños, & grilled onions on them for no extra charge!! 
 Also their burritos are huge. I would stay away from the nachos, they are basically gas station nachos. & Yes the line does get long, but it will be so worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here about once a week, and I always have to get a few carne asada tacos, mini quesadillas with everything and a side of grilled onions and jalapeños."}
{"text":"No puedo creer que hay tacos tan ricos aqui en AZ. Delicioso!!! Evie, thanks for turning me on to this joint! I think that these are the best tacos in town."}
{"text":"After a vacation that took us through Atlanta, Nashville, Louisville, and Chicago, my girl was longing for some \"Phoenix food\" Ie, tacos. So, when the plane touched down we took our tired a$$ selves down here, finally after all these years. She won't stop raving about them. So, if you take the circuitous route to enjoy the Kentuck Derby - by all means hit this place up afterward. It's a godsend. Figure at least 3 tacos per person if you are unfamiliar with how tiny street tacos are. 6 if you're hungry! 
There's not much cilantro (any?) but they have the guac on em so that works out okay. Its open til 4am on Fridays and Saturdays. The salsa isn't HOT until about taco two...it has a build up factor. We Parked at Charlie's. There are only like 5 spots available in front of the actual food truck, so plan on not parking at the location."}
{"text":"Wow. 

By FAR the best taqueria tacos that I have yet had in Phoenix!

Amazing find - I just ate there tonight and I am still dreaming of the delicate and perfectly cooked homemade tortillas used for the mini Carne Asada Quesdilla that I practically inhaled!. 

I almost missed ordering these \"mini size\" Quesadilla bad boys but saw a plate of these delicate morsels at a nearby table and I added them to the taco order.

OMG were they good. Sorry to gush, but each bite was pure bliss. 

Without a doubt - unequivocally - these are some of the best tacos and quesadillas that I have ever eaten. 

The place is a kind of hole in the wall with a small parking lot up front. You know you are in for an amazing food experience by three dead giveaways:  1) The massively long and slow line out front on a Sunday night (at least 30 min before being able to order - worth every minute!). 2) The sight and sound  of the cooks freshly chopping away at the tender Carne Asada on the block continuously - no pre-made dried out beef here. This is the tender melt in your mouth Asada of your dreams  3) The happy people eating at the tables nearby

Prices here are dirt cheap - Only $1.00 per taco, and about $2.00 for each mini Quesadilla. Our family of 3 filled up our hungry tummies for less than $20 including drinks.

Tacos were superb with a bit of cabbage, some spicy and flavorful homemade red salsa and a dab of salsa style guac. The tortillas are fresh, and extremely tasty. 

The only place I've ever had Taqueria tacos as good as this was in Mexico many years ago. 

The opening hours of this place are a little strange right?  

Open only Thursday through Sunday, mostly nights and late nights. No lunch possibility sadly. This must be related to opening at hours coinciding with the Charlie's bar just behind to feed the happily inebriated with some of the best munchies in the city lol.  

Taqueria Los Yaquis is now on my radar as a standout for delicious cheap eats - one of Phoenix's true gems -  some of the best tacos that this town has to offer. Yes, the tacos are exceptional but don't miss the \"mini\" Carne Asada Quesadillas ($2.00 each) as they are the big O."}
{"text":"Best late night Mexican food in Phoenix.  Seems to mainly be family owned. Very eclectic mix for quality people watching as well. $1 tacos are great - men will need at least 4 but they are delicate & insanely delicious. Burritos only $4. The price & taste are unrivaled."}
{"text":"I'm having mixed feeling writing this review because I feel like I'm cheating on my favorite taco shop back home in San Francisco, but Los Yaquis deserves praise from the highest of mountains. Where do I begin??? Well I just moved here not too long ago and tried a few taco places here in the valley and haven't had any luck with good quality tacos. So many gringo tacos I almost gave up hope. But low and behold thanks to some referrals and instagram I've found this gem and I'm so happy I did. There was a bit of a wait but it was well worth it!! The tacos were so soft and the meat was so flavorful with the perfect amount of spices. I can proudly say these have been the best tacos I've ever had!! I will be a regular customer"}
{"text":"Whoa... Tacos both asada and pollo were amazing! I'm use to Cali Mexican food and these were almost better than what I have ever had! Amazing tacos! Meat wasn't dry at all and they put the perfect amount of salsa and cabbage! Also gave a good amount of lime~didn't even have to ask for it. We got there at about 8pm, not too bad of a wait but by the time we left line was super long! Accepts cash only, but definitely going to be coming here again and again!"}
{"text":"After a long night of partying till 3 AM, you hit up gay tacos to sober up! This place is cheap and delicious. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Didn't love the cabbage on my tacos. But they were tasty. The nightlight of this place was the quesadillas. Get a bean and cheese quesadilla and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Open until 4:00 AM weekends. Great place to go when your hungry late at night, however there is always about a 30 minutes wait."}
{"text":"Great tasting tacos. I just wish they weren't so stingy with there salsa. There Horchata is also very good."}
{"text":"Hand down the best tacos I've ever had and they are only $1.00 you can't beat that. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. We has both the Pollo (Chicken) and the Asada (Beef) tacos along with the Asada Quesadilla which was Huge! And we also got the Super Mucho Nachos which was massive and had tons of gooey cheese. It's open for all you late night party goers that want late night eats....this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Mexican street food EVER!! Run by the nicest, sweetest people. Best carne asada tacos I've ever had. Blow's Americas taco shop out of the water. (Sorry America, your food is still good) impeccable service, get there early though. Lines are long and can take a while since only one order taker for the line outside and the drunks inside Charlie's."}
{"text":"BEST TACOS IN TOWN!! If you're looking for some real authentic Mexican food, this is the place to stop. I highly recommend the quesadillas w/carne asada. A little bit of a sketchy area, but worth it for these amazing tacos and their super reasonable prices. I also recommend a horchata with your food! I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"10 out of 10! There's already a ton of great reviews here on Yelp so I won't bother waxing poetic about how great this place is. Just go! If you don't like it, then you're the type of person should just go to Chili's or Taco Bell. It's authentic, it tastes great and it's like being in Mexico. One drawback, even though it's attached to a nigh club there is is no beer or booze served here."}
{"text":"Did a 2 am pit stop after a long night out... A quick and delightful meal on the go .., the line was not so bad at 2 am (lol).... All dish selections are a deal ... Andale????"}
{"text":"Best street tacos in Phoenix- delish and only $1!! Mini quesadilla's were also amazing. Absolutely worth my cheat meal"}
{"text":"I was craving some tacos (San Diego withdrawal symptoms) and had this place bookmared.  It was on the way home so I stopped.  The line was pretty deep and took about 15 minutes before I placed my order.  I ordered 2 pollo tacos, 3 carne asada tacos, one mini carne asada quesadilla and one mini pollo quesadilla.  Total for all that food was only $9.00!   Its $1.00 per taco and $2.00 per quesadilla. Here is how they were................

Pollo Taco-  This was my favorite of the bunch.  They have great tortillas and they top them with grilled chicken, guacamole, cabbage and hot sauce.  The cabbage threw me for a loop at first but it actually worked with these kind of tacos.  These tacos are super duper small....2 biters.  For a buck, they are fine.

Carne Asada Taco-  Same prep as the pollo.  The carne asada was flavored decent.  My tacos did have some gristle and fat in them.  They were fair.....compared to some spots in SD, nowhere close, but for Phoenix, they were decent.

Quesadillas-  These were topped the same way as the tacos but cheese and another tortilla was added.  Next time, I might just get cheese/meat.  The cabbage made these quesadillas worse.  Weird texture issues lol.  

Service was friendly enough.  Price was good but I was not blown away.  TONS of people were coming and going though so its pretty popular and may be the best Phoenix has to offer.  If so, Ill accept it but Ill continue to dream of SD taco shops!

That's about it.  Nothing super positive to say, and nothing negative to say.  It was A-OK!"}
{"text":"These tacos are delicious, cheap, and worth waiting for!

As someone who doesn't really enjoy tacos, I was skeptical about coming here. However, after that first taco... All I wanted to do was come back, and I did -- the very next day. I love the taco asada! The meat is juicy and tender, with spice added from the salsa and slight crunchiness from the cabbage. And it's only $1! I like to ask for lime wedges to squeeze on my tacos to add a slight acidic taste. I also tried a quesadilla, but I felt like the taco was easier to eat (not so messy). 

The horchata is also delicious and large, serving as perfect companion to those savory tacos with its sweet, slightly milky taste. And what a steal; 24 oz for only $2! 

The line does get long sometimes, but it moves fairly quickly. Bear with it! The food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Hey Phoenix! Did you know you can get $1 tacos and it doesn't even have to be taco Tuesday? Tacos here are $1 your choice of beef or chicken. They are a bit small, but they are good.... well prepared on a yummy tortilla with cabbage, guacamole and salsa. They also have nachos, burritos, and combo plates. Most things other than the tacos are either $4 or $7. Horchata is $2 for a 24oz cup and you do not get refills. They also have bottled drinks for $1 or $2 depending on the drink. (They probably make their money off the drinks because of the cheap tacos.) Also, they have a $5 minimum for card purchases as well as a 50 cent charge. Quick yummy and cheap tho only open at night."}
{"text":"The tacos at this place are little bundles of goodness that are damn near perfection. To begin the carne asada has great flavor with a slightly charred and crispy exterior, but still manages to maintain some tenderness on the inside. The cabbage, guacamole, and salsa are a necessary addition to this masterpiece of a taco. And just when you think you have it all... bam! Grilled onions complete one of the best tacos in Phoenix. On top of it all, these bad boys are only $1 a piece. 

Now on to the less glamorous side of Taqueria Los Yaquis, or the underbelly if you will. The establishment is inconspicuously housed just west of 7th Ave on Camelback Rd under a tent with some plastic tables and sporadic misters outside of Charlies gay bar. Here you will find some flaming fairies and hordes of legit Mexicans flocking in from all angles. Once you reach your destination you can watch the cooks working tirelessly in a food truck (one of the cleanest I've seen) to prepare you meat-filled pockets of love. God bless them. 

There are two ordering lines: one is literally a hole-in-the-wall inside Charlie's and the other a general line outside which accommodates all. This dual line and alternating order-taking results in ridiculously long waits of up to 20-30 minutes. I prefer to go on Sunday afternoons when it gets real, and a lil' less... uh... gay."}
{"text":"Wow! I had both chicken & steak mini quesadillas, as well as chicken & steak tacos. Everything was fantastic. I rarely get steak tacos anywhere but these are so good that I'll be getting more for sure. The chicken mini quesadilla was perfect. I'll be back for some late night tacos again soon."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here and both times I was not disappointed. Get there early because the lines do get long but it's worth the wait. I got the carne asada tacos and mini quesedillas, total of 4 tacos and 2 minis at 8.00 is a great price. This fed both javier and I. They are not skimpy with the meat and it has lots of flavor. The red salsa also has a good kick to it. I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"You can't imagine how delighted I am to find such a place in Arizona! My friends and I have resorted to fast food late night meals after a night of going out and that's just depressing. 

The truck is located right outside Charlie's gay bar on the corner of Camelback and Florence, right before you hit Florence. You will see the sign for Charlie's first so just pull into their parking lot. The club was bumpin that night so the lot was full but the taco stand had almost no line Sunday at 11pm. Even though there were security guards by the club and my friend was a guy, I still felt a little nervous because there were definitely some shady looking people hanging out nearby. So if you're a chick make sure to go with a group. Don't let this deter you from going though, as we sat and ate there were plenty of groups coming by (couples, college kids, high school kids) so I felt more at ease. 

As for the food, I was craving  a hot dog but I obviously wanted the tacos. Solution= I got both (sorryimafatty). Skip on the hot dog unless you're really craving it, its just a grilled ball park dog and I prefer mine all beef. Came with a side of Doritos which I gave to my friend. 

TACOS HOWEVER were delicious! I got mine with all the toppings; the red sauce they put on there is spicy! It burned but that roasted red chili pepper taste is so good. I got the pollo and asada.. both were good but I definitely preferred the flavor of the asada more. My friend got the Asada burrito and devoured it! Burrito had the same toppings as the tacos: red sauce, guac, cabbage and onions. Also ordered a Horchata which was meh: watered down, gritty, and not very sweet or cinnamon-y . 

Prices are more than reasonable, service is very friendly and food is excellent! They're only open Thursday to Sunday nights, I will for sure be back. Maybe I'll check out the bar this time too ;)"}
{"text":"For cheep street tacos this place does it right. I haven't tried anything else but the carne and pollo asada tacos. The wait is to be expected for a place this good. Will be returning for a place this good."}
{"text":"This was stop 3 on the taco tour last night with Jon and Amy H. This place is certainly the best deal for tacos in town at 1$ per taco ... the ambience... well, not so much. It's a semi permanent truck sort of situation with some picnic tables outside of a bar. The husband and I shared the pollo mini quesadilla (2$) and the carne taco. The taco was just ok... nothing terribly special, but good for 1$. The quesadilla was really good... very flavorful, and I usually don't love chicken at taco shops, but this was good. I would come back for that. We also had the horchata.... this was not so good... too watery and too much cinnamon.... I couldn't even really drink it. Anyway, I think this place is good for the price, but I wouldn't be rushing back here for a taco."}
{"text":"Real deal tacos and served quick. Freshness factor and guacamole kept it from 5 stars. The cabbage and gauc needed work. I'd return though."}
{"text":"i absolutely love this place! you cant beat $1 tacos and $2 mini quesadillas and $2 horchata with mini guac and chili on the side and dort forget the grilled onions and jalapenos. i come here like 4 times a month. the wait is worth it. have cash only they dont do debit and parking is in the lot of the gay club. you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands down best tacos I've ever had. I will drive way out of my way to come get these tacos! There is always a long line, which is a good sign! There is typically a 20-30 minute wait, but they are so worth it! I would give 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"This is the best carne asada I have ever had!!  It is the embodiment of perfection when it comes to carne asada.  Get extra meat if you order a burrito, it's just a dollar more.  Or get a bunch of street tacos (they're $1!!).  The quesadilla (with carne asada of course) is out of this world.  

The line is LONG on weekend nights, especially late.  I'm not sure what the hours are, I believe it is just late at night.  I have waited over an hour for this.  I have left (extremely disappointed) when I knew the wait would likely be quite a bit longer than that.

More than one person has told me that they don't particularly like carne asada in general, but this place is out of this world.  I'd give it more than 5 stars."}
{"text":"Was driving home with the wifey from a night out in Scottsdale. \"Let's get some street tacos!\" I said.  Quickly launched the Yelp app and came across this place.  Hmmmm, 4 and a half stars, pics look tasty, and jam packed. It must be good, right?  WRONG!!!!

This place is awful. I mean really really awful. Nothing we ate tasted good.  We had a chicken quesadilla, a steak quesadilla, a bean/cheese burrito, and asada tacos. They all sucked. The asada was bland and dry.  No salt at all.  Just charred pieces of meat.  The chicken was flavorless. The tortillas were stale. The bean and cheese burrito was an absolute disaster.  Please see the picture i posted.  No, that is not a plate of beans we ordered on the side.  That came out of 1/2 a burrito.  Bland, flavorless beans and some cheese wrapped in a greasy, half-ass-wrapped tortilla.  And who puts minced cabbage on steak tacos? The only taco that should have cabbage on it, is a fish taco. And the cabbage should be shredded, not pulverized.  The red sauce was not spicy at all, and lacked any kind of authentic Mexican flavor.  No condiments anywhere.  No variety of sauces, no radishes, no pickled jalapeños & carrots.  They just throw a couple of dried up lime wedges in your plate.  I saw a few people with some roasted jalapeños on their plate, but you have to specifically ask for it.

Quite possibly the worst taco joint I've ever been to.  The people who gave this place 5 stars should really get out more often.  This place is garbage.  Try PHX Burrito House down the street.  Much, MUCH better.  But those f***ers close early.  Or, for the best tacos and burritos in all of Phoenix, head over to Ta Carbon on 43rd near Thomas or on 59th near Camelback.

By the way, I ate there at 10:30.  I'm writing this review at 11:30...from my toilet!"}
{"text":"This place has become a statement of my diet. It is a must have on the weekends, when open. Any time I have friends in town, I take them to experience the best street tacos in the valley. Make sure to have cash, and have enough time to wait in line-- it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I love love love love these taco the chicken taco are the best great music and if your felling hungry head over here when they open they get packed pretty fast! By far the best taco in Arizona !!"}
{"text":"This place is the BOMBdiggity!!!  The huge line is definitely worth the wait. I could eat here every night, and everything on the menu is of the chain delicious."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for great mexican food. We came last year and couldn't wait to get back here. The carne asada tacos for 1 dollar are delicious. This time I also added the mini quesadilla, one of my new favorites! If you are sensitive to spicy food just get the tacos without the salsa. These are the best tacos ever. We are picky and from southern California so we know our mexican food. THIS IS A MUST GO TO PLACE."}
{"text":"Those nachos are the best. I've been going here for 3 years and I've never ever ever been dissapointed. It's not fine dining but it hits the spot after a night of dancing and cocktails. I will admit that the wait does suck. It's often a long line."}
{"text":"Love this spot. The only Mexican food place my Mexican novia likes. 
Get there early as there is always a huge line."}
{"text":"Great tacos and even better prices.  Only down side is the lines are always long bit it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is literally the best taco truck I've ever had! I came to visit a friend in Phoenix and we went here after a night of fun at Charlie's. Not only is the food amazing and full of flavor, but it's beyond reasonable. Tacos are only a $1.00 and oI don't remember anything being over $7.00. It was so good I went here twice during my visit to Phoenix. I tried the carne asada tacos, super nachos with asada, mini quesadilla with chicken and another one with carne asada. I think the quesadilla tastes best with asada. 

If you love authentic Mexican food, you must try Taqueria Los Yaquis!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best late night eat in Phoenix.  There will be a little wait, and your eating outside. But done despair, this is the BEST carne asada you've ever had. 

It's a late night tradition, I think, to gorge yourself on their food on Friday and Saturday nights. And if your not... Your loss."}
{"text":"So this review below was reported by someone with no life and taken down by Yelp because it \"didn't reflect a 1st hand experience.\"

\"Why are you reading this and not standing in line? Bring cash...it's worth the wait. Waiting for it to open as we speak.\"

Let me clarify that I HAVE EATEN HERE WHY WOULD I SAY THAT THIS IF I HAD NOT BEEN HERE?! My god...sorry for yelling."}
{"text":"5 stars for their tasty tacos but 3 stars for their meat selection. 

First off, they had me at $1 tacos! We walked in on a Friday night and we let the line speak for the place. Fortunately, the line did not take too long and we were able to get out orders in.

We scarfed down our food as soon as we got it. Needless to say we were hungry and the way the meat was seasoned and cooked was on point. At least we know quality was not lost on a busy night like this.

Definitely will return if I'm ever driving around Phoenix during their hours of operation."}
{"text":"It's a little sad how many times I've been here and been buzzed or flat out drunk. And when I wake up the next morning with burrito wrappers in bed with me I think, Hey, at least *something* came home with me last night. Then I eat the extra burrito I drunk ordered and call it a good day.

Okay, seriously, this place is wunderfundle! Whenever I'm heading home late on a Friday, this is my final stop before going home. While the tacos are probably some of the best I've ever stuffed in my face, the bean and cheese burrito is my standard order. Two of those bad boys, actually. And in a pinch, they're in the lot with Charlie's. You know, for times when I want more than a burrito in bed."}
{"text":"Since they have such amazing reviews and I saw a huge line of course I decided \"what the heck, I may as well check this place out!\" since it was a beautiful night out in Phoenix. Overall the prices are amazing but the wait was not really something I would want to do again. Especially battling another hidden line on the bar side of Charlie's. I'm more interested to go hang out there and make a new gbff & see what they have to offer! I did enjoy my combo plate though and the horchata did taste better once I had some spice in my mouth already."}
