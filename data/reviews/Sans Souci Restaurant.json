{"text":"Very good burger for lunch.  A little pricey like any hotel.  Server was attentive and nice.  Loved the pickles and got Open Table points!"}
{"text":"Bouillabaisse. If you're a seafood lover, then this is the only word you need to know when ordering at Sans Souci. Fantastic broth with super fresh seafood (GIANT, sweet scallops). Husband ordered their special - striped sea bass with an asparagus cream sauce and risotto blinis. Also fantastic. The server will bring out an impressive platter of breads to start you off - make sure to try their tapanade; it's quite tasty. Also try their butter. I swear it's not some ordinary butter!  Extremely attentive service here, but you'd expect that from a restaurant of this type. Fancy schmancy place without being pretentious. We were fortunate enough to have the back dining room to ourselves (visited on a Tuesday, so guessing this wouldn't be the case on a weekend). The ambiance was perfect - a table next to a fireplace with two beautiful murals of what we think was the French countryside. Nice wine list (highly recommend the sangiovese) and several tempting appetizers. We had the scallop trio and I could've ordered up a few of those as my main entree - d.e.l.i.c.i.o.u.s!   Save room for dessert!! No worries - a classy joint like this packages up your leftovers in a stunning tinfoil swan. We splurged and got a flourless chocolate cake and a apple cheesecake purse, which was a small cheesecake topped with baked apples all in this phyllo dough \"purse\" and drizzled with warm caramel and served with vanilla bean ice cream. Both were well worth the calories!  We'll definitely go back. Truly top-notch cuisine and service."}
{"text":"Skip it. Gordon Ramsay, Bobby Flay, and Michael Simon couldn't turn this place around.  Came with a party of 10 that had a reservation.  Outdated and worn decor. Dirty wine glasses and silverware. We should have never sat down since the restaurant was almost empty at 7:30 on a Saturday night....never a good sign. The wine list is not up to date with their inventory. We had to settle with 2nd and 3rd choices from the list AND then the wines were not the vintages printed. The food was less than mediocre. The steaks were dry and over cooked. The broccolinni was almost raw. They ran out of baked potatoes and strip steaks....really?! The few people that did get potatoes were stuck with a dry, shriveled up spud. The service was slow. Water glasses were never refilled during dinner even when requested. Cocktails took painfully long to arrive. The manager, while apologetic, was powerless to remedy the situation.  An epic fail. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"WHAT HAPPENED HERE??? This was my favorite restaurant in Cleveland for 30 years. What the heck happened? I was there twice in 4Q  2012 and I won't go back. The menu has changed (odd). I did not care for the meals.     I recall when a reservation had to be made well in advance. Not any more.... you can walk in. The lively restaurant I once knew is gone. The place is dead.  I don't think that  the Casino took biz away from Sans Souci as some people have rumored. The Casino has a glorified food court, no real restaurants. Sans Souci has gone down on its own.  The coffee that came with our dessert was TEPID!  How do you screw that up?  What a loss. It used to be such a fine restaurant.  I'll take people to Tremont or to the Warehouse District and get a better meal for the money.   PS: I don't like having to get a key for a rest room that is a half mile down the hall."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Cleveland for a nice dinner out.    GOOD STUFF:  Fine dining old school style....the old cigar lobby next to the bar is amazing....hints to when Cleveland was booming...high ceilings with lots of marble.  The restaurant is very formal (dress nice) and overlooks public square.  Food is always good...try the lobster pasta...really great dish that used to be only a special but now is always offered.  BAD STUFF:  Expensive.  Not an everyday dinner kind of place.  Use this one for your special occasion dinners.  PRICE:  Expensive...aprox 120 for two people with wine.  OVERALL:  My favorite place for a special occasion dinner in Cleveland, right on public square, good food, and very fancy."}
{"text":"Food is excellent although the portions are small compared to similar venues. Romantic ambiance, excellent wines, great service. Great place for a special date."}
{"text":"I am giving this 4 stars based on the experience and the interaction with the chefs (which ... as a foodie, totally made my day). Had the chefs not come out I probably would have given this 3 stars and I will tell you why....  We went to Sans Souci for my husband's birthday. We made a reservation for 8 PM. We probably didn't need a reservation as this place was pretty empty which I found odd for an upscale restaurant on a Saturday night. it was so quiet in there, it was a little awkward.  The inside is very nice, kind of french country. We got to sit right next to the enormous fireplace. The staff was very friendly. The waitress quickly brought us the wine list which was quite nice and not ridiculously over priced.  Next came the dinner menu and specials. I was so bummed when I did not see the bouillabaisse on the menu. All the reviews I read about this restaurant raved about the bouillabaisse and I had my heart set on it. I asked the waitress and she said it was removed from the menu. BUMMER!!!  our waitress brought out a basket with a variety of breads and a small tray with whipped butter, sun dried tomato/artichoke and olives, and pesto spread. The pesto was delicious!!!! at this point we were ready to order but our waitress left and was nowhere to be found. Where could she be? there was only about 4 tables occupied. My only other gripe is that they don't have a restroom in the restaurant. You have to hike it down the hotel main lobby area. What kind of 5 star restaurant doesn't have a restroom? They also don't have a bar inside the restaurant and the waiters have to of to the hotel lobby bar to get the drinks.. Perhaps thats why our waitress would get lost  for 20 minutes.   The Sous Chef came out to deliver food to the table next to us several times while we were waiting for our waitress to come back. He was presenting each dish and wine pairing. I was wondering why these people were getting such special treatment.  We finally figured out that were sitting next to a food writer and food critic! How awesome is that??? A few minutes later the Sous Chef came over to chat with us. He very easily convinced me to have the special which was a Chilean Sea Bass with saut√©ed spinach and veggies in a white wine sauce topped with a poached egg. He suggested the rib eye for my husband.   We started off with the smoked salmon mac n cheese as an appetizer. It was very good. I was smoked salmon with orzo pasta and goat cheese topped with bread crumbs.  Then came the entrees. The Sea Bass was absolutely melt in your mouth delicious with a perfectly poached egg. I would definitely order that again. The rib eye was good. My husband ordered medium rare but it was a little more on the rare side, we didn't want to send the dish back and since i like my meat rare we switched plates. The rib eye dish came with steamed carrots and a celery root puree which was very good. I'm not crazy about steamed carrots so I didn't eat many of those but everything else was pretty good but I have to say I have had a better steak dish at downtown 140 in Hudson. But to be fair, it was a nice steak, however, they had the cheapest steak knives... seriously it was like I was sawing my steak in half.. not impressed.  The the executive sous chef came over to chat with us several times during dinner which made for a very fun night for a couple of foodies! and the executive chef came out towards the end of the meal to wish my husband a happy birthday. I asked them what they suggested for dessert and they said they had it covered. They brought us a sample platter with a triple chocolate moose, truffles, berries and a cheesecake. Every single item was delicious and the dessert was on the house!   To wrap this up... I have to say my very first impression with in the first 15 minutes of sitting in the restaurant, I was not immediately impressed, but I hand't tasted anything yet. as the night went on it just got better and better. I don't know if this was only because the food critics were sitting next to us or if the chefs come out every night and chat it up with the guests. I do think we will be back and I do recommend this restaurant. We had a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and I was pleasantly surprised.  The buffet breakfast costs $18 and includes coffee and juice.  It has the usual stuff, including omelets made to order.  I opted instead of scrambled eggs with smoked salmon ($14, but beverages not included) which was very nice.  There were bits of salmon scrambled into the eggs and larger whole pieces laid on top.  The coffee was very good.  Everything was quite satisfactory and I would have given Sans Souci a solid three stars, but my server, Dennis, turned a satisfactory breakfast into an excellent one.  I don't usually factor individual servers into my reviews (you might not get Dennis) but my standard for four stars is \"would I consider this as a place to come back to in preference to others\" and Dennis has given me happy memories, so yes.  The restaurant looks good and is pleasant and well-lit.  I would go out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"This place is a conundrum. The menu looks like fine dining. The decor was old-fashioned, and not in a good way. Needs a good cleaning (the windows were filthy), an update of fabrics and paint (out with the murals!), and a beer list from the bar across the lobby. The back area full of huge cookware is probably supposed to look like a Mediterranean kitchen, but made me feel like I was looking at a storage area.  Service was mediocre. Hostess was very friendly. Server could benefit with some lessons in fine table service--wine pouring, interstitial table clearing, etc. He wasn't rude, just ... lacking in warmth and give-a-sh!t. Maybe that comes from working in a hotel restaurant.  Food was fine. Overpriced, but nothing inherently wrong with it. I probably shouldn't have broken my rule about ordering something that's partially in quotes (saltimbocca is made with veal, and chicken \"saltimbocca\" is not an acceptable substitute, my mistake). My dining partner's fish entree looked very good."}
{"text":"This place is nothing if not classy. I love the views of Public Square directly out the window. I tried some of the bacon and lox at breakfast and was very happy with what I tried. Coffee for anyone who comes in at the hostess station in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars.   I booked through open table and requested flowers and iced champagne at table side.  We arrived on time and were promptly shown our table with a very tasteful floral display on the table.  They had a bottle ready for us popped the bottle and poured right away for us.  The wine was very pleasant, lightly fruited and semi dry.  I then asked what it was and it was only a 49 dollar California sparkling wine.   My compliments to the staff.   They easily could have put the most expensive bottle out.  But they gave us a nice bottle at a reasonable price.  The staff was very friendly, not the highest level service but prompt and efficient.  The food unfortunately was a mixed bag.  Good:  my three course special started out with a fresh light cucumber and tomato salad with local mixed greens, goat cheese and a delicate vinaigrette.  The main course was  local pasta with lobster sauce which I found quite tasty.  Bad:  we had the charcuterie which was Giant Eagle level at best, served with what looked like Ritz crackers and Dijon mustard. My wife ordered the filet with crab cake, esparagus, and hollandaise aside.  I can't recall seeing the sauce.  The filet was over cooked, and not very flavorful.  The crab cake was light on crab and heavy on cake.  The asparagus looked like tree trunks.  It had been a few years since I have been to this restaurant.  It seems like they have given up trying to compete.  Too bad.."}
{"text":"Julie  3 1/2 Stars but I will round up because of the fabulous lemon custard.  Bread basket with olive spread.  A nice start with my glass of Kendall Jackson Vinatner's Chardonnay.  Started with a Valencian Salad made with Baby Spinach, Frisee, Roasted Garlic Vinaigrette, Piquillo Pepper, Marcona Almond, Spanish Olive, Orange Supremes.   Enormous portion and big enough to share for 2.  Well mixed and a refreshing taste.  3 1/2 stars.  The entree was the restaurant's famous Bouillabaisse with Shrimp, Clams, Mussels, Lobster, Scallops, Rouille Croutons.  There was also a beautifully done with salmon in the seafood mix as well.  The lobster and scallops were a bit chewy.  The sauce/soup was mild and nicely done to my taste and great for dipping the croutons (bread).  I was not overly impressed with this dish and it gets 3 stars.  The best was the lemon custard which is probably one of the best desserts that I've ever had.  It was recommended by the waitress as I was trying to decide between the apple tart or trio of creme brulee and boy am I glad that she stopped me.  I'm not a fan of lemon but there was only a slight hint of lemon flavor.  What this was, was a perfectly made light custard in an angel food cake topped with a flaky coating that was caramelized....  OMG ... wait for it...  \"Legen- Dary\"  It wasn't the the custard or the angel food cake or the caramelized top... It was just that it was such a perfect mix that it didn't taste like a creme brulee or a cake or anything that I've ever tasted...  This dish alone is worth the trip to Sans Souci.    6 BIG STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's kind of sad that I was one of 3 tables in the whole place.  In NYC, this place would have a week's wait for a reservation.  The service was impeccable and the atmosphere romantic and cozy.  I had a nice table to myself over looking the square in downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant in Cleveland's Terminal Tower complex.  It has seats looking out on public square.  It is in the Renaissance hotel and has classic charm similar to the Drake in Chicago or William Penn in Pittsburgh.  It is very reasonably priced for lunch.  The serving staff is old school with manners and techniques that should be passed down.  Beautiful tables and decorations.  Would like to try it for dinner on a Holiday."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and all my visits following the first were progressive worse. On my most recent visit I ordered a rueben to be safe, only to be disappointed by the sandwich construction. Who the fuck puts the thousand island dressing on the bottom slice of bread, only to pile on top the thickest cuts of corned beef. On top of that, my sandwich was prepared what I can assume was moments after I ordered. It came out with the rest of groups food as a cold, soggy mess, cheese no longer melting and falling apart wtf!!"}
{"text":"Sans Souci does a fantastic job with their food... good wine list.  Cocktails, however, leave a lot to be desired.  They're shuttled in from the lobby bar of the Renaissance Hotel, which houses Sans Souci.    The bouillabaisse is wonderful.  The scallops with pork belly are heavenly.  Never had any bad food here.  The lamb 2 ways is outrageous.  With atrocious cocktails and merely good service, I can't go 4+ stars.  Still, though, with 4.5 star food, this is on our not-terribly-long list of places we like to get to at least once or twice a year."}
{"text":"OK, so here's the deal. I had to tell Ellis, the Maitre'D that he needs to tell the chef to pause and hear my praise. I said it straight up. I've got family in Paris and in New Orleans so I know a good bouillabaisse when I taste one, and this one is superb. Superb I say.   The service was right on time, and I just enjoyed a very refined and elegant evening. The only way it could have been better was if I had a French runway model tugging on my arm begging me to get out of there. Instead I had to do with a fat history book, which can be almost as good when you're as old as me.   A nice selection of breads and wine rounded off an excellent bowl. I highly recommend this joint on a night when there are fewer loudmouth feminists around."}
{"text":"We went here for our anniversary dinner Nice atmosphere Good bouillabaisse Tuna tartar was just ok, had bits of fishy gristle (bleh) In general, the meal was good and well prepared, but it didn't really inspire a \"Wow I really have to eat here again\" feeling in me So, 4 stars, not 5"}
{"text":"The 1 star is for our wonderful waitress... I don't quite know where to begin. I went with 2 friends during the 2013 Restaurant Week and we ordered from the special menu. The appetizers and bread were great but the entrees were mediocre at best. The pasta with mussels and clams wasn't flavorful at all. The entire dish tasted old as if it were pre-made a couple of days before and reheated just before serving. My friend's lamb was cold when it arrived to the table and bland. Our desserts, the caramel torte, were stale with caramel sauce and whipped cream.   Definitely not worth $30/person not including our $9 glasses of wine or $4 cup of coffee. Needless to say, we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Hotel guests over weekend, stopped in for Sun breakfast buffet due to limited time to go elsewhere,  Front hostess sold the buffet well, was friendly and prompt.  Our server didn't really direct us to buffet so we kinda asked (not a big buffet mind you) to go up.    The focal point is the omelet station.  The chef stepped away after sweeping the floor area...creating a line.  About 5-6 options of ingredients, and 2 eggs or 3.  But he used some liquid oil instead of a cooking spray.  Started a 3rd burner up to help the line.  But he flipped the omelets over before done, causing them to break.  Amateur hour!  He also used latex-type gloves to hand pull the ingredients from each container.  Cross-contamination for those with allergies.  Lady in line had allergies to onions.  Also had a waffle maker- but had to take cooked  waffle to table to put on butter then go back get the syrup or use a coffee cup and improvise. There were also usual scrambled eggs, bacon, and turkey sausage and grilled veggies, and some smoked salmon as other options, plus cereals and yogurts.  The casino buffet didn't open til 11am, so this worked.  But not worth $17.99."}
{"text":"I can't give this place any review about its food, as I was turned away by its rude hostess. I came in for a glass of wine and to read the Wall Street Journal since my work day had ended early.  I probably would have ordered a salad or salmon, but I didn't want her or the waiter to be put out for little old me in case I didn't. Mind you, I am a professional, dressed in professional attire- I may look young but I can and do spend and tip in high end restaurants. The hostess told me that the waiter was too busy to accommodate me and I suggested that I could sit at one of the outer tables, since I wasn't sure if  I would be eating. She rudely stated that I had to sit inside - to which I replied that perhaps I should dine elsewhere (based on her attitude ). Glad I did."}
{"text":"Three stars seems a little harsh but I can't quite bring myself to endorse 4.  Went here as part of Restaurant Week and it's certainly a nice place, but my friends and I were unimpressed by the food.  You'll have a good meal if you come here, but there's nothing to elevate this place to be truly memorable.  I ordered the osso bucco, which was really tender and the portions were generous and I had enough for lunch the next day.  My blood orange sorbet had a good flavor, but it had that icey consistency of when something melts and then is re-frozen.    I like the ambiance at Sans Soucci -- great views and the feeling that you're in a really classy wine cellar.  Also, I like that it takes advantage of downtown and makes you feel like you're in a nice restaurant in an actual city, especially since Cleveland restaurants seem to be relocating to upscale stripmall in the suburbs.  Overall, I liked Sans Souci but I'd probably opt to try a new restaurant than go back.  I think what we were most strucky by at dinner was how COLD we were.  We went during a cold front with temps in the teens and had a hard time really getting comfortable because we were shivering throughout dinner.  If you're going to Sans Soucci and it's winter -- bundle up!"}
{"text":"If you live in Cleveland, the discussion should begin and end with \"Sans Souci\" when you ask yourself the question, \"Where should I take my significant other for a special anniversary\occasion?\"  I honestly have no complaints about this place. Not one. The food here is fabulous--sure, it's not cheap, but were you expecting it to be cheap? More importantly, they give you large portions...I think some fancy restaurants think that cats, not humans, are dining in their restaurants because their portions are so small! Not Sans Souci--they give you plenty! It's quite delicious too...I don't think there was anything that we ordered that wasn't perfect.  The interior decor is extremely appealing and the paintings on the walls are gorgeous. I'd love to have the artists paint the inside of my house. On the night I went here, there were gale-force winds outside, but the soft and sunny interior made us feel like we were sitting in a European cafe. If you prefer a view, make sure you get a table by the windows, which overlook Cleveland's Public Square! We didn't go here during Christmas, but I can imagine that dining next to Cleveland's wonderful holiday decorations would be a magical experience. =)  The service is great too--when I went here, it was late on a Saturday night and the place was pretty empty, yet we never felt neglected.  i recommended this place to a buddy for his first anniversary with his girl and I did not have any qualms about doing so whatsoever because I knew that this place never disappoints. If David Beckham called and asked me where he should take Victoria in Cleveland, I would tell him to go to Sans Souci and not worry at all about how their dining experience would turn out. I can't wait until I can go here again!"}
