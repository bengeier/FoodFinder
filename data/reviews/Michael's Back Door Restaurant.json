{"text":"Embarrassing disappointment! Hosted 4 friends from out of town, who expressed desire for good Italian food. Checked Yelp reviews; even asked couple of different friends who lived in Oakville, who gave thumbs up.
They were all wrong. Supposed Pernod sauce on Bass special was thick and bland, linguine was mushy and veal spezzatino was fatty. There was some spice included that left poor aftertaste.

My guests would certainly not have insulted me by complaining, and I was not going to make a scene in front of them, but I was very embarrassed, as I had selected your place.

Owner/manager was very friendly and kind, and service was efficient and friendly, but not polished.

I actually emailed an apology to my friends next day, saying I would not go back to this restaurant. They agreed with me!

I had originally chosen Julia or Ritorno; should have gone with those choices.

Gave one star because \"no stars' not offered as an option."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place very much. The food was great and the looked as great as it tasted. It's not very big but cosy. Service was ok but food made up for it."}
{"text":"The food is top notch and high quality and nice big glasses of wine value priced. We will be back. The floor plan is a bit weird and officey but what's on the plate and in the glass more than makes up for it. Definitely try the veal and rack of lamb. Very generous portions and every bit as nicely done as say Via Allegro, which is saying something indeed. Definitely not over priced for the value received."}
{"text":"I went to Michaels with my fiance for our anniversary dinner. I am in the Clarkson area quite a bit, but have never been inside the restaurant.  Our waiter (can't remember his name), was friendly, explained our questions wonderfully and service was great.  

I am a food allergy sufferer, and for anyone who has a food allergy, sometimes eating out is difficult and embarrasing (for me anyways). I find that restaurants become afraid of an allergic person, but perhaps if they were confident in their kitchen and knew their ingredients... maybe this wouldn't be the case.  At Michael's back door, not only did they already know that I had an allergy (they actually read the reservation), but the waiter was confident and reassuring that I could order whatever I wanted (obviously without the allergen in it) and would be fine.  Not one time did they make it seem like an issue or an inconvenience.  This is obviously an important topic for me.

The portions were bigger than we expected, yes they are a little higher price than others...but I'm not sure what people think when they see a casual fine dining restaurant/piano room?  There are plenty of lower cost restaurants around to choose from.  We both had veal, I had salad, my fiance had soup and we both had dessert, all delicious. The other thing I wanted to mention is that it is a small place, and they did have a larger party beside us... oddly you don't notice this while you're eating... perhaps its the atmosphere of the restaurant its not loud. 

Because of the service, the way we were treated and of course the food, we will be back to celebrate."}
{"text":"Mediocore service, expensive. Food is decent, portions are large, wine list is Italian and US heavy which is fine. The wine markup is high. Don't plan on returning there are better places to spend my dollars."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place, but after going was a bit disappointed in the food. The bean soup is good, but my main fell short. My venison special was way overcooked as were the vegetables it came with which were hard to eat because they were so limp and soggy. Setting is nice and service was good, but the food just wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"A fantastic restaurant and one of our favourites. It's the one place we will go back to over and over again. The service is always top notch and the food is excellent! It has never disappointed."}
{"text":"Fabulous ambience amazing service and tasteful food. One of my favorite spots from now on"}
{"text":"Food, service, ambiance is worthy of the 5 stars. All the staff is outstanding and the food makes the whole experience fantastic. Little gem don't say it out loud cause it will get crowded.
Carlos was our server and he is professional, pleasant and makes you feel comfortable. Wife had Seafood linguini and she said it was exceptional. I had the bifteak (steak) it was good. Next time I'm trying the lamb."}
{"text":"A delightful Italian restaurant tucked away in the back, with ample off street parking . The greeting I received was warm and friendly, and I was seated in the sun room by the window. My server, Carlos, guided me through the evening specials, and I settled on the risotto with smoked tuna. Oh my, was it ever good! The bread was very fresh and a nice accompaniment with the meal. I never felt rushed, and Carlos always seemed to know when to check in."}
{"text":"My family has been here many-a-times for special occasions and whatnot.  This is probably the best casual fine dining restaurant with decent prices, delicious food, and amazing service (usually).

Their Angel Hair paster in Velvet Lobster sauce is something everyone must try at least once!!!  It's my absolute favourite dish!!!

The only reason I give it only 4 out of 5 stars is because unfortunately being a small venue, they sometimes run out of certain wines and sparkling wines. And there is limited parking.  And only once have I had not so good service.  But still good service, just not as good as it's usual above-par exceptionally good service.

If you're in the area and want something special without breaking the bank, definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"We celebrate a lot of special occasions at Michael's Back Door.  Not only is the food fantastic, but the service is wonderful.  We took advantage of the Taste of Clarkson special which offered an appetizer, entr√©e and dessert for $25.  

I started with a zucchini and tomato salad.  The portion was larger than expected and presented beautifully.  Other members of my party enjoyed the Caesar salad and the butternut squash soup.  I've had the Caesar before and it's easily one of the best I've had.  Those who enjoyed the soup couldn't stop raving about it and the portion was gigantic for a soup.  After hearing our comments, the waiter told us about a group of guys who come for lunch.  They have such big appetites that they serve them 32 ounces of soup!

I chose the veal for my main course.  Again, the portion was very generous.  It was well-prepared (not overcooked) and topped with melted cheese over zucchini and eggplant.  Delicious!

Dessert was a fruity sherbet with pineapple.  Nothing special, but very refreshing after a big meal.

My only complaints are that they never seem to have the wine we want to order and the service can be slow at times.  To be fair to Michael's, they have always made a good wine suggestion for us and we were a large party.  

Michael's is on the pricy side, but well worth it.  Try to take advantage of their specials, like the Taste of Clarkson!

Also - I highly recommend the angelhair pasta with lobster sauce.  Huge portion and absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Finally decided to have a date night here after seeing the restaurant advertised numerous times - in hindsight we should have visited one of the many other highly rated Italian restaurants in the city.

Pros:
- The Lamb Ragout risotto was excellent
- The ambience was nice, staff other than our server seemed friendly

Cons:
- Our service was very poor. We initially thought our server was just a little quirky but as we got further into our meal we realized he was just a bad server.
- My duck breast was served very well done, even though I ordered it medium rare (and the server even told me that the typical way it was served was medium rare). It came out grey and dry. Ten minutes after being served, the server walked past us and asked if everything was good and I told him that my duck was way too over cooked. His response: \"It's ok though right?\", and then he walked away. I've never experienced that kind of reaction when telling the server of a nice restaurant that my meal was not properly cooked.
- My wife ordered the cioppino, and almost all of the seafood was over cooked. Beautiful scallops, large shrimp, and a full squid - all ruined by cooking them until chewy. A real disappointment.


After the lamb risotto we had very high expectations for the main meal but unfortunately it was a total disappointment. Good service could have salvaged the meal but instead the service made it worse. We will not return."}
{"text":"I appreciate the opportunity to let everyone know I wouldn't even go back for a free bowl of soup.  We recently booked this restaurant for a family (40 people) celebration.
We required a receiving table for favours, homemade cookies and gifts for the occasion.  The 4' square table was hardly big enough.  The favours which I delivered earlier that day in a cardboard box, were left in the box on the table (I was 
so embarrassed)  and this table was placed, not at the entrance where one 'receives' their guests, but hidden away in a tight corner.  No room for the gifts, they ended up
on the floor.  When I spoke to the manager he fumbled his excuse that I should have
been more explicit.  My response was anger and that he is the professional and should
know better.  They had to go scrambling for a high chair we requested a month earlier.  We were so crowded that it was difficult for the waiters to serve and also for
our guests to mingle a bit.  It seemed like an evening of commotion.  They should not have taken our reservation. I would have respected them if they had just told us
they could not accommodate such a large group and our needs. They took the business, pack us like sardines, then handed us the bill.  Never, will I go back, let alone recommend this place.  Also, the food was good - not great, simply good."}
{"text":"The lobster pasta was by far the best dish I have ever had, it's been on the menu over 36 years! No better pasta than this place."}
{"text":"Let's just say I was super disappointed! My family and I went there as we were craving Italian and we looked on yelp to see which place had the highest ratings in mississauga and found this so we decided to give it a try. 

1) We felt like we were being discriminated because of our colour or maybe it's because it was the first time we went there and the other people were regulars? I really don't know. Either way we shouldn't have felt the way we did. The only friendly person there was the guy who was filling our water who happened to be Asian. 

2) my husband ordered a Caesar salad as his appetizer and they couldn't even use real shaved cheese and instead used powder cheese? It's not like this Resturant charges cheap prices either 

3) the server didn't have great customer service and was kind of rude. We would ask him questions as we have never been there before and he would sigh and answer them in a rude and unfriendly manner 

4) the only dish we liked out of the 5 we ordered was the crab pasta. The rest was lacking flavour and sauce. We wanted to ask for more sauce but our server was rude and we didn't want anyone to spit in our food. 

5the service was really slow. Food took a really long time to come out and even longer to get the bill. I get it, they were probably busy and under staffed but the bill shouldn't take that long. At that point we just wanted to get out as we did not have a good feel of environment while being there. We were extremely disappointed in what we went through considering this is ranked #1 in mississauga for Italian. I definitely would not recommend this place. I am still very puzzled why this place has such high reviews. I asked the rest of the people I was with that evening and they all felt the same"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my husband last night.  We were the first to arrive, and the waitress was very pleasant and accommodating.  It was cold outside and we were fortunate to be seated by the window and beside the baseboard heater.  Very comfortable.  The waitress explained the specials, and I had a prix fixe dinner (roast beef was excellent and vegetables nicely done).  Also had the three bean soup which was very tasty.  The only reason I didn't give a 5/5 was that my husband's salad (just a garden salad) was a bit \"old\"...however, the restaurant was very nice and didn't charge us for it.  Desert was an apple cake with a lemon glaze...very nice as well. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We came here for my dads birthday and for the Taste of Clarkson menu.  The service was very friendly and prompt and the main courses had unexpectedly large portions which we loved.  I had the cornish hen and the jus was absolutely delicious, hen was not overcooked or undercooked at all.  My sister and dads mushroom tortellini had AMAZING sauce and my mothers salmon wellington had really light fluffy pastry with a very yummy salmon centre.  The dessert was very good as well! We'll definitely come here again; well worth the price and thank you for the great experience :)"}
{"text":"We got to MBD for an annual event and I can summarize the food as 'Nursing Home Gourmet.'

The sad part is that the the owner is truly trying. Just not in the right ways.

Here's what I think can be improved:

-Our function is typically in the piano room which is 80s decor. It doesn't help quash the nursing home vibe. 
-Each year we are presented with the same prix fixe menu. I think it's time to get a new chef who is on top of contemporary food trends.
-For a group of between 30 and 40, there is usually only one server leading to long wait times (cold food from downstairs) and poor overall service.
-The server and bartenders clearly aren't motivated and are just weird. 

Michael, if you read this, please keep up the good effort and try to innovate on your prix fixe menus, update your decor, and hire some hip staff."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time because I saw an ad for the Taste of Clarkson which is happening until February 10, 2017.  Came here for dinner and it was very cozy and intimate.  The server was very friendly.  However, I cannot say that I was blown away.

First of all, take the name of the restaurant literally.  I came in through the big sign on top of the front door facing Lakeshore Blvd.  There was a party in a room that I peeked in and later found out was a private room.  I walked downstairs to a door leading to the outside.  I walked around outside trying to find another entrance.  It was very dark and damp that night and it was a bit weird walking around looking for the \"main entrance\" in the dark back alley/parking lot.

Anyways, so I found a sign, I entered the doorway.  I was led to a hallway, which again had private rooms and then the main room to the left.  It was hardly recognizable as the main entrance.  There was no host/hostess.

I saw the bar and asked if this was the main entrance.  Alas, so it was.  I was directed to my table.  I liked the cozy neighbourhood vibe.  Really great if you wish to have an extended conversation prior to the appetizer coming.  It took quite awhile to come.  Good thing there was bread you can dip in olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

The food was okay.  The mushroom bruschetta was fine, but even after the long wait for it, it wasn't magnificent.  Also had the ravioli with boar bacon.  This was great, I loved it, but the sauce was just a tad bit on the salty side.  The dessert, white chocolate tart was good.  The entire meal was good, however, not excellent.  The fact that the appetizers came so late and the maze I had to go through before I found the place contributed to the whole evening being just an okay evening out."}
{"text":"Our waiter Steve was hands down the best waiter I've ever had. Every recommendation was spot on and he did something really special with our dessert selection. It was our 3rd anniversary and everything about the meal was excellent. The sauces were savoury and the wild boar chops special was delightful, as was the Pollo dish with an amazing garlic tomato sauce. The house made semi-freddo and sticky toffee pudding desserts were superb. Portions were generous. We don't live closeby but can't wait to come back.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight for a work function of about 40 to 50 people.  They were short staffed because of the bad weather and we had 1 server and she was a rockstar! Way to go Angela! You would think that there were 3 of them there because she was so efficient!  Appetizer and entree was yummy! Had to take dessert to go since I was on call and had to leave. My second time there and I remember the food was also very good the first time.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was here for Valentines Day with my wife. And I must say we were treated like  royalty. Delicious food, nice live piano and experienced staff. I very much Recommend for any occasion."}
{"text":"WoW....WoW...WoW....did I say WoW ? 
This place is truley a hidden little gem in the heart of mississauaga!!
Upon entry we were a little skeptical, service was a little slow in seating us but worth the wait for sure !
Service itself was great ! 
Our waiter Sean was fantastic! Truley a nice guy and very knowledgeable with the food and wine !
The food ....oh man the food !!! 
The food is amazing!!! I ordered the lamb ...and I can honestly say I have never had a better rack of lamb anywhere period ! Definitely amazing ! Perfectly cooked and fresh ! 
My friends got the Seafood risotto which isn't on the menu anymore but when we asked for it the chef apperently was excited to make it ! 
Also got the veal scalopini and wow so tender !

If you want a great Romantic evening with your 
Significant other , a place to treat your family, and

{"text":"We just went here tonight for my 25th birthday dinner. The restaurant has a huge parking space which can be very deceiving as it is behind the building but we easily found it. Upon entering we were quickly seated which was nice and there is a space to hang your jackets. After sitting down they served us some bread (enough for everyone to get one slice) along with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We ordered the bruschetta for an app. It was okay, the bread was toasted and tomatoes tossed with some seasoning but in my opinion it was missing some form of cheese and I put a little of the oil and balsamic dressing from the table on it which added more flavour. I was a bit scared about what I had gotten myself into after eating the bruschetta but my main was very good. I ate the Atlantic salmon and it didn't let me down at all. It came with rice and some fresh vegetables the fish had a really delicious bread crumb coating on the top. Unfortunately I was a little too full for dessert and we never mentioned it was my birthday so nothing further happened but it was a really nice evening with good friends. Just a note for the owners we sat in the back corner (which had a really beautiful set of windows and sky light all the way up to the third floor) and there were some pretty visible cob webs hanging from the ceiling. I mean this is a minor detail but something to be aware of. With that being said we would definitely go back!  Everyone enjoyed their food, my boyfriends pasta was also really good it was one of the daily specials ( crab linguine)"}
{"text":"We come to Michael's every once in a while after finding it in the Entertainment Book which they are no longer in. Two veal parmigiana's cost 45 bucks alone. If you can not looking to spend money I wouldn't recommend coming here.

We both ordered a soup, I had minestrone and it was delicious. I am very picky on minestrone soup because they all taste so different and I like the soup here. My boyfriend got the butternut squash and he loved it as well, it's funny how the table beside us who the waiter knew got double the size of butternut squash soup...

One of the pops came back as diet and the owner changed it, when the bill came the waiter argued with us that we had 3 pop and would not listen to us about one of the pop being diet and was changed.. He was too busy socializing with the table beside us...

The veal was good overall, the waiter Tony I wouldn't recommend as the service was horrible and he just stood beside us the whole time talking to be other table about Cuba and this and that... We had to argue with him about the bill and if he didn't remove the charge he wouldn't of got a tip.

I thought customers were always right?"}
{"text":"I planned our staff Christmas party here for 19 people. I made reservations a couple of months ago with an estimated guest count of up to 26. As the numbers decreased, they were very understanding and just requested that we give a final count a week before so they can allot the seating.

I was sent a variety of preset menus to choose from and we went with menu #3.....antipasto, pasta in tomato basil sauce, an option of beef, chicken or salmon as entree, and a choice of B-52 cheesecake or chocolate tartufo for dessert. I believe it was $49 or $50 pp for this menu......with the bread to start, we were all stuffed at the end of the meal. They were able to accommodate for the vegetarians and the vegan/gf guests.
For antipasto, they left off the meat and feta and gave beets, carrots, artichokes and some greens.
For the pasta dish, they made mine with gf corn pasta. This pasta was very bland and the chili oil wasn't very spicy.
For entree, everyone enjoyed their meal and the chef made a phenomenal dish for me: eggplant cooked to perfection....soft and melt in your mouth....with peppers, quinoa and tomato sauce. They did not have lentils but I was very happy with this meal.
For dessert I got a fresh fruit cup consisting of berries topped with orange slices.
We let the guests choose their drinks....wine, liquor, pop, tea and coffee. 
We did a gift exchange game during our meal and they were kind enough to set up a small table for the gifts and bring a garbage bag for the discarded wrapping. They never complained about our noise level or that we were in their way. The staff even took group photos for us!
The servers were were courteous and helpful.
The washrooms were small but clean. There is free parking in the lot behind the restaurant. They have a coat check area which is nice as the restaurant itself is \"cozy\" and dark. They did also have a private room with another party in it.
They did not even add the gratuity automatically for a party of our size and they allowed us to add what we wanted.
We were very happy with our experience here. Thank you Michael, Anthony, Shaun and your entire team."}
{"text":"Tip:  Free street parking after 5pm, Mon-Fri.  However, there is a large lot right behind MBD and the surrounding businesses.

5* service with 3-3.5* food.

I took a friend out for her bday and we did the \"Taste of Clarkson\" (set menu).  We had the Soup (Minestrone), Mushroom Bruschetta, Mushroom Ravioli, Salmon Wellington, White Chocolate Tart, & Creme Caramel.

Minestrone - Tasted like a vegetable soup, a good vegetable soup, but just veggies nonetheless.  No taste of any bacon, no pasta, no parm.  Lacked depth.

Mushroom Bruschetta - I would've preferred this over the soup as it had a good flavour.  However, I wish they had another App option as they already bring the same kinda bread to the table.  Maybe some olives or bread sticks would've been better?

Mains of BOTH Ravioli & Salmon were on the bland side.  Needed salt.  I asked my friend, who had the salmon & is a great cook, what she thought, and she said that she wished they'd used more herbs on the salmon.  And I couldn't agree more 'cause it was on the fishy side.  Again, salt would've been a good start!

Out of the 2 desserts, Creme Caramel was definitely better than the White Chocolate Tart.

I can't say enough about the service by host and Carlos (server).  They were attentive enough, friendly, and unpretentious.  It did feel like a little family.  

Prices weren't that $$$, so I'd consider going back, but I know that there are better fine dining options in the area.

As per the other reviews, the layout is a bit odd.  The main restaurant is on the basement level, spread across 2 different sections.  Restrooms, seemed shared with other units, are actually outside the unit itself.  And then there's the Piano Room (a private dining rm??) on the upper level.  If you have mobility issues, as many Clarksonites may have, consider parking around back for direct access and no stairs!"}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden little gem in the heart of Mississauga!! Great food and very cosy ambience. Ideal place for a date night."}
{"text":"Truly just a 2 and 1/2 on a return visit last June. Michael's is not an inexpensive choice and as such it has be very consistent. In fact I ordered the exact same dish I raved about in a previous review and was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's bridal shower. The dining area we sat in was spacious, accommodating, had a warm ambiance and was filled with natural light. I ordered a starter salad and tortellini, both of which were generous portions. The food was very yummy! Staff were attentive, coming around often to top off our glasses of wine and to ensure everything was to our liking. I would return when in the area."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary dinner. Excellent service, good atmosphere. We are both vegetarian and they did a great job catering for that. Only concern was a bit over priced. Other then that a good experience."}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to give this 4 stars. I really did. But unfortunately I cant. I met 3 friends for dinner last week for a birthday on good reviews from google & yelp. 

We ordered a bottle of wine (Cabernet Sauvignon- McMannis) which was very delicious!! (highly recommended) And for Appetizers we ordered the Bruschetta & the charcuterie board.

The Brushetta was fine-nothing special. Just garlicky tomatoes on 4 pieces of bread- honestly it was kind of boring.

The Charcuterie board was beautiful but it didn't have much on it! Like when I say it was a small board, I think between the 4 of us we each got one piece of dried/smoked meat, 2 olives, and a SMALL amount of cheese..pretty disappointing especially for an Italian restaurant. 

I ordered the Fish Cioppino for my main. For me although it was tasty, it didn't really seem like a coippino. A cioppino is supposed to have broth which this didn't- it just had tomato sauce. I would call it \"assorted fish with tomato sauce\". And only 2 small pieces of toast? What am I supposed to do with those? For $33 at least give me some real bread- not that crusty stuff that doesn't sop up broth (or lack thereof). There was lots of fish, just a serious lack of broth!! Stop smothering everything in tomato sauce-- 2 of the other meals that showed up were smothered as well.

For desert I had the Toblerone cake. Very good! I took a bite of it before taking a picture (whoops lol) and a Spanish Coffee.

To be honest, when I go to an expensive Italian place & have a full 3 course meal and come out saying the best item I had was Spanish Coffee...you know there's an issue.

So 3/5. Sorry Michaels. Its not like anything was bad. It just wasn't great. And for 4 people @ $330 before Tip, it should be great.

Maybe I'll try again one day!"}
{"text":"My partner wanted to try it out after we've seen tons of ads on insauga.com website. I wanted to go to Capra's Kitchen nearby (which I regret not going because of tonight's meal). 

We didn't know there was free parking behind it so we parked at the plaza across from it on the main lakeshore street. 

The atmosphere is quaint and it looks like a hidden gem to bring your date. 

Question: would I go back?? NO! Why? Read below..... 

Happy: Service was wonderful and the food came out quickly. There was bread, but it wasn't anything to remember by. 
My partner's farfalle pasta with shredded crab meat was hot and had good flavour to it. The portion is pretty good for $21.  No veggies were added. 

Unhappy: I ordered veal al limone with roasted potatoes and some veggies which were cold. The three pieces veal didn't appear fresh and wasn't the same temperature of hotness as my partner's dish. The sauce was sour so it was a turn off. I understand it's cooked with lemon BUT it tasted like bad meat gone wrong. I decided not to finish it to avoid stomach flu - in case. 
For $24, I'll rather get a simple noodle soup to fill me up. 

Definitely regret coming here. Not a happy feeling leaving the place. And it was a pricey dinner. 

Verdict:  we had to get bubble tea to cheer us up."}
{"text":"Michael's Back Door is my absolute favorite restaurant.  It's out of my price range so I only go there for special occasions.  My favorite waiter is Steve, friendliest waiter ever.  Very warm atmosphere.

Join their email list and you'll get an email for specials deals which I try to take advantage of.  Especially the Pasta Festival.  I LOVE pasta."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. After my first experience there, I was sad... because I didn't know about them sooner!

ATMOSPHERE: Sleek and comfortable setting. Great for dates, or meals for celebrations. Have been here to celebrate birthdays.

SERVICE: Fantastic service! Every time I've been here, service is always phenomenal. They really take care of you here. From the moment you step in the door, you are welcomed warmly. Service is never rushed, or careless. So lovely and attentive here to every part of the meal. Definitely rivals some of the fanciest restaurants in the big cities!

PRICE: Mid-to higher costs. Meant for a nice meal out, and special occasions. Totally worth it. Their seasonal prix fixe menus are fantastic, 3 courses for $39.99. Sign up for their emails for updates!

FOOD: So. Good. Everything there is very well cooked, prepared and presented. Great portions and flavours. From salad and soup, to pasta, seafood and steak, to dessert. It's all worth trying.

Highly recommend if you're looking for a nice place to dine in Mississauga!"}
