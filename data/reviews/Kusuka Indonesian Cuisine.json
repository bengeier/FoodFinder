{"text":"My first time trying Durian!!!  OMG!  Andrew Zimmerman is wrong about this fruit.  It is fantastic.  Be sure to tell them how spicy you like the rest of your food.  If you don't, you might get it Americanized and that's a bad thing. The two shrimp dishes we had were very good and the shrimp were not overcooked.  The eggplant dish was just ridiculously good. Everything my wife and I had was very good right down the peanuts with dried anchovy side dish I had. Strange but wonderful rice pudding. Hot tea we had was jasmine tea and was very good.   The best Chinese I've had in the area is not that much better than the worse.  This place is very different.   If you are looking for a bit of an adventure in food you must try this little place.  Be careful, you can drive right by this place and not see it.  It's almost right across from the Mitsubishi dealer on rt30."}
{"text":"Great experience first time eating Indonesian. No alcohol permitted. We were the only ones there and apparently a move closer to PGH is likely. Enjoyed the shrimp and tofu curry and the lamb skewers."}
{"text":"The service was great. Very friendly people. The food was delicious as well. I loved the chicken skewers as well as the mango smoothie. The location is a little far from downtown Pittsburgh but it's worth the drive. Restaurant is very clean. I enjoyed my dining experience there."}
{"text":"Service was good, portion sizes where good not too much not to little. The jasmine long grain rice with crispy onions on top was amazing. My favorite food we had today where the veggie spring rolls ! Green bubble tea is great. I tried the jack fruit and curry it was very good and spiced just right. Great experience over all we will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service. Came here with a group and ordered a wide variety of dished. Every single one of them was absolutely great. Zero atmosphere, and no alcohol allowed, but food is genuine and great which totally offsets that. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food is terrific; ignore the ambience. A group of foodie friends went on a field trip to the only Indonesian restaurant in the area.  They, of course, got carried away and ordered enough for a small army. Good thing the prices were staggeringly reasonable.  

The wait staff were attentive and the chef stopped by to check on us. The purists among us were delighted. Amateurs like me equally so.  There was a wide range of flavors. Spicy flavors also ranged from complex yet interesting to right on the edge.  In other words, terrific. Indonesian spices are deep and complex. Even the uber-foodie who can reverse engineer most dishes gave up because the blends worked so well. 

So if you are in easy range, lucky you.  If you are from the Oakland, East End, it is is worth the trip.  If you are an adventurous foodie, take a field trip. I liked the Gado Gado, Mei Goreng, Chicken Satay, Spicy Shrimp, a chicken dish and a beef dish whose names I forget.

Oh yes, it was their anniversary and we received free appetizers and left with a free box of good Jasmine tea.  Will be back.  Wish they were closer."}
{"text":"We went last night for the first time and were unimpressed. My wife's uncle is Indonesian (from Java) and has made some authentic dishes for family functions. He was very excited that a new restaurant opened up not far from where they live in Plum. We got there early on a Saturday and the restaurant was empty, the service definitely needs some improvement. Our server took a long time just to bring out waters and had to come back to let us know that some of the main ingredients used in some of their specialty dishes they had run out of (avocados, yellow rice?). 

My wife and I ordered the Shumai appetizer and were very happy with them when they came out. The peanut dipping sauce was thick and creamy! My wife had an Es Cendol as a beverage which was tasty but too rich for me. We weren't sure how large portions would be since the prices were so reasonable. Despite the fact that I'm a vegetarian my wife is a carnivore. More often than not she orders veggie options so we can sample each other's meals. We decided on 3 dishes, Gado-Gado, Gulai Daun Collard, and Terong Balado. 

The Gado Gado was by far the best of the 3 dishes, probably because of the peanut sauce! The dish came out slightly cold (the tofu). It wasn't terrible but we weren't impressed by the level of seasoning, it was pretty bland (other than the peanut sauce). The Gulai Daun Collards were watery,  and needed a lot of salt. The portion size of the dish was definitely reasonable but it was definitely lacking in flavor. The Terong Balado was by no means anything I would ever order again! It was extremely oily and bland.  Eggplant in general soaks up oil and this dish was mushy and tasteless. I had ordered the dish because we were expecting a bit of heat (the menu had 2 peppers next to it, the only dish that had that symbol), but it had no spice whatsoever.  I tried to doctor it up with hot sauce that came out in a ketchup/mustard bottle. No sambal? Really? The hot sauce was some generic brand that we're sure was definitely not Indonesian. 

The service was unbelievably slow and only once did they come by to refill water glasses. We contemplated dessert but opted instead to get something in the city that would satisfy our sweet tooth. We heard that they have different cooks and that is why the food is inconsistent.   I hope that's the case but I don't think we'll be venturing out to Irwin anytime soon as we have an authentic Indonesian restaurant at our uncle's house!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this weekend.  I ordered to go, but I can say the owners were very helpful and their service was good.  They helped describe some of the menu items, which was nice since I have 2 small children and didn't want to order anything too spicy for them, and I don't serve them chicken tenders and mac n cheese every meal.  One of their favorite types of food is Thai.  The food was very good and the prices were reasonable.  Only complaint I had was that one of the chicken dishes was very bland.  I can't remember name of dish, but it was basically just chicken in coconut milk, not very flavorful.  Everything else was really good.  I hope this place does well.  North Huntingdon needs places like this.  I ALWAYS prefer small, family owned businesses/restaurants over mega-chains.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Ordered the curry chicken, pendang beef, and chicken pan fried noodles. We expected the curry chicken to be the spiciest but the noodles and beef turned out to be spicier. All were very good. 

The staff is extremely friendly - so friendly, they have us complimentary meatball soups for our kids because they worried the dishes were too spicy for them. 

I recommend this for a nice change of pace from standard Chinese food."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place is here.  I finally found time to try it tonight, and it's nothing short of a miracle.  Located in an unassuming location in a strip mall along route 30, I sort of figured I would end up getting Indonesian-influenced Chinese cuisine.  Instead, I found the real deal.  I've only tried a few of the things on the menu - the salted fish rice, with bits of preserved fish - was pleasantly spicy, and the curried collard greens were awesome.  But I'm planning on going back to try the rest of the menu as soon as I can.

It's rare to see a family-owned restaurant in this particular neighborhood, so I hope Kusuka finds some of the respect and regular customers that they deserve."}
{"text":"My rate for this restaurant is 8 out of 10.  I ordered gudeg,  empal,  ayam kalasan,  and ketoprak.  Overall need some \"kick\" for the taste, but close enough to fulfill my hometown food cravings."}
{"text":"So, i got takeout from Kusuka Indo Cuisine for a quick dinner last night. I was pleasently suprised by the deep rich aroma of the store as I entered. It was Buffet night so there were plenty of prepared dishes out for the guests. I ordered Chicken Fried Rice Java Style, Lamb skewers, and crispy Spring rolls (2). After ordering I was presented the takeout within 20 Mins. my drive is only 8 mins from Kusuka so my meal was nice and hot on arrival home. My wife devoured the Spring roll as did I. they were nice and crispy and fried at just the right temp so as to leave the shell crispy but  not falling apart when you bite it. Good Sign. Next we split the rice and skewers . The rice had a nice flavor but was slightly saltier than we would have liked. I enjoyed the fried egg on top but wish it was a little less done (over medium instead of over well) so there was more yolk to enjoy. the Skewers were cooked to perfection and juicy. the marinade was well put together and spice combination was superb. My wife was raving about these lamb skewers, she has not tried many lamb dishes that she enjoys. to say the least I was very pleased with this result and will be back to try more Indonesian delicacies at Kusuka. 


My ratings on a scale of 1-5, one being poor 5 being superb. 

Price  5/5
The pricing is perfect for the market maybe even below for the quality provided. 
Presentation 3.8/5 
the atmosphere of Kusuka is minimalist at best, go for the food not the dining experience. BTW No Alcohol on premises. 
Taste/Quality 3.8/5
Only reason not 5/5 is for the salty rice and the egg. 
Overall Experience 4/5
Kusuka is a welcome addition to a sparse dining scene in western Westmoreland county. I will def Be back and cant wait to try some of the poultry dishes!"}
