{"text":"Bon sans réinventer le genre. J'ai trouvé l'endroit trop bruyant et le décor hideux.   J'y retournerais pour un 5 à 7 avec des amis mais j'éviterais d'y aller en amoureux."}
{"text":"When a customer suggested \"BBQ\" for lunch, I was a little skeptical.   I have lived and traveled in the SE U.S., which prides itself on BBQ.   Western North Carolina vs Eastern North Carolina vs Memphis vs Texas Brisket; however, this place had the best smoked BBQ that I have ever tasted.  Shocked...and delighted.   If I'm anywhere near Montreal on future trips, then this place is on my \"must do\" list."}
{"text":"A real local hangout - the place was packed full on a Thursday evening. We came here all the way from Montreal based on David W's review (#yolo). Seriously, Yelp needs to up its game in Québec, because places like this one aren't getting the attention they deserve.  The pulled pork sandwich had a generous amount of meat. The 12-hour smoking process did indeed liberate a good amount of smoky aroma and make the pork somewhat tender. It's lighter on the sauce and heavier on the smoke than any other pulled pork I tried which gave a more authentic impression. Amazing coleslaw - wished I had more. Fries are the soft kind, very lightly salted. The \"spicy\" mayo (some kind of very salty habanero with hot sauce) was not that good.  Being a smokehouse it's obviously not cheap. The pulled pork sandwich with fries was a good value at $20 + tip. A pint of Fin du Monde $10 + tip. Steaks are in the $30+ range but seeing the impressive meat ageing cabinet by the entrance, I might go back to try one. If you're passing by Chambly and are in the mood for smoky meat, this is the place to be. For parking, there's a lot on rue Ostiguy across from Bedondaine & Bedons Ronds (also a place to check out)."}
{"text":"Big steakhouse prices without the skill to back it up. The evening was a series of disappointments. First, one of the oysters tasted off. Then, they didn't warn my daughter that her plate was hot, so she promptly burned her finger. I ordered the côte de boeuf au jus, and for $50, I expected it to be excellent, but it was not as tender as it should have been, and the jus tasted like onion soup mix. The roasted vegetables were undercooked. My glass of wine had sediment at the bottom. Did they serve me the end of the bottle?  On the plus side, the kids' menu is well priced, and our waitress was nice, although I kept getting the impression that she was rushing us through dinner. We've been here a few times in the past, but this will probably be our last."}
{"text":"L'accueil et le service près du bar est très efficaces. Les serveuses n'ont pas la langue dans leur poches et sera vous répondre efficacement sinon répondra a vos niaiseries sur le même ton! Toujours avec une attitude professionnel. La musiques est bonne."}
{"text":"Yeah there was duck! I went to La Cochonne rit on a week day lunch. There was people but it wasn't packed so it was quick and nice. I ordered the duck club sandwich, I though: duck in a club, this should be the new standard. It was good but a bit blend however. My boyfriend took the tacos which were also nice. The service was effective and cheerful but the food was ordinary."}
{"text":"L'endroit est chouette ! La décoration sympa  La carte est vaste, le choix est appréciable. Ce sont des plats traditionnels, de bistrot. Mais les prix sont vraiment trop élevés pour ce qui est proposé. Les plats ne sont pas extraordinaires non plus. C'était une bonne soirée, mais pour cette raison je n'y reviendrai pas.  Je n'ai pas également pas apprécié le fait que les serveuses parlent avec médisance d'autres clients, sans discrétion."}
{"text":"Excellente bouffe bistro... mais assez cher pour le genre. Belle qualité de nourriture. On aimerait de vraies bières de micro-brasserie pour aller avec ces délicieux burgers..."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Chambly. What I love about La Cochonne Rit is that they have a pretty wide selection of food from pub fare to higher end steaks, which makes it a perfect local restaurant. You have a simple, affordable and delicious gourmet hamburger at 14$, you can have it. Prefer the 100$ tomahawk steak, you can have that too. Or anything in between.  As I live in Chambly, I've been to this restaurant numerous times ever since it opened. What I find is that they always delivered a consistent experience in terms of food quality, service and atmosphere.  They also have a good selection of cocktails. I must admit I have a weakness for their homemade lemonade & bourbon. Perfect in the hot summer days.  If you're in the area, definitely stop by La Cochonne Rit. But you may want to check and book a table in advance, they are pretty popular around here :)"}
