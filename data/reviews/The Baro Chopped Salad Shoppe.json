{"text":"If Toronto had a Chopped franchise his would be it. Baro has fresh and tasty salads.  I had the Avotaco and wish they had a mega size option.  I'll definitely be returning for more."}
{"text":"I came in around 12pm, and I did not have to wait long to get my salad chopped. Staff is polite and patient. Food is healthy and very tasty. I really liked my avotaco salad."}
{"text":"People of Toronto and Queen West. Why is there not a lineup out the door at the Baro? I mean if you eat salads this is where you should be at. I wish I could make my homemade kale ceaser taste like this. Ingredients are super fresh. Love the selection of combination toppings. You can always make your own too or select a pre made one. Chipped the way you like it in front of ya. Yums. Get in my tummy."}
{"text":"Ordered two salads last night through Foodora and I did not expect such a sad looking meal to arrive at my door. SOOO overpriced for what it is and it doesn't even look appetizing. I don't know where these other people got their salads from in the photos but mine looked nothing like that. The portion was small and for an extra 3 dollars for chicken I should've been able to spot the chicken but my boyfriend and I had to dig around and find some small pieces here and there. Not worth your money. They shouldn't specialize in salads. The dressings were bland too so we had to use our own dressing in our fridge.   Would never order again."}
{"text":"Had a great quick lunch at the Baro. The salad bar was clean, the ingredients were fresh, and the owners were incredibly friendly.  I ordered the Tex-Mex salad but the Cobb salad looked great too. They were happy to do substitutions. You can also choose your own ingredients for a custom salad. Prices are reasonable for the area.   Would definitely return here for a quick, healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good. I mean, the salad I got wasn't bad in any way. But it was around $16 because I added chicken and bacon. Now, considering its on queen west, I get that it's going to be pricey. But if I'm paying that much for a salad the thing I didn't like is the restriction on the amount of ingredients allowed. You can pick 4 ingredients from one list and 1 \"premium\" ingredient. I ate my decent $16 salad and it was good enough. And if I were able to make the salad with all the ingredients they have I would have liked it quite a bit more. And maybe I would come back. But $16 for a mediocre salad with limited ingredients isn't great. It's a 3/5."}
{"text":"I tried the tofu'd kale salad with Greek yogurt and feta dressing and it was very dry and bland. When I opened it back at the office, I noticed that the small dressing container was only half full, not enough for all the kale. I felt like I had to ration it or I would not even be able to finish half the salad.   There was way too much kale, it felt like the salad was 90% kale (it came with assorted nuts, tofu chunks, beets, and pomegranate but the ratio is very off). It was my first time here and for $13.45 it was pretty disappointing and tasteless. The assorted nuts were the only redeeming points. My friend ordered an avotaco and had the dressing mixed in, she noted that it was also lacking dressing."}
{"text":"The Baro Chopped Salad Shoppe is a welcome addition to the Queen West strip. Located just west of Spadina, their customizable salad menu offers much healthier alternatives than some of their closest neighbours. Salads have the potential to be less appealing when choosing a meal on the go, at times (if for no other reason than the fact that it takes a lot of chewing and stirring to evenly distribute your favourite ingredients so that each bite is packed with flavour).  Baro has the solution: salads here are prepared step by step in a manner that makes them much easier to eat and digest, using an instrument called a mezzaluna. A rocking motion dices the leafy ingredients and any toppings into the perfect mixture of textures, meaning you won't have to douse your salad with dressing in order to enjoy it.  Pick from one of the featured classic salads: Avotaco, Cobby Blues, Greek Freak, Kale Caesar, or Salad Ni√ßoise. Not enough options for you? There are 4 more options on 'The Artisans' menu, which includes Hemp & Tabouli. Better yet, customize you're own for just $8.90. First, you may choose two greens for your base. After that, you're allowed to pick up to 4 toppings from 'A' and another 4 from the 'B' list, and one premium topping. Any extras can be added for an additional cost.  It's clean and spacious in here, with a streamlined system of ordering and preparation of your meal. The staff are very polite and will assist you in creating a satisfying custom salad if it's your first time. Seating is limited, but the decor is modern and appealing. Not everyone will catch onto this craze, but I'm sure this place will be around for a good while."}
{"text":"I was so happy to have found this spot! After my spa day today, I was craving a salad. I got a salad that had lettuce, spinach, goat cheese, quinoa, apple and walnuts with strawberry dressing. It was fantastic. Fresh and local ingredients are extremely important to me. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"great food, fresh and tasty, up to expectations. have to deduct a star because it's a bit pricy but I'll definitely be back for more sooner or later :) wish they also had acai bowls!"}
{"text":"On Queen at Spadina, in the midst of a what is now a metric ton of quick serve restaurants.  Chopped salad - aka, all your ingredients are melded together and chopped into small bite sized pieces and tossed together, with the side benefit is that your dressing hits every bite too.  Baro prides itself on organic 'real' food ingredients.  $10 gets you into a 'classic' salad, which are the standard fare of stuff like Greek, Cobb, Caesar, etc.  $12-13 gets you into an 'artisanal' salad, which are what I like to call hipster salads that have fruits and other nuts in with the veggies.  $15 gets you into a 'dirty' salad, which are the 'unhealthy' options - namely a fried chicken salad, and a double cheeseburger salad.  I've had the 2 dirty salads and a Cobb from here. All 3 were very good. The double cheeseburger one in particular was oddly satisfying- good crunch from the lettuce and an awesome Russian dressing mixing with pickles and beef. Like a naked Big Mac.  The problem is the portion size. Even at the cheapest level, there just isn't enough food here to warrant a $10 price. Think 'side salad' at most restaurants- that's the portion we're talking about.  And the $15 salads are the same size. Good ingredients cost money, but this is a bit much.  Unfortunately, this is what's going to keep me from coming back here. Pricing should be topping out at $10 with these portions."}
