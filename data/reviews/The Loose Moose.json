{"text":"Yum! I made reservations for 5pm before the Leafs game on Sunday. We got a corner half boot/half table infront of a TV (hubby loves to be at a tv in a sports bar). They have a ton of beers on tap and they sell you samples for $1.77 which is cool, so you don't have to worry about not liking it if you really want to try all the flavours. My cousin got the first beer on the list, it was like a fruity pop type beer , which I liked because I am not a beer drinker. The nachos are not skimpy on the toppings, loved that! The wings came out with celery and carrots and ranch sauce (which may not seem like a big thing, but some places don't bother with those extras, which suck because you spend so much on wings!) My cousin had the black been and corn quesadilla , which to me seems to be lacking fillings, but she liked it, she's vegetarian..so at least she had options. Her BF got the avocado BLT type sandwich, looeds pretty big and yummy. Deffinately would come back for another pre-game, pre-concert, pre-event ( I go to the ACC a LOt!) drink!  All in all the best item, hands down, were the nachos. They layered the toppings and cheese (so you don't have a bunch of naked chips at the bottom), and were generous on the toppings, came out with salsa and sour cream (no extra charge for those)  OH! Forgot...Sundays are \"Cesar Sundays\" ..$3.00 dollars for my fave mixed drink..Cesars..normally $7.50. They have 3 to chose from, vodka, gin or tequila.  5 stars because it is an unintimidating sports bar/bar with reasonable prices, and good food, and the service was good too."}
{"text":"We were just here to watch the Raptors-Cavaliers game 1. It wasn't that busy yet and it was a solid hour before the game. We were seated at an awkwardly placed table and sat for half and hour without even being approached. We were literally ignored and invisible with plenty of waiters walking by us. We were about to spend a lot of money to watch the game, it was quite a shame. Even if they had the decency to serve me a glass of water I probably would've stayed. Not coming back. Poor service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food there... too bad that their service is consistently lacking. I've been there twice for a week day lunch when they are not too busy and the servers constantly disappear for long periods of time.  The server yesterday was not friendly at all, when we placed our orders she didn't even bother asking what we wanted as a side. I ordered the Pig and the Egg (very unhealthy but delicious), I asked for the avocado to NOT be fried and no american cheese, she said she could just ask for no avocado....well lady I DO want avocado just not fried!!! I also said I wanted the Ceasar salad as a side.  When the order came I had the wrong salad so I told the guy that brought it that I had actually ordered a Ceasar. When he took the salad the waitress came and I realized that my sandwich had american cheese when I specifically mentioned I didnt want any. She asked where my salad was and I said they brought the wrong one and that my sandwhich actually had the cheese I didnt ask for...Needless to say they took the sandwich and had to wait for a new one to be done.   It really upsets me that food has to be thrown away because servers are not paying attention when an order is made."}
{"text":"Great bar to watch a game, we stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for some American football. The hostess was less than friendly and seemed a bit irritated by our request to be placed on the waiting list at a table near a TV, so we just stayed at the bar and ate. Food was very good. Grilled chicken sandwhich, nachos, and tumbleweed burger The wings and sandwiches I saw come out nearby looked/smelled great as well. They had a very good craft beer list (best I've seen in my visits to Toronto so far). The vibe of the place is awesome, very cool layout with long tables for family style dining as well as great bar design to maximize the number of spots at the bar. Bartenders were very attentive and on top of drinks and food orders. Parking is a pain in the butt, but otherwise I'll definitely be back in subsequent trips to GTA."}
{"text":"I got drunk here last night. Thanks to the help of my friends, Growler 1, 2, and 3. I didn't even know these were a thing. More places need to invest in this glorious phenomenon, or maybe they do and I just live under the rock that is Newmarket.  The best part, was the gloriousness that it the Pig & the Egg. If I could make sweet, sweet love to one food for the rest of my life this would be it. Bacon focaccia, sausage patty, more bacon, pulled pork, the best runny fried egg, and some delicious fried avocado, with some cheesy, saucy goodness. It was everything I never knew I wanted.   Service was also quick and attentive. And the place was busy, which is always an awesome sign. I will continue coming back!"}
{"text":"Hit up the loose moose after a jays game this summer. Ordered the fish and chips and it was the bomb!  Nice light crust on the fish and the fries were cooked perfect, the  jalapeño butter milk coleslaw was awesome to!  Gotta love the beer selection to. New. go to place when visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Two floors in this place - it's a pretty big space.  This is from when I was upstairs.  They've revamped their beer menu at the beginning of February 2013 and now as of writing have technically the largest number of draft beer taps in Toronto  - half mainstream, half micro/locals and all available in a taster/small size as well. Pretty nice, but the problem is that the staff don't know what they've got so they would get the wrong item constantly.  This isn't a sports bar - while they've got some TVs, the music plays on.  Place was loud, and when the cover band started up downstairs (during the Leafs game) the place started to empty out fast.  I wouldn't expect this to be a go to/busy place after 10pm normally.  Lots of large tables, so groups of any size should be accommodated easily.  Food was American chain style, executed well, but misses the individuality of a local restaurant.  Is it a destination place? No, but you'll probably start here when you're doing a party night with 10+ people, or your office is having an outing."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Overpriced average food, rude wait staff, and hot and loud inside for lunch. Bad vibe right off the bat when the girl hostess tried to get us to sit at the bar for lunch - it was like arguing with her that we wanted a table! The girls look and dress like a strip club. Our waitresses skirt was so short - maybe that's the look they want, but if they insist on hiring hot chicks, make them better servers! Guys will like this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place- went back a second time. The decor and atmosphere are great and they have great prices. I really enjoyed that they had samplers for their beers at $1.50 or lower. As a tourist, this is entirely helpful- although I found Canadian beer in general to be too bitter.    The food was great and of the 4 poutines I tried, they had the best. The servers are attentative and friendly as well.   The Loose Moose is best for its beer selections if that's what you're looking for in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"zur em haben sie hier sogar die deutschlandspiele gezeigt. es gibt aber für eine sportsbar gar nicht so viele fernseher. die preise sind daran gerichtet, dass man sich direkt neben dem messezentrum befindet. aber das essen ist in ordnung."}
{"text":"The Loose Moose in Toronto liegt schräg gegenüber vom Hauptbahnhof (Union Station) im Financial District. Wie schon in einem anderen Beitrag erwähnt, ist die Decke, die mit unzähligen leeren Tequila- und Bierflaschen geschmückt ist besonders erwähnenswert. Die Karte bietet typisch amerikanisches Baressen. Nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Die Qualität unserer Gerichte war sehr gut und die Bedienung freundlich und zuvorkommend."}
{"text":"Good pub food. Nice atmosphere. At times when it gets busy they can get rude at the door, but other than that it's good."}
{"text":"We stopped in here while in Toronto visiting for the weekend (main reason my girlfriends birthday). We sat down stairs(Antler Room) and were seated promptly. We ordered beers and mixed drinks. Two whiskey sours with egg white which we were excited for, two Raspberry lemonaids and a Heinekin. The whiskey sours were watery in taste, the raspberry lemonaids where extremely sweet and the beer was flat. The beer and whiskey sours were returned for a water and two margaritas which were ok. Food: My girlfriend and I split chicken nachos, one ordered the chicken avocado club, one had the woody burger and one had the chicken and goat cheese sandwich. The nachos were fair and kind of tasted like buttery popcorn, the chicken and goat cheese didnt have much chicken and the other two I hear were good."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time about a week ago and I wasn't very impressed with the food. The menu is typical pub fare, but not done very well. It was pretty pricy considering the poor quality of food and the portions.   To start we had the calamari ($9.99). The portion was very small and the calamari itself was just ok. The mustard aioli it was served with was absolutely delicious though.  For my main I had the wedge steak salad ($13.99). The steak was tender and cooked well, however the salad lacked dressing and the toppings (applewood smoked bacon, croutons, and cherry tomatos) were almost non-existant. It was definitely one of the worst salads I've ever had.  My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips ($12.99). The batter was fairly dark and at least a half an inch thick on all sides. When he got towards the middle of the fish he noticed that it wasn't quite cooked all the way through. The haddock fillets were obviously frozen and not fresh.  If you're looking for a great place to eat, I'd definitely skip this place and try one of the many surrounding restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Service is a bit slow.  Massive list of drought beer to choose from. The French onion poutine is a must try and the cheesecake."}
{"text":"I'm not sure who owns the Loose Moose, but it's been an institution for as long as I can remember. I've always known it to be the place to go before or after the game. I would always assume that it would have been the place to go to watch the game as well. I was disappointed to learn that everyone in Jays jerseys and hats that came to the bar couldn't listen to the game due to a \"company playlist\". In closing, I feel that there are so many options for places to go and eat and hang out in Toronto. In order to bring people in, you need to have a point of difference. Sure, they have the most extensive beer list in the city (nobody cares). We know what we like and want. The food is not great. Not terrible, but nothing special. If you want a point of difference, market yourself as the sports bar everyone expects you to be. You're past the point of being anything else."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great. It's kind of dark with interesting decor and a great table layout. They have a long list of beer available on tap, which is great. I had a burger and fries, which was great. Fries were extra great and reminded me of In-N-Out, although they weren't a replica. Prices are very fair. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Well, first of all, you'd never know this is the same Moose space. Gone are the drab dark surroundings, and in are eclectic and Canadiana aesthetic. There are hockey skates, bowling balls, boxing gloves- tons of items I have little experience with myself, but I can appreciate their appropriateness here. There are long communal tables, mismatched chairs, exposed piping on the ceiling, and bare-filament light fixtures.  Obviously, there are an abundance of flat screen televisions lining the walls, but they're not as intrusive as I'm seen in other sports-bar destinations. Here, it seemed to me that most groups in the room were simultaneously engaged in conversation, eating, and drinking, while keeping an eye on the score. The vibe is casual, young and buzzing with energy - especially on that Saturday night when the Leafs were playing the Habs. There's no way around the noise level on a game night- partially from the volume of people, partially from the game on the screen, and largely from the cheering (or booing) when someone gets a score. I did have to strain myself just a bit to chat with my sister, but undoubtedly, no one goes to a sports bar expecting a quiet and private night out. Here, I actually liked that my neighbour struck up a friendly Habs- related conversation with my sister, and that we both joked about our failure to make a dent on our fried potato \"loaf\".  I liked the sense of friendly competition amongst the room when either team scored a goal. So even though I'm admittedly not \"into\" the whole sports scene going on around me, I can appreciate the vibe for what it is and for those who are (aka. Everyone else in the room).   Well, despite the massive turn out that night, service at LM was friendly and attentive.  The meal moved at an enjoyable pace without long lapses between dishes (we received our \"appetizers\" separately from our \"share plates\" as requested) and without any obvious pressure from our server to turn the table at the end of our meal.  Our server also removed one of the cocktails from the bill that we really did not enjoy without a prompt, which I definitely appreciated from a customer service perspective. Speaking of cocktails, one of the main revisions with the LM overhaul was enhancing and improving the booze offerings. For beer drinkers (which is clearly their demographic here), there's 27 bottles and 54 draught beer options to choose from- the largest beer draught selection in the downtown core!  Go for your tried and true Canadian or Coors, or try one of the unique craft varieties like Sawdust City Gateway Kolsch (try saying that 10 times fast) and Lake of Bays Crosswind Pale Ale. And with all of those exciting choices, it's easily to be undecisive, but that's exactly the purpose of LM's 3-oz sampler pours ($1.11-1.33). For those of us (um, me) who are not so enthusiastic on the beer front, there is also a small list of VQA & International wine (4 red, 4 white), 7 cocktails (including a few with beer), and 3 different varieties of Caesars.  Caesars are my go-to drink, so obviously I was going there first. Over the course of the night we sampled:  The Caesar & The Snapper (Clamato, Spices, Extreme Bean with Vodka and Gin, respectively, $7.50)   Randypandyshandy (Leifmans Fruit Beer, Gordans Gin, Lime, Simple Syrup, $8)   Big Booty (Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Lychee, Passion Fruit, Vanilla Sugar, Ginger Beer, $12)   Stormy Weather (Rum, Pineapple, Orange, Granadine, Sirop D'Orgeat, Bitters, $9)   Beaus Pale Ale ($6.42 for a Pint)   Black Oak Nut Brown Ale ($1.11 for 3 oz) The Caesar and Snapper were standard Caesars 101- no bacon rim or smoke infused vodka or fancy pants garnish. But I don't necessarily need bells and whistles when they're pretty much exactly how I like them. I would definitely return for Caesars on Sundays when they're only $3 each! In contrast, the Randy et al., as I will call it, and the Stormy Weather, were definitely not our style. The former tasted a bit like a sweet candy had melted in light beer, and the latter, while certainly better, was still a little too sweet and flat. Thankfully, we both loved the Big Booty (we each got one) as it had a nice balance of sweet, sour, and a little peppery on the tongue from the ginger beer. I didn't even taste the beers myself, but my sister seemed to enjoy them.  While the old-LM was always a decent place for beer, their previous food offerings read more like a food \"program\" (aka. sustenance to soak up the booze required to get through a typical Jays game) than what Matt \"Rosie\" Rosen (Four, Reds) is offering today. With dish descriptions spanning Asia (Pork Belly & Ginger Slaw), Mexico (Tacos & Quesadillas), American (Fried Chicken), Italian (Meatball & Basil Bocconcini), and of course, Canada (Bacon and Bison Meatloaf), it's clearly an international spread...."}
{"text":"Nice American bar with lots of sports on many TV's. Waitress is friendly, although wifi-password came late (we already had other connection). Food (salad with popcorn shrimps) was good.  For a good lunch this could be your place."}
{"text":"Went to the Toronto Comic Con with friends and decided to stop at the at The Loose Moose for a quick bite. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very good and it does get busy so if you have to wait to get served to a table, don't worry, they are not ignoring you, the waitress are very nice and welcoming (trust me, I'm not trying to play nice because they are female or whatever, I am being plain honest). Now to the most important part, the food and drink. They have an alcohol menu, lots of option and they are definitely not on the cheap side. But it's downtown Toronto, don't expect too much for cheap alternatives to drinks unless you are getting carbonated drinks. The food menu is pretty decent, not overly too much option of food because generally it would be too hard to decide and I believe when there is too much options, quality of food decreases (not scientifically proven, but hey, that's just my two cents). I ordered the chicken avocado club, one of the sandwiches available. Just reading it from the menu sounds delicious: seasoned chicken, avocado, smoked bacon, etc.... (Don't remember all the stuff in the sandwich), so that's why I got it. It takes a while for the food to come, but it's understandable because it's busy and its downtown Toronto. Presentation wise is pretty good, taste very well, it's stuffed with lots of the things mentioned on the menu, but the most important is not too salty. Personally, I find that sandwiches, restaurant put a lot of salt on them and kills the sandwich. The fries are just like any regular fries you will find in a bar and grill place. Overall, I would rate this restaurant better than the other chains like Jack Astor, etc..."}
{"text":"I caught up with friends at the Loose Moose.  It is a typical sports bar featuring beer, food and lots of hockey.  Since I happened to be there during a Saturday night, everyone was paying attention to the Leafs game and the bar even had an MC to announce events or happenings or somesuch.  I didn't get to have any food, as we decided to go to another bar afterwards, but I did get to enjoy part of a pitcher of Labatt Blue."}
{"text":"Loved the fish tacos!!  I never usually order fish tacos but was recommended to try them by my friend. And they were GREAT! Not sure what the sauce was but it was a great flavor, with just enough spice.  Will definitely order them again!"}
{"text":"I've been many times and I have only ever ordered one thing: Dirty Bird. So it's not Loose Moose getting 5 stars, it's the Dirty Bird! My go-to for fried chicken. Huge serving, amazingly delicious batter and very little grease."}
{"text":"Did not have a chance to eat here but we did sample some beer from the huge assortment of choices. the bartender was incredibly knowledgeable  (I wish I could remember his name to give him props) and knew exactly what we were looking for and then some !!  I will also add that if there is a live band, do not expect to have a conversation with anybody near you... Fun place if you are in the financial district."}
{"text":"Don't bother coming here unless you like being ignored!  The service was horrible...we sat down at the bar hoping to have a few beers before returning to our hotel. We sat down right in front of a bartender who was conversing with two other patrons about a sports game on the TV (which was clearly more important to him!)  He looked over his shoulder, turned back around, and kept talking. Finally after about 5 minutes he turned around again, threw us a couple of menus, then disappeared. We waited for just over 20 minutes, never to see him again, before we had enough and just got up and left.  I'm not sure who thinks this is a good way to run a restaurant, but clearly they don't get it here."}
{"text":"Dark and loud, not a fan, but it's still a decent place to have a drink with friends after work. More importantly, plenty of spaces so we don't have to squish with ppl. Liked their ham nacho, cheap and tasty. Tried \"It's a Sin\", it was okay but I found their cocktail price a bit high. Beer seems ok, lots of options, and cheaper, gonna try it next time."}
{"text":"Colossal rip-off. I had a tiny and very average grilled cheese sandwich and a small bowl of not-hot-enough tomato soup for $17. That's it - no other sides. Don't go unless the convenience factor wins out over good value."}
{"text":"Food and service was not great. Ordered chicken sandwich with modifications and kitchen did not follow instructions. When server saw error, he shrugged his shoulders and said \"he told them.\" No apologies. Waited quite a long time for check which he messed up."}
{"text":"Went up to Toronto for the Memorial Day weekend and too catch a Blue Jays game. Stopped in on the Loose Moose for an late lunch/early dinner. Place had a good crowd for a Thursday, but still plenty of tables to sit. Food and service were good; prices too. Wound up coming back for a quick lunch before our flight back to NYC. oh...and the Jays won!"}
{"text":"Good selection of beer, yummy appetizers but the portions are small. Tonnes of flatscreen tvs make this definitely a sports bar,  not a cozy location by far. Didn't try the mains yet."}
{"text":"Pretty poor bar service, good selection of craft brews but service was seriously lacking"}
{"text":"Cool decor. Very b ig place.... Decent beer selection, typical bar food and very nice staff. Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"Convenient location if you are around the Union Station area with food and beer options at a fairly good price point. The place is always filled during dinner and happy hours, so either make a reservation or be prepared to wait.  I love the beer sample options that this place offers. It's about $1.50 per sample and I always get about 6 samples to try out. At times though, they run out of quite of number of beers really limits the options. The food is your typical pub food options and portions are fairly generous. My favourite is actually their beer battered fries and yam fries.   Some of the servers could be a little friendlier especially when the restaurant is located in the heart of downtown where service is always the main focus."}
{"text":"Expensive, loud, too busy.  They have an extensive craft beer menu, but the bartenders are not educated in what any of them actually taste like. Rubbish service altogether really and overpriced drinks.  Toilets are pretty skanky compared to the rest of the bar."}
{"text":"Went there today for the first ... Well for the first time since I have been living in Canada I did NOT give a tip.  The place looks cool however service was bad and food just ok.  First they forgot about the drinks and we had to remind the server.  Secondly, when the food came it took forever to get the cutlery   Thirdly part of the food was missing   Last but not least the food was not good except for the garlic fries. They were awesome. The table next to us did complain about the Caesar salad as well.  Too bad..."}
{"text":"saw this place, since in Canada, why not.. something new: place looks inviting.. little did i know or some reviews.. this place is split in two.. up stairs and down stairs.. down stairs is known as \"The Antler Room\" which is the same as up stairs (food/beer/music/ect).  -lots of beers to choose from -good music -lighting in area, is medium, but dependa where you wanna seat -pro: best beer i have ever ever ever had, recommened by server \" The Steam Whistle Beer\" OMG!!! -friendly servers, but the service to get a refill on ancoke/beer takes alittle longer..  -cons: fore me was the cold tortillas that comes with the fish tacos, thats just its made, but me being a latino, rhe tortilla needa to be fried in oil alittle this fish taco would be the bomb. -would come here again, try something new, but this beer (steam whistle, oooohhhbyeaaaa)."}
{"text":"Came here after a long day at a conference at the convention center on the way to a Blue Jays game. Our server was excellent, he recognized we were tourists and brought us a flight of Canadian beers. Atmosphere before a Blue Jays game was electric as eager ball park goers were pregame drinking at this spot.  First poutine experience was amazing a must get! Only complaint is my burger was well done - not sure if this is Canada thing?"}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!   Honestly, I have little idea what the Loose Moose is actually like because I don't think I've ever been that sober when I was there. This is a bar for drinking. Before the game, after the game, during the... you get the idea.  There's no gimmick at this place. It's a large, large, large, space which serves beer and wings and shows whatever sport you're looking for. They did a nice job of setting up a table for 10+ in front of a screen once during an NFL playoff game, so they get a star for that. They've accommodated large parties downstairs for birthdays, so kudos deserved as well. The waitresses wear dated sexy outfits, but they're not all that friendly - probably because of the typical clientele. This place serves its purpose, and it does a good job of it. Nice location, too.  3 stars"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a drink and something to snack on while walking around downtown Toronto. Place was packed, for good reason. Great bar, lots of beer on tap and food menu was diverse. Our bartender Dan was exceptionally friendly and service was spot on. Had a blast and felt welcomed and right at home. The fish tacos were incredible!!!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place and the menu hit the marks for our 13 yrs old girls (grilled mac&cheese). We were served a basket of maple bacon donuts upon sitting that were a surprising unforgettable treat. The loaded poutine more than satisfied our tastes and exceeded our expectations for our first try. The grilled mac&cheese was an excellent variation on 2 classics. The Buffalo chicken and waffles and the Best of the Wurst was outstanding."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite and some drinks before a hockey game and let me tell you, this place gets busy!  We weren't able to get a table so we managed to squeeze in at the bar.  The 2 cheeseburgers we ordered took over 30 minutes but we were well entertained with the bartender.  He was larger than most men so I don't think we were going to be making a fuss about anything!  Job well done though as he was hilarious and kept us laughing as we waited.   Greg T."}
{"text":"Not sure what this place is trying to be... Well I guess they are accommodating to a broader clientele. The draft list is great with lots of craft beer. Although don't ask for a recommendation from the staff as they have zero knowledge when it comes to the craft beer. I had decent service here when it was quite but if you ever go when it's busy, be prepared to wait. The staff always seem overwhelmed when its busy and service goes way down. Other than that, if you want a bar with good food and beer, check it out. If you are looking for a better beer bar, walk the extra couple blocks to Cest What"}
{"text":"I used to come here almost every Friday after work, however the place has really gone downhill since they did their renovations. Their new food menu (which tries to be unique) is lousy. I had their fries and sweet potatoe dish - it literally had the shape of the deep fryer it came out of it, was full of grease and gave me horrible stomach pains. A lot of the tables are now lumped together in long benches, so you could end up sitting with another group of people (which feels incredibly cramped).  The beer menu is nice, but if I'm going for beer selection, I'll go to the amsterdam brewery or bier mrkt. They should stick with cheap beer, fun atmosphere and simple pub food.  I miss the old loose moose."}
{"text":"If they ask you to sit at the bar and wait for a text to seat you at your table...you don't get a text. Worst service"}
{"text":"Went to their Antler room on a Saturday - well the pipes in the ceiling were leaky (so cover your beer glass to make sure sewage doesn't spill into your drink).... that is if you get a drink. The entire bar was packed and only 4 servers."}
{"text":"Large bar in the heart of the financial district, very close to major sport event locations, which explains why there are many BlueJays supporters. Good choice of drinks (although some brands were not served properly sometimes, like ciders with ice), nice choice of beers, with IPA on tap available, like the Boneshaker.  Food is typical bar food, nothing wrong but don't expect more.   Diverse selection of sitting, including many spots at the front bar, a few couches, some large dinner tables also.  It competes with the Jack Astors next to it, which has a patio but a very dull choice of beers compared to the Loose Moose. Service is overall equivalent in both, with some staffs friendlier that other as usual."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. The 'Smokey Bacon Burger' is in my top five burger ever. I like burgers. I eat a fair few. This is hands down awesome. Quite unexpectedly spicy but totally worth it."}
{"text":"The only consistent thing about the loose moose is the horrible customer service. The food is passable and the beer selection is decent, but where they really shine is the lack of customer skills in their servers. I have gone twice in the last four weeks and will not be going back. Fool me once..."}
{"text":"Since the The Loose Moose was near our hotel, we decided to down some beers here.  Not just for tourists going to and fro Rogers centre as many locals hang out here.  Sports bar with plenty of flat screens to catch all the action from the Blue Jays, Leafs, and Argonauts.  The Labatta Blue drafts were ice cold...nice!   Fries tasted like wet cardboard.  Burger was ok but nothing special.  If you're into a cool, spacious sports bar with huge beer selection, decent eye-candy female staff, and standard pub fare, then check out The Loose Moose."}
{"text":"+ Good beer selection  - Server was nowhere to be seen after first drink order - Uncomfortable high stools and rickety table = sloshed beer = sadness - No server in sight = no second beer  Didn't order food but looked overpriced. Tourist trap for sure.  To sum up: meh."}
{"text":"I applause the renovations! This place looks absolutely amazing from front to back!  The food however is a different story. The burger we ordered had about half a pound of processed cheese on it that made it almost impossible to eat. I probably would have had a heart attack before I was done.  From appetizers to last course, I didn't finish one thing.   Simplicity goes a long way! No point in drenching everything in sauces, ridiculous processed cheese, and  unnecessary ingredients."}
{"text":"Great lunch on a Saturday. Our server, Mary, was awesome. Attentive, talkative, helpful and fun. We had the guacamole and chips. Soooo good. And the salsa too. Then we shared the fish and beef tacos. Authentic tortillas and bursting with flavour. Royal City Smoke Honey was an excellent choice. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place since university, wait I lie I think I watched a UFC fight there about 4 years ago lol. Any hoot, it's walls are filled with memorabilia mostly boxing and other manly sports stuff... Considering I was with my Brother and Cousin I chose to have a pint. Hey at least they carry MillSt Organic (my fav). So the marketing totally got to me when it came time to order, looking at the coaster I was sucked in... TACOS! Fish Tacos to be exact! And I loved them! If your the type who thinks black pepper is hot, then I don't recommend you get these as there is a little kick to them. You get Three on a paddle and you know what they were just enough! I've had fish tacos at other places and they are usually a mess to eat but these were just perfect! Apart from the wait staff, not coming when you need them and coming when you don't I enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"While in town for work we stopped here for dinner and a drink. We were very happy with the service, atmosphere and food. This is a pub with a good selection of beers and a decent menu. It was busy, but not to the level at hurting the service. Our bartender Dan was attentive, interesting and friendly. Everyone from the staff to the customers seemed to be in a good mood and happy to be there.   Will definitely return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I came in here tonight to grab a bite to eat from a local place and I wish I never set foot in the door. If you are looking for a bar this place looks good but if you want a decent meal do not go here. This is the third place I've been to eat since I've been in this country can I have never received silverware before I got my food. Nothing like sitting there staring at your food while the wait person scrambles to find silverware.  I got the fish platter and it was served on a metal pan with a paper lining on top of it which made me wonder how sanitary that was to begin with. The coleslaw and fries were touching the metal pan and I questioned whether they have been properly cleaned or just repurposed between meals.   First bite was the coleslaw. It was actually pretty good with some dill in it. I was optimistic but that quickly changed when I tasted the tartar sauce. It was sour and bitter and the worst I have ever tasted. Not a good compliment for any fish.  The second bite was a piece of the fish. First thought was the fish was too thin( about a quarter of an inch thick) there was too much batter, it was salty and overcooked. I tried putting some malt vinegar on it but that didn't seem to help.  Waitress came by and asked me how was everything I told her it was very disappointing. She asked there was anything she could do to make it better and I said unfortunately there was not. I asked for some pepper for my fries to see if I could choke it down.  Came back a few minutes later and ask to take my plate away even though I was still working on my fries and I told her to go ahead before I make myself sick.  15 minutes later I've written this review I'm sitting at an empty table and I'm still waiting on my check.  I'm not sure if this is typical for this place but I won't be coming back to find out."}
{"text":"The beers were really good. The food was greasy as hell though. All in all, it was a good place and an enjoyable part of our vacation to Canada."}
{"text":"Really eclectic decor. A bit of a western feeling with the horizontal multi colored stained wooden plans matching the many old filament bulbs hanging from the ceiling. The ambiance is fantastic, though no patio unfortunately.  The food was equally as delicious and unique. I had a Tuna BLT with avocado-- it was perfectly seasoned.   Our server could've been a bit more attentive when we were ready to leave, it was a lunch shift and we had to get back to work.  Would definitely dine here again for great food, ambiance and draft selection as well."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a sports game! They have a projector screen at the back next to the big bench table. Grab a seat there and it's perfect angle to watch the game.   Good list of beer and cider. Lots of cider choices actually! And frulli is on the menu too for those gals who aren't too big on beer."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch while in Toronto recently. Weekday lunchtime wasn't crowded at all and the food was good and reasonably priced. Probably makes a great HH spot for locals."}
{"text":"The Loose Moose is located just a few blocks from the city's most well known landmark, The CN Tower. The bar offers a full menu, so it is popular with locals who work in the area for lunch breaks and after work drinks. Tourists also find comfort in the everybody's welcome here atmosphere. Considered the ultimate sports bar in Toronto, the Loose Moose also offers live musical entertainment. The bar staff are friendly and knowledgable. The burgers are great, and french fries can be substituted for a side caesar salad! Perhaps the coolest aspect of the bar are all the beer bottles on the ceiling! The atmosphere is fun and laidback, a great place to grab dinner or stay for a night of drinking as drinks are reasonably priced for a bar in a big city. Guys and gals alike will enjoy this establishment."}
{"text":"Went here for a small meeting the other night and we got a nice secluded area surround by brick walls. We asked for a \"less noisy\" part -we knew it was a bar and was going to be noisy but the server was great at placing us in a good spot.  We both ordered a caesar and shared \"crispy calamari\". It was delicious! It came with a cream sauce and was definitely one of the better calamari dishes I've tried. The caesar was pretty good as well. Prices were great as well!  The service was great, I can't remember out waitresses name but she was very sweet, smiled a lot and checked up on us minimally, I'm not a fan when waiters/waitresses constantly come to check in but she definitely knew when to come by.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite after being at Center Island all day. Since I have eaten at Jack Astors many times, we decided to go to the Loose Moose which is right next store. Lively pub style ambiance. I choose the Chicken & goat cheese sandwich. The sandwich was wonderful tender with lots of cheese,served with a side of fries, the gravey was on the side.My boyfriend had the half rack of ribs with spicy fries.The ribs were perfectly done with an fantasic bbq sauce. The portions were plenty, both of us left fries. 4 coors light and dinner was $70 before tax. We would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"I know its touristy and a tad pricey but I liked this place. Nice bar.   The beer list is extensive and features tons of craft beers and the server was attentive and very knowledgable and ended up recommending an offering from Great Lakes which was mighty tasty.   Four stars for the Big Bitchin Greens salad. Delicious. Reminded me of a crunchy, shredded salad with sprouts I had at Susur Lees restaurant a few years ago. I have heard mixed reviews about the food at the Moose but that salad is bang on.  Nice washrooms. A good place to watch the big game with a crowd."}
{"text":"I am enjoying a delicious lunch of dark beer and bbq ribs as a half rack. The meal was wonderful and portion size just right. Service was excellent and seems to be totally run and managed by women. I am not sure about the evening service staff. But delish!"}
{"text":"Absolutely appalled with service tonight. My wife and I arrived at around 7:00pm after a night out in Toronto. Not only was there a 45 minute wait, but the waitress was so rude, we left immediately. She acted as though she was in too much of a hurry to serve us, and wouldn't accept my wife's government official identification when we ordered drinks. Absolutely awful."}
{"text":"Nice pub for sports games! I had the Mac and cheese grilled cheese and it wasn't the best but I love the environment and the service was good!"}
{"text":"A friend and I went to the Loose Moose for the first time last night to watch the Leafs play off game. I was impressed with how much seating and space there was. We had to sit in the basement and share a table - but the table was very large so it wasn't a problem. There were lots of screens to watch the game and we had really great, fast and friendly service. Our server even remembered what kinds of beer we were drinking and the place was packed. This is a great place to go for a drink and to watch a sports event!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service and atmosphere was good, although getting our food took longer than expected (about 40 minutes). I ordered the classic burger. Very very very bland. And by bland, I mean cardboard between cardboard. So don't order the classic burger. The coke was tasty though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick Guinness. Was sent to downstairs bar by door-men and the tender didn't know how to pour that damn Guinness. Gave me this foamy mess in a giant beer stein. Whaaaat?? At least I met a nice couple visiting from Saskatoon."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews unless I have an exceptionally good - or bad - experience.  The Loose Moose was, in a word, TERRIBLE.  We were rushed the entire time by rude staff and ended up having our just-purchased (not even touched) drinks thrown out by the bartender the minute the restaurant closed, along with another table who had their pitcher of beer pushed at them and were told to hurry up.  No refund, no apology, just a whole lot of attitude and ignorance.  Three friends and I are in town for one night for a conference and went there because it's close to the hotel.  When we entered, I asked how long they were open; the hostess said another 45 minutes, until 1am.  She said the kitchen was closing, so I asked what else was close by.  She assured me it would be fine for us to come in, so we quickly sat and waited for the server.  He said the only thing they could make was nachos.  Okay, we'll have nachos.  The server took my friend's credit card to process the bill as soon as we were served our first round of drinks and ordered food.  All good so far.  The server then disappeared, never to return.  Apparently he was done for the night?  We waited and waited to order drinks, then flagged down a busboy, who said he would run back and get the server.  Our original server came back from wherever he had been and said he was done, we would have to order drinks from the bar.  Fair enough, we went to the bar, ordered fresh drinks and paid for them.  I asked the bartender if they had a smoking patio and he said no, you need to go out front, and hurry.  When we came back in at 10 minutes after 1, no one else had left the bar, everyone was still finishing their drinks, yet our entire table was cleared.  I went to the bar, where the three people behind the bar refused to acknowledge I was standing there.  I asked a female staff member about it, but she wasn't sure what had happened.  She went to the end of the bar to talk to the bartender and a few minutes later, they were still just ignoring us, standing there.  Obviously none of them wanted to explain why they had sold us drinks, taken payment for them, and then thrown them out minutes later.  The bartender continued to ignore me and pretend he hadn't been asked about our order, so when he came within earshot putting away the bar, I asked why he had cleared our table when I had explicitly told him we were just going out for a cigarette. He said we took too long.    Now, where I come from, restaurants and bars don't throw out customers' food and drinks the minute the doors close.  You allow people to finish what they have paid for.  You don't do last call at 12:50 and chuck out the drinks you sold 10 minutes ago at 1am.  Liquor laws in Ontario allow 30 minutes to finish beverages after closing, for a reason.  Most establishments don't expect people to chug their wine back so their staff can take off.  The bartender was ignorant and condescending, refusing to refund our bill or replace our beverages.  We got in a verbal argument and I called him a dick, so he called his manager on the phone.    After he hung up, he yelled at me for calling him a name (hey, if the shoe fits) and THEN he offered us free drinks if we would come back tomorrow (I'm guessing because the manager told him to).  Um, no thanks!  None of us will be here tomorrow.  It really sucks that the one night we all had to spend together was cut short by some unhappy clown who obviously shouldn't be in the *service* industry as it seems such an inconvenience to him.  If you don't like people, don't work in the service industry.  If you don't like working late, don't work in a bar.  Pretty simple.  Taking money and tips and then treating people like garbage, throwing out what you just sold them, is not acceptable."}
{"text":"First visit to the Moose and would not hesitate to return. It has all the right things going for it.  Not going to beat around the bush, my instant draw was to the name. I love this style of pub when they take a clever name and have some fun with it.  The theme, tables, setup and smart decor added to the experience.  In terms of service. Could not have asked for any better.  We were greeted immediately, sat at a table, and our server was there within a minute to take our drink order.  When it came to food we ordered some shareable items for the table including the sliders wings and garlic fries. The turn around on food was fantastic and we were eating shortly after we placed our order. Throughout the night, which turned into quite a long one, our server didn't miss a beat and we tipped accordingly in appreciation.  The food was delicious. Simple but the flavors were right where I needed them to be. The sliders were cooked to perfection.   If you are craft beer person.  They also catty a great selection on tap that would please any beer guru.  Can't wait to get back and see what else they have to offer. The Loose Moose was a win for me."}
{"text":"I think this is Canada's version of Hooters. I didn't think much of the name since, well we're in Canada, but then The servers are scantily dressed and flirty as fuuu so I put the name and the atmosphere together and now am thoroughly disturbed by a place Im now calling the 'loose moose-knuckle' The food is actually pretty good, and the drinks are good too. The place is huge and would be ideal to catch a game sometime, but the service was pretty slow.  TIL that the loose moose is not just a clever name."}
{"text":"I have always had good beer, good service , good food and a good time here.   Would go here over jack Astors 10/10 times."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with one of my buddies downtown during a weekday. Heard that the place had gone through some upgrades and wanted to check it out.  Large spacious place, not too many people (I would assume it gets a bigger crowd in the evening on weekends) - so we got served quite fast.   Menu looks very exotic with interesting entrees. I had the bacon and bison meatloaf - delicious! My friend enjoyed his meal as well (the sausage mix) - so both were really satisfied.  The biggest thing there - the beer menu. It has a LOT of craft beers and rare imports that I had a tough time picking one. The waiter himself had a bit of trouble knowing which one is what... but just picked a random one and was not disappointed. Truly impressive list!  Prices are decent given the size of the servings. Adding the beer moved the price up quite a bit but didn't feel a big pinch. Overall very pleasant experience"}
{"text":"Came in.. Sat down.. Waited 20 mins.. No service.. Walked out and went to jack Astor's next door"}
{"text":"I find the cabin/lodge bars all very cliche and pretty much all the same.  The Loose Moose is really no different except for the fact that it's huge.  I came in for a pint of Mill St organic and the buffalo chicken waffle sandwich while waiting for my train.   My server was awesome and I wish I remember her name.  The sandwich was ok.  I mean it wasn't great but I've definitely had worse food.  I know this place is usually packed for sporting events and they have daily beer specials.  This wouldn't be my first choice of bars but I wouldn't object coming here like some places."}
{"text":"I have been to the Loose Moose for several occasions over the past 12 months.  One thing I like about this place is that they have a private room in the back where you can reserve for a group gathering.  Drink prices are average for the area.  Service is good, no major complaints.  The crowd is young, if there is a game (Leafs, Raptors or Blue Jays), the place is packed.  If you are into sports, this is a good bar to check out."}
{"text":"So The Loose Moose is your typical loud, rowdy sports bar. The food is conventional bar food; nothing too special. EXCEPT for the nachos. I was on a boring date and I was extremely tempted to grab the nachos and RUN. So it's definitely a great place to go if you want to watch a sports game and eat some finger food. It's loud as heck so don't go on a date here or bring your parents. Also, the prices are a little steep so don't expect cheap bar food. I don't like beer but noticed they have a big list of draft beer."}
{"text":"Huge sports bar with two enormous floors and tons of big screen TVs. The food is standard pub grub but relatively well done and the list of beers on tap is impressive including many craft taps. Service is hit or miss but I'd still recommend catching the big game here. At the very least, they will almost certainly have room for you and you can muscle your way up to the bar to order a beer."}
{"text":"My friends and I started out our weekend Toronto adventure here.   We had the whole culinary weekend planned, and this place happened to be the only place that we \"winged\".  It ended up being everyone's favorite meal.  It hits all the points---great, tasty food, nice atmosphere, prompt service, and good beer.  I got the chicken and goat cheese sandwich with the garlic fries.  It was delicious.  Our table also got the poutine.  That was a crowd hit too.   Everyone loved their meal, and washed it all down with some amazing beers.  Loved everything about this place!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place while walking from the Hockey Hall of Fame during a snow storm and were seated promptly for lunch.  The menus were amusing for a few minutes with the mostly naked bodies.  Our drink orders were taken quickly, as were our food orders.  Both were delicious and plentiful. I think this place is totally different during the afternoon than night since I didn't see any women jumping on the bar taking off their bras."}
{"text":"I'll admit this right now; I'm afraid of sports bars. I don't go to them unless I'm being forced, and the people who forces me to go are mostly out of my life now.  My buddy from the Army and Police force had his 40th birthday here, and because he is 90% muscles and 40% tattoo, the Loose Moose was the obvious choice. It's got all the sports showing at once, and everyone here is old....I mean mature. I knew what this was going to be, a showcase of muscles, tattoos, tight shirts, and conversation about who's more noble than the other guy. Almost everyone at my table was on steroids. But I wasn't about to let my buddy off the leash that easily for putting me in this hostile environment..I brought him something would really embarrass him in front of his fellow change-room gladiators. I got him a birthday card.... Man, you should of seen the look on his face. Haha!  I don't remember what I ordered for food, and because my shirt had a collar on it, I was overdressed. I think I was the youngest person here, which always makes me feel comfortable. Really, I was even younger than the tables here, and apparently in much better shape. Usually places with unique names has a story, but I couldn't find anything that told the story.   It's Front Street, are there that many hockey fans keeping this place open? If you're the type of person who whips out his cock to compare it to the guy next to you, this place might be suitable."}
{"text":"Great fresh food, nice servers, awesome music (it's like they were playing my spotify playlist the whole time).   A lot of craft beers on tap too!"}
{"text":"Food is great, service is great We had fish and chips and steak and it was all great and encironment and ceaser salad was awesome. Tottally recommend it."}
{"text":"Bar has been recently remodeled nice place very friendly staff, lots of beer choices 5 large t.v's and several small ones not a bad seat in the house. Come and enjoy a cold one next time you are in Toronto you will not regret it."}
{"text":"The space is good and the bartender was friendly but my sandwich was definitely meh. I walked over for lunch on a weekday since the name is great and it was close to my conference hotel.   I ordered the avocado, brie, tomato and bacon sandwich but asked that they hold the bacon. My bartender said that she ordered it that way all the time. Good sign, right? Well... the bread was cold (maybe it had been frozen) and was way too thick for the fillings. While the avocado was plentiful, the brie was very skimpy. I ended up eating the veg & brie and abandoning the blah bread. My side caesar was good.  The did have a lovely selection of bourbons & whiskys and my old fashioned was fine. So perhaps just drinking here is the best bet."}
{"text":"These guys made accommodations for a party of 9 which was pretty cool.  That party included 5 kids too.  Beer selection was better than average.   Service was top notch and food prices very reasonable.   We loved the loaded poutine, fried pork and pickles and burgers.  Definitely recommended if your staying in the area."}
{"text":"Been going here for years and it is a commuters/pre-sports game hot spot.  The drink selection is quite extensive and the menu offers typical bar food. Overall, it has a good atmosphere, but can be very busy during happy hour and pre-sports games. After 8pm when commuters have left for home or if the sports game has started, it becomes quite empty."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this spot. The industrial decor is really neat, the service was friendly and the food was incredibly flavorful. Fresh and interesting flavor combinations really stood out as original and memorable! I would highly recommend a visit!"}
{"text":"Sat right down, service was a little slow.  Great selection of beer.  Poutine was amazing!  Very eclectic decor.  Would definitely go again for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I really like the Moose - it's a nice change from the usual chain restaurant and is right downtown, great location if you're at Union or seeing a concert/sporting event!  The menu isn't huge, but they cover all the pub basics. Salads, potato skins, sweet potato fries, burgers galore, quesadillas, chicken fingers etc. Prices are average, $11ish dollars for main dishes, $7ish for salads, $4ish dollars for sides.  And as we discovered, Thursday nights they have $3.99 pints of Coors & Canadian!   It's always super packed, and the service is decent enough - beware going the night of a concert, especially if you don't like the artist playing at the ACC. All we heard was Gaga... and another time, all I heard was T-Swift.  Two thumbs up! Great for a casual bite!  Note - Look up when you eat, there's a huuuuuge light fixture made entirely of bottles that runs the length of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great place for a drink and a bite.  I am here visiting and found out that the legal drinking age in Canada is 19, so of course I saw a lot of people younger than me.  There are 2 parts of the bar, upstairs with no music and downstairs with live music.  Even thought you are upstairs, you can still hear all the music from downstairs, so really no reason for you to be down there as music can get loud from time to time.  I was here with 6 of my friends and I ordered Lake of Bays Spring Maple which is a Belgian Blonde, sadly found out that they are out, so I ordered another wheat beer called Side Launch Wheat, which it just said it's a wheat beer on the side of the menu.  I find all these Canadian beer name to be very popular and most of them don't really make any sense.  The drink is very smooth that I had to order another one just for my thirst.  This place is a must visit while you are in Toronto, I sure did enjoy my time here!"}
{"text":"Solid food options, great beer selection. You can build your own flights with 3 oz. sample sizes of any of their 30+ on tap beers. Not sure if there's another place in Toronto where you can watch American college football, soccer/world football,  MLB baseball,  and a live rock concert at the same time, but I'll choose the Loose Moose. Quite friendly and accommodating for an over-the-top sportsbar/tap house."}
{"text":"Love coming here with friends to enjoy sporting events and drinks."}
{"text":"Ahhh, It's no wonder that this Moose is loose, because on any given day it's packed to capacity with happily buzzing patrons getting their \"cheapish\" beer (by comparison to local sports venues) fill before heading into a Leafs, Raptors or Jays game.  Some might be turned off by the crowds and the potential wait times for a table, but that shouldn't stop you from grabbing some real-estate by the bar and grabbing one of their many beers on tap - dozens upon dozens of domestic, premium and craft beer options.  The food selection varies from bar standards to the gastro variety, all kicked up that extra notch to be what I would call casual gourmet. The calamari, their selection of burgers, chicken fingers and even their ahi tuna tacos are definitely a treat, especially if your other option is Jack Astors or arena food... or dare I say street meat... yuck.  Pro-Tip: Leave your number with the host/hostess and they'll text you when your table is ready, no stress, just get their early enough and grab a spot on the bar and drink the time away.  As for decor, I love this place, totally up my alley. Wood, exposed beams... you know that look.  Definitely a fave for me, even if it's a sports fan/tourist trap.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here 2 nights in a row. The food was good, great atmosphere and in spite of the comments about poor service-we had excellent waitresses both nights and prompt service..of the food ordered:ahi tacos were good, spicy but the soft shell didn't hold up; nachos were very good, tuna BLT-delicious, meatloaf-not the favorite item but not bad. How could you not love a place that uses bacon in everything including the desserts!"}
{"text":"Hung out at the moose for the hip concert on Saturday  and came back the next five nights. Great place to have a couple after a game with great selection of beers. The wings are really good as well."}
{"text":"They have a really good selection of beers. My favourites, if you are looking for something light and citrusy, are the Lake of bays spring maple Belgian blonde and the Side launch wheat beers. The Peruvian chicken bites as an appetizer  is also very flavourful."}
{"text":"We had a good time! Contrary to other reviews I've read, the service we had was decent, the food was enjoyable and the drink selection very pleasant! Prices comparable. The atmosphere is the real draw (for me), long and fancy bar top, sofas and high tops, picnic tables, old wood and decor."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 20 people about 2 months before the date but when we arrived there was a massive line and the security pretty much told us we were shit out of luck. After about 45 mins of yelling at 4 different people we were slowly allowed to go in 3 people at a time. I was told it was because of the raptors and blue jays game but whats the point of a reservation then? We got no apology for how we were treated and eventually got to our table. The night after that was generally good minus the server being slow but I assumed that was due to our large party size. I'd go back but I would make sure it was at lunch so I didn't have to deal with the overly rude door staff. Note to Loose moose- you need to organize the way you handle the crowd. It's unacceptable."}
{"text":"Late night dinner after delayed flight arrivals found me here at the sports bar - not much else was open where the kitchen was still cooking. I was hesitant at first because it really appeared to be a place focused on drinks, and I was hoping for a decent meal despite the late hour. Self-serve seating, and a waiter dropped by with menus shortly after. He was friendly and helpful - the beer list was long and I didn't even know where to start. I ordered the mac n cheese sandwich with a chocolatey stout (by recommendation, I forget the name...oops? It was definitely to my taste though!) and both were satisfactory. A burger was also ordered at the table - satisfactory, nothing excessively surprising, not much to write home about.  The mac n cheese was great while it was warm - added substance to a grilled cheese to make it a meal. I wish it had come warmer because once it cooled the pasta began to harden and the cheese solidified. Aside that, a solid meal.  Having gone in with no expectations, I was pleasantly surprised. Their beer list is comprehensive and will satisfy many palates, and their food turned out to be better than expected. If I'm in the area looking for a late night meal, will definitely consider a return visit."}
{"text":"Though the portions served at the Loose Moose are really huge, and presentation is interesting (burger is served in a frying pan) the food quality itself leaves more to be desired. I ordered a burger (forgot which) and it was quite flavourless. Patty seemed unseasoned, and there were no condiments on the burger either. Since I went as a group, I was able to taste and ask about other people's food as well. It seems the blandness carries over to all the burgers, the fish and chips and the wings as well. I think the only reason why this place had received positive reviews in the past is because of the good service and the fun atmosphere. The decor is neat, the lighting is composed of empty beer bottle which is cool. But personally, I am someone that mainly goes to restaurants for food, the environment is just a bonus. Overall I've been to better bars/restaurants with better food quality and similar environment. Loose Moose is nothing exceptional, and they are priced like any other bar so there is no excuse for the disappointing food quality."}
{"text":"This Place is Terrible for Food. Their prices are hefty for the little portion of poor quality food they offer. Ordered the Chicken & Waffles Sandwich and it looked like a Appetizer & was dry, I guess they drenched it in buffalo to cover up the dryness. Tourist Stay away, Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Just went for drinks. But I loved how big the bar was! My boyfriend and I were visiting Toronto for the weekend. We easily found a seat at the bar and all of the bartenders were nice and friendly. The Drink selection was amazing and there were so many craft beers I hadn't heard of. I was so happy to be able to try new beers! My boyfriend and I stayed for over two hours just enjoying the atmosphere and talking. Will go back whenever we visit again."}
{"text":"It's pub/sports bar! Tonight it was the World Junior Bar!   Lots of TVs around to watch the game, no matter which area of the place you sat. My friend and I grabbed a table near the back. We ordered a couple of drinks... Sundays $3 Ceasars... So naturally, I had one of each! 1- Traditional Vodka Cesar. Had a nice spice to it! Garnished with your regular celery stick 2- Tequila Ceasar.. mmmm was strong just the way I like it! But it also had a sweetness to it. Again spicy! Yum! 3- Gin Ceasar.. My favorite!   I my friend and I both ordered the Big Bitchin' Green Salad: arugula, shredded vegetables, radish, ripe tomato, pea sprouts, roasted almonds, crispy taro, scallion vinaigrette! Soo delicious and was a nice size! I sided my salad with grilled chicken which was a little dry. :(  I dabbled a bit onto our other friends nacho plate.. standard beef nachos.  My fave dish of the night was a warm chocolate brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate drizzle and roasted peanut pieces. YUUUUMMMMOOOO!!  Now the service this night was subpar I gave them some consideration as it was game night and busy. My experience that makes this place a 4/5 stars is the food, atmosphere and the company I shared it with!   I would come again! Especially for that brownie dessert!"}
{"text":"Terrible food stale bun on sandwich. Cesar salad was poor too. Less than average service. There's some atmosphere bit no food value."}
{"text":"We came here three girls after the blue jays game and we waited forcever for service but we paid no attention to it and  gave them the benefit of the doubt, we work in restaurants too, we went to go out for a cigarette . We were all smokers and when we went to go for a smoke because service was taking so long we figured food would as well as there was a lot more orders in front of us. They said we could only leave a credit card and we brought small purses because we only went to the blue jays game thinking we would only need maybe ID debit and cash . They would only accept a credit card when j have them my passport they wouldn't accept it which is absolutely ridiculous !!!"}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun. Watched some March Madness at the bar with my son, had a few drinks, and ate some surprisingly good food - nachos, chicken Caesar salad, and some spicy chicken dish. The staff isn't the most attentive, but it's a large, busy bar so what do you expect. However, when a large group of guys started bothering half the other patrons they were decisive - stopped serving them alcohol and kept an eye on them. Well done."}
{"text":"On a terribly cold, windy day of visiting a trade show, my friend and I were starving. We had taken the GO Train in and were looking for something close to Union Station....and there it was, The Loose Moose.   We (literally) ran in and hoped they could seat us. It was packed! Luckily, their bench style seating allowed us to squeeze in. It's HUGE and perfectly designed for a fun, pub atmosphere. Hell, even the bathrooms were fun; random antique stall doors, random sinks, even random taps! Not to mention, the beer selection was fantastic! It's never too cold for beer!   The menu has a good variety; there is something for everyone. Some of the meals had fun names. You don't make friends with salad, you say? What if it's called a Big Bitchin' Green? Definitely sounds better than 'salad.'    I went with the Avocado, Tomato, Brie and Bacon and my friend went with the Classic Burger. I couldn't believe how much avocado was on this sandwich; I could barely take a bite! To top off this wonderful creation, it was on a BACON foccacia. It had strips of bacon baked INTO the bread. Amazing. The burger was juicy and the toppings were fresh. The fries were pretty good too. The beer just topped it all off!   Great location, great service, great food and beer. I would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Wondering around on a Saturday lunchtime during a visit to Toronto. Heard that this place had a selection of local craft brews so stopped in. Wasn't too busy, sat at bar, few pints and crispy haddock tacos later. Gotta give it a thumbs up. Friendly good selection of beer decent menu. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Hey, do you like over priced beer that are underpriced when compared to other sports district offerings? Do you also love food that comes in a big heap as if it was vomited onto the plate? Than you'll love The Loose Moose!!"}
{"text":"Will definitely be back!!  Went there on a Thursday night. The host was friendly and sat us right away. Unfortunately we were sat at a table for 2 that was practically over-looking the server station so we could overhear their conversations the whole night. That wasn't a huge problem just because they weren't hanging out there often, but when they were there we felt like we were being watched by the servers while we were eating.  I like that you can choose different sized glasses of wine. I got the local Peller Estates Sauv. Blanc and it was very good. My fiance got one of the craft beers off of their vast beer menu that includes about 50 beers on tap. The server was nice and informed us they were out of several of the drafts beers. For an appetizer we ordered the \"Sweet Potato Thing\" which is sweet potato fries, french fries and onions all fried and cooked with a coconut chili dipping sauce. The appetizer was soooo good, but the one thing that we wished the server had mentioned to us was how massive the appetizer was.It was WAY too big for two people to try and tackle. It came out on this mini baking sheet and it was huge. Between the 2 of us, we only ate less than half of it. We were glad that our meals came out quickly so that we could stop trying to eat this mound of fried potatoes and onions. Next time I would only get that if I was there with a group of at least 4 or 5 people. For my meal I had the \"Big Bitchin' Green\" which was arugula, shredded vegetables, radish, ripe tomato, pea sprouts, roasted almonds, crispy taro, and scallion vinaigrette; and I added the seared tuna to it. It was so delicious, I would absolutely order that again! The portion was filling without feeling over stuffed, the seared tuna was very good quality. My fiance got the Braised Pork quesadillas with Citrus Achiote Marinade. He enjoyed them and I enjoyed the bite that he let me steal.  The restaurant had a very fun, inviting atmosphere. I like all of the mismatching chairs. When we got there, the music was coming from a stereo system in the corner and the hostess had warned us that the live band would be starting soon downstairs. (I was very glad that she had mentioned that ahead of time). Sure enough about halfway through our meal, the live band started playing downstairs. It was loud to us upstairs but not too loud to continue our conversation. I liked how there were quite a few large TVs around also  I would definitely recommend this place to others and I will be bringing friends here when they come to visit.  I would have given this 5 stars if we weren't sat at the table against the server station and if the server had warned us that the appetizer we order was huge and definitely too big for only 2 people to be eating."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while visiting friends in Canada and I really liked it. The staff was all helpful and friendly. It's a nice sports bar with some tables having mini tvs on the wall next to them. You can watch pretty much whatever you want regarding sports.   The food was pretty awesome I thought. I had their special buffalo chicken sandwich that has a waffle for a bun - so goooood!- with the sweet potato fries which were yummy as well. I tried a Steam Whistle which I liked. The onion rings were really good and good compliments about the veggie burger were given. The buffalo chicken nachos were huge and they gave really good portions of sour cream, salsa and guacamole which was extra. I would go back if the opportunity ever arose.  I love the chandelier type lighting fixture that runs from the from of the building to the back and is made up of all the different bottles. Very creative!"}
{"text":"best steakhouse ive ever been in. service was good. the sweet potato was fresh and crispy but again the steak was to die for"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Manager was very rude. Will never return. Anyone who is deciding to go here, be smart and try any of the other 100 restaurants in the area. You will be very disappointed with the service. The food was also very greasy. Also, they will try to pack your boys with extra calories. TOURISTS BEWARE!"}
{"text":"This was my second time going to The Loose Moose. I managed to reserve a spot for 20 people here as a go away party for one of my coworkers on a Wednesday around 5:30pm. I had no hassle with my reservation, and was very please they could seat that many people, with separate bills as well.  I like the vibe in this place. Didn't really pay attention to the music, but there were lots of of people which made the place lively. It was already getting packed at 5:30 on a weekday!  We were seated at a longggg table. I do wish that they would have blocked off an area where mingling was easier, but instead we sat next to each other and had to walk up and over to talk to people not near you. That was my biggest disappointment, but it wasn't bad enough to ruin the night.  While a few of us were waiting for the rest to show up, we ordered our normal boring coors light to start and food. I ended up getting a classic burger and fries, which goes perfectly with a night of too many beers. :)  i ended up staying till 10 as the group was getting smaller and smaller. The weightless managed to remember everyone who paid and didn't yet and made sure they did without forgetting - props to her! I didn't end up having to cover anyones bill, phew!  Overall great night with relatively cheap beers. Check this place out if you're in the area and want to get your drank on."}
{"text":"A great selection on tap, friendly staff, good food.  Slower service than I'd like but the great demeanor of the waiter more than made up. I wouldn't come here expecting efficiency or if you're in a hurry.  They had nice big screens tho and we had a great time watching the leafs.  The nachos are very worth it. Pretty big portions with lots of cheese. My loaded mac n cheese was good (some macaroni pieces were mushy) but at almost $17, I wish i got something else instead. Chicken and waffles were interesting, small parts of the chicken was dry but the waffles and fries and most of the chicken was good otherwise. Wish they gave the traditional syrup tho. The syrup was some weird spicy tangy thing, it was only ok. The Gouda burger was big and juicy. Overall a good time."}
{"text":"The Loose Moose has always been there but recently it is starting to gain ground for me personally over the other restaurants in the mega Sir Corp group.  I am not completely sure the decision matrix that decides what goes on tap here vs. say, Dukes Refresher but stuff like the Sawdust City Tap takeover upstairs and the Collective Arts takeover downstairs.  I just like the idea of \"Drinking Local\"...   and the food is decent (see my photo of the dirty bird).  Will be looking for future events and put this on the \"regular\" schedule."}
{"text":"It's hard to get a waitress attention. But when they see you, they serve you well. Nice sportive environment and good food."}
{"text":"I would stay away from this restaurant/ bar. The staff & security did not want to cater to large group. They were extremely rude. Stay far far way from here."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! Stay away from their Mac and cheeze, way too cooked and liquid sauce, I returned it . Then I took the chicken quesadillas, way too spicy, wasn't able to eat it. REALLY!!!!  However the service was great!"}
{"text":"La fin du monde on tap was enough for me to give this place five stars.  Add to that that bartenders here actually enjoy and are knowledgeable about various types of beer and this place is great for a beer geek."}
{"text":"This place is only marginally better than Jack Astor's around the corner, but still not somewhere I would choose to dump my money given the other options available not far from here.  It's a split level bar, with a DJ up top, and I'm sure some type of food is served to those willing to risk their health. The music was ok, but it's basically all top 40 stuff, with no sense of originality to speak of. The beer is not quite as overpriced as Astor's, but the selection is even smaller.  Apparently they have \"MILF Thursdays\" (picture included) which consists of cheap margaritas and live music. I have not seen this event, but I'm sure the name brings out Toronto's finest, if not most experienced, patrons."}
{"text":"Meh. We had been here before and really enjoyed it, and since we were downtown for an event at Ripleys, hungry and had time to kill, figured we'd go again. Way too loud, service way too slow, had to ask multiple times for a glass of water and food was on the low side of average. Probably won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Great food, but the service wasn't fantastic. We had to ask several times for ranch dressing and finally ended up going to the kitchen door to get it ourselves. It wasn't even that busy! However, my fish tacos were delicious."}
{"text":"Great sports bar with a wonderful selection of beer (domestic and foreign). Great apps that pair well with the drinks if you're here to watch sports game.  I recommend the half dozen bacon donuts! They're really delicious!"}
{"text":"This is basically an oversized dive bar. Despite their efforts with the recent renovations, this place just screams college crowd and barely legals.  Don't ever get the food here.  You've been warned.  The beer selection is pretty good, lots of stuff on tap.  Don't expect stellar service but never really had an issue here.  Fine for after work or late night drinks."}
{"text":"The last time I remember visiting the Loose Moose was the night I met the Hubster, nearly 10 years ago. Back then, it was a dank, quirky dive bar with bras on the ceiling.  It's still slightly quirky (there's an arcade in the back), but decidedly not dank nor divey. Gone are the cheap cafeteria-like tables and instead they have bar-height exposed wood slabs. The food that other people ordered looked great and in massive quantities. The sweet potato fries we ordered were tasty and crisp. They have a good selection of draft beer.   My only complaint is that I'm old now. Or more specifically, I find the place VERY loud and quite dark (seriously, reading the menu from an iphone light?) Sure, maybe it's because we were seated in a dark corner at point blank range to a speaker, but moving seats didn't improve the situation much.   Service was friendly and came around when they needed to.   I might be back again, but I'll always miss that dank little basement where I fell in love."}
{"text":"What a beer list - WOW! The food is all equally awesome.  Our waitress was attentive & knew the beer menu well.  Great stop during a busy day of walking around the city!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here before a concert at Air Canada Centre. It was a close walk. There is an upstairs and a downstairs. They both have bars and tables. We initially walked into the upstairs, but we were directed downstairs since they were busier. I was fine with this though because it was much relaxed and quieter downstairs.   We decided to share a sandwich, as we were not crazy hungry. We split the chicken club sandwich, which came with a caeser salad. They generously took it upon themselves to give us separate plates with half of the sandwich and our own individual salads. I thought this was pretty thoughtful, especially considering we were only paying the price for one. It worked out perfectly. The salad was very good. The sandwich was also very tasty. The chicken was not dry and the sun dried tomato sauce on it complemented the sandwich nicely.   We grabbed some drinks beforehand, as well. The drinks were reasonably priced, considering it is in the heart of downtown Toronto. They have several different beers to choose from and the over all atmosphere is very rustic.  I would definitely recommend stopping in here for a drink or a quick bite to eat. The service was great, along with the food and drinks!"}
{"text":"I used to work upstairs and frequent this place quite often, so it has an nostalgic and sentimental feeling for me.   I used to be a member of the stein club that would allow you to buy mammoth sized schooners for a low price.   Food wise, I would recommend their burgers. However this is an old building in the core of down town. So the hygiene of this place was always a concern. However, after chugging down a few. Who remembers these things anyway.   They also play live cover bands downstairs and generally always have some corporate sponsor giving away freebies.   Great Toronto establishment. Great Place to Drink."}
{"text":"I'm giving this four stars but I think the experience would be very different depending on where you're sitting or standing.   This place gets super busy so come two hours before a game! Seriously. It was just me and my boyfriend, we arrived two hours early and the upstairs area was full. We managed to get seats at the bar. I called in advanced but was told they do not take reservations.  The bartenders were extremely kind and we managed to get everything we ordered. Initially, the service was very fast. However, if you are standing at the back or you weren't able to get seats,  your experience might be very different. I overheard dozens of people over my shoulder complaining they waited 30 minutes for a beer. Some didn't get a beer the entire game. Even for my boyfriend and I seated right at the bar, grabbing a drink took a while. No complaints on our side though since the game took a while and we weren't in a rush. I can imagine the others' frustration though having to wait over someone's shoulder trying to flag the bar tender down for 15-20 minutes.   We ordered the big bitchin salad which was okay. Get the  dressing on the side because it's quite oily. The sweet and spicy wings were also okay. A bit on the pricey end.  There's a huge selection of beers, a bit on the pricy side though, but here's something for everybody.   The atmosphere is great though. Lots of cheers and it gets pretty loud. Everyone is also pretty happy and very friendly. Highly recommend watching the game here,"}
{"text":"They have the brown gestapos at the door, big change from 30 years ago. I was walking in when all of a sudden the door guy tells me they're at full capacity, no room for one more patron. He then yells at me like I'm a dog, telling me to line up against the wall.   No class."}
{"text":"After we walked in, we seated ourselves at an empty table of our choice and then our server greeted us shortly afterwards.  The place was popping with a lot of people hanging about either watching the huge sports TVs or socializing.  It was a loud place but I was still able to easily hear the person next to me.    I got the Warm Chocolate Brownie which was actually really, really good!  (Possibly one of the best brownie desserts I've had to date!)  It was a classic warm double chocolate brownie that came with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce and roasted peanuts.  I'm not even a fan of peanuts usually but these scattered roasted peanuts worked really well with the dessert.  The warmth of the double chocolate brownie paired with the cold and sweet vanilla ice cream was perfect.  I gobbled it up quickly since it was so good.  For $6, I also thought it was such a generous dessert considering it was a restaurant in the downtown core.  K got the Chicken & Waffle Sandwich (Southern fried buffalo chicken, dill-vinaigrette slaw, roasted garlic aioli) with came with mixed greens (or you could choose a side of fries or chopped Caesar).  It looked great.  I tried it bite of it and it was good.  The mixed greens were also very fresh and a good size.  I was intrigued with their craft beers and beer on tap.  Their drink menu showed that you could try a sample of the beer (3 oz) for just $1.31 which I thought was such a steal and so much fun to do!  Thus, we ended up ordering two rounds of 3 oz beers to try.    I would definitely come again for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Went here after a Jay's game yesterday, lucky we got in because it got really busy really quick. Can't remember what it was called but I had steak salad of some kind. It was excellent. Grilled steak, a rice blend, thinly sliced carrots and radish, and some other stuff I can't remember. Other than it getting a little louder than we liked it was a great place."}
{"text":"Burgers are awesome! Fries are good, the stock of beer is extended - it took me 10 min to look through all the options and finally make a decision )).  I will give the service 3 stars because my friend ordered another beer and the lady simply forgot about it, so we had to ask another waiter."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, was packed thou. Double game night. Started with garlic fries which were good.   My main course was their woody burger, 6 oz patty burger, bacon cheese. Their sauce was decilous. Patty was juicy, was pretty filling, could been bigger for the price.  15 buck was a bit much for a single patty"}
{"text":"Great spot for drinks and food. Loved their fries with bacon and sausage. Fried calamari was super delicious. I'll definitely be back. The place is spacious, has a lot of tv screens by the bar, and their staff was very polite."}
{"text":"Large bar area with large craft beer selection. Good looks good but didn't have time to eat"}
{"text":"This place is more than just a bar with bar food. In fact the food was so good we came back the following night. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"We stopped by the Moose on two occasions during Masters weekend to watch golf, drink beer, and munch out. The Moose hosts a pretty extensive beer menu and a full bar. We sat at the bar, golf view, and our bartenders made sure we were never dry. We ordered some Apps and they filled the void nicely. We did not order entrees but they looked pretty good going by. The Moose is a great meet up bar or venue to watch sports."}
{"text":"Decent place to go and grab a drink and watch whatever game is on. This place was right down the street from the hotel we stayed at so we came a couple times when we were totally sure what to do. The food and the service was pretty good.  I got the veggie sandwich and when I asked for no cheese, the waitress asked if I was a vegan because there was chipotle mayo on it I would need to remove as well. That was very thoughtful to me considering most of the time people don't think to ask.  I also got the guacamole and chip. The guac and salsa it came with tasted like prepackaged guac rather than fresh. Not bad, but not what I expected Overall it was pretty average. Nothing bad about it, but it wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"Really cool place. I liked it a lot.  Had the black bean dip appetizer, which was good. The dip had a nice spice to it and the chips had a tasty seasoning.  I had the \"one pound of chicken wings,\" which is really just 8 wings. Was it really one pound? I didn't bother to get out my scale. I had the hot buffalo sauce, which was good and spicy. Wasn't blown away but not disappointed.  Went with a few other people, two of which had burgers, which both looked good and came with a good amount of fries.  The other had three very very small chicken tacos that were good, but I most emphasize, very small.  Staff was polite and helpful. Cute waitresses."}
{"text":"We went here after a raptors game and it wasn't good a time. I ordered some kind of mixed drink and I can honestly say now I know was poop in a glass tastes and looks like (it was horrible I slammed down the drink then chugged a glass of water).  My friends shared a pitcher between them so apparently that was good (I didn't partake) but one of them got a burger which comes with only tomato and lettuce on it and they put the condiments on the table which is ok, but they completely forgot to put any condiments were we had to wait 5ish minutes for the condiments where they only dropped off ketchup and mustard so after waiting again we asked for mayo in which they gave us a little cup of it ( in which my friend had to use a French fry to spread it on her burger).  I've learned now that apparently if you do not ask you do not receive anything at all.....including cutlery"}
{"text":"Attended an after work event. Enjoyed a glass of wine and appys. The sliders were really good and the grilled cheese sandwich with caramelized onions were delicious. I liked that there's a private back room so we could mingle but the location is a bit odd since people had to walk through to get to and from the kitchen and restrooms. But, overall great place to stop by for drinks."}
{"text":"4 stars for the exceptional customer service and beer selection. Thank you Maria! Okay, so straight up, the Woody Burger is so overated. Sure the bun is a soft panini? with bacon strips on it :) , but the patty was dry. It comes with a cheddar cheese slice, more bacon, and some sorta house sauce. All I'm saying is that I've had better burgers. I was very disappointed with the French fries. They simply sucked so much. I left most of it cause fries are bad for you anyways."}
{"text":"Ate at The Loose Moose primarily because we thought the name was funny but it turned out to be some excellent food as well.  Had the fried calamari as an appetizer and it was top notch.  I've had many variations of mustard aioli with calamari and theirs was one of the best.  If I had known how much calamari there was going to be I probably would have ordered something smaller for dinner!  Being ugly Americans we thought the entrees were on the small size, but realistically they were the perfect proportion without being too filling.  My husband got the Chicken Club House sandwich and loved the chipotle mayonnaise.  I had the Crispy Beer Battered Fish and Chips and it was delicious!  The fish was some of the freshest I've ever been served and the fries have a seasoning on them which made them delicious.    Drinks wise they had a nice selection, but for a pub I thought they could have more beers.  Our waitress recommended two different local beers for us to try and they were both great (Steamwhistle and Mill St. Organic).  I liked the decor and seating arrangement as well.  Bonus points for having free wi-fi!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great.  We went there on a monday night, but the staff was still great, the place was full, but not packed and for a sports bar, the food was delicious.  I would definitely recommend this for any sporting event or just a good time."}
{"text":"I have visited The Loose Moose on multiple occasions. Whether it was after a conference, before the Jays game or a concert, or just hanging out with friends, The Moose has been a good centralized location with fairly consistent service. making it one of my favourite places in the Front/University area.   I don't recall ever having bad service here. They usually know if you go at a certain time, you're probably just stopping by for a quick bite and drink before a game or a show, so the food comes out pretty quickly. Just because the food comes out quickly doesn't mean quality of food suffers either. Oh, and they also play pretty good music here too!  Honestly, I think their menu is much better than the neighbouring Jack Astor's, so if you're in the area, go to The Moose!"}
{"text":"Went here for an early dinner on a Sunday night & we were seated quickly. The food was delicious -- I had the Mac & grilled cheese sandwich with tomato bisque. They also had a nice drink selection. The waitress did not interrupt us every few minutes which was nice, since it was clear we were enjoying our food. I liked having the space to enjoy a meal out and have a conversation."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here this past saturday night after working a long day at the Fan Expo convention across the street, The place is your typical sports bar with a decent beer menu.  The place is good for large groups, we had 16 people.  The nacho plates are a good appetizer to share for large groups.  I ordered the chicken astoria with a side of poutine. The sandwich was ok but the gravy was a bit on the salty side.  My friend order the fish and chips which i though was a better choice since the dish came with a whole breaded fish fillet instead of your typical fish stick type.  THe meatloaf also looked good but I think they use the same gravy as the poutine.  Overall it was a decent meal, cool place to hang out, and conviently located near the convention center and the major hotels."}
{"text":"Average bar. Prices, selection, service, crowd are all exactly average."}
{"text":"I would give it zero stars if I could.  Horrible meal and the service was the same.  The waitress recommended the burgers but they were out 5 minutes later at 730 on a Saturday night.  My friend tried to order beer but half of the menu was obsolete.  Finally ordered fish and chips but returned it since it had such a terrible taste.  Wouldn't return again."}
{"text":"I thought this was a cool place - definitely a great name - and the chicks in here are hot and dressed like S & M bad girls - my opinion.    Me and my buddy came in here Saturday night before heading over to the ACC for the Leafs/Sens game - horror show, but that's another story - and it seems that everyone else in here was doing the same thing.    We got the bacon something-or-other nachos, which was a meal in itself, along with some beers.  It was a good time."}
{"text":"Here from the States so was looking for a good bite and a cold beer.  I got both.  It was loud which made conversing a challenge but I left satisfied."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled Mac & Cheese sandwich with a bowl of tomato bisque. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"A more-than-decent spot to pre-game before an NBA game. It's got a wide menu with a lot of local, craft, and international beers on tap.  This is a pub through and through. Lots of the TVs around so you can always catch the game. The interior is all about that wood design to make it warm and welcoming. It can get loud, it can get really crowded on game nights, and it can be the start of a fun night.  We decided to share three appetizers to set the stage for the night. We had a plate of nachos that was generous with the cheese and toppings, the fried pork and pickles were juicy and crunchy, and the poutine was just done simply with crispy fries, lots of curds, and a pile of gravy to melt it all together.   It didn't have a lot of frills and it's not needed when you need food/energy to balance out the pints and pints of alcohol.  I would consider making this my go-to spot for a meet-up spot in the future."}
{"text":"I happened to drop into the Loose Moose for an apres drink post Toronto Maple Leafs game last week. I understand the concept - make an average bar seem better by draping the entire place with ladies bra's. I can see why the crowd was 80% male, and the rest female. But what was hard to understand, is why would woman take off their bra's and sling them on the rafters?  I guess what it all comes down to is this - alcohol makes you do pretty much anything! We did manage to see one poor girl get up on the bar, but was too \"respectable\" to leave her bra behind.  If there is anyone that reads this review, please tell me why woman would subject themselves to this behaviour!! Or maybe there's a free pitcher of beer in it for them??  I am not going to begin to review the food, as it was what you would expect from a bra yielding establishment - not very good.  The staff were friendly, and the 100 or so T.V's that covered the entire place provided me an ample fix to my sports watching needs.  This place is loud, so enjoy your pint of beer, and hope you encounter one of Toronto's finest ladies strutting her stuff on the bar. Maybe just maybe you will see a souvenir left behind!"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my dude because we were super indecisive. You are met with a bouncer dude, and he checked our ID's before we're allowed in. Thanks for making us feel young. :D   We went down into the Antler room. The Moose room upstairs is mostly the \"restaurant\" portion, and Antler is usually used for drinks, in a sports bar type of atmosphere. Overall, stuff was clean and spacious. It was rather bright in the Antler, which I liked. The TV was huge; I could see the pores on the athletes' faces.   I ordered a Jerk Chicken plate which consists of the chicken breast, veg (edamame + broccoli), wild grains rice, and this mango salsa thing that was just a hint of spicy. My dude ordered some burger thing that had bacon and fries with it.   The jerk chicken was ... the best grilled and marinated chicken I've ever had. It was flavourful and juicy, and the chicken retained its natural chicken taste. It goes superbly well if you eat it with the mango salsa. Their broccoli was great and juicy as well. I felt neutral about the wild grains rice but that's only because I don't like wild grains anyway... but it was still delicious.   Jerk chicken was 5/5.   Fries were also 5/5. They came salty (even though I didn't see the salt on it). It was crispy throughout and the oil it was fried in was not old. I loved it.   So why 4 stars? Because their drinks menu. I know they pride themselves on their tap selection, but I was really hoping they could have some Japanese selections too, although I guess that isn't very sports bar-ish.   I'd definitely recommend to come here again. I could have that grilled chicken for days. Also, their fries are to salivate for."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Went there on Canada Day and still were able to get a table within 30 mins. Sat at the bar and had a couple of beers. Service at the bar was great. They have open style tables, so you share a big table with other people. We ordered regular poutine and sliders and it was amazing. We got the donuts for desert and it was unreal. Great service, friendly atmosphere, and plenty of beer!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, as I'll give this place the following benefits: -very close to Union Station and the Metro Convention Centre, and a short walkable distance to the Skydome or ACC -wide tap selections including both craft and big brand options -perfectly adequate service -decent sized space with tables or bar access  I've never actually eaten here as we've used the place as a meeting spot, post-work drinks spot, or just random stop in as it was this weekend... Looking at the food, I will say that it isn't really the most exciting menu which is another part of my general hesitation to eating here. A prime example would be the cringe worthy item that is just plate of mini hot dogs (?) entitled \"Honey Who Shrunk My Weiner\".   To talk about the tap list for a minute though, they have 2 rotating craft taps and a rotating cask, in addition to their extensive beer options. Additionally, they offer sampling flights with what I believe are 3oz samples for around $1.20-$1.60 each so you can do sampling flights. They even have the IBU's listed on the menus as well, which is pretty rare. Pints are actually 18oz glasses which is the happy medium between the standard imperial 20oz pint and the frequently found 16oz american pint pours we see so much of nowadays. Craft wise you'll find great options from a number of Ontarios best including Nicklebrook, Beaus, Muskoka Brewery, Side Launch, Sawdust City, Spearhead, and Flying Monkeys to name a few. And while I hate to admit it since I'm 99% of the time a craft beer snob, they even had a couple big brand beers that I was impressed by like Lagunitas and Brew Dog IPA.  This is probably my favourite of the Sir Corp owned restaurants, and in the grand scheme of Front St restaurants, the Loose Moose is a decent option if you're looking for a tasty barley based beverage."}
{"text":"Pretty good sports bar... although being an American die-hard football fan, I was kind of sad to see it so empty on a Sunday.  Especially because I heard the place gets off the chainz.  It's hard being an immigrant in this foreign land!   The food was great, though, I recommend the huge-ass nachos."}
{"text":"Went here from a personal recommendation (gasp! I got a recommendation from a real live person! Lol)   It's an everyman kinda bar,..Good place to catch a game and a beer. I ordered a rum old fashioned,..and it was \"ok\". Got a second one and asked for a different rum and it tasted much better.   They have a long bar that goes from the entrance all the way to the back. Those sitting at the parts that jutted out, probably have a more \"small local bar\" feel. But visually it was not nice,..seemed to just pull focus on how big the place was."}
{"text":"Why do people go so crazy about this spot? Service is absolute crap here and the food isn't as good as the menu makes it sound. Wowowow just because you've been around Toronto for so damn long doesn't mean you're such a cool spot.   Let me tell you- this place is just a spot full of old buddies catching up before the game, during the game or after work. It's such a 'bro' spot, and I say that in the most 'roll-my-eyes' kind of way.   Our server seemed genuinely annoyed that we were there and getting anything seemed to take forever. It took me literally 20 minutes to ask another glass of water from this other server, who actually rolled her eyes when I asked and walked away without a response. Well sorry I didn't want to bother you either, but literally our server only served tables of dudes AROUND us and ignoring us. Even when I was trying to get my bill, it didn't come before I had to leave. I had to give my $ to my friend so he could pay for me because I had to catch my damn train. How the hell does it take you over 15 min to bring me my bill??   The food is not anything special, literally food I can get anywhere else. Just because the menu is 'quirky' and has 'bitchin' written all over it, does not make it delicious OR food that people go there especially for.   I'm not trying to be dramatic but you could not drag my dead corpse into this place again."}
{"text":"The Loose Moose is located below the Armadillo Texas Grill and is usually packed with suits and locals getting hammered before a Blue Jays Game or Maple Leaf Game. The bar has some interesting decor items - tons of bras hung from the ceiling as well as myriad of empty liquor bottles. This ain't the Ritz Carlton.  The food is standard - pub grub, nachos, chicken wings, burgers, draft beer. It's got a solid lunch crowd but an even bigger evening and late night crowd. Its nothing to write home about, but if you get drunk enough you probably won't care what you're eating.   Allegedly, the Loose Moose even gets its fair share of beloved Blue Jay players coming to grab a bite and pint.   If you're heading to a game downtown, this is a great place to stop off for some pre-game beers and food. Otherwise, I would head around the corner to Jack Astor's."}
{"text":"Ate at this place at two different instances and the food was exceptionally great, both times. The service is very friendly and quick.   Ordered the Jerk Chicken and Tacos the second time we visited and split with the husband. Would definitely recommend this place for food and drinks both.   Really liked the ambiance and crowd as well. It has a very chilled out vibe and is a great place to hang out for an extended period. It's definitely one of the best sports bars in Toronto.   Will definitely go here again, the next time I'm in town!!"}
{"text":"Love it! Love it! It's the place we hangout before the Jays game. Never disappointed with their food and drinks. We ordered three appetizers. The woody's slider is sooo good. I'm supersede how good it is. It got the smoky flavour and the size is perfect for sharing. It has great atmosphere. It's definitely a nice spot to have couples of drinks before the game!"}
{"text":"Friend suggested to meet up for lunch here at the Loose Moose since it is close to her workplace. Both of us were not that hungry so we ordered the quinoa salad and honey garlic chicken wings to share. Both were really yummy! The portion of quinoa salad was more than enough for the two of us, came with lettuce, chickpeas, goat cheese, purple onions and drizzled with a light dressing. I enjoyed the salad a lot because there was a bit of everything and we could munch on it while talking! The chicken wings were crispy and coated with just the right amount of sauce so you won't have excessive sauce dripping everywhere. Staffs were attentive and friendly and our glasses of water were always filled before we ask! After reading some of the reviews I was worried that the food would not deliver but it exceeded my expectations and I would definitely go back for some beer and wings (and maybe try their ribs as well) next time!"}
{"text":"Had a quick bite and beer before the Drake concert this week.  Bae and I sat at the bar. We told the bartender we were in a rush (just had about a half hour before the concert) and he was great about being speedy.  I enjoyed a Bobcaygeon craft beer (yum) and the fish tacos - both were great! Bae had wings and another kind of beer, also both good.  Solid option when in the area!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was nice.  The beverage selection was okay.  The waitress was nice.  The portions were, okay I guess...   Have you noticed the lack of enthusiasm here? Well I felt some type of way about the food.  After the first bite of the cheese burger, an overwhelming sensation of \"meh!\" washed upon me. The sensation continued through to  the sweet potato fries ($3.50 upgrade), dip and water.  The water tasted weird but I don't suspect foul play.  You know when you pull an old cup you haven't used in months out of the cupboard and if you don't rinse it, the water tastes old and weird? That's what I think happened. Even with the lemon it tastes like that.  Nothing was terrible, it was just wayy too basic. I spent $38 and the food was meh.  That's $38/$1.59 = 25.5 junior chicken sandwiches I coulda had.  Now I feel some type of way. 2 stars."}
{"text":"After work drinks, around union station, decided on Loose Moose. Took everyone quite a while to get their drinks after repeatedly being told they are out, and super slow service in between. Ordered the Sweet Potato Thing (actual name in the menu) to share and it was alright, nothing special. We were there relatively early, but started getting busy after 5pm and people were holding the doors open so cold drafts were getting in. Otherwise, nothing too special."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Loose Moose was the summer of 2008. There was a conference at the convention center and my friends and I needed an escape. We found this small bar, threw back a few Molsons and had a good time.   Fast forward to 2015. Loose Moose has DOUBLED in size. It is crazy! They are so much more busier but the waitresses are still very attentive. My favorite thing to get from them is their poutine. Parking is a bit of a hassle but there is an underground parking spot that is relatively cheap. Plus, the view of the CN tower is breathtaking too."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, had the burger and fries and the patty tasted fresh, fries were not too salty. They have a large selection of beers too. It would be nice if their food menu had a little more variety, mostly consists of burgers and sandwiches. Atmosphere is fun, gets busy on weekend or when there's a game on. The service was also a  positive, was greeted and seated quickly, the food came fast, and the waitress checked in regularly. I was a little confused as to why they took away my napkin/utensil set, I can use a fork for fries and I still need a napkin. Other than that it was a good experience, I would go again."}
{"text":"I almost rated this 1 star.  Our server was grumpy.  There's no excuse for that.  I understand that everyone has bad days but you are performing.  You need to be able to get yourself into the zone and forget everything else.  Or you need to stay home that day.  I felt like we were a pain in the ass to her.  Beers were fine.  The atmosphere was very noisy, but it's a pretty rough bar, I would think that is the norm.  Other than a catchy name I can't think of a reason I would go here again."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times for group events and a few other times for drinks and dinner. The service here is a real good winner when having to wait for a table the hostess' are very good about checking in on you and offering to get some drinks to you while you wait, also they text your cell phone when your table is ready which I thought was a effective method instead of those little disc alarm things some other places use for alerting you about your table. Lots of great beers on tap here and all of the food is very yummy and prepared perfectly. It gets real busy here at times but service dosnt seem to get slowed down too much so kudos to them. Check this place out, real nice!"}
{"text":"The food was okay....over salted and dull.  I know they want to drink more which is why they salt the hell out of the food.  I got the veggie sandwich wasn't great and my boyfriend got a salad and added shrimp to it.  The shrimp were so tiny.  The only plus was the place was close to our hotel and we could easily walk there.  I would not go out of way to go there."}
{"text":"I met up with friends for lunch on a Saturday at The Loose Moose. My friend frequents this place,and spoke of it highly. Initially, I was very impressed. They gave us a giant picnic table with a lot of space. I expected typical bar/pub fare, and it was but slightly elevated. It took me forever to commit to my food.   I ordered the Dill Encrusted Fish & Chips ( I am a sucker for dill!). It was a very generous serving of fish. There was plenty of dill,and the dill dipping sauce was my favourite part. The fries were good.  Although initially our visit started out very pleasant, I have to deduct a few stars because the quality of service really tapered off near the end of our visit. Our waitress was very nice (and certainly patient, as it took us forever to decide) but I saw less and less of her as the meal progressed (to be fair, perhaps they were understaffed).   As soon as our food came, my partner gave the tacos he ordered a hard no, he barely took 1 bite. He said it tasted \"off\". Okay that's pretty vague, but they just looked visually bad. The portion size was very small considering it was not listed as an appetizer.  It went unnoticed that his food went untouched. Nobody asked him if his food was okay.   I would return to The Loose Moose to give it a second chance, because 4 out of the 5 of us did enjoy our meal.    The parking lot next door was convenient, it was $10 an hour, or 3 hours for $15. Apparently, there is also underground parking nearby that is more reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great burger! The fries I liked a lot too. The Beautiful waitress I had was excellent. Did a great job and everything came fast. Overall very happy, might go again today. 2nd trip to the Restaurant was excellent, again I had got another beautiful waitress who was very professional, she was so helpful with every table around me. Even two older men really enjoyed having her serve them. Excellent on so many levels the food was great, the burger is so good. The beef they use is high quality. Taste is amazing. Really enjoyed coming here!!"}
{"text":"Too dark couldn't read the menu. Had to use the light on my phone. Food was decent though"}
{"text":"Not exactly the best place, but if you're looking for a pub in and around Union Station, Loose Moose is the destination...for the past..how many years? Their food is alright, but their service is pretty good.  Their All in one platter is proabaly the most notable thing to share....lots of choice of beers...I think Ill need to come here again just to experience this place on a larger scale"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place especially if you're a first time tourist looking to have a few Canadian brews because this place has an extensive collection.  The food is also very good. We ordered the jumbo wings, the black beans dip, and quesadillas and none of our choices disappointed us. Very tasty and exceeded our expectations ! The bar itself has a hip vintage character, which helps to provide a great atmosphere. Great people and great service!"}
{"text":"Just got off work eh? Cannot see the game nearby? The Loose Moose saves you  The crafty moose theme Insane beer list flows freely Keeps the huge hall loose  It is loud as fuck It is close to everything Tourist part of town  Burger was quite meh Food's better than average pubs Just better enough  {TTC: Union Station}"}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar!  Loud, busy, great music, fun staff... I had a great time!  Loose Moose is a great place to get loosy goosy!"}
{"text":"It's a nice place. Can get busy, making reservations would be wise. They have a nice drink menu with lots of local Canadian breweries. Beer is good and prices are good as well. I recommend the liberty village black blessing or unibroue la find du monde.  Both great beer selections.  I also like the number of tv screens and atmosphere. Very lively and happening place."}
{"text":"Location is great. The ambience is very welcoming. The service is very good.   Had their Woody Burger. So rich. So good. So delicious! They also have a great craft beer selection to complement any type of food you'd order. I'd highly recommend the Royal City Smoked Honey Ale, which pairs perfectly with the Woody Burger.   Definitely coming back here again for some more brews and burgers!"}
{"text":"I went to the Moose with a few friends to watch the Super Bowl a few months back and just haven't gotten around to writing a review. I could just leave it alone but it doesn't matter as I won't be going back, at least on purpose.  We arrived in plenty of time to watch the game but were told we couldn't have the prime table because of a reservation. Which was fine except the people who made the reservation, one of whom was related to a staff member, didn't show up until after the game had started. And they brought little kids with them to a loud sports bar on Super Bowl Sunday. They stayed until almost halftime, and when they left after eating SALADS we took over the table.  There was only one large TV and only a few smaller TVs, which made it hard for some to watch the game. The sound for the big TV kept going out, over and over and over again. We complained to management several times only to find out that the bar had known about the problem for a week and hadn't fixed it in time. The Super Bowl just isn't as good when you have no idea what the hell is going on.  Partway through the game a urinal in the men's room flooded over. While using the other one, it flooded again. I ended up throwing out my shoes when I got home--you can guess why. They finally put a handwritten sign over the urinal, which drunk guys would then move aside and they would flood the bathroom again. Disgusting.  The food was expensive and unremarkable. The beer special wasn't all that special. The service was decent.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here with family, they have a good menu.  Service is great (on the slow side though) and the food is very good.  I would go back."}
{"text":"I saw The Loose Moose on the map and knew I wanted to come here! I walked over after visiting the CN Tower around 1pm. I loved the warm interior above street level and all of the different beer options on tap. I sat at the bar & had a Canadian beer and watched a women's curling tournament on the big TV. The bartender offered me a menu that had some extremely appealing lunch specials listed, so I ordered the Canadian bacon BLT with poutine (duh). It came out swiftly and was really delicious. I was full of beer and couldn't finish my lunch, so they gave me a little take away container! I enjoyed my visit to The Loose Moose very much!"}
{"text":"Really good food. The Woody burger was awesome. Not kid friendly at all and the service was OK...not great. I would go back for the food and drinks. Great beer selection."}
{"text":"Great place to get a drink and a bite to eat before the game!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink. We had a blast at this place. The decor is so rad! A definite must for a quick drink and chat at the bar. Very cool vice here!  We might be back!!"}
{"text":"We had a quick lunch prior to getting ready for a Blue Jay's game.   Our group was seated right away.  It's a big place with plenty of seating and they had all the World Cup games on the TV's.  There were several birthday parties going on that afternoon.  They have a good selection of beers.  The food was ok.  I enjoyed my soup & salad and the poutine appetizer was delicious. The service was good.  This place gets crowded quickly before a Jay's game.  I would eat at the Moose again."}
{"text":"The Loose Moose is a popular sports bar right across the street from the Metro Toronto Convention Centre. It becomes all the more popular during Leafs and Jays games because of its proximity to the Rogers Centre. The place itself is a 2 floor restaurant/bar with a basement/cellar that is just a cool as the top floor.   People come for the beers and drinks, as they have one of the largest selections of draught beers in downtown. I had to have some food before the Jays game, so we shared a pair of apps. Fish tacos and pork belly sliders sound good enough. The crispy haddock used in the fish tacos were very good, while the cabbage slaw added the bit of crunch to pair with the softness of the corn tortilla. The pork belly sliders were good but so damn greasy. Every bite we took had oil dripping so that wasn't the greatest. The pork belly was very tasty though and the buns were buttered too.   The place gets absolutely packed during game days and the environment is great because everyone is all pumped and excited (and not yet drunk). The wait for tables can be long, but there are usually spots at the bar that open up if you don't care."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since the 1990s. It's nice to see they're preserving their tradition of dog slow service. How long does it really take to pour two beers?   I had the sourdough bread burger. I assumed by \"bread\" they meant \"bun\". No. It comes on two slices of wonder bread like bread. Meh. Not impressive.   The saving grace of this place is they have a pretty nice list of craft beers on tap. Something like 20. If you're looking for a place for a decent beer near the Skydome, this isn't a bad place. Just don't come here for a decent burger."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before Raptors and Jays games... The Loose Moose -- it is what it is. The location makes it a logical spot to hit up before or after a game. They have one of those confusing multi-screened televisions as the main focus behind the bar. Lots of televisions around but most are pretty old tube versions and the picture is a little dodgy. I came here once during the first round of the NHL playoffs and was shocked that all their TVs were playing the second-last Raptors game of the season. I understand loyalty to Toronto teams, but come on!  Most of the waitresses here appear to be around the 19-22 age range. The last time I came here we sat down and ordered a drink and they hadn't shown up after a good 10 minutes. Could have easily walked the 10 foot distance between our table and the bar and got them myself. I've had some waitresses that seem to be totally on point though.  The place is pretty huge. They have a ton of seating towards the back that have personal televisions, so I would think you could watch whatever you please while eating, though I've never ate here. The music they play is God awful, including all the Top 40 rubbish you can handle.  Again, it is what it is: a sports bar on Front Street."}
{"text":"Great experience at this fun, lively pub style restaurant and bar. Awesome beer and cocktail selection. Wonderful service and the best Poutine I've ever had. Generous dinner portions at inexpensive prices.  Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Boston and we chose this place based on it being close to our hotel. Good food, good drinks and a reasonable price. My only complaint is that it is incredibly loud. Hard to hear what the person next to you is saying. I would come back again if I'm ever in the area."}
{"text":"Located across the street from the Fairmont Royal York. This is a great place for Beers and Pub food. Meals are a good size, service is quick. This place can be quite busy and noisy though. Still a good place to dine & drink."}
{"text":"Service is incredibly slow. The food is not much better. So to start I asked for a bowl of tomato soup. Sounds good right? Well I'm almost positive the chefs grabbed some ragu from the back and called it tomato soup. So then I asked for some chips and guacamole because like most people, I'm not fond of eating Ragu. It took 27 minutes and 53 seconds to get a bowl of chips...if you think that is bad my son waiting 35 minutes for a sprite. The building is empty and between my son asking for a sprite and when he finally got one, I think my waitress quit her job and applied for three new ones it took that long. For the rest of the \"meal\" I never saw her again. I did see someone get up and go to a supply cart to get their own salt because, like ours, their waitress was nonexistent. Awful restaurant, they did a really great job of making us want to leave but we couldn't get a check so I'm probably still sitting here as you read this......"}
{"text":"If you like Leafs hockey, firstly, I'm sorry.  Secondly, there's a great place to go watch the games if you aren't a) a season ticket holder, b) able to afford scalped tickets, c) a guy in a suit that doesn't normally watch hockey but has a client with tickets that are on the visiting team's bench.  The Loose Moose is Leafs or for that matter Raptors central as the bar is walking distance to the home of both teams, the ACC.  This is a sports bar pure and simple.  Do not expect quiet meals to be had here.  It's not a place for conversation; it is here for one sole purpose.  You come in, you eat, you drink, you scream at the myriad television sets that dot the bar.  During intermissions they invite any and all women to stand up on the main bar, remove their bras and hang them from the pole that is suspended from the ceiling where the bras remain indefinitely.  So, bring the missus.  Or not, if she's not into that.  And if she's not, don't tell her that sort of thing goes on.  But if you do, act as shocked as her.  During playoff times, the Moose's investment in the NHL package pays dividends as you're able to watch any game you want which is excellent news for visitors out of town who want to watch their local team from back home.  Of course you only get the audio for the Leafs if they're playing but a) at least you get to see your playoff match-up between Minnesota and Nashville, and b) becauseit's the Leafs, you won't need to worry about the noise of their play-off run interrupting you.  The pitchers and wings come highly recommended."}
{"text":"So this is definitely a 4-5 star place to drink beer and have plenty of seats to choose from and about a three star for the food so rounding up to 4 because the beer selection is quite impressive and the service was spot on.   They have a very large bar that even juts out in a section to fit even more seats kind of lock a strip club stage...so I've heard. They also have some very large table so large groups are not a problem.   The food on the other hand was disappointing and for one common reason. The French fries simply under cooked in the middle and not crispy. It seems like they forgot about the par cooking part and just hit them with the high heat.   My colleague and I shared the buffalo chicken poutine. It was pretty good but neither of us could really eat the fries. My entree was the fish and chips. Fish had a panko type crust where I'd normally prefer a light batter but it worked and was tasty. The \"chips\" on the other hand had the same problem. Ate half of one. Get a new fry cook and this place will be legit."}
{"text":"Not your regular downtown dive. This one has got it all. Tons of beer options. Any type of drink you can imagine. A pretty good menu. TVs on every wall. If you want to pass on the real sports bar, this is a more local alternative. You get a lot of hardcore fans here. If you are looking for a rare craft beer, this place may have it. This is one of my favorite places to watch football in the city."}
{"text":"Lots of taps, some craft, some not.. I've been here before when they have the 'Tap Takeover' where a specific brewery hooks them up with a bunch that are not the normal fare -- look out for it!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine what the lease on the place is, but I don't think it'd be an exaggeration to estimate it's one of the most expensive restaurant rents in the city. This place is in the prime of prime locations: Right down the street from the SkyDome (I still call it that!), and they don't waste that privilege.   Boasting a serving staff of what can safely be described as some of Toronto's best looking women, the Loose Moose is a atmosphere of high ceilings and loft like architecture that also happens to serve some pretty damn good food. A great place to bring the gang before you head off to the Jays game or show at the 'Dome, the Moose has a well appointed bar that must be about 50 feet long, tons of TV's, high top tables and lots of views of Front Street or the surrounding area. Service is quick and friendly, and the food is some of the better food you'll get in the area, without the prices being totally over inflated. Large washrooms keep the lineups non-existent on the aforementioned game days, and the place is not crowded, even when it is.  Have had the Fish and Chips, burger with salad and with fries, and wings. All the food is top quality. I've never gotten bad food here.   Worth the trip! Come check it out!"}
{"text":"Great place! Food is delish, and not pricey and they have a wide variety of beers and drinks.  The atmosphere is great and so is the service.  I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went here after dinner because of a recommendation from the waitress at the Chophouse nearby. We asked for craft local beers and this was a great spot. Walking in, it really looks like a regular bar back in the states- just the regular sports bar. But this was better.   We sat up at the bar and went for Mill St. brews. The bartenders were friendly and ended up letting us sample many of the other beers they offered since they discovered our interest in local Toronto beers. I can't remember exactly what we sampled, but we had tried at least 4 different beers. Nice to go to a sports bar where the bartenders actually know the beer really well and they serve more than just budweiser and miller light."}
{"text":"Busy place! Fast service - food was great with good size portions. Very convenient because it is so close to the Rogers Centre - I would come again."}
{"text":"Kew place. Kew staff. Good to watch games. Good food. Gets pretty busy but still plenty of seats. Beer is pricey but so is everything I'm down downtown Toronto. Buzzing pretty hard right now. Staff is still nice. Came here multiple times on this trip. Will come again. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I really like the Loose Moose for a casual beer or dinner. It has typical pub food, nothing too special but pretty good. Big beer selection which is great, and I love that you can get flights of beer to taste a few different ones."}
{"text":"A friend of mine actually works here, but other than that (or to watch a hockey game) I don't know that it'd go here that often.  It's a great place if you're a jock, looking for a place to hang out with other jocks and talk about jock-things. Especially the basement. Lots of jocks down there.  Oh and speaking of jocks (the undergarment type), the downstairs also features a row of hanging bras. So ladies! If you're looking for a good place to recycle? There you go. Also, ladies, if you're looking for a jock-y man (and some of us are, if even for one night) THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO."}
{"text":"After a photography walk around Toronto, my buddy and myself decided to try \"The Loose Moose\". The atmosphere was great, good crowd, sports on tv, friendly staff and great ambience.  The food in the menu had some great choices and affordable prices too. I got the poutine and that filled me up! It was loaded with bacon, sour cream and green onion. Also, they didn't cheap out on the gravy. It was delicious and is enough reason to come back to get the same order again.  The reason for the 4 star was that out waitress took a really long time to get our bill. However, she was nice and friendly and served us really well. This situation is not enough to make us not want to come back. We will return and try more of deliciousness that they served us and hopefully that next time it will be just as good.  Definitely recommend this place to others. You guys will love it!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go and grab a beer, meet friends, and truly have an enjoyable time, and when I went today I can honestly say that feeling did not change one bit.  I met a friend quickly for a beer and a bit of food here today and was not disappointed by either. We both got an innis and gunn on tap, and if you haven't tried it I suggest you should. A bit darker with a rum infused hoppy taste it is wonderful with most bar food.  The service was quick and attentive, however we both found out bartender maybe a bit abrasive? Maybe her shift was almost over and she wanted to leave, not poor service, just seemed like maybe she had an off day.  My friend had the 5 alarm wings and I had the shrimp lettuce wraps as well as the goat cheese chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. My friend said that his wings were warm, tasty, but admittedly not enough seeing as they only come with 8, but this is the same everywhere.  The shrimp lettuce wraps were full of flavour and nice build it yourself, definitely good for two people. My sandwich was delicious, however I found the bun  a bit hard for my liking. The sweet potato fries were sweet potato fries, not much to say about them.  Overall I'd suggest coming here for a good beer since there are over 100 on tap, a nice appetizer, but if you're looking for a finer dining is search elsewhere, good for a boys night or a casual meal."}
{"text":"Massive drink menu with a great, bustling atmosphere. Servers are nice. The food, although above average when compared against pub standards, is still only just decent at best. But the menu offerings (in terms of variety) are nice and far from your typical pub fare, so it's nice to see them shaking things up a bit. I tried the mac and grilled cheese -- interesting idea, but a bit disappointing in execution. It wasn't the most flavourful and I probably wouldn't have it again if I came back."}
{"text":"So many good beers on tap, good food, good portions, good service, good atmosphere... Nothing stood out as amazing but everything was solid, at a place I expected (based on the location) would be a lame tourist trap."}
{"text":"The Loose Moose is in very close proximity to the ACC and Rogers Centre, so add this to your list if you're heading to an event at either location.  This place has a world-class beer list, great interior, and seriously good bar food. I'm not expecting a lot when I come to a place like this, but everything was top-notch. The beer was cold and quick, service attentive, and food definitely better than the average sports bar.   I had - are you ready for this - a mac & cheese grilled cheese. This was indeed a panini with mac and cheese inside. It had a mix of cheeses which really helped to avoid the boring factor. My husband always has the dill fish fry and talks about it for days after. The dill flavor really comes through in the breading, which is crispy without being oily.   As noted in other reviews, this place is nearly always incredibly busy. If you're coming with a large group (they nicely accommodate with large tables) make a reservation - especially on a game night. Do note that they do check ID at the door on weekends after 7pm (in my experience).  The Loose Moose is a great place to have on your list of standards - and awesome for the beer list alone."}
{"text":"Being from the U.S., I get overly excited about seeing anything moose-related when I'm in Canada, so imagine my delight when I walked past The Loose Moose!!  So imagine my further surprise when my Managing Director asked if I wanted to try The Loose Moose after our trade show!   Inside there's this really, really cool light fixture made up of empty tequila and beer bottles that spans the length of the bar.  Whoever came up with that is a genius.  We ordered wings and calamari for starters, and both were pretty standard.  The steak frites set the restaurant apart.  I only had one minor complaint-- the steak was served over a bed of fries on top of wax paper.  I would have preferred a plate, as it was very hard cutting the steak without also ripping the wax paper, and some of the fries became soggy.  Generally, I'm very skeptical of steak in restaurants such as the Loose Moose.  Usually I find the meat quality lacking, the steak cooked unevenly, and the seasoning under or over-done.  At The Loose Moose, there are no such problems.  I was surprised by the evenness of the cooking, and how perfectly the espresso rub complemented the steak.  And all for a very reasonable price.  Bravo LOOSE MOOSE!"}
{"text":"Visited here on a Thurs. night while on a business trip.  Great waitress, great local Beau's beer & appetizers were delish!  Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Loose Moose before going to a concert at the ACC.   Live entertainment and high top seating plus a lot of seating upstairs and downstairs. Service was average but luckily had a good server who was chatty and friendly with my friend and I.   The best part of this pub - the beer selection. There are definitely more than the average beers here. They offer pint size (18oz), mini pitcher (32oz) and pitcher 60oz).  Ordered the Grilled Cheese and The Pig & the Egg. Grilled cheese was tasty as it had macaroni inside smothered with melted mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Very filling but delicious. Fries were average - nothing to rave about.   The Pig & the Egg - it was huge. Very filling and mixed with different flavors from the cheese to bacon and the fried avocado. It is a unique but delicious combination.   I wouldn't mind coming back to enjoy the atmosphere with a couple of beers and good company."}
{"text":"Service is good and waiters/waitresses are nice too. Food is great. I definitely recommend it to everyone. It's such a great sports bar!"}
{"text":"The online reservation system was super easy and convenient. I found the service to be very attentive as well. I ordered the Herbivore sandwich and the creamy goat cheese and spicy kick too this veggie sandwich to the next level. The restaurant is quite loud which made it hard to talk. I feel like they could wait til later in the evening to turn up the music - but maybe I'm just old! My only other complaint was that the menu did not have the nutritional information on it."}
{"text":"It used to be one of my favourite pubs in Toronto. Thus, I invited 3 of my friends to join me and check it out. The four of us walk in and the short, blonde hostess[Blondie] takes us all the way back to sit on super low couches, even though there was a free table in the front. Since we wanted to eat, my friend went back to nicely ask for a table, since the couches were to low for us to eat properly. And guess what she hears? Blondie - forgot her name- was gossip about us with one of the waitresses - a nice waitress btw, she's been nice every single time I went there. The waitress asked why she put us all the way in the back and Blondie said \"Did you see how they look? They are not dressed properly for the front table. Do you wanna serve them?\" Excuse us, sunshine! We didn't know Loose Moose was a tie and suit kind of pub! What's wrong with jeans and shirts? Or maybe you just found us ugly. Either way, not a nice thing to say about your customers...  We did end up at the front table and had a goodish experience. However, I'm still annoyed with Blondie and her reason for hiding us.   Not sure when or if I'll be back. We'll see."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for people who take the train to watch the games! One block from Union station, Air Canada Center and very close to Rogers center as well! The ambiance of the place is great for a post game hang out session. There is live music at the bottom which can be very noisy. I prefer upstairs because you are able to carry on a conversation without screaming. Every time I have been here , its been packed!    I had the garlic fries here the first time, which were very garlicky (duh!) and greasy but good too! Not a good option if you want to meet new people! I was with friends so it was ok! Second time around I had the vegetable quesadilla which was very good and appropriate to eat if you plan on flirting later.  They also have the games playing on the tvs."}
{"text":"Fun, especially before/ after a Jays game. Gets packed. I haven't eaten there but it's always a fun atmosphere"}
{"text":"This place is a bar with appetizer size meals and big platter prices. I'm traveling from zither USA and stopped to check it out but was very disappointed!!!!  . TOURIST BE WARE"}
{"text":"This was a light dinner tonite cause I was coming off a trade show & I was tired. I decided to go light cause I didn't was to go to sleep \"full\". Our waitress was \"Sahara\". She was a polite & delightful young lady that treated us like she wanted to serve, nice to see. I went with the the tomato bisque soup (which Sahara recommended) which was creamy, hot & delicious. I also choose a Chicken Cob Salad (Blue Cheese w Avocado) which was pretty good but unfulfilling (not the foods fault). I give this restaurant a 4-star cause the food was good & the service was very good."}
{"text":"3 stars for the food, but 2 stars for the service.   I've come here twice now, and overall both experiences have been quote good. Most recently, I came here on a Saturday night with some friends to have some beer and wings while watching the NBA All Star Dunk Contest.   The Nachos were tasty! - super loaded with cheese, the selection of Craft Beers was great!, and the Chicken Wings were delicious!   The only gripe I have is that the service was not great, it was honestly really hard to get a hold of our server, and when we did, she often forgot items. In addition to that, we had a secondary server who actually brought us our drinks, so it was a bit confusing who to ask for what.   The most frustrating part, was that since we had a party of 8 , we had an automatic gratuity, which is normally fine, but when your service is poor, it's hard to accept that you're giving a decent tip for a below average service."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and bartenders.  We had a lot of drinks and the wanted something in our stomachs so we ordered some poutin.  Yummy! Fun place... Would return."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for after work drinks.. The food and drinks here are delicious.. Notably the \"sweet potato thing\"  and Ceasars!   The environment is great, convenient to hang out before or after a game or concert at the ACC or Rogers Centre.. Tons of tvs all around. The service here is quite slow though, do not recommend this place of you are ever in a rush."}
{"text":"We're from America and we're looking for a good place to eat and this place met every expectation.  The atmosphere is so unique and fun and Katherine, our server, was so friendly and willing to make every meal request work and you could tell her and the rest of the servers were working extremely hard. We're planning on going back tomorrow to get a tshirt we loved this place so much."}
{"text":"I used to hang out here when I was in university (wont say how many years ago it was... but it was enough) and wow has this place changed!  I will right now - the only reason I didnt give them a 5 is noise level.  The music is so loud everyone has to shout to be heard at their tables - which just increases the overall noise level. When your waitress cant hear you when she is standing right in front of you - its a problem.  Ok now that that is out of the way - onto the good stuff:  Food: 5 out of 5 We were a large group so got to try tons - my favorites?    The coney dogs on a stick with homemade ketchup and some sweet/spicy mustard that was heaven!  The jalepeno cornbread around the hot dog was just the right amount of flavour without any real heat.  Any come one - who doesnt love food on a stick? Just makes everything taste better!   The other big hit was the salted caramel, bacon dusted mini donots. Think Tiny Toms on steroids!  The combo may sound daunting but I promise you its worth every calorie. You get a giant bowl of them so be prepared to share - otherwise you might end up in a sugar coma.  The nachos were great - huge portion too (hard to mess up nachos). The garlic fries are just that - garlic!  Might be the lowest point on the food scale - but still yummy. And again super large portion!  But the real reason to go to the Loose Moose is not the food - its the BEER! They have a significant range of craft beers - in bottles, on tap, and cask specials.  For everything (except the bottles) you can chose pints, half pints or 3oz tasters.  I highly recommend going in and doing taste flights (3-5 of the 3oz tasters) to figure out your style - and because its fun!    We were a large group and pretty loud - but our waitress handled us all with style and grace, never once messing up a drink order (and constantly kept them coming!).  She deserves a medal (and maybe a raise?).  Hard to find service like we had.    Also had a ton of fun tweeting with whoever manages the @loosemooseto twitter account!  Overall this is just a really fun place, with great food, great drinks and great service. Cant go wrong here folks! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This seems like a decent sports bar.  The menu is pretty safe and there are maybe 10 beers on tap.  My pastrami sandwich was OK, the coleslaw and cornbread were mostly flavorless, but the fresh garden salad was way better than I expected.  My bartender, John, was great and I really appreciated that they carry Setanta on their television lineup."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar but apart from that it's fine.  I love the ceiling sculpture made from bottles!  They have a good range of craft beers, the wings are of the breaded kind, which normally I don't like, but these are actually good, especially in the 5 chilli style.  The fries are very good if you like the Canadian skin on Yukon Gold type and if you like them, ask for mayonnaise, it's so much better than ketchup."}
{"text":"Good food - casual at atmosphere right across from the convention center.  The service was good - server was very friendly.   The food was good - nothing earth shattering but way better than convention food."}
{"text":"I'm shocked the reviews aren't better. I absolutely loved this place. Great atmosphere, cool decor, great seating arrangements. Service was friendly and the beer selection was amazing. You can order a 1.5 oz and try all kinds. But what gives this the 5 star is I accidentally ordered something that I didn't realize I was ordering that was one of the best things I have ever tasted. I thought I was ordering grilled cheese and macaroni and cheese. What it was, was a grilled macaroni and cheese sandwich and it was so good, I may go back to toronto just to eat it again. I'm not even kidding."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of beer and food is good pub grub. The staff we had was friendly and knowledgable about the craft beer we were sampling. They have 3oz samples of their draft available which is a great choice before you commit to a full glass."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Had the fish and chips.  Quite noisy but that's what you get pre BlueJays game.  Service was just ok but it was fairly busy."}
{"text":"I ordered a pint of Strongbow ($7.49), poutine ($9.50), and avocado sandwich with a side salad ($12.95). The total including tax came to $33.84. The poutine was delicious, and the avocado sandwich was pretty good. You could probably just order the poutine by itself because it was so big. Even though I shared the poutine with three others, I could only eat half of my sandwich. I wish there had been a half-sized portion for the sandwich.  I write \"A-OK\" because I didn't like how we were sitting with other people at the same table. I realize we entered during the 3rd place world cup match, but it just seemed so odd to sit with complete strangers. They were friendly, but if you're having a conversation, be forewarned other people might butt into your conversation. If you don't want this, don't come here!"}
{"text":"TLM is your very typical icky pub in downtown Toronto. I didn't enjoy too many things here.   The only upside is, they do have quite a big menu to choose from. But on the other hand, the food tasted a lot worse than your average bar food. Nachos were not cheesy enough and the wings were super victoria's secret boney.  On the night I went, about 60% of the people were watching hockey and the rest were watching NBA - not sure how it was in any way justifiable to turn on HALF of the left side of the small tvs for NBA - that's about 15% of the tv (by screen size), and they were not the large ones on the right side of the pub).  Service was slow, and they seated us right in front of the door in the middle of winter (why do they even try to seat people there??)"}
{"text":"I was a fan! Food was good, drinks were stiff, waitress was attentive. I'd come here again."}
{"text":"Stopped here because it was near our hotel. We really enjoyed the food. I know it's weird, but the fries with the sandwich were probably the best I've had in a while. Service was quick and attentive. It wasn't really my scene, but it was a great meal."}
{"text":"After Gord and I left the Toronto Rock game this afternoon, we walked to the Loose Moose.  It was fairly busy and we were seated at a long communal table with some others.  We were feeling a bit snacky.  I ordered Jerk Dark Rum wings (eight for $12).  They were good ... sweet with a kick of heat.  Gord ordered fish tacos and liked them.  Caylene was our server and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Awesome sports bar right near the arena. We were in town for the Miami Heat Toronto Raptors game on Friday and decided to stop by here before the game. There are a ton or beers to choose from and everything we ordered to eat was very good. The service was quick as well. There was a long wait, but that is to be expected when there is a game. I'd recommend this place to anyone wanting to grab a beer before or after a basketball or hockey game. We would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here after checking out the aquarium. A bunch of coworkers checked out the Raptor game ad dropped in and I followed suit.  Nachos were great and so was the service. I like the decor and the ambiance they've created here. I can't really put my finger on it or describe it but I'm definitely coming back here to hang out."}
{"text":"Buffalo Chicken waffle sandwich!! :) I am a sucker for buffalo chicken, and this was in a sandwich where it was waffles instead of bread. AMAZING! :)  Lots of TVs and we were seated quick. Served pretty quick too. Pretty good beer selection, and the sandwich was sooo gooood! Not as good as Real Sports', but definitely a close second! Lots of local beer, including Mill Street on tap. My Dad had the fish and chips, which he inhaled. No complaints on his end! Pretty expensive ($2 more) for onion rings, so opted for the salad substitute.  Definitely gonna check this place out more often before Jays games, but can't cheat on Real Sports (too much...haha)"}
{"text":"My most recent visit here was during the big Toronto power outage this winter. Now, I normally wouldn't have picked this place for food but my friend and I had tickets to the Yeezus concert at the ACC and needed a quick bite beforehand.  I didn't expect there to be a lot of patrons but it was incredibly busy. We were seated at a communal table within very close proximity to a couple that looked on the verge of breaking up right there. They remarked on how good the Caesars were and just stopped talking after that. It was way too awkward and strengthened my everlasting hate of communal tables. The noise was almost unbearable and to have a conversation, you had to yell.  Their beer list is extensive though you're definitely getting robbed from the high prices, even for a domestic beer. We ordered pesto fries and bacon focaccia sliders which were again overpriced and on par with Jackastor's quality of food. I know they're both within the same corporation but the food at Loose Moose was just like Jack's but with a higher price. Service here was S L O W and probably the slowest service I've ever experienced. At one point, we actually thought of just paying for the beers and then leaving because it didn't seem like the food would ever come to our table and we needed to make it to our concert.  I actually think I'm being generous by giving 2 stars."}
{"text":"Had the Poutine. Excellent.  My husband loved the fish tacos and the salted Carmel bacon donuts did not disappoint.  Totally great bar food"}
{"text":"THIS RESTAURANT HAS COCKROACHES!  My girlfriend and I decided to go to the Loose Moose to catch the Maple Leafs game.   We were seated quickly and were offered a drink by a less than enthusiastic waiter. Our beers came pretty fast, and then we ordered the veggie nachos and fish tacos.   The nachos were good, the fish tacos tasted good but were a little on the small side.   We ordered another beer and this is where the problems started.   I noticed something moving out of the corner of my eye, looked over and there was a COCKROACH crawling on the wall. I was very grossed out, but thought that perhaps it was a one time thing because the place doesn't \"look\" dirty at all. A few minutes later, I spotted a roach again, and then again, and then one more time before I got fed up and made a complaint to the waitress. She assured me that in her two years, she had never seen anything or heard of any bugs in the restaurant, but she would let the manager know.   As I went to take a drink of my beer, I noticed that there was fly in my drink, which normally I would have probably let go, but with the cockroach incident and then this, I made a complaint again.   The manager came over and offered me a free beer, which I took. He offered my girlfriend a beer as well (but when the bill came, they actually charged us for it).    ** Follow Up ** I asked someone that I know who used to work at the Loose Moose, and they told me that it is well known among the employees there that they have a cockroach problem, and that the management doesn't seem to care about doing anything.   The food was fine, the beer list was extensive, however the bug problem destroys this restaurant. I would advise that you don't go there, unless you are okay with cockroaches crawling around your dining area."}
{"text":"service is not that great...they are quite slow  the food is good but over priced...i really like the specialty beers on tap"}
{"text":"Went with a group of 5 before a Toronto Rock game so it was pretty busy.  The server was a bit overwhelmed and told us the kitchen was behind.  This led to two of us getting really cold food.  However despite those cons the server was friendly and the food was really good (just cold).  I had the crispy lasagna which was a fun and tasty take on a classic.  Definitely will go back but hopefully to warmwr food!"}
{"text":"decent food, nothing to write home about.    Had a wide selection of tap beers and bottles also.    Its expensive because the location is so close to ACC and Skydome.  Might comeback before a game."}
{"text":"My buddies and I like to go to this bar to watch Leaf games.  It gets really packed just before and after games (with people who are lucky enough to be GOING to them), so just a heads-up to maybe wait until it's close to game time if you're hoping to get a seat.  We love the atmosphere here when there's a game on, probably wouldn't come otherwise.  They've got a big projector screen that they pull down which is sweet, and a bunch of smaller TVs around the bar.  As far as the food goes, it's pretty good and the portions are huge!!  I recommend the buffalo chicken sandwich on a waffle.  Yeah, you heard me - on a waffle.  It sounds crazy I know (which is why I had to try it), but it's awesome!!  The sweet potato fries are a solid choice too.  I don't know what they season them with, but it's amazing - and I could drink the dipping sauce they serve with it.  The service really is hit or miss, and it's not necessarily due to how crowded it is either.  When it is really crowded, you can usually expect your service to be slow.  I have, however, been in on slow nights and had even slower service.  For me though, I'm just there to have a couple beers with my buddies and watch a game - so I don't let it get to me."}
{"text":"It was loud!  A blue jay game was still on!!  They had a band playing and the raido also.  (I say play one not both)   A member boked a table and it was hold for us!  Thanks Server came to our table and asked for drinks and later on for food.  About he same as another place down town!  She did not coem to our table to much so i would say it was a negative...    It was a nice day so they let the window open and that was a Pluse! NOTE theri had security at the front door and they were checking bags!   FOOD was hot i have to give them that!   Used theri washroom and it was ok but could use a bit more work!!    Would i go back no i left with a head ack!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here.  Got food poisoning today from a burger.  The only thing I ate today.  Still suffering now at 9pm.  Should be 0 stars.  Service was horrible also.  DON'T EAT HERE."}
{"text":"Went to this resturaunt  today, food wasn't bad, slow start,  and moderate service.   I ordered the chicken club house, which contained your normal club sandwich ingredients, and a very tender chicken breast served on a nice crunchy bun. The ribs which my uncle ordered, were okay. I had a taste. But, a little too pricey for what we were getting. The pulled pork pouting was enjoying until we got to the bottom, which was very very salty. However, the  ceaser salad was way to creamy. It was not edible.   The service was okay. Moreover, your typical bar place, not recommended for dinner."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for \"dinner\", which for us consisted of a bunch of appetizers to get a feel for the place.   Overall first impression was that the Loose Moose is a typical pub with a cool name and some neat decor. For sports fans, this is obviously a great place to catch a game of any kind as they have a plethora of tvs. It's also pretty noisy and busy, seems like a good place to drink with friends.   We ordered potato skins, calamari, garlic cheese bread and honey garlic wings. Didn't take too long for our order to come out but when it did it was piping hot and nicely presented. Wings were good, garlic cheese bread was great (served in a way that's easy for sharing and with super yummy garlicky butter topping), calamari was good, lightly battered and fresh and potato skins, which weren't anything special (or very good in my opinion).  I only gave this place a two because for standard pub fare, it was just standard. I could go to any firkin style pub and get food just as good. We will go back and try some of their sandwiches to get a better feel for how good the food is next time."}
{"text":"Service was great... food was ok.  Nice hang out before catching a game.  Conveniently located by Air Canada Center."}
{"text":"Very expensive.  But you know you'll be paying a premium based on the location.  You basically know you will be overcharged before you walk in, so don't be mad when you end up paying about $15 (after taxes are included to be fair) for 3 tacos the size a stick of juicy fruit gum.  The burgers seem to be the most fairly priced menu items (from a \"you get what you pay for\" perspective).  I had one of the burgers, and it was quite good.  The service was also fine.    An issue I have with this place is the fact that they add an automatic 18% gratuity on your bill if you are in a large group (even if they are separate). I know a lot of places do this,  but this is still a real dick policy.  I usually tip 20%, so it actually does me a favour.  Overall, a nice place though."}
{"text":"If not for it's proximity to the Rogers Centre/ACC and just plain being smack downtown (not to mention the awesome beer list) this place would fail miserably based on service alone! I'm a bartender and I was absolutely astounded that you could have so many people behind the bar yet practically have to shoot a flare for a beer. I remember going to this place for years and never having such crap service as I did in my most recent visit. I asked someone for a beer only to have her tell me to wait, she served someone else then proceeded to talk to one of her fellow employees. I asked someone else for a beer and the keg ran out, she looked at me and shrugged and proceeded to serve someone else.  The only thing I managed to get when I asked was the bill. NEVER going back!!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Thursday late night. There was no live music going on which was a bummer. The place is huge! with it being later in the night it wasn't overly busy. We sat at the bar to have some drinks. The beer list is massive with lots of choices. The bartender was very knowledgeable and happy to give suggestions. we didn't have any food as we already ate before getting there. A great, chill place to hangout and have a drink with friends."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer and great burger!   Good friendly team service.   Good Bar TV's."}
{"text":"Chicken nachos were delicious  nice friendly pub prices very reasonable. I would highly recommend you give it a try you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"If you're traveling out of the States and still want to feel at home - then the Loose Moose is for you. Thought they would add a little Canadian \"flare\" to the mix. But I found none. That said, the food was good and the service was welcoming. Unfortunately the place is just right out of the USA handbook of Restaurants 101."}
{"text":"My wife and I spent the weekend in Toronto and this was our first stop for food once we got into the city.  It was just a short walk from our condo and the name itself had us sold.  Wait time on a Friday night wasn't too bad at all and it was surprisingly big inside.  We grabbed a drink at the bar while waiting with several TVs to view. I ordered a burger topped with brisket which was amazing.  I almost always order western style (bbq, bacon, onion rings, etc) burgers and they had one on the menu but I am so glad I opted to go with the brisket burger instead.  They had a great beer list with plenty of options to choose from.  I'd definitely try this place again based on the burger experience alone."}
{"text":"Came here for NYE & ate at the bar! Bartenders are really attentive in terms of filling our water and getting us drinks and putting in our orders! I love that! Basic service that so many places out there does not even meet this minimum requirement!  We ordered the haddock tacos and dirty bird! This place is also related to Dukes refresher on Gerrard! A huge beer menu, lots of craft beer!   The fish taco was AMAZING! All the flavours, spiciness of the sauce, tango was of the coleslaw mixed together just explodes in ur mouth!   The dirty bird was also incredible, deep fried chicken was delish!! So tender and juicy and the batter was similar to southern chicken! All that was missing was waffles!   The finale was the donuts with bacon, no words to describe the yumminess of the whole sweet and savoury!!  Will definitely be back to try the other tacos and 20 something craft beer we have yet to try!"}
{"text":"I went to the Loose Moose with my brother and my son before attending an event at the Air Canada Center. I had a burger and it was pretty good. My son had chicken fingers and was also very pleased with his serving.  Waitresses were kind and came back to check on us often. It was a very pleasant dining experience and I will not hesitate to try them again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Worth a visit for Canadian draft beer selection and live music. Wouldn't call it a sports bar but they do have big screen tvs set to games. Food was okay. Good spot to grab a drink with friends and enjoy some local bands (music started around 9 when I visited)."}
{"text":"Horrible wi-fi, fries tasted like they were from under the fryer.  Staff nice but slow."}
{"text":"Decent beer selection.  Wings took forever to come and were a bit small.."}
{"text":"This place only got 2 stars because the layout of the place is very nice.  Hostess was rude Waitress was rude  Got nachos & garlic fries - sucked, no flavour and soggy.   Wouldn't go back there, and wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I really want to give them a 3.5. Great Beer selection and was impressed that the waitress was helpful and knowledgeable. The service was okay as well. The food is basically good bar food. I had the brats and they were excellent. I also got the garlic fries. They sounded great and had a decent taste. Well the ones that weren't soggy. This is my reason for a lower score. They really could have been executed better."}
{"text":"The burgers are probably the best burgers I've ever had and maybe the BEST BURGERS IN TORONTO. The burgers are so juicy and the bread to meat ratio is on point.Bun is soft and buttery. Cute atmosphere very male Canadian lol. HOWEVER THE MUSIC IS SO SHIT! You will be deaf by the time you leave this place. The music drives customers away. We left early because of the TERRIBLE TERRIBLE HORRIFIC VOMITROCIOUS MOST ANNOYING MUSIC!!!"}
{"text":"I honestly thought that this place would be like those silly chain sports bars with bad food and obnoxious crowds. But even on a Jay's game day this place had good atmosphere. Petite, gorgeous waitresses serving shitty food is the usual fare at places like these - but here you get good food too! Unfortunately, they were out of my top two choices of beer :(  I ordered the fried chicken with fries and my guy ordered the fish and chips. Wow! The fried chicken was a 1/2 chicken cooked PERFECTLY. The only other place I had such delicious fried chicken was La Mesa. My guy enjoyed his order and I was so stuffed (unheard of) that I let him have 1/4 of my chicken. It was so crispy, not at all greasy and perfectly moist inside.  The women's washroom is so cute and well decorated but their doors need a little work. I managed to lock myself into the last stall and had to shoulder the door open. Maybe I'm just an idiot though.   The total came to around $41 for two entrees and two beers - spectacular! I want to go back and hopefully they won't be out of Dieu de Ciel!"}
{"text":"This place was okay. Was a pretty good place to hang out with my friends before the Blue Jays game. Service was meh - it was sorta busy (but not \"that\" busy) and we only saw the server when she took our order and delivered food, and that was it. Food was okay. I shared the sweet potato fling with everyone - there were too many large clumps (wasn't really \"fry\" like) which didn't have much flavour and lots of burnt fries. I also shared the bean and corn quesadilla, which was really good. Great atmosphere with interesting decor (I guess it can be described as vintage sports or something lol). Might come back to give it another shot, but would definitely need to change my food order next time to something different."}
{"text":"Really great bar and grill. Nice beer selection and they have a special drink menu that had some fun things on it. I was in for lunch and did the cheese burger. The bun was grilled and the burger had a great \"grilled\" taste. Service was wonderful and friendly. I was tight in time and managed to get I. And out quickly."}
{"text":"Nice large place, it would be nice to have a christmas party here actually. That's what my work did a couple years ago. But yes I took my friend out here for a day downtown for her birthday and she had a great time. And it's also very convenient being near Union."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks before a basketball game, and I can't really figure out why this place is popular.  Or is it even?  There weren't many people there when I was there, it was almost empty.  The place is a dive imo.  Dirty dark place.  I can see it being popular with university students.  But I'm past that stage in life.  My conclusion, skip this place and go to Jack Astors which is 10x better.    Derek"}
{"text":"My parents were in town from Texas and dad needed a sports bar to keep up with his Patriots. I liked the name of this place, so without me really reading the yelp reviews (I know, I know....) we went in. Dad requested to sit somewhere with a view of the Patriot's game, and they put us in a pretty inconvenient spot to see the game, so we were 'those guys' and asked to move. They move us, we're happy, things are going well. My beer shows up and I have a drink. I noticed a suspicious bubble floating in my drink and pulled it out with a fork. Mold. Mold in my beer. Gross. I send it back and get a bottled beer, try to stop thinking about it. We order our fooOMG I CAN'T FORGET ABOUT HOW I DRANK MOLD I'M TRYING TO MOVE ON BUT HOLY SHIT IT'S SO DISGUSTING d and wait patiently. Food comes out pretty quickly. It's okay. Mom complained about her cold sauerkraut, my quesadilla was soggy like it was microwaved and not grilled, dad's fish and MOLD JUST FLOATING ON THE TOP OF MY DRINK LIKE DOES NOBODY ORDER THAT BEER OR THEY DON'T CLEAN THEIR TAPS OR WHAT I MEAN COME ON chips tasted like the fry oil was old.   Overall, not great. Wouldn't go back. They did have some killer artwork of a naked lady with a moose staring at her booty which almost made up for all of it."}
{"text":"Fries are so good and the drink menu is big. Lots of choices. Amazing bartenders that went above and beyond for us. Would definitely come back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I actually really liked this place.  It was spacey, and there was a lot of seating. A lot of people which meant a lot of noise, but we were seated in a quieter corner which was nice. The food was plated nicely and it all tasted good.   I had the dirty bird I think, and it was okay.  Only downside is the waitresses took a while to get back to us, and the food took a while as well."}
{"text":"Had Sahara as a server and she was the best server I've ever had downtown. Super quick, friendly and some how memorized our orders without writing them down (as a previous server this impresses me, there were a lot of us here). I've always loved this place and really impressed by her. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I don't think I would be back to The Loose Moose for their Live entertainment, their food, their ambiance. But I know I will definitely be back for some beers.  The draft beer list is impressive.  Unibroue  Oast House (My new favourite brewery no in LCBO yet) Silversmith Great Lakes  Muskoka Lakes of Bays Cheshire Valley Junction Kensington  Cameron's Mill Street Hop City Steam Whistle  Sampling sizes are available from $1.15 if you not sure what you want to drink. And if your friend still cannot find something they want to drink, there's always Coors Light and Canadian (no judgement here!) or try one of the beer cocktails?  I doubt I want to come back on a Saturday night. This place does have a \"meat\" market vibe and I prefer a biermarkt vibe.  Food is a lot better than what I would expect. The Kentucky Dry Rub Wings were juicy and tasty. The garlic fries a little soggy but great drunk food.  For a group, automatic gratuity of 18% is applied. But most of the people in our group has a little too much to drink and tip on top the tip and kept thinking why their drinks and food were so expensive.. but more is better than less?  The space is huge and they takes reservations, so always a good back up if you have a big group on weekend.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love the new beer selection they added to their menu. Food was okay... nothing more. I was there for the leafs play off game and I had a lot of fun cheering our boys on. The atmosphere and crowed enhanced my enjoyment for the game. I will return to this place but I would like to see a better food program."}
{"text":"ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  i was visiting toronto for the first time, from out of the country, and someone recommended loose moose.  seemed like a cool enough of a spot.  went in, the main floor was full, so we had to go downstairs.  i don't remember what the main floor was like, so this review is just for the downstairs.  i was really disappointed.  i felt like i was in a creepy basement of an old bowling alley.  it was dark, depressing, i might as well have been in some middle-of-nowhere bar in montana in the wintertime.  on top of that, the food was not yummy.  i only ordered the chicken caesar salad because i wasn't in the mood for anything greasy or typical bar fare, but i could tell the salad didn't have very fresh ingredients.   my friend ordered the buffalo chicken tostada, and that wasn't very good either.    in general, i guess if you're looking for a dive bar type of feel and that kind of food, this might be your spot.  if you want a fun atmosphere and quality food, don't go here."}
{"text":"Came here after a Raptors game with a bunch of friends. Jack Astors was full, and we just wanted a couple of drinks. We came to The Loose Moose, got seated and then found out they don't have pitchers! Extremely disappointing, but the server did try to unsuccessfully sell us on the idea of buying a beer mug and getting cheaper refills the next time we bring it in. Which means we would have to lug around a glass mug if we feel like going there. Only a few things on the food menu. We just got the fries, which were okay, and frankly the only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1. Server was absent most of the night, not the best service. Wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"Came here for a beer and to watch the Cup finals back in June.... the beer list is long, but not THAT long. Ended up getting just a Steam whistle.  TV view is great from the bar-- it's one of those huge multi screen views.  Food smelled great, but didn't order as we had just had dinner.   Great place to grab a beer and watch a game."}
{"text":"This is a great place to chill after a game is finished at the ACC or the Rogers Center because it's a big venue, lots of big screens and they close late.   I had the sweet chili chicken bowl. It was alright entree but I wouldn't say it would be an entree I would particularly recommend. There was a great mix of greens and 5-6 friend chicken breast bites in the bowl. My friend ordered a pound of wings with a side of fries. Did I mention that their sauce is all made in house? So you should see for yourself if it satisfies your taste buds! The wings were a decent size and they gave about 10 wings for the pound which wasn't bad!   LAST TIP?!  If you're around the area for lunch, stop by for their lunch special because it's only $12 Monday to Friday from 11 am to 2 pm and beer on their swing taps is for $5 Monday to Friday before 5 pm."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were good but the service was absolutely horrible. Will never be going back. We had a big party booked with them beforehand, and they made getting in a nightmare, even though we had booked it. After we ordered, the waiter brought 2 quesadillas, but had no idea which was which. Eventually he gave one to a vegetarian friend of mine, and another to a girl down the table. We realized that my friend received a chicken quesadilla, while another girl at the end of the table received hers. When we told the waiter, he made a huge fuss and said that because the other girl had already started eating, she would need to pay for both the chicken one that she ordered, plus the one she had bitten into. He made a fuss about bringing my friend a new one. They made well over $500 from our large group, but were extremely uncourteous and I will definitely not be coming back."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Some of it was hot and some of it was cold. We send the cold fries back eventually, and they brought back hot ones.    The service was friendly enough BUT ridiculously slow.   Atmosphere was very loud so it was hard to have a conversation.   I'd rank this just ok, not really impressed enough to go back."}
{"text":"I ate here several times during a recent conference.  Great food and good beer selection (for Canada, I guess).  Friendly staff and cool atmosphere.  It can get extremely crowded so be prepared.  The fried chicken is ridiculously huge and equally delicious.  Will definitely visit again the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a work function.  Good selection of drinks and its a cool place.  The food is typical tavern food.  I had some wings - yummy flavours such as bbq, honey garlic and dusted dill, nachos and cheese, sliders and this very different fries concoction - sweet potato, potatoes, onions and cheese, yum!  This place consists of an upper and lower floor, there was cool music and a great setup for lounging with friends.  I was there on a saturday at 5pm and it was busy."}
{"text":"So we were down town Toronto looking for a unique restaurant and we came across the \"Loose Moose\"  The name itself pulled me in but the decor inside was quite unique. I loved the tables as everyone seemed to be very unique, some had Fire Hydrants as the legs, othe radiators, wall decor was very interesting esp. The phones. Food was just OK!!! Good selection of beer but I am not a beer guy. Wine selection was very poor.  I had the fish and chips but it was nothing special. 2 Stars for that. Fish was OK, Fries poor and so was the salad. My buddies burger looked good.  Would I go back probably no but would love to go back and photograph more!!!"}
{"text":"Litttttttt fammmmm, tacos were Lit, grilled cheese was lit as well and the server provided excellence in service. First stop for dinner in Canada, and couldn't be happier."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend, or at least the Antler Room, to most people. Food is priced fairly well for downtown Toronto but was decent quality at best - my ribs were overcooked but still good. But the two stars are really a result of the environment. The lighting was so poor down there, almost everyone except for myself had their phone flashlight out just to read the menu. Then there's the seating which was about as comfortable as sitting on a boulder - most of us were swapping out the chairs as soon as we go there with ones that were a tiny bit more comfortable. All in all, the only thing saving this place from getting one star was the service. Lisa was our server and she was very nice and pleasant to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great place! I had the \"Honey, who shrunk my woody\" with a couple... maybe a few pints. The staff was great and their service too. The sliders were surprisingly good, I'm usually disappointed because most places are dry. These were delicious. I was with 2 other people and they had nachos and the other had fish tacos. Both loved what they ordered.   Inside I was quiet, but we showed up close to closing. Really big and perfect for groups.   Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pretty much summed up below.  Was here for the Autoshow and have been here intoxicated here before sporting events numerous times.  Busy restaurant/pub style place that is close to ACC/Union etc and gets very busy when there are games.  Upstairs fills up first and then you can go downstairs to sit if necessary.  Service was pretty decent considering how busy it was.  Lots of beer/draft to choose from which is cool.  I had wings loaded fries and a draft the size of two babies heads.  May have to try a burger there, as the look really good.  Until next time, maybe when the Leafs actually start winning."}
{"text":"Live and upbeat place! Prices was a little off and over priced in my opinion....but great atmosphere didn't stay long after having a beer or 3 :)"}
{"text":"When I visit my friend Kevin in Toronto I always want to go here. They have an AMAZING beer selection. and I'm not even sure how many they truly have. But if I can find Anchor Steam in Canada, I'm happy! I've gotten the Garlic Fries, and they are amazing!! I've had salads and some chicken tacos. Awesome. All of it.   This place is large, and always busy so if you plan on going before a Jays game, make sure to reserve a spot. Last time I was here, I went to the Red Sox vs Jay and it was a 1230pm game... this place was busy... I found a seat at the bar. But all the tables were taken. I barely made it out of there in time."}
{"text":"Despite the dude-bro factor I have to say I really enjoy the Loose Moose.   They have a great selection of beers on tap, the atmosphere is pretty decent and it's a great place to people watch.  While I wouldn't hit up the Loose Moose for a quiet one on one environment, the service isn't bad, the food is decent and the location isn't bad."}
{"text":"I wasn't looking for it but I may have found the Cliché Capital of Canada. Multiple televisions hanging over the bar showing only sporting events? Check. Drinks served in thimble-sized glasses so that the bar doesn't blow the mixer budget? Check. Mediocre food served unimaginatively? Check. Young female bartender fawning over the young male patrons on their phones and ignoring the slightly older single woman? Ccccchhheeeccckkk! You want a tip, here's a tip: who do you think has more disposable income? At one point I almost stood up, leaned over the bar and begged one of the THREE bartenders to take my order. Must be true that women get more invisible as they age. Based on my treatment here I'll be a nothing more than a Who on a speck yelling \"I AM HERE\" at Horton in thirty years. It wasn't a game night. Other people were being attended to without difficulty. I never mind eating by myself in a resto but the way that they had no time for me (but all the time for others) made me feel... sad.   Seating options include the bar or high-tops. You can decide where you want to remain unacknowledged if you don't fall into the favoured demographic.  Not that any of the servers asked me but the food wasn't great."}
{"text":"Listed in the categories \"traditional\" and \"sports bar\", eh? Loose Moose is both of those things, but also desidedly NOT those things. The food is anything but traditional and I didn't notice a single television during my meal, though there were plenty. That's the beauty of the way it's designed: if you're there for a game they've got you covered, but if you're not the TVs wont distract you and your party.   There are plenty of cozy nooks, including one made out of an old bank vault. Long Biergarten style tables for friendly hang outs, and equally long tables with chairs for an after work team get-togethers. The decor is accented with found vintage items from the personal collection of the owner.   As for the food! I had the Sweet Potato Thing ($7.95) to start and it should have been the only thing we ordered. When your server tells you it's big...believe them. You could get away with calling this thing a meal and still take some home in a doggy-bag. Cocnut chili dip was fantastic too.  But it was a Friday night and we weren't done yet. We went on to have the Tun sliders, and pork belly tacos. All beautifully presented and extremely tasty. We finished off with some maple bacon mini donuts (which we really did have to take home in a doggy-bag).   I haven't even mentioned the craft beer selection yet! It's a long list, maybe not intensive enough to take on other Front St. beer bars, like C'est What, but it's decent. And the selling point is you can get sample sizes for an average of $1.29 each. If you're like me and forget that you hate hops you're not stuck with an entire pint of an IPA, and you can quickly move on to that Weissbier you meant to order.   More than worth a try. I am going back for those donuts!"}
{"text":"A great selection of beer on draught.  Food is average, nothing special, but will fill a hole when needed."}
{"text":"Loud, somewhat middling fare - but the atmosphere is better than the nearby Jack Astor's. Consistently busy and somewhat slow service, but close to pretty much everything."}
{"text":"I really like the feel & decor at the loose moose! Great craft beer menu too. I didn't have a great server the last time I went, but it could've just been her."}
{"text":"Been coming here to the Loose Moose for years because it never disappointing. Fantastic beer selection and the food is always top notch!  My last visit was for a special occasion - a joint birthday party with over 20 guests. They were able to give us our own little section of the downstairs bar, provided we spent over $450 (not a problem for my crowd of drinkers!), and they even let us bring our own cake(s) free of charge! The live band played great covers and we had a ball dancing like idiots until closing time. :)"}
{"text":"Only giving it a second star because the food I got to go wasn't half bad. However, it is extremely overpriced (my Woodford old fashioned was $18) and the service was terrible. Bartender got me a drink/took my order then ignored me the entire time I was there.... I reallyyyyy wanted a water but didn't want to interrupt her convo w/ the other bartender. Seems like a good place to go have beers on a Friday Saturday night - would not be back if I were in Toronto - in fact I would probably avoid it"}
{"text":"This place was great!!  It's a massive place with an upstairs and downstairs. We were on our way to the football game and wanted something non-franchise.... so stepped into the Loose Moose and had a couple pints of \"Double Trouble\" beer.  It was delicious, and the taps were the in the shape of devil tales... pretty cool.  It was a very lively place with a funky bar that sort of resembles a tetris game (but the parts don't move).   We liked this place so much that we came back after the game with two out of town Calgary fans.  Second time we settled downstairs were there was a live band playing.  My girlfriend did some dancing and was promptly hit on numerous times.  All was good... nothing too bad and everyone was polite.  ;)    Overall, place was great... the Calgary fans loved it (and even paid the group bill).  We would definitely come back when in the mood for a good beer.   Oh... they have a MASSIVE beer menu... and although we didn't eat any food here, I took a look at many of the items others were eating and I must say, everything looked extremely appetizing."}
{"text":"Pretty good wings and other bar food, good beer selection, TVs everywhere, friendly and prompt service, good location.    In sum, a very good place to watch a game if that's what you're looking for, but not the kind of place I'd be hanging out in otherwise."}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience at the loose moose.  On the rare occasion I finish work early I use it as a place to meet my fiancé after she finishes work for beers. We're drawn here by the long beer list and the fact they play rock music. We have eaten here twice and not been disappointed with our meal and the service has been fine. Maybe a bit over priced, it has the feel and quality of a pub but the prices of an upmarket restaurant.  The lower floor is almost like a beer hall and they host live bands there. this is always a good night and I enjoy it regularly.  I'm not a sports fan but I have been there when they have had games on their huge TV's and I think it's would make a great spot for sports fans."}
{"text":"Good place great service had my first fish and chips there with malt vinegar cool drinks  good menu as well. Wish they had summers bee but over all good."}
