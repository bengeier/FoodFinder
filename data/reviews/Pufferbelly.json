{"text":"Stopped by for a late lunch while in town for the King James Classic Basketball Tournament 2011.  Nice area of a college town.  It was a little warm in the restaurant.  Service was just ok. Ordered a bottle of KJ Chard and it was not chilled.  Food was very good and I would go back next time I was in town.  Price was good."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect in a small town in Ohio, so since I don't eat most kinds of meat, I was just thankful I found something I could eat at the Pufferbelly. But I have to say I was shocked that the pierogies I ordered were - I swear! - the frozen Mrs T's ones I buy at the store sometimes. I just can't imagine a restaurant serving pre-made frozen food. They did have a nice helping of sauteed onions and peppers with them, but still. From what I could see of the other people's dinners I was with, their fare runs to the very basic. Order a burger here, if you eat that kind of thing, and it would probably be fine. I will say that the desserts were not too bad. We had the bread pudding, which was nothing great, but  at least it didn't seem mass-produced. Aside from the food, the service was friendly but unprofessional. The atmosphere was cute, because it's in the old train station, but not at all stylish. At least it wasn't very expensive - and someone else was paying!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for many years. Love the atmosphere. It is a little difficult to find parking in the area during lunch but well worth the trouble. All of the food is good. I would recommend Pufferbelly every time."}
{"text":"A converted railroad depot makes an interesting setting for a good family style meal. A great staff that is more than willing to go out of their way to help. Good food and a wide variety. Clever menu names to boot."}
{"text":"Over the years, I have been to the Pufferbelly many times either with family or with groups. Their food is inconsistent, but usually good; some times much better than others.  After my last experience, I will not return and I have encouraged others to not go there. On my last visit I was using an I-Shop coupon that I had purchased for the Pufferbelly. I asked before I used it if there were any restrictions. The waitress said there shouldn't be any restrictions but to be sure she checked with the hostess. I was told everything was ok. Also, it was suggested that we order a dessert to use the full amount of the coupon!  When it was time to pay, I gave them the coupon and the rest of the payment. The assistant manager, Holly, came to our table and said they no longer accept the I-Shop coupons.  Sorry for the misinformation, but we owed the entire amount of the bill.  We paid.  I had never had a problem with I-Shop coupons.  When we left, I called I-Shop, the owner of the coupon company called me personally and said that should have never happened.   It has been several months and I am out my money. I needed to plan a banquet in the Kent area for one of my groups and it will not be at the Pufferbelly."}
{"text":"This is one of the fancier places is Kent.  If I had a date at Kent State and wanted to splurge it would be here.  Food is okay and really not to pricey.  Next to the railroad tracks and the river but it is hard to get a good view.  The location is sweet because the restaurant is located in an old rail station."}
{"text":"I was forced by the app to give it a star. Just left there.  Horrendous experience.  We had reservations for 6.00 and so did several other people - we were all told there were no other tables!  Then people who walked in after us were seated as tables were being cleared.   The hostess wasn't asking for names nor checking her book!  Then we were seated finally after the cleaned off table was given to a walk-in!   Once we decided on a wine,  we were told it was not available,  picked another one and then told the original one was available!   Our food was served cold and the brushetta was 4 pieces of cold bread,  with a cold shrimp on top with cut up cold tomato and a little shredded cheese, cold,  was in the middle.  Awful.   My husband's ribs and fries were cold.   The hostess and waiter were very apologetic. However,  never again."}
{"text":"I've been to Pufferbelly quite a few times and haven't had terribly slow service or horrible food like some of the other reviewers. I've ordered the Melonie's Turkey Wrap for lunch on several occasions, and it's been delicious every time. The one thing I wasn't crazy about at this restaurant was the brunch buffet. I took my grandparents here twice, and they were definitely not impressed with the cold eggs and lackluster pastries available for brunch. I wasn't as horrified by the food, but it honestly wasn't the greatest. I'd suggest coming here for a late lunch. As many have mentioned, it is a restaurant that attracts an older crowd, so don't expect to come here for a swanky night on the town or a gourmet meal. It's a nice, quiet and quaint place to grab a bite to eat with its own historic atmosphere. It's a good place to go if you want to try something in Kent that has a different vibe from the other college student-friendly dining options in the area."}
{"text":"I just got home from a wonderful lunch at the PufferBelly.  I really appreciated the free parking in their lot. The decor inside and out is lovely. We were welcomed by a friendly owner or manger as we arrived. I've eaten here for over 25 years so I didn't have to look long at their varied menu. Although I often order the French onion soup and cashew chicken salad on a croissant, today I ordered the chicken Marsala with a side of broccoli. This was a very fresh tasting entree without the sometimes heavy and overbearing sauce that I've had at other restaurants. The lightly breaded pan fried chicken breasts were moist and very tender, the capellini was cooked just right, fresh mushrooms were used in a light sauce, and sliced scallions topped the dish. Normally I would plan to take half home for another meal but I just couldn't put my fork down! The broccoli was not overcooked and only needed a bit of salt. I'm always made to feel comfortable, able to easily carry on a conversation, and I can't wait to return. Kent, OH at its finest!"}
{"text":"Nice quite place for a casual lunch.  Not pricey.  Pretty quite.  The service was good.  Good for the family."}
{"text":"The Pufferbelly, the nicest restaurant in town. The only time you will see the inside of this place is when your parents visit and take you out to eat."}
{"text":"On Sunday 11:00-2:30 Branch $14
I like food here but I think it is expensive...
Good traditional atmosphere."}
{"text":"My first visit to this train depot was in 1952.  It was the way I traveled to see my Grandparents in Pittsburgh.  

I have eaten at the Pufferbelly 3-4 times this year.  I do not recall having any significant complaints during any visit.  Most recently, my visit was definitely above average.  I was alone and seated at a small table on the trackside of the restaurant.  I arrived at 11:45 am on a weekday.

My server came to my table quickly, was very friendly and explained some of the more popular items on the menu.  I thoroughly enjoyed my food and desert.  What I liked most was the professional manner of my server.  I eat out frequently and regardless of the food quality, the performance of the server can make or break a restaurant meal.

I believe like many restaurant patrons, that when I decide to eat out, my available choices are mostly chain type establishments.  The Pufferbelly is a refreshing change both in decor and it's history.  Additionally, I like the privacy that the booths provide if you don't want to share your conversation with the next table.

My suggestion for those with very discriminating tastes, would be to discuss the menu with your server and not just take for granted the menu offerings.  I find that it is often worth the time to show interest in the server's opinion."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, an old train station.
French onion soup, quesadillas, salads, Reuben, hamburgers are our favorites . 
The special of the day is usually very good. We have been there many times and are never disappointed. The service has been great."}
{"text":"I got the portobello stack. It was very good. The service was a little slow, but we had a large party. 
I definitely would go back. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Pufferbelly is a good Traditional American Restaurant, not great, but worth a visit. We had the specials (salmon and prime rib).  All were good. Service was excellent and staff was very attentive. For dessert we had the peanut butter pie (good) and the chocolate snowball (great). I would definitely go back for another chocolate snowball...Dark rum, coffee, chocolate, topped with whipped cream...yummy!"}
{"text":"This place just kinda epitomizes the parts about Kent I don't really like. Focus on the past without any regard to the important bits of what the place is, and it keeps on trying to be something that doesn't really fit all that well. Much like the Kent Stage, actually.

Yes, the building is cool, but I'm not eating the building. I like a good eating establishment but this just kinda feels like a family owned TGI Fridays, or like the prototypical Fridays.

The food has always been mediocre and a little overpriced. Not really much to say.

I think they would do much better if they did more of a Yours Truly kind of thing instead of what they're doing now. Otherwise it just seems like an old person restaurant to me with little to no appeal to people who aren't already regulars."}
{"text":"Amazing interior and great atmosphere. I got the Vegetable Pasta because it had artichoke hearts and sun dried tomatoes (my favorite). The only thing really missing was a good sauce to tie it all together. The waitress was very sweet and attentive even though you could tell she was busy. And the ice cream cake was amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Pufferbelly several times now and am always blown away. It's the nicest sit down restaurant in Kent. It's a little pricey for the college students that populate the town, so like my fellow Yelpers, I will point out that most students only go here with their parents. The crowd is generally older.

On average, it's fairly quiet. However, on one occasion they seated us at a table for two next to a large, very loud group; the staff was more than happy to move us to a quieter booth when we asked.

I've had several different dishes here, but the Bourbon Salmon is hands down the best. They use the perfect amount of Bourbon sauce and the salmon is always cooked thoroughly. I'm not even a broccoli fan, but when paired with the Bourbon Salmon, I never even ask to substitute it! They somehow make it taste good.

The service is fairly fast, but if you're going there for dinner (regardless of the night); make reservations. They're usually able to accommodate you but it's much easier if you call ahead."}
{"text":"I hosted a surprise party at the Pufferbelly.. The food was delicious and the service was wonderful! Thank you so much! Thank you for making our day so special!!"}
{"text":"Only have been for brunch but it's hit or miss. Good selection, the service was great both times we went. I also think it's priced fairly for brunch. $30 for two brunch buffets. 

The building itself is cool and makes the visit :)"}
{"text":"We never really ate at this place but did have our wedding reception here. The history and setup of the building are great. Plus, Kevin (the owner) is extremely accommodating. He made everything very easy, especially since we were planning it from Florida!  They even made specialty milkshakes for all the kids. Nice touch. Anyway, great setup, prices, food. We were very happy and so were our 100+ guests."}
{"text":"Overrated. Decent tasting food, overpriced, decent service, \"meh\" decor/atmosphere, good quantity of food. It's a nice place to take someone for an upscale meal in a not-so-upscale area of Ohio."}
{"text":"Wife and I are both retired and eat out a lot -- frequently easier and cheaper than shopping and cooking for two.  Pufferbelly used to be one of our favorite restaurants in Kent, a city not known for haute cuisine.  But new ownership has led to price increases (not surprises given the cost increases for groceries) and other changes in the menu. The most notable is that salads, once included in the price of entrees, are now add-ons.  Quality is OK, better for lunch than dinner.  Popular with Kent State faculty and administrators and parents of students.  Parking can be difficult, particularly at night since the restaurant is on a street of bars, quite popular with Kent State students seeking to escape their studies."}
{"text":"We had pasta dishes which were delicious and hot.  I had the veggie, it had just the right amount of crunchiness.  French onion soup excellent as always.  The air conditioning wasn't very good though and it was a bit uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Went to the Sunday brunch.  The waffles were delicious, however they were out or syrup.  The omelet could have been really good, but the inside was undercooked and it didn't arrive until after we asked for the check.  The price was ok at around $13 per person, but there are much better options in town for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"We had reservations today, for Mothers' Day. We were a party of eight and were assured when we arrived that our table was being cleared. When it was cleared another party walked in and said that they wanted a table for eight and they were taken to the table prepared for our group. We do not know whether or not they had reservations. They did not say so when they walked in. We proceeded to wait and then were offered two separate tables!!!  No apology was offered or explanation as to why they could not honor our reservation time or table. A half hour after our reservation time had passed we called another restaurant in town which had tables and were only too happy to accommodate us, so we cancelled at The Pufferbelly, and had a wonderful meal at this alternate restaurant, with no waiting time. We had children in our group and they were becoming very impatient. Maybe The Pufferbelly did not want to serve a group with children!
This has been our restaurant of choice for Mother's Day for many years, so we were very disappointed at the 
poor co- ordination and communication between staff and the lack of courtesy to us."}
{"text":"Unbelievably slow service and highly overpriced for the quality.  The food was good, but it wasn't spectacular nor was it freshly prepared.  Lots of pre-packaged items rather than made fresh.  They also forgot one of my sides.  Not likely to return, which is a shame because the location is very ideal, which I imagine is the only reason why they're still in business.  The building itself is historic and quaint so it has potential, but it needs a new staff and a new chef...badly."}
{"text":"Pufferbelly is a neat restaurant. It's in an old train station, brick walls, very pretty. There is a lot of room and the Christmas tree is beautiful. 
The food was a disappointment. We ordered pretzels as an appetizer, they were great. I had an open face beef sandwich with mushrooms, it was pretty good, not anything that I'll go back for, but pretty good. My husband ordered prime rib, It didn't look appetizing, It could've been cooked a little better, and he was very disappointed with the taste. Our server was friendly. Most of our disappointment came from the prime rib."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. Nothing outstanding and food is just average. Portions are normal size. The staff seems friendly enough and there's a lot of seating. 

The ambiance is cool, lots of brick, tall ceilings and Americana decor. Nice place to come once but probably won't be back. If the food was better than we'd be back."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a wonderful brunch at this excellent restraunt. Great experience, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We so wanted to love this place.  Neat building, great location, parking was great but it totally fell short on the food.  We ordered the artichoke dip, Veggie Aglio and a rueben and the only thing that was edible was the rueben.  We should have sent the dip back - some kind of sour cream whipped up with hardly a hint of artichoke but we did not.  Very bad news.  When the main course came, the Veggie Aglio was really bad.  Oily, greasy and just gross -  it did get sent back.  In the end they did not charge for the Veggie Aglio  They charged for the dip, even though it was not eaten and we complained.  They did offer a free dessert for our complaint which was okay.  Kent is up and coming and if they are going to compete they need to totally clean up their act.  Just a bad experience."}
{"text":"I started with the gazpacho, which was a good choice. I am not a real big cold soup person, or tomato's, or heck, not even cucumbers, so I have no idea why I tried this. The waitress was very persuasive about trying it, so I took her suggestion and tried it. Very fresh, and definitely good. 

My main was the chicken fajita salad, and unlike the gazpacho, I am a salad and fajita person. The chicken was sautéed in a fresh teryaki and ginger sauce with onions and peppers. I thought the tomato wedges were unnecessary, especially after my soup, and ate just the meat and lettuce. It was a little too much sauce so ask for them to go light on it, I did and it was still a bit heavy. 

I ended with the chocolate snowball.  A flour-less low carb treat that looks like...yep a snowball (whip cream).  Dark rum, coffee, and chocolate. Yeah, as good as it sounds, and yet another suggestion by my waitress.  Not too rich, and a good way to end the meal."}
{"text":"Krissy M. is right - you'll most likely see this place when your parents come to celebrate a KSU accomplishment. Don't just save it for a special occasion when someone else is footing the bill.
The food is good - some much better than others and they have many different price levels so you can get a good meal here on a college budget. 
They have a bar area with tables, which is a great place to hang out if you're just interested in some appetizers and drinks. There are boats and other things hanging from the ceiling so it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Lovely staff and interesting building. But food is really average. Don't have the ribs. I'm writing this as I deal with stomach ache the morning after as a consequence of ordering it. Stay at the bar and chat with the people who work there. Much better for you."}
{"text":"The absolute worst restaurant I have ever been to. The food is disgusting. You don't even need teeth. This is a great place for senior citizens. It's next to the train tracks, so don't expect to be able to talk to your friends while eating. The place smells and has hideous decor. I appreciate historic places, but this is one that just should not stay open."}
{"text":"This is a nice family restaurant.  Different than other spots in Kent that are geared more toward the college students and faculty."}
{"text":"If I'm being totally honest & a little bitchy, I'm so annoyed by some of the reviews of Pufferbelly posted here. This place is an old standby, a Kent institution, & it's long been one of my favorite places to go, though I don't make it there often.

The building, for starters, is way cool - an old railroad station? Those exposed brick walls & high ceilings? The gazebo & train car outside? Charming to the max. This place has character.

It's good for just about anything - first dates, anniversary dates, dinner with the parents, a big family outing, drinks with friends, Sunday brunch. Full bar, lots of seating, fills up quickly so make a reservation if you're going during a busy time. Overall, can't beat this kind of versatility.

The food is good, though not necessarily outstanding. Still, there's something for everyone, from hearty burgers to a slew of tasty sandwiches to a few pasta dishes, including multiple vegetarian options. Their prices are fairly low, especially compared to other nice-ish restaurants in the area, & it sure beats another night at some generic, mass-produced chain like Applebee's or Ruby Tuesday's."}
{"text":"I love the building because it is not every day that you get to have dinner in an old railroad station. The decor is a little outdated but I forgive them. The food is good but a little overpriced for what it is and you always have to expect to wait a while for your food, or to have someone even come to your table. I get nostalgic every time I see the building though and I still live in Kent. When I was a student I used to take my parents here almost every time they would come to visit me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and worth a visit if you are in the area. The food was good, not outstanding or ground breaking but good American comfort food."}
{"text":"I have been to the bars in Kent and a few of the restaurants many times, and I have walked past this every time in Kent. I always thought it looked cute, but a friend said it was really fancy or something, and not that that is bad, but usually when up in Kent it is me and all of my husband's friends, not like a date night of anything. I ended up just looking up menus on one of the drives up to Stow / Kent and came across this. The menu, while seeming to have quite the random array of food, intrigued me. it was not fancy, though, but just normal American type food with normal prices. 

The restaurant itself is pretty cute, but some of the decor gets a bit out dated and sad because it actually is a pretty place. It was freezing when we went in, so much that no one had their jacket off, and I was sitting there shivering in a dress with no tights. My bad. Still, I was intent on getting warm food.

I ordered the onion crock to start, and it was amazingly good. It was made well, like traditional french onion soup with a beef broth base, and the addition of a burgundy wine really made the flavor great. The cheese was tasty and there was lots of it, and the bread soaked in the juice well. My husband was jealous. I would come here again and ordermlike three bowls it was that good. If I were judging the onion soup alone, five stars.  But, that is not the case.

The bread they serve is also quite good. It is crispy oj the eterior, but also soft and crumbly. It had good flavor and I was pleasantly surprised.

Iordered the pierogies - which either were Mrs T's brand or an exact knockoff of them. I cook those up at home all the time and know and love the taste butnInwas hoping for something better. They were cooked okay - some parts were crispy and froed and some were just not. The peppers and onions had been cooked too fast and were more burnt than soft and delicious. I mostly avoided them. The pierogis were good, but I would not order them again.

My husband ordered the philly cheesesteak wrap. It had wayyyy too much cheese ( which is not bad but it was overpowering ). The meat and cheese taste and quality was quite good though, it was enjoyable, but not truly memorable. The fries were like boardwalk fries, but not crispy - they were almost weirdly soft. The flavor of the fries was good so I did enjoy them.

Our service was okay. The waitress forgot things a lot, and she did notmrealy check back. It took while to get the check, which it was cold, so that was hard.

Overal, I would go back, and I would recommend it. It is a great, non-chain option for the Stow / Kemt area."}
{"text":"What's a little hometown Yelping between friends?
Who knows - some of y'all might meander through Kent, Ohio one of these days... and, won't it be nice to know a few good places to stop along the way?

The Pufferbelly - is where I went on my first date - it is one of the \"fancier\" restaurants in Kent.  At least it was in 1986.

The cool part of this restaurant is that a goodly portion of it is located in an old train car... next to the railroad tracks... next to the river... with a view of the Kent waterfall.

Scenic.

The food here is amazing.  They make this chicken with some sort of walnut/wine glaze and cheese that makes my mouth water... I think the Pufferbelly was the first place I ever had triple creme brie, too.  And, please do not get me started on the French friggin' onion soup... like you died and went straight to foodie heaven -- HOME MADE.

If you ever have cause to be in Kent, Ohio - stop on by the Pufferbelly - totally worth the trip."}
{"text":"Looking for good food? Keep looking. 
Looking for a cool building? Stop and look, then move on. 

Pros:
-Fast ,Friendly Service
-Neat building (they could have done a lot more with the interior decor, needs more authentic \"old train station feel\")
-Great Lakes Christmas Ale on tap - Very tasty
-Rice Pilaf was tasty and steamed broccoli was prepared well.

Cons (in order of occurance)
-Bread arrived quickly, oooh turned quickly to ewww, dry and bland
-The lettuce in my caesar salad was performing the backstroke in the excessive pool of dressing they mixed in (dressing mediocre, not homemade, croutons good, likely homemade). Uneaten plate sat on my table until the end of my dinner.
-Salmon had good flavor, the parts that weren't burnt to a crisp anyway
-Apple pie with ice cream recommended by waitress: Apple pie was small but tasty, however, the scoop of ice cream was literally the size of a large marble, I kid you not! Why so stingy with the ice cream if customers are paying almost 5 bucks for this???? I had to take a picture.
-The food is way overpriced for the low quality it was.

Other facts:
Average customer age: 50
Wait staff somewhat inexperienced although friendly

Bottom line: I eat in a lot of restaurants as a business traveller, and this was simply diappointing. They need a chef Gordon Ramsay makeover to the menu and decor. This place needs tasty food and a more authentic \"train depot\" feel to get a better rating from me."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Pufferbelly many times. The building itself is pretty neat an old converted train station. The decor is eh, but still it is original enough to be exciting. 

They have a wide variety of items on the menu. I really like the Bourbon Glazed porterhouse pork chop. It is amazing, and giant I might add. I have had many sandwiches and burgers there as well. Everything is usually pretty decent. Some things a bit on the bland side for me, but I tend to like spicy and heavy flavors so americana is sometimes too bland for me.

Service is always decent, maybe a bit inexperienced, but I have always been well taken care of. The average age of the guests is a bit older which sometimes adds to the dated feel. 

It is a standbye of mine for a decent place, not great but decent. It is also one of the few places for a better place in Kent."}
{"text":"Definitely not impressed. We went here for dinner. We started with the special blueberry white chocolate dip (good, but nothing special. I could probably make something similar at home), and the stuffed pretzels (once again, fine, but nothing special. Too many caraway seeds). The cocktails were acceptable. However, the entrees. Oy. My mom got the Greek chicken pasta salad. It literally had no dressing on it- plain noodles, chicken, and feta. My stepfather got the eggs Benedict, which he liked. However it was served with French fries, which was odd. My boyfriend got the house sirloin, and I got the Jamaican shrimp and steak. First off, up until today I did not know shrimp could be dry and tough. Guess what, it can be. Second, both steaks had no flavor. I never use A1 and I had to, just to get through it. Finally, both our steaks were way over cooked and fatty. We asked for medium rare, and rare. At best, they were cooked medium well. We mentioned it to the waiter, but opted not to send them back simply because we didn't want to wait for new steak. The waiter said he would mention it to the manager and see what could be done, but nothing else was said or done to us. The manager even stopped by, but didn't utter a word about the problem. Not sure where the disconnect was, but we would have at least liked an apology. Regardless, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, good food and attentive service. We had the chilli for starters. It was good. Served with cheese & tortillas. Then we shared pasta veggie aglio which was very tasty. Dessert was margarita strawberry pie. No criticisms or faults. Prices are very reasonable for the quality & quantity of the food."}
{"text":"My experience here was...okay, I've had better but would be willing to give this place another try.  I ordered their pulled BBQ chicken sandwich- there was next to no sauce, the chicken was not pulled but in larger chunks, the cinnamon/butter sauce that came with the sweet potato fries was disgusting! And in the center of my sandwich had  large chunks of fat- super gross!
   But what I managed to pick through was average at the best. I was annoyed that their menu clearly states something about choosing from a variety of herbal teas yet I wasn't given the option to choose. Instead I was given the cheap brewing tea Lipton makes that has no flavor :( My sister in law got their pierogies but was disappointed because there was very little cheese in them. Yet the bread was good and I liked our server & who I'm pretty sure was the manager (very nice guy)!"}
{"text":"Be on and eggs are delicious.   There are many deserts as well. Don't pass by the special bread butters and the waffles."}
{"text":"Pricey but good.  I haven't been here in 10 years, so that should tell ya something."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for spending time with good friends!  My fav:  the BBQ chicken flatbread pizza!!!  It is THE BEST.  The old train station is wonderful, and Kevin and the staff really make you feel welcome.  There are a lot of great places to eat in this town, but this place is special."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a zero, I would.  My husband and daughter tried to go there for lunch on a Saturday (Daddy and daughter quality time) and were told that they \"would probably be very busy all day' and basically that they couldn't wait for a table to open up, even though there were open tables available.  I don't know if you have to have a reservation, even for lunch, or if they just don't like kids eating there, or what the problem is - but if that's the case, why have a kid's menu?  It's not like my husband or daughter were dressed like slobs either.  I've eaten there before with my parents, and it's not like the food or service is good enough to be turning away customers.  Needless to say, we will never try to eat there again and we will be sharing our experience with everyone we know."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years -- like, maybe 25+?  I think I have had a good sample of the experience here.  So, this is not a \"one shot case study.\"

What one can usually expect:  Good service and good food.  Nothing extraordinary, but some of it is really quite excellent.  It's not a \"chain\" and the owner is more often than not present when the business is open -- that's a good thing.  And, the Pufferbelly is a most welcome respite from the seriously overpriced fare in the very commercial and glitsy \"new downtown Kent.\"

OK, so why did I not rate this place higher?  Inconsistency.  Example:  There were two of us for lunch today.  We both had the grouper reuben sandwich -- normally quite good.  Once in a while in the past they have been \"fishy\" tasting but generally they are quite excellent.  Today's reuben was almost inedible. Actually, both of use ate about 1/2 of ours, snarfed up the fries (excellent!) and left the rest.  I asked the waitress to make certain the owner was aware that they had problems with the grouper.  I paid the bill -- and resolved never to order that again.  (Too bad -- when it's good it is REALLY good!  But, well, bad fish ... you know ...)

So, overall the place is good.  Decent food and OK spirits -- all at a very fair price."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a meal that as soon as you bite it you know your coming to eat it again. Well that was this meal. I had the lee's turkey wrap because I'm trying to go healthy it was absolutely fantastic. I will 1000% be back. I also had the sweet potato fries because I couldn't resist and it was served with amazing cinnamon butter. All around top notch.  Can't wait to eat again. Must go. Oh yea very clean. Great service. Ambiance is amazing if you don't know the area.  Go go go."}
{"text":"A favorite place I visit often! Food is always good quality and freshly made. Portion sizes are very generous. Menu items are diverse and the desserts are scrumptious. The coffee is always fresh and of great quality. Service is excellent and friendly. Atmosphere is historical and interesting. Large windows with a nice view of the trains. Restrooms are always very clean."}
{"text":"Had the all you can eat brunch buffet on Sunday (11 to 2:30 every Sunday). In historical Kent, this restaurant had a very welcoming and homely ambiance. Very old-timey, and the flags really brought out the patriotic feels, particularly because it was the day after independence day. The servers were really welcoming, and a free drink comes with the buffet too (I had the pineapple juice).

Even though the place was a really nice and welcoming experience, and the servers were super accommodating, the food was mediocre (probably because I only had the buffet style food). The sausage was a little cold, the sauce on the brisket was a bit too salty. The fruit and the pineaplle juice did not seem too fresh. I really enjoyed the eggs benedict though.

I also ordered an omelette. Apparently there was a malfunction with the pans, and it took a long time to get the omelette. The delivery was not great (picture attached). Although the omelette was really yummy, by the time I got I was already full.

I'm giving then the benefit of the doubt and assuming that the omelette malfunction thing was just a one time thing.  Overall, the experience was really pleasant, but the food could use a bit more work."}
