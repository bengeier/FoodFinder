{"text":"Everything we ordered was excellent. Standouts include pancakes with cottage cheese and sour cherries, sausage and Reuben patty melt."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, every single time. No matter what I order. Wow. Wish I could say the same for the front of house staff...between the bizarre soft drink 'policy' (you MUST have ice and only get a portion of the can, for an outrageous $2.50!) to the lack of basic service etiquette (don't start grabbing at customers plates while they still have food in their mouth, especially when you've asked if you can remove the plate and the customer a politely told you 'no'!)... And the tiny, cramped fixed barstools I always get stuck with (as a single patron) are starting to get tiresome too. I really hope they can improve the quality of their service and quit being so cheap with the soft drinks...because I really want to keep coming back again and again. Or maybe takeout could be an option (if it isn't already)."}
{"text":"Amazing diner. Everytime i go I've never bene dissapointed. Amazing food, kind service. Really nothing else to say."}
{"text":"Spectacular. This place is authentic and unapologetic with good ol' comfort food. They do incredible diner classics and it seems like everything is homemade in house. Perhaps my favorite brunch spot in the city. Great crew of friendly folks that seem more like a family. As far as taste goes, you'll be hard pressed to find a better spot on the east side. Highly recommend  White Lilly."}
{"text":"This new place in the neighbourhood is such a breath of fresh air. The menu is fantastic. Ambience is cool but not pretentious like other new diners. The Pastrami sandwich rivals Montreal and New York. Welcome to the hood!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now for both brunch and dinner. The food is fantastic! The service is excellent. You can tell they use quality ingredients.  Try the pastries their excellent."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood!  It is a cute little diner. Love the fluffy pancakes and the breakfast options. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The green goddess broccoli salad and the tomatoes on toast were magically delicious.  Like both are better than anything else I have had in Riverside since the early County Cocktail days.  So good.  My wife won't stop talking about the patty melt.  This place is a ten minute walk from our house. They're going to get sick of seeing us there all the time.   My only complaint are the tiny Beau's branded beer glasses. Proper pints please.  It's not a lot to ask."}
{"text":"Simply amazing. Best breakfast I've had in a while. Menu is curated to appeal to those that appreciate quality and creativity."}
{"text":"Yes I consider myself a donut connoisseur so please do not take it lightly when I say the donuts at this place are INCREDIBLE"}
{"text":"beautiful restaurant friendly staff delicious food  all day breakfast perfect portions  I love it  plan to be a regular customer  food is sooooo wonderful"}
{"text":"45 minute wait for Saturday brunch, so get a coffee nearby while you wait! White Lily is very cozy, and we had a true diner experience. The seating is limited and doesn't accommodate for groups of more than 4. Food was beautiful and delicious, and came reasonably quickly. I got the White Lily Standard thought the bacon was a bit over cooked so next time I'll try the sausage."}
{"text":"Pretty great. My friend and I came here at 10:10am on a Sunday and all the tables were already spoken for- so maybe this is one of those places you need to queue up before 10am lol. We both ordered the traditional breakfast + sausage on the side and the sausage probably pushed us both overboard. The hash would benefit from more seasoning and sitting in the pan a little longer- it tasted just like a bed of shredded potatoes. Sasuage and bacon were delicious. GET THE DAMN DOUGHNUTS oh my god. Just do it."}
{"text":"Grits are not my favourite thing, but I still liked the Southern Breakfast.  Substituted the gravy for the creamy sausage gravy (additional $1.50), with no regrets.  The soft, moist, black pepper-specked biscuit was perfect for soaking up the gravy, though it was so delicious that I could've just devoured the biscuit on its own.    Was impressed by the eggs, for which I asked for over easy.  They arrived absolutely perfect: solid white on the outside and a golden liquid yolk with no visible drippy egg whites.  The eggs in my partner's Patty Melt was equally well done, and the sandwich came skewered with a toothpick on the opposite side of the eggs, so as not to pierce the precious egg yolks.    Would recommend ordering the doughnuts early on, if you plan to get one, because they seem to sell out quickly.  The kitchen had just finished a fresh batch, and I managed the snag one of the last boston creams, which had an ample amount of delicious, still-warm custard inside a chocolate-slicked doughnut tempered with the slightest dust of salt.    Awww yiss."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to White Lily for a bite to eat with our in laws. It was a Saturday evening, so the place wasn't to busy but it had this cute ambience about it when we first stepped in (minus the curtain when you first walk in) I still don't understand why they need that. Anyways on to the food, the food was really good. Everyone enjoyed their meal but the pricing for the quantity of food you get is a little much. It was overall a great dining experience but the pricing just threw us off."}
{"text":"Good food, nice waitress and comfortable atmosphere. Had a very enjoyable brunch w my female counterpart."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly prepared to pig out when I decided to go for brunch at the White Lily Diner.    From all the pictures of super savory offerings that other yelpers have posted, you'd think that you would get a really greasy spoon, comfort food, diner style brunch however this seems not to be the case-necessarily.   White Lily Diner is a relatively simple Diner located in Leslieville on Queen St. just west of Broadview Ave.  The menu is short, prices -reasonable and seating, limited.  We came on Sunday around 12:30pm and ended up waiting about 45 minutes until we were seated.  We ordered the Southern and the Breakfast Patty Melt.    The southern breakfast ($12) came with two eggs (prepared to your liking) 2 bacon strips on a bed of grits and topped with a biscuit and some gravy.  Surprisingly, this dish is not really that heavy.  It was my first time trying grits and I have to say it kind of reminded me of congee, though the grits were much thicker, it actually added some lightness to the meal.  The biscuit and gravy were not as savory as I thought it would have been but were a nice added some dimension.  I personally would have liked to have more gravy and maybe make the flavor a bit more substantial as it got lost with the grits.    The Breakfast Patty ($14) was also quite good, it came with a side of kale salad which I liked.  The sandwich wasn't greasy, bacon could be a touch less salty as it overwhelmed the beef.  The sweet jam they put was a refreshing touch.  We also shared a Pear Pie which was more like a tart, but it was warm and not too sweet topped with a crumble.  Nice way to finish off the meal.  Overall, I'm not sure if I would go back, just because of the wait.  The Diner takes me back to the 70's where food was simple and good, if you're looking for something different in the area I would give it a try."}
{"text":"Very yummy. My second time here and it was truly delicious. I would be back again for sure! Yum"}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner! And yes, I've been there for those occasions. I think I've try 80% of their menu and there wasn't a dish/meal I didn't enjoy. I loveeeee their potato rosti, normally I trench my hash browns with a mixture of ketchup and hot sauce but not here! The rosti taste amazing on its own! Oh and the warm squash salad is to die for, I'm a sucker for butternut squash so there's no way I wasn't gonna try it. Make sure you save room for the homemade donuts - it's not cheap (not Tim Hortons pricing) but it's worth very penny. They are so decadent! I feel like I've used a lot of \"!!!\" in my review but trust me they are that good and requires all the \"!!!\" to make my point!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The care and quality put into each dish is so apparent with each bite. I actually love it more for dinner than the brunch it is better known for. The pork chop, asparagus with romesco sauce, tri-tip special, charred broccoli all hit it out of the ballpark!  And special kudos to the baker! The dinner roll with the pork chop was not some mundane filler but    hands down the best dinner roll I've ever had! The amazing crust with the perfect texture and crunch opens up to the soft warm delicious centre. When a restaurant takes such care on the sides you know this place is a winner.  And every single dessert kills it too. Sticky toffee, rhubarb tart just insanely good. Love the little details like how the tart is still warm. Importantly, the prices are very reasonable (take note Ruby Watchco and especially Peasant Table!) as are the portions. The only Queen East restaurant I would go to regularly for the food rather than misguided local boosterism."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch spot in Toronto. Griddle cakes are delicious - not to sweet, the crispy bacon hits the spot and the hash brown is something special. Service is excellent - friendly and attentive. I'll be waiting to come back here on my next visit!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant on a Sunday for brunch based on the Yelp reviews.  There were 3, then 5 of us since our 2 youngest kids joined us late in the meal.  The restaurant was great in all regards with the exception of the rather long wait, which was about 35 min.  In fact, my 2 youngest kids could not wait and ate at pizza pizza next door.  We killed time, browsing at neighbourhood shops.  When we were finally seated, service was quick and the food, delicious.  I had the Lily White standard and my husband and daughter each had the English-ish.   Everyone enjoyed their meals and they were ample.   By dessert, my 2 other kids joined us and the waitress was very accommodating seating them, even bringing over an extra chair.    We finished with the home made doughnuts (Boston cream) and we all thought they were tasty.  I cook a lot myself and have high standards and expectations around freshness and creativity.  I would rate the food quality quite high.   Though substantial, the meal was not heavy.  My meal was a nice treatment of a standard offering: bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast.  Our waitress got top marks for her pleasant disposition and quick service.  Overall, nice little place.  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favourite places.  They are doing everything right. Went there tonight and had their pork chop, delicious, perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Charming, cozy venue, small menu, good features, friendly service... the food is solid (Turkey Club and Patty Melt) were great, and drink features nightly, worth a visit."}
{"text":"This place saddened me, as I had great memories of the first time we were here. This time, although service was friendly, they made some errors - for example, didn't tell us what was sold out until we ordered it from the menu (hate that). The menu reads confusingly -- it says \"biscuits. Gravy\" (you get both, but there's a period) but also \"bacon. Sausage\" but you have to pick one or the other, you don't get both. Need to be more careful with their punctuation and presentation.    While my Reuben was mighty, there's no way it was worth $17. I think $13 is more reasonable for a sandwich.  Since I no longer feel the price matches the product, I had to adjust my review."}
{"text":"We're not five-star people If you want a tasty meal in a little diner-style place, this is a great choice We had a couple of cocktails that were quite tasty We tried the charred broccoli as an appetizer. Very fresh broccoli charred and swimming in a savory sauce We then had the special, a delicious, succulent pot roast. If they got it when you're there, get it! Deserts were tasty They promise comfort food and that's what you get, very well-done Service is attentive but not hovering Strongly recommended"}
{"text":"We came here tonight for dinner. It opened only a month ago, but you'd never know it. The food and service were seamless. With about 29 seats, this place can get busy fast, especially for brunch, we hear. The menu is comfort food, with an emphasis on brunch items, but also some solid choices for lunch and dinner in the way of sandwiches and \"patty melts\", an assortment of patties served on incredibly yummy breads: toasted, buttery, amazing breads. We ordered the charred broccoli and WOW, was it ever amazing. A sauce with a kick made this dish so, so good. By the end of that and my Breakfast Patty Melt (with a burger, bacon and an egg and more), I was stuffed :) Great portion sizes. My Manhattan was expertly prepared, too. The wines and beers are thoughtfully chosen as well. Loved the music and the general vibe. All in all this local spot is great, and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow White Lily, wow! For breakfast it was the best we had while in town for a 4 day visit. Exceeded expectations in every way. Would return in a heartbeat, and almost did during this trip. After a beautiful breakfast presentation, we finished with one of their famous donuts, and what a delightful treat it was, truly a fine baked good offering!"}
{"text":"Food: 4/5 Donuts: 5/5  So why the 1 star?   White Lily diner is a fairly newcomer in Riverside; their donuts and buttermilk pancakes are delicious. Overall, the food, vibe, and donuts make it a good brunch destination.  This negative review is in response to how management handled the following situation.  My friend and I were having a great time until it quickly went very sour upon finding a very cute DEAD LADYBUG in her hashbrown.   When this was addressed with our server, she deferred it to the diner manager who only responded with a blank stare. Instead of being apologetic and immediately removing the plate, she responded with, \"Well ,what would you like me to do about it?\"   Well, I don't know. You're in the service industry, allegedly, and perhaps this kitchen might clearly need a health inspection, so this means you should either, 1. Immediately remove the plate & bring us food that's not contaminated with dead bugs and, at minimum 2. Not charge us for this item.  The manager acted as though she did us a favor by replacing the dish. When the bill came, we noticed that we were still charged for the item and decided to bring it up with her again to simply express that, while we would gladly pay for the dish, from a CUSTOMER SERVICE standpoint and good business practice, the situation was not handled properly at all.  The manager gave us the most horrendous attitude and acted defensively. She even had the audacity to tell us that this was a \"family run\" business and them giving us a new dish was costing them money."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch food, rich tasty coffee, great service, nice bathroom, highly recommend:"}
{"text":"A small but nearly perfect brunch spot.   The recipes are so interesting and the quality is tops.   The patty melt was insane.   Mandatory for brunch lovers."}
{"text":"Literally LOVE this spot. Every dish is delicious, unique, and SO satisfying. I almost don't want to write this so I can have the place to myself - the world must know!!"}
{"text":"3 stars only because the service was amazing. The servers were efficient, prompt and very friendly. The food is more of a 2.5 stars out of 5. Went here on sat Jan 14 at around lunch time. We had one small orange juice which was good, the english-ish and their thick version of pancakes. The pancakes was a bit doughy in the middle but the flavour of it was quite nice. My friend had the english-ish and was disappointed. The mushrooms tasted too vinegary. Wish it was made with more garlic and butter. The banger which was one piece of fat sausage tasted a bit sour. The scramble eggs was basic enough but what was most disappointing on the plate was the undercooked greasy hash brown. We had to go somewhere quickly afterwards so we didn't complain about our food but just ate what we could. I'm quite sure the server would have made our hash browns and dish over if we had said something. My friend ended up having diarrhea two hours later and didn't eat anything after the diner. I wonder if anyone else had stomach issue after eating on Saturday Jan 14? The bill was about 27 dollars, a bit steep for the portions we had which wasn't all that big. We left 5 dollars tip because the service was great and the tip should always reflect how well you were served not on the food itself.  If I had more time.. I would have sent both plates back to make everything a bit more cooked. This place deserves another chance and there are a few other items on the menu I would like to try. I don't like giving bad reviews but my friend throwing up all evening yesterday compelled me to write this honest review. I hope I can write a better review if I ever come back. But the hash browns should never be under. People rather wait for good quality food then maybe rushing it because u guys are busy. Don't know if it's the sausage or eggs that made my friend sick... but we still wish u guys a lot of luck!"}
{"text":"I am always looking for great diners and with the White Lily I think I have found one. The quality of the food was fantastic and everything was better than standard diner fare. My only complaint is that menu is very small. I would hazard to guess that they would say that was to make a few things well is better than having an extensive menu"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. I just happened to walk by on my way to a different restaurant and peeked inside. Not a huge menu but they hit the mark with my dish. Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen also really looked good. The added bonus is they make their own donuts which are really good.  The other thing I noticed which most people won't notice or care is that they have Hewitts chocolate milk which is fantastic. I will be back for sure to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"It's a nice little space and diner. Service was great. I had the standard breakfast with bacon and my friends had one with sausage. The meats were definitely higher quality. My bacon wasn't a thin, barely there crisp - it was some real bacon. The sausage was also substantial. Not surprising as they source their meats from The Butchers of Distinction. While it is expensive to eat there, it was quality food (justified)."}
{"text":"White Lily Diner is a welcome addition to the neighborhood, especially since they serve breakfast all day. This was my second time going there; the first time was when they first opened, and it is now infinitely busier than it was at the beginning. My husband and I went for a late lunch at almost 2pm and we still had to wait for seats! (Good for them though, and well-deserved success.)  I ordered the White Lily Standard breakfast with scrambled eggs and sausage. The hash brown was amazingly crispy! The sausage was also very tasty. I don't usually order scrambled eggs, but I'm pregnant and can't eat runny eggs... I didn't have to worry though, their scrambled eggs are cooked perfectly. The rye bread is also worth mentioning; it is excellent bread, much better than what I'd expect to get with breakfast.    My husband ordered the meatloaf. I hadn't ever tried meatloaf before this, because I always had visions of school cafeteria grey, overcooked meatloaf, but I tried a bite and am very happy to say that White Lily Diner's meatloaf is delicious."}
{"text":"Had a short wait for a party of 4 for Sunday brunch. Cozy space. Their donuts are worth a try as they make them in house. The rest of the brunch is pretty good too. It is good, but if the wait time is more than an hr, I would go somewhere else. There are also a couple coffee shops in the area if you want to sit there and wait."}
{"text":"Tried this place recently, the space isn't huge but that is part of its charm. The menu has an American South vibe (grits, biscuits, sausage gravy) and my fam and I tried it all, yummy stuff. My SO had a breakfast patty melt and while messy it was lick the plate delicious (love the poblano relish). They had some cool sounding dinner specials so we'll definitely come back for a night meal. Highly re"}
{"text":"Everything I have had here is on point! The meatloaf is comfort food at it's finest; it's warming, very filling and packed with flavour - Great for our cold Canadian winters.  In a word - fantastic. The biscuits and gravy are super tasty as is the patty melt!"}
{"text":"Really great neighbourhood diner with unique offerings. My favourite is the smoked fish and hash brown. I ordered the sausage only because it was homemade and it was very good. Fresh bread baked in the premises. Decent wine. Good prices. Awesome tunes. Pretty good go to type of place. Crowds in the weekend."}
{"text":"Very busy on Saturday at 11 am, and it got busier later on. Be prepared to wait in line like any other good brunch places.  My fiance and I both ordered the same dish: Southern ($13).Tight presentation on the plate, nothing crazy or boring. Loved their biscuit! It was flaky and comforting. White corn grits was seasoned well but wish it was a bit more creamier as I bit into a couple lumps. Gravy was light and seasoned well. Bacon strips were thick, crispy, and flavorful. Eggs were cooked to perfection although one of the yolks was served broken. Their house-made hot sauce was great. The staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday evening and found the restaurant almost empty, music blaring. The food was excellent and reasonably priced. The meatloaf was terrific, the pastrami sandwich delicious. Donuts for dessert were great. A pleasant surprise all round."}
{"text":"Terrific family friendly diner in Leslieville. Friendly service, warm vibe and spotless counter. Food is surprisingly interesting for comfort fare: the dinner rolls with the meatloaf were delicious with a hint of garlic butter, while the patty melt came with a zippy aioli on equally scrumptious toast. Our seven year old devoured eggs and sausage for dinner.  Sold out of donuts, must come back!"}
{"text":"White Lily Diner Was just strolling through the 'hood, man It just popped up here  Got people all over All pumped up and excited New east side brunch place  Keeping it all down  With much classic diner grub Simple, elegant  They call them 'patty melts' Burger patties swished in bread  Sandwiches, salads  And it was all good Even does shredded hash browns  Mmmm, bacon, pastrami  They too like to bake Breads, doughnuts, pies, butter tarts  They got you all warm  Small, unpretentious Aiming to keep it classic Quick, with great service  (Would be nice if they had a bit more food on the menu though)  [TTC: egg on over on a 501-2-3 or King streetcar to Queen/Broadview]"}
{"text":"Place is amazing. Literally everything on the menu is awesome. Good music and great atmosphere. Have to get the breakfast patty melt."}
{"text":"Serious brunch, come hungry! I feel like as brunch has proliferated throughout the general population, the quality has gone down and the portions are smaller. Every place out there is serving \"brunch\" with a single piece of avocado toast or one waffle the size of an Eggo for $18 a plate. I hate this. I want decadent, ample, generous brunch, and I want to sit and enjoy it. White Lily is PERFECT for this. The patty melt is absolutely delicious, and it's enough food for two meals. YES gimme, it's the best. Sooo tasty! And original, not something you can get all over town. This. Makes White Lily destination brunch for me, we are willing to trek over from the west side for it. Worth it!   Also, they make lovely, adorable doughnuts here. The doughnuts are typically raised rounds without holes, sometimes filled, two flavours available per day. Soft, excellent dough, not greasy - just delicious. I've tried many different flavours, the vanilla cream filled were the best. Be sure to order as soon as you sit down! Love. ;)"}
{"text":"White Lily Diner has the classic diner feel and some good options on their breakfast menu for you to stick to the breakfast staples. I got the English-ish, which came with your typical toast and eggs, some mushrooms and in-house made sausage. All their meat is smoked and cured in house. Sadly I didn't really enjoy the sausage, so probably should've opted for the bacon instead. They also have the option of ordering just a bowl of their house made pickles, which whenever there's a menu with pickles I'm sold!! Would come again for a nice laid back Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"I feel a bit bitter about waiting 35 min next to the front door which was freezing!  ..and then being seated next to the door which was only slightly less cold... But I can't write a (totally) negative review because the food was really something, and our waitress was nice. We had the Breakfast sandwich, Meatloaf, sausage side, and broccoli salad - The Meatloaf was very flavourful. The side salad that came with the meal tasted great, but the leaves were way too big to eat without a knife (and I think I found a blade of grass in my salad, which was unusual...) so I'll conclude by saying this place has great food but a reservation and a scarf are almost certainly a necessity"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast , the server was nice and attentive got the white lily standard and breakfast patty melt both were amazing and good portions. definitely go here if your hungry you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were there last night for dinner. He's a fan of meatloaf and I found this restaurant on yelp.ca as a restaurant which serves it (very few restaurants in town serve meatloaf , or do a good job at it). A modern diner White Lily is, with decor and chairs and tables reminiscent of retro ones. Lauren, the server, was pleasant and attentive and the food was very good. My boyfriend was pleased with his meatloaf and I loved my steak which was cooked exactly the way I asked for (medium well) and which came with amazing hash browns. Our appetizer too, was 3 yummy biscuits served with sausage gravy, something we have never had before. And for dessert, we shared a rhubarb tart & 2 buttertarts which were fantastic & not overly sweet . Thumbs up to the owner, Ben, whose name I found out from Lauren..  There are so many restaurants which have opened up in Toronto and most of them you go once and not plan on going back...We are definitely going back to White Lily Diner ! And soon!"}
{"text":"Popped in for a late lunch / early dinner. And between us, had the meatloaf, an all day breakfast, and the patty melt.  All were great, the patty melt won. Good diner food. Emphasis on the \"comfort\".  My only complaint was the speaker (playing good blues) was right above our heads and we could hardly hear each other."}
{"text":"Almost perfect at what it does.  Smart comfort food served in a polished yet casual way.     A place that you go to for the food.  A place where you can taste the quality in the ingredients.  Patty melts are my Kryptonite."}
{"text":"Long wait but food was good.  Their menu was a good mix of sweet and savoury.  Neighborhood gem!  Will go again!"}
{"text":"Yummm...   We quite literally ordered half the menu because we got a little too enthusiastic. It's breakfast style comfort food at its finest. Complete with the ever-American grits.   Service was so nice, the place is clean and simple, and they were very kind and patient with our toddlers.  Not much for vegetarian, but a bunch of the sides will keep you happy.   Nothing is hugely unique flavors, but for us it was all well done, really tasty, and great if you're super hungry. A very nice alternative to the madness that is Lady Marmalade."}
{"text":"Came here on a friday morning at 11am during the holiday season and the restaurant was packed with two parties of 2 ahead of us.   From what I can tell, there are approximately 30 seats with 2 servers and no hostess. We stood around for 5 minutes before anyone came over to ask us to put our names down. It felt some what disorganized as there were a bunch of people waiting and people that came in after us tried to get their name down first. Pretty annoying. Also, both servers seem to manage the list, which causes some confusion. Server #1 told us that it'd be about 15 minutes (but it was closer to 20-25). Then server #2 took the names of people that came after us and told them a shorter time, so I wouldn't really trust their estimates.   Given that the ratio is 15 patrons to 1 server, service here is decent, but not great. We sat at the bar. A person got seated beside me at a dirty spot - It wasn't cleaned up from the last customer. With that said, the servers are nice/friendly and doing what they can in an understaffed situation. They're new, so I hope these are just early kinks.   This place serves comfort-style food (think biscuits and meatloaf) and was very tasty. Most breakfast options ranged from $11-13, which is pretty affordable. I had the English-ish, which was very tasty. The eggs were poached perfectly and the bangers were tasty. I wish the hash browns were slightly crispier, but overally pretty good. I talso ried the pancakes, which were very fluffy and tasty as well. Good sized portions, almost leaning towards too big.   Overall, tasty food in a clean feeling/looking environment. Just wish their processes/service was slightly better."}
{"text":"Just finished an amazing brunch @whitelilydiner - super friendly service, bright comfortable decor, incredible handmade bacon / sausages, perfect eggs, and silky smooth grits. Perfect Brunch! #goodeats, #grits, #brunch, #416, #riverdale #leslieville"}
{"text":"Very good. House made bread and delicious  donuts to get me started. Pancakes were good to share and I had the \"English\" brekkie. I also had a taste of the \"breakfast\" burger.... my goodness it was good!  Small quaint joint with all day brunch menu. Expect to wait for a bit. But worth it if you're not 'too' hungry."}
{"text":"This little Riverside diner has just became one of my top favourite brunch place!   Our party of 4 arrived at White lily at 1 pm trying to avoid the brunch rush hour, no surprise, it was still 30 mins wait.  It was a nice day so we didn't mind walking around Riverside and wait for a phone call when our table is ready.   Now on to my favourite part, the food, it was delicious!!! I ordered the Standard with sausage (other choices are bacon or mushroom) and the hubby ordered the pancakes. Let's start with the Standard, two over easy eggs on crunchy potato hash serve with tasty in-house sausage and top off with crunchy toast, uncomplicated and just simply amazing. And then there was the pancakes, Mildred's pancakes are the best pancakes in TO IMO but these pancakes are a close second. Super fluffy and tasty.   Service was good, prices are fair. The only negative is there was no AC and on a 30 degrees day, we were dying. I guess it didn't help being seated near the kitchen."}
{"text":"After reading many reviews about this place from fellow yelpers, decided to give this place a shot for breakfast since we were going to in be area.  Decor  Very unique place, the place has a very cozy feel.  Service  Very friendly staff, we were promptly seated, it did get quite busy while we were their, so be prepared for lineups.  Food  The presentation of the food was well done (pictures attached). However I did find breakfast choices were very few. The food did taste great though, nothing special.  Seating  We had 4 people in our party and the booths they have are very tight, not very comfortable for 4, so keep that in mind if your coming with a party of 4.  Overall it was good, the reviews give it more credit than it deserves"}
{"text":"Their breakfast was really good, and the portions are quite big. Their in house baker make their own bread and doughnuts. We will definitely be back for their all day breakfast option!!"}
{"text":"More like 4.5. Definitely be there before 10 if you wanted to be seated right away! I got there at 10:05 for brunch and had to wait 40 minutes. Service was good and the hash browns were delicious."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, it could have been because I haven't eaten out in a while. I had the beef hash and the wife had the grits and it was all spot on. Definitely will be coming back again and I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really love this brunch spot on the east end. I was hoping it would remain under the radar a bit longer, but after last Saturday visit, it is clear everyone on the east end knows about this place too.  The food is excellent and the prices are great. I am definitely going to try this place for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Fantastic little hole-in-the-wall, off the beaten path but super convenient vis transit, well worth coming out for to enjoy diner basics \"taken up a notch!\"  There's beer and wine, the staff is super, and the food is: perfect. A stack of pancakes with bacon piled in a pool of maple syrup with maple-flavored whipped butter on the side? My idea of breakfast diner heaven. Did I dine with a salad lover? Yes I did, and she was just as happy.  The place is small, so go early - we got there at 10:45 and we ate well and were ready to Take On The Day."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! Definitely a must when visiting Toronto. Everything we ordered was delicious and filling. I would recommend the standard breakfast with sausage, burger, and donuts."}
{"text":"Amazing! At first glance the restaurant is a bit mundane, but WHO CARES?!? The food is excellent! Went on a Saturday eve. and had the special of pot roast. The meat was so tender and full full full of flavour. Drinks were quite good as well. Would definitely go back. And for the price, it's the best value in the area!"}
{"text":"Situated on Queen East just a walk away from Broadview Ave, White Lily Diner is a small diner that serves up classic comfort food. I had heard about the rave reviews from others and was excited to try it for myself.  My boyfriend and I stopped by White Lily Diner at around 11:30am on a Sunday morning. The place was already full of customers but that did not stop us from putting our name down on the waitlist (we were only the 2nd ones in line!). They suggested that we go for coffee instead of waiting at the diner and that they would call us once a table was ready. We headed to get coffee and as came back to the restaurant, we were told that a table was ready for us. Once seated we were greeted promptly and told the specials of the day. Once ordered, the food came at reasonable time.   These are the items we ordered: - Doughnuts of the day - they are baked in house and a great little bite to start or end the meal. The doughnut flavours of the day were chocolate peanut butter and vanilla dip. Hands down the chocolate peanut butter donut won. - Juice of the day - I ordered the juice of the day which consisted of beets, carrots, lemons, ginger, and apples. Great refreshing juice with a good kick to it (from the ginger). - Breakfast sandwich - thick cut bacon, sunny egg, tomato, mayo, lettuce on country white bread. - Pastrami sandwich, with sour pickle and deli mustard on rye.  Overall, the food is solid and delicious; I had the breakfast sandwich and it was filling; the thick cut bacon was heavenly. The bread they use amazing held the sandwich together and didn't get soggy from the mayo they used. Although the sandwiches were a bit messy to eat, the waitress was amazingly attentive as she brought us more napkins without us asking for them.   Overall, the vibe of the place is relaxing and laid back and service was friendly and attentive. I can see why there are rave reviews of this place and lines out the door."}
{"text":"Very tasty food and friendly service!  What more could you ask for?  We enjoyed our breakfasts very much and will return to try some dinner items.  The doughnuts are yummy!"}
{"text":"Came here with no expectations and left with a belly full of delicious brunch. Not a ton of options so hopefully you're not a picky eater. They specialize in donuts so we ordered one of the doughnuts of the day -- a icing sugar dusted donut with lemon filling. I'm not a huge donut fan but I am known to indulge on occasion. The lemon custard was unusually yellow, almost like an egg yolk, but was tart and not super sweet. The donut was soft and tasted fresh. It's on the expensive side for donuts at $2.50 each... I ordered the southern breakfast. The biscuit was excellent. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The grits were not super flavourful. I think that's what the gravy was for. On the other hand the bacon was a little salty for my tastebuds but cooked the way I like it - soft and not too crispy. The hash brown from the white lily standard was delicious. It is served under the rest of the breakfast but was just crispy enough. They use a finely grated potato to make it. Retro looking booths are a bit cozy for my liking. They have high chairs available for the little ones and it is loud enough in there that you can eat comfortably even if your baby was fussing a bit like mine was! Service was just right. Would eat here again and try their juice of the day!"}
