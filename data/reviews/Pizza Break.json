{"text":"I go to this place very often, and there's a reason for that. The pizza tastes very good without taking a hit on the price. For the taste and quality, it's fairly cheap. The staff and owner are incredibly nice people. They deliver for a mere $3 delivery fee.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It's a family-run business.  Friendly service and delicious pizza.  As mentioned by another yelper, their pies are not greasy.  Will definitely be back.

*I'm deducting 1 star off for the wings; they're your garden variety frozen wings that are baked in the pizza oven when you place your order.  It's soggy and not crispy.  But then again, it's kinda my fault ordering wings at the neighbourhood pizza shop, i shoulda just stuck with ordering pizzas only."}
{"text":"Literlly best pizza ever . Tastes like home . Try the Margaritta and Woodbridge pizza , THE BEST"}
{"text":"Scrumptious delicious pizza with an amazing base and crust from a family-owned pizza. One of the best pizzas in my opinion in Toronto from a very sweet owner!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza!  It always tastes fresh,  and makes me crave for more. I highly recommend Super Pesto Pizza :) Mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Best take out pizza 9.99 for a large with 3 toppings...nice and fresh...friendly staff too"}
{"text":"So good you almost wanna eat there everyday. Small location but amazing food and such friendly staff. Pretty fair prices and fast delivery. They make the pizza so fast even if you walk in and order. Very fresh toppings. Good deals with wings too."}
{"text":"The BEST take-out pizza I've ever had. Large pizza with 3 toppings was 9.99 + tax. Was ready in 10 min. The pizza crust tasted similar to a baguette and loved it. Crunchy and soft at the same time. I did not need a dipping sauce for the crust edge. It is chewy and tasty all the way to the end. Toppings were generous. The owner was friendly and nice. Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"In town for my wife's birthday. We ordered a pizza and garlic bread. It was awesome!! Delivery was pretty quick as well. I would buy pizza here always if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"I don't usually crave pizza but I crave this place's pizza.  Owner operated. Friendly and clean. Definitely worth the drive there."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Vaughan! The thin crust dough is outstanding. It's in a location that's not visible from the street but definitely worth going to."}
{"text":"Pizza Break is by far one of the rarest places that offers both good food and service.

It is hidden in a plaza that doesn't have much traffic. That's why it's a treasure.

The owner (Mikey) understands and values customers.

I've ordered (pick-up)multiple times here and it never disappoints.  Consistent all the time.

The toppings are generous and baked perfectly.

Price is very affordable and reasonable. Sometimes, I want to give more for what I'm getting.

I can't say it enough, Mikey values every customer. I always feel welcomed whenever I come into his establishment.

All around a great guy and his business shows it.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza ever! And so cheap! We bought an extra large Mediterranean pizza for $19! Will def be ordering again! The gem of Woodbridge!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza .
Hot and fresh ; walk in special was perfectly cooked. 
Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Their large pizza 3 topping special is everything! 

I don't find myself craving pizza much, but when I do this is one of the places I go to. It's located quite close to my house so the location is very convenient. I believe the owner is an older man and he is always SO friendly. Frankly, he's the reason why I find myself coming back (I mean, other than their delicious pizza) 

I haven't tried any of their other foods, but if their pizza is anything to go by I'm sure it's just as amazing. 

Hopefully my pizza craving comes back soon so I can make a pit stop here.. Haha."}
{"text":"I went to this place based on the reviews on Yelp where it got a rare 5 stars. The price for the pizza was good at $10 for a large with three toppings. I was excited to try it but was somewhat disappointed. I didn't like the taste of the pepperoni and found the pizza overall pretty bland. I was expecting more. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great price. great pizza and great staff. Ordered to pick up but as weather is cold i requested if we can sit down as pizza will get cold. They were very welcoming and made us feel welcomed. The pizza dough is amazing and very different from other pizza places we have been in same price range :)"}
{"text":"For starters, the place smelled incredible when we walked in.  Great selection of toppings and some interesting gourmet options. We ordered a sweet chili and it turned out to be the perfect combo of sweet and spicy. And this might be the perfect pizza crust - soft on the inside but crispy on the outside.  Delicious! Def gonna order here again."}
{"text":"The garlic bread with cheese is amazing. It's like a mini pizza and it's so cheap! 
The pizza for the price is also good. We got a large for $9.99 with three toppings. The only thing is I asked for thin crust and I think it was just regular."}
{"text":"It was awesome such a great crust and the bacon strips were perfect with the right amount of crisp"}
{"text":"Always great, always affordable.  Loads of toppings and full of flavour.  I usually get this pizza delivered.  Very courteous delivery men, quick and efficient.  One con:  Ask for well-done crust, because it can come out somewhat doughy."}
{"text":"Ok so my son and I ordered pizza and wings from here the other night, the wings where all burnt and tasted funny, the pizza was ok nothing special."}
{"text":"Great local place for affordable but delicious pizza. It's a great alternative for Pizza Pizza if you're on a budget but want something good."}
{"text":"Great family owned pizza place. Unbeatable quality, price, and service. Definete go to spot for amazing za"}
{"text":"I was craving pizza on Friday and decided to stop by. I normally order takeout and have ordered from this place three times previously. My go to is a medium pizza with pepperoni, pineapple and tomato but this time I decided to try out the pizza and wings combo. Fridays are busy and my wait time was 45mins. Previous visits were a 15min wait. 

A steady flow of customers would walk in to pick up their order and they all greeted the owner by name so I guess they are regulars. Another thing I noticed was that a customer that came in and ordered 15mins after me received her order before me so I don't know if she received special treatment because she's a regular or that my pizza just took longer to cook lol. 

The pizza here have always been perfectly cooked and the crust crispy and this time it was no different. The wings on the other hand were disappointing and lacking. They were on the smaller end and for a couple dollars more, I would rather get wings at All Stars.  

Whenever I have a pizza craving, I'll come back."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint in all of Vaughan.

They deliver hot and fresh, and their pizza is just amazing. The Gourmet (with bacon added) is the perfect pizza IMO.

We've ordered here many times, including for birthday parties, and the extended family has always been impressed.

They've messed up a delivery order once or twice but when we call them they are super apologetic and immediately correct the issue.

Love this place, they have a customer for life. 

(To be fair I've only tried pizza, I can't comment on wings, sides, etc)"}
{"text":"Very rude over the phone. We called to ask, if they deliver to our area and the person who answered the phone just answered 'No.Thanks, bye!' and hung up even before we got a chance to ask another question. Too bad for them, they've just lost our family as a customer."}
{"text":"Amazing service, and pizza everytime. Never disappointed, and friendly staff that feels like family."}
{"text":"I try to order my 3 toppings pizza and it looked amazing. I took the bite and wow the flavour just exploded in my mouth. The owner was very nice to his customers and great customer service. Inside it was clean and so as the washrooms. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and the friendliest owners! I don't live in this area but I would definitely come here for the food and service. Toppings are generous and fresh and the pizza crust isn't greasy (tastes better than Pizza Hut pan pizza!)"}
{"text":"After visiting Canada's Wonderland, we wanted to find a place to grab a bite. Came across this place on yelp and give it a try. The place is small, mostly people come and get their take put orders. There are seceral tables if you want to dine in but definitely not for bigger group.

They have 3 topping L pizza at 9.99. Love the sauce they use. The pizza taste really good, you notice the freshness on all the ingredients used.  We ordered the chicken wings and really surprised on how small it is compare to other places. 

The staff are really nice . I wpuld recommend the place for pizza"}
{"text":"Huge pizza for a great price with lots of toppings.  $15.99 for an extra large 3 topping pizza.  $10 for a large.   $5 for a medium pepperoni (pick up only) - for the price of a happy meal a medium pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Was at Canadian's Wonderland was ready to leave used yep and found this little place.I ordered on the way out. Guy was great and the price was real nice. Wings my wife and kids loved.h highly recommend. AAA +++"}
{"text":"I'd rate it a 4, but my wife, son(1of2) and sister would not have that.
The price $. Lowest in Vaughan.
Service excellent, fast friendly.
Taste good not great, I think my other family members are blinded by the price.
Toppings if you get the special walkin(4.99) you'll get fewer toppings, vs regular fare(I'm not complaining just stating a fact)
Location, small quiet plaza, difficult to get out of during dinner rush(blaming the not so courteous drivers on the road). 

Been lots of times, today just did the cheap 4.99 medium walkout(you can call it in and pick it up unlike the giant chain that has the same for 5.99, they're a 2 star, I don't think the 7.99 \"authentic Italian\" place let me call it in either)

Will return 
do recommend"}
{"text":"Just ordered a Large pizza from 'Pizza Break' through Skip The Dishes. This was my first time ordering from this place, so I thought I would try something new rather than my usual pizza choice.

I was NOT disappointed, the pizza looked and tasted great!
It was stated that it would take about 60 minutes to
Arrive, but the whole delivery took about 38 minutes from the moment I placed my order, to the tome it arrived.

The portion is larger than the usual standard, I order a thin crust which was made really great..and since this was my first time, I went a little far with the toppings and they all tasted so well and worked all together.

Delivery was fast, and presentation of the pizza was very appetizing.

I will certainly try them again in the near future."}
{"text":"Did a quick take out order of one large pizza to try this place out because of the high reviews and I can say I wasn't disappointed!  The large pizza was only $9.99 and we got three toppings on it; artichokes, spinach, and chicken.  It was cooked and ready for us by the time we requested for over the phone.

The pizza itself was very well made with the ingredients being fresh. You wont be disappointed by the quality and taste of this pizza. And plus it's cheap and worth it!"}
{"text":"Was driving by this plaza one day and noticed a sign for pizza advertising a great price for a large. Pulled in. I normally go just around the other side of this building (in the same plaza) and get a pizza from Amici's, but thought that I'd give this place a try.
I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised.
I don't know whether the owners are trying to attract business, but the value for the price is amazing. Generous toppings...and fresh.
Have been back 2 other times since my initial visit and have been happy with every pizza."}
{"text":"I was feeling lazy after orchestra rehearsal on Sunday evening, so I decided to try Pizza Break. There were a few ongoing specials. The takeout special was $10 for a large pizza with 3 toppings. I decided on mushrooms, chicken, and Italian sausage for the toppings. 20 minutes later and it's ready for pick up. It's in the same plaza as Ay Caramba, so it was easy to find. The restaurant is pretty small with only a few tables. It's definitely a take out joint.

When I took a bite into the first slice of pizza, I could taste the freshness of the ingredients. The fresh tomato sauce really popped out the most. The crust was crunchy on the outside yet with a slight softness on the inside. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Dropped in for their 3 topping for $9.99 deal. Very nice guys, very accommodating, they had no issue counting gourmet toppings as one (rather than 2) and any combination of toppings over multiple pizza's were acceptable. 
I'm not sure about the stone baked pizza, my pizza was made in a regular oven, although they did have a stone oven, perhaps it is on request? There are a few tables there if you want to dine in, not much room for families or groups. They seem to do mostly take out business.
The pizza taste was pretty good for the price,(definitely worth a visit over any chain store), the ingredients were fresh and the overall pizza was better than most. I'd say this place delivers a great pizza for the price."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza and wings from pizza break. It was first time ordering there. I was satisfied the way they took my order. They where polite. They where on time with my order. They said 40 minutes and it was here in 40 minutes not like some of those other places that are always late or lost. Anyways they got my order right the pizza was terrific and the wings where terrific and the delivery guy was great to. One more bonus was that they don't charge you extra if you have to pay with debit or credit which is an awesome thing. I will definitly order from here again and i will tell people i know to order here and try there food. Best pizza ever."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff who seem interested in their customer's adventures. 

Good pizza, but they really need to evaluate the dipping sauce. It is some kind of commercial crap that tastes horrible and certainly has questionable ingredients. No refillable fountain drinks nor cups with ice. I guess it is more of a carry out place."}
{"text":"ordered from this place a couple of pizza's for work on a Saturday, was very happy to have the delivery come very quickly. this hot pizza was very flavorful and the crest/dough was very light. everything about this pizza was absolutely awesome, but this location did mess up on cutting the party sized pizza. they managed to cut the pizza up and down, but not left to right. would definitely order again from them, as the flavors were outstanding!"}
{"text":"3 topping large pizza 9.99. Good quality toppings, tasty chewy dough, fresh tomato sauce even with little tomato bits. Friendly pizza man. Nothing more to say"}
