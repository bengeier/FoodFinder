{"text":"NONSMOKERS BEWARE!!!
I live in the Leslieville neighbourhood, and have seen countless restaurants come and go in this site over the last very few years. This one is destined to follow. So don't waste your time and money here.

In early February, I was looking for a local restaurant to host a group \"goodbye\" lunch. I dropped in here just at 12:00 (when they weren't yet open for brunch, but DID open for lunch at 11:30 am).

As soon as I walked in the door, the STENCH of both old and fresh cigarette smoke made me immediately gag. The waiter (desperate for business) ran over to seat me. When I complained, he just said \"Sorry! Must be someone in the kitchen.\"

Now, you can't fool an ex-smker of 27 years. This wasn't just a \"one -off\" of one lowly dishwasher smoking before the place opened. This was hours of smoking in the main dining room, no fresh air let in.

And unless I'm mistaken, there is now a LAW that prohibits smoking in the workplace. I told him why I was leaving, and why i wouldn't be back.

Don't waste your time here; support someplace that considers the comfort of its patrons."}
{"text":"I was here once. The food was pretty solid and the service was friendly, but not great.  It was a weekend lunch, there were very few people in the restaurant.

We ordered, one order required three clarifications in two different trips, and one ended up wrong at the end. One diner finished her food before the rest of the food arrived.

Basically, I'm not yet sure if the issues we experienced are systemic, or we just had an off day. The food was good enough that I'd try it again, but it also wasn't so good that I feel the need to recommend the place."}
{"text":"Two and a half years after opening, this place has really turned itself around!!

My husband and I moved into the area & visited for dinner when Pertino first opened and we thought \"good value and pretty good food\".

Well, things have changed since then...

We now say, \"great food at a great price\" (they haven't upped their price even though the quality has improved 5-fold).

Their menu is almost all 100% fresh, unfrozen using local ingredients. Very few of their pastas are dried and the quality of their ingredients is impecable. Take their caesar salad for example - fresh dressing every day, well balanced acidity and a heavy and tasty punch of garlic. Wonderful.

My hubby and I visited for lunch and had homemade, fresh lasagna (soft and tasty), caesar salad, chicken parmesan sandwich with fresh hot peppers and fries.

Everything was wonderful - we couldn't decide what our favourite was so will have to go back again soon to do it all again!

Nice work, Pertino's!!"}
{"text":"Great for lunch, too!   I came here after going hungry at Voulezvous cafe.   While the tablecloths could use more frequent changing (or just ditching - wiping a tablecloth is much harder than a table) the atmosphere is good.  

I had a great asparagus soup (no cream - and didn't need it) and a big-ass veal sandwich with all of the fixings...   Good stuff!

I saw they do brunch too.  Could be a good alternative to the crusty passive-aggressive Tulip breakfast servers."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once on a week day lunch and once for breakfast while throughly hungover.

The first time I came in it was dead, just me and the staff and they seemed excited to see a face.
I ordered the spaghetti carbonara. It was OK but definitely could have been better. ie. If the panchetta was panchetta and not supermarket bacon. The chief/host/waiter/whatever I seem to recall as the former bartender of The Place 2 B at leslie and queen circa 2003.

My second experience was on the morning of mother's day, I ended up here on a whim with my brother whilst feigning off a hangover before heading to our parents place, and New Town was too packed for my usual greasy spoon drunk feed.
This time the place was packed and to be honest we were lucky to be seated. The staff were definitely in the weeds and weeds they were not used to.
Both of us ordered breakfast, one those ones with everything and a flapjack. it was ok, it took some time, one of my yolks were broken, most of it was cold, the hasbrowns had questionable seasoning, the pancake was over tough and all in all kinda expensive for breakfast.

Take it or leave it."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a higher rating because there were so many things that were spot on, but maybe because it's still a new restaurant it hasn't refined the way it does things yet.  

I went on a thursday but was still able to do the 3 course meal for $19.  I had the house salad with homemade balsalmic vinaigrette dressing and it was good!  My boyfriend had the mushroom soup, which was quite possibly the best mushroom soup I ever tasted: very rich and earthy.

The service was great, seeing that we were the only people there.  I tried the veal with cream sauce and shrimp and a side of spaghetti with sauce.  The veal was overcooked and tasted to me like really rubbery steak. The cream sauce did little to mask this and the mini baby shrimps on top doesn't add to anything.  On top of that, the side of pasta and sauce didn't pull the dish together very well.  

My boyfriend's grill mix was a little better. The sausage was very good and he also got the pasta and sauce as a side.  It also came with chicken that was a little on the dry side and butterfly shrimp.  Again, the plate doesn't pull together very well and just seems like a bunch of things thrown together.

The homemade tiramisu was very good, another reason why I'd like to give them 4 stars but in the end it's the overall experience that matters.  Even with their deal the total came to $45 without drinks and frankly I can think of many other places I can go to within the same price range that is more satisfying."}
