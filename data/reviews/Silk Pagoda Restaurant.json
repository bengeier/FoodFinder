{"text":"Silk Pagoda is one of the few restaurants in Greenfield with actual seating.  However, when you actually sit down in the restaurant you immediately wonder how they stay in business.  Over the half a dozen times that I've been to Silk Pagoda at no time has there been more than three other tables occupied.  Even during prime eating out times. I guess they must either have a very cheap rent or make a killing on their delivery.  Now, on to the food.  It's actually pretty good asian for Pittsburgh.  You can get very spicy food if you want it, something that I've had problems with in Pittsburgh.  It's generally well prepared, but pretty poor presentation. The take it is, well, take out.  It's a little pricey, but very convenient for folks in Greenfield.  So in summary: eat inside if you want an abnormally quiet dinner. Food is okay, but nothing to write to Grandma about. It's a little pricey, but incredibly convenient."}
{"text":"This is my go-to for local take-out or sit down Chinese. I have not tried their delivery because I live so close.  Better than Yen's/China Star or How Lee in my opinion. The food is consistently good. It's not a 5 star restaurant by any means but worth an extra dollar or two for the quality.  As other reviewers have noted, if you go for sit down, you generally have the place to yourself.  For that reason, I like it for business lunch meetings big or small--assuming that you're not recruiting a CEO or something."}
{"text":"Yelp says 2 stars means \"Meh, I've experienced better\", which is exactly how I felt about our dinner from here tonight.  We ordered two entrees, one egg roll, and an order of cheese wontons.  The person on the phone taking our order told us it would take 30 minutes for delivery and did not tell us the price.  We live less than 1.5 miles away and called early (not during the typical dinner-time rush) but the delivery took a bit longer than 30 minutes.  The total was $29.80 before tip, which seems a bit pricey.  The food was just mediocre.  The cheese wontons were okay but the cheese tasted just a bit off.  The tofu homestyle was bland and the sauce had an odd aftertaste.  The only vegetables were carrots, snow peas, and a few small pieces of bamboo, none of which were flavorful.  The Gold Sesame Chicken is described as having a \"sophisticated brown sauce\", but really it was either General Tso's or sweet and sour sauce.  There were two tiny broccoli florets in the dish - did they fall in accidentally?  I wanted to like it - it would be very convenient for me - but it was nothing impressive."}
{"text":"Worse chinese ive ever had and the owner is miserable. I have never in my life sent a plate back- I would rather eat something I hate then send it back.  However, the food was so bad that for the first time in my life I did.  I ordered the family style tofu.  The veggies were cold and the tofu had never touched a pan.  The tofu was so watery- it had not been pressed, it has not been fried, it had just been cut and put on my plate.  It had not even been seasoned.  It was just soy mush. BEFORE I was going to break my own rule, I asked each person at my table familar with the dish from other places to try it.  ALL OF THEM said it was wrong, gross, cold, horrible.  So I finally asked the lady if they could help me.  THE OWNER YELLED AT ME.  \"It is fried, that is fried\" I said, I am sorry but it is cold. She said fine I will take it and cook it better.  I know better then to have someone threaten me and then give them food to give back to me.  I actually don't believe people spit on food, but for the first time in my life- I didn't trust my waiter or the owner.  She was mean, and rude.  So she said- what do i want then? I guess you want some free food then! SHE SAID THAT TO ME- No i already paid for that, so I want something to eat.  Nothing has been free.  She handed me a menu and hovered over me for the entire time, and finally in a rush I just picked an appetizer.  Because I had already picked what i wanted, but it was horrible.  THEY CHARGED ME FOR THE MEAL- NOT THE APPETIZER- a big price difference.    I am a very shy person, and being verbally attacked as a customer was crossing the line.  I will never go back and I always tell my friends to avoid it.    As you can see from my reviews I NEVER rate things badly. I have decided a long time ago, to come on here and help restaurants that I want to do well, when they really do something well, get good reviews.  I keep my mouth shut if i actually don't like a place- I might have ordered badly, I might have misunderstood something.  I am not going to put anyone out of business.  but this place?  I hate it. Wish it would close."}
{"text":"I am picky as hell and when I find a place I like, I tend to order the same thing over and over - which makes me not such a great reviewer.  At this place I tend to always get steamed chicken and vegetables, or steamed tofu and vegetables, white sauce on the side.  The food is always steamed just right and keeping the sauce on the side eliminates any \"typical greasy chinese food\" quality.  Plenty of food, nicely done.  Their hot and sour soup is good but I wish it didn't contain pork.  But most places do.  The reason I need to review this place is because they have got the best steamed vegetables dumplings you will find anywhere in America - and I am writing this from CALIFORNIA where I am surrounded by Asians so I should know!!!  OK, maybe I am not a dumpling expert.  But theirs are damn tasty and I wish I could find something like them out here.  Every time I go home, I need to get pho at LuLus and dumplings at Silk Pagoda.  They are AWESOME.  I wish I could have a truckload shipped to me."}
{"text":"Year in and year out, this is the best asian food restaurant in Pittsburgh.  It's not fancy -- the decor is a bit tired and dusty -- and the food is dressed and presented with bells and whistles, but it's damn good food at a very fair price.    The food is fresh, done well and flavorful.    Another diner noted that there never seems to be more than two or three other tables of diners in the restaurant.  That's true, but there's a steady flow of carry-out and delivery food.    And, for dessert, hop next to the ice cream shop!"}
{"text":"I guess I'd rate Silk Pagoda 3 1/2 stars.  I hadn't eaten here in awhile so when I came home from Dallas last week, Rick and I ended up ordering delivery.  Feeling pretty hungry after my homecoming, I was a little adventurous in ordering Seven Stars Around the Moon.  Gotta love poetic food names at Chinese places.  That's beef, scallops, chicken sauteed and Chinese vegetables surrounded by shrimp.  Yummy!  As always, Silk Pagoda isn't the flashiest, but it fills the bill."}
{"text":"Ordered from Silk Pagoda using GrubHub since we were unable to sneak away from the office... WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!  Not only did the order take forever, but most of the items were incorrect.  We had to call to get the order rectified... and when  we did, they still did not get it right and it took forever.    The food was completely disappointing and the service was even more awful since they did not even seem the slightest bit apologetic about the mishap.    If you want good chinese food delivery, there are better options."}
{"text":"Their food continues to disappoint. I'm never sure what I'm getting because I never get what I order - it's always a mystery meal here. Last time, and probably my last time eating here, I got chow mein but it came in 2 different containers, was soupy and full of celery, and... there were no noodles.   And now that it's winter, it's extremely cold inside. And dark. Also they have a $10 minumim on cards"}
{"text":"I ordered lunch delivered to our business and it seemed to arrived almost as I was hanging up the phone.  The chicken broccoli was hot and the brown rice was really good too.  I am watching what I eat lately so I ordered with specific instructions about how much sauce etc.  And they did it perfectly.  Just enough to give everything great taste and keep me on my diet as well.  And the price was low enough in keeping with this economy we have these days. I plan on ordering again and again."}
{"text":"Love this place for Chinese! We've ordered from them a few times and the general tso is excellent... not a big fan of the wonton soup - tasted off, somewhat greasy and the wontons in hot oil - I have no clue what that was but it certainly wasn't edible."}
{"text":"I've had General Tso. Mehh... I've experienced so much better."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of Silk Pagoda. Quality of the ingredients seemed to be pretty high compared to other Chinese joints in the city. General Tso's was nice and crispy, without too much gristle / fat on the chicken (hey, it's a Chinese restaraunt -- what do you expect?). Sauce had a nice tangy flavor, not too syrupy or sweet. My friend ordered the sesame sliced chicken, which had a really great creamy, nutty, savory sauce.   Like someone else said, sometimes you just need greasy Chinese. The next time I do, I'll be heading to Silk Pagoda."}
{"text":"Sometimes you're just in the mood for greasy chinese, and this place delivers. Everything is flavorful and it tastes like it was freshly made. It's much better than HowLee or Lulu's.   They deliver to a pretty good radius too - it's two and a half miles from there to my apartment."}
