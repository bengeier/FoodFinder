{"text":"Showmars is great for breakfast and lunch.  This location does have the preferred combos of grits...hash browns..eggs...and the meats of choice.  Everything is prepared well.  Seating is never an issue...and i can get in and out in 30 mins.  The restaurant can get busy at times...and timing may halp.  With the various locations...they are pretty much the same on service.  I have to admit....coffee is hottest at other locations than here on 3rd.  But overall....you cannot beat the convenience!"}
{"text":"Ate here two years ago and we simply had to go back there for breakfast again. Unfortunately it didn't stand up to our foodie memory. 

Coffee was weak and the waffle was nasty. Seems like they over sprayed or over oiled the waffle iron and it soaked into the waffle. White sausage gravy wasn't good at all. Perhaps we should have stuck with Greek inspired good. 

The table top was dirty and sticky. Wonder if it was ever wiped down or washed. Yuck!!  

Not sure we'll return."}
{"text":"Something for everyone. All food is good quality. Greek choices but the fish is some of the best in Charlotte. Very fast friendly table service. They have Cheerwine!"}
{"text":"Showmars on 3rd delivers solid food, not great but they do a pretty decent job on meat and 2 veggies and the fish or chicken pita's are definitely worth a try......and on your 'cheat' days enjoy a milkshake if you dare:-)"}
{"text":"So much for me not reviewing chains, but I felt a little shout-out to this Shomar's was in order.  I'll note from the outset that I have ordered the same thing every time I've been here, so the scope of my review is slightly limited.

I have worked near this place for over 2 1/2 years but always thought it looked a little dodgy and never went in. Decided to give this place a shot the other day. Turns out, it is quite nice inside although it has a slightly 80s feel to it.  I've only gotten take-out at this location, but it was pretty fast both times.  I ordered the grilled chicken pita with a side of green beans.  Both were delicious--so much so, that I went back the next day and ordered the same thing.  The pita is a little soggy (at least, it is when you get it to-go), but the chicken is nicely grilled and the tzatziki sauce is also tasty.  And while green beans sound super-boring, they must jazz it up with some spices because they were quite delicious.  

If I ever venture off this recipe for success, I'll update accordingly."}
{"text":"The reason I like Showmars is that you pretty much always know what you're going to get...and that is good home cooked food, and quickly. No different here at this location. I've read some recently negative reviews for this location....but I had a really good experience.

First off, this place gets VERY busy before most businesses starting work time....lots of banking folks sitting around me. I grabbed a seat at the counter to watch the chaos in the Kitchen, and to watch the ONE waitress bust her tail in order to make her customers happy. I also find it amazing how very hard Latino cooks work back in the kitchen, and how quickly they can switch from getting their orders in English yet speak Spanish back there among each other. Their head cook was about as hard working an Expeditor as I've seen, repeating every order and making sure his line cooks get it done right.

My little blonde waitress was filling in for someone who apparently called in sick, and she was uber busy yet kept me happy with coffee and getting my order in and to me very quickly (like 5 minutes). 

So I'd say the STAFF here easily gets 5 STARS. Very hard working and efficient.

Now that I've painted the picture on how this place operates, let me tell you about my Greek Omelet. I got it with Gyro meat and grilled onions, and it was very good! Hash browns and English Muffin were acceptable and average. But the Greek Omelet was filled with tomatoes, feta cheese, gyro meat, grilled onions and some Greek spices. Not overcooked and quite tasty overall. Good size too.

I got about the most expensive thing on the menu and had a coffee and it came out to just over $10. They have MANY breakfast items that hover around $5 if you didn't want to get one of their \"signature\" dishes.

So if you're Uptown and want a good, home cooked meal, come to Showmars....just don't expect Dean and Deluca quality (nor their prices)."}
{"text":"I was with a group of 4 and we ended up at this location right before closing. The staff was very nice even though we showed up about 10 minutes before closing. We were with a lady who lived in Charlotte for a long time. She insisted we must have the sweet tea...makes sense because sweet tea in the real South is what I call diabetic coma sweet and just how I like it. The sweet tea did NOT disappoint...matter if fact I drank ALOT of it. We joked with the lady that she should just leave the pitcher. Lol. She thought we were crazy...we were...crazy for sweet tea 
For my actual food I had the original pita burger...a burger served in a pita with some kind of greekish sauce (I think). What ever kind of sauce it was it was good. The fries that came with it were just basic and seasoned with salt. Maybe seasoning salt would add a little flair and taste. The onion rings were cheap and just okay. To me they taste as if they didn't have any seasoning. 

Overall we received exceptional service, especially since we came before closing, good food at a great price, and awesome sweet tea!"}
{"text":"Good food, but poor service at this particular location. I've gone here for lunch on several occasions over the past few weeks and have encountered multiple problems from the same lunchtime staff, both in terms of service and attitude. A shame. I'll continue to frequent other locations, just not this particular one."}
{"text":"We in the center city, there are not a lot of places to get a full breakfast.........now focus on that word \"full\" because this place will definitely make you F U L L.

So after a night at a fund raiser in the city, I was feeling a bit dull and needed some ol' school breakfast to right my ship...so-to-speak.  Note:  this location only serves breakfast M-F.

This Showmars serves breakfast until 11am and is only a short walk from my place.  I headed down the street and was there in no time.  At 10:30am the place was very quiet as I assume the breakfast crowd had come and gone and the lunch crowd wasn't quiet there.

They have plenty of seating...lots of booths if you like that sort of thing and a small counter to the right when you walk in.

I decided to sit at the counter and was served coffee and water quickly.  The breakfast menu is extensive, albeit simple in offerings.

I ordered 2 eggs scrambled, country ham, hash browns and wheat toast.  The food came out quickly and was hot.  The most interesting thing was the size of the food and plates.........they were H U G E!

I mean it was a lot of food....for the money, this is a place you could get this at 11am and probably not have to eat again for the rest of the day due to calorie intake.  Tons of eggs and hash browns on one plate and country ham on the other.....yes...just the country ham on this other plate.

I couldn't eat it all.  Coffee was filled in a timely manner and the staff friendly and attentive.

All for less than $10....and good deal...not very healthy eating, but good nonetheless."}
{"text":"This place has gone to hell in a hand basket since Peter left.  Customer service is gone.  I ordered a Greek omelette and grits.  Who would have thought they would put the grits on the plate not a bowl with the omelette.  The grits was cool not hot. The best things about my breakfast was my wholewheat toast.  The blonde waitress was more interested in talking to her regulars.  The only time she came to see if I was OK was when she cleaned the table by me.  Never again.  I'll wait for McDonald's to open next time I want breakfast."}
{"text":"Might not be the easiest location to visit or see, but it's a good option because of the people that work here.  Tucked away across a parking lot and underneath an overhand is this Showmars location, but there are a lot of regulars that frequent this place.  The servers and folks running the register are super nice and they recognize you, call you by name, and ask how your work day is going.

I take my lunch around 1pm so WAY after the lunch rush, but I can imagine this place being super busy.  There are a lot of tables and booths to sit at and the food comes out fast - with daily specials.

Super affordable and predictable, you can have you food in front of you pretty quickly - especially if you are trying to do a quick lunch.

Now, this place is pretty practical if you work Uptown and can walk here for lunch.  Probably not a place to drive to since you would have to pay for parking somewhere... even if you park on the street at a metered spot."}
{"text":"Nice people, busy busy busy place, but always great service, fast kitchen.

The kitchen is super fast for carryout."}
{"text":"Lumberjack style breakfast :p

We'd get the french toast, sausage, egg and cheese on an english muffin, eggs, fried egg sandwich for breakfast often.

A little greasy but such comfort food."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came in for breakfast. Amazing deal, great service, and a killer baklava!!!! I highly recommend to anyone in the area as we made the trip from exit 25....we heard good things! This will certainly be our mom n pop breakfast from here on out!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place gets a 5 star is because the of the burgers. They are really yummy like having a burger at your buddies bbq party. As for the rest of the food. Its terrible. The fries are frozen even though the seem to want to brag about the fact that the burger meat is never frozen. Then why not do the same with your fries. Anyway if you go here only order burger."}
{"text":"Cindy mans the register and makes u feel welcome and at home...the fish sandwich is fantabulous and a must have. I call order my breakfast and for 3 bucks I have my breakfast to go. Gotta luv it!!"}
{"text":"Change management and has gone down hill. It's slow, portions are smaller and the staff is terrible. They also raises the prices. I would have been happy to pay the new prices to the previous management but not fit what you get now.

Missed opportunity."}
{"text":"Good gone Bad.

This showmars used to be awesome.  I would have given it 5 stars.  Unfortunately
this Showmars is under new management and it sucks!  They are extremely slow and have messed up my to go orders on multiple occasions.  Also, the portions are not as big.  I think I'll be going to a different Showmars.  Bring the old crew back!"}
