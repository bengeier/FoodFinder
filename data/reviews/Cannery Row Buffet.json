{"text":"My partner and I retired and bought a house in Las Vegas in April, 2010.  At that time we tried out yours and the Aliante Stations buffets and yours was, hands down, the best.  We visited the Cannery several times a month for dinner and a couple times for lunch.  We have always brought our out of town guests there for gaming and food.  The quality of your food has steadily declined since we started coming to what is now inedible.  The prime rib is now a low quality, tough,  underdone steamship round; the tempura shrimp is 'popcorn shrimp' , a dried out bland product that bears no resemblance whatsoever to the shellfish; the seafood fra diavolo is now skimpily scattered atop an overdone spaghetti and your caesar salad is overdressed and limp.  Without exception the other options available appeared to have been held on the steam table until past their prime.  In fairness, I didn't try the pizza.  I don't go to casino buffets for pizza.  Incredibly, while you've lowered quality you've discontinued the bounce-back BOGO that we've enjoyed since arriving here.  Regardless, the meal we had this evening, November 11 at 4:30pm was not worth half of what we paid.  Be assured that the next time we go out to a casino or entertain out  of town guests we will be giving the Aliante Station another try.  A pity, really."}
{"text":"I only go here if i have coupons. Which makes it roughly 4-8 dollars a person (their prices have been changing) . This buffet has a great salad and fruit bar which is worth if to me. The dishes are all okay and worth it if you have a coupon.  Dessert bar is neat. I always enjoy the cookies and chocolate pie. Main dishes at this buffet arnt my thing so i stick to salad, cottage cheese, and the fruit.  I would go again but not pay full price."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here before a movie since it was close.  They were still only serving champagne brunch.  For a buffet, I definitely expected more.  There was not much of a selection.  The food was bland.  It was not worth what we paid.  We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Even for the price I paid, which was $5, this place is still not worth eating at. It was like they unpackaged a crap load of frozen food and dumped it in warming trays. Don't eat here. Go eat Del Taco instead."}
{"text":"Cannery Row buffet on Boulder is one of those hapless  buffets Vegas is famous for these days. If U r on a tight budget n r not very picky of what goes in your mouth. U might consider of giving this place a chance! I hate to admit it! Some of their dishes r quite sensational. But that is just my opinion!"}
{"text":"Don't eat hear. Just had prime rib and shrimp day . Then went to have some desert and there was a cockroach running around the pies so gross!! Told the manager and she said that they spread and they are coming out of their hiding place . I Will Never Go Back !!!!!! Eat at your own risk !!!!"}
{"text":"On a summer trip to Vegas with my parents, they decided to eat at this buffet since it was at the casino that we were staying at. The price is very cheap but the food is terrible. Most of the food was bland and mediocre and the selection was small. The only thing I liked about this buffet were the cheesecake. I had the most stomachache of my life after eating at this place. I would recommend a different buffet beside this place. I am sure there are many other buffets in Vegas that are better and are about the same price as this one."}
{"text":"Not a lot of options as far as food. On top of that you can tell the food has been sitting there for hours, yuck! I'd enjoy my McDonalds meal better then this joint. Service is also lacking. Where the heck is management cause you've got workers just standing and chit chatting!"}
{"text":"I love it here, the food is always fresh and tastes good its not bland at all. My favorite thing to eat is the pozole (not bad for not being home made) the only thing that's a bit inconvenient is that you only get a discount on 2 people with the players card and that they have no special kids pricing so I paid the same price for my 2 year old as I paid for myself. The waiters are always nice and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"I stayed here at the cannery and was hesitant about eating at the buffet, after reading all the reviews. We ate here yesterday, Saturday theme was Down South Cajun, I had a players card so for 2 people it was $30 for dinner. They also gave us a free bottle of wine with your choice of Chardonnay or Merlot. I was pretty surprised and went on to the food.... Jambalaya and seafood pot was good, nice and spicy clears your nasal passage . The brisket was yummy, nicely seasoned didn't need au jous. Falls apart and wasn't dry. We also had salmon, fried clams, and a whole bunch of italian pastas and chicken parm. Didn't care too much for the Mexican or Asian food, they looked dry like its been sitting for a while.       Dessert was yummy in the tummy I recommend the chocolate cake and strawberry cheesecake.  We had seconds, that's how good it was and all we had space for. Service was good,  our waitress was very attentive..kept the drinks coming and took the plates as soon as we were done      Definitely will come back here again when I visit."}
{"text":"This buffet suxs .the dinner buffet the food was very dry if not dry burnt. .it had no flavor or no good variety. To pay 10.99 a person was a joke. I would of payed 5 bucks a person if that....it's my last time I'm going there for the buffet.."}
{"text":"This place is a ways from all the lights and glitz of the strip but the buffet is not bad at all. It's actually pretty good. I've been here about three times before over the last couple years. It's no Wynn but nothing is. I'll definitely be back though. If it's not because of the food. It's because my aunt lives literally across the street from the casino and my cousins play there all the time. LOL"}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Food was mediocre, as in most buffets in Vegas. I came on a Friday night and all the food had been prepared hours before. The American section was all over salted. The Cannery Buffet on the North West side of town is the bomb. If I had a choice between eating here or Golden Corral, I'd choose Golden Corral. Food is better quality there. I live in Vegas and have eaten at lots of buffets. This one is better than most, but has a very limited selection. I can't even think of the best food on the menu because even the dessert bar was not that great."}
{"text":"Not bad, especially when there's a promo going on (lots of 2 for 1 deals). Good salad bar, they also have sushi and other Asian food. Prime rib was okay, as was the pasta (they have a person making pasta dishes to order). Also enjoyed the dessert bar. Staff is attentive and prompt at refilling drinks and taking plates away."}
{"text":"I went to the buffet when it first opened and was very disappointed. So after a few years now of hearing that the buffet has changed, I decided to give it another try. One reason is that they had a weekend special where the buffet was only $7.00 for Can Club Card holders. So, was the buffet worth $7.00? Yes it was. Was it worth the normally $20.00 they charge for it? Oh no it was not. Some of the food was OK. Most of the food was very low in quality.  I was also a bit confused by the station names. There was the Mexican food station which spilled over to the Italian food station which had almost overtaken the American Food station. I did like the spring rolls and potato soup a lot. The pizza was ok as well as the Orange Chicken. The roast beef though, argh! The beef came out looking like it was 25 lbs of meat. It took a long time to cook and thus it was so dry. Almost no pink in the center at all.  Our server was great though. That it why the buffet gets two stars and not just one. Keep up the great service and bring up the quality of the food and I just might go back in the future. But for now, I will just stay away."}
{"text":"Most of the people on this page are over exaggerators. The food here is good. It may not be the best, but it is close to home and filled me up just right. The ham they have out is extremely delicious. The spaghetti and meatballs is great too. The pizza was great as well. It's all affordable. It may be a small food selection but it has huge capacity in seating and it's very comfy. Also, the service is very friendly. Wouldn't mind eating here again."}
{"text":"So the Mrs and I wanted to try a new buffet because we always like to investigate new places for when our family and friends comes to visit. Because let's face it, most tourists think dining in Vegas revolves around buffets!  I never really read too much into other people's reviews but I'm really shocked by all the negative reviews!  That being said I have noticed there have been a lot of  postings and advertisements about this being the NEW cannery buffet so maybe it is dramatically different NOW as of November 2!?  I am a huge fan of the \"quality over quantity\" campaign when it comes to buffets, I don't need it to be the size of a football field to be considered a \"GOOD\" buffet, for me I want the offerings to be something unique or if it's the same ol' thing I want the quality and flavor to be good.  Cannery Row pulled this off for me!!!  This is not the Rio Carnival Buffet where you can get lost in the shear size of the buffet, but there are plenty of stations with a large variety of food and it won't break the bank, a mere $5.99 for lunch!  It seems to be  reasonably sized to where the product seems to be kept fresh.  We went at an odd time, about 3pm, so it was impressive that the food was maintained so well, we also received a dollar off for dining between 2-4 (something we didn't plan but it's good to know for the future).  The buffet is completely self serve so you get your own drinks, I like that!  I hate waiting around to order another drink or wait for coffee so kudos to them for doing that!   They also had some of the best desserts I've had on any buffet.  The cookies were fantastic and were only a close second place to the donuts at Boulder Station's Feast Buffet when it comes to tasty treats!  We will go back in the future for the Dinner or Breakfast buffet but as for the LUNCH buffet they won me over and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I really like the Cannery Casino.  On 3/2/2014 @ 4pm I went to the Cannery Buffet on a 2 for 1 coupon. I live in Las Vegas and frequent our dining establishments on an almost daily basis and the Cannery Buffet is the worst Buffet I have ever visited. EVERY dish was COLD! No matter which area of the buffet I sampled, the food was cold. It was like they had a power outage and the warming tables were ALL inoperative.  I hope Cannery Buffet monitors social media, particularly Yelp, and corrects this situation. As noted in another review the buffet prices are higher than several other casinos. The Cannery Casino is enjoyable however, if they force gamblers to go outside the casino for an edible meal, they will lose a lot of gamblers."}
{"text":"This at one time above average Casino Continues it's Downward Slide. From Dried Out Food, to unknown bits stewing all day without even a stir, to indifferent service and dowright Rude Management, just skip this place for the half dozen places within a block. I would also suggest playing at a less smokey place (somtimes the Cheap Cigar Smoke and poor filtration system will make you strip down in thhe Garage to wash you clothers and not stink up your house) and their weekend night crowd can quickly make you feel unsecure and heading for the exits. Talk about Winning at this Casino? I've foud out they generally take in over $ 100 per 30 minutes while playing just a little more than minimum. Play the Strip - the Cannery is a place for Lazy Locals that would rather lose their money with no real comps as opposed to driving another 10  Minutes. My neighbors that drive to the MGM may lose, however they get amazing Comps  (Concerts-Meals-Rooms). For the same or less Number of points you can be a Diamond Member at Harrah's and get free rooms across the country, invitations, gaming junkets, etc. ."}
{"text":"This food was disgusting the only thing that was somewhat good was the Orange chicken on the Chinese bar....I can get better Orange chicken at panda express but literally everything else I ate was gross I was throwing whole plates away I went up to the American bar and asked the guy what a item was..he said I honestly don't know this item did not have a sign above it the oxtail soup was the worst thing I had in life and I love oxtails traditionally then at the end of my meal I went to the desert bar looked at a item that looked like a smore cheesecake bite asked the guy what it was he said the exact same thing the guy at the American bar said honestly I don't know not to mention  I waited about 15 min for my first drink terrible food terrible service. You couldn't pay me to eat there again."}
{"text":"My family and I went to the Cannery Buffet for Thanksgiving, the food there was so tasty. We had a party of 20 and everyone enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"I took my mom to the cannery for her birthday she enjoyed the food selection.  Dessert was excellent ."}
{"text":"The WORST...GO TO SAM'S TOWN way way way BETTER CASINO AND WAY WAY BETTER BUFFET(you will be glad u did)...nice selection good food and THE SAME PRICE FOR WAY MORE...who ever designed that buffet at the Cannery and thought hey \"build it they will come\"..WAS SADLY MISTAKEN..same being said with the sports book.. worst designed sports book in town NEEDS WAY MORE TVS... The buffet food is cheap, COLD and tasteless..and the casino has some of the TIGHTEST machines around....it's never busy(like a ghost town on Friday nights).. i\"m guessing for that reason..SAM'S TOWN IS ALWAYS BUSY WITH A MUCH MUCH MUCHHHHHHHHHH BETTER CHANCE AT WINNING!!!!!...so whether you walk or drive if your looking for a good buffet TRUST ME OUT OF THE TWO SAM'S TOWN IS A FAR BETTER CHOICE...pretty sad when there own employees agree and I quote     \"DON'T GAMBLE HERE PEOPLE NEVER WIN..(laughing) GO TO SAM'S TOWN YOU DO MORE BETTER\"..I like honest people :)"}
{"text":"The buffet here is so dry, they charge you so expensive it's not even worth it. Better off going to McDonald's or something. Plus their dessert with whip cream tastes like old milk, so if you want to be constantly in the bathroom. Don't try it, I really hope they will improve their buffet here."}
{"text":"Complete garbage. This had to be the worst waste of money I have ever spent. Without the card it was 30 dollars for me and my wife, and lets put it this way I had better food when I was at bootcamp and I eat ANYTHING. The selection was more sparse then the desert, and what was there was either bland, cooked wrong, had been sitting under the lamps for way to long, or all of the above. The macaroni and cheese was worse then a T.V. dinner. I could have made better taquitos if I had microwaved some I bought from the store. But yet the greatest part is some how they managed to ruin what seems like a pretty simple dessert bar, I would have gladly taken a rock covered with shredded paper over their supposed strawberry cheese cake which seemed to be slathered with red jello instead of an actual drizzle. Besides the food the only other things I have to even remotely complain about is that it wasn't very well ventilated so the smoke smell lingered in from the casino which makes my pregnant wife a little nauseous, and that they could up date there decor it's just a little older and has some wear. Other then that the staff was definitely their best asset friendly, conscious of our existence, and removed plates before we could get back to the table. Now all they have to do is work on getting food that is edible. For all intensive purposes I would recommend going to the Aliante just 5 minutes away same price SOOOOO much better"}
{"text":"best brunch buffet.all fresh, delicious .try their fresh omelet station and italian foods..yum yum .best price and great customer service.Got a glass of champagne too."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting and ridiculously overpriced. Horrible, very small selection. Had a bad stomach ache after eating here. However, the server was very friendly and attentive. Nonetheless, never again."}
{"text":"Me and my family have eaten here several times. They have food from different countries.  The price is very good for all you can eat. It is not fine dining it is buffet style. The place is clean and the staff do their job.  I have seen several reviews that say the food is not at the right temperature and that is simply not the case the food is always prepared as it should be."}
{"text":"Stopped going here earlier this year, but decided to try Thanksgiving buffet. It was a mistake. They couldn't find a rare piece of Prime, it was all medium well to well done ruining what may have been a good piece of meat. I tried a turkey leg that must have been deep fried as it was rock hard and only because I have my teeth could I rip a piece off the bone and then it was not chewable. They have also started watering down the orange juice."}
{"text":"We always get free buffet coupons here. The salad bar is great. The entrees are ok. You get lucky sometimes when they have good seafood dishes. Good selection of desserts. It's an ok place and if you eat for free its even better."}
{"text":"The Cannery Row Buffet could be a really great buffet, but for some reason it is not. I used to dine here a lot several years ago when I lived in Las Vegas for awhile.  I went back this past week while I was visiting Las Vegas, and nothing has changed, at least not for the better.  I took my husband with me because I had a BOGO deal.  We went for dinner because I always feel there's a better selection of food at any buffet for dinner. While there are TONS of options, none of them taste all that great, but on the flip side I guess you get what you pay for these days.  Dinner is $13.99 p/p without a Cannery loyalty card, with the card the price drops to $11.99 p/p, so with a BOGO that averaged to just about $6 p/p which is all it's really worth.   There were options that day like stuffed bell peppers, spaghetti and meatballs, ribs, collard greens, okra, baked chicken, fried chicken, pizza, taquitos (dry and hard), fried rice, sweet & sour chicken, chow mein, egg rolls, pozole, Italian Wedding Soup, and lots of other options, but nothing cooked with \"heart.\"  It feels, looks, tastes like institutional food.   I just don't get it. Maybe they don't use enough seasoning, maybe the food is good too long, maybe they need people who ENJOY cooking for their livelihood. Whatever it is they are lacking they should try to remedy the problem, then maybe they'd be so busy they wouldn't know what to do with all that extra income from the buffet."}
{"text":"Came here on my day off.  Traveled a far ways.  Food was ok.  Server was nice. But let me tell you about the Cashiers and Hostess. OMG If I treated a guest at the buffet I work at like we were treated by these two women, I wouldn't have a job to go to. The Cashier ignored us (not to mention many people behind us as well) too busy flirting with Hispanic man.  Hostess was so rude, she just threw our receipt on the table. This  buffet wasn't busy and there is no reason for rudeness. Not ever.  I work with locals as well but I would never treat anyone the way we were treated."}
{"text":"Went to this buffet at 11am in the morning on a Wednesday. The service was excellent the food was fresh. The representatives working there were very nice. Its a cool place to have lunch. I would recommend this place for someone who likes a variety of different things. If you are in the area and want a decent lunch, this is a good place to go if you live nearby."}
{"text":"12.99 plus tax with player card for dinner buffet. The selections were limited. They had Mexican and a little bit of Chinese and Japanese.    The prime rib was probably the best thing Although it was a bit tough. It was flavorful.   The vanilla cake with chocolate topping was pretty good."}
{"text":"The buffet is decent. It's nothing spectacular. It's kind of expensive for what they offer; which isn't much. The thing that get's me is they will charge full price for any child over 3 years old. I was just charged $10.99 for my 5 yr old daughter that had 1 piece of pizza, 5 chunks of watermelon, and a chocolate milk."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for champagne brunch. Although none of my family members are drinkers, I felt the brunch is worth the price since it was only $12.99. They had lamb, ham, turkey at the carving station. There were even serving lox!  Love those smoked salmons, so I stocked up on them. Our sever was friendly but wish he had check on our table more frequently. Because he didn't come back to our table, we were stuck with a pile of used dishes. Our drinks were not refilled. They have free wifi so I was very happy! Unfortunately, no AT&T cell signal. The only thing is if you need to use the restroom, you have to leave the restaurant and use the one on the casino floor. Skip those pricey buffets on the strip, and come here. You pay less and get a decent food."}
{"text":"Nice employees, Salad Bar is good Deserts are ok but damn for almost $12.00 I could have had a better meal at Denny's which is where I will go next time I think I want to eat here."}
{"text":"The line moved very slowly considering it was not very long.  The cashier was not particularly friendly, she kept looking around the room and ignoring the customer in front of her.  The server was friendly and attentive. The ice tea was terrible, it had a funny taste.  The salads were pretty good.  The serving stations were grouped by cuisine; most dishes were only tolerable.  The broccoli chicken in particular was too tough.  The ice cream was grainy, not smooth; there was no rich, creamy taste. There were no cookies on the dessert bar. The pie slices were stiff, the filling was unremarkable  If you have a two for one coupon then it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner Buffett on a Sunday evening. Was seated promptly and headed to the chow line. There was no salad bar which I found odd. Just different kind of salads,pasta salad,pea salad, broccoli salad, macaroni salad and the likes. Decided to start with Ham an barley soup , which was very delicious. Never had this before but the ham paired great with the barley and the broth was like a heavenly gravy. Very very good. I had two bowls.   Dinner entrees were a hit and miss deal. Buffet kind of reminded like a low key Golden Corral. But what do you expect for $11.99 with a Players Club Card. Mexican station had awesome Pork Carnitas. Very flavorful, moist and had a little spice to them, very good. Beef and broccoli had good flavor to it. Although the beef had a odd texture to it. Didn't eat much of the beef , but the broccoli and other veggies in it were very tasty. Italian station had very good stuffed manicotti. They had a carving station of ham and roast beef. Didn't have any of that tho. Didn't like the steak tips with mushrooms, as steak was tuff and lacked flavor. I think they forgot to salt the meat before cooking. Bad bad move ! Always salt beef before cooking.  Who's with me ?   Deserts were good. Who can't like deserts ? All in all a good deal for $11.99. I would be go back again definitely!"}
{"text":"they made a complete turnaround. Their food is great now. They have so much to choose from and it is at great temps. They make very good chipped beef on the bruch would recommend now"}
{"text":"Remember folks this is a buffet and you pick what you want to eat.  I go healthy and throw in a few ribs and chicken along the way.  There is a decent variety to choose from.  The buffet here is better than Santa Fe station when it comes to MY SOFT SPOT ... dessert!"}
{"text":"What a disappointing experience! This was my first time coming here and for sure my last one. The selections are very limited for the price and they are not really well stocked with fresh items. None of the food here was something I would want to eat again and the dessert selections are just cookies and ice cream pretty much."}
{"text":"Yes this dump is close for good goodbye lol lol lol......"}
{"text":"This was a very mediocre buffet. It got the job done but if you're looking for good food it's definitely not the place. It was clean and such, but the salad was old and too soaked with dressing, and even a dessert fiend such as myself was disappointed with the desserts- they seemed like they were straight out of the box. The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because my boyfriend thought the meat slabs were pretty decent."}
{"text":"My family went out a couple weeks ago on a Sunday $7.00 special.   Taking the money aside, it is a small buffet with a few interesting pieces. The Atlantic Salmon was pretty decent. The desserts are probably the best feature of the buffet.  The omelet station is a bit... interesting? The omelet station shares a space with the Mexican section. I asked for cilantro in the omelet, which is the FIRST thing next to the omelet czar. She tells me that \"too many people are allergic to cilantro, so we cannot do that. The pans are not cleaned out in between omelets.\"  My parents are vegetarians that eat eggs. My mom was standing next to me, so i inquired about how ham, bacon & sausage can make it on omelets. What if someone wants a vegetarian omelet? She says \"That's different. No one will get sick from eating meat.\" I honestly felt like walking away from the stupid omelet while the lady reams me up one side and down the other over how ham and bacon in an omelet is much different than cilantro. She would have gotten a $2.00 tip from me. I'm certain it was worth it for her to chew me out than give me 2¢ worth of cilantro.  For the dessert, they had one of my favorites, lemon meringue pie. However, they were only serving it in Sugar-Free. My family does not do aspartame. I asked if they have regular lemon meringue, the employee tells me it is all the same and to just take that. They will put out the sugared version later.   So, I suppose Jews & Muslims who do not eat pork will not get offended by eating an omelet from someone just before them that ordered a ham & bacon omelet? But if I ask for cilantro on top of my omelet, the CDC will come in and quarantine the whole place for allergies?   So, we have people that believe sugared desserts and sugar free are essentially the same, and an omelet person who believes it is ok to make a bacon & ham omelet, not wash the pan, and ask the Jewish man what omelet they would like... and argue loud enough over cilantro to have the YelpWorld wonder WTF.  If it was priced at more than $7.00 for the buffet, I'd have been offended. I suppose if you just want some cheap eats and have some dessert afterwards, it ends up being cheaper than IHOP. However, there are hundreds of better places to go get breakfast."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and it was \"OK\". Price is around $10 but for the same price I'd rather go to Boulder or Sunset Station. We went here because we had watched a movie and decided to have lunch here afterwards. There's really not much to choose from. Actual dishes where flavorless. This won't be my first choice buffet and probably won't come here again for lunch. Maybe dinner is different."}
{"text":"This buffet is amazing. I've been coming here for 6 years now and it gets better each year. The salad bar has all the best ingredients for a serious salad. (Spinach, cheese, red onions, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, olives, eggs, mushrooms etc.) The baked cod, breaded clams and Clam chowder on Fridays - Winning! Also the breaded Pork chops are delicious. And for the grand finale', my family and friends rave over the OUT OF THIS WORLD - BREAD PUDDING w/ whisky sauce. There is nothing like it on earth! All this and 5-star service is why my family and friends have been coming here for 6 years. Lena, Gabby and superstar Debra makes each visit like visiting family. The Hosts are just wonderful. Holly knows what she is doing here. Kudos to management!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch with champagne is lit! Get yourself the Cannery club card and it gives you a discount price. There's a variety of food, but you do pay what you get (11.00 buck buffet ?) so the salad bar is fresh but may wanna grab the salt . The omelet line isn't that long, everyone seems to like it. Coupons are always getting mailed if you have the C card !"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim.... Absolutely our first and last visit to this place. First off, their food selection is very minimal and the food is super bland. I feel like we just got ripped off. If I only knew, I wouldn't pay 44 dollars for two adults and a child. It's not worth it at all. Horrible horrible food. Not happy at all. We are still nice to leave a tip on the table though."}
{"text":"Well, this gets average rating at best.  Don't get it when they put forth the effort and fail so short.  Is it that much harder to make it better?   Back to square one for them.  Hopefully with the recent sale in the works for the Cannery, it will get better."}
{"text":"I've been eating it Cannery Row Buffet about once a month for several years now I've been to all the other buffets in Las Vegas and Reno and Wendover Nevada. None of them have the variety and range of quality food that Cannery Row Buffet has. I'm so tired of these weasels that coming on here saying their food was cold that's insane you were sitting around talking and not eating your food it doesn't come out of that place cold and you're supposed to pull from the bottom that's a simple rule at a buffet if you come in there at the end of the service you pull from the bottom. And people that talk about macaroni and cheese oh my God you don't pay $13 to eat macaroni and cheese LOL The Carving stations are excellent people talk about raw food a guy doesn't know what prime rib is if your prime rib is too raw for you then have them put it back on the stove and flip it and they will do that. I'm reading all these other reviews these people just have an axe to grind because they have the finest selection of food and quality of food here I've ever seen in any buffet in Las Vegas.  $2 off with a player's card that's doable usually you can win as much at the slot machines to pay for the meal. And it has the shortest lines of any buffet in Vegas if you've ever been to Circus Circus and waited an hour and a half in line you know what I'm talking about. This Cannery I've been 4th or 5th in line nearly every time I walk up to it. So if you're a local or someone that passes through Vegas a lot like I do it's a much easier in and out with parking and traffic as well."}
{"text":"IF a coupon for 2 free buffets is involved, I give it a 4.  If there's no coupon, then I give this place a 1.   Once in a while, we get a coupon for two free buffets to this place. For free, this place is good. But if anyone paid full price, then I know they're not locals and I feel sorry for them as they make their way to the food.   I rate server service based on how many times they refill my beverage.  Almost every time I've gone they've been pretty decent, so I give them a 4.   For value (fine, I'll base it on if someone actually paid) I give it a 1, because I feel this food is fancy cafeteria food.   For ambience I give it a 2. You can only get so much ambience in a buffet.   For overall experience, I rate it a 2.3.   So check your mailbox and if you get your FREE buffet coupons, then visit and enjoy the free meal.   BONUS: It's  five minutes away from my house.  Three if I hit all the greens and not traffic."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite buffets, alog with east side cannery over on east craig road.  The food is pretty good. Not the best, but good for the price. They always send 2 for one coupons in the mail, so 2 people all you can eat for $7.99, not to bad at all. The staff is friendly, does their job efficiently, with a minimum of hovering over the customers. The atmosphere is roomy seating, and pleasant.  Always lots of customers, yet plenty of space. Lines to get in are rare, and cashier is very quick and efficient. No waiting and waiting to get in. Another thing I like about this place is that the drink stations are accesseable to the customers. You can get youre drinks youre self if you want to, or have a server get them. Most buffets seem to hide the drink stations in a back room, and a server must get them for you. (probably so they have an excuse to expect a tip. If you get youre own food and drinks you dont need to feel guilty about not giving a tip, because the server did not really do anything to deserve or expect a tip.)     This is the place to go, if you enjoy being a cheapskate, yet want some degree of value and quality. If you are into wider selections and more expensive stuff, there is always the downtown casinos, but the prices over there are much higher. (you get what you pay for.)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this buffet for the price.  But I am not a gambler, so  I don't like having to walk through aisles of slot machine patrons smoking and moaning about losing their money before getting to the buffet.  But it's part of their strategy to make you stop and play.  Funny thing is, they're required by law to give back 90 per cent of their net income to winnings. In other words, you lose 10 per cent overall.  But that 10% they make in profit helps pay for an all you can eat buffet that is worth more than you pay for. Check for 2 for 1 coupons in the paper and area circulars.   If you go to dinner, don't go after 6 PM.  It gets super crowded. We went around 5 PM, the parking isn't bad though there is a theater complex and an outdoor concert there on weekends. Ugh, watching a concert in 105 degree heat?  I'll pass.    It was mom's brithday, and  she wanted to play a few penny machines after eating dinner.  Dinner had some awesome prime rib and turkey, as well as whole steamed salmon.  There was a salad bar with good cole slaw and prepared salads as well as a make your own salad. The, dessert bar was the best, with the warm cherry and peach cobblers better than most buffets.There was an American Food section, Mexican, and Chinese.  You get a big slab of prime rib if that's whay you're in the mood for, It was excellent served with horseradish, and several types of vegetables. and loads of sides like rice pilaf, various main entrees such as beef tips over noodles, I liked their herb roasted chicken, and many items such as mac and cheese. Whatever I tried was good.  Lots of seafood could be found with shimp, tilapia, salmon, and cod.  Lot of different chicken dishes, soups, etc.  The service was good, the waiter kept our sodas full.     It's pretty far from the strip, but I like this hotel casino theater concert complex."}
{"text":"The food here was alright.  I mean, it was pretty good for $10.  It wasn't the best, but it definitely wasn't the worst.  I think that, looking at other reviews, we may have come at a good time.  I would eat here again given the choice.  There are definitely worse deals on the planet.  If you're looking for really high quality food, I'd look elsewhere.  The buffet was about what I'd expect.  If you need volume, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I don't mean to be rude, but service here is just appalling. The cashiers and hosts were not so accommodating. I get that some parties are large, but they do not have to talk about the customers right when they walk away to other workers. I don't recommend going here if you want to be treated unfairly."}
{"text":"My parents got the \"2 free buffet\" promo/comp in the mail. So Worse case scenario of this buffet, I won't be back. Yeah,  I will not be returning to this eatery. Food was minimal, not much selection. The hot food wasn't held at proper temperature. The dessert I had, coconut cream pie tasted like egg nog."}
{"text":"When you're in Las Vegas, one of the must things to do is to eat at a buffet.  For my daughter's volleyball tournament, we're staying at the Cannery Hotel and Casino, which like most Las Vegas hotels has their own buffet.  Honestly, the Cannery Row Buffet warrants 2.5 stars.  The Cannery Row Buffet has a lot of potential, but after eating there, it really is untapped.  If you're on a budget and you want to check off eating at a Las Vegas buffet, I would recommend Cannery based solely on how cheap the buffet is.  Make sure to sign up for a Cannery Player's card and you'll save $4 on your buffet.  For a measly $11.99, you'll be able to say you at at a Las Vegas buffet.  The buffet can be easily located by large letters spelling Cannery.  There is plenty of seating and a lot of food choices.  On a Friday night at 5:30pm, it wasn't crowded at all, which became readily apparent after eating here.  Cannery is an example of getting what you paid for.  As I said earlier, this buffet has so much untapped potential.  Management could do so much with this buffet.  I actually felt like the entire buffet and staff were sad.  Presentation of the food made the food look unappealing.  The staff serving the food weren't too enthusiastic.  Our server tried her best and I appreciated her hard work, but that was it.  The food was okay.  Nothing blew me away.  I like their fried chicken, prime rib, egg rolls, and fried wantons.  The dessert bar had a large selection, but the only things that stood out were the cheesecake and cannolis.  If you want to save money and you have to have that Las Vegas buffet, the Cannery Row fits the bill.  For $11.99, you get to eat a lot and still have money left to play the slots.  The only issue is you won't have anything to write home about."}
{"text":"A buffet is always a good option for people who like a vast array of food options.  Since my husband, madre-in-law & I all wanted something different, we decided to head over to the Cannery since its the closest buffet to our house.  Now, I have recently been to Bachannal Buffet in Caesar's, so I knew not to get my hopes up too high for the Cannery Buffet.    The dinner buffet is regularly priced at $14.99 a person.  If you have the Cannery Can-Club card (which is free & you get free $5 slot play when you sign up), the price drops to $10.99.  What I was mostly disappointed with is the fact that it closes at 8:00 p.m.  Really?  8:00 p.m.?  Since when does anything in Las Vegas close at 8:00 p.m.?  I know the older folks frequent these outlying casinos, but come on... they could at least stay open until 9:00 p.m.  The food was average - nothing too exciting.  They have a pasta station, classic American station (although, with only BBQ stuff), a Chinese station & a Mexican station.  There were also assorted desserts.  Like I said - it's pretty average.  But in Vegas, for $10.99 a person, I think it's exactly what we expected."}
{"text":"Can I give this place zero stars?  The only good thing about this buffet is the  two for one coupon you can find in the RJ. Okay service. Food leaves a lot to be desired.  It's either old and dried out, too salty, too mushy, and/or just unappetizing.  This is in a neighborhood with a lot of lower income families.  While the price is right, the food is not.  Value doesn't just mean the price is low.  Value is when you get a quality product for a reasonable price.  This is not a good value.  Management and chef's should reevaluate their offerings and get better food in there."}
{"text":"Got here sat down ordered drinks, waiter came back and there was a hair in my cup. Food selection is alright, minimal fish products. No desert all they had was ice cream and cake. Desert was also out to long so some items became hard. All I wanted was a brownie or something chocolaty. \"Fresh fruit\" was not fresh at all fruit was hard and not sweet. Food layout was strange you have to reach directly over food to get to the choice behind it. Buffet section is a little too close to the main casino, so if you don't smoke I advise you to sit in the back because thats all your going to smell while your eating. Small dining area gets heavy with traffic at times. Overall the food was \"ok\" the only reason why I will give it two stars is because, well it filled me up so I can't complain about that.   Pricing is ridiculous for the quality and service. Approach this place with caution!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before and it was a comp from a family member.  It wasn't great but it wasn't bad by any means.  The line wast too long and the selection of food was decent.  Service was prompt and our drinks were refilled quickly and plates cleared without having to ask.  I see people saying this is one of the worst buffets they've been to, they obviously have been to state line or to Palace Station...   If I had to pay for this buffet I wouldn't be disappointed so making it free only made it much better.  Let's just say if I'm in the area again, I wouldn't hesitate to dine here.  Thanks Cannery for the meal and the service."}
{"text":"This place is just bad!!!! I ate there for the second time today and it was even worse than the first. Their only saving grace is the deserts.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Standard buffet with a really good layout. You don't have to walk a mile from station to station.   There's a:  Dessert station  Salad station American station  Asian station Mexican station Italian station  Beverage station with Pepsi and dole juice   Huge dining area  Great carving station but they had lamb- No beef!? Turkey, ham and chicken.   There's and omelette station as well as eggs Benedict and corn beef hash as well as spam!   Gemma is a great server. Very prompt and always checking in.  Definitely not a bad place to relax and enjoy a reasonably priced and good tasting meal.   If you're in the area, I suggest this place as it looks newer than most of the area and it doesn't seem too busy.   Thanks for feeding me and providing a wide selection of food to satisfy my pallet.  Oh yeah... They also have a champagne brunch... Get your buzz on!   Cheers!"}
{"text":"I used to live in CA so every time I would come to Vegas, a trip to a buffet was necessary. I've been to the buffets at MGM, Planet Hollywood, and the Rio. So I knew what good buffets were.  Recently moved to North Vegas and this buffet is right up the street from me. First time going in, I knew not to have high expectations. Especially since it was priced around $10 with the Can Club Card. However, I had no idea it was going to be this bad. Came for dinner first time and the seating was good. Plenty of tables and booths so no long waiting. That was possibly the highlight of the trip. The food seemed to lack a lot of flavor, spices, and was very dry.  The next two trips, same results. In fact, it seemed like the food had gotten even worse. Went there for breakfast and the food was dry and seemed like it was sitting out for hours. The only thing I like about this place is the self serve ice cream. Although one of their machines was broke but they have another one.  I do not plan on coming here. Even if it is only about $10."}
{"text":"I just wasnt impressed with this buffet. Even though the buffet facility is decorated nicely, the food itself just reminded me of poorly made cafeteria fare. It seemed salty, and not homemade.  Ill try again in the future after they make some changes"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. The selection very poor. Food cold and stale. Worst place I have eaten in Las Vegas and North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Well my wife had won 2 free Buffet tickets about a week ago. So we decided to go today Tuesday for lunch since it's both our day off. We have been to this buffet about 3 other times and we like it the host are always on top of the drinks and the empty plates. The price went up a little but theres always coupons outhere. The food here is good I like that they have different kinds of food they got some seafood,salads,Mexican,Chinese,Italian,American and dessert a little of everything. we haven't had any Dinner here yet but there's always nextime."}
{"text":"We used to come here all the time. But everytime we go back the food gets worse and worse. The food is not the same anymore. It feels like we are eating plastic. The price is very reasonable and customer service is great which we appreciate, but the food is not good anymore."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible, terrible. We ended up eating here because we were all starving. We would have been better off eating pretty much anywhere else (to include dumpster diving at the nearby Chipolte). I had absolutely nothing there that was good/properly cooked/served at an appropriate temperature. The cake was warm, the chicken (of questionable color) was cold and the egg drop soup tasted like they hadn't properly washed whatever was in the soup tureen before it out all the way. One of the people I was with tried to eat the white rice but gave up because it had been cooked so long it reverted to it's natural state (rice shouldn't crunch). The only way I could maybe be convinced to eat here again would be if the casino comped me."}
{"text":"Warning they do last call an hour before scheduled closing in evening.  Sunday champagne brunch they don't refill or freshen the salad bar or other areas of food service. The chefs walk around and can clearly see empty food servers.  ridiculous low to empty levels. I told one of the chefs that they were out of lettuce and three of their containers he saw me walk away so he didn't refill it so I walked around the buffet came back he still didn't make attempt to rectify my request. I saw another chef just walking around I told  him he went around the corner told the first chef and chucked.  This was between 12-1:30 and they still had a line of people paying to come in .  I was forced to ask for the buffet manager it took probably about 10 minutes before she could get to me she came over I explained it to her then she panicked once I showed her my review on Yelp.   Very unprofessional waste of time/ money driving here.  We are locals and we are very experienced at what you should experience at a buffet."}
{"text":"Tried it a few times just in case the first one wasn't the usual experience, but it was...    Very BLAND food, Very LITTLE selection.. They don't keep anyone at the carving station, sometimes you have to wait more than five minutes to get a slice of ham or turkey.  sometimes they only have one meat on the carving station, never more than two.  This is BAD; they need more options. Sometimes  you wait forever for a refill on your drink, even if you ask.  The machines aren't that far away but I was stopped from getting my own refill -- I had waited more than 25 minutes. I let a whole plate of food get cold because I needed a drink first.  I said take this plate please.  This one? Why? she asked. I had to say everything got cold while I was waiting for a drink.   They have mashed potatoes and ONE other vegetable.  SOMETIMES. The rolls keep running out; they have a basket of rolls like you'd have at dinner for four people.   The butter is FROZEN.  You can't put frozen butter on bread or a roll.  The salad bar has more items that the regular food and the deserts are even bigger. They need to double the amount of food for the meal...and give it some flavor.  Considering all of this, it is very overpriced.  It needs to be less than $5 for what they have and the terrible service they provide."}
{"text":"Boulder strip discounted crap would eat if I was broke but that's about it"}
{"text":"Yuck! This is the worst buffet I have ever had! Fortunately I didn't get sick after eating there! All the food was cold,stale and old.Even the desserts were stale and dry."}
{"text":"I was extremely upset when their ice cream machine was broken.  Good thing they had an identical machine next to the first but still I had to walk further to it."}
{"text":"Excellent quality buffet especially for the value.  Selection may not be the largest but it makes up for it in quality especially for what they charge.  The breakfast omelet station is better than most other buffets in town.  The shrimp or chicken pasta station for dinner is equally as good.  Great quality ingredients. The other good parts I like is the prime rib station and the Chinese beef dishes.  For some reason the beef they use in the Chinese stir fry dishes is super tender and keeps me coming back for more.  The service and friendliness of the staff is also better than most other local casinos.  Overall I like it better than Station casino Feast buffets. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not saying you need to not have tastebuds to eat here, but... no, yeah I am.  Over salted. Expensive (comparatively). Lackadaisical service. Poor selection. Food was edible, if barely. If it were cheap, well, I would not have bothered writing a review, but if I can save anyone else it will be worth it. The only reason we stopped in was it was one of two places open while we waited for our movie. Never again. I'll make sure we eat before we get here next time.   Ah well, since it was brunch at least I got Champaign."}
{"text":"Wow. I, uh...hmmm...  I would have thought since there was a decent line to get in that it would have been better.  I live in Vegas and I've seen some buffets in my time. I'd rather not see this one again. The enchiladas were gross with the processed cheese taste. The cheesy bread tasted like grease. Even the ice cream tasted like someone tossed in some Windex. How do you get that wrong? There was a hair in the chopped eggs in my salad.  I do have to say that the hot and sour soup was good as well as the chicken won tons.  If you don't need tasty, quality food, then this is for you. If you're fine with buying generic Kraft Mac & Cheese to save money, then feast upon these dishes."}
{"text":"I always receive coupons to the buffet here and finally decided to try it out since I was in the area. Like most buffets, the cuisine is divided between Asian, Italian, etc. and each section has about 4-5 selections. I can say that probably 1 out of the 5 is a \"safe\" selection. Most of the food choices have been sitting out for a while and doesn't taste fresh (what do you expect, really :P). The quality was not very good but I didn't expect much since I was only paying for 1/3 of the average buffet price on the Strip, hah.   I'd say the \"build-your-own-tacos\" section was probably the saving grace, and I helped myself to many burritos and tacos throughout the meal. Just add some jalapeños and avocado chunks and you can make anything pretty edible, right? The salad bar is decent and also has salmon, which is alright. Also, the service was surprisingly good. Refills were frequent and consistent. My dad asked for chopsticks and the waiter not only pointed us to where it is but brought it over to us.  A few notes: I would go light on the pasta because looks are deceiving. It doesn't taste nearly half as good as it looks. I think for the price and location, it's alright. There's not a lot of other buffets in the area that is worthy of consideration, unless you go all the way up to Green Valley Ranch or Sunset Casino. I have tried much worse buffets in town (think Palms) so I can't complain too much."}
{"text":"I have are at most of the buffets in Vegas and this one was the worst. I was in on a Sunday 2pm ,nothing on the carving station. Breakfast was all dried up,not much to pick from. Stay away"}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple..  Overpriced Poor quality food Very small selection of food, you would think with each section having only 5 items max that it would be made well, but no.  However the desert was fresh and tasty.  I'd give it 1 star but the service was most excellent! Joe was our waiter and he was extremely polite and on point! The MOMENT he noticed our drinks were empty he was there to fill them and when they weren't he still came by. Very impressed with Joe's service!!! Thank You!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of casino buffets.  The Cannery buffet in (NORTH LAS VEGAS) is by far the worst I have ever been to. I have eaten there about 6 times, all comped. Every time the hot food is cold. Gnats flying around the salad bar. Last time (about 2 weeks ago), I had the Thursday Prime Rib. Besides my normal complaints, the prime rib was RAW in the center. I always get my prime rib center cut, I like it to moo when you start cutting into it. It was so raw, this frigging thing got up and started to run.  Considering it was late and there was no more prime rib being served, and because I had already taken my plate to my table. they would not put it on the grill to cook it a bit more. I had to eat it if i wanted prime rib, so 3 inches by 3 inches from the middle was too raw to eat and looked like it just came from the package and never hit the oven. Lucky I ordered 2 pieces so there was just enough.  the worst part is my 3 year old grand son is charged full adult price for the worst buffet we have ever been to.  Tonight (Friday 10-16) my daughter is going to take me out for my birthday. Had to wait until her payday. My birthday was last Monday, 10-12. I am starving and can't wait for her to get home. If she wants to go to the Cannery, I will ask her to take me to the golden corral or sweet tomatoes. If she still insist i will have to decline and eat a can of generic raviolis. The raw meat did it for me, I am done with the Cannery buffet, I do not want to get food poisoning, at 55 I would most likely die.  Note: I just edited this to correct spelling and added the location (North Las Vegas). I just wanted to add it has been almost 2 years since I left this review. And nothing has changed, it is still the most nasty buffet that I have ever eaten. You want to go to a great buffet?, go to the RIO or ARIA. Yes you will pay $45 but it is well worth it"}
{"text":"Ok, I only came to eat at the Cannery Buffet because it is the closest to our neighborhood.  As for being a local here in Las Vegas for over 20 years, I've never seen lower quality food in my life...  It's so hard to understand why you wouldn't just put littler portions of food out instead of just letting large amounts of food sit out, and just turn into the most nastiest looking food you've ever seen.  I'll admit the salad bar/pizza was descent. . . But that was it. . . My Prime Rib was nothing but fat, if they would let me post a picture  of the food I picked up you would totally be disqusted and grossed out! The photos they show you are a HUGE LIE~ and should be deamed false advertising! Like Domino's Pizza your buffet needs a whole new outlook and assment! BLAH TO YOUR BUFFET!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst...worst food/buffet I've ever had in Vegas! Keep in mind I'm a Vegas local. Never again. Don't come here!!!!if I could have given ZERO star I would have! In the chicken dish and in the chicken soup, the off white meat had a tail attached to it"}
{"text":"We ate here on a recent visit to Vegas. We found it to be a decent meal for the price. We'd eat here again.  There was lot's of variety to choose from."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend yesterday for the Sunday brunch..I was here mostly for two items:lox and cocktail shrimp.Most of the meal I consumed consisted of these two things.They were both of good quality and quite enjoyable.I also ate some other stuff but not too much so I can't really give you an in depth description or evaluation of what they had.I should also mention that I had a 2 for 1 coupon.Our server was very attentive and came to our table frequently to remove empty plates.My friend took one bite from their seafood salad and thought it was horrible.I had some soft serve ice cream and wasn't impressed with it.So even though I am giving this buffet 5 stars,it is more reflective of the enjoyment I experienced from the lox and shrimp and the reduced price we paid yesterday.Your own individual mileage could definitely vary.I would certainly recommend coming here for the weekend brunch.Any other time,enter at your own risk.Use a 2 for 1 coupon if at all possible like I did or a player's card for a $2.00 discount.(If you have both the coupon and the player's card,they will honor the coupon but won't give you the additional $2.00 discount from the player's card) Good luck and enjoy your meal here."}
{"text":"Run from this buffet!!!!! The food looks like its been sitting there for weeks. You couldn't PAY me to eat the food. The only thing I can say is the staff is very nice and friendly. If you wanna make many trips to the bathroom , then is the food for u. Stick with taco bell. Its safer. Hey I dont want to be mean here, but its pretty hard to NOT lose your appetite while looking at the different selections of entrees. YELP!!!!!!! I must say we ate the rest of the time at the Victory club and the award winning mexican restaurant and they were fine....reasonable and the food was decent. The complete opposite. Stay away from the buffet unless you loose all your money in the casino and you are in need of food. Then and ONLY then would I even attempt to eat there. If you do, good luck and make sure you are near the bathroom the rest of the day!!!!"}
{"text":"Awful. Don't go for breakfast for sure. No meat to put in eggs or salad. I sampled several items & it was blah to gross. Skip it. Save your money & calories."}
{"text":"Excellent Service and Excellent Food!  Selection of food was better than your ordinary buffet.  Big thumbs up to the wonderful Chefs at the Cannery Row Buffet!  Can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"The food here was HORRIBLE! I went because  my daughter got a certificate from school to eat here so we went (wrong decision). But I asked to speak with the manager Mary and she was very nice and give me a refund. Will not go here again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went twice in one day; we had the 2 for 1 coupon so we cashed that in for lunch and 2 free vouchers, which we used for the much more expensive dinner.  It's OKAY because some of the choices are AMAZING and some are TERRIBLE but by no means should anyone pay $17/person for dinner!!!  LUNCH PRICES ARE MUCH MORE FAIR.  There is nothing better about dinner, they even keep a lot of the lunch choices out, so I cannot understand why it's twice the price....go for lunch!!"}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday so we had the Hawaiian buffet.  The huli chicken was a bit dry.  The fried rice was a little \"wet\" needs a little more vegies of some kind in it.  The flavor was a bit bland. The sushi was a bit hard.  The teri chicken was moist, nice flavor. The desserts wasnt disappointing.  Thanks for having jello!! Lol"}
{"text":"I go to the Cannery buffet at least once a month. I like using coupons they have every week that nearly cut the price of the buffet in half. Every station except the pasta area is very good. Most of the food is hot and fresh, however some of it looks as if it has  been sitting out for a few hours. I would recommend the pizza if it isn't dried out yet and any food item in the barbecue or dessert sections. The service could be a lot better and faster, but overall the service and food were good."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Buffet. I had a free comp so I used it here and I was highly disappointed. All of the food looked old and hardly anything was really palatable. Won't be back even if it's free again."}
{"text":"The fruit was good. The salad bar was fresh. The salmon with pasta was tasty. The Asian bar was mediocre-pad Thai didn't taste authentic. We didn't enjoy much else other than the items listed. Service was friendly. Not a bad price for a buffet however there wasn't much on it that we enjoyed."}
{"text":"Great food selection and freshness.   The wait staff is fast and friendly.  I'd have given it 5 stars if it was so full of smoke from the Casino.   Maybe a vent system?"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the food is always pretty good. If you sign up for a players card you get a discount on the price of the buffet, it's free to sign up. They have a good variety of foods, American, Asian, Italian, Hispanic. This is a good buffet because it's actually affordable with quality food plus you don't have to wait in a long line that goes around the building. There's also plenty parking so you're good."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to come here for lunch because she had a BOGO coupon (they send them regularly in the mail) and I didn't have high hopes, but figured it couldn't be that bad. The hostess said they currently only offer lunch and dinner during the week and breakfast is offered on the weekend. We were there for lunch anyway so no biggie. With a C.A.N. Club Card the price was $8.99 per person and $10.99 without card for the lunch buffet. Not a bad price for what you get. I didn't find anything spectacular tasting though not terrible and the selection wasn't huge, but they still had several buffet staples. Basically I found it to be average tasting with the pizza and salad being the best thing I had. For the price I couldn't complain and I left full. The dessert area has sugar-free offerings which is a nice option however everything I tried tasted bland and not too fresh. It wasn't very busy on the weekday I visited. Inside appeared clean and the hostess and person who refilled our drinks and cleared our plates was nice."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this place.  For it being a local casino,  the atmosphere was not very friendly.  The hostess was extremely rude.  She charged my 5 year old full price.  She's 5, are you kidding me?  All she could say was oh you need to get a players card.  Um....  That's dumb.  Then the food,  the food was horrible.  Hardly any selection, no taste and the food looked super old.  We paid $50 and got charged $8 for gratuity,  that's ridiculous.  Then we were standing outside the buffet waiting to leave and the security guard tried to be big and bad and said we weren't allowed to stand there with kids,  they were at least 5 feet away.  Since when did they change the rules.  Anyway,  if you want to get over charged and like rude people,  this is the place for you."}
{"text":"First of all, they have Mother F'in matzah! I hardly ever see that at a buffet. And it wasn't even Passover. How bow dah??  I'm not sure why this buffet got such mediocre reviews. For the price, I think it's reasonable. I agree that the line did take a while considering how short it was, but once we were sat service was pretty good. We went on a Wednesday night so this is for just a regular night (nothing special). We had a BOGO coupon for the buffet, which is pretty easy to get if you play their promotions or get their mailers.  The selection of cold food was pretty impressive. Salad bar looked fresh and they had some other mixed salads that were pretty good. Hot food was hit or miss. They has some things, but I would definitely say there wasn't a lot of variety compared to other buffets. It was decent enough.  I was really impressed by their carving station. They had ham, chicken, turkey, and beef (which wasn't even on the sign). No hot food stations tonight that I know of, which would have been nice.   Their desserts were actually decent as well. They had a variety of pies, some tasty bread pudding with whiskey sauce, and a couple flavors of bundt cakes (which were meh).  Overall this buffet won't blow you out of the water, but it's far from the worst. It's good enough if you're already on property, and definitely worth it if you have a coupon.   And of course... if you love matzah .. this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting, borderline inedible food with piss poor service.   We complained about the poor food quality and bad overall experience and were denied a refund only after we were given a really long run around and were treated like criminals. They went as far as to watch the cameras to see how many plates of food we grabbed..... On what planet is that normal? We were trying to find something worth a shit to eat at the worst buffet in Vegas. Excuse the shit outta me for not trying to just give yall $30 for dinner and then leave.  I would honestly rather starve than ever come eat here again.   Please avoid this place at all costs. It's honestly not worth it. Just go to McDonald's across the street."}
{"text":"This is the worst buffet I've ever been to.  The price is low, but the Station Casino's Feast buffet is around the same price and way better than this.  The size is so tiny and the offerings are so mediocre.  Whenever I go to a buffet make sure to try the carving station and the dessert area, both of which were so terrible.  The beef roast was dry and even gravy couldn't fix the dry and bland taste. I also tried the mashed potatoes, which were sad.  I could make better mashed potatoes.  They seemed over-processed and they were also bland.  I also tried the roast pork and it had a very bland gravy, but the brown gravy with it fixed it a little.  The dessert was the worst part.  My boyfriend had the pumpkin pie and he said it didn't taste like pumpkin pie and it had a weird gelatinous texture.  The crusts for the pies were also weak.  They tasted and looked premade.   The only positive I can say is that the service was great....but it doesn't make up for the bad food.  Even if you could go here for free....just don't.  I walked away feeling sick and sad."}
{"text":"I ate at the Cannery Row Buffet on Boulder Hwy. on Monday Oct 1, 2012.  I had eaten there about a year ago and wasn't impressed then...and it seems to have gone downhill since. My first complaint was, the buffet had been open for two hours and no one had put any utensils for the condiments (No spoons so a person could put onions, sauce, or toppings, etc.).  How can someone not have noticed?  Second, the fried chicken was so greasy and looked as it had been set out the day before,....and every piece was cut so the back of the chicken was the largest portion of the piece...how can this be?  The \"homemade\" meatloaf was similar to the taste of cardboard...except..cardboard had a better flavor.  The pizza looked worth a try but tasted like imitation grease and imitation cheese.  I had a piece of chocolate cake with ice cream for desert and had no complaints with that.  On the up side...there was no line going in and no babies crying or kids running around playing tag as, I being 64 years old,...was the youngest person there.  The casino itself had many machines available for play, but I was so dissappointed in the lunch, I left with the intent to return and see if there have been improvements.     It's March 8th, 2013 and I read my comments here and have not returned to the Cannery East but will do so again soon to see if there have been improvements and give them another chance"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple different times and it follows my rule of cheap buffets are not good and good buffets are not cheap. It's definitely not the best thing ever, but it's not horrendous. (It should be noted that both times I went on a weekend for the brunch offerings with a lot of people, so the food turnaround is pretty good and nothing looks like it's been sitting for too terribly long.) Just a middle-of-the-road buffet with some good options."}
{"text":"I must say I was impressed my food was awesome..I thoroughly Enjoyed the soul food station as they had greens,cat fish,jambalaya,baked beans and the Macaroni and cheese was to die for...the Mexican was a tasty option the Carnitas was very Juicy...The cook at the Italian station will make any pizza u want if u just ask I had one with the works and was very impressed with the outcome....The line was short...Hostess and waiter was great and so was the music...The only reason I didn't give five stars Is people in my party order additional cost steaks which they didn't want because they looked dry and inedible...and when they asked for a refund they were given a hard time and not refunded.."}
{"text":"The last time I ate here was years ago. Unfortunately, I'd have to say the food was way better back then. I came on a Thursday which meant Steak and Shrimp night which stated 13.99, even though I used my card the total was 15.19. I'm never coming here again for dinner with it being $15. Everything looked and tasted like it has been out for hours. The Mac and cheese weren't even warm, but slightly cold. The meats were also dry. And my raspberry iced tea tasted really watered down. I have to say that the people here were awfully nice though. Waiter came a few times asking if we'd like refills and he always had a smile on his face. Very friendly service. I just wonder what happened to the food that was served long ago to the current selection they have now. It just seems a little odd to me. Next time someone suggests to eat at this buffet I'm going to have to debate about it."}
{"text":"This as to be the WORST Buffet we have ever eaten in.  All the meat dishes were dry and tough.  Every dish and we do mean every dish was tasteless, there was no flavor.  The cakes in the Dessert Bar were dry and actually hard.  We would not eat here again, even if it was free.  Do yourself a great favor and stay away from this Buffet."}
{"text":"This 3 star rating is for the food.  The food is OK here but when you combine it with the cheap price it is worth going.  I probably eat here a couple times a month.  Its good cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Came back again last week and for a Monday night, the food was terrific! It is honestly way better than most of the typical buffets you get on the Strip and a third of the price. Love the baked salmon, salad bar, and soup options!"}
{"text":"I really like this buffet, but I don't take advantage of their offerings to get the most out of it.  There's a baked potato area with lots of fixings so you can make your own loaded potato.  I generally don't eat potatoes, so I've passed on this each time although I salivate when going by.  The Italian area has a cook to order section with ingredients such as shrimp, spinach, mushrooms, onions, peppers, etc.  I generally don't eat pasta, so I pass on this, too!  See a trend!  I do eat their loin of pork, the pepper chicken in the Asian section was great yesterday, and the pot stickers were good.  They have pork nuggets so you can put on your own sweet and sour sauce or Orange sauce which are in containers.  The one disappointment was they didn't have these melt away confectioner sugar coated cookies yesterday.  I really love those little critters.  There's nothing to them, and they almost melt in your mouth.  It's such a simple little cookie, but a dessert I look forward to getting.  They didn't have any yesterday!  I'll return.  One of these days one of the bakers is going to be mine!"}
{"text":"The food here has way to much salt. The only thing that was decent was the salad I had.  I will never come here again. The food here is not worth $16 . I would rather go somewhere else.  Eat here at your own risk. The service is good,  but that is it."}
{"text":"To put it simply: I would rather get eaten by a Great White shark than to ever eat here again.  I would rather poke my eye out with a lit cigarette than to ever eat here again.  Honestly, even if you were starving to death or just got out of a lifetime prison sentence,  I still wouldn't send you here to eat.  The one star was for the mediocre piece of coconut cream pie that I had for dessert and the ice-tea which I needed to swash and wash the horrible taste out of my mouth from eating or attempting to eat any food here. It's like the worse tasting TV Dinner food.   No military discount? No child discount? $56 for a family of four?    If you want cheap go to In & Out Burger, you'll get your money's worth plus it's delicious!!  The service at each station was bad too.    Our waitress however, was very attentive and friendly.   Overall: Depends where your bar is. Foodies stay away."}
{"text":"I went to eat there yesterday, it was bad!,,, food is dry, it is not worth it for the price, I remember 3years ago this was a great place to eat. I would say not good..."}
{"text":"I usually go to a buffet for Thanksgiving, and this was probably my best experience to date.  It helped that I got there early--a little after 2 pm.  The buffet wasn't crowded, and the line was short. I was seated in less than 10 minutes.  The Thanksgiving items were great. Everything else I tried was at least good. And it was inexpensive--I don't have their players' card, but I still got change back from a $20."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst buffet! Hoped to have a nice fatgers day breakfast with my family....9:30 a.m. , $47.55 for 2 adults, 1child. Food was terrible and the cigarette smell over powered. Never going back!!! Sgould be no stars...."}
{"text":"Honestly for their price this place is pretty decent. This is my second time here.   I go straight for their prime rib. The cut was soft. I came back to get the well done piece, the first one was amazing, but the third time I came back it was hard as a rock.   If their dessert selection and presentation was better I would up the stars to four total."}
{"text":"Food: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Cleanliness: 4/5 Decor & Style: 3/5  Not one of the better buffets in vegas however we had free meal comps here so decided to give it a try. Most of the food was dry. Next time i'll pass and maybe give my comp to someone else. Large variety here at least."}
{"text":"This wasn't the best buffet in the world, but the price is right. It's somewhere around $15 to get in, which is reasonable as hell considering how much I eat. Try the mussels, they're bomb. My friends and I went on Father's Day and there was unlimited beer. Not a bad deal!  Like most buffets, you can get fresh roast beef sliced for yourself, so indulge. For breakfast, check out the omelettes; they're huge. Also mimosas in the morning!!"}
{"text":"Located in The Eastside Cannery Hotel Casino on the Boulder Strip. A very reasonable buffet. There was no line when I went on Hawaiian night. The food was fresh and hot. Everything I had was good. I will go back for the champagne brunch, I will let you know how that is. Locals look out for offers in the mail. So if you are that part of town and want a cheep and easy buffet, this is your place.  Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Chicken a La King for dinner buffet... so if you are into TV dinner quality buffet, this is the place for you. Granted buffets are not the gourmet experience, and quality and freshness range from frozen TV dinner to a good cafeteria / wedding buffet food.  It is with this gauge I rate my buffet offerings.  The worst item was steamed Beef Round... it was so hard and unedible, worse than TV dinner.  1 bite, tossed... what a waste of a good cow.  Meatball was the best thing there, which I think any decent cook can muster up (just go to Food network for a good recipee).  Tilapia had a wierd taste too.  Only reason I suffered through a old style casino full of stinky smoke filled to endure this buffet was for my friend..."}
{"text":"On a Saturday nite at 6pm there was NO line & that always scares the HELL out of me but I was hungry & went for it anyways.  $12.99 per person, no 1/2 price for kids. The buffet is small with 6 stations-salad,dessert,asian,southern,carving station and mexican.  It is way limited too with like 6-8 items per station and nothing special.  The best thing was not having to wait but that also meant they kept food out way too long and alot of items were dried out from being under a heat lamp for too long.  I don't understand why chinese food is made in advance anyways-everything is freakin chicken & cooks in a WOK in like 60 seconds!   Wouldn't that add some flare & get people coming back. To me everything looked dried out,pastey sauces and just \"NOT going on my plate even for a picture at a buffet BAD!\"  The majority of the stations were just like that-Food that had been sitting way too long.  I stuck to the soup,salad and desserts but did have some decent ribs, really good medium-rare prime rib and I liked the cream spinach.  Strange thing about the salad bar-they had to have an attendant because it was too far to reach behind the sneeze guard to get to the items. WEIRD!  The 2 best things were the SERVICE & NO line. We never once had to wait on drinks and the napkins & handy wipes were plentiful.  If you dont like waiting in a line-are good with soup & salad, some prime-rib for $13 give it a go, otherwise it's just average at best."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner on a Saturday night for dinner and this place was almost empty.  I was a little worried since the lack of patronage was not a good sign.  The buffet is not bad but it is not great either.  Fare is simple.  There is a decent selection of items and with the lack of guest I figured the food may have been sitting around awhile.  Food is decent for a buffet.  Las Vegas has a lot better buffets but I have also been to worst buffets.  I would eat here again if I wanted to stay off the strip and not pay a lot.  Price is good for what you get.  Table staff and the staff working the carving station were really nice on my visit.  I like my roast beef medium rare.  The staff at the carving station got a new serving of roast beef for me and they were closing soon.  Nice service."}
{"text":"Off beat Vegas casino, with an okay buffet.  The wait service is great, super friendly and helpful but the host and seater are one of the rudest people EVER in Vegas.    Food was okay and a variety of cuisine's was fun. Would I recommend it? Sure, if you are super hungry and in need of a break from gambling.  But if you have the time and energy, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this location for Sunday Champagne Brunch.  It was located in the Cannery Casino on E Craig Road in Las Vegas.  We had free buffet coupons from spinning the wheel on Web Pass.  The stations were not labeled, so you had to walk up to see what there was.  At the Cannery Row Buffet on Boulder Highway, the stations were clearly marked with big signs.  They had American, Asian, Italian, Mexican, 2 large Salad Bars, and Desserts. The server took our drink order and brought us drinks and cleared our empty plates.  We were not offered champagne.  For brunch there was a made to order omlette station.  This was probably the best and freshest feature.  There was no Egg Benedict.  The bacon was limp and greasy.  The hash browns were shredded and burned.  The sausage links had a lot of filler.  The gravy for the Biscuits and Gravy had been sitting there for a while.  The Italian meatballs were large, but had a lot of filler.  The tortellini was meh.  The taquitos were ok if you like the kind that come in the freezer section.  The cheese sauce was runny.  There were tamales wrapped in plastic wrap that I did not try.   The potstickers were dried out and fried.  The Broccoli Beef was okay, but had thin strips of beef.   The egg rolls were tastless.  The pepperoni pizza was okay when it was fresh and hot.  There was cheese bread.  The salad bar had lettuce, lots of toppings, pasta salad, ambrosia, assorted fruit, rolls, etc.  This was much nicer than the Cannery Row Buffet on Boulder Highway.  Again, the desserts were the best part of the meal.  I had to ask for the Coconut Cream Pie.  Yumm!  The Apple Custard Tart was good (I had 2 slices).  There was Boston Cream Pie, Carrot Cake, Cheesecake, Tiramisu, wedding cookies, soft-serve ice cream, and plenty of sugar-free desserts."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to this location.  We came for lunch about 30 minutes after they opened.  I had another coupon for 2 free buffets for spinning the wheel on Web Pass.    The food was less dried out.  The broccoli in the Broccoli Beef was over cooked, but the beef was tender.  There were no potstickers today, only egg rolls and clam strips which I did not try.  The salad bar was larger, but they took away the sushi section.  I tried the pepperoni pizza again.  It was okay.  I did not see anyone at the carving station or the pasta station.  The chewy peanut butter cookies and coconut cream pie were good as usual.  I ate them first.  I would come back just for the desserts."}
{"text":"Poor food selection compared to other cheaper buffets and given that I have food allergies. Minimal vegetables. The food gave me an upset stomach. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"My friend has been asking me to come to the Cannery for awhile because she gets buy one get one free coupons here. I finally braved the 15 freeway (which I'm secretly scared of) to meet her for an early dinner. I liked the pulled pork which I made into a sandwich. I also had ribs, mashed potatoes and popcorn shrimp. Those items were average but they didn't taste bad. I actually ate salad which for the most part doesn't happen when I'm at a buffet. What made me do such a thing is they had egg crumples there! I don't see that too much so I made a nice salad with a spring mix of greens, red onion, mushrooms, cheese, cucumbers, peeled sunflower seeds, my beloved egg crumples and drizzled it with some ranch. It was so satisfying I didn't even graze over the desserts! The bill for the both of us after the coupon not including the tip was $8.46....not bad for a buffet!"}
{"text":"Had a 2 free buffet coupon... Would never pay for this buffet. Gross.. Food is questionable, buffet utensils were sticky and dirty. I ate the prime rib and a sweet potato and called it a day. Stomach hurt after and everytime I thought about the buffet I wanted to puke. In my opinion this place is only open for the free buffet coupons that they give you for gambling... Yuck Yuck and more Yuck!"}
{"text":"wow.  this was comp'd buffet and i thought id try it all i can say is i would rather pay to go somewhere else   food is dry and terrible  no flavor at all i wouldnt be surprise if it came from a can  dont waste your money here  up the road is Aliante Buffet at Aliante Casino  So much nicer  and WAYYYYY better food"}
{"text":"Priced right at $10.99 for lunch. Most of the food was good, but the pizza looked like it was sitting out for an hour. I didnt even bother trying since there was a lot of other food that I like."}
{"text":"We just took advantage, of the current promotion: an all day $7 Sunday Buffet.   As expected, the quality of the food was okay. In other words it was not bad nor great."}
{"text":"This was a good buffet for the price.  With the players club you get a a discount and discounts are always good.  There was a lot of variety in food served.  The prime rib was delicious as was the salad and other items.  We didn't care so much for some of the desserts.  The pecan pie had little taste.    However, we'd still return for another one.    Slots are really tight at this casino."}
{"text":"VERY good buffet value here.  All you can eat of course and the shrimp is to die for.  Saddle up $15 and grub like there is no Jenny Craig!"}
{"text":"I've tried to like this place. Really, I have. I tried when it was initially little serving dishes of food that you could help yourself to. The food was good then.  I tried it when it switched to family style, where you order a big plate of each dish for like 12 bucks and get enough to feed 3 people per, and can share it... The food was good the first time, acceptable the second time and bleh the third time.  When it swapped to buffet? Today was the first time I've tried it. The food was disappointing to say the best. Sean, and our friend and I ended up tossing about half the stuff we took. The crab rangoons were dried out and nasty. The lasagna was simply boring. The turkey was dry, and the desserts failed on so many levels.  It's a shame they got rid of the good staff they had a year and a half ago when this opened originally.   They also wouldn't accept a clearly marked \"Cannery Row Buffet\" coupon that was sent, because \"That was sent from the north location.\" Nowhere on the coupon does it say it's only good at the one location, so technically you DO have to accept it. We didn't end up making a stink about it though.  The 1 star is not because Yelp forces me to give at least one (which is bullshit)... The one star comes from the very attentive waiter we had, who knew exactly when to refill our drinks and take plates etc. without hovering or being annoying. Kudos to him and I hope one day he can find a better place to work."}
{"text":"Went only because of a 2 for 1 coupon and then saw it was prime rib and shrimp night which I thought would be exciting. Wrong. They only had one shrimp choice which was fried jumbo shrimp. No grilled,scampi, nothin. All the food looked questionable and nothing was worth coming back for. Prime rib was the most bland I've ever had. Most food was tasteless. Only thing really edible was the cornbread stuffing. I would definitely pass and try elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place was horrible .the good was stale and gross and it seemed very old ... My server did an awesome job but the food still sucked ....."}
{"text":"Terribad. I read it was supposed to be prime rib and shrimp night. At least thats what it said on the website. The only shrimp I saw were in the Asian food area: the shrimp fried rice (flavorless), and fried shrimp (probably the best thing on the buffet). The \"prime rib\" tasted like it was warmed up in the microwave. Everything was very bland and typical buffet food. Definitely wasn't worth $15. Go across the street and get steak and lobster for $11 instead. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. $10 per adult for Saturday night dinner ($12 minus $2 for player's card) but $11 per child? Ridiculous, when Stations are running better prices for more selection.  The foods were all low-price filler items that looked \"sat out\", and I couldn't see any dishes that would justify the extra few dollars over what other casinos are charging.  Everything seemed mediocre. I liked the baked potato bar best.  I'm going to stick with Sunset Station for bargain buffet in my neighborhood.  A sign promoted $7 buffet on Sunday, which should be the price every day."}
{"text":"I know i say sometimes you need a buffet... well this is the exception.  Luckily i went for sunday brunch, that gave it the extra star. Made to order omelets and however else you want the egg cooked saved my experience.  The food was just gross. Dried up and tasteless even with all the salt.  I stuck to the breakfast items and was okay with that.  No extra charges for coffee which was nice.  Guess you can have champagne at the brunch but i dont touch thay stuff."}
{"text":"A smaller buffet off-strip. Good place to come for cheap, typical american food. Not great, not bad. The restaurant is clean and the service is very good. Nothing spectacular to report."}
{"text":"Well I should make 2 reviews really because one time it deserved 2 stars and another time 4 stars! First time we went here it was a regular buffet day and the food was not super, but ok... the second time we came was with new years eve.. we had free buffet tickets and sushi was on the menu that night, so we decided to give it another shot.. this time the food was very good. the sushi was very nice and the refried breans were nice too. for the personal in the buffet, well 5 stars! a nice blonde lady from south america (I believe she was from Paraguay) very nice lady with excellent service and the african american lady that makes the pasta's ready for you, also very good service..."}
{"text":"The Cannery Row Buffet hasn't changed much regarding their food.  They have a wide selection, however the quality of food is average at best and it seems that every time you go it's the same items they never change, they never look to mix it up a little bit for their customers you are pretty much almost guaranteed to see the same food every time you eat there.  The one thing that I do have to say about the buffet is that it is always clean and organized,as a customer that means a lot to me.  The customer service is always good,I have never had a complaint about the service I received because for the most part they do take good care of you.  If you do decide to go to the cannery make sure you have your players card so you can get a discount, today is Saturday I was there at 2:30 PM and brunch was still going on original price was $12.99 plus tax was $13.80 but with the card I ended up paying only $10.80 which is not a bad deal at all.  For the most part the buffet is OK,it's reasonably priced with your card, it's not the worst buffet but it's not the best either."}
{"text":"Before our movie, we decided to go to the buffet, because why not? It was only $10.99 for dinner (with your player's card). I really regret this decision.  The buffet is very spacious. Lots of seating, both booths and table tops. Super accommodating for large parties, but doesn't really matter if the food is bad. The buffet offers different types of food: Asian, Mexican, southern comfort, meat station, Italian, salad bar and desserts. I didn't really have the best of experience at any station. All the food seemed to be old, sitting under heat lamps all day and overcooked.   Salmon - overcooked and the sauce had a dry film on it  Fried catfish and shrimp - more batter than protein, batter was too hard and protein was overcooked  Carved round beef - all well done, no temperature choices. That meant overcooked tough meat  Fried won ton - hard shell, overcooked  Meatballs - seemed to have been previously frozen  Ham - probably the best thing in that buffet. Soft and nicely cooked. Keep in mind, it was the best thing there, not the best thing ever  Ribs - There were no ribs, just bones. Nothing on the bone.   Overall, I must say, the best thing at that buffet had to have been the white rice on the Asian line. It was nicely prepared. So sad to say it but it was true. I literally ate a plate full of rice and au jus.   Simply put, I will probably never come back to this buffet. Even at a $10 price tag, I'd rather go across the street and enjoy Sonic or Panda Express."}
{"text":"We come here about 3 times a month due to the bogo coupon we get in the mail. (Adding up to $5 per person). Otherwise we'd only be at the Cannery for the Luxury Theaters only.  The buffet is pretty simple. Pizza, pasta, bbq, Mexican and asian. We come mid day around 12-1300, which at this time they switch out the breakfast for lunch. The staff is always friendly to us. No complaints so far.   The food is the same everytime we go. Nothing too distinguishing or exciting to write about. It's a great place for a cheap eat when you want to fill up. Sign up for their can can card and start receiving the bogo coupon.    Overal great and fast service. Limited but good eats. 3 stars for price, convenience and customer service."}
{"text":"This place is great for the price. It has a little of everything. The people are very friendly and the service is quick. If your looking for something off the strip this place is great."}
{"text":"The buffet needs help...!! I get it , it's a buffet and I'm not complaining for 6 bucks BUT let's go people step it up just a bit."}
{"text":"great  buffet love  the coupon for 2 for 1 always clean and not alot of  people  servers are very friendly  as well"}
{"text":"Despite the 2.5 rating on yelp, the food can be compared to a average home town buffet without the selection. Overall the food was okay and your better off going to the In-n-out down the street for a bomb ass juicy burger. In addition, there is the smoke from the nearby casino that permeates the buffet, so if your into that then this place is definitely your bet. Otherwise, I'll dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Really battling Circus Circus for the WORST buffet in town. Poor selection and food is not at all well prepared. Cafe is better...but service in Cafe is horrible. Drive to downtown if you want a GOOD buffet...Main Street Station has a wide selection and is well prepared. Worth the extra 15 minute drive to get there!"}
{"text":"This is the typical buffet.. not to bad.. the food was fresh and the waitress was good at keeping the mimosas full def a plus. Good place to try locals welcome.. get the players card it will save you a couple dollars for each buffet, 2 people for each card..."}
{"text":"This was my fourth time eating at the Cannery buffet over a time span of a year and a half,  and I have to say,  the quality in food has steadily deteriorated. The only reason I'm giving this buffet two stars instead of one is solely because the service was good. The buffet attendants were friendly and our server kept the table clear and our drinks full.  The food was an entirely different matter.  We came in at 4 PM for dinner. All the food looked as if it had been sitting out for hours. The cheese on the pizzas looked discolored and caked over. Pretty much everything looked dried out.  Me and the two other people I was with were so dissatisfied that we left the buffet hungry.  I tried food from the Asian station, as well as the American station. I gave up after that and settled on a bowl of ice cream from the dispenser. Final verdict: save your money and go to the buffet at Aliante or Sante Fe Station instead."}
{"text":"The food was tasteless and often what you think something is, isn't. We waited to pay and to be seated. It's by far the smallest buffet I've ever had the misfortune of eating in. We only went because we had a buy one, get one free coupon, and even then we fell we overpaid. Poor selection. The deserts were the biggest disappointment. The pecan pie was horrid, the cookies were awful, and sadly, I was just a disappointment. I've been to the Westside Cannery buffet and it's a thousand times better. The only redeeming quality was the server. She kept moving and took care of our needs, and the needs of those around us."}
{"text":"We came on a Wednesday evening and had they Shrimptacular Buffet. We had a coupon in the mail for a BOGO. One person with tax comes out to $21.61 1. Shrimp shumai 2. Honey walnut shrimp 3. shrimp curry 4. Firecracker shrimp 5. Shrimp fried rice 6. Shrimp cocktail 7. Fried battered shrimp 8. Shrimp pizza 9. Shrimp scampi 10. Shrimp fettuccine (chef prepared) 11. Fried chicken, jumbalaya, beef tacos (non-shrimp) 12. bread pudding, lemon meringue pie, ice cream, m&m cookie  - Closes at 8pm.  - Coming to the Buffet around 7:30, there was no line and we were seated right away. - Food was pretty much left overs by then. Nothing steaming hot except for the fried battered shrimp. Seems like that is very popular.  - I helped myself with multiple serving of the walnut shrimp and picked for more walnut.  - Worth the money. Presentation was sloppy, but filled my stomach fine.   We came on a Sunday evening for their regular buffet.  $14.04 BOGO 1. Shrimp Alfredo 2. Tostada with rice and beans 3. Salad 4. Prime rib, broccoli, and mashed potatoes 5. Pepperoni Pizzas   - Salad bar. Chinese. American. Mexican. Italian. - Rubbery and flavorless prime rib. Reminds me of Silver 7s buffet. Add salt, pepper, au jus - Not as good as their Wednesday buffet, but it is a nice change of scenery rather than going to a Feast buffet every now and then. - Occasionally, we would walk to the soda fountain and just fill up our own drinks since service was a bit slow, or maybe they were understaffed.  - Definitely not my good to buffet, but good when ballin' on a budget!  - Not better than Feast at Sunset, GVR, Boulder station. Maybe comparable to Fiesta. I'd go to Sam's Town buffet, if on Boulder when getting picky.  Coupons come in the mail. Good deal."}
{"text":"It's about 13.00 for two people with the buy one get one monthly coupon and the players card.  The food is BAD but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"Not good. McDonald's would have been better. Selection was weird. Never been to buffet that didn't have some kind of beef selection. It was just odd things. Tamales looked good but the  taste was off. Salad was sad. Pie had that film it gets when it sits sliced too long. Went with two other people all of had different things and none of us liked what we got. Has a lot of potential if the stuff would have tasted good, we could have dealt with the weird choices but alas it wasn't. Totally marking this place off the list of places to return to. No line at 5pm should have been a clue."}
{"text":"This was a Decent buffet. My friend told me to go for lunch right before they change to dinner. And youll get the Dinner buffet at the Lunch Price. The Waiter was friendly. It did take the Host a while to come back after i paid the cashier to seat me. But she seemed stretched a little thin with her duties i will be back again to eat here. Usually my biggest complaint and a Buffet is how they never keep my soda refilled. I didnt have that complaint here. He cleared the table of empty plates and made sure we didnt have empty drink cups."}
{"text":"Not even worth 5 dlls. They need to put more effort in the food.  The French Toast were really hard,  couldnt even bite. The only good thing was the fresh fruit, not even the fresh made omelets were good.  Was very disappointed in their breakfast."}
{"text":"One of the benefits of staying and dining in Las Vegas is the budget options available. We look for bargains, so we usually land at one of the Station hotels paying $35 to $55 per night (including resort fees). So we have had the chance to try the buffets at the Fiesta Henderson and Boulder Station. Both had better food and more items to choose from, and they cost less with a Station card. We got a Can Club card after check-in to take advantage of the $11.99 buffet (normally $14.99). When we got to the buffet we were charged the full $14.99 and were told it would have been more without the Can Club card. We checked the hours and date and should have qualified for the $11.99 advertised price. So either the ad was wrong or we were overcharged $3 per person. The prime rib was fine, as were the mashed potatoes and a few other things, but most of the food was average at best. The sushi? Methinks not. The shrimp? Overbreaded and nearing its expiration date. The desserts were below average. Next time we'll take our Station card and go up the street for dinner at Boulder Station if in the mood for buffet."}
{"text":"loved it, ate there twice in 1 week. i loved the pasta station the most, the meatballs were to die for. salad bar was typical the mexican on the other hand was a big yuck. the taquitos were realy grose, iv had better from a box out of the freezer section and i dont think the gaumolie was store bough because iv had fresh, and that was not fresh. but not a bad price, the food is over all pretty good."}
{"text":"This buffet is still as bad as it's been forever....It's basically the same old same old each and every day. My partner and I tried their Prime Rib & Shrimp Buffet one Thursday night. The Prime Rib was rare, the way I like it, but it had no marbling in it - It was tougher than a piece of leather. And the shrimp? All they had was old, cold burned and extra crunchy fried shrimp, peel & eat shrimp and popcorn shrimp - not much of a Vegas \"feast.\" Cannery Buffet is extraordinarily over priced for what they offer! For $13.99, we probably would've been better off going to Golden Corral!"}
{"text":"Great selection of food. Our kids enjoyed it as well. My salad wasn't great tho. That got like 2stars actually. But everything else was pretty good. We'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"Finally I get a chance to leave this review that's been on the back of my mind.   This review is for Roy the chef that works the omelette station.   I know people don't expect a lot from this buffet, but that egg station is a hidden gem!!  That man working omelettes makes that station his B****!!!   It almost seems like he's got multiple arms!! Haha   I asked for my omelette with egg white ham bacon cheese on top and a little under cooked (personal choice) and he delivered exactly that even showed me my food before he plated it to make sure I was happy with It.   Make sure you take care of him like he cares for your food!!   I will be back Just for some eggs!"}
{"text":"Not my first time here....BUT TODAY THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS!!!! Fresh fried catfish, sweet potatoes, Mac and cheese all good. My honey had oxtails and dirty rice, he said it was all well seasoned. This is usually a last resort spot but today it was the best choice. Hats off to the Chef today!"}
{"text":"Cheap and for a good reason. A friend dragged me there a couple of weeks ago for a Sunday branch, 95% of the food was not fit for human consumption, The salad bar was the only salvation, service was below mediocre. I left hungry and wondered why the heck I drove all the way cross town to \"dine\" at this joint."}
{"text":"Used to be really cheap with a few nice selection but they doubled their price and seemed to have halved their selection too!! Boo"}
{"text":"I have to say this buffet is hit or miss. Sometimes it is really good and other times it was like the cooks threw the food together and did not care how it tasted, The desserts are always really good someone knows how to make them. For the price it is ok . If you play in the casino you will get free buffets or buy one get one. You can not go wrong then."}
{"text":"For the price you pay and the grub you get... i'd have to say it's top shelf. The steak is so-so but what can you expect at a buffet? Everything else is awesome. The fried chicken was pretty good and so was this squid dish which i'm kinda sure is an italian thing, either way, it was bomb. If you're in North Las Vegas for some reason and wanna grub on down but don't want to hit up the strip, then you've just found your answer. (There's also a sonic's right across the street just in case you're a fatty fat fat and want a banana cream pie shake after you get your grub on)"}
{"text":"Tough to review. Sometimes really good sometimes terrible. Prime rib and shrimp night is the best time to give it a try. Sometimes the prime rib is way too overdone but there are good nights. Standard buffet was no good at all. Stick to the specialty night (prime rib/shrimp) Make sure to have a players card for a discount!"}
{"text":"Great service, from the hole staff, our server was amazing!!  and she made us feel like family.....delicious mimosas and the food was really good! Pay with your players card, much more worth it!"}
{"text":"Stay away ...far away ...bad food. Always cold no taste. Upset stomach within the hour. Some staff are freindly, some not so much. Closes at 8 pm ."}
{"text":"Horrible food.  Yes, it's cheap, but no cheaper than Boulder or Fiesta, and they are MUCH better.  The food at Cannery Row either has no taste, or is so overcooked and dry.....or is both tasteless and dry.  We never use our free buffet coupons - ever.  That should tell you something...we won't even eat there for free.    Skip this place - for the same price, there are much better options out there."}
{"text":"For the 2 for 1 deal on certain days, it's not bad, but you can probably do a better buffet for a reasonable price like at Red Rock Casino. Not too many selections to choose from.   The buffet offers your typical dishes like Chinese, Italian, Mexican but no Japanese. Prime rib, smoked salmon and your typical salad bar are also offered.   Best thing I ate: seafood marinara (yummy squid and shrimp)  Worse thing I ate: sauteed shrimp (very mushy, not fresh)  Overall, cheap buffet, but not as satisfying."}
{"text":"First place that actually refillef my drink! There setup was not all the great. Some of the dishes didn't even look fresh. I like that they had the dessert near the entrance because that's the most important display...at least in my opinion. I need to know how much space to save! The server was very attentive and friendly. She refilled my drink without being asked..that may not seem important to most, but after eating at numerous places to my shock and dismay, they never refilled or even asked. I was confused as to why they had mexican dishes in the american section as well.  Not one of my top choices but it is cheap and service was good.  Another great thing about this place. SELF SERVE EGGS BENEDICT! oh my...i couldn't help myself at this station."}
