{"text":"My favourite bakery,
I love their hot-table stuffed eggpant or zuccini the best.
I've gone there ever since childhood and feel like I got to know their family be seeing them all the time and seeing them grow- you can see it's a very nice family business
From desserts to fresh baked bread, green tea gingerale Canada dry (yes, I know I can find them a lot of places but this is my go to), cooking ingredients and cakes, it's all very good quality. The make their own bread by scratch which is a big plus! I have also seen them growing plants at the corner of their store to use as fresh ingredients, very nice!"}
{"text":"Pretty good bakery, very nice staff. Came to try their Cannoli, it was pretty good. Got some rolls as well and a few others things."}
{"text":"Buscabamos una bakery para tomar un buen cafe acompañado de un pastel/bollo. Hemos tomado 2 lattes y dos pastelitos. 14 dolares. Los cafes eran pasables pero los postres no nos han gustado nada. Creo que eran de hace 2 dias... Demasiado caro para tan mediocre calidad."}
{"text":"I flew back from Vancouver for this place... amazing authentic stuff"}
{"text":"Nice local corner Bakery with all kinds of Italian goodies. They have deli, bread, dessert and food section and much more. They have an expresso section and a seating area for people to enjoy it.

The Staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Great deli and fresh bread/buns. Hot table is has lots of variety and there is also a place to sit.  The pasteries are very delicious."}
{"text":"Even though I've lived in the Meadowvale/Churchill Meadows area of Mississauga for most of my life, I've admittedly walked into this family-owned Italian bakery a handful of times. When I was younger, I would primarily go here to satisfy my cravings for European sweets (without paying too much attention to their wide assortment of breads). Now that I am older, I tend to seek the greater things in life (read: fresh bread and coffee).

As I was feeling particularly overwhelmed this morning by the pervasive presence of Starbucks and Timmies (even if they are the hallmarks of suburbia), I decided to change up my morning coffee routine by treating myself with a quick trip to the Britannia Italian Bakery.

Upon entering the establishment, I immediately experienced a blast to the past (1999 to be precise), which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I proceeded to the \"espresso counter,\" and ordered a cappuccino from the barista. To be completely honest, this Italian bakery (among others of the sort) is probably your only safe haven away from the \"Pumpkin Spice\" craze. All you can enjoy here is espresso in its most natural state, without the tampering of any additional spices (with the exception of cinnamon).
 
While the cappuccino isn't as rich as something you would find at Social Club in Montréal, it is pretty dang good for Mississauga standards. Also, you probably won't have to wait in line to be served, which is doubly fantastic if you're in a rush. If you're keen on having your espresso \"to stay,\" there is a cute sitting area (in a late 1990's sort of way) towards the south-west corner of the bakery."}
{"text":"Cute and pretty cheap bakery within walking distance from my house. My doctors office is in the same plaxa, so I just drop by here. It's pretty good."}
{"text":"I bought a cake from them this week and was a bit disappointed. The staff is aloof, which is off putting. The cake itself looked very nice, but I asked for hazelnut and it did not taste much like hazelnut. All in all, it left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Maybe I came on the wrong day??  Whatever the case may be, it was very quiet on a Sunday, mid-late afternoon, a coupla hours prior to closing.

Sure, prices are quite decent $1.99 for a large cannoli (crispy but I didn't like the filling), $2.25 for a large lobster tail pastry (a bit hard, same/similar filling as cannoli), $1.99 for a slice of pizza (looked very dry), and caffeinated drinks were well priced, but nothing that I got was very memorable.

Aside from the girl behind the hot table, who looked as though she wanted to be elsewhere, the 2 other females seemed friendly.

While I was there, a customer did complain about the coffee being undrinkable.  So the staff made a new pot for her.  

Perhaps the pastries are better during a quicker turnover rate.  Buns/breads looked better."}
