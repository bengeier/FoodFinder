{"text":"THE BEST in Toronto. I never give 5 stars for restaurants, and this place blew my expectations in every way. Food was absolutely amazing. Top-notch service. This restaurant is one of the few traditional, perfect places left in Toronto."}
{"text":"Only the best at Chiado. Had the grilled squid, tiger shrimp in piri piri sauce, goat cheese eggplant and mushroom appetizer, black cod for my main dish and poached pear tart for dessert. Still thinking about it this morning.. There's a reason they are around after 25 years."}
{"text":"Amazing experience at Chiado. Went for the first time with three friends, though we were late for our lunch reservation, the gentleman at the desk wasn't concerned and led us to a table. The first thing you notice is the cute napkins, which are folded to look like a vest/dress shirt? (You'll see in the picture).  The service and food were excellent, the male and female servers both refilled our hot waters without us ever asking, and they were so courteous.  All the appetizers were great and tasted amazing. The Goat cheese with eggplant was better than I expected, grilled sardines were on point, salmon tartar looked(and tasted) great, and the shrimp bisque looked a bit plain in comparison to the others but was still good.  For the mains, the breast of capon has a little bit of heat, which was unexpected, so the person who ordered it swapped their capon with my salmon. The salmon was perfectly cooked, sea bream and skate fish were also amazing(the lemon coriander risotto under the skate fish was sooooo good)  Desserts were pretty good, for the molotof you have to eat a bit of everything on the plate or else you'll think it's too sweet(need a bit of the sour stuff on the side to balance the sugar), the creme caramel was good, ginger bread cake is good for people who like gingerbread, and the cherry tart was very decadent.  Overall, this place was amazing(can't say it enough), and I will definitely bring more friends to try. I really hope they will participate in Winterlicious, what a gem!"}
{"text":"Originally I was only gonna go here for the lunch since their dinner is the same exact menu choices, but got busy, so decided to come by for a dinner as our only 'Winterlicious' meal of 2014!   This is one of our to go list restaurant for a while and its nice to finally get to try out this place. We came in and they offered to hang up our jacket, but we declined b/c we were goose jackets and didn't want it misplaced for any reason.  Sat in a small deuce table for me and my gf. We opted for just the meal plan with a soda and coffee, so I guess the server was not too pleased with 'those type of customer' haha  My gf got the sardines and I got the grilled squid/octopus. I can tell the portions are smaller than their regular a la carte for certain but its okay to get a taster. The sardines were a nice new app we've never tried in a restaurant setting before and it tasted fine. I thought it was good. The grilled squid and octopus was fine as well. I felt the octopus tasted better but the squid was a bit more fresh.  Their service is hands-on type and they replace your cutlery for each course which is a nice touch. One funny note, after our apps, they gave us a small fork and a teaspoon, and brought our desserts! I figured that when they cleared our apps, they would notice the mains would be next, but somehow was clueless about that.  Anywho...Our mains came and my gf got the 'Duck Confit'. Giant duck leg which was meaty and filling for her. I got their skate wing fish! For those that don't know about this fish, its Stingray! Sharks favourite food and they are the sea creature with the long tail barb. The skate fish is very nice with the scales removed. The meat is very tender and easy to chew and digest. Easily better choice than some fishes out there.  Desserts we got the gingerbread cake and chocolate cherry tart. Both, I'd say were disappointing in terms of size and the taste. Imagine getting leftover end pieces of a pie. The taste was nothing special about it.  Overall this place gets a 3.5/5 score. I may come back again for this place, only b/c there are few good portuguese restaurants."}
{"text":"Do not go here for winterlicious you will be treated like a second-class citizen.  Service was poor and condescending, food was mediocre and served luke warm.  There is a very 'old country' idealism of the service staff.    We had a party of 3 for 9 pm. As soon we came in it was clear they were very busy.   The  flustered host just presumptuously said 3 for  winterlicious eh - where we replied actually can you bring both menus.   As we were hungry so we asked if an appetizer order could be placed- without even asking what I was ordering - The waiter replied ah there is a procedure for when you are ordering after the drinks and scurried off.   He came back with drinks and contemptuous asked you here for winterlicious, 3 meals? We actually were getting a mix of things and he seemed surprised.  He then asked we order everything at once. So we did   He then comes back 5 minutes later and asks if the regular appetizers should be served with the  winterlicious appetizers- as if they were diffferent worth?  On top of that the food came luke warm over cooked and we were never asked how the food was.  After paying 100$ a head for poor service and obviously made begrudgingly food I had to go to get my wallet from my jacket which I saw hanging on the coat check. The coat check/valet attendant was busy with a guest so I went to my jacket pocket to get my wallet. I was then accosted by the doorman/coat check/ valet  that \"you can't just do that, is that your jacket\" - so inappropriate and rude.   Anyway this place is a gong show and stuck on a image of itself that has changed.  Highly ill advised for winterlicious or when they are busy."}
{"text":"Céu na terra  Do yourself a HUGE favour the next time you are craving for fresh fish, impeccably served...you must head directly to Chiado.  Fresh, succulent fish is expertly prepared and presented with skill and finesse.  The preparation of the fish is so simple, authentic and uncomplicated you will be culinarily transported to the Algarve.  Chiado's fine service should not be overlooked - attentive and informed service with great attention to detail. The entire restaurant performs as a team to ensure you will love your meal.   With so many restaurants popping up and closing down in Toronto, there is a reason that Chiado has staying power.  If you like your food like you like your relationships (fabulous, simple, and uncomplicated) head over to Chiado for an amazing dinner.   They have updated/renovated their dining room - was a bit disappointed as I loved the charm and character of the old space.  Sort of like when a beautiful woman feels the need to get plastic surgery or botox to erase the lines in an effort to keep up with the hip, young crowd.  At any rate, Chiado, you are spectacular and will win every time when you compete with your food.  Até nos encontrarmos novamente"}
{"text":"Ambiance was great. If you're looking for a private room with a beautiful theme for a small party (we were a group of 10), this is an excellent option! I heard mixed reviews of the food across the table. The birthday girl had grilled octopus for her entree and really loved it. The trio was also a good option for those who can't make up their minds on which fresh fish to pick!  The overall experience was good. Our server waited until everyone had arrived and brought out the daily specials (literally fresh fish arranged beautifully on a chopping board). He walked the guests through it and then gave us some time to make our orders. A few of us ordered wine. I ordered a port (dry white) & tonic. I loved that they had it here. It's difficult to find a restaurant that offers dry white port and they had both Taylor's Chip Dry AND Fonseca!.   I had the vegetable risotto, which didn't taste or look like the usual Italian risotto. Which I expect to be normal, since we were clearly at a Portuguese restaurant! It was interesting to try something a little different. There are limited options for vegetarians, but that's expected. This is a fresh fish kind of restaurant, so it's great for fish lovers.  In any case, the service was good overall. Towards the end, it was a little questionable. Given that our group had not mentioned up front that the bill would be separate, we calculated our own amounts to pay, but I think the restaurant was closing up and we were the last ones there. It felt a bit like they wanted us out of there.   I could see myself coming back for some good Portuguese wine or a port & tonic."}
{"text":"Just had my office Christmas dinner at Chiado. The personalized menu was a perfect touch. The food was superb, everything was delicious and just the right portion. Our dinner was held in the cellar and what a unique and perfect spot. Our waiter was impeccable and very attentive. I definitely plan to return here and have some more yummy food. Thank you for the amazing hospitality."}
{"text":"4/5! Highly recommend this place. We shared the grilled squid, lobster, octopus and goat cheese appetizers! All of the dishes were fantastic--cooked and seasoned perfectly. This is the sister restaurant of Salt Wine Bar and both venues have great service and friendly management. We will definitely go back to try the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"My sis and I were making a trip to little portugal one day and made it our goal to find the best portuguese restaurant,  with the best grilled octopus.   We found this place on blogTO and decided that this would be the place with the best octopus. Im not a big fan of octopus despite liking every other type of seafood there is, but after seeing pictures I knew theres no way I wouldn't like it .  We came in on a weekday for lunch and the place was empty besides having one other customer. Which means we got THe BEST service.  We ordered the lobster bisque, toasted goat cheese, and grilled octopus to share, and also got some really tasty cheese appetizers on the house. The bread and olive oil they give you is also delicious.  My sister couldn't help but eat it despite following a gluten-free diet, and she also bought some of their olive oil to go. Its that good!!  All of the dishes were extremely good, and Im sure the staff made the octopus portion for two people because there were two big tentacles on top of plenty of grilled veggies. We couldve gotten full off just that.  It was very pleasant !    Before we left we decided to ask the staff where we can get the best portuguese custard tarts in the city and we were recommended Caldense bakery. They really did have amazing custard tarts and other desserts and we kept coming back there. Thanks for the suggestion!!   I loved this place because the food was delicious, the service and ambience was of a fine dining place, the prices were moderate, and youd be paying twice the amount at any other place in my opinion"}
{"text":"My all time fav. This is my go to choice for small get togethers with friends or to blow away a visiting work colleague.  I have been coming here for over 15 years.  Absolutely fantastic service. I have never had a bad dish. I have never had an average dish. Consistently fantastic is hard to achieve.  And .... I love the Portuguese wines. There are great reasonably priced wines and great pricey wines. Whatever suits your mood."}
{"text":"Try the daily fresh fish, they are happy to debone and remove the head for softies like me! Grilled squid app was plentiful & goat cheese eggplant app was warm, delicate and flavourful. Staff were appropriately attentive and not intrusive."}
{"text":"Fine, but not dying to return. ______________________________________________________________  Decent quality food, but some of the flavours/tastes could have been better adjusted (ie. if not spot on, it was too sour, too sweet, or slightly bland). Also, portions are a bit small - I wasn't completely satisfied after the meal.  Staff was a bit uptight. We were waiting for a friend to arrive before ordering, and a worker reminded me that he had seating to manage... got the message and ordered shortly after. I can understand where he's coming from, but I didn't like feeling rushed.  Space is more comfortable than I imagined from the pictures online. ______________________________________________________________   From the 25$, summerlicious lunch prix fix, I picked:  shrimp bisque, saffron, cognac Filet of Seabream \"Dourada\" with a warm salad of green beans  Molotof  - Complimentary bread and black pitted olives with garlic on the table :)    They forgot to put oil in my dipping dish, so I asked for some from a waiter who seemed unimpressed that I was not served earlier.  I wondered if balsamic vinegar was available too, but I didn't want to be greedy and ask for it.    - The bisque tasted more watered down than rich, therefore slightly bland in my opinion. The 2 small, salted shrimp in the bisque were essential.  - The Dourada was perfectly seasoned and cooked! I was happy that it tasted fresh - not frozen and then defrosted. The strawberry sauce on top was different - too sour for my liking. Green beans were crisp and well done; I wish there were more than the thin layer hidden under the fillet.   - The molotof was light and airy, but the sweetness was a bit overpowering, especially with the very sugary mini meringue. The sour rhubarb side helped offset the sugar, to an extent."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to hear about your other restaurant closing, I had an opportunity to try your restaurant and I did find it difficult to understand your staff, the bald man not wearing an apron was very pleasant but he seemed to be a little slow, the dish I had was extremely salty.  The wine choice was very pricey, I saw one wine I recognized on the menu for $60 and I saw it in the liquor store for $8.95.  I wish restaurants would operate with integrity and appreciate their customers and not try to rob them while dining out. I give this restaurant 1 out of 5 for blatantly trying to rob from their so called guests.    Shame on you Chiado.   I wish you luck but I predict a downward shift in business and I predict by March you will have reached your lowest point in business and might need to resort to another low point of groupon or coupon cutting."}
{"text":"I came here for the lunch Summerlicious menu. I had the grilled sardines, skate fish on lemon thyme risotto and ginger cake with vanilla for dessert. The sardines were good but the main and dessert were amazing. Excellent service. Definitely a place to revisit"}
{"text":"While high priced I have consistently found this to be the best seafood restaurant I have eaten at and always try to return to it when back in TO. Went again last night and again everything was excellent! Sardine appetizer and then black cod with a porcini paste and red wine reduction sauce. My daughters had the skate with risotto while my other daughter had another fish from Portugal and both were excellent! Excellent Portuguese wines available by the glass."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere were good but terrible service. Definitely not what you'd expect at this kind of establishment, and quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday evening, was relatively quiet.  What's great is how uncool it is, don't expect to hear acid Jazz in the background, this place is classy and unpretentious, no pencil pants anywhere to be seen, no attitude.   The fresh fish was showcased to us, apparently most or all of it is flown in from Portugal.  For appetizers my wife and I opted for grilled squid with fresh coriander, lemon, garlic, olive oil which is served with roasted sweet peppers, charred tomato and caramlized leeks.  Yum!  Next came the steamed clams in a broth of garlic, coriander, white wine and olive oil.    My wife chose a whole fish, similar to a snapper although more robust in flavour, can't remember the name.  It was very good, but not as good as my grilled octopus.  Simply put, the best I've had.  It paired perfectly with a roasted sweet pepper salsa.    With a bottle of white Esparao, the meal was a memorable one."}
{"text":"It's 3/5 stars because it's too expensive for the quality of the food. Don't get me wrong, this place is not bad. The food is quite delicious but I've been to better Portuguese restaurants that are cheaper than this place. My bf who is Portuguese commented that it's not really Portuguese food. If not for Groupon, I probably won't even dare to set foot in here."}
{"text":"The Yelp page for Chiado claims that the restaurant is wheelchair accessible which it is laughably not. Do not come to this establishment if you have accessibility needs."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant.  My husband and I go there for lunch on occasion - not as often as would like due to our crazy schedules.  I had the Winterlicious menu but my husband ordered off the regular menu - everything was so delicious.  My husband had the grilled sardines, roasted salted cod and berries for dessert.  I had the salmon tartar, the cod terrine and the pecan tart for dessert.  They bring you bread with olive oil and black cured olives right at the beginning of the meal.  We both loved everything.  The salmon tartar had a slight citrus flavour and was served with an avocado mouse.  The portion was small, light and refreshing - very clean flavours.  The cod terrine was similar to a sheppard's pie except it was made with salted cod in the base of it and topped with whipped potatoes.  It had a wine flavoured gravy on the bottom of the plate.  The pecan tart was delicious.  I tasted my husband's grilled salted cod and it was so fresh and delicious.    Really this is our favourite seafood restaurant.  The service is wonderful as well, they are very attentive and constantly refill water glasses etc. but are not intrusive in any way.  I can't say enough about how much we love this restaurant."}
{"text":"I visited Chiado for the first time for summerlicious and it was a very delightful experience! It was my first time trying Portuguese cuisine and everything was great.   Think Chiado has 6 options to choose from for each course, the variety which is quite nice to see, as most restaurants limit the options to 3 usually.   Salmon tartare for appetizer was very light and refreshing. The salmon tartare was a bit lemon-y but I think that's why I enjoyed it. Wouldn't have been the same without the slight sweep of tanginess. Shrimp bisque was also nice- heavier than I expected, but still smooth and rich.   For the main course we ordered mushroom risotto and skatefish with lemon risotto, and both of them were very nice. I quite enjoyed the mushroom risotto, as it's hard to find a delicious risotto dish that is cooked right with such limited ingredients. Very smooth, soft, and tasty without being salty!   Desserts were my favorite part. Ordered ginger cake and white chocolate creme caramel, and they were desserts done right. Not too light yet not too heavy - You know, sometimes the dessert dishes are too overpowering that they overwhelm your palate and leaves you nothing but the taste of sugar and creme- nothing like that!  Both of the dessert dishes gave me a good solid sweetness but not too strong. Loved the subtle ginger taste!  Another absolute favorite was the dried olives that came with the bread at the beginning of the meal. Not your wet, salty ordinary olives! Full of flavors yet not too salty.   Overall, Chiado was a very delightful experience. I would love to come back to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. The interior is decorated very stylistically. The lighting is neither too bright nor too dim. It is quite easy to notice that the owner is very detail oriented.  Servers at Chiado are all very courteous and attentive. I was really impressed by their coat check at the door because I am one of those people who do not like to carry my coat around and hang it behind my chair.    The food portion is rather small but surprisingly filling. I was very full at the end of the meal. My favourite dish is absolutely the eggplant stuffed with goat cheese. If I haven't had this dish at Chiado, I would never expect eggplants to be such a good match for goat cheese. The flavour this dish is very rich and unique."}
{"text":"One of the best winterlicious I tried thus far. I never really like winterlicious menu, usually it's pretty mediocre. It is in the higher price range of Winterlicious at $45. I had sardines as starter and black cod as main. The cod was very tender and nicely flavored. I really enjoy my meal. However, one of my friends had lobster bisque as starter, and he thought it was bland. And, he had squid as a main, which he thought was the size of a starter.  :/ everyone's a critic.  I thought the service was great too."}
{"text":"Like many other reviewers, I tried Chiado as part of the Summerlicious promotion going on right now. It had been on my radar for the past few years but I only had the opportunity to go this round, and I was not disappointed.   To start, there were marinated olives (not really my thing, but others liked it), fresh bread, and olive oil. I had the salmon tartare, which was vaguely reminiscent of a ceviche mixed with apple on some chopped avocado. The grilled squid was perfectly cooked, although the vegetables underneath were a little greasy and under-seasoned by my standpoint. No matter - the sea salt at the table did the trick. The molotof for dessert was very light and very sweet - it was like a meringue with the lightness of cotton candy and the texture of sponge cake. Delicious with coffee.  The service was quick and attentive, and I was very pleased with the lunch. It's definitely on the list next time I'm in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Still a fan of this place and had quite a good meal, but had to do a server switch-a-roo to ensure that. I've been to Chiado many times and delight in the server coming over to describe the fresh fish offered that evening, the way it is prepared and its accompanying sides.   The guy we first had just pointed to the fish and named them...I was trying to show off this restaurant so when I grilled him for more fish detail, he was clueless \"oh they are served with starch and vegetables...the chef chooses day to day\"...well we want to know today! So I quietly called over the guy who seems to run the show, he suggested two dishes, gave us half portions of two of the fresh fish with half portions of their sides, too. It was great. The experience was saved. Chiado, I like you - but make sure all your staff are up to par...because eating with you isn't exactly cheap."}
{"text":"Definitely \"old school\" ambiance. If you food that lets the freshness of the ingredients shine through, this is the place for you.  If you're looking for a \"hip vibe\" or to be seen at the latest \"hot spot\" this isn't it.  Great wine and food, good service and no pretension made for a great evening and was, in my books, worth every penny."}
{"text":"Their olive oil is TO DIE FOR. I salivate just thinking about it. Their grilled squid served at dinner time as an appie is also to die for. I remember that taste so vividly and crave it every now and then. Their capon dish was DELICIOUS and I highly highly recommend it along with their shrimp and lobster bisque. Their fish was ok, just wanted to try something different but I found that it lacked flavor.Their service is AMAZING and better than other high end restaurants eg canoe and scarpetta and I feel like the waiters love their jobs and want us to genuinely enjoy ourselves. The ambience is also very nice, it's like you've been transported to another world."}
{"text":"I have been to Chiado twice for dinner in the past month; once on the regular menu and once for the Summerlicious menu. In addition, I have been to Chiado's a few other times for dinners and lunches over the last several years.   To get right to the bottom line: Chiado's is pretentious and a little full of itself. The food is good, with very fresh and not  overdone fish, but not superb. The price, however, is what you would expect to pay for something extraordinary, rather than a dinner which is reliable and good, but nothing at all surprising. Staying on the food theme - they tend to be a little too heavy on the salt shaker, although a lot of salt is admittedly a feature of Portuguese cooking. Veggies are done quite well, crisp and flavourful. Bread basket is mediocre at best. Desserts are not worth the calories.  On the service side: I have gone for dinner with a wealthy friend who frequents Chiado's and the service was excellent and friendly. I went recently on the Summerlicious menu and I was surprised that they deigned to serve us at all. First, they messed up the reservation (they phoned me back to confirm but there was no record of a reservation). They seated us anyway but seemed to have trouble recalling that we were there. The waiter forgot one of the four appetizers and then forgot to bring desserts. The waiter was unhelpful in the wine choice (it is all Portuguese wine and despite one of our party being the owner of a high end winery and extremely knowledgeable he, as would few of us, does not know Portuguese wines). I assume the waiter felt we could not afford a good enough bottle for him to waste time recommending the wine.   So while Chiado does a good, solid job with its main feature, fish, it needs to treat ALL of its customers as welcome, rather than doing you a favour by allowing you to eat there. They charge premium prices but have not mastered the art of offering a premium dining experience."}
{"text":"I would have to say this restaurant wins hands down when it comes to seafood! Absolutely delightful and memorable! Worth every penny. Decor is traditional but not dated. Very classy. Perfect for a romantic evening out."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went for our anniversary and we definitely give this place a 4* every bite was heavenly. Service was also amazing."}
{"text":"Went for the winterlicious last night ($45/per person) and was not disappointed! This restaurant is small but very cozy.  After we sat down, the waiter greeted us right away. He gave us bread, olive oil to go with the bread and some very delicious black olives!   For the starter I had the salmon tartar with avocado mousse. It was very good!  For the main course, I chose the sea scallops risotto. As per previous reviews, some yelpers said they only got 2 scallops but we got 3 big ones. The risotto was really creamy and delicious as well. Overall, the seafood was very fresh and I thought the portion size was perfect. For the dessert, i had the ginger bread cake which was also really good.   Overall I was very satisfied with the meal and service. Would definitely come back for the regular menu!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in the city.  I'm generally not blown away with the seafood options in the city but Chiado was an major exception.  The scallops, monkfish and lobster & shrimp soup were outstanding dishes.  Cooked perfectly with fresh, authentic, mouthwatering flavours.  The steak and frites really hit the spot.  The thought of that port sauce makes my mouth water.   You can tell that they use only the best ingredients and do all their entries very well.  Classy decor and friendly service complements their great food.  Reminds me very much of Ferreira Cafe in Montreal.  I'm a big fan on this place.  This is where I want to come back for my birthday!"}
{"text":"From the summerlicous menu:   Cod fish cakes (can't remember the exact name of the dish): they were unimpressive and tasted like a mix between a potato croquette and a fish stick.  Salmon ceviche: I've had lots of ceviche in the past, from many countries, so I have a point of reference. Ceviche is supposed to be marinated in lemon (or something else with high acidity) together with veggie bits (like onions and whatnot), and seasoning. Chiado's \"ceviche\" was merely chopped bits of raw salmon. The veggies were not incorporated, and the salmon was not marinated. Probably should NOT call it a ceviche. I wouldn't even call it a deconstructed ceviche, nor an interpretation. It had no identifying characteristics of ceviche.  Dourada (sea bream): Blackened white fish. It was alright. nothing impressive.  Skate fish: This was the better dish of everything we tried. However, the risotto was watery.  Ginger cake: no thanks  Chocolate cherry tart: meh.  Veredict: would not come back"}
{"text":"The food is OK. Really not impressive. Worst given the price. The ambiance is good and service is great. Since we cook bacalhau really well with a great family recipe, I'll skip this one in the future."}
{"text":"Had great expectations for this restaurant. In short, the food was excellent! I had chicken which was perfect. My daughter and wife both had cod. Superior. Appetizers were soup of the day, (root vegetable,) shrimp/lobster bisque and sardines. Desert was also well prepared. So, what was the problem? Well, for a three course meal, it took over two hours. Not that horrible, but the main came late. The waiter apologized for the delay. I can accept that. At desert, we ordered coffees which came immediately. I kept sipping slowly until finally, I asked if the deserts were forgotten. The reply was, no sir, they will be ready shortly. These were probably pre-prepared, and appeared seconds later, as he went to the kitchen, returning with desert. A coffee refill would have been nice at this time. No one asked how the food was, and lastly, my daughter's plates for the main, were removed from the opposite side of the table. I wasn't spilled on or anything like that, but I believe this place, considering the ambiance, etc, is feeling that they are fine dining. They could be, but they are not. Sorry."}
{"text":"Went there for 2015 summerlicious dinner ($45)  Location/Environment: Went there on a Sunday, surprisingly not too many people.  Street parking is available (but carpool would be best to avoid issues).  There's a lot of artwork inside the restaurant (I'm not too much into art, but they all look very nice).  We sat at the corner by the window, which was perfect since it was a group of 5.  Service: Our waiter was fantastic - he was funny, friendly and really made the dinner enjoyable.  He recommended us a Portuguese white wine called Pinho Real.  It's very good - light, sweet and only exclusive to their restaurant.  The restaurant is a little bit upscale - so there were more staff available and serving you and they were all nice as well.  Food: Appetizer - Goat Cheese, eggplant, portabella mushrooms, champagne vinaigrette Surprisingly good.  I loved how you can distinctively taste all the flavours, and it doesn't clash with each other.  Note the goat cheese is a little strong for those who aren't into cheese that much.  But I really liked the mushroom - very soft and easy to eat.   Main - Pan Seared Skate Fish on lemon coriander risotto I'm not a fan of risotto - but it had skate fish, so I had to try.  The skate fish was grilled very nicely on the outside; it has a grilled chicken taste to it. The meat inside was perfect - soft, not dry, boneless. I really enjoyed it.  The risotto was not bad too.  It was a good combination with the fish.  Dessert - Molotof, flan of eggwhies, crème anglaise This is a Portuguese dessert, which is fluffy whipped egg whites.  It was not bad first time trying it.  There was a lot of honey/syrup around the molotof, which made it very sweet - a little too sweet for my tasting.  Overall it was a very nice dinner.  A bottle of wine, good food, friends and chatting it up with the waiter really made it an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"The service is excellent, with food to match. IF you are a fresh fish fan, you must try this place out."}
{"text":"Our third visit here in 4 or 5 years and it didn't disappoint. Fabulous service and well-informed waiter. We had black cod, a Portuguese fish whose name I can't recall, loin of monkfish and Atlantic Salmon. They were all superbly cooked, deliciously spiced and beautifully presented. We were too well fed to try dessert. But oh my, the cost is just too high. For 4 of us and one bottle of wine, one drink, 4 appetizers and the mains it was $400 before the tip. It was a reminder why we don't hike across the city for a meal there more than once every few years - and to be honest there are comparable places in our great city at a lower price point. Too bad..."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Review  Came here for lunch, and was VERY pleased with the food.   Ordered: -Sardine appetizer: came with peppers and grilled onions. The combination was delicious, and the sardines were cooked well -Skate fish & risotto: it was my first time having skate fish. It was great, so I kind of regret waiting this long. The risotto was good too. Again really liked the combination  -White chocolate creme brulee: this was my least favorite of the 3. If I had skipped the dessert, I  probably would have given this place 5  stars   Also, tried the wife's squid dish. It was cooked perfectly... maybe the best squid that I've had. Her dessert wasn't that great either though.   I will be back to try the regular menu."}
{"text":"Overpriced peasant food, bairrada down the street offers the same food at 1/3 the price and similar service.   The space beside chiado is always empty, is it open for business, I heard they were not, can anybody tell me if they still accept groupon?"}
{"text":"I came for the summerlicious menu. I personally had the grilled sardines as a starter, salmon as a main, and the cherry tart for desert. The food obviously came in small portions for summerlicious. I cannot comment how the portion size is for regular Dining. However, I was happily satisfied. The food was fresh, well prepared, and delicious. The salmon was perfectly cooked. The desert was wonderful and all the food was presented very well. The restaurant was clean and comfortable with white clean table linens and plates. The only suggestion I would have is to offer stainless steel cutlery. I am allergic to silver which is all they had, but the waitress was able to ask around in the kitchen and managed to find a spoon for me that I used throughout. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The washrooms were on the lower level and clean. Overall I thought it was a lovely experience with good food. There were four of us altogether. Everyone ordered something different and we all enjoyed our food very much."}
{"text":"Just went for winterlicious. Service was good.  food was delicious. I enjoyed the grilled squid. 2 things:  1.portion was too small. I ordered sea scallop rissoto. The dish came with 2 scallop and a tiny layer of rissoto. It almost looked funny.i know this is winterlicious but thus is still not reasonable.  My friends ordered other main dish that came with reasonable portions. 2.the lobster bisque was bland and not flavourful. There was a shirmp in it which made the soup tasted weird. It tasted more like a shirmp soup.  Desert was OK. Not bad but nothing exciting.  The chocolate cherry tart was too hard. Overall I am disappointed. Not eager to return."}
{"text":"Even winterlicious is well prepared and services were good. But the desserts were the wrong one. Need to try out the Motolof next time!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. A bit on the pricey side but that's to be expected considering what you're getting and the presentation. Absolutely recommend for a special occasion or romantic night out."}
{"text":"I came here with three other friends for summerlicious and overall my experience was great. The food was quite flavourful and the servers were friends and very polite. Although, I'm not too sure if the portion of the three course meal was worth $70. All in all the atmosphere is friendly, the environment is clean and it seems as if many of the customers and waiters are quite familiar with each other."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for Winterlicious this past Saturday. Despite the fact that somehow the online booking system malfunctioned and we DIDN'T have our proper reservation time of 1pm (I called ahead of time to confirm my worst fears), they graciously accepted us after pushing our time a little later.  The people on the phone were curt but helpful, and as I'm usually very prompt with reservations, I was really upset to find out they couldn't find our names on the list. That being said, booking for Winterlicious was crazy and I probably should have called.  When we came in on the first Winterlicious Saturday for lunch, it was busy. Very busy. Winterlicious busy and gross outside, so probably with walk-ins as well. That being said, we waited maybe 10-15 min for a table with no reservation (\"Just come in, don't worry\") and were seated much quicker than I was expecting. The waiter was quick, kind, and knowledgeable and after looking at the Winterlicious menu for well over a week, I knew exactly what I wanted.  We were given yummy, fresh bread to start with the most wonderful olives I've ever tasted. I am usually put off by how salty olives are but these were soft and doused in the yummiest olive oil (with some on the side as well), that I've tried in a while. It's possible we dipped the entire bread basket over the course of the meal.  We ordered the grilled sardine and the grilled octopus/calamari to start. It's unfortunate we shared because while the sardine was great, the calamari was unbelievable.   \"So THAT'S what it's supposed to taste like..\" I said.  We also ordered some wine - a suggested glass of red and white (though the names escape it) - very good stuff and cheaper for Winterlicious ($9 and $8) than the stuff on their regular menu.   For the main, I had the salmon and my boy had Tile fish - and since he's a salmon lover I was surprised when he said he loved his much more than mine. That being said, I was thrilled with my dish and the plum chutney, beets, and small salad underneath. The fish was great.   The dessert was okay - we got some sort of chocolate/strawberry cake - but the highlight was my boyfriend's Americano, which was so good he said he hasn't had anything quite like it since we came back from Europe.   The waiter made a mistake on our check, charging us for the dinner, but was so quick to fix it when we pointed it out that it was unbelievable. The service is absolutely incredible. We would go back just for that. He offered to have a new coffee made for my boyfriend since he was still finishing his wine and \"it might have cooled\".   It's kind of nice being treated like royalty, and the dishes literally coming out within a minute of you finishing the current dish. Timed like magic. Never experienced before, nothing will live up to this again."}
{"text":"I went here for summerlicoius since the review of this restaurant is really good. However, I was not too impressed. Restaurant is nice with great service. However food is just a OK.  Appetizer:   Goat cheese, eggplant with mushroom - The combination was nice however it was sweet. So it was not my cup of tea. Salmon Tatar - Not a bad dish, but not so impressive. Portion is small  Main:  Skate fish with risotto - The fish was cooked beautifully. However, it tasted so spicy. It has too much spices and black pepper, so you couldnot ever taste the freshness of the fish. Grilled squid - Squid was nicely grilled. However, it was salty. Garnish was poor so that there was no other flavor in the plate other than just the squid.   Dessert: Desserts are not too bad but portion was quite small.  I guess pros is that they have excellent sparking water from Portugal. Both me and my bf love that so much.  They has a great selection and tasty in house bread. And the quality of the Oliver Oil that goes with the bread was very good!   I really hope they could improve the seasoning of the fish."}
{"text":"Late review for summerlicious.  Went to Chiado's for dinner and upon entering I noticed the old-fashioned interior that others have already mentioned. The service was attentive and great but the kitchen may be on the slower side. I think our group meal took around 3 hours because we waited quite long for each dish. I personally did't mind, but I know some people don't really enjoy waiting for their food.   I ordered the calamari, salmon fillet with chutney, and the molotov. The seafood was grilled and seasoned well but I found the flavours to be a bit uninspiring. However, I would say their food and restaurant style is very classical. Very safe. The dessert was on the sweeter side, even for a meringue.   Good place if you prefer classic flavour profiles and want to spend a nice quiet evening!"}
{"text":"First time there, beautiful ambience, a bit pricy, portion size adequate, appetizers are innovative and delicious. Goat cheese and grilled tiger shrimps were amazing as were clams and Atlantic salmon. They can easily accommodate big groups even on weekends. Great seafood to try to."}
{"text":"I was here with my grandma and sister for summerlicious 2015.  The food and service was spectacular.  The restaurant had a fine dining feel to it and the food reflects that.  The portions were great and it was worth every penny.  We would def come back to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious after hearing good reviews about it, but I was quite disappointed.   Upon arrival, we had our coats taken for us so that was a nice touch. The restaurant is pretty dark and a bit loud (since the tables are rather close together) so it was a bit difficult to have a private conversation.   We ordered the lobster/shrimp bisque and the sardines to start. Both dishes came quickly and were good - nothing spectacular but pretty yummy.   45 minutes later we still hadn't received our mains. After more waiting and asking the waiters to check on the food, it turns out they had incorrectly delivered our food to another table. Instead of realizing they delivered our food to another table, they thought the order for the other table was recorded wrong. So when our food was delivered, it was wrong again. If we had never asked, we would've never gotten our food, since in their system, they had already delivered it.   After this entire fiasco, I would've thought we'd get more than a barely-there apology, but nope, that's all we got. As if it wasn't a big deal.   I thought the food was good (not sure if worth the price tag), but the whole experience was definitely not one to remember for my good books."}
{"text":"This was perhaps the best dinner I have experienced.  It is expensive. I felt a bit uncomfortable in my jeans and sweatshirt, but it was COLD outside, okay? (January, negative 15, snowing, wind chill. You know... Toronto.) And I didn't realize how upscale this place was. However, the staff never batted an eye about it, and graciously seated our chilled party of three.   The place was not busy when we went, but perhaps that was because it was such horrible weather outside. The staff was attentive, friendly, and helpful.   We immediately were served complimentary bread, with olive oil to accompany it. The olive oil was delicious. The different kinds of bread were delicious. (One a thin, crunchy toast, one a wheat bread, and the last a corn bread.) I couldn't stop eating it despite wanting to save room for what I knew would be coming.  We received a complimentary dish of fresh cheese, with honey and balsamic reduction. It was a lovely start. Very fresh. I could've eaten that all day. Yum!   Our table shared an appetizer of raw, lightly marinated grouper with white asparagus. This was DIVINE. The pairing of flavours was fresh, harmonious, and unexpected. Again: that was something I could happily eat all day long. Wow.   (I kept eating the bread with olive oil throughout all of this, and simply could not find the force of will to stop. It was so delicious. When I was done with the bread--I tried to be inconspicuous about it, I promise--I drank my remaining olive oil. If you tasted it, you would forgive me, I think.)   I ordered the salted cod main course. My partner ordered the skate. The third of our table ordered the tilefish, which was one of the special fish dishes of the day. We shared to compare notes. All were amazing, we agreed, but the skate took the prize.   The salted cod is a traditional Portuguese dish, I was informed. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and all of the components were phenomenally prepared, thought out, and cooked. I  am not sure about all of the ingredients, but I think there was beet, some almonds (I think), potato, kale, and asparagus.  We ordered a $70 bottle of white wine. I cannot remember what it was. I'm not a wine person--sorry--but this wine was very drinkable.   The tawny 30-year-old port wine was incredible. It smelled so strongly like maple syrup and a bunch of other heavenly, complex things and it delivered all of that and more in the taste.    To summarize, I hope I will come back and taste everything they make! Whoever is behind all of this deliciousness is a culinary genius. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal at Chiado recently. Service was extremely attentive without being overbearing. Started off with a selection of appetizers including the sardines which were an unexpected treat. For my main I had a cataplana which I remembered from a visit to Portugal. It is not on the menu but the chef agreed to make it. (thanks to earlier poster Jeff C. for suggesting it)  My dinner companion enjoyed the dry soup. We finished it off the meal and our second bottle of wine with a cheese plate. Excellent dinner!"}
{"text":"I recently had the Summerlicious lunch here and it was amazing from the attentive service to the fresh seafood.   For the appetizer, I had the goat cheese with eggplant and portobello mushroom. The dish was a great balance with melted goat cheese and acidity from the tomato.  For entree, I had the skate fish with lemon risotto. The fish was very meaty and flavourful. It was like the pulled pork of the sea. The fish was fresh. The lemon from the risotto really lightens the palette.  The final dessert was Molotov which is an egg white meringue sided with some strawberries. It was a bit on the sweet side but the presentation was beautiful with a molasses art piece."}
{"text":"Well I've been here before years ago but I don't recall much except that the food was good. very fresh seafood is on the menu.  I had a mastercard special menu which had an first, second & third and then dessert and dessert wine for $50. Unbelievable price really.  I agree with reviewers food is great, service decent but not the best I've had. I also think the servers profile you ahead of time lol as to whether you're worth spending extra time on.  I'd go back for the seafood bottom line. We started with fresh cheese with balsamic vinegar & oregano oil, second we had grilled octopus and grilled sardines, main we both had grilled fish and dessert: one was a meringue dessert, looks  huge which it was! With bits of sponge toffee in it for crunchy contrast (that was quite nice) the other was light too with a creme anglais type topping. Both were delicious. The dessert wine was a moscato, very smooth and the fish was perfectly cooked and fresh! And I'm picky about fish!  If I can taste anything, anything that isn't just fish, I won't eat it. Especially if it's from a fancy place like this one.  They asked if we needed them to cut the fish for us lol but we are both Asian and know how to eat a whole fish lol.  My friend eats the fish heads for crying out loud!! The squid was perfect not chewy, the sardines also nice but I preferred the squid. Sardines came with a marinated chopped tomato but I didn't find it enhanced the sardines much.  Overall a very pleasant evening out. I also agree tables are close and it's loud in there. My voice wasn't happy by the end of the meal. But I know, they gotta make ends meet and it sure ain't happening by volume!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 8 last night to try out Chiado's Winterlicious menu.  I've been to Chiado before -  in fact, my friends and I have rented out this restaurant in the past for law firm or other events.   Our service was, regrettably, completely sub-par.  The waiter was needlessly aggressive (attitude, cocky - and overtly so).  Members of our party came at separate times and each, without being prompted, noticed this immediately.  It, unfortunately, coloured what was an otherwise happy occasion.    Food was fine (as usual) but one has to wonder whether they treat guests differently if paying on a Winterlicious menu vs buying out the restaurant for a law firm event.  I certainly feel this way.  Forewarned is forearmed."}
{"text":"I had a great meal here. The grilled calamari appetizer was excellent and the cod main (a special addition to the menu that day) was, if anything, even better. One of my dining companions had the octopus, and that's certainly on my agenda for the next time. We had some terrific Portugese red wine as well. The staff was friendly, knowledgable and had the perfect level of attentiveness."}
{"text":"Was here for summerlicious and really enjoyed the food! The grilled squid appetizer was delicious; crisp and tender in texture and very well seasoned. The fresh cod main course was cooked perfectly and melt in your mouth. Definitely worth visiting again."}
{"text":"Will I go again? Nope. Wish I'd taken advantage of the Summerliciois menu so I wouldn't be out $100 from my pocket.  Order: lobster octopus salad: mayo much? Black scabbered (white fish with black speckles- I probably ordered it for the weird factor) with saffron pea risotto- seriously making rice yellow is not the art of risotto. Appropriately creamy, but totally tasteless like the fish. Chocolate mousse- too decadent, nearly cake like.   Loved the ambience, white linens, attentiveness.   But if I wanted a memorable Portuguese fresh seafood dinner, this was not the place."}
{"text":"It's an oldie but a goodie. Perhaps a bit stuffy and not as trendy, but when you have great service and delicious food, the other stuff doesn't matter as much unless you have to be \"seen\".  The service here is very welcoming and the amazing olives are great. Wine list has some unique Portuguese selections.   The fresh fish, whole and grilled,  you just can't miss and the octopus is also a treat."}
{"text":"Used the Groupon for the Tasting Menu tonight and have to say I was very disappointed with the event. To start off the host is incredibly full of himself, overly brisk, with the feeling that you should understand you are lucky to be in his restaurant. The tasting menu is definitely a tasting menu, a small taste of a few things. The rooms are lovely, the design excellent, the service staff very efficient. A very large investment has been made in far out dishware, too bad the same can't be said for the food. The serving plates were piping hot, sadly not hot enough to heat up the food. The cheese course was a joke, reminiscent of those cardboard circular cheese boxes with a dozen triangles of tasteless cheese, along with two tiny smears of soemthing that may have tasted good if there was enough to taste. The lobster bisque tasted oddly sour for some reason. The main: Tyle Fish could have come from Captain Highliner, the sauce was so incredibly spicy there was no tasting of the fish. Lukewarm mashed potatoes (they cool of quickly when there is only a teaspoon of them, could have come from a box of powder. The dessert sampler was merely amusing. The biggest item on the menu was pretension, definitely more than I needed.  To finish off the evening we were presented with a menu card that ordered us to pay a $25.00 tip! Nothing less, nothing more.   When a restaurant starts off by acknowledging that they have rough rubes as customers and need to be instructed on tipping, they lost me.  Groupons and Winterlicious should be mediums to bring in new customers to become regular customers, not to drive them away after one evening.   I am rethinking my whole interest in Groupons and such.  Tell me I am getting a hundred dollar meal for a discount, and then give me a discount meal with an inflated tip and I am soooo outtta there!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I've never had a bad experience or a bad meal!   Guarenteed amazing meal and experience!  We usually get the Black Scabbard Fish or Tuna Steak which I highly recommend both.  I love Chiado and I'll always be back!"}
{"text":"This is real (Portuguese) Mommy's cuisine in the heart of Toronto! Go for the grilled squid appetiser and follow with a traditional \"açorda de marisco\". You could not find any better at Mommy's!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for various licious an non-licious days. Chiado is a fine establishment that has endure the test of time though it's really one of those easily forgettable places. I would label their style as classical and I think it's a good thing because I am a classic man =P It's great to visit a place like this where the focus is solely on the food and not Instagram-mability. I think we are at a cross point today where there is too much emphasis on eating with are eyes over our senses. Too often do I see people glorifying every single edible thing they can get their hands on via social media. Anyhow, that is another discussion for another day.  Chiado just does it right. The ingredients are fresh, simple and cooked perfectly. Everything tastes delicious and you will leave knowing that you've had a great meal even though it may not leave a lasting impression. Their specialty is of the seafood variety and they know how to cook it well. Every fish variety is tender and juicy while there is a delicate balance of those subtle seafood flavours and added spices. I truly believe the best seafood preparations are minimalistic; seafood should taste delicate and refine. It's one of those foods where the less is more approach really holds true. I applaud these guys for staying true to their roots of classic  preparations just like how they do it overseas (during my last visit to Portugal).  I can attest that on several visits that services is on point. There's no 5 star service here but they are always courteous, polite and accommodating. I will be back again soon, if this place ever comes to mind. LOL  Highly recommended if you're a classic man/lady."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a sophisticated Portuguese restaurant this is a great option. Their wine selection is fantastic and the fresh fish selection is amazing. I had the octopus and it was perfectly cooked. The sardines are also a great choice for starters. I think I'm coming back on the next special occasion."}
{"text":"Spectacular attentive service. High quality and fresh ingredients. Neighborhood was not particularly appealing. Interior decor was comfortable. Very detail oriented staff, and food well garnished and plated. Fine dining establishment that's cozy and comfortable to settle into.   The food was 3.5 but the impeccable service kicked it to a 4 star rating. Food was fresh, large serving sizes which I found surprising given it's a fine dining venue. Appetizers can be quite pricey. Easily a $350 bill for four without wine. Server knew their dishes inside and out. Provided detailed explanations, though recommendations or portion size control suggestions were lacking. The plating and overall appearance was pleasant though not artistically intricate. Appetizers were phenomenal, delightfully flavorful, and extremely fresh. Mains I found a little on the bland side. Assuming it was to bring out the natural tastes of the jewels of the sea, but candidly speaking, did find the texture and overall dish a little rough on the edges.   Would go again but would prefer just a wine and appetizers outing instead."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Chiado and the experience was even better this time. If you enjoy fish, this is a great place to come for a good variety, served fresh, cooked to perfection and presented with simplicity and elegance. After being seated by the gracious staff, we were given a bowl of black olives and some crusty bread with virgin olive oil for dipping to get us started. Shortly after that, the waiter came by with a platter of various types of fish available on the menu. This was a nice touch as you get to actually see the fish before it is prepared. They also brought a lovely amuse-bouche of fresh cheese and balsamic with a delicious dollop of rosemary infused honey.  I ordered a superb duck confit as an appetizer. I was expecting a much smaller portion but my husband was happy to assist me in finishing it. There was a generous amount of tender duck meat wrapped in philo pastry topped with candied orange. The madeira wine sauce was the perfect accompaniment to make this a completely memorable dish.   For our mains, he had the monk fish in a piri piri sauce. I had the Assorda, a dry soup of lobster, shrimp, clams and monk fish. Totally different types of meals. Both were amazing. The staff were very attentive and made this a lovely evening for us. We are planning to treat my parents here for their anniversary. I know they will love it as much as we did."}
{"text":"This is a very good seafood meal for those who like rather straightforward seafood meals (think mashed potatoes and carrots for a side).  Service is formal, yet a bit overdone. I felt like the server hovered and interrupted our conversation way too often to refill glasses that weren't empty. Perhaps this was a response to some of the other reviews that lamented the service.  My meal was delicious, yet it reminded me a bit too much of what I would have prepared at home, rather plain and not a particularly unique experience. That being said, it was Summerlicious, which always presents its own special set of challenges, both for restauranteur and patron alike."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! If you love seafood this is definitely the spot! It is on the pricier side, but definitely worth it! It's rated one of the best restaurants in the city and they stand by it. Really, truly, honestly, you have to check it out. Best Portuguese restaurant out there!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last Friday. The place and decor was not that impressive. The busboys were fine filling the water and giving your bread. The waiter was not friendly and welcoming. I guess because he was the only one taking the orders with six tables on the go. Mind you were the 2nd couple to come in. It almost felt like it was painful for him to serve us. The food was just ok and nothing spectacular in presentation or taste. My wife had the Tile fish with a mango tomato glaze. She specifically told the waiter that she was allergic to pepper and he said that he would ask the chef to remove any pepper and just have the glazed Tile fish on top of a bed of vegetables. When they served it, right on top of the fish was chopped peppers and the fish was spicy hot  for her. So they had to redo her order which took another 20 minutes. By the time her food came, I was done with my dinner. At the end of our not so impressive evening, they gave us the wrong bill. When we told him that we got the wrong bill he apologized and gave us another bill. This bill now did not have the two glasses of wine in it. So we mentioned it again and he said, \"Oh I don't know why my partner did not put it in\" . We ended up with one free drink which he said was complimentary but not apologetic for all the mistakes that evening. So, not an impressive evening at all. We have had better seafood with great service and much better ambiance for less the price of this place.  A good restaurant makes you feel special. We never felt it here."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious Lunch ($33 per person pre-tax and tips).  Delicious food and attentive service, would recommend!   Many options to choose from for appetizer, entree, dessert! My boyfriend and I had the following:   Appetizer Grilled sardines, lemon, garlic, extra virgin olive oil - great grilled flavor  Tartar of Salmon, avocado mousse, fresh apple - refreshing starter, you will like it if you like japanese salsmon sashimi!   Main  Grilled Squid, roasted potatoes, seasonal vegetables - squid is creamy and not chewy at all!  Comfit of Duck Leg, white bean and rapini casserole, port wine sauce - great portion and the skin is crispy   Dessert  Chocolate Bourbon Cake - wish the portion is a little bit bigger, but it's chocolaty and I really like the sauce.  Molotof - it is a very light dessert (kinda foamy), not for my personal taste, but it is interesting!  *bread and olive oil was also served with the meal **weekend lunch is only available during winterlicious, normally they are only opened M-F for lunch."}
{"text":"Definitely deserve a solid four star review.    Me and my friends came here for dinner on New Years Eve.  When we arrived, they checked our coats in and showed us to our table.  Menu : the menu is comprised of mostly fish and seafood.  There was also a wide selection of daily fish in addition to the items in the menu.  Our server showed us a plate full of fresh daily fishes (at least 8 different kind).   Food : Decent portions. The highlight was definitely Assorda (dry soup) monkfish, lobster, shrimp and clams ($45).  It was so rich and creamy with loads of seafood. The shrimps were no normal size shrimps, they were tiger shrimp! There was also a good amount of lobster meat in it.  Service : it was alright, nothing beyond expectation.  Because it was new years eve, they handed out \"happy new years\" props and free champagnes for the count down.  It was a memorable night to end 2015."}
{"text":"It was my first time to try Portuguese food, and it was amazing. I went there for winterlicious and had Sardines marinated, Filet of Seabream and dark chocolate cherry tart.     Sardines marinated was appetizing with a bit sour and sweet aroma. The use of lemon and other fruit erase the fishy taste. I was once a huge fan of the sardine in japanese cuisine, but now I feel lucky to have tried this. Though there were some small fishbones, it is still something worth trying.     And things get even better. The filet of seabream was cooked just the right time, it was charred on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The flavour of this dish agreed with the entree, fresh and refreshing.     Finally, the dark chocolate cherry was faultless. It's not too sweet nor too heavy. It had something crunchy on the surface, and it was a nice ending for the meal.     I'm sure I'll come back again, love it!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now, and each was an amazing experience.  Their specialty is definitely seafood, and I would consider this one of the best, if not best Portuguese fare in the GTA.  The sardines, grilled octopus and tiger shrimp are definitely favourites.  If their stellar food wasn't enough, their service puts them on another level.  The waitstaff is courteous, knowledgeable and helpful without being too intrusive.    To emphasize the kindness of their staff further, my sister was just walking by Chiado on a rainy day, and a staff member came out and just gave her an umbrella (she returned it the next day). She wasn't even a customer! It's the little things that leave a lasting impression on people, and this was one of them."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious! Amazing food and service! If you want traditional, quality Portuguese food and you like seafood - this is good! I got the sardines, the pan seared skate fish and the gingerbread cake. My friend got the shrimp bisque, the salmon and the dark chocolate cherry tart. My food was delicious and the main was especially amazing. I regret not getting the tart because it was better than the gingerbread cake. Bread and olive oil are served complimentary and the hostesses and waiters are very hospitable! Loved the food!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were missing the food from our Portugal trip from last fall so we came here for a summerlicious lunch. The place is small and cozy, and the servers/hosts were very attentive.  You're served with black olives, bread, and olive oil first.   Appetizer: - tartar of salmon, avocado, apple: small in portion, very fresh due to apple bits  - grilled sardine: bigger in portion, very fishy and sardine-y lol   Main:  - grilled squid: the squid is super tender and soft! A bit too salty for my liking but loved it regardless  - skate fish with lemon coriander risotto: this was delicious! The fish and risotto went very well together.  Dessert: good, but nothing extraordinary (please note that I'm not a big fan of sweets - kinda wished they had less sweet and more refreshing options)   I appreciated the 3 wine selection on the summerlicious menu so I didn't have to flip thru their long wine list =p I got Loios Alentejo white and it went very well with my food.   Really enjoyed my experience at Chiado, it made me feel like I was back in Portugal :)"}
{"text":"Chiado gets a solid 3 stars out of me. As much as I wanted to LOVE it, I was a tad disappointed with the food.   Strong points:  -Chiado has a great wine list.  -Service is excellent. Servers know the menu to a T and are friendly & helpful.  -OUTSTANDING Octopus (Would recommend to any seafood lovers)  -Great goat cheese appetizer (not sure of the name because I haven't been to Chiado in about two months but it is some sort of tomato/ eggplant/ goat cheese tower)... DEF order it! -The complimentary bread basket is fantastic.  Now the bad.... DO NOT order the soup there. None of them. They taste like water. One of my friend had some green (vegetable) soup which was absolutely awful. No taste at ALL even after dumping half a pound of salt in there.  A second friend of mine had the lobster bisque which was not horrible yet absolutely nothing to rave about. Finally, the prices are WAY too high for the quality of food served here.  Now, I am not cheap by any means and am willing to pay a higher price for a higher quality meal but Chiado's prices too high for what they serve."}
{"text":"This place will transport you back to Portugal! The seafood is extraordinary, super fresh and gourmet! The all male servers in black and white offer impeccable service. They come to your table with the tray of fresh whole fish for you to select, just like in many mediterranean restaurants. The white table cloths are nice thick and soft. Everything they offer is from Portugal: water, wine, fish, servers, decor, etc. This is the kind of place you care about how you dress because the experience merits it. Also, $10 front valet parking is so convenient!!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon tasting menu; person who took reservation was very cordial.  Staff was friendly and nice, even though we did not order wine or beverages.  Food was good but not great nor memorable.  Cheese course had lovely drizzles of balsamic vinegar and rosemary honey.  Generous portion for grouper carpaccio course, but the asparagus was the star of the dish.  Lobster bisque was mediocre: lacking depth of flavour, with none of the sweet/salty flavours of seafood present.  (Try Scaramouche's lobster bisque, where every spoonful is a taste revelation!)  In general, the seafood courses were lacking in polish and cohesion (ex. The piri piri glaze, while delicious, overwhelmed the pan roasted monk fish, which was both undersalted and underseasoned.)  We were very disappointed by the amateurish dessert platter, which was quite surprising given how many good Portuguese bakeries there are in the neighbourhood.  We were glad to have had the opportunity to try Chiado, but will likely not return.  The service brings the rating up to 3 stars, but the food falls well below (especially given the price points and reputation.)"}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious.  3 Course - $28.00.  Great choices, delicious food!  3 of us ordered different appetizer, lunch and dessert and all 3 of us were happy with our choices.  We all tried each other's dish and enjoyed the flavours, taste and assembly of the items on our plate.  We all ordered fish for lunch but I ordered the skate fish and they ordered the seabream.  The desserts, once again, we each ordered a different one and liked all 3 but funny enough, we  kept eating the dessert on our plate instead of sharing since we enjoyed our selection so much.  The service was excellent!  Definitely give this place a try, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I went to Chiado for lunch today and I was impressed by the food and ambiance. Sadly however, I remember little else than the lackluster service now that I am back at home thinking back to my lunch experience. My 7 friends and I were shocked by the service we received. We had heard such amazing things about the service at Chiado, that we were left speechless by the attitude we felt by the staff. Maybe a lot of it had to do with miscommunication, but it certainly could have been handled differently.    8 of us went to Chiado for lunch today to try their Winterlicious menu. When we arrived the first feeling I got was that they were under-staffed. The staff seemed to be rushing about and acting very clipped and abrupt. They weren't necessarily being rude, but they were not being friendly either. But we were okay with it. We understood that things get pretty busy during Winterlicious and the staff can get overwhelmed. That's ok.    We were all able to order very quickly and the food did not take long to arrive. I had the grilled squid and it was spectacular. My friends had the bisque and salmon tartar and they loved it too. For my main I had the salmon, and loved the crust on the salmon and the array of vegetables that came with it. We ordered pretty much every main dish in the menu and everyone cleared their plate. The desserts were small, but very beautifully presented and packed with flavor. Again, we cleared our plates.  We loved our meal.   And then it all went down hill from here....  1 person in our party had ordered a glass of wine, one had a sprite and 2 had coffees. We received the bill and we were charged for 2 glasses of wine, so my friend asked for the correction to be made. No problem. Then we all calculated our totals, and had to call our waiter over several times to ask questions (how much tip were we being charged for example), but getting our waiter's attention was like pulling teeth. He was always around us, but just seemed to not be able to see us. I had to raise my voice to have him come over with a machine so we could take care of the bill. We all added more than 18% to the tip because we really did like the food. When we thought the bill had been settled, the waiter came over to our table and made an \"announcement\" that our bill was short by a few dollars. \"Odd\" we said, \"we all put more than 18% in tip.\" So we did the math again and could not figure out where we went wrong. So we called the waiter over and requested the bill. The waiter then proceeded to tell us again that we were short. \"We know.\" I said. \"But we want to see the bill.\" I felt like I would have to get up and physically go grab the bill myself by the way he seemed to stall. But eventually he brought the bill. He then proceeded to condescendingly break down the bill. A friend of mine grabbed the bill and noticed that we were charged approximately $18 for the water. Huh? It turns out that we had 2 bottles of water that cost approximately $7.50 each. We wanted tap water, but instead we got bottled water. We could care less about bottled water. It tasted like tap water to us. But my friend acknowledged that she was asked when she arrived (she was first to arrive) if the table would want sparkling or still water. She said still. She figured still water was tap water. Well, apparently not. Every restaurant we have ever been to, we have been given the choice between \"tap\" water and bottled water. Even as we realized why there was a discrepancy in the bill and were telling the waiter that now we understood why we were short, he was still repeating that we were short.  We were trying to acknowledge that we made the error of not accounting for the water but he continued to speak over us and telling us that we were short. This whole situation could have been handled differently. The minute we learned of the water, we took care of it. We did not complain about the water or the cost. We never said we wanted \"tap\" water, so the responsibility was on us to be more clear. But the way our waiter spoke to us; it was not very professional.  So, would I return to Chiado? The food was amazing. But the service killed my entire experience. During lunch I was already thinking of all the people I wanted to bring here over the next few months. By the time I was putting on my coat, I wanted to get the hell out of there. It was such a disappointing end to what could have been an amazing lunch."}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon a while back. Unfortunately it was somewhat misleading, and the price of the Groupon didn't include the entire meal, it was only a portion. Basically you pay for the Groupon thinking you can order anything within that value (nothing in the fine print saying otherwise), then when you get there you get a Groupon prix fixe menu which costs much more.  They deduct the \"savings\" of Groupon from the prix fixe menu. Can't remember the price of the Groupon but an example of what I'm talking about would be $40 worth of food for $20. They'd serve us some $100+ Groupon meal that we HAD to get if we wanted to use the Groupon, then they'd deduct the Groupon value from it (e.g. $40). Basically you go in thinking you're not going to spend too much money and you end up spending much more than planned because of the deceptive marketing. We bought two Groupons thinking each of us could use one but that didn't fly either.  After we got over that, we were able to enjoy the food. It was pretty good but nothing amazing, and definitely didn't make up for having us feel somewhat cheated. Wine was also pretty good.  Service was friendly and professional.  Nothing stellar to make me go back but a pretty decent meal. The Groupon thing didn't really turn my crank either. It seemed like a slimy way to get people into your restaurant. If they prefaced it with \"spend $20 now and then an additional $200 later\" then that probably would've influenced us getting the Groupon. The way this place conducts its Groupon business is appalling and I wouldn't go back to this place for that reason."}
{"text":"Honestly? I can't remember nothin' about this meal. I know we both had seafood, I had the fish, she had the seafood stew. And fools ask why we carry cameras to every restaurant. Is that long enough of a review for some UFC's? . . .  No seriously. It cost... a million sheets of funny Canadian monopoly play money but I clearly remember sighing a huge relief after converting back to what was then \"real\" greenbacks. Chiado was a haute Portugese? joint I found thru the friendly folks at http://www.lthforum.com . The fine foodie in Chicago claimed it was the best thing since Ponderosa. With that vision of grandeur, it was the one fine meal we hoped for while road tripping.  The food was just meh. From the pix, it looks well plated, we had good bread and I got the grouper. To this day, I usually default to grouper if nothing from the Osteichthyes class looks interesting on the menu.  Thinking back, I shoulda knocked out a few more drinks at Alto Besso and checked out the local \"talent\" with the wad of cash I had.   BTW, is it ok to tip $1 coins? Do the strippers mind when you throw dollars at them?"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food and service!   Waiter was delightful and attentive. Glasses never empty!  Food was spectacular. I had the monkfish and it was the best I've ever had. Still thinking about it this morning and I can't wait to go back to this restaurant again!  It is a MUST try kind of place!"}
{"text":"Great sea food. Really good. Had the tiger shrimp piri piri appetizer and then the atlantic cod bacalao (sp?). Both great. Will come back!"}
{"text":"We had a great dinner once again. We were just at Chiado & had the whole fish which was wonderful. Never had a bad meal at Chiado. We also think the service is very friendly & professional. It was busy but we never felt rushed."}
{"text":"I have nothing but glowing things to say about the atmosphere and food at Chiado. The ambiance is slightly dated, but in that wonderful high-end steak house way. The Portuguese seafood is beautiful, and absolutely worth the price tag.   I came in recently for a holiday lunch with a couple of friends, and they had the fish specials, and I had the lobster bisque and goat cheese veggie tower. Again, everything was incredibly delicious. I'm hesitant to say anything about the service here, because many of the gentleman on the floor here are professional, kind and fun. Alas, this was one of those situations where I can't rise above...  Our server was the pits.   I think he didn't love us because we weren't ordering bottles of wine, and were slightly younger than the average Chiado patron, but beyond his snideness, he was also just super annoying. He really felt he knew better than we did about what we wanted when it came to course timing, seating arrangements and pretty much everything else involved in the meal. He was very annoying, and next time I'm there (and I will be back!), I'm going to request another server's section. When you're spending over $100 on lunch, there's no time for nonsense."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my lunch here. The fish was lovely.  Perfectly cooked. The service was wonderful. The ambiance was perfect. I felt extremely catered to. I thoroughly enjoyed the level of professionalism. They didn't miss a beat. The desserts were beautifully done. I'm definitely coming here often."}
{"text":"We came here for Winterlicious 2016 because the menu offered a lot of simple seafood dishes. The only (slight) miss was the bisque - everything else was very well prepared and delicious. I would certainly come back to try their full menu."}
{"text":"Traditional portuguese cuisine, i came here for summerlicious, and i had a 3 course meal, i was impressed with the food, really great flavours and everything was perfectly Cooked.i  just found it a bit pricey, but i guess it's ok for a special occasion.in my opinion the restaurant has to much hipe !!!"}
{"text":"Service and environment was fine. Portions were large for a fine dining establishment. That said, the food was only good. Grilled squid was tasty and large, but simple. It did have a good smokey grilled taste. The Skate ( stingray) main course was huge and well prepared but again kind of uneventful. Simple preparation is fine, but at this price I  expect more complexity and artistry."}
