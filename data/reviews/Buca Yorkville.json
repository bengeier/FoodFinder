{"text":"I'll start with this: I don't get it. Buca Yorkville has received glowing reviews from Post City Magazine, Toronto Life and The Globe and Mail, but I unfortunately can't share their enthusiasm for this restaurant. I struggled and wondered if the problem was with me, so I had to go back a couple times to confirm.  I had a mediocre experience at Buca Yorkville on my first visit, so I decided to go again. Same thing. So I decided to try a third time and the same issues kept popping up. Not an exhaustive list, but here are the few things that really stood out: - Hair in food - Burnt pizza - Bones in fish - Salt seemingly absent in certain dishes - Inattentive staff - Cutlery falling everywhere  Those things aside - which frankly should give a restaurant only 1 star - the few dishes that were done right were great. The raw branzino cut table-side is an experience in itself and the pastas have great texture and flavor which I would expect having dined at Buca on King St. a number of times. For the most part, the desserts stood out as they were creative and not something you would find at any other restaurant in the city.   The aforementioned problems can be addressed, but having gone on three separate occasions, I haven't seen a positive trend. Maybe I'll drop by for a fourth time later and see if anything has been changed... but until then, I don't get it."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Toronto today. It is quite possibly the best one Toronto has ever had. The Branzino Crudo is brilliant."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday and with cousins who visited from the states. The place is a little hard to find. But we can locate it easily following their instructions on our reservation. Love the ambience and  decor of the place.  The  staff was warm and friendly, very willing to accommodate our request in moving to a brighter table.  I didn't specify that it's my birthday when I booked the table. Our waiter was very attentive and took it very seriously once he learned about it.  We ordered a few dishes to share. The Salumi plated of 5 choices of cured fish, the raw Branzino,  which is unforgettable. Love the way they prepared  the fish in front of you. The Burrata pizza, so light, it's to die for, Stardette and Bigoli, Polipo E vongole, are all very delicious.  At the end, to my surprise, they prepared a pack of freshly made pasta complete with special olive oil, cheese and cooking instructions for me to take home  as a birthday gift. How nice of them! Price is on the steep side, but worth it, consider the service and quality of food. Their menu is very unique, at least in Toronto. Be prepared for lots of seafood. It's best to share your dishes so as to taste everything."}
{"text":"Situated in the ground floor of the city's Four Seasons Private Residences, it can be a little hard to find! But don't let them fool you because the restaurant has a great menu that needs to be tasted and indulged in!  We made reservations for brunch at 10:30am, Saturday, which made us the first customers of the day. Since there weren't many customers, there were more people working (and standing) which made us a little uncomfortable at first.   Because it was our first meal of the day, I ordered English breakfast tea and my hubby ordered an Americano. If I remember correctly, I believe I got Earl Grey instead of breakfast tea because they didn't have any. I was kind of surprised at first, since English breakfast tea is like the tea-equivalent of coffee to many, but nonetheless, I didn't mind too much.  Inside Buca Yorkville, it is chic but warm; everything was immaculately clean and finely set out, which impressed me. The grey undertones of the chairs, brick walls, and the floor give it a sharp, chic look, but the bright warm undertones of the tables really shined through making the restaurant inviting, and keeping the focus on the table.  Buca Yorkville charges extra for house bread, so we opted to try an appetizer instead of regular bread. I chose to try their squid ink dumplings, and we were both surprised to see that it was actually bread! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and told us how to eat it: break the bread, fill it with n'duja (spread), and enjoy! Made with squid ink, the 'dumplings' were puffed pastries that were hollow inside for the filling. What was interesting was that the dumplings were not pre-filled before they were cooked. In fact, the n'duja that was served along with the dumplings was what you were suppose to eat the dumpling with.  I ordered their Carbonara pasta because I wanted something hearty and filling for brunch. Need that energy to get through the day! This Carbonara was very good, and was surprised to see a seafood version. I should've taken a picture of my dish before my waiter mixed the egg yolk with the pasta; it was so beautifully plated! About the food: the pasta was al dente, and it tasted heavenly. The noodles were thicker than what I'm used to, and what was interesting about the carbonara was that they used a hen's yolk (compared to a male[?] egg yolk). I'm not sure what the difference really is, and I'd really like to know. I can't seem to find a good article on explaining what the difference is. Anyway, instead of the well-known bacon, Buca also used smoked herring in the pasta which was pleasantly surprising. Smoked herring was quite salty and was a really good substitute to bacon.  Hubby opted for a much lighter meal for brunch and ordered their open-faced omelette with truffle. Served with some warm bread, the omelette was very rich in flavour because of the truffle. The omelette was tasted great; if you're a fan of truffle, you must try this! Burrata, the cheese used the omelette, is an Italian cheese made from mozzarella and cream, giving it a completely different texture from your standard mozzarella. All together, the flavours of the omelette was focused around the truffle, while the egg and burrata evenly supported the flavours out well. It is a light but definitely worthwhile brunch dish.  After our mains, we hesitated but decided to try Buca's tiramisu. When we ordered our dessert, I wasn't expecting such a different version of tiramisu than we were used to. With layers of mascarpone cheese and espresso, this is not your typical tiramisu, and because it isn't, I can imagine that it may not be everyone's cup of tea because it certainly wasn't mine. The cheese was just too much for me.  Toronto's Buca on King St. West is very well known and probably a favourite of many of us. I personally haven't been to the original location, but I'm not sure if I have to, now that I discovered Yorkville's location with its seafood focused menu. Recently, Toronto Life announced Buca Yorkville as top best new restaurant of 2015 in Toronto! Did that persuade you to try Buca Yorkville? I can't wait to go back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I've heard good and bad things bout this place, went here ytd for dinner and it did not let me down. The service was good, and the food was amazing! The raw fish with lemon juice was really fresh and tasty, the tomato pizza with cheese on it was beyond good. Though the veggie we ordered was too bitter, we almost didn't eat it at all, and the pasta was mediocre. The goat yogurt as a desert also surprised me! Overall, it was very pleasant to dine in at Buca Yorkville."}
{"text":"Incredible service and many of the dishes are exceptional. We LOVE the Bigoli (duck egg pasta), I think it's the best pasta we've ever had! The tomato salad, bred knots and Arctic char were all exceptional, as is the wine list. We will continue to go back for the pasta, atmosphere and wine. We typically love black cod, but it was really, really weak. We would never order it again given how good their other menu items are... Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Beautiful presentation and delicious food. The servers were hospitable and attentive."}
{"text":"In a nutshell, this is a good place for business lunches where big corps can reimburse the expense. I find it extremely hard to justify a $100+ Simple grilled sea bream while you can make it easily at home for less than $20.  Again, folks, think about the location (4 seasons at Yorkville) and you will know what you are really paying for (mostly, not food)."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Sunday and enjoyed it. Modern decor, very nice clean lines and an open view into the kitchen. Service was fast and attentive.  The menu online seems to be different than that in there, so don't look forward to the Carbonara di Mare. Madly as well the combination of low lighting and pale lettering makes the menu very very hard to read. Fine if you are familiar with a dish but for us non Italians it was nearly funny having to struggle with it. I'm all for atmosphere but not at the loss of practicality. We had cured fish and Nodini, pasta with trout and the Brocolie E Salsicca pizza. All were nice but no stand outs, I'm not counting the Nodini as garlic knots would be hard not to be unreal. Highlight was definitely the deserts, the flourless chocolate cake and the Pizzelle, they pulled Buca from a wavering 3.5 up to a four. So good!"}
{"text":"Had a work dinner here on a Wednesday night. We shared our starters. The sausage stuffed breaded olives got rave reviews. The pizza was very good too.    For my main I had the duck pasta. It was very tasty. And then for pudding I had a chocolate hazelnut torte.  Too large a portion but yummy.  The restaurant itself was pleasant. It was hard to find the front door. Signage was small out the front (by the Four Seasons hotel). The staff were ok. Most were friendly and on the ball. One or two were a bit stuck up. It was a pretty busy night for them.  I wouldn't avoid this restaurant but neither would I rush to come back."}
{"text":"I've been to Buca Yorkville at least a couple times before and had a wonderful experience but unfortunately, this time was the absolute worst. Our waiter was rude, grumpy and he didn't care to explain the menu to us at all. Because of their daily changes to the menu, I've always asked the waiters to briefly go over the pastas but his answer was simply \"I don't know what you want me to say, it's on the menu\". I'm sorry but this is your job, especially at the price point we're paying, to explain what each pasta entails.  This is unfortunate because this will be our last time visiting Buca Yorkville. Our table of 5 could not wait to leave the restaurant since our waiter single handedly ruined our dining experience with his attitude.   Aside from the horrible service, food was not as good as before. Burrata pizza, Bigoli pasta and branzino were fine, however, skip the veal and pork sausage (definitely not worth $40)."}
{"text":"Just called this afternoon to ask about making a reservation online via Open Table but since our party is more than four people - it prompted me to call Buca directly to make a reservation. Which is totally fine, however when I called and this guy picks up he tells me to check Open Table next week when it opens up for December bookings and then hangs up.   Have to say, I was booking for a Christmas dinner and instead of hanging up because the restaurant is busy (since your job is to make reservations, maybe he should have asked can I book you in or what dates would you be available).   BOSK and CHASE have better staff - 2 Thumbs down for service"}
{"text":"I was for a dinner since friends stayed at the four seasons. A much smaller venue than I expected and the table to narrow that my 'neighbour' next table elbows constantly touched mine.   The food: had their square pizza - typical thick pizza (thinking Pizza Hut), cheese and basil is fresh, but, the price tag is a bit scary. Also ordered duck pasta - it was nothing spectacular and tasted like shredded pork in cheesy sauce.   Won't be a second visit."}
{"text":"3rd time here. Until today very good. Ordered the Fish Soup. 10 minutes later told it's not available. No other options appealed so ended up eating a meal I never wanted. Should have got up and left We were  supposed to be celebrating my partner's birthday. Her order of Crispy Grand Frito Misto was NOT crispy and contained a preponderance of salmon/catfish/ trout???? We don't know which cause 3 different staffers said something else. The service, including the manager and the chef Ryan Campbell was mediocre and decidedly unhelpful. They seemed to think saying sorry 10 times and have a nice day/ I kid you not Solved the issues. They were not customer oriented or problem solving oriented. They were arrogant and behave like a third rate diner. Utterly Pathetic. All the people we told --go , will now be redirected- don't go.  Children, Can You Spell ARROGANCE.?"}
{"text":"Interesting food, but service was pretentious.  I guess they expect some sort of minimum order because our server actually asked us \"you're going to order more right?\" after stopping in for a late 9pm restaurant grazing.  The cured seafood antipasti was interesting but not amazing.  The standout dish was the swordfish belly but the portion was small.  The black ink squid ravioli was an interesting thing to do w/ bread but there wasn't much flavor to the bread."}
{"text":"Went to Buca Yorkville on a Friday Afternoon for a little desert and espresso and was completely wowed.  We ended up sitting at bar because we were not going to stay too long. I must say the deserts was to die for. We ordered the zeppoli and the tiramisu and actually consider a second order.  The espresso was perfectly made.  The bartender Adam at the bar was amazing. Service all together was amazing.  I can't wait to come back to have dinner."}
{"text":"The food is very underwhelming. The ingredients are obscure for obscurity sake and frankly just isn't that tasty. My quail had more Rosemary than I have ever seen it was like chewing a stem.   The service is great at the top end. But the waiters are inattentive. My drink got to empty three times and I was still trying to flag someone down.   It's a nice enough place but there are way better option, like buca on king."}
{"text":"Why was everything swimming in oil?! Ordered an egg dish and couldn't eat it because it was so greasy!  Also, the waffles are not waffles... they're cookies with icing on them...  The only good thing was the poached pear. But felt too guilty eating it cos my friends were suffering! Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Amazing good service, food, atmosphere!  Seafood work of art. Recommend salumi di mare, octopus entree, and definitely  the branzino crudo which was done table side."}
{"text":"Nice food, worst service I've ever experience for same level restaurant.  Everything was great, until our server decided to WATCH me to make sure I leave a nice tips while I was paying by credit card. Just because I am Chinese, doesn't mean we don't tip... It is a very serious case of discrimination."}
{"text":"another toronto gem!!! best burrata pizza ever!! amazing branzino sashimi!! love the chic atmosphere!! great service!"}
{"text":"Located on the ground floor of the Four Seasons resident towers, I loved the quiet area away from the busier Bloor-Avenue side.  The restaurant has a modern look inside and serving staff are very knowledgeable of the menu.  The garlic bread knots were delicious but the bigoli duck pasta is a must try!  The tiramisu for dessert was very  rich and a different take from traditional tiramisu. I probably would not order it again. Will be back to try the burrata pizza which looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! I was there for breakfast. The cappuccino was tasty and the pastries were exceptional. We ordered the Assaggi of pastries: it included 2 cannoli, biscuits, almond amaretti, cake, sbrisolona, sweet pizzetta and bombolone. All pastries were homemade, perfect balanced taste. The bombolone was a pleasant surprise, the filling cream was to die for! It was an amazing and mouthwatering sugar overdose!! We are going back soon to try other dishes. Can't wait to try the cured seafood. Great environment and service! Perfect addition to the Yorkville scene!"}
{"text":"I have dined at Buca on King for years. I always come back for the great food. We decided to dine at Buca Yorkville. Food did not disappoint. Same great food. The decor is stunning and atmosphere top notch. This is where the greatness ends. Like most of the reviews posted, the wait staff are not very engaging and in tune with diners. For example, our waiter was ready to take our food order before asking us if we cared for anything to drink. When are glasses were empty, he never asked if we cared for another drink. We were never asked if we cared for any wine. We almost had to beg to a drink. Water on the other hand, served by another waiter was always plentiful. It was very strange how disengaged the wait staff were with us. We didn't let it bother us since we were there to enjoy a nice dinner for Valentine's Day. My husband did notice that there were tables available and maybe reservations were not needed. Now that is strange on such an event but it made sense when we left, wow the maitre was standing right there and he did not say a word. No \"have a great night\", nothing. Now this is Toronto, we have many great restaurants with amazing food, isn't is better to go where we feel welcomed, and treated with respect. My Italian father always taught me that respect comes from respect, it is earned."}
{"text":"Amazing meal start to finish. Unique flavours. Could not stop eating. Nice casual yet upscale atmosphere. Only complaint is that they changed the tiramisu. Please bring back the tiramisu in the jar. Soooo good"}
{"text":"I love their food, but not quite the service. I go to Buca not as often as i used to, but i still like their pizzas & carbonara pasta. I don't eat risotto, but my bf says their risotto is very good too."}
{"text":"I really, really, really, really wanted to like Buca Yorkville sooooooooo much. I was super excited to go. I had been waiting for a couple of weeks to go for my birthday.   Pros:  - Fantastic cocktails and bartender(s). If anything, you need to stop in for a drink. Bartender was very friendly, chatted with us, etc while we waited for our table. - Service was phenomenal. Very attentive. Staff was friendly and informative.  - Burrata pizza was very, very tasty. We should have ordered two of these. - They gave me a take away pasta for two to make at home as a birthday gift. I thought that was sweet :)  Cons: - Was not a big fan of the Salumi De Mare. I understand you don't want to go too full force with seafood but be creative with it, you want to bring out how delicate it is, etc. I admire the plating, it was very beautiful. I just wish the flavour had matched the presentation. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. Also, we were given the eel (which we didn't order) instead of the halibut but fair enough, we didn't mention it as we didn't want to make a big deal. - The crisp olives stuffed with beef sausage... meh. Again, underwhelming. - The $26 side of sauteed porcini mushrooms... that were gritty. Every bite was gritty. Perhaps we just received a bad batch, but eek. Every bite had grit in it. Honestly, we should have just had another pizza instead of the mushrooms.   There were very redeeming parts of the meal, but the overall experience was lacking. Maybe I just hyped it up too much in my head?  I should have listened to my friends who advised that I go to the King St location. I wanted a night out in Yorkville but I think if I go back to Buca, it will be the King St location only."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm taken by reading some of the low reviews on here   From start to finish the experience was top class, from the host to the wait staff  We split 3 appetizers, one better than the next, split a pizza and had a pasta each, the presentations were as good as the food taste   Hands down top 5 Italian restaurants in Canada"}
{"text":"I made a reservation at Buca Yorkville at least a month in advance as this restaurant was purported to be Toronto's best Italian restaurant.  We were dressed to the nines and walked in with great expectation.  The Matre D, a slick looking soul obviously very taken with himself, decided to seat us at an obscure corner table in the bar.  As a former owner and manager of several restaurants, I know what a bad table is, and expressed my displeasure.  The Maitre D glancing over our heads with disdain, said nothing was available for at least 30 minutes. I sat down mumbling to myself with enough volume to be heard by our server. Soon, another person came over and moved us to one of the several empty tables in the dining room. It was a \"walk in\" table, but certainly better to being relegated to Siberia in the bar. Our server was great and the seafood dishes were superior, but the pastas were infinitely underwhelming.  The wine list was very nice and the sommelier recommended a succulant dry white.  As we did enjoy ourselves we thought an early reservation on the American Thanksgiving would be a wonderful prelude to the Brett Favre number retirement game televised from Lambeau.  We asked the \"god's gift to the world\" Maitre D for a 6:00 PM reservation for the following evening.  He pursed his lips, squinched his nostrils, and said, \"We have nothing.\" Thus, the moral of this story is if you are a tourist, or if you are not a young European trendoid with a casual nonchalance towards everything around you, you will be treated like waste at Boca Yorkville."}
{"text":"I ordered spagettini with clams, which was too salty. Carbonara was not tasty. Tiramisu taste like just melted sweet ice creme in chocolate. I wanted a real tiramisu. Service was even worse. So much overpriced in my opinion. Ruined my hubby's birthday. Never come back again."}
{"text":"What can I say? The food is excellent and really showcases how quality ingredients make all the difference in simple food. The Bigoli Pasta and Burrata Pizzas are a must. Add black truffle shavings to the pizza for an extra pep.  Service is great and the wine list both by the bottle and glass are superb. I've been twice now and will be back again soon to try the whole branzino crudo.  If I had to make one suggestion it would only be to increase the portions of their pasta dishes. Other than that, perfecto!"}
{"text":"Best italian restaurant since a long time. Burrata pizza is amazing !!!! The truffle gnochi Are top !!!"}
{"text":"Eighteen months later, I returned to Buca of Yorkville once again. Today is Canada Day and I thought best to visit a neighbourhood restaurant for a casual lunch. We were 3 of us. We were received well and seated well. I ordered the seafood Carpaccio and shared it with my wife. It was well presented and we enjoyed it. Our friend ordered Spaghetti pomodoro  and my wife and I shared a vegetarian pizza. The pizza was dry with hardly any cheese. The edges were like a cardboard. It was a disaster. My friend had four or five helpings from the platter and left rest of it untouched. The pasta was dry with little sauce. The waiter took the plate away and never asked my friend the reason for not finishing the serving. . Mind you this is a prime restaurant of Toronto. The food was BAD.  The saving grace was the panna cotta dessert. It was outstanding. I made a mistake of visiting Buca the second time for bad food and service that did not ask the customer why his plate remained almost full before being taken away."}
{"text":"One of my go to restaurants because I find them to be consistent. Food is good, service is friendly, ambiance is great. I don't know if it's still on the menu but the duck bigoli is so rich and yummy."}
{"text":"WOW! Buca Yorkville was absolutely incredible. The food you get here is innovative, avant-garde, and just plain yummy.  Some caveats:  1. This was a special dinner - I was taking out my parents for their 33 year wedding anniversary so needless to say, the restaurant of choice had to check all the boxes: good food, good service, good ambiance 2. I had done my research...this place had mixed reviews on yelp and trip advisor so I was getting nervous. But I forged ahead. Dinner was going to be on a Monday at 7pm  Location.  Yes, Buca is not on Scollard. It is next to the Four Seasons Residence, but not the residence entrance right on Yorkville Street. Buca is located next to the Four Seasons Residence entrance crossing the hotel's courtyard. It literally is closer to the Rose Garden.  Upon entering, a man greeted us and printed a ticket which I assumed to be our table reso. My mom was apprehensive about the seating because she didn't want to be seated against the wall (tables close to each other). We were very lucky that we got a table all to ourselves (the one closest to the private dining area). And yes, it does get noisy and loud here (a negative common in reviews). I think we were lucky because of our table...the noise didn't bother us too much.  Our waitress was fantastic! Lisa explained everything to us...went step by step explaining the menu (another negative of Buca Yorkville is the service...luckily, we loved our waitress).  Food. Okay, please order the following: 1. Squid Ink dumpling (YUM) 2. Baked whole fish in salt (1500mg is more than enough for 4 people). We ordered the artic char and the fish was tender tender 3. Raw branzino covered in Sicilian unfiltered olive oil. THIS WAS MY FAVE! What a lovely way to begin the dinner. Literally, Lisa took this fresh fish and sliced thin and delicate raw slices. The unfiltered olive oil was so perfect, and with a light spritz of lemon and salt, this dish was so simple, yet so utterly delish 4. Duck pasta (Bigoli). Pasta was perfectly al-dente and the sauce was very yummy 5. Suckling Pig - this was a very tender piece. For the meat eaters, this is really good. 6. Oysters - fresh and with this lovely foamy sauce. 7. Deserts we had the tiramisu which is a deconstructed version (yum) and the panna cotta which is such a little pretty bomb, we didn't want to eat it. Good for a lighter dessert.  Not so much: 1. The Nodini was not that great. A lot of the reviews highly recommended this dish, but inmo, it wasn't that special. Basically hard, little bread balls with garlic. 2. Funghi pizza - not what I was expecting. I would not order this pizza again as the gorgonzola cheese was overpowering. Not a lot of mushrooms. I would however order another pizza as I liked the consistency of the crust.  Conclusion?  We had such a fab time. The food really is different and unlike anything I have eaten, which is refreshing. Some of the other reviews indicated that the portions here are smaller, but our table actually shared everything and had to take food home. I would highly recommend sharing everything so you can order and taste more dishes.   Wine prices aren't that bad too. Yes you can order in the 100's but there are also a lot of 60-70 options. Lots of glass choices so you can taste.  Would I come back here? Absolutely! It definitely is a great special occasion place. Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed the food, service and ambiance."}
{"text":"Just returned from a superlative experience at Buca Y  If any of the Bucas were in NYC or any Italian city I'm convinced they'd be hard to get into.   Ambience: connected to the Four Seasons residence, so design cues are similar Service: We sat at the bar. Then bartender an import from Italy and another gal at the bar were super friendly and helpful. Other staff were equally friendly and helpful. Food: Delicious! Value: we had the duck Ragu, squid ink Fritto (bread dumplings), 2 glasses of vino, a beer, tiramisu and bruschetta pizza all came to 130$ and we were stuffed.  Overall: personally, on all the counts I think the main buca rivals and surpasses this one (except service)."}
{"text":"An EMBARRASSMENT.  After a stellar evening at Buca King St, my partner and I selected Buca Yorkville to host a much anticipated couples' dinner.  We were the first table to arrive yet had to flag someone down for drinks after waiting an unacceptably long period without service.  I had to ask who our primary server was, as he was so inattentive I didnt realize he was even assigned to our table.  He was completely unhelpful; made no menu suggestions whatsoever and never made eye contact unless I waved him down.  The food was decent.  Obviously high quality ingredients but nothing stood out from our 5 course meal except the perfectly prepared octopus dish.    We would have been willing to spend DOUBLE our final bill if only our server had taken a moment to guide us regarding portions and pairings.  Do NOT waste your time/money at this resto.  I can't believe this resto bears the same name as the establishment on King.  A total disgrace.  Were it not for the excellent company & convo I would have been completely mortified that I recommended this restaurant."}
{"text":"Literally one of the best meals in Toronto! We splurged with the crudo misto, followed by burrata and fungi pizzas, eggplant parmigiana, the octopus dish and pizelle desert.   The crudo misto is expensive ($140) but the freshest most delicious tasting raw fish...its like eating the fish right out of the ocean   The pizzas are crispy, simple and super flavorful  The eggplant parm is rich crunchy eggplant with creamy burrata and anchovies.. just delish!  The squid was beautifully cooked ...the only slight setback was the broth which was a bit salty   The pizelle is a light and beautifully flavored lemony desert with the soft pear center   Overall my fave...still salivating thinking about this meal and the service was on point...thanks Luca!"}
{"text":"Had a great time at Buca this past weekend. Overall the main courses were excellent but marks were taken off for the location. The main entrance is actually not on the Scollard St. I should've read some reviews before I went, it was mentioned a couple of times. Read and see more photos on my blog: http://www.fromwhereim.com/buca-yorkville-review/"}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday celebration.  The food was all very delicious but pricey and small portions.  We were greeted upon entering with a \"buonasera\" like in Italy so that was nice.  I got the bucatini with geoduck clams.  Had great flavour and texture but the portion wasn't big.  I guess it's like Italy where you get pasta and then an entree.  My friend had a pizza.  We shared bread knots which were very tasty and a layer eggplant and zucchini side.  I would like to try the seafood offerings next time."}
{"text":"It's ok, but I probably won't be back as their prices don't reflect good value for food quality.  Service here is good though. Tons of other Italian places to enjoy in the city. The ones in the Junction were way better (Bricco, Nodo).  Ambience - Lots of exposed concrete and fake wood. Lifeless modern chic.  We came as a party of 10, and were well served. What was nice was that they didn't do the mandatory tip at the end. I hope my family took care of them well.  Starters Oysters on the half shell - Very nice.  They served them with a small slice of prosciutto or something like it on top of each one.  Good spin.  Platters for various smoked fish/seafood - We tried them all. Easy to do with a party our size. Most were good, something I haven't had before in this format. Very nicely done, and is a good start to the meal.   Mains This is where it starts slipping.  Soup dumpling dish - This was a small soup dumpling dish. What's funny is that the description doesn't mention that it's in a soup. The servers were quick to mention that it was a soup though, so not the best for sharing; which, was also not true as they could've divided the dumplings and the soup. Further, if you have to warn people about the fact that's in a soup and ppl seem disappointed, you should make something else.  To me, this tasted and felt like an Italian spin of Chinese wontons.  I'd rather have cheaper awesome wontons.  Bison shortrib - Could've been more tender. Sauce was good. Expensive for what it was.  Gnocchi - The winner dish of the evening, for sure. Creamy, hand made, rich. They met expectations, but, not awesome. Just 4/5.  Pizza - My niece chose the Scamorza, which seems like their classic. The issue here: it had blotches of very spicy peppers. There was no reference to its spicyness anywhere in the description. I have an average tolerance for spicy (I enjoy vindaloo, but don't ask for them to crank it up or anything), but even this was too spicy to enjoy.  At the end of the mains, I'm at about a 3.5 stars, with exception to the desserts & pricing.   Desserts Here, I go from 3.5 to 3, without factoring for pricing. Panna cotta is my favourite Italian dessert. A very generous portion, but they put this sweet/sour jelly underneath it. Why!? I can't remember what others had, but no one came away oohing or aahing, which is the typical effect of when I take people out in the city.  Finally, when I factor in the high pricing of this place, I'd have to go from a 3 to a 2. Toronto has some great Italian restos, but Buca Yorkville is not one of them.  Saving grace is the service and accommodating nature."}
{"text":"My friends treated me to surprise birthday dinner here the other night. The atmosphere can be described as cozy, upscale, and casual - no dress code, but you'll see some well-dressed individuals because it's Yorkville and the restaurant shares a building with the Four Seasons Residences. It's not a large space, so be sure to make a reservation in advance to avoid disappointment. To match the location, prices are rather high, so be warned. If you're mostly into the food, the restaurant can still be affordable for a special occasion if you forgo drinks with your meal. Some may feel uncomfortable in the setting or feel looked down upon based on appearance (the \"can you afford this\" vibe may exist) but I found my server to exhibit none of these negativities.  This location is seafood oriented, so stay away if you're not into that because there will be limited alternative options. The menu is seasonal and changes regularly, so there's potentially something new every time.  Upon arrival my server introduced herself to the table- Jessica if I recall, and offered an introduction to the menu - fully memorized, all sections covered in detail, ready to answer any questions. Often at other places you get a personalized rendition, such as your waiter's personal preferences intertwined with the description, or details only on what the server remembered. Here the menu introduction was concise yet comprehensive, and most importantly attractive. Hearing the introduction let me know what I wanted to eat and my decision-making was quickly simplified. Contrary to some other reviews, I found my server to be very attentive and accommodating, and not stuck up at all.  For starters, the table got Nodini (crunch breadstick knots with olive oil and garlic), Puntarelle (braised chicory in wine vinegar), Funghi (sautéed mushrooms), and Branzino (raw sea bass, carved tableside and served in a carpaccio-like style) to share. Interesting to watch the prep process, and your server will give some explanation after the fish has been cut up.  I ended up ordering the Bigoli pasta as my main, which featured a duck yolk pasta, duck ragu, mascarpone, and spices. The portions for all the plates come on the small side, but the pasta is quite filling and denser than what you get at other places as its handmade, so don't be fooled. They do not skimp out on the ingredients, so I feel the prices are somewhat justified. I'll be coming back with a group to try their bigger sharing items - such as their 45-day aged steak.  We tried a pear and berry tart with vanilla ice cream for dessert - the fruit pairing was unique and the overall taste of the tart was very autumn. I believe there was cardamom, but the pear and berry sweetness was the main flavour. Expect the ice cream to melt quickly as it's one neatly pressed tablespoon scoop, and really it goes alongside the tart. The dessert menu didn't surprise me much otherwise.  Overall, a great place for special occasions if you're looking for an upscale experience, impeccable service, and an interesting seafood menu executed with attention to detail and creativity. There's other items on the menu to suit other diets created with the same attention and care, so don't worry. The location is Definitely a cozy, small space - so be sure to make a reservation no matter time or day."}
{"text":"Whereas Buca on King St. focuses more on meat, this location emphasizes seafood, which I personally enjoyed more. The salumi di mare was an excellent start to our meal; as was the raw branzino - light and simple, with the olive oil, lemon, and prosecco complementing the fish wonderfully. We also liked the squid ink dumplings, which were fairly unique. The black cod/saffron pasta I ordered for my main was excellent as well, the richness of the cod balancing wonderfully with the rest of the dish. The tiramisu dessert was decently tasty, although a bit rich and dense.    Our server was warm and engaging yet professional, doing a wonderful job of ensuring that our dinner was enjoyable. He also masterfully carved and plated the branzino tableside.   The restaurant features simple modern decor, with a warm and pleasant space that makes for a relaxed yet upscale vibe that feels more inviting than the King St. location."}
{"text":"Took me longer than usual to decide how I was going to review this one.  Something about it felt three stars to me, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was -- so I had to reflect on the experience with some distance.  First - this is a fine dining restaurant.  It is sometimes easy to forget that Italian food, seemingly rustic and simple, can be fine dining.  Reminding oneself that Italian food can in fact include high end ingredients and a formal presentation/service will help you swallow the price tag.  This is a restaurant you dress up for.  It's for special occasions, not a quick pizza.    There were moments were I felt like service was lacking, but upon my reflection, I decided it was just that I didn't connect with the server at all.  Usually places I frequent or enjoy have warm, relaxed service, where you build a rapport with your server.  Here, the servers are just that - they are there to serve you; to enforce, not break down, the line between customer and wait staff.  It is all part of the high end ambiance.  This is not as true at the King Street location, but the clientele and the atmosphere of Yorkville lends itself well to this refinement.  It's just not something I would want at every restaurant I go to, but it is nice if you are looking to feel special.  Wine prices ranged from slightly expensive to insane as Hell.  It's too bad because the food just begs to be eaten with a delicious wine, and they have so many, but most were completely out of my reach.  The server could tell this and sort of recommended wines in a patronizing way, but I suppose they are taught to spot the cheapos and do their best at the upsell.    Dishes had clean and straightforward flavours.  Not reinventing the wheel here.  I appreciated the low noise level (a rarity it seems these days) and the delicate touches like crumbing the table between courses.  My conclusion: Take your lady or your gent out for your anniversary here!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. The food was amazing but the service was what really blew me out of the water. We ordered the 3 selection charcuterie board. Our sever Scott was super helpful with advising what to order because it was our first time. Favourite selection was the scallop. We tried their famous Bigoli pasta....lived up to the talk!!!! We had a small table because it was just the two of us so we ran out of room when our mains came but the severs helped us divide our meal into two plates. Dessert was mouth watering, must try their layered walnut cake!! Can't wait to come back because they always switch up their menu. If I could give 100 stars I would. Ambiance was beautiful!! And such a reasonable price point for their menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food - as soon as I took my first bite, I just about swooned. We had the - Nodini. Bread knots with that amazing \"ping\" of garlic buttery goodness.  - Bigoli. Duck offal ragu with duck egg pasta - comfort food at its tastiest best. - Black cod pasta that had this seafood unami taste that I just about fainted - it was that good.  Overall, wonderful food. The only drawback was that I thought the service was weak - compared to the original Buca on King West where the servers were incredibly knowledgeable about the food, the service here was lackluster and they did not appear to know the menu or ingredients well. Overall, would return - a wonderful meal all in all!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Buca for their Mediterranean style seafood and raw table side carved fish !   I feel the service is much better during lunch although the lunch menu doesn't serve a big selection. Dinner time has more to choose from and my personal fave is the Crudo Misto for those that are raw fish lovers !!  Their pastas aren't the star of the show in my opinion, they do however have a great use of fresh and unique ingredients !   Definitely reccomend to anyone who's in Toronto"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Buca group, especially Bar Buca. I went to Buca Yorkville for dinner over a year ago and it was a great experience. More recently, I went to BY for brunch and was disappointed with the meal. The pizza pomodoro with fresh burrata was delicious and fresh, but the pasta (bucatini alla carbonara) was a huge let down. It was overcooked, unseasoned and almost cold. The pizelle dessert was impressive to look at but very, very sweet. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Ah, Buca.  Where do I even begin....  Before I start, Chef Rob Gentile is great at what he does.  Don't get me wrong.  His creations and his taste had me thinking that he exceeds all expectations when it comes to his food.  And he did....  However...  If you're looking for your typical traditional, comforting Italian food, this is not the place to be.  I was first made aware of Buca about a year ago, after hearing about the restaurant through a friend.  I figured, I might as well give it a shot.  The atmosphere: The atmosphere was very inviting... Very rustic looking.  The restaurant is somewhat hard to find, but we made it after several attempts.  The restaurant itself was very busy for a Thursday night, and our waiter was very pleasant.  I would have to say the waiter was probably the best part of our experience at Buca to say the least.  He was inviting, personable, and attentive.  I came to Buca as a party of 4.  The food: Like I stated before, you're not going to dine at Buca on hefty portions of gnocchi, spaghetti, or hearty pizza.  The food is different... Even reading the menu is different in itself- You won't find sheep brains anywhere else, I can probably guarantee that.  I opted for their Gnocco Fritto (squid ink dumplings)... Not my taste at all, I realized after the fact, but I forced myself to eat it.  My tongue stayed black for 2 days after the fact.  My party started out with the Branzino, a whole fish cured at my table, soaked in olive oil and lemon juice.  It was barely enough for the 4 of us as a starter.  My partner tried the Ravioli Doppi, which is their lobster-stuffed ravioli, as a main.  The ravioli itself was very tasty, but the portion was so tiny... I mean, a plate of ravioli for $39, and there were probably a total of 4 pieces in the dish.  Very disappointing for the price we paid.  We also tried the Burrata pizza, which was probably my favourite dish.  Still, not enough to share with the 4 of us.  The price: I should have done my homework before making my reservations at Buca.  The prices are astronomical, in my opinion.  I dined with 4 guests (myself included), and it cost us well over $400.  Regardless of the alcohol we consumed, the food was extremely pricey, and we left without feeling completely full.  I would probably return to Buca for drinks, at the very most."}
{"text":"We have never been disappointed. The pizza is the best we have had in TO! The salads are both interesting and delicious. The fish dishes I have tried are always amazing. Hard to get into so we just choose to eat early."}
{"text":"Got a seat at the bar on a chilly night during a busy dinner service. Was convenient as we were staying at the Four Seasons. Nice decor and really great service. Loved my cocktail and enjoyed the food. I ordered the squid ink dumplings and burrata pizza.   So whatever comes to mind when you think squid ink dumplings, it's not that. But this is really unique and actually very tasty. It's like a puffy piece of bread that comes with ground meat. When it came out, I looked at the server like wtf how do I eat this? Basically, you slice the bread and put the meat filling inside and eat it like a sandwich. Give it a try, I think you'll like it!  I absolutely love the Four Seasons Toronto so if you are staying there, this modern Italian restaurant is also worth visiting!"}
{"text":"3.5 - mix of average to great food.   Decent cured fish and seafood options. Very expensive, but excellent service.   Cured fish was tasty, but very salty. Bread knots were good, Campagnolo is way better though.   Seafood pizza was a letdown. Very fishy, not much taste. Dough and thinness were spot on though.   Spaghetti with imported tomatoes from Italy were sublime. As was the arctic nectarine sorbet.   Buca on king I recall had better pasta."}
{"text":"This place gets two stars for good ambiance, OK food, and partially good service.   1. Food: Our food was decent--it wasn't terrible but it didn't WOW me. The menu was passable, but there wasn't really anything that stood out. I ordered the Frico (brunch menu), which I don't recommend. It was a fried potato pancake with duck egg and cheese, and wasn't very notable. The \"seasonal salad\" was a pile of dandelions with a vinaigrette. I didn't have an issue with the dandelion salad, other than the fact that it was too bitter to be consumed. I asked a server if it was possible to get another salad. This brings me to the next category.  2. Service: She inquired with the chef, who said they didn't have anything else. I asked for fruit. She inquired with the chef, who said they didn't have any fresh fruit, they only had pre-grilled peaches. I asked for the peaches. She inquired with the chef, who said I would have to order something to get the peaches. It was ridiculous. This is unacceptable for any restaurant, much less an upscale one like Buca. The server felt bad afterwards, so she spoke to the manager, who brought over some grilled tomatoes, but the damage was done.   3. Price: I knew, going in, that this wasn't going to be a cheap place. I go out a lot, and I'm okay with paying more for better service, ambiance, and food. I really don't think the price reflected what I got.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here as part of a large party for dinner, so was able to try several items off the menu. I wasn't blown away by the food. I don't think this place lives up to the hype.  First off, before discussing the food, I want to note that I found a hair in my rainbow trout (which I know was definitely not my own). Another person in our group also found a hair in her food. This was quite off-putting.  Onto the food - I really enjoyed the appetizers, but the mains and desserts didn't impress me much. For the appetizers, the branzino (thinly sliced raw fish) was great. Nice texture, with tastes of lemon and olive oil. the deep fried seafood was also really nice. The seafood tasted really fresh. Charcuterie, squid pockets and oysters were good too.  For the mains, we tried duck yolk and black truffle pizza. I found the pizza to be too crispy and some parts were burnt. We tried two different pastas (one with tomato sauce and the other with duck in it), and while I enjoyed the texture of the pasta (you can tell its freshly made), I wasn't overly excited about the flavour of the sauces. The rainbow trout was very nicely done and prepared. They open it in front of you - it's covered in salt, basil and thyme (I think) and slowly cooked at a very slow temp. Side of green beans were good and flavourful. The zuchinni side was quite sour.  Desserts - the panna cotta was the hit at our table. Light and fluffy with sorbet underneath. Very nice light dessert. The olive oil cake was too dry and grainy. The semifreddo was really chocolaty and alcohol-y (which could be a good thing if that's what you're after!). Tiramisu was too dense/creamy for my liking."}
{"text":"My go-to place with the most amazing pizzas and pastas. We always come back for the burrata pizza which is absolutely creamy and the tomato sauce is perfection. Also, you can never get enough of the bigoli. The egg yolk pasta with the sauce makes it that much more better of an experience. For dessert, try the deconstructed tiramisu, which is decadent but not too sweet, which I love. If you're going for brunch on the weekend, the carbonara with the raw egg yolk was finished to the last drop! The crespelles are a favourite with the citrus zest and creamy filling.  Overall, one of the best restaurants in town, no wonder it's one of the top in Canada!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 My dining experience was really great - the food was excellent and the service was very attentive. I dined near the kitchen and the energy was contagious.  For starters, we had a trio of cured fish, served with squid ink puffs and a raddichio salad. Both were equally beautiful and delicious. Our sea urchin pasta and pizza were both memorable also.   Our sommelier was knowledgable about Italian wines and did us right in recommending something that suited each of our desires. I'd definitely go back - I felt like I missed out on not having tried their whole fish crudo, sliced up in front of you in to delicate pieces. Also, I was really enticed by the beauty of the cocktails being churned out by the bar.  I took half a star off for the venue's odd acoustics - it's fairly loud and the ceiling seems to be the main contributor to the issue."}
{"text":"Ive come here many time following my first review-every time I have gone the food is always wonderful as well as the service. I came in rather underdressed and was still treated with the utmost respect and courtesy, which is usually unapparant in most restaurants in Yorkville, so I was very impressed. The fungi pizza and their bellinis are amazing. Definitely my favourite Italian restaurant in Toronto, especially because if the exemplary service which is always provided.  Albeit, making a reservation on the weekend is very difficult."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the ambience and service. Food was top notch but of course very expensive. The four of us had the branzino crudo, duck egg pasta (bigoli), gnocco fritto (squid ink dumplings), nodini, piccata di vitello (veal and black truffles), and pizza bianca funghi, plus dessert to share. Everything was delicious and presented beautifully. My favorite was the bigoli and piccata. Absolutely divine. Would skip the pizza next time. We also split two bottles of wine. Bill came to 105$ each plus tip. Gulp. Nice treat though!"}
{"text":"very fresh food. I had raw sea bass with lemon and olive oil. Very good. My friend had octopus and it is very good as well. pepperoni pizza is the best. thin crust very tasty."}
{"text":"Morale of the story: one would think resto addresses indicate where the front door is located, well think otherwise...there will always be exceptions  It was for a Tuesday evening - I called ahead of time to make a reservation for a party of 6 at 5pm so the cluster of us can empty our wallets over le vino and other dishes that have proven to be difficult to pronounce before catching a show afterwards. \"Sorry we won't be able to accommodate your party size.\", the hostess says. Little do they know that we do not take \"no\" for an answer since we were all excited to try the newly opened restaurant.  Tuesday evening rolls in and we decided to give walk-in tables a try. Little did we know how hard it is to find the front entrance! After walking in circles, we finally found the front entrance from Yorkville Avenue. Upon entering the restaurant we noticed more than half the restaurant is empty. So one might wonder: why on earth did the fellow over the phone decline our phone reservation?!  Fine, fine...keep it cool...remember we're here for the food. And the wine. It might be worth the confusion.   A pleasant gentleman greeted us politely and sat us down, and without further adieu, continued on to highlight items of recommendation from the menu (since us commoners no speak upscale terms). We ordered a bottle of rosé, the branzino (raw sea bass), nero di seppia (squid ink pizza) and the anguilla (fried eel) to share for three people.   The branzino was my favourite, they bring out a whole fish, uncooked, and slice it in front of you. The rest was okay.   The bill came to $65 per person, which is what you'd expect to pay at a restaurant like Buca, however if I was any hungrier I'd probably stick to a burger joint to get your bang for the buck.  Would I come back? Maybe, if they'd take my reservation (since I despise the uncertainty of not having a guaranteed table for a fine-dining restaurant) and probably just for the branzino."}
{"text":"There are two phrases I'm not sure I've ever uttered emphatically, certainly not when it came to a single location.  I would come back to Toronto just for this restaurant.  I'd ride horseback across a mountain range during winter in a square cut bathing suit just to eat here again.  I'd give up men for this restaurant.  Buca provided \"the best meal I've ever had\" which contained \"the best thing I've ever eaten.\"    SERVICE:  Smiling, happy, not stuffy, casual and personal.  The leather apron clad waitstaff were all very jovial and happy, helpful, and responsive.  I found it a bit awkward they insisted on opening the bathroom door for me.  Avoid the bald pudgy manager with the broken arm (as of July 2016). I am dropping my rating to three stars as he got physical with me upon asking to speak to the chef about making available a single dinner item during lunch only two hours early. He blockaded me from speaking to the chef after I was welcomed just two nights early to the open kitchen bar to thank the chef for the food. The guy should be fired and does not belong in service.   FOOD:  The breadknots served hot from the oven in melted clarified garlic butter and parsley started what would be a slow ascent to food heaven.  We ordered a second helping after devouring the first.  We ordered a whole fish which comes to table salt crusted, along with some asparagus and spaghetti pomedora.  The fish was the best thing I've ever eaten...I can't even explain it.  Deboned and deskinned expertly table side, still hot after the entire operation was conducted.   The meat was silky, perfectly cooked, moist...we literally used our fingers to swipe up remaining scraps from the plate after finishing it all.  The pasta was delicious, al dente but not the way spaghetti sometimes can come very undercooked.  FABULOUS.  The asparagus were cooked perfectly.  Myself and guests all went to the kitchen to thank the chef and kitchen staff personally.  It was that good.  ENVIRONMENT:  Great inside location, a bit noisy but not in a bad way -- more in the \"everyone is really damn happy to be here\" sort of way.    So good I had to share."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of Buca from all the amazing things I have heard of it.   PROS: - Impeccable service; Our server was very friendly and informative; She made our overall  experience excellent  - The vibe is accessible, welcoming and casual - not over-the-top formal; I am interested in eating good food, not having to spend 45 minutes in front of a mirror worrying if my outfit is appropriate for a restaurant. Buca has a open vibe in that regard for a restaurant at its price point.  - Polenta: Must have! An incredibly delicious side - Fresh, high quality ingredients   CONS: - Four of us had different mains and thus, had the opportunity to try various dishes. Overall, the food was very fresh, quality ingredients, I did not find the flavours to have a punch or exciting taste. The dishes were quite subdued in flavour. For the price point, I had higher expectations and some of the dishes (two of the pastas in particular) tasted a bit generic."}
{"text":"Loved it here!  Food and service were amazing.  The garlic knots are yummy, as was the white pizza with mushrooms that we ordered.  The pasta with the duck ragu was delicious.    The next time I'm in Toronto, I won't be back there just for a business lunch--I'll bring my family too."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night with my husband. The location was a bit difficult to find because the entrance was on Yorkville, not Scollard.   We got a pasta and a pizza and they were both equally delicious. I would've given this restaurant 4stars but I wasn't too happy with our server tonight.   Our server barely checked up on us. When he finally came with our bill, I asked him who would get our jacket and he said he would after he finishes with our  bill. He never came back. I had to ask somebody else to get our jacket."}
{"text":"My fiancé took me to Buca Yorkville for my birthday dinner, and I can honestly say it was the best meal of my life! It is now over 3 months later and I still constantly think about this meal.   We started off with the Nodini (olive oil, garlic and rosemary bread knots), which were as delicious as all the previous reviews had mentioned. Then we shared the Salumi di Mare - here, we chose the lobster and scallop sausage, the dry-cured and smoked albacore tuna, and the hot-smoked herring. These were very interesting choices, which I was immensely satisfied with. After that, we had the whole raw branzino; this is a showstopper and not to be missed! They carve the fish table side, and it is finished with prosecco, olive oil and lemon. It was SO fresh-tasting and practically melted in our mouths. For our mains, we shared the Gnocchi with shaved truffles (which happens to be the best gnocchi you will EVER have!) and the Polipo E Vongole, which was braised octopus, B.C. clams, bone marrow, cavolo nero, crisp artichoke and fregola sarda - this was truly an amazing dish and not to be missed!   We were both stuffed after all this amazing food, but the Deconstructed Tiramisu sounded interesting, so we tried it. There is nothing about Buca Yorkville that is an afterthought, down to the dessert. Typically, I don't care much for desserts, because compared to the rest of the meal, they tend to disappoint. Not here!  The entire meal was so good, it's hard to pinpoint what i liked most about it. Service here is impeccable, and the space is absolutely beautiful. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We came here Friday night for a dinner party for 10. Called Wed and was surprised to find availability on short notice and made a reservation. Never had any luck in the past for a reservation at this restaurant. They only had the time slot of 530 pm for Friday night but with no time limit on the table and no requirement for all guests to arrive for the reservation I was sold. The table was great, the only semi private table with natural lighting near the window. Our server made suggestions for various plates to share for 10 and we went with her suggestions. These are likely the best sellers on their menu which also changes every few weeks with some new additions. We ordered Bagna Cauda di Ricci ( sea urchin fondue), Branzino (sashimi style), Buratta pizza, D'duja pizza, Bigoli pasta, Vitello alla Fiorentina ( veal porterhouse), the server recommended a Sebaste fish (baked salted whole Sebaste similar to Rockcod), and sides, nodini knot bread, porcini mushrooms and asparagus. Once we ordered the manager came and gave suggestions on wine pairings on our dish selections. Went with the Kerner white and Tabeto red. Both wines were excellent and well suited to the menu. The whole Branzino was carved table side sashimi style. The Sebaste fish was massive, cooked whole and completely deboned and served table side with herbed oil. All of the dishes were delicately flavoured, well seasoned and not overpowering. The veal was cooked to medium rare and very tender, the best I've had. The pizza was thin and crisp and came with scissors for cutting. There was a generous portion of burrata on the pizza. Pasta was fresh and the flavors different from the usual Italian options at other restaurants.  The service was attentive and excellent. The restaurant had a nice warm vibe, semi loud atmosphere with no empty tables. For dessert we tried the affogado and gelato selection ( maple, zabaglione, ricotta chocolate), torta caprese. The desserts were simple and had wholesome ingredients. At the end of the meal we were presented with \"Un Picolo Pensiero\", a take home pasta for 2 gift. Overall a high end Italian restaurant with southern Italian offerings, excellent seafood options with modern fusion aspects. It is top dollar for quality cuisine but by far the best experience for Italian in Toronto. Terroni has moved to number 2."}
{"text":"s one of our favorite restaurants inToronto. Just know that it is often difficult to get seated after 5:00 on a Friday or Saturday; suggest arriving early. The food is outstanding, the atmosphere is nice and the staff is always friendly and helpful.  love the pasta"}
{"text":"Buca Yorkville for lunch today and this is the third time we've been to this location. Food was very good but the service was dreadful. We waited 15 minutes for drinks in a virtually empty restaurant and a total of 35 minutes for lunch plus another 15 minutes for our dirty lunch plates to be cleared. When we complained the maitre d  stepped in and resolved everything and he was great and comped us dessert but our waitress was awful. When she presented our tab, she said that she was just too busy - there were only 6 people in the restaurant when we got there! Buca on King is a much nicer experience. Would not rush back to this location."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 2 and we asked for the tasting menu with a proper wine pairing. I went in with very high expectations as I had eaten here before, but I had not taken the tasting menu previously. I also expected something exceptional due to their stellar reputation...I even with such high standards I was VERY impressed! We were given seats at the bar, and taken on a 10 plate journey with an amazing choice of wines. Their ability to take traditional Italian dishes and elevate then using seafood is pure art. Some dishes were simply really good...the others were truly inspired. The Oyster with a Fennel and Cucumber foam was my particular choice of the night. One of the best meals that I have had anywhere."}
{"text":"Lessons learned: 1. Order a variety of foods if you can afford it - much to offer here, but any individual dish probably won't leave a deep impression especially as you weep over the $30+ you just spent on the tiny portions. 2. Order a pasta main. The pastas looked amazing. I was a village fool for not caving to herd mentality. 3. Not very vegetarian-friendly at all especially if you don't eat seafood either. Options do exist, i.e. basic pizzas, but why even come here.  ------  Came here for a chef's table experience on date night and was mildly disappointed by the food and ambiance, but perhaps my expectations were set too high after reading about how Buca Yorkville is currently one of the best Italian restaurants in Toronto :P  Food- 3/5. I'm not super Italian food saavy at all since I usually eat like a vegan and rarely eat pasta or pizza (love both but trying not to overindulge regularly), but have been to a good number of Italian restaurants around Toronto and sampled enough times from my carb- and Italian-loving partner's plates that I can say that I was a fool for not ordering a conventional carb-heavy Italian entree (i.e. pasta) at Buca. I was told the pastas here are the highlights... FML. Instead I went for the Salumi Di Mare (cured fish plate), which is more of an appetizer than a main since portion size is small and not that filling despite being protein heavy. The plate comes with squid ink bread (delicious!!!) and a seasonal preserve sauce. My partner ordered the vegetarian and very basic Burrata pizza, which looked huge, but tasted only a-ok. We shared the Insalata Invernale (not vegan since has goat cheese), which was a small, bitter salad, but fascinating! I actually recommend this salad - the bitterness of the radicchio leaves were perfectly balanced by the sweetened Bartlett pear bits.   Value- 3.5/5. For a fancier place, the prices were very standard, i.e. carb-based entrees high teens-$30. Pricier than say, Gusto 101 (better food IMO), but won't put you in the red as long as you stay away from ordering alcohol or animal protein entrees. Small portion sizes, so treat it like tapas-style, which is probably better for sampling all the flavors Buca has to offer too.  Service- 3/5. Friendly, standard, but slow.  Venue- 3/5. Can be hard to find since the entrance is actually not that big or grand looking and tucked away under a condo. Crowded and loud inside since so popular. It was difficult to hear my partner without leaning in... Ayyyy good date spot ;) There is no pressure to dress up by the way - saw a variety of attire."}
{"text":"Fantastic food expertly prepared and served. Excellent flavour combinations. Best Italian food in TO hands down. The octopus and gnocchi are stellar."}
{"text":"A+ experience.  Ask to sit at the chefs table.  Kitchen is immaculate and incredibly professional. Had many things on the menu but have no clue how to pronounce them.  Pizza was stupid good.    This is a top 3 restaurant of all time for me.  I will be back one day."}
{"text":"I came here in April for dinner and wasn't overly impressed, but I came back for brunch last week and it was much better! Be warned, this place is pretty to find, I still had trouble finding the entrance the second time coming.   Food (5/5): We started with the crostini burrata and it was probably my favorite thing. I love cheese and they load two slices of bread with burrata and a touch of fish roe and it is just delicious. I also tried one ostriche which is basically 1 oyster filled with cucumber juice and fennel and caviar. It was interesting and I'm glad i tried it but I probably wouldn't order it again. For my main I had the fregola which was kind of like a chicken noodle soup. The sauce is very liquidy and eggy and the noodles are very thin and soft. It's hard to describe but i enjoyed it. We finished off with the pizzelle which is very cute. I thought the little cream bits inbetween would be softer but they were actually quite firm and not overly sweet. It's the cream inglese that makes the dish and I was wishing they had given a bit more!   Service (5/5): Our server was very nice and knowledgeable and there are bussers that are constantly clearing the tables and filling water glasses.   Atmosphere (4/5): The decor is nice but in the daytime it wasn't really anything special. It might be more romantic at night?"}
{"text":"Buca has been on the top of my must-try restaurant lists for a while, and my birthday was the perfect opportunity to go celebrate and catch up with my girlfriends. I must say....  Buca has surpassed my expectations! The service was impeccable! The servers were so detail oriented and attentive, that every time one of us left the table, they would fold their napkin or have a fresh one ready. Our waters and wine was continuously topped off and plates, cutlery changed after every course. Now, the food... WOW! We ordered the Salumi Di Mare 5 choices of cured fish to start, followed by the broccoli e salssicia pizza, squid ink pasta and polipo. Each and every bite was fresh and perfectly seasoned. You could taste the ingredients, and how it complimented the dish. For dessert, we shared a tiramisu, torte, and Italian waffle, so delightful!!! To top off an amazing night, a server came to the table, gave me a box that was compliments from the chef for my birthday... it was Un piccolo pensiero, fresh pasta for two!!! What a surprise! I can't wait to make it at home this week and remind myself of my great dinner experience."}
{"text":"Tasting menu served by the chef on the slate bar. Full view of the open kitchen. Most of the tastings were really delicious but a couple were in my opinion a miss.  My expectations for the price tag were perhaps met, but not exceeded, hence the 4."}
{"text":"I've been here for both their brunch & dinner, and I have to say it's almost always spectacular. Service is IMPECCABLE. Food comes quickly, servers are attentive & knowledgable, they're constantly wiping the table down & replacing cutlery/side plates... it's a real dining experience here.  They don't bring complementary bread here, so you should order either the Nodini (garlic knots) or Pagnotta (italian country bread + olive oil). I personally prefer the pagnotta- I love me some good ol' bread & oil. Wish it came warm though!  The Insalata di Arance e Finocchi (orange & fennel salad) is so cool, and interesting in a good way. There are so many interesting flavours in that dish, and the way they play around in your mouth is truly amazing. If you're someone who likes unique flavours, get this (even if you're not a fennel fan).  The Crostini e Burrata is absolutely delicious. It's 3 simple ingredients, but they work together so beautifully and create a perfect bite.  The Burrata pizza is a must-order. 100%. I'm normally a fan of doughier pizza crusts, but this is perfectly crisp, and nothing can beat the flavour of that amaaaazing burrata. Get it with truffles if you've got $36 to spare, but I think it's just as delicious either way.  I've also tried the Salsiccine pizza, which I personally wasn't a fan of but my mum loved it. I found it very funky, so you'll enjoy it if you like that sort of thing.  The Bigoli pasta is good, but just fyi, it's got a very warm flavour profile (think cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, etc.). A friend once ordered it without really reading 'venetian spices' on the menu and was a bit surprised.  The Maccheroncini di Campofilone (lobster pasta) is SPECTACULAR. I think it's the best pasta I've ever eaten- the flavour of the broth is absolutely amazing, and it's somehow rich but light at the same time. You've got to try this.  The Carbonara (now only available on the brunch menu) is somewhat instagram-famous, but unfortunately when I ordered it, it was WAY TOO salty. I could barely manage one bite. I'm sure this was just a fluke, as it was totally inedible for anyone.  The apple tart is great!! It comes nice and warm, and the ginger gelato is perfect on top.  And last but not least, the pizzelle dessert! It's as gorgeous in person and delicious.. the pear is awesome in it. It is a bit on the sweet side thanks to the white chocolate.  Overall, Buca Yorkville is always memorable, perfect for a special occasion or brunch with friends. Definitely add it to the restaurant-bucket-list!"}
{"text":"Came here for a celebration last Saturday . . .  It feels a little fancier than King st - maybe the area, maybe it's the #2 designation on Canada's Best Restaurants 2016, but the food most def. lives up to this top tier rating . . . wow!  We were greeted by a bevy of friendly faces, and seated instantly (reservations strongly recommended, which we had). Wine list is A+ - and staff is happy to answer any questions you have. We tried: Burrata Pizza + addition of shaved truffles (not on the menu, but so worth it!) - God I love soft cheese. The pizza here is a MUST try - any kind, they are all great! Bigoli Pasta - Duck pasta with mascarpone stewed in warm spices (5/5 for a savoury/sweet lover) Alici Pizza - super delish  When we return we will definitely try seafood, their crispy seafood platter looks fantastic & was recommended.  Ps. Entry is on the right side of the Four Seasons courtyard on Yorkville, not Scollard."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! After having a great experience at Buca on King West, I was excited to make a reservation at this Yorkville location for a friend's birthday. I called ahead and asked to increase the reservation to accommodate 6 people, and the rather snotty person I spoke to said he could not guarantee it. I thought this was a reasonable response, until I got to the restaurant and it was HALF EMPTY.  In terms of ambiance, the restaurant is lacking the warmth and rustic feel of the King West location. The entrance is also impossible to locate - the address listed on the website leads you to the back window, where you cannot even enter the building. You have to then go around, down an alley, and to the other side of the building to enter the restaurant.  Now onto the food and shitty service. The 6 of us ordered the crisp olives and warm olives to start, followed by 3 pizzas and 2 pasta dishes. The waiter suggested we double up on our spaghetti, which we politely declined as we wanted to try more dishes if we were still hungry. Instead of accepting this, he looked quite unimpressed with our decision and responded with, \"Whatever you want, but one person is not having any spaghetti then.\" In the end it was a great decision because the spaghetti wasn't even that great! Neither was the duck ragu. By far, the best food item we tried was the funghi pizza but I would never go back to this snotty restaurant for the pizza alone.   To top everything off, we secretly sent one of our party to speak to the waiter to order a birthday dessert for my friend. We were surprised when instead of bringing the dessert, he arrived with 6 dessert menus. We declined, and waited patiently for the original dessert to come. After about 20 minutes of patient confusion, I finally went back to the waiter and asked what had happened to the dessert. He became extremely defensive and said \"I told your other friend to pick the dessert when I brought the menu and I would put a candle in it! It's not my fault.\" There was no apology whatsoever.   In summary, I would never recommend this restaurant - do yourself a favour and go to the King West location instead if you want to try Buca."}
{"text":"the food definitely lived up to the name and hype. i have always been hesitant to go thinking it was just another Italian restaurant. but i would consider coming back. we had 2 drinks each, nothing special, over priced alcohol that was nothing but mediocre, we didn't wish to order a bottle of wine (i know most tables did). we started with the burrata pizza, perfect thin crust and although simple, so full of flavour! i loved it, only complaint is that it was a warmish cold by the time it was served. moving on to entrées, i had the bigoli and my date had the gnocchi, both our dishes were delicious! especially the gnocchi, with the perfect amount of truffle, mixed with chestnut shavings and the crunch from the kaleit was the perfect texture and flavours - i can't stop thinking about it. the bigoli was very tasty as well, with the duck, really flavourful sauce. but the pasta may have been a tad undercooked. we also had an order of the bread knots, perfectly seasoned with rosemary and garlic, cooked to the perfect crunch.   food, as mentioned was great - our service was mediocre, if that. the service at a restaurant makes all the difference and experience that much better. by the end we just asked for the bill before we even finished cause we figured it'd take too long otherwise. for the price and prestige that this restaurant is know for, i am very confused as to why our server was so disinterested in us being there. never smiled, made no effort to make sure we were taken care of and that everything was good. we had a different server check in and the few encounters with him, surpassed our entire experience with our original server. i understand you don't necessarily connect with every server, but if he's serving me again next time, there probably won't be a next time, let's just leave it at that."}
{"text":"We were a group of 5 friends traveling from Montreal so we had to try Buca for our truffle fix. We went for lunch/brunch and it was a really good idea because we got to taste their mind blowing truffle base dishes. We had the risotto: perfect creamy mix with of course black truffle ! However I honestly think the risotto was overpriced for the portion. We also got the duck egg yolk+ black truffle pizza  which was perfect . We shared the branzino and even my friend who hates fish liked it alot ! I still daydream about the pizza ! The service was good.  We will be back"}
{"text":"Came to Buca for our anniversary and had the chefs table tasting menu. We didn't understand what that meant until we got there, we actually sat at a bar looking over the kitchen and got to see all the chefs plating, cooking and the master chef checking food before it was sent out! If you're a fan of cooking shows, you will love this experience.   The food itself was excellent, with a focus on seafood. We didn't realize this either (yeah for research eh?), but still thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Pasta was al dente, seafood was fresh, and service was impeccable.   The only reason we gave 4 out of 5 stars (instead of 5/5) was the chef was really busy and working alone so it was hard to have time to chat with them about their cooking experiences. Usually they have two and would get more time to chat with the customers.   Recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm in town for TIFF and was delighted with my dinner experience at Buca.  It's got a great vibe, delicious food and wine, and excellent service.  I started with a greens salad that was simple but really good. Then went onto pasta with sausage and a ragu blanco that was incredibly flavorful. I tasted some of my friend gelato for dessert and it was legit/authentic. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love the home making pasta dishes on weekend branch. Highly recommended even for the price. Would like to go again to try something more formal."}
{"text":"They set the tone at Buca for a fine dining experience but I feel this place is more look than substance.   The portions are impossibly small and the food is alright but you won't be blown away, especially not at the price that gets charged.  I came here for lunch and it was not very busy.   We got a selection of the salumi Di Mare (cured fish 3/5 - more for the novelty factor) and the Nodini (6/5 - very good) to share. I had the Agnolotti Dal Pin (3/5 - just okay) as my main."}
{"text":"I had really high expectations going in to Buca, based on a lot of online reviews. I'd heard from some colleagues that it was good, while others felt it was just ok. After eating there, I would have to say I'm with the \"just ok\" crowd. The food was good, don't get me wrong. But for the price point, the food should really be spectacular - not just ok. It was also incredibly loud in the restaurant - it was a bit uncomfortable having to strain to hear the people at my table. Not the place to go for a quiet conversation over dinner.   I think if I go back, I'd want to go with people that are happy sharing food. Not everyone does, and in the group of four I was with, just two of us were happy to do so. We shared the branzino to start and then the whole grilled octopus with a side of asparagus for our main. The octopus was slightly overcooked and quite salty. I had to ask several times for water refills.   I was really disappointed that Buca only offered two side dishes, given the variety of mains that come without one, such as the whole fish options. I was looking forward to some polenta, which was on a previous menu, but wasn't being served the night we were there.   I love the tableside service - watching them carve up the fish and then the octopus is definitely part of the experience. However, the branzino is served on its own, when it would've been really nice to have some bread with it, or even a side salad. It is a beautiful plate of fish, there's no arguing that. It's just a bit weird eating that much fish on its own. In a restaurant like this, I would've expected the server to make a recommendation in that regard, but he didn't. I guess it just felt like the dish was lacking in some way - it needed something else to elevate it a bit more.  Of the other two people in our group, one had oysters to start, followed by the octopus entrée while the other person had a selection of crudo. I think this would've been a great thing to share. The table beside us had the right idea - they ordered a bunch of dishes between the four of them and shared everything. Pizza, pasta, and a couple of appetizers. I really think this is the way to go if you're going to eat here.   For a shared appetizer, shared main and one glass of wine (no dessert) my bill was about $115 after tax & tip. I really do expect to be happy and full at that price point, but I was just feeling so-so at the end of the meal. I have no problem spending money on a good meal, but my expectations go up relative to the cost of the meal. I've spent a lot more on a meal and been blown away by the food and the service, thinking it was worth every penny. At Buca Yorkville - not so much. Maybe next time will be better."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  The ingredients are top quality and they prepare it with great care. We had a minor issue that was more than properly handled and recognized by the manager.   Looking forward to another great meal in the near future."}
{"text":"I met my friend here for a late lunch.  We got there just as the kitchen was closing for lunch, but they accommodated us.    The service was really friendly and was just attentive enough to allow my friend and I some time to catch up without making us feel rushed.  We had asked for a white wine recommendation, and took the server's suggestion.  I wish I could remember what it was because she described her recommendation as a glass of sunshine, and it really did taste like one!    My friend and I shared the pear salad to start.  It was delicious!  The presentation was beautiful, and we loved the sweet delicious balls of pear.  My friend had the clam linguine for her main.  I'm not a fan of clams, but she said it was very tasty, and it looked like there were lots of clams.  I had the buratta pizza.  It was the perfect size.  I loved that the buratta was added after, so it was a nice mix of cold and warm in my mouth.  The pizza dough was cooked perfectly (not soggy on the bottom like some wood fired pizza can be) and it was not over sauced!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  We came to Buca Yorkville without a reservation at 5pm and got a seat at the bar. It was the only seats available! It was nice as the server/ bartenders were friendly and it was fun watching them make drinks and talk about what was in them.   Nice ambience. It was different from the Buca on King West in the sense that it felt more like an older crowd.   My drink was to die for! The highlight of my experience at Buca Yorkville.  I got Il Fiorista - it was a heavenly foamy lavender drink. Not too sweet and very delicious! A+   My husband got a L'Esploratore - This was essentially an apple cider with 3oz of alcohol. It wasn't bad. On the sweeter side. I definitely liked my drink better. B+  We ordered:  1. Nodini - warm bread knots - a signature dish. Can't go wrong with this! A 2. Bigoli - little did I know that I've tried this dish before at Buca on King. I actually came here for the Maccheroncini di Campofilone because I wanted to try the red sea urchin, but the menu online was not updated because they didn't have it! It was replaced by lobster instead and I just wasn't feelin' like paying $42 for lobster today.  The server suggested the Raviolo Al Tuorlo, which is one big ravioli filled wih cream cheese and black truffle. I wasn't feelin' like having a heavy meal with the cream cheese, but the people next to us got it and it looked AMAZING!  The Bigoli was not bad. The flavours were good and you can taste the duck. The only feedback was the pasta was a bit too al dente for me. B  3.  Scamorza Pizza - This was super spicy for me. The crust was thin and burnt.  The toppings were good. The peperoncini and cheese created a nice flavour. I don't really like burnt things so I didn't enjoy this as much, but my husband liked it. For what it was worth, I give it a B-  4. Tiramisu - Not your traditional tiramisu. It had the flavours of Tiramisu with espresso, mascarpone cheese, but it was served on a dark chocolate ball with a cracker and some type of jelly. The tiramisu flavour was light, foamy, and delicious, but I didn't like the chocolate ball like cracker thing. It's not a cake so beware if you are expecting a traditional tiramisu. I am glad our server warned us before head or we would have been disappointed. Overall, not bad so I give it a B.   The server told us the menu is updated every couple of weeks so don't trust the menu online! It really should be monitored!  Next time, I want to go back and try the sea urchin and drinks! Loved my drink!"}
{"text":"Lots of hype about this place but I have to say I much prefer the ambiance and the fare at the King Street location.   I was a little disappointed in the quality of the food. Only one type of oyster available. Plus I should have read the menu more carefully. They came drowned in pale green celery foam. I'd call it a waste of good outers but couldn't really tell if they were good.   The pasta with mint pesto was surprisingly bland. I was expecting more mint flavor.   The halibut came cold. That was probably because we asked to have the pasta to share before bringing the fish. The waiter seemed to understand our request but the kitchen obviously prepared both dishes at once and had the halibut waiting.   Our waiter was great and very attentive. He noticed we weren't absolutely enjoying our meal and offered to make it right but we decided to leave it be and chalk it up to one of those times you're just not feeling the place."}
{"text":"3.5/5 Came here on a Tuesday night after seeing it on so many top restaurant lists so my expectations were very high to start with.  Restaurant was good, don't get me wrong - decent service and good ambiance - just not top 10 good. Started with the Salumi Di Mare - the ink \"dumplings\" were nothing special - good texture, but really just fried batter - I liked the smoked eel, had the mosciame (yellowfin tuna), salsicce (scallop and lobster sausage), and mortadella (shrimp) also but they weren't great.  I'd pass on the Salumi next time.  Ordered some Nodini too - which was ok, a little on the salty side. Had the Burrata Pizza, great job on the crust and pizza was very tasty - best dish.  Also ordered the Bigoli, which was tasty but really rich and heavy.  Had to pack a lot up actually.  Overall the meal was actually quite affordable and delicious (about 130 for 2 incl tax/tip, we got dessert too but no drinks).  Just my expectations were really high going in I guess, otherwise, worth it to check out.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Came for a date, and because it was #2 on the top 100 in Canada listing for 2016.  We inhaled:  Burrata pizze: really tasty, never had this type of pizza before, cheese is a little runny, drips all over the place.  Squid ink dumplings: seems pretty unique, and had an interesting flavour. Hollow inside and crunchy outside.   Salumi di mare: we had 5 selections and each was distinct and combined with the different sauces was an interesting test for my tongue. Really enjoyed the cured fish. To me it was a new experience.  Lobster capellini: the angel hair pasta was amazing. There were nice chunks of lobster. It was a real treat.  Tiramisu: coffee flavour. It was okay but I regret not trying the panna cotta instead.  Overall, I love their unique and creative food offerings. The service was not bad, but not elite levels of service. Just had a somewhat uncomfy vibe. However, I would make a return visit to try some of the other pasta and pizze."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for a late lunch before the kitchen closed at 3. The hostess that sat me wasn't very nice when I arrived. Our server Shannon was absolutely amazing, she was super nice, helpful and knowledgeable. She gave us great recommendations on cocktails, wine, appetizers and our pasta dishes. We also got the pleasure meeting Carlo  & David who dropped off our dishes, they described them great!   We had such an great experience on our first visit, the food was amazing can't wait to come back to try the desserts.  Thanks again Shannon, David and Carlo you guys were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. We were told we can't be served any more alcohol after we had two drinks with our meal. On top of that we are treated as if we can't afford the restaurant. The bar tenders started to talk negative about us in Italian not knowing we spoke italian.   On top of that the food is eh.."}
{"text":"What a memorable meal! So happy I opted to come here despite the mixed reviews.   You can park behind the restaurant on Scollard (@ 2.25 an hour), but the entrance is beside the Four Seasons Residences off Yorkville Ave. We didn't find it difficult to find at all!   Now on to the food...  The noteworthy: The burrata pizza is phenomenal. The crust is so thin and the sauce is just tart and salty enough to keep you interested. We also thought the Insalata Di Pomodoro was sooooo good. The tomatoes were impossibly sweet, and the stracciatella  really cuts through the vinegar. Lovely. The Gran Fritto Misto was a large assortment of fried seafood and it was absolutely delicious. Oh and that branzino! Wowowowowow. Cut table side, the prosecco and lemon were absolutely magical together. I would order every one of these dishes again in a heartbeat.   The good: We loved the Bigoli and the braised octopus, but they were far too rich to eat alone. The first bite of both dishes were to die for, but the following bites left us craving for that salad we had to start. I suggest ordering this with maybe one of the side veggies to cut through the richness.   The not so good: the nidoni bread rolls were nothing special and the suckling pig was underwhelming. Skip these, for sure.   We also ordered the tiramisu and the roasted almond gelato to finish our meal. Both were pretty good. Overall, we had such a great time! Can't wait to come back.   Top tip: come on a Sunday or a Monday and they might just be able to top your burrata pizza with some incredible hand picked truffles (extra $15)"}
{"text":"Buca Yorkville is a near- rock star. I have eaten here several times and find it to be on the cusp of brilliance. What are the issues here that might inform your decision? Here are a few:  1. It is expensive. Period. Expect to pay a 20% premium for the hip Yorkville location and scene over comparable quality Italian places elsewhere.  2. Hip Yorkville location and scene. Great place for expense account dinners and special occasions.  3. Good service, yet borders on unpolished or pretentious at times.  4. The burata (sp.) pizza and the branzino $49 (sea bass filleted into thin slices and covered in lime, olive oil and salt table side) are two of the bigger hits. The gnocchi with truffle I had on a recent visit tasted a bit flat, especially for the price (high $30s).  The fritto misty is tasty, yet is somewhat of a one note. It is best as a shared appetizer. Salads are generally delicious.  5. Excellent cocktails. Great Italian wine list.   Love it, yet think it could be ever-so-slightly better."}
{"text":"I went to Buca Yorkville with my girlfriend for our anniversary. The restaurant was recently named one of the best restaurants in Canada for 2018 (#4). So, naturally, we had high expectations. And believe me, they did not disappoint! The service was amazing. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and well versed with the menu. He was incredibly patient and understanding of my girlfriends food allergies. He was accommodating and very helpful recommending non-dairy and tomato free dishes at an Italian restaurant (which is usually unheard of!). We had such an amazing night. The food presentation and experience was top notch. I was even impressed that they sprayed rose water on our glass to enhance the aroma of the drink. If that wasn't enough, at the end of our night, someone from the kitchen came to our table to give us a gift for our anniversary. Highly recommend Buca and will come here again. Loved it."}
{"text":"Bunch at Buca... has a nice ring to it, doesn't it?! Well, this place serves up a delicious spread for the most important meal of the weekend!   Here's the low down: the carbonara (not my personal fav) was my friend's favorite! And she's a carbonara connoisseur! The Bombelone (eggs Benedict) was a little underwhelming. The Uni Pizza was the piece de resistance! Move over sushi, this a rich alternative. I couldn't help but steal a piece of my friend's pizza. I had the mushroom pizza, which paled in comparison to the uni.  It was a great brunch, thanks Buca!"}
{"text":"We went for the fame of the restaurant but had to say kinda disappointed..  At first the interior decoration and the food did impressed us. They do offer authentic Italian food and also creatively transformed some traditional Italian food into a fancy form.  However, I have to say the service is not very professional... Dusty glasses, dusty table and dusty sugar tin. How comes a sound restaurant can't even keep their tableware CLEAN AND DUSTLESS?? Another tiny thing really disappointed me was my packed food... We ordered too much food and had to wrapped up for the dessert basket. When I opened my food container and found out there was one piece missing... I'm just wondering how careless can they be so they can't even packed ALL our food?? I'm not a captious person so I definitely won't go back to the restaurant asking for just one missing piece, but just hope the restaurant realizes these tiny things do matter to clients. Or maybe they really DONT CARE..."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner to celebrate my birthday. We ordered the Truffle Raviolo- was pricey $50, but it was delicious! Also, ordered the Bigoli which was the bucatini duck pasta--really good as well. But what surprised me was after we got the bill, the manager came over and wished me Happy Birthday and gave me a box of fresh pasta to take home. It came with the ingredients (olive oil, black pepper, cheese & bucatini pasta) & simple instructions to make the pasta at home. It was a nice gesture and it made me feel really special. Overall, I had a wonderful experience dining at Buca Yorkville and left feeling Happy :)"}
{"text":"\"High Expectations. Go.....but read this review first!\"  Earlier this year, Mark Pupo and Toronto Life rated Buca Yorkville as the number one new restaurant in Toronto. Having experienced Buca Yorkville recently, I am convinced that the set-up and ready-for-a-visit-by-a-writer-for-a well-known-Toronto-magazine, is much different than what anyone else, visiting \"unannounced\", would experience. A restaurant on its best behavior is not the same as a restaurant any other day of the week.  I had lunch at Buca Yorkville recently and based on all the hype and reviews in the media, we even accepted a 2pm sitting for lunch. However we made reservation that morning and this is to be expected near the Holidays for a restaurant of this caliber. Buca Yorkville is located next to the new Four Seasons Hotel however it is not accessible from the inside of the hotel. The design is modern minimalist with accents of wood to warm up the overall feel. There is nothing really exciting about the room and the bar, which does seem a little more sociable, is nice but located right at the front door which would cause quite the temperature fluctuations at the door.  The first thing to know about Buca Yorkville is that it is not cheap. The pricing is typical of a restaurant in or adjoining a 5 star hotel and the portions are inversely proportional. So if you're looking for hearty Italian food that won't amount to one night's stay at The Four Seasons, this is not the place for you. Nervosa just down the street accomplishes that much better.  The menu at Buca Yorkville is interesting to say the least. The menu supposedly changes every day with some staple items such as the pizza and seafood remaining constant. While I understand that Rob Gentile is an extraordinary chef, I don't believe he was present in the kitchen that day. Our meal did not give us the same exuberance that Mark Pupo of Toronto Life felt...either that or Mark has never had gnocchi made by an Italian grandmother. The Gnocchi, (the so called \"signature\" dish) was commonplace with a cream sauce that was a bit much. The truffle oil and the fried sage were helpful, but they were not exactly \"soft pillows of joy\"....that description is already assigned to Cucci in Oakville. The cocktails were however very good.  Along with the high 5 star price structure, the wait staff are not as \"high\" with passion and/or warmth. Cocktails take a long time, and the waitress could not tell us why we should pay an additional $35 to add white truffle oil to the gnocchi (I guess we just wanted to be humored or spoken to by someone with a bit of passion that would be present when working for the best rated new restaurant in Toronto) . And I will get to the menu in a minute. We ordered the Nodini and Olives and asked for them together as an appetizer and we ordered the sea bass and gnocchi and asked them to be brought together.  The so-called \"famous\" nodini are actually bread balls, rolled in olive oil, sprinkled with rosemary and baked in an oven. And they are OK when served warm but tend to fade quickly after a few minutes at the table. And the olives stuffed with pork, which we asked to be brought at the same time, were nowhere in sight. They arrived much later. Then we received the sea bass which was 3 small pieces in a tomato based broth (or so it seemed) and the gnocchi were nowhere in sight. In that time our original waitress disappeared, a new one showed up unannounced and by the time we were finished a third wait staff took over.  The credit in the wait staff goes to the second waitress who advised the manager that we were not happy with the separate arrivals of dishes we asked to come at the same time. The manager came over and apologized for the mix up. And where all else seemed to go wrong, the manager (Andreas?) acted professionally and made good on our experience which basically saved eliminating Buca Yorkville from my contact list. Things will always go wrong, that's a given. However it's the way that management handles those situations and in our case the Manager came through with flying colors. A happy ending to an otherwise lame let down in our expectations.  I will go back to Buca Yorkville and probably have a beer and a pizza at the bar. My suggestions for improvement would be:  1. Just bring out the Nodini (bread balls) soon after the guests sit down as a free snack. For the pennies they cost to make (and you could charge for a second round) satiating people's hunger as soon as they sit down gives your wait staff a bit more time to get things rolling. As the commercial says \"you're not you when you're hungry\".  2. Never make a change in the wait staff unannounced. Have the current person announce the arrival of the next person.  3. Get some better accent lighting in the main restaurant. The overall ambiance on a cloudy day is a little \"gloomy\"."}
{"text":"Appreciated the comments here about the entrance being in the Yorkville side.  Arrived at the restaurant to realize that the summer menu does not have the lobster truffle ravioli so had to switch it up. We had the stuffed olives, bread knots, seafood pizza, black cod and panna cotta.  The olives were good but would have been better with maybe a sweet chili sauce. The bread knots look huge in the pictures here but are actually bite sized and scrumptious. The seafood pizza was good and the black cod delicious.   I would like to thank the previous reviewers for the comments on the panna cotta. It was exquisite. Light and lemony offset with the tartness of the rhubarb and then topped with bits of sponge toffee and airy pillows of bufala yogurt which resembled meringue. This is one of my favorite desserts ever and I am not a rubarb fan.  Service was excellent, with someone even holding the door into the washroom for me. Only odd thing - had to use toilet paper to dry our hands. No hand dryers or noticeable towels."}
{"text":"Food, Service & Atmosphere was excellent. Stopped in here for some wine that turned into a dining experience. The pizza is fantastic. It is the perfect amount of crispiness & unlike the other terroni knock-off pizzas in the city. Salads were fantastic. Be prepared for small portions & to try lots of different items on the menu. I like this location better than King West bc it's not in a basement."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best for ambiance, service and most importantly food. There is a reason why it has been named the top restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"They are focused on Italian cuisine but mostly on seafood - and it's all absolutely delicious. The menu is constantly changing so you can come back to for a whole new experience every time. I had squid ink dumplings - if hey have it again, go for it! It's one of the most interesting meals I've had!"}
{"text":"Food was OK, was hoping for more. Wait staff and hostess were OK. For Yorkville, was average."}
{"text":"This place was a recommendation from a friend and it was delightful.  The food was spectacular, the cocktails equally impressive and the staff...  I hope they know how lucky they are to have such a solid staff.  Sometimes you never see your waitperson, sometimes they are obnoxious and invasive... everyone at Buca Yorkville almost had mindreading down.  You'd think about them, boom they are there.  Heavenly service.  You guys are doing all of the things right!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! I've visited each Buca location and it was my first time here. The food was so good - it definitely did not disappoint and was just as good as the original king st location I like the open style kitchen  We had the fungi pizza to start (which is a buca classic) it was delicious! I then had the double stuffed ravioli - so good and you can see both stuffings when you cut into each piece. Not a huge portion but amazing pasta! My boyfriend had the braised octopus. Very tasty and full of flavor. The razor clams it came with were delicious too We were too full for dessert but drove over to bar buca to pick up some treats for home.  Everything was top notch We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was slightly dissapointed whilst having dinner there. From reading the reviews, I thought I wudve had an exquisite time but it was below my expectations. I believe Italian food is not supposed to be served too constructed, n that's what my meal felt like. Everything was sub-par however the quantities and prices didnt meet my expectations..."}
{"text":"My 2nd time at Buca Yorkville, the food was perfect, but don't know why after we ordered the dessert, when the waiter set up the table, I can see the plate is not placed on the table, it was like dropping on it. You can see it was circling around. I hope it was nothing to do with we only ordered one dessert to share for 2 people. Before that the service was good same as my first time. Having no idea what happened to that waiter."}
{"text":"I have been a big fan of rob gentile's Buca empire (includes bar buca and buca on king west). This place is tucked away in a condo building next to the chic four seasons hotel in yorkville. Reservations are hard to come by easily, earliest available table on tue night was at 10 PM. When we walked in, the place was absolutely buzzing with activity. We sat in front of the open kitchen which was a fun experience. This osteria focuses more on seafood but some of the dishes are prohibitively expensive. We ordered the GNOCCO FRITTO with swordfish n'duja and the PUNTARELLE salad. The squid ink dumplings were soft and warm but did not pack a punch from a flavor perspective. The chicory was bitter in the salad but the pesto held it together.  We also ordered the RAVIOLI DOPPI - double-stuffed lobster filled pasta, sweet corn, ragu di mare, lobster bottarga, uncinato truffle. I love truffles but talk about wasting such a high quality ingredient on a dish. There was really no truffle flavor and for the price we paid this dish felt like a waste of money. We shared a pizza as well - SALSICCINE - cured spicy sausage, virgin mozzarella, bariole olive, testun di barolo cheese. Although I liked the crust, the flavors were not a hit with my palate. We were encouraged to order a dessert so we went for zeppole with pistachio cream. Honestly, this did not excite me too much except for the pistachio cream. This place definitely caters to a well heeled yorkville clientele but also maintains a sense of humility with the service. I definitely prefer the king west digs to this location."}
{"text":"Came here because it was in the top 100 Restaurants in Canada. The place is a bit hard to find especially in the haze of the park in front of the entrance.   Food is fairly tasty but a bit on the pricey and small side. Had various dishes here: fig salad, halibut fried zucchini blossoms, braised octopus, truffle corn pasta, and 2 desserts. No bread service offered here - if you want bread, you have to order the garlic knots.   Fig salad was basically arugula and fig. I shouldn't be surprised that there wasn't more but I expected some kinda twist than literally just a fig and some arugula. The halibut zucchini blossoms were fine but nothing special.   The pasta was pretty good and the octopus was not bad. Wish the octopus was a bit more tender. But overall dish was pretty good.   We had a chocolate torta and pistachio cake for dessert and both were very good. Would recommend both.   The food was good but did not live up to the hype or final bill. For $115 a person, it was not really worth it."}
{"text":"Went with a larger group.  I had to arrive early (6pm) but there was no pressure to kick us out which was a good things because by the end it was well after 9.    The first and last dishes to arrive were the best.  The first was the gnocco fritto (squid ink dumplings with tuna n'juda) and the last was the zeppole (roman donut with pistachio cream).   In between was a roller coaster of good and not so good. Some of the pastas and pizza choices were good and others not so much so. It seems the simple dishes were incredible and the more complex were less so.  The complex dishes were also a lot more expensive too. The pizzas were disappointing.  The pasta was hit and miss. In particular, the ravioli doppi was a $39 miss.  The lobster claw and shaved truffle couldn't hide the thick pasta and odd parsnip filling.    Service was attentive and well choreographed.  The service time between  the dishes however, were not consistent.  For example, we ordered some more food (bison and cauliflower) after our initial orders and they came 10 minutes apart.  Maybe it was too North American of me, but I saw no reason why they couldn't come at the same time.    In the end, Buca Yorkville was a 3 hour adventure filled with good and not so good food and service that was pleasant but a bit scattered.  The people watching is incredible too..you mike get a dose of the real housewives of Toronto with all the fixings....fake laughs, fake boobs and all."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday for a work lunch.  Food was fantastic, prices were high but still less than I thought it would be and the service was great.  What I had:  sparkling water,  glass of Chianti and stuffed butternut squash ravioli.  The ravioli was a bit on the small side but absolutely delicious.    The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because there website is crap.  Very difficult to find an online menu and to distinguish between there different locations.    One thing I didn't realize until I got here was that the restaurant is located inside the Four Seasons Private Residences in Yorkville.  I won't be a regular, but will try and come back again."}
{"text":"Amazing from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Food, ambiance, and service. As authentic Italian food as you will find in Toronto, and beyond."}
{"text":"Another osteria? Yes sure, but this is exceptional. As another addition to the Buca family - the Yorkville location's focus is finer - while the menu's of the King location are quite similar, the focus on southern italian seafood is greater at the Yorkville locaiton - and somehow, they have an even more refined touch in their service. Especially with serving and fileting fish table side - excellent little touch. Many different and new ingredients at this locations like tuna blood.    Atmosphere wise - very nice - modern, bright and warm. Service is what you've come to expect from Buca, attentive and slow dining. Take your coat off, you'll be here a while. Note to the wise though, entrance is actually not on Scollard but just south next door to the FourSeasons hotel's courtyard."}
{"text":"I went here for a quick dinner celebration during exams.  I was apprehensive because of the other reviews I had read before going in.   Appetizer - the Nodini was a great starter! Halfway through, a waiter came to our table and politely advised us to eat the bread knots covered in olive oil and rosemary with our hands rather than scrape the plate with our forks and knives. It actually made a huge difference, and you can get more of the olive oil in as well!  Main course - my friend and I shared a Burrata pizza and Duck egg pasta. The pizza tastes like it came straight from Italy! The tomato sauce had the right balance of salt and the cheese was just perfect. The real spotlight is on the crust - so thin, so crispy! I have not had a better pizza in Toronto so thank you Buca!   We didn't try any of the seafood options but we weren't disappointed  Great service, food came on time and my glass of water was refilled instantly!  Would recommend for any occasion!"}
{"text":"Service was really poor. May try the King Street one to see if service is better. It was my first time going and I found the waiter serving us rude and ignorant. Will not go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Dropped in directly on Sunday night '  Morden environment and decorations. Food is quite nice,fancy and pricy. The service was super nice~"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my bestie and really enjoyed our time here. The restaurant is a little bit hard to find since the storefront is a  bit hidden ** if you see four seasons, you're at the right place !! **  I made a reservation so i didn't have to wait for a seat, however, the restaurant was around 65-70% full at 130pm.   Upon entering, we were greeted promptly and seated right away. They also offered to take our coats. Our server was patient and kind, he explained dishes that we were unfamiliar with.   We ordered the Burrata pizza, Crostini al Tartufo Nero and the Tiramisu We also ordered a latte and some sencha tea to accompany our meal.   BURRATA PIZZA 4/5  i'm not too crazy about pizza but this was pretty well put together, the burrata cheese and basil w/ olive oil paired well. The crust was also thin with the right amount of chew and crispiness.   CROSTINI AL TARTUFO NERO 4.5/5  I personally really enjoyed this dish. It's a toasted ciabatta with black truffle, cured egg yolk and parmagiano. It is so decadent, creamy and so so so yummy. The truffle really made this dish over the top for me. I would recommend this if you enjoy dishes that are quite rich.  TIRAMISU 3/5  unfortunately, the tiramisu was too sweet for my friend and I. However, the fancy cream on top (zabaglione cream) was amazing, this cream is made with egg yolks, sugar and sweet wine and was so good that I swear i could have just had a bowl of that.  Overall, pretty good experience and had a server that was very attentive and polite.  I'll be back to try the dinner menu for sure."}
{"text":"After a dozen plus visits service changed over here and treated me terribly.  Does not understand the value of franchise accounts.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"What I like here is that the menu changes and they're not afraid to offer dishes that aren't common in TO. I had some tasty cod tongues here and a raw sea bass in lemon and olive oil, both of which were outstanding and unavailable elsewhere. I watch the menu for new dishes because I really enjoy trying what I'm not familiar with. Nice but expensive Italian wines (Amarone by the glass!). Nothing special about the decor but service is friendly and knowledgeable about the food, a special treat in Toronto. Oh, enter from Yorkville..didn't see a door on Scollard."}
{"text":"Pretentious attitude and overlooked octopus. Service was decent but pretentious. We got the octopus with fried artichoke and it was delicious. However, they overlooked the octopus to the point the knife didn't cut properly and I was daydreaming for a steak knife. Good flavors all around and cool experience if you get to sit at the chefs counter."}
{"text":"You must try Buca Yorkville at least once, and when you do, it is imperative that you order the Burrata pizza. The pizza crust is nicely thin with good texture, and the combination of basil and burrata cheese gives the pizza a flavour that is refreshingly light, and elegantly so.  I do recommend getting the Salumi di mare as a starter, as there are a bunch of goodies there. The duck egg pasta with offal pasta is also excellent, and so is the braised octopus.  There really isn't any dishes that I don't like here. So why 4 stars? Well the portions are on the small side, so the meal can add up quickly. I would save Buca Yorkville for a special occasion, a date to impress, or a business meal."}
{"text":"I had heard so much about Buca, that I was honestly excited to finally check them out. Though I have to admit that my expectations were pretty high - I expected good service, fresh pasta & ingredients, and a memorable evening. And ultimately one of the three came true - it was a memorable evening, but not for the reasons I was hoping for.  ... So the evening started well enough. We arrived for our 7pm reservation and were promptly seated. Once seated, we reviewed the menu, and my friend had a few questions that were addressed well by our waitress. Once we received our first appetizer, my friend had another question, and I asked our server for the answer. The server did not have the answer, so he said that he would be checking with the kitchen. Did we ever get an answer? No. But ok, maybe they were busy.   As for the food, my friend and I both ordered the pasta dishes, and being two people who love eating fresh pasta, we were eager to try the fresh pasta made by the team at Buca. And though not bad, it was boring. The pasta was cooked well, but nothing mind blowing about it. The sauce on both our dishes was bland, and unexciting. I am not saying the meal was bad. It was an ok meal, but certainly nothing to rave about. And although we had ordered appetizers in addition to mains, we both left hungry.   *I do need to point out that my friend did like the stuffed olives and the bread knots.  In sum: overrated."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and ordered the Cappellini - angel hair pasta with lobster. It was delicious: the pasta was very fresh and wasn't starchy at all, didn't give you that carb overload feeling. The sauce was the best part,add of tomato broth but not your classic marinara at all - complimented the pasta so well. The lobster was good, small pieces that added an extra something. The dish was $45 wish is on the pricier side as the portions are not very large, but I definitely enjoyed it.   I also tried what the burrata pizza - what the waiter described as a \"better\" Margherita pizza. It was thin and oval with the cheese added after it cooked. It was good, the cheese looked like ricotta it was served in dollops on the pizza but wasn't. I didn't think the pizza was anything spectacular but still good."}
{"text":"I came here for my sister's birthday dinner with both of our SOs, and all four of us agreed that the food and the service were truly fantastic!  We started with a cocktail by the bar while we waited for our table; cocktails were 10/10. The bartender completely understood our tastes and made wonderful modifications that all of us really enjoyed.   Once seated, here's what we ordered:  Branzino (10/10) - This is prepared table side, and is absolutely the most delicious ceviche you'll ever have, ever. I would go back just for this! We ordered their bread knots to accompany the branzino, also 10/10.  Burrata Pizza (9.5/10) - This was absolutely perfect, with the exception that the burrata made the rest of the pizza lukewarm instead of hot. Still, I would order again and again and again.  Bigoli (9/10) - Delicious without being too creamy. Would definitely re-order this.  Polipo (8.95/10) - I thought this was going to be my favourite order, and it was great, but I don't think it compared to the branzino or pizza. Still, I would be happy to order this again!   Finally, we ordered the pizelle for dessert (9/10) with espresso and cappuccinos all around.   As for the service: our waiter was shockingly present, yet felt invisible; this is the perfect kind of service! He was there if we had questions, needed refills, etc. but otherwise did not overcrowd our space at all. As well, since it was my sister's birthday, she was given a take home package of homemade pasta and cooking ingredients; a really, really nice touch!   For 4 people with cocktails, a bottle of wine, a few bottles of sparkling water, the food above, and a 20% tip, we paid $350. In my view, this is fair for the exceptional experience!   Would I go back? 100%, and I recommend you do too!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Italian food. With a sexy setting that's dark. The waitress was great at making suggestions. The bread melts in your mouth. Definitely coming again."}
{"text":"Wow, I was so amazed by Buca King that I had to try the Yorkville location out and am happy I did. New ways to eat fish for me and I loved each dish. They were all impeccably prepared and presented, by the time they hit my mouth, I was already impressed but the quality, flavor and texture of each dish was beyond compare."}
{"text":"4.5/5 stars for Buca. My husband and I ate here last night and had an amazing meal.   Contrary to some reviews, Buca isn't hard to find - it is just across the courtyard of the Four Seasons on Yorkville. The hostess took our coats and brought us to our seats right away. The restaurant is quite loud, but not in an annoying way. It made the restaurant feel energetic, and like somewhere you want to be on a Friday night! The service the entire evening was excellent - attentive, but not overbearing. Unless you're familiar with Italian wines, the list will basically look like gibberish to you, but our server made an excellent wine recommendation based on what we were going to eat.   We started with the trio of cured fish, which was served with squid ink dumplings. This was nice, and quite different, but I didn't love it. I wouldn't say there was anything wrong with the dish, but it just wasn't up our alley. One was a dry cured cod (I believe), and it was meh. It was quite bland. We probably wouldn't order this again, but it was nice to try something unique.   Next, we had the burrata pizza and the bigoli pasta, which blew us away. My husband doesn't even like pizza, and he won't stop talking about it. The crust is thin and crispy, with a generous amount of burrata cheese on top. The bigoli pasta was extremely flavourful and delicious. The pasta serving is small, I will admit, but the big flavour and richness of the dish makes up for it. We followed with the octopus (which I generally don't like), which was beautifully prepared.   For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake which is enveloped in marshmallow cream. The server who brings it to your table pours some kind of citrus liqueur on it, and lights it on fire! It was very rich, but so so good. The citrus flavour was a really nice spin on a heavy chocolate cake.   My one complaint is that no bread is brought to the table to start. It would just be a nice touch that could help offset some of the pricey dishes. Other than that, the food was so delicious, flavourful and well-prepared. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for a GNO with the girls and had such a great time!!! The service was excellent, food was great and authentic Italian. All the ingredients tasted really fresh, you get what you pay for. I'd defiantly be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Had the tasting menu in November, overall it was excellent, delicious Italian food! Some dishes were too oily and had a very powerful olive oil taste, overpowering the rest of the ingredients.   We also had the wine pairing with our meal and it was disappointing. Our food would come and had to be taken back because our wine glasses were not filled up, they also paired one wine with multiple courses and we ran out of wine quickly, having to track down the sommelier to fill up our glasses.  Lastly, we sat right beside the food pick up station for waiters and it was unpleasant. All waiters seemed stressed and anxious, constantly bickering with the chefs. I would recommend requesting to be seated far away from that."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday last summer. I was thankful for the experience, but let's just say not enough to come back. The service, as expected, was good. I don't expect much sincerity because I know they are trained a certain way, to me it just felt too rehearsed. Not my kind of atmosphere. The food was unremarkable. I really can't say anything stood out. They weren't bad, but just didn't blow my tastebuds away. We had: nodini, olives, salumi di mare, and polipo e vongole to share."}
{"text":"The entrance is a little hidden, but once you find it, you'll be in for a good time.  When you get in, you'll see a nicely decorated bar with a modern looking lighting hanging on top. It's a nice bar to grab a drink and wait for your table. Once you get your table, depending where you sit, you'll see a very clean opened kitchen. I've always loved the opened kitchen, because you can watch the food get prepared, as well as smell the different spices and sauced used for the food. Another key thing is, you know the kitchen is clean, since they kind of have to being an opened kitchen, and you know how your food is prepped.  The staffs are very friendly and helpful in chosing what food to order. We were debating between a few dishes and appetizers, so we left it up to the server to help us order.  The cured fish wasn't anything spectacular. If you haven't tried them before, you can go ahead and try them, but don't expect too much. A 3/5 for this.   The squid ink dumpling is very interesting. If you've taken a look at the pictures, you'll notice the black pocket looking things. The inside is completely empty, so you're suppose to scoop some of the spreads into it to eat. If you've had anything with squid ink before, you'll know that it doesn't actually have much taste to it. The main taste comes from the spread itself. It is a little spicy, so for those who can't handle any spiciness, this is not for you. Overall, I do enjoy this dish, just wish there was a little more of the spread. A 4/5 for this.  The main dish I had was the braised octopus. This was excellent! Normally, you'd think the octopus is very chewy and your jaws will get tired by the end of eating it. However, this one was an exception. It was very soft, yet retained a bit of the tenderness. One down side of this dish is that, by the end, the sauce got a little too salty for me. Despite that, I'd still give this a 4.5/5.  Overall, an excellent place for dinner. If you are looking for some place a little more classy and fancy, with really good food, definitely one of the best place to go."}
{"text":"I've been to Buca on king and at this location for brunch a few years ago, and figured it hasn't changed as I had fairly good experiences. Not sure if it was because it was later in the evening but for price that you're paying I definitely would expect better food, portions and service. The only outstanding dish was the octopus and clams cooked in a flavourful bone marrow. Everything else was more or less like a plain Costco t-shirt; dime a dozen. The service was like they were walking in molasses. They were polite but it felt forced. For example, I had asked for more water, after flagging down the wait staff they finally came and said absolutely (with 4 bus boys standing around talking in the kitchen), and we got water much later while they prioritized other tables. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love Love Loved it. My only complaint is that it is a little pricey and the tables don't have candles and I love fire. The portions are on the smaller side but the food was authentic and amazing. You know an Italian place is great when most of the tables around you have people speaking Italian. My mom had the pizza and it was amazing. I had the oysters and ravioli and they were crazy good. If your feeling like splurging I highly recommend this spot. Cute bar, I will be back :)"}
{"text":"The restaurant looks great, the staff are super nice and friendly, but l was very surprised when I saw my egg Benedict! I slowly cut through a thin layer of the top and saw a big chunk of raw egg white! Without cutting through, I asked the server if I can have it more cooked. They took the plate back, it came back when my friend was done with her food. They didn't apologize or compensate us for anything g at the end. Also one of the two eggs were still uncooked. And when I say that I am ok with runny egg yolk usual to eggs Benedict. I am talking about a big chunk of raw egg white! I go to bar Buca all the time and love that place but I would hesitate to go back here again for brunch."}
{"text":"Very chic minimalist design w/ unique dishes. Very professional & helpful staff.    Appetizers: Sea Urchin Fondue Hazlenut infused olive oil on toast. Tasty starter to wet your appetite. Arctic Char Tartar Arugula Salad is a nice sized portion to share as appetizer or as light Entree.  Entrees: Bigoli, Duck egg Pasta w/ Duck Ragu and Marscapone cheese was delicious. Linguine & Clams & Pasta w/ Black Cod were both tasty entrees. Flavor really seeped into the pasta.  Desserts: The Blueberry & Lavender Sorbet is a must have! Very unique taste. Semi Fredo w/ Cherries good for chocolate lovers. Plum Tart w/ Ricotta Ice Cream was very tasty. Puff Pastry w/ Blueberries and marscapone Cheese good for those wanting something a bit lighter.   Very nice place to bring a date!"}
{"text":"A truly disappointing experience at Buca Yorkville.   First, be warned, this is not a \"dress up\" restaurant. I was seated beside a young man in a bright orange, gaudily logo'ed sweatshirt to my left, and a disheveled woman wearing badly torn jeans to my right. Even for Yorkville (and especially for the Four Seasons) this was a disappointment. Servers here wear blue jeans, and my server had some truly blinged-out fingernails.  Service was the most disappointing aspect of my dinner there. The menu rundown was rushed, and when she finished talking our server left, a half-dozen questions and clarifications dying on my lips. When ordering, I outlined the various dishes I wanted to try and asked several questions around portion sizes- I didn't want to order too much food. Our server waxed poetic about the fabulous, $140 seafood platter; we ordered it. It came and it was HUGE but not varied, being mostly two types of thinly sliced raw fished, simply dressed in olive oil, more than we could possibly eat. The accompanying oysters were not cleanly shucked and did not taste like the sea; they tasted old, and fishy. We notified our server, both that the oysters were off and that the platter was not what we expected. She did nothing. We sent back a half-full platter to the kitchen. No one came over to inquire as to why, to ask if everything was okay.    Visibly unhappy, I pared back my original order to just one side and one pasta dish to share. When our server came by, we stated again that we were unhappy. This time, she practically fled the scene, she could not wait to leave our table. The rest of the service was carried out in perfect silence and with more than a little negligence. We skipped dessert and left. We left a note on the bill, expressing our disappointment and leaving our phone number; no call yet.  The quality of the pasta and side order was good, bringing the overall quality of the food to \"inconsistent\". At this price point, It needs to be better than \"inconsistent\".   For such a small dining room, management was surprisingly inattentive. By the end of the night I felt that my business was neither needed nor wanted by staff. And so, they shall get their wish.   Never again."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about the food at Buca - the appetizers were great, but the mains were less impressive. For the price point, I would've expected more in terms of quality. The atmosphere was nice and service was friendly. Overall, it was a nice dinner.  Appetizers: Branzino - yum Deep fried seafood - yum Charcuterie - pretty good Squid pockets- ok Oysters - ok  Mains: Pasta - meh Duck yolk and black truffle pizza - pretty good Rainbow Trout - pretty good Zucchini - ok  Dessert: Panna cotta - pretty good Semifreddo - meh Tiramisu - too dense"}
{"text":"I came here with my wife tonight for a late dinner and came out pretty impressed overall. Probably the best Italian we've had in Toronto......The service was attentive, the food was excellent and came relatively quickly despite the restaurant being full house.  this is what we had: Burrata Pizza Gnocchi Branzino (raw sea bass cut tableside) fig and arugula salad  including water/glass of wine, it was approx 210 CAD for two after tip."}
{"text":"Buca Yorkville offers a regal culinary experience. The menu features items we don't see often in other Italian restaurants, stuff as \"Gnocco Fritto\" or \"Burrata Pizza\". A lot of individuals may say it's very expensive, but when it comes down to it, if you avoid alcohol, the food is reasonably priced. If you don't have a reservation, you might be lucky enough to sit at the \"Tasting Menu Bar\", which is right in front of the kitchen. These seating usually go for $100 exclusively for \"Tasting Menu\".   A must when visiting Toronto if you ask me."}
{"text":"I tried Buca in King West years ago and it was amazing. Fast forward a few years, Buca has now opened another restaurant in Yorkville. I was excited to try it out to see if it was just as good as the King West location.  We started with a very interesting starter - squid ink dumplings. I had no idea what we were really ordering but what came out was ink-coloured pockets of bread accompanied with a filling made of tuna and pork fat. This was surprisingly good! I actually enjoyed the squid ink dumpling on its own, even without the filling.  Between the 3 of us, we shared a pizza and two pastas. Their duck pasta, which is one of their signature dishes, was as delicious as I remembered. However, the other two dishes were not outstanding, in comparison.  For a fancy restaurant, I thought the service was a little lacking. They had told us that we only had the table for 2 hours (which we were completely fine with). Given the time constraint, however, I was a little annoyed that we often had trouble getting our server's attention.  I think as a whole, I enjoyed the meal but it lacked the wow factor that Buca King West had."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner... yes for me it's a birthweek celebration! Parking was easily found, waiter has a great attitude, talking to him would elevate me, it's probably the chair. Lol. We had the octopus ink pasta, two pizzas and grilled octopus and a board of seafoood prosciutto. Let's just say if I come here the second time, I would get the mushroom pizza, a must and prosciutto, an experience again. Octopus ink pasta made with real ink, not food coloring, you can taste the difference. My companion can't stand it, but I'm fine with it. The grilled octopus was nice and tender. So I recommend the grilled octopus. The pizza is indeed one of the best pizza I had in years, mushroom with thin crust... we did have to fight for the last piece! It's my birthday, of course I get the last slice! Dessert? No pictures... it was clean off the plate as soon as it came, apple dessert with the ginger ice cream is so good! Environment is nice, servers are attentive. At the end of the evening, because it's my birthday, I got a present from the kitchen, a box of fresh pasta, the hopes and dream for the next day! You have to cook it up, the got instruction and everything, no plates though! Will come back next time!"}
{"text":"A+ experience!!! Amazing service, incredible food, definitely pricey ($$$), but worth it! So professional and an all around incredible experience. Keep in mind they change their menu weekly and seasonally - so the one on their website is a guide! Most of that is available + lots of specials weekly/daily. They stamp a new menu daily too.   Came here on a Wednesday afternoon for a birthday lunch. It was pretty empty. The space is right in the Four Seasons area, Buca is the door close to the fence. The space is dimly lit, except if you're right beside the only 2 large windows they have. Lots of tables for groups and it's all on one main level/street level so it's wheelchair accessible too.   Service was incredible!!! Our server knew just the right pairings, made great suggestions, quick, attentive, and so incredibly knowledgable. She definitely made the experience!   We had (between the 2 of us): Apps: garlic rosemary knots, oysters Main: Bigoli - duck pasta, angel hair lobster pasta Dessert: pizzelle and affogato with coconut gelato  + 1 red and 1 white wine based on our server's suggested pairings!  It was about $165 for everything in total (I know!! $$$)   I would highly recommend all of these items!!! Everything was flavoured and seasoned perfectly with a complex balance of flavours, especially balanced well with the wines we ordered. You can tell it was made fresh just from the ingredients. All the pasta is fresh too! It was light and by the end of the plate, you were filled. The portions are small-medium sized, you get a good amount and I'm sure you'll be full after finishing off your plate.   They surprised us with a candle on our dessert and a box of fresh pasta to take home as a birthday gift--even though we didn't specifically mention it to our server, she was paying attention, which was super thoughtful. It helps the restaurant was mostly empty too.   A wonderful experience, some of the best wine I've ever had, and I'll definitely be back to try brunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"Literally one of the worst meals of my life. $75 for a plate of crudo that was the quality/quantity you'd see at a mid-range sushi joint for $40. Mushy warm olives. $46 Alaskan king crab ravioli that was chewy and filled with (could it possibly have been canned??) dry, stringy seafood.  The sad thing is, I have always loved Buca. My team has held events at their other locations and I've had good meals at this one twice. They still have an excellent wine list, but we didn't even eat half our food. It was just terrible."}
