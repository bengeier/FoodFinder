{"text":"Best Chinese Food I've ever had! Fast and friendly service as well!"}
{"text":"Absolute best Chinese food by far. Excellent service-- you can't pay for service like best China has these days. Huge portions!! We will definitely be coming here once a week!!"}
{"text":"We went out as a family to this place as we do occasionally. We got in right away and started planning our food. Our server was a younger male who we have not seen before. One of our drinks were wrong and when we asked for the right drink the server said \" next time same it right\". I was shocked and didn't want to continue our lunch. When we got up to leave the male server cussed us out and followed us to the car. I was there with a female friend and my three kids. I will never return here as well as make sure everyone is aware when he's there he has a temper and is very rude. I understand I have children but my kids are well behaved and I tend to tip well due to having kids. This behavior was incredibly disrespectful and unnecessary."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! I had the orange chicken lunch special, which was a lot different from orange chicken at my usual Chinese place (it was crispy here) but it was good. It's a smallish restaurant so I felt the waitstaff (which i believe was just two ladies) was a bit harried with the large group I was in, but they did wonderfully considering."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. STAY AWAY FROM THIS RESTAURANT. My family and I have been going there for years. I'm very disappointed with my last visit. So much that I will never return. It was one of my favorite Chinese place for decades. We would always go from parties of 2 to 8 and would always leave a more than generous amount of tips because we used to be so satisfied with the service and food. The employees that provided us with great service are now gone. For lack of a better word this place has gone to shit. My last visit there was 3 adults and 3 kids. Anytime we bring the kids we mske sure to leave a larger tip because of the medd they make.  Since the moment we walked in the door the supposed manager gave us a dirty look before I even spoke a word. She kept looking back at the kids. It was very obvioud that she wwd mad that we brought the kids. She then offered us a table where we obviously didn't fit, to which I proceeded to signal her to a table where we would fit. She was not happy about us not accepting the table she offered. We went ahead and ordered and meanwhile the food was ready they brought out the soup at which point i asked for lemon. She gave me another dirty look when I asked for it and then took very long to bring it. By the time she brought the soup was cold. The food came out and we began to eat. The whole time the waiter never came back to check if we needed anything. So when she passed by we asked for napkins and she again gave us a dirty look. She never brought the napkins so we had to ask her again. Again she didn't bring them so we asked a third time. Finally when she brought the bill I saw that they had included the tip instead of letting us choose how much we wanted to tip. We've been going for years with the same amount of people and I know for certain that they had never automatically included the tip in the bill. I was obviously going to question it because for one they provided awful service since the moment we walked in the door so we weren't going to be so generous on the tip this time and secondly it wasn't something they had done in the past. When questioned the manager said that for parties of 4 or larger the tip was required and NOT optional and went on to say the computer automatically adds it and the she could not remove it. Then another employees came and said they added the tip because the kids made a mess. The manager then tried to say that it wasn't because of that. She said they had change their system 2 weeks ago so that it now charges tip for parties of 4 or more. And continued saying that alot of people that dine only tip $2 or $3 and that they need people to rip them more which is why they automatically will charge the tip for parties of 4. I told her that it is usual for an automatic tip for parties of 8 but not 4. And I asked her to show us in writing or print where she notified customers of the new tip update and she couldn't show me. She then said she would only remove it if we left the tip they were wanting in the table. They said we did not have an option and we needed to pay THE tip they wanted us to pay. Needless to say we left them no tip and will be reporting them."}
{"text":"Get take-out a couple times a month.  Food is always good!  Call order in, usually ready in less than 15 min.  Condiments are on the counter so you can take what you want.  Large portions, reasonably priced for what you get.  Hot & Sour soup is the best!  No complaints."}
{"text":"Run Away!! My takeout order was wrong and they would not refund my money even after admitting the error. Owner will not return calls. Kept my money and got crappy food that I couldn't eat."}
{"text":"Sad to say we frequented this place till today. My daughter had a bug with wings in her egg drop soup. When she showed an older lady who was a waitress, her reply was that it came from the shrimp. Ummmmm, there are no shrimp in egg drop soup. She walked away and didn't replace it. My daughter had to point it out to another worker and finally she brought another bowl. When I called the Restaurant to speak to Mgr I got the run around. Then was told his name is Jeff and he is on vacation. Ashley finally took the phone. I explained what happened she said she kind of knew what happened. What did I want her to do. I told her I was disappointed in the way it was handled and no gesture of goodwill was offered. She told me she would give her a credit next time she came in and then rushed me off the phone because she was busy. Horrible customer service from a place we went to regularly. After this experience we will never go there again. Beware of \"extras\" in your food at this place! @bestchina"}
{"text":"Very good prices but not very clean.  The fish tank needs attention as well.  The food is pretty good but if it's not clean where can see imagine how it is where you can't see."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy getting takeout from this location. Lately the store has become a little rundown and the service (especially when ordering over the phone) is really lacking, to the point of being rude."}
{"text":"Great fresh hot Chinese food.great service . comfortable atmosphere.dont know why people have to leave such hateful reviews.most of the time its not the restaurant that's the problem.its the person who is visiting the restaurant who you cant please."}
{"text":"NEVER EAT THERE!!! I called in an order and for them to not fry the chicken wings hard, and the lady answering the phone and taking my order said ok. When I went to get my food I took it home and was serving it to my husband and we try eating the wings alone with the other items we ordered and the wings were fried so hard they were like rocks. It seems to me that they were left over wings from the day before and the refried them. I call and complained to the lady who took my order and she acted like she did not care. I told her that we will never come to their restaurant again. DO NOT GO THERE"}
{"text":"It used to be better, but it is still descent. I still love the egg rolls, there. The new management is by a new family, but the service sucks ass. The food just doesn't taste the same; they were better off as good china than best china"}
{"text":"Horrible service... the waiter barely spoke English. I felt like I was being served by a bunch of zombies, they were so unenthusiastic. The food has steadily declined here over the years."}
{"text":"This place needs a genre of its own. It sets the standards for Chinese Cuisine.  They have amazing food and great staff. Their food is top notch and give you large portions for the money. Would not go anywhere else."}
{"text":"The food is reasonablly priced and always comes out hot. We've never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"They used to be delicious. I live right around the corner, and our family would eat there all the time when we wanted a quick dinner and didn't want to have to make it at home. The last two times I have been there though, it has been horrible. The service is horrible, the people are rude, and I actually got sick the last two times I ate there. The first time I got sick I didn't realize it was the food. I thought I just had a stomach bug and it wasn't nearly as bad as the second time I got sick. The very next time after that I got very sick again. It was one of the worst food poisoning I've had since I was a kid. There also seems to be a foul smell inside, a mixture between them not cleaning out their grease traps properly, raw sewage, and a dirty restaurant with mildew floors. As far as the rude service goes, my friend and I were ordering take out a while back, and my buddy thought he had paid the whole balance, but apparently he was off by 10 dollars which was purely accident. The lady in the front started yelling at us and freaking out, acting like we were robbing her or something and like we did it on purpose. Shouldn't treat customers this way, and if you value your health I strongly suggest staying away this place."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Large portions, too much for one person to eat. I recommend getting one dish and sharing at dinnertime. I started out with Wonton soup, same Wonton soup as every other Chinese restaurant I've ever been to, good nonetheless. Ordered three egg rolls as appetizers. Duck sauce and Spicy Mustard may be home made, but on table dispensed out of unmarked red and yellow squeezable ketchup and mustard bottles. I guess the spicy mustard in the yellow bottle was self explanatory but wasn't entirely sure about the duck sauce in the red bottle. I had General Tso's Chicken and it was very good. My two children shared Chicken and Broccoli and it too was good. Rice was fresh and moist. Waiter kept my Diet Coke, my daughter's Sprite and my other daughter's water topped off.  Waiter was attentive but not friendly, didn't smile or talk at all. Language barrier? I'll give him that.  I gave them three stars. Good food."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Used a coupon from an advertisement. Was misleading lunch was more than expected when the owner finished adding up my bill.  Buy one Get one.  I don't think so!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be an okeh place.  I guess they have new management/owners but I didn't know that till after I got my take out.  The shrimp in the lo-mein tasted like it was coated in flour - the port in the sweet and sour pork had this huge hard flour casing and a dot of meat in it.  Very rubbery.  The egg rolls were good though.  My friend's food was terrible too.  I broke out in hives later.  Will never ever go back and will not recommend.  Sad...it used to be good and the foils there were so nice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The service is Phenomenal & the food outstanding  I can't remember the last time I've enjoyed Chinese food this much!  I would highly recommend it!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. It only took 8 min for my lunch to arrive.  Delicious and service is what you'd expect, fast and not a lot of chatter from the waitstaff at 12:30 on a friday. The place is pretty packed.  Great quality food!"}
{"text":"This place used to be really good with great service back when it was Good China.  I guess new owners took it over and wanted to cut corners and cost wherever possible. The food is ok still but where they really get bad points is their service.  Because they cut costs they also cut help.  If your in a hurry don't expect to be served promptly.  We waited about 15 minutes just to get our drinks.  We ordered our food at the same time we ordered our drinks since we sat ignored for such a long time.  The food came out quickly but like I stated earlier its just ok due to their cutting costs.   Don't believe me?  check it out for yourselves.   It will be the first and last time there."}
{"text":"The quality of the service and food has been on a steady decline for the past few years. Front of house service was apathetic and that led to a less than stellar experience."}
{"text":"Recommended by Neighbor, It was very good. Husband got Orange Chicken, he ate it all, just the right amount of spice. I got the Cashew Chicken Combo was very good. Sister got the Lemon Chicken, was 2 chicken breast, with Lemon Sauce that was super good. Bro-in-law, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Yummy. Combo's come with egg roll, wonton & fried rice. We also got there sugar donuts."}
{"text":"THIS IS MY PLACE! i am a huge stickler about chinese food, and this passes my test. they know my order just by seeing my face or phone number (embarrassing). orange chicken, extra spicy and extra crispy. i'm not a fan of dining in, they tend to have flies. and that's quite annoying."}
{"text":"We would give ZERO stars if we could. Some of the absolute WORST service ever today, and I'm pretty sure it was the owner himself. To start, he refused to give us a high chair as we requested for our 3 year old, saying he's too big (almost but not quite). We ordered sweet tea and it was soured. He grumbled to himself in Chinese when I asked to change mine to unsweet. We wanted to order soup and egg rolls first, and right after we explained this, that we were still deciding which entrees to order, he just snatched our menus right out of our hands and we had to ask him to give them back so we could finish deciding. The menu is generic, limited and overpriced compared to other similar restaurants in the area, by the way. When we had decided a few moments later, we had to try 3 times to get him to acknowledge us, and then he just nodded and went across the room to mess with some silverware for about another 2-3 minutes before taking our order. The only other table, seated next to ours, seemed to be having similar issues with his service, based on my limited understanding of Spanish (he was kind of accusing them of trying to dine & dash as they were leaving too...) . We ordered the Newtze chicken (described as fried chicken with vegetables in brown gravy) and Mushu pork, fried instead of steamed rice. We were served sweet and sour chicken, with sweet and sour sauce drenching it, one very tiny bowl of steamed rice, and Mushu pork with... Mexican flour tortillas? WTF, I know?! My husband looked at it and was like, \"Wait, are those tortillas?\" Yes. 3 store bought tortillas. I asked the guy what was up with this and he insisted they were, in fact, pancakes, and very rudely said that's all they had and didn't offer to do anything except take the plate. I had to ask for more rice to go with it. Speaking of taking plates, he rushed us through the entire meal. Took the fried wontons when we were only half finished with our soups, took the menus as mentioned, asked us if we wanted a box for our food while we were clearly still eating (and less than ten minutes after serving us). The whole time it seemed like he was just trying to hustle us on out the door. After he was accusing the Spanish speaking table of whatever he was confronting them about, we paid, and due to the EXCEPTIONALLY CRAPPY SERVICE, my husband tipped him 40 cents, which is saying a lot from two people who have worked in food service and rarely tip less than 25%. This jerk looked at the receipt and immediately started yelling at us about why we didn't tip him more. I told him it was because we got awful service and he started saying we were greedy and drank so much iced tea that we owe him a big tip. I said we don't OWE you anything, it's a tip, and it's pretty unprofessional to be talking to your customers this way, especially in front of your other customers, why on earth should they tip you either when you're acting like this? I also told him he could look forward to this lovely Yelp review too.   We will NEVER go here again. Don't go here unless you like bad service with a side of bad attitude and a slice of entitlement on top. Or unless you just happen to think grocery store flour tortillas paired with Mushu pork is a flash of culinary genius."}
{"text":"We love Best China.  We have been eating here for several years.  We stumbled upon this great place in a little strip mall.  It doesn't stand out because it is tucked in at the end but if you find it, you will definitely be back.  I cannot speak for all of the food because I always order the same thing, sweet and sour chicken and pork fried rice, but I have yet to be disappointed.  The gentleman (owner I believe) is quiet but always courteous and friendly.  My family loves this place and we highly recommend."}
{"text":"The first time I went it was decent a fee months ago. I went again today 09/15/16 and the orange chicken was disgusting and the lo mein was a spaghetti noodle. I was very upset to get home with my take out order and take a bite of spaghetti noodle and not lo mein noodle."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten somewhere that the experience was just so bad, that you had to try it again to make sure it wasn't just you?  Then when you went back, it was exponentially worse?  Then about a year later,  you decided 'What the heck, let's give them one more shot!' only to have an experience that was even worse?  This makes you an idiot.  And you have company, my friend.  I should have known the first time I went to Best China, when I asked if I could have the pork-fried rice without onions, I was told to just pick them out.  At first, I thought that the very, very quiet man was just joking.  He was not.  Experience went downhill from there.  The next time, the entire order was wrong and had onions in everything when I asked for no onions.  We just smiled and laughed about it afterwards.  Tonight...  I went in before the rest of the family and tried to order drinks and the conversation went like this:  Me:  \"Do you have Sierra Mist?\"  Quiet man:  \"No.\" Me:  \"What do you have?\" Quiet man: \"Soda\" Me:  \"What kind of soda?\" Quiet man: \"Sprite.\" Me (grinning) \"...ooookay, I will have one of those.  Do you have juice? Quiet man: \"No.\" Me (grinning again):  \"I will just have 3 waters then for the family and one Sprite.\" Quiet man turns and leaves.  Brings back Sprite only.  We see later that they carry pink lemonade.  Pork skewers arrive 10 minutes before anything else arrives at the table looking like they were put on the fire 2 months ago- and never left.  They were charred beyond any recognition.  The food that did finally arrive was, let's just say \"not good\".  California has the \"3 Strike\" rule.  Baseball has the \"3 Strike\" rule.  I should get benched from dining out for making the completely idiotic choice to give them the third opportunity.  Best China...  Maybe they put out their Best China, but with the dishes that are served on them, they might want to just consider paper plates."}
{"text":"I have being going to this restaurant since 1998 was good China! Tried many other Chinese restaurants not as good! Wish they would deliver"}
{"text":"Pretty quiet for lunch time.  Service was prompt.  Hot tea was good.  Wonton soup was \"OK\".  The dumplings seemed undercooked/hard and the broth is very greasy.  Lunch special included fried rice and egg roll.  Egg roll seemed overdone/hard/dark like it was over fried or cooked in old oil.  Fried rice was plain and bland.  Beef in garlic sauce was good, except the sauce was way too sweet and thick.  I wish I had better news, but chances are good this place will go the way most of the rest of the establishments in this shopping center already have.  The service was prompt, the food was \"OK\" but could use an overhaul and should seem fresher.  The ambiance needs some serious adjustment.  I love the style of music that was playing, but I'd prefer some background Asian music instead for example."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place.  Although I got a great price on my sesame chicken combination platter with a coupon ($4.30 with tax, if I recall correctly), the dish was less than satisfying.  While they did give me very large portions, the Chinese food just cannot compete with restaurants like Wan Fu.  The inside is small and cramped.  I would only do take-out here."}
{"text":"Don't know where the folks with bad ratings are eating. There is no buffet. Food is fresh cooked and always great"}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars I would. Me and my family have been coming here for a long time...always order the same thing..orange chicken and always love it. That was..until yesterday. We went in with a party of 5 and we ordered 4 entrees of orange chicken (my little niece shared with me). From the moment it came out we knew it didmt look like it's always looked every other time. We all took a bite and none of us liked it. It didn't look or taste like it has all the other precious times. It wasnt good at all. The fried wonton that came with it was so burned it broke into several pieces when i tried to break it in half. Right away I went up to the server and asked her if they started making the orange chicken differently. She said no its always been this way. I said if been here so many times and always order the same and this is the first time it's looked or tasted like this. She said no its the same. I said im sorry but we really dont like it. She immediately gave me a dirty look and started talking to the other workers in a language I didnt understand and they all gave me dirty looks. I said mam you can see we didn't eat more than a bite. She said well you ordered it so you pay for it. I said we cant order something else instead of pay for something we didn't eat? She turned around and started speaking another language to the others again and went into the kitchen. I went and sat back down. She comes out of the kitchen and over to our table and says no you ordered 4 of the orange chicken so you pay for what you order. I told her again we didn't like the way it tasted and it didn't even look like how it looked every other time.  She said well next time you have to ask for the orange chicken to be like in balls not like this. I said if never had to do that before so im a little confused. She said sorry but you have to do that next time. I said o there wont be a next time after going through this. She goes to the register and comes back with my check while 2 other workers are standing around her slightly behind like i was going to walk out without paying...for the food we didn't eat. I paid because i didnt want to cause a problem and walked out crying. We had to go pick up drive thru food because everyone was still hungry but i couldn't afford another restaurant bill. Me and my family live on my social security disability check and I take them out once a month for lunch when i get my check. I was so upset I couldn't even eat after that. I will never go back. Never in my life have I been treated like that."}
{"text":"Best China? Booooooo......I went here against my better judgement. Lunch ended at 3. Ok. I get that. So I get chicken and vegs for 10$. No egg roll. Extra for that. Really??!!!. Unbelievable this place is still open, I feel I just got robbed. Next time I will go to Harris Teeter and get Chinese there!!! Never again."}
{"text":"I would come in on my lunch break at work and as soon as I placed my order at the front, I would only have about a 10 minute wait for my food. They are extremely fast and the you get a good amount of food for the prices. The food is great, & their shrimp and lobster sauce is my absolute favorite. I love this place, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for great food and great service."}
{"text":"Since I go here at least once a week for lunch, I can honestly say that this place is no more than 3.5 stars . It's not bad for shopping strip Chinese, but they make no effort to be any better than that. This place will never have a special of the day, or get creative with the menu at all. They did just recently remodel the restaurant so at least it's not gross like it used to be."}
{"text":"Best China lives up to their name. Seriously so good. It was fresh and full of flavor. I'll be back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely horrible.  Why, for the fact I was one of 3 other patrons eating and service was slow as molasses.  I ordered some wings and pork fried rice.  The wings were frozen straight to the fryer no flavor.  The rice was the bottom of the pot scrapped up to make a plate.  I even spoke to the attendant mentioning the food is bland and taste old.  I was truly disappointed in spending my money here.   Take your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it never fails to impress me. The entire setup of the inside is great! The food is affordable for everyone and it's not pricey. The orange chicken is my favorite along with the delicious shrimp fried rice ! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food looked good until I got into it a bit.  I ordered the shrimp broccoli the shrimp was good sized and the broccoli was cooked ok, but my meal was swimming in OIL.  When the waitress asked how everything was I showed her the oil separating away from the brown sauce and she said something like \" that only happens with the broccoli because of the way it has to be cooked.  Made no sense to me, but it really made me lose my appetite.  My husband ordered shrimp and vegetables.  They were out of pea pods and so he asked for carrots.  I tried one of his carrots because he didn't think they tasted right and he was right.  They tasted very sour and bitter.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"It used to be named Good China. The food is pretty decent not great but not bad.I have been there three times and have had no problem. Other's review seem low but it is good and fills you up."}
{"text":"Horrible food! I was in town for the weekend, I decided to go try this Chinese food place,instead of eating Subway and I regret it!  The food was disgusting,I got sick. Never again, the only good thing? The Fortune cookie.."}
{"text":"Very quick service - perhaps two quick. I had been asked tree times, by two different people, within five minutes of arriving if I was able to order immediately upon placing my order they brought out the soup that came with my meal.  The chicken with garlic sauce combination dinner I ordered came out in short order. I must admit that when I go out for Chinese healthy tends to be low on my priority list. But this dish had a good chicken to vegetable ratio making it a little higher on the healthy scale without making me feel like I wasted a cheat meal on veggies . It came with an egg roll and crab puff that didn't require a microscope to find the crab.  I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"This is one of 4 Best Chinas in Metro Charlotte. This one has been voted as one of the top 100 Chinese restaurants in the country the past two years by critics and consumers. They also received a perfect score on a blind visit from one of the critics. They opened right around the time we moved to Fort Mill, and we go at least every couple of weeks, and sometimes more often. This is the only location to have recently switched from serving large, dinner size portions, to smaller, but less expensive dinner combos. That being said, most dinner combos are still a healthy size and include rice and a egg roll or crab rangoon for about $6. They also put out coupons everywhere, so we usually have a complete meal including tip and drinks for about $15-16 for two people.   The food quality is very good, the service is very friendly, and they actually serve the best iced tea I have ever had.  The dine-in area is nice with carpeted floors and nice ceiling fans.  Their sanitation grades are also always good: http://www.scdhec.gov/health/envhlth/food_protection/scores_results.asp?results  This really is a hidden gem.  I have been to the one in Matthews too and that one was also very good.  The menu lacks some Americanized dishes, so don't come here forr egg foo yung or chop suey."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in Concord/Harrisburg area.  Chicken wings and scallion chicken are the best things on the menu."}
{"text":"This review is based on the orange chicken I had for take out. I have never been inside the restaurant. However, the orange chicken is amazing! The best I have ever had. It is different than most orange chicken as it is not too sweet and does not have a n obnoxious amount of sauce on it. It was the perfect combination of crunchy with minimal sauce. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Had the kung pao chicken dinner combo and my companion had the chicken lo mein combo.  I liked the egg rolls, and the kung pao, the fried rice was boring.  The egg drop soup was a little bland.  My companion liked his lo mein and states he would come me back.  They do serve alcohol including some spirits so that is a plus for us."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food. Had the curry chicken and a noodle dish. Four stars because one of the brown sauces in the dish were a bit too sweet, but I guess some folks like it like that...overall good food, friendly staff, and quick service."}
{"text":"Food was good service was a little off  After some confusion We got our order corrected. And the food was delicious. Give this restaurant 4 stars"}
{"text":"2nd time here. Not impressed. Brought my asian girlfriend and she said we are not allowed to come back."}
{"text":"I place a pick up order and was told 20 min.  I get there 20 minutes later and my order still wasn't ready, understandable as people get behind and I don't expect food to be exactly on time.. however that 20 minutes turned into an HOUR. No apology. No complimentary drink. No nothing."}
{"text":"Horrible everything from customer service to the food $30 of horrible Asian wasted away in fridge until I tossed it out. Don't come here unless u feel like feeding your dog something fancy. Not worth my time for any more words than that."}
{"text":"Best China was my neighborhood Chinese restaurant for years. I loved this place!  It's not a fancy place, but a little nicer than most of the \"hole in the wall\" Chinese restaurants you see in strip malls.  The staff was always super friendly to me, and very accommodating.  My favorite dish was the Sa-Cha Chicken. Strips of white chicken breast in a mildly spicy brown sauce, stir fried with zucchini, mushrooms, baby corn, water chestnuts, and carrots, and served with rice. Sooooo good, and the dinner portion was quite large.  I've been there many, many times, and always found the food quality to be consistently good."}
{"text":"Delicious!! I love their combination dinner! Everything is soooo good. I got shrimp Lo mein with fried rice, an egg roll, a crab puff and egg drop soup. It was all super tasty and I love that you can all of that in one meal. The service is also very nice. I wish I lived in town to come here more often!!"}
{"text":"this was the most horrifyingly bad restaurant I have been to in quite a long time.  I was wanting some good Chinese food and was in the Charlotte area, so I checked my geoqupons and checked Yelp (this place got 4 stars) and off we went.  First off, they did not accept the coupon, said it had to be printed out, get with the program and join the 21st Century.  Now let's get to the food, the dumplings were huge sure, but that was just because they were coated in so much dough that the meager fillings were barely able to be found.  The Hunan Beef, described as spicy, was weak with barely a hint of bite and the Cashew Chicken is at best a bit of dishwater with a few nuts thrown in.  The fried rice was flavourless as well, and the only hint that it was even fried were a few sparse bits of egg.  The prices were low but I still felt completely ripped off as it wasted my time to even go there in the first place.  As a final straw, before we left, the waiter mistook my boyfriend's iced tea for water and topped it off accordingly.  Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"OK first of all a combination dinner plate of mongolian beef cost me $11.95 when in the menu they serve combination dinners for $8.95 I paid $12 for Mongolian beef that's unbelievable,this place is not to die for.  I ate a few bites and was too upset to even eat the darn thing- WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN! Their holier than thou! Shame on you Good China or Best China get your name straight it's different on your sign it's Good China  and on the website it's Best China and now your charging combination dinners that's supposed to be cheaper than the entrées more then your entrées which was 9 bucks and some change."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the Harrisburg area. The orange chicken is awesome. Their lo mein noodles are always cooked perfectly and never overdone. You get a ton of good quality food for your money."}
{"text":"Love this place. I have been going here since I was 15. Today, during lunch I was served my a very nice young woman and I had an L3 Pork Lo Mein, rice, egg roll, soup and Dr.Pepper for like $8.85. Super filling. Which is funny as at dinner you get the same meal for like 5 dollars more. Would likely recommend visiting for lunch."}
{"text":"Color me shocked, but this is at least \"Pretty Good China\" (though not OMG AMAZING CHINA).  At the end of a lone strip mall in Harrisburg, I stopped in one Saturday night with my family in tow (chinese is always a treat for us when we're all rarely together). Feeling very \"Chinese restaurant in a strip mall\", we were seated and waited on by a tall Asian gentleman whose motto was obviously \"be seen but not heard\" - cool with me, though hard to ask questions! Booths and tables are abundant here, so I'd be shocked if there was ever a wait and it seemed the take out business was booming here. Mom and I always love the spicy, while my brother and sister always do the ol' standby meals, so we got a great sampling of what Best China could do.  Mom and I split the crab ragoons and these were my personal highlight. Crisp, lots of \"crab\", and a great tangy duck sauce all made for these babes to rock our taste buds.  I had the General Tofu extra spicy and was impressed that it really WAS extra spiced. A nice fry, a bit too much sauce and enough tofu to last for 3 meals. Portions are huge here! Mi madre had the General Chicken and ate almost every bite (quite the feat for a 5 foot tall, 100 lb woman!). Brother and sister had the sesame chicken and sweet and sour chicken, respectively. Both were really good - quality, good sauce, good flavors, huge portions.  With a few Best Chinas around town, I'd definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"This is by far the most delicious Chinese food I have had in a long long time. From Greensboro to Charlotte, I have dined at over a dozen different Chinese restaurants, and BEST CHINA is truly the BEST!!! We had a fantastic variety including Mongolian beef, chicken and mushrooms, mapu tofu, lobster with ginger sauce, steamed talapia, and terriaki beef. The atmosphere was very pleasant and casual and the service was most excellent."}
{"text":"By far the best lemon chicken I have had in years. Large portions, fast service and plenty left over. Just wish they delivered, but I don't live that far away so it's ok"}
{"text":"Had not been to Best China in years.  Returned to have a super delicious meal.  Service was great.  Enjoyed the Poo poo platter, shrimp fried rice, and Lomain.  The portions were very generous and the price was very reasonable.  I am sure we will return again soon."}
{"text":"Had a delicious late lunch/early dinner here last week with a companion. (Around 4 or 5 p.m.)  I've been searching for good Chinese food in Charlotte for many years. I've found a few and I'm happy to add this one to the list.  We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken and brought out right away.  (We ordered hot tea.)  For our meal, I had the shrimp egg foo yung. My companion ordered moo goo gai pan. (Which I have often seen on menus but never knew what it was.)  The portion sizes were great. Mine more so as I actually had enough for a few meals with the leftovers.   The meal came with white sticky rice. Upon request, we were given additional rice to go.  The restaurant itself is tucked away in a strip mall with a Harris Teeter and a few other businesses. The decor is nice (booths with tall padded seat backs). The cloth napkins take the atmosphere up a notch.  Our server (a tall older Asian gentleman with a serious face) was dressed in a white jacket, white shirt, and black slacks. That also helped elevate the atmosphere.  But the place is not at all stuffy feeling.   Several people came in for take out while we were eating. Seems to be a popular place.  My only issue is that it's in an area I don't frequent.    *sigh*"}
{"text":"Best Chinese around my house! This one and the one in Stevens Mill are my favorite! I like the scallion chicken and hot and sour soup"}
{"text":"First time coming here, and it definitely won't be the last.  Everything was delicious, and the service was friendly and on point.  I wish I'd known about them sooner, because the places I've been going to in the area haven't been up to par.  But, now I know!  We ate in tonight, but I'm looking forward to getting their take out, as well."}
{"text":"PEANUT WARNING!!!!!!! Overall this was a great restaurant.  Until finding out that there egg rolls area sealed with PEANUT BUTTER!!! I am allergic and had a weird feeling the last time I ate here.  So I went back with some favor and thought I would try again.  The server then told me the egg rolls contained peanut butter and told me the egg rolls were fried with all the other foods. But if you are not allergic this is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Mike, the man of few words, pretty much nailed this one.  We happened to be on the other side of 485 (wrong side of the tracks?  You make the call) and decided to stop in.  Even at prime eating hours (lunch time), they were fairly empty, which could be a sign of a bad experience.  The service was prompt, which is to be expected, since no one was there eating.  The food looked good, and it wasn't bad - it just wasn't outstanding.  I don't know if we'll make the trip again.  Just too far out of the way.  If we're there, we may stop.  Otherwise, probably not.  Mostly things were just a bit too heavy on the sauce - there was a nice light sauce on one of the chicken servings, but it was lacking in flavor."}
{"text":"This is always the go-to place when my family wants Chinese food. Food is always good, some times are better than others, but nothing too much to complain about. I usually stick to the fried rice or the chicken and broccoli. Sweet and sour chicken and orange chicken is good too. The sizzling rice soup is always a must for the family, and their wontons are great! The spring rolls are not my favorite, but they're tolerable. Can't really go wrong with anything on the menu.  We always pick up the food and bring it home and it's ready within ten to fifteen minutes. Super fast and super easy and that's why we love it.  It took them a long time to get new menus when they changed owners and the fact that they just crossed out Good and wrote Best was really, really bad and made them look SO cheap. Not like it really matters to me because I went there when it was Good China and I could care less if they changed names or not, but for new people it would have been a little weird. My family always had a good laugh about it, and we continue to go back because we love Chinese."}
{"text":"Dine or take out, always delicious!  I stick with the pork fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, lettuce wraps and crab puffs.  Always very good...  My one \"vent\"...if you order the lunch special before 3pm, but pick it up at 3:01pm they will charge you full price and not the original lunch special price.  In my opinion, it should stay lunch special price if ordered before 3pm regardless if you pick it up at 3:07pm.  I think it's a culture thing, but definitely NOT good business!"}
{"text":"this place has great lunch specials! They also give you a lot of food. I don't think i've ever finished my whole plate. Its also another place that is minutes from my house. They're also very quick; pickup and delivery. I love their dumplings, they're huge!"}
{"text":"This isn't the worst food I've ever had but it definitely wasn't the best. I ordered chicken lo mein and it was pretty tasteless and very greasy. The egg roll wasn't much better and the fried rice was also tasteless. The server didn't speak much English and never came back to the table after taking the order except to bring it. Oh I forgot to mention that there were 9 of us. Poor service & mediocre food."}
{"text":"This place is located in a sketchy shopping center but I have been coming here for 10 yrs. I love the staff and foods quality has never gone down. You get a lot of food for your money and they have a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was very young with my family back when it was good China. Now my boyfriend and I are regulars. The food is always fresh and sooo good. The plates can feed up to 3 people! Prices can't be beat. Recommendations: shrimp fried rice, orange chicken, egg drop soup, Mongolian beef, sugar donuts (usual items that we order)"}
{"text":"It looks really neat. Has attentive service. A cocktail menu, even.   But I'm not that excited.   This is pretty basic as far as Chinese restaurants go around here. Either get a combination plate that's like 80% noodles, or enjoy the worthwhile entrees a la carte, with relatively pricey sides. I also believe they choose to make their sauces as safe and bland as possible. Hot mustard that isn't hot. Sauces that would normally use garlic, chili, onions, etc. are rather plain. My sesame chicken looked very presentable, but was just fried chicken on a bed of honey syrup. The fried rice was quite boring as well.   It's by the 101 and open on major holidays like Christmas, so I'd probably try it once more in a pinch."}
{"text":"The name says it all... BEST CHINA RESTAURANT I have ever been too!! My favorite dish is their orange chicken.. Not the typical orange chicken we are all used to.. No, this is hands down the BEST orange chicken ever. Sesame chicken and singapore noodles are also delish!! I 100% recommend this place! The service has improved tremendously since the first time we went a year ago... I hope you all enjoy it as much as my family and I do!!"}
{"text":"This is hands-down my favorite Chinese restaurant. I crave the Orange Chicken on a regular basis! I've done take out and dine in and have always had great service. The staff is always helpful and kind and offer suggestions and will even tell you if you are ordering too much for your table! Haha! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and have tried everything from Beef and Broccoli to the Lemon Chicken. The restaurant was called Good China when we first visited and the food was pretty good at that time. The Lemon chicken was the first thing we tried and it was great. Chicken was crunchy, yet moist and juicy inside and the lemon sauce was marvelous. Today the lemon chicken seems to be dry and overcooked. Lemon sauce is still great. You don't get as much chicken as we got the first time we had it. Pork Egg Foo-Yun is just average. Nothing like it is back east in NY or Boston. There's no brown tasty sauce and the pork it thrown on top of the egg instead of cooked inside it seems. Lots of veggies and mushrooms are added on top as well. I do like the sauce, but the egg itself is not the greatest. Best thing at this restaurant may be the Beef & Broccoli. The beef is tender and juicy and the broccoli is crunchy and tasty. It's great. The worse thing has to be the chicken wings. You don't even get the whole wing. It's cut into awkward pieces and it's just dry and not flavorful. Just terrible. Also the Egg Drop Soup has to be the worse I've ever tasted. There was a place in Cambridge, MA that I would get my Egg Drop Soup and it was outstanding. Bursting with flavor and taste. The service is hit or miss. I asked for sweet & sour sauce after getting my food and the woman screamed, \"Why didn't you ask for it when you ordered?\" I told her Sweet and Sour sauce should automatically be given with your food just like Soy Sauce. She obviously didn't agree. Told me I needed to ask for it in advance the next time. Apparently they want to charge you extra for it or something. In any case, this is still a decent place to get some Chinese Food. We haven't found any Asian place that is as good as the places in NY or Boston yet. They just don't compare. We are going to try Yan's next as it has gotten a lot of great reviews from customers.  Update 1/15/17 Got to try the Beef Noodle Soup which was very good. You get lots lots of noodles and a decent amount of beef, vegetables and soup. I would say add a little more beef and veggies and a little less noodles. It comes in a big contain and it's only $6.95. Also the BBQ Ribs are great. Plenty of red BBQ  sauce and the meat on the bone is juice and tasty. I was actually surrprised at how good they were. Nothing changes much on the other items I've tried. Chicken wings are still bad."}
{"text":"My go-to neighborhood Chinese place!  The food is always good, fresh, and ready pretty fast! And it's so inexpensive for the heaping mounds of food you get!  Dine in or carry out, everyone is courteous and friendly. There's a gentleman working there that is ALWAYS refilling my drink about halfway, which I love.  The portions are ridiculous. Like enough for a lunch for two the next day. If you sit down for dinner, you either need a doggy bag or a body bag on the way out..."}
{"text":"We only do take out. The service is fast and the food is good. We usually get the veg. fried rice & veg. lo mein along with some egg rolls & I really enjoy their hot & sour soup. You can walk out for under $15 with a coupon which they put on every take out menu. We live in the area  (definitely don't consider it the wrong side of the tracks) and when we want a quick & easy Chinese meal we call Best China. These other yelpers are right, they do give you huge portions. We have leftovers for lunch for a couple of days. All and all pretty darn good & great value!"}
{"text":"Looks like alot of the reviews are old.  The food was good, and for a quick Chinese meal it is great."}
{"text":"Great great food. This location is same owners but new management they have American waitstaff with Chinese chefs.  The food is absolutely amazing and service is great.  Highly recommended Chinese and would encourage anyone who reads this its a must try"}
{"text":"Come here for lunch and sometimes dinner. Waitress Ashley is wonderful and the food is great"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. Personally the food has never blown me away."}
{"text":"This place is decent. Never really sat down to eat here but had always ordered for a to go. I haven't tried all but so far the few that my family typically orders is pretty good. The families favorite is the Mongolian beef.  They are also quick to getting the food ready. It'll probably take them about 10-15minutes."}
{"text":"Cold food! Never brought the normal condiments & at the end of the meal, no fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Brought some friends here to have dinner. The server appeared to be the only one here.  We all ordered a mixture of things, seseme chicken, orange chicken and tofu veggie plate.  The server was nice, seemed that he wanted to use as less conversation with us as possible. But eh, dunno if he was just tired or what. He was the only person in the front at the time.  Food we got was average for a china place. The plates were bountiful and mixed veggies. My husband ordered sesame chicken and it appears that he got like 1/2 of the food (volume) than I did.  We ordered the crab rangoon as a starter. Great, and normal crab plate.  Overall. It was good, pretty pricy for the plate, but I believe if the service was better or friendlier it would have make for a better experience."}
{"text":"Currently sick to my stomach after eating this a few hours ago. Way too much sauce on the \"chicken\", noodles were dry, not sure what meat is even used in the egg roll because it was pink meat. My mother ordered food with me and she wouldn't even hardly eat hers because she thought it was so gross, and she is also feeling sick to her stomach. Will not be back. Customer service is also not the best here."}
{"text":"Best orange chicken I've had in a while. Love how it's thin and crunchy and the flavor is perfect not to spicy but more then other places that I've been to. Nice staff always have my order ready quick usually order for three people and only takes 10 minutes always fresh never had a bad experience at this place."}
{"text":"I eat at a ton of different Chinese food restaurants all the time. This place is my absolute favorite. I haven't ever had a bad experience here and I have loved every dish that I have tried. Great Shrimp with lobster, egg drop soup, wonton soup, and chop suey. Yum!"}
{"text":"So Scott S. from Jamestown, NC ate here the same day we did. I think he must have gotten the name of his restaurant mixed up because the food we had was horrifying.  The hot sour soup was the only acceptable item.  The sweet and sour chicken was nothing more than frozen chicken nuggets with red Elmers glue.  The fried dumplings were soggy and tasted like plastic. The teriyaki beef was sour, like it had spoiled. The chicken cashew was strange. Again the flavors were all wrong. I would pass on this one."}
{"text":"Been coming here before hockey games for years.   Food is good, served quickly and service is friendly and attentive. Restrooms could use a re-do or it would by a 5 stars."}
{"text":"Probably the closest Chinese place to my parent's house.  The place is usually not too busy, but it is always fast and the food is always hot and fresh.  Tried the chef's special Lemon Chicken with vegetable fried rice.   Pretty decent, but pretty heavily breaded and fried chicken (warning for those of you watching what you eat).  It's nice that they separated out the lemon sauce so the chicken stays nice and crispy until you drench it before eating.  Overall it was a decent meal... probably a little overpriced considering the lack of competition around Stallings, but I did order a Chef specialty so I should look at the regular fair and base my price judgement on those items (for next time).  My fortune wasn't that great and the cookie seemed to be pretty crispy. Maybe the fortune should have read, \"you will be needing a dentist real soon\".  I kid, but man the meal ending note was a bit hard to swallow in more than one way."}
