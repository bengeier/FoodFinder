{"text":"Where to begin? It's not Thai it's not Californian...  It's one of those order your food at the counter and seat yourself venues.   Counter lady was nice enough. Prices and portions were good as well.   When it comes down food, well I ordered the pad Thai with chicken. I'm a pad Thai eating fool and let me tell you this was not pad Thai. It did not look, taste, or smell like pad Thai.   This was a botched attempt at it. I should have known better after realizing the operators were not Thai, which is ok as long as they get it right. If it's good it's made with tamarind, if its ok its made with tomato sauce, this was definitely neither and tasted like noodles fried with soya sauce.   The dish it self was not awful, just very very very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of trying something other than my trusted yellow curry here. I had the mango stir fried shrimp with rice. They dumped SO MUCH sauce it overflowed onto the food tray under my plate. I couldn't even taste the shrimp and veggies. Next time I'll order my meal with my sauce on the side and pour at my own will."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night. I had always passed it and wanted to stop by, so I did with three friends. I wish I hadn't.  The decor was nice, and we were seated right away. We decided to order the Spring Roll Platter ($10) that was supposed to have four different types of spring rolls on it. When it arrived, we thought they got our order wrong. It was a big pile of mango salad, with about 4 spring rolls cut in half. Not only were there only two kinda (chicken and shrimp curry?) but it was less spring roll platter and more mango salad with a side of spring rolls. We were really disappointed.   When the meals came, it was worse. I ordered a peanut pad thai, and it looked like something someone threw up. It was really gloppy and....gross. I ended up not finishing it. My friends were less than plussed with their food, although the stif fried rice seemed to be the best thing on the table.  The price and service was ok, but the food is terrible. That was the first and last time I would ever eat there again."}
{"text":"It was very promising after I ordered the Vegetarian Noodles in Tom Yum Soup... They cooked it right in front of me, packed it nicely so I could take it to go, the bowl was also pretty big so the portion was definitely good. But as I unwrapped it and started to dig in, I found a piece of tin looking foil thing in my soup... HELLOOOOO??!!?  (uploaded a picture of it too)"}
{"text":"A great place for a change from your typical stir fried Asian cuisine.  It's clean, but a bit bare inside.  I usually take my food to go.  The prices are quite reasonable for the quality of the food plus you get good sized servings -- one meal can feed two people unless you have a huge appetite.  Their pad thai is ok, but their beef and noodles are really good.  Much better food and quantity for the price compared to Thai Express."}
{"text":"Not sure how this restaurant got such good reviews.  As far as Thai food goes, it really isn't much better than any food court restaurants you'd find in a mall.  Definitely not authentic Thai.    I had the green curry, which was just average.  The portion size was good however so at least I didn't leave feeling hungry.  Even so, don't think I will be going back again.  There are much better options in town for good Thai food."}
{"text":"California Thai is in the Toronto Life Square food court above Future Shop, and the outlet beside it, called Caribbean Queen or something, are clearly the same food though they do try to hide it.  One side (CT) has green T-shirts and black hats, and the other (Caribbean... ) has orange T-shirts and white hats (or is it the other way around.  Anyway, they both employ pleasant young Chinese girls to serve the food.  After reading the other reviews I hesitate to admit that I enjoy the food there.  I usually go to the CT side because they have the tofu and eggplant as a veg.  So I have maybe the chicken or whatever else strikes my fancy, with the tofu as a veg, and Pad Thai noodles.  Total $7, cant beat that for generous portions."}
{"text":"I have passed by this fast food counters many times but usually after the lunch rush. When I saw that they had fresh mango slices as a choice side salad, I made a bee line to make my order. This fast food counter boasts a large selection of meat, vegetable, and sea food dishes.  You can pick one meat item with noodles or rice with one or two veggie/salad selections.  I opted for the one meat with noodle and a veggie and a salad combo...the damage was $8.13 tax included.  What makes this fast food place so unique is the vast selection. You have the choice of fried rice, pad thai noodles, california thai noodles (egg noodles), and glass noodles.  I opted for the California thai noodles stir fried with green onions and bean sprouts.  From the meats, you have a large variety of chicken and beef...from curry chicken to bourbon chicken, to sweet and sour chicken/beef. I opted for the green curry chicken with veggies.  For the vegetable options, you can pick from a brocoli medley, a zucchini/mushroom/celery/carrot mix, green beans. There is also tofu, and fried tofu puffs with eggplant.  For seafood, you have spicy shrimp or white fish in batter.  I opted for the zucchini/mushroom medley.  As for the salads, you can choose romaine lettuce or mango strips. I opted for the mango - is there any other choice?!  The noodles, veggies, and chicken curry were good...not mindblowing but decent, but the best part of the meal was the side mango slices which would most likely cost $3 if you were to get them from the marketplace buffet where they charge by the weight.  It was a refreshing side option which you do not find anywhere else in the downtown food courts. Just for that alone, it is worth ordering from this joint."}
{"text":"good service, quick for the most part given they are making stuff fresh.  Good food though the soup is not my fav. Love the ho fun noodles."}
{"text":"Oh My God! Don't even bother...the worst food ever. Nothing Thai tasting, the noodles are just soy sauce and some vegetable. The spicy chicken, meh! The spring roll is a joke. Waste of money."}
{"text":"This restaurant had an interesting concept of Asian fusion cooking. But the last time we were here the quality dropped. You could tell that there was a change of managent. The food is bland and I am not sure what to call it now since it is not Asian. Plus they don't have the soft shell crab with spicy coconut sauce anymore which I really enjoyed. So another place where I will stop coming."}
{"text":"A decent and quick way to get Thai food.  The flavours are not perfect, but they are perfectly adequate if you want something quick!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times now. I am a Hong Kong Chinese so my taste is 100% pure Chinese yet I found the food here is very  very tasty. I always lick  the plate clean so I don't know why Jennifer and Amanda have such bad reviews. Perhaps they have changed cook recently?  I have no complaint over the food or the price and there is NO MSG cause I don't get thirsty like I normally would after dining at a Chinese restaurant.  I am just worry this restaurant will not last long . There are never more than two tables full whenever I go . It closes at 7pm on Saturday. What restaurant would close at 7 on a weekend???  I think their biggest problem is the poorly designed lighting. This place always look 'closed' from the outside. They only hire ONE person to act as the host, the waiter, the bus boy..........as if the owner don't expect more than two tables at a time. I bet their business will increase if they do something about the lighting."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a quick taste of fusion Thai and Chinese then California Thai is a great stop for you. My favourite is the Golden Pad Thai with a little extra spice. The Sweet Mango Chicken is a good pick as well as commented by another reviewer.  The food is consistently food and service is good for a fast-food type joint.  Last but not least, the prices are really good considering the portion size."}
{"text":"I find the food truly delicious. It's a great place for quick pickup. Even though it is a bit pricey in my opinion, it is pretty worth it considering the propprtions. Eating at the restaurant is more expensive but the place looks great and the atmosphere is awesome! The only downfall for me is price. Kids though might find the place slightly boring. I find this place to be a good place to have social dinners because it is fairly roomy and the interior looks awesome. Overall a great place!"}
{"text":"Got the shrimp pad thai today.  Huge portion for $9.26 after tax.  Very filling and tasty.  Delicious blend of flavours and amazing staff on hand."}
{"text":"They say insanity is repeating an action and expecting a different result - so I might have been off my rocker to come back to California Thai in Beacon Hill. But I felt like Wor Won Ton soup and I didn't feel like getting a second mortgage to eat at nearby Mucho Burrito. As soon as I took my first sip of the wan, cafeteria grade broth, garnished with frozen shrimp ring quality shrimp, I instantly remembered why I swore I'd never come back... The service was so brusque that I think the full to the brim tip jar may be one of the biggest mysteries in the known universe... I don't tip for \"extra rude\" service. For the quality of food it's definitely not cheap ... My table was sticky with the residue of 100 other disappointing meals and the joyless stark and utilitarian interior serves as an instant buzz kill. Not recommended..."}
{"text":"Having been to Thailand and experienced authentic Thai food and enjoying cooking it myself at home, I am always skeptical of Thai restaurants.  I was starving when I went to California Thai to grab a late lunch.    I was torn about what to try.  I decided on the cashew chicken with steamed rice, since I was in need of some veggie sustenance.  The guy working was very nice, he had a big smile on his face the whole time I was talking to him.  It cost me $8 for my food, $2 for my drink.  The prices were mostly in the $6 to $8 range across the board.  An older man made my food fresh in one of their big woks, I waited about 10 minutes.  As I watched him fill my take out container, I couldn't help but be impressed by the huge portion size of my order!    Once home, again I was impressed with how much food I had to eat!  I decided to share with my Hubby, there was enough for both of us to be content.  I can't say I was swept off my feet with my cashew chicken.  It lacked flavour.  The chicken was really good and the veggies fresh though.  It was definitely missing my beloved chilies, there was no spice what so ever.  I would return to California Thai to try something else, the ingredients are fresh.  I just hope whatever I try next has more flavour to it.  Its a place to check out for fast and fresh Thai food."}
{"text":"California Thai is my son's FAVORITE place to eat.  He loves the Ho Fun noodles (thick rice noodles with oyster sauce).  The serving is plentiful and he & I usually share it.  I also really like their mango salad.  Try the option\"with meat\".  I think it's so funny that they don't actually tell you what it is on the menu.  When I got it, the meat was BBQ chicken.  Honestly it's some of the best chicken I've ever had.  So good!  The staff is always friendly and often remembers who we are & what we order.  While I don't consider this very authentic Thai food & their selection is a bit limited, it is definitely the best option in Beacon Hill which is why we go back again an again."}
{"text":"I must've went to this place on an off-day after seeing positive reviews on here.  My vegetables were edible but my red curry beef did not taste fresh and the consistency was too gloopy for my taste.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Not Thai and not Californian ethier....not sure what it really is?  Service was okay, but then again all I did was tell the cashier what I wanted. She wasn't overly friendly but was fine. Took my order. What more can I want?  Ran in to order a couple things to go. Arrived after regular lunch time, so no line up and no one inside. I thought this was perfect but learned 15 minutes later, that's never a good sign....  Ordered chicken fried rice and small won ton soup to go. Paid and then sat and waited....and waited.  Soup came out and then I was told the rice would be out in 10 minutes or so? Didn't really understand why they would bring my soup out to sit on the counter till the rice was ready? Who wants cold soup?  Rice finally arrived and then on route to my home to enjoy a great lunch. Let's hope.  First off, soup was beyond cold. Couldn't heat it up in the microwave when it's in a plastic container? Sadly i had to put it in a pot and warm it up.Fail. That didn't help since the taste of the broth was horrible. No idea why it tasted so strange but something was off. So deceided to skip the broth and eat the meat and veggies. They also had the same taste but also some sort of strange film. YUCK! Off to the garbage.  As for the fried rice, it wasn't bad but it surely wasn't great ethier. The carrots were all burnt and some of the rice was stiff too. So I ate around all the not so great parts. Which left me hungry since most of it was like that.  Lunch was not worth the wait. I would compare it to \"not as good as food court food\". Scary but true. Wouldn't attempt this place again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a number of times and think it's a completely average Thai chain. If you're in the mall and in the mood for something slightly better than what's in the food court, this is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Came here before heading to the amc for a movie- I ordered the fried rice with mango chicken and mixed veg- it was ok. If I hadn't felt so sick afterwards I'd probably give it a 3.5 for being a fun movie theatre sneak in food, not too bad tasting and generous servings. But I did feel sick afterwards- I'm not sure if it was the amount of oil and sugar in the meal- or a mild case of food poisoning, but I'll have to give it a two for the tummy ache."}
{"text":"We are slowly but surely knocking off all the little NW places to try for eats. Last night we stopped by California Thai for a quick bite. Very bright restaurant with seating but it was quite clear to me walking in that this was \"fast food thai\". Still the food is cooked to order and I am alllll about the freshness. The menu featured 6-7 items only which can be good for quality control. I tried the pad thai and asked for extra spicy. The nice woman behind the counter asked me out of 10 how hot I wanted it. I said 8. She kind of gave me that, \"Are you sure look? I said, \"OK well I like it hot but how about a 7 then?\" Satisfied with that, she took my husbands order and he got the green curry chicken on rice. The food was ready in under 10 minutes. My pad thai was OK. Nowhere near spicy in any way, shape or form. A bit disappointing. My only other complaint was that there was too much sauce on it, making it slick and not good and sticky. I did like the fact that on the side they have peanuts and lime to dress your dish yourself. The other dish, the green curry was very good and was VERY loaded into a take out container that will feed M for 2 meals. Half of it is still in the fridge!  The rice had good texture, better than my noodles. Service seemed quite good, many customers came and went for take out and were recognized by staff and their orders were remembered from the last time they had come by. I would return here but my no means am I craving this particular pad thai. I would order something else and will make it a 10 on the heat scale. Price - just under $20 for 2 people - without drinks."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I've been coming here once a week for the past couple years. Not exactly authentic, but who cares. The food is delicious. The Pad Thai and Ho Fun noodles are the best I've had in Calgary. Big portions, fresh (you can see them prepping the vegetables in the kitchen), and it's cheap. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Apparently, I am a slow learner.  Last year I visited this place for lunch and ordered the pad thai with peanut sauce.  Extra peanutty pad thai!  How could this be a bad thing?  Picture a pound of rice noodles.  Picture a separate bowl.  Picture yourself emptying a jar of Skippy crunchy peanut butter into this bowl.  Then, add a can of coconut milk.  Then, add four cups of flavourless vegetable oil.  Blend.  Apply to the pound of rice noodles.  Remove flavour.  Serve.  Actually, I don't know the recipe, but I dare anyone to contradict me.  It was a mass of rice noodles, sitting despondently in this pale, thick, oozy, oily sauce.  I shuddered, dumped it, and moved on with my life.  What happens?  A year passes.  Memory fades.  Surely it was just that one dish?  I have two bites of a friend's amazing red curry (from another establishment), and I have a terrible jones for Thai.  I'm picturing a combo with red curry and pad thai.  How bad could California Thai be?  Even bad Thai is pretty good.    I head up to the eerily deserted counter and order combo #1 (under $6):  a rice/noodle selection, a veggie, and a meat.  I get the pad thai noodles, the tofu & thai eggplant, and some basil beef.  I taste all three.  Or, rather, I fail to taste all three.  My orange pad thai noodles are as innocent of flavour as my plastic fork.  The tofu & eggplant is disgusting; floppy, mushy ears of tofu bathing in oil, with a couple of slivers of equally bland eggplant.  Only the basil beef has any flavour; that flavour is salt.  I sigh at my gullibility, dump it and move on with my life.  Never again, ever, ever, ever ."}
{"text":"Plenty of 2 star reviews, mainly complaining about the name  Now I'm not an expert when it comes to Thai food. All I know is that I was hungry and the lady let me sample few of their meats and I personally liked the one in the picture below as it was juicy and unsweetened.  If you are looking for authentic Thai dishes then I suggest that you look somewhere else other than a food court!"}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place!   its one of those Fast Food Restaurants when your looking for Fresh, Hot, Cooked on the Spot, BIG Portions, Fast and not to mention DELICIOUS Food.  The Staff there working are so Friendly. Every time I go, they seem to know my order before i even make it! (I'm somewhat of a regular).  I really love their Fish Ho Fun Noodles, Fish Fried Rice or their Crispy, Juicy Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings.. I am Salivating just thinking about it XD  The price is very reasonable, especially for how much they give you and now I'm addicted to their Coffee Bubble Tea ^-^  Yummy!"}
{"text":"Fast-food thai food doesn't have to be this bad. The bubble tea is okay - nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"They recently added a new food court at North York City Centre.  California Thai is one fast food restaurants here.   Personally, I think it's a stretch to call this Thai food.  They do have some typical Thai items like Pad Thai and green curry, but for the most part this place is remarkably similar to the Manchu Wok on the other side of the food court.  Now, for the bad parts.  I found a piece of metal in my food.  It was attached to a piece of chicken.  Not cool.    I then kept the chicken in the original container.  I intended to bring it back and tell them about it.  I didn't get around to it.  After some time passed, we noticed that the chicken wasn't decomposing.  This turned into an office experiment.  It's now been three months and the \"chicken\" looks pretty much the same as it does when I bought it.    Maybe some deal I'll bring the chicken back and show them.  They'll probably just respond with a blank stare.  I'll definitely post pictures here though."}
{"text":"California Thai is part of the new food court in North York City Centre, its your typical \"Asian\" food that you would normally find in a food court.  I wouldn't go as far to call it Thai food but I guess whatever floats your boat...  Its acceptable if you are just looking for something quick and easy, depending on when you come the food may or may not be as fresh... who knows how long it has been sitting..."}
{"text":"There's a reason why there's always a long line at this vendor during lunchhour and the \"Chinese food\" vendor right next to it sits nearly empty - this is actually the best food-court \"Chinese food\" in Toronto (despite its name).  Moderately priced, wide selection, generous portions, greasy and delicious.  I always get the spicy fried tofu, and friends and coworkers usually always get that one too. It's like a flavor-sponge, and with each bite, it releases a squirt of the salty and savory soup it was soaked in. I actually sometimes get a three-item combo and get a double-portion of the tofu - it really is that good.  There's also a garlic grilled chicken that's delicious as well, although I'm not sure if it's always available. It isn't quite as well grilled as the chicken from the place in the middle of the food court that specializes in grilled meats, but it's pretty close, and you get more for your money  Take care that a three-item with rice likely contains close to a full-day's worth of calories, and it is salty and savory enough to make you want to finish the whole thing in one sitting. Probably shouldn't"}
{"text":"California Thai was kind of a surprise to find in the middle of the suburbs.  It's family run and owned and the owners are super friendly. The food is fresh and made fresh to order.  I got the yellow curry chicken and I couldn't even finish it. You'll get more than your money's worth for $10. I've had better curry before but for fast food, this was a great deal."}
{"text":"Quick and delicious food for really cheap prices! This is where I come if I'm in the mood for Thai! Another thing I love about this place is that they have a great variety of items you can choose from. I like this location better than the other ones as this location has the freshest food.   If your vegetarian ask them for Pad Thai with Eggplant tofu and Mango salad. If you like it spicy they have Hot sauce and peanuts next to their cash Register for you to modify the taste to your liking.   They are great for lunch (although they create an Assembly line feel, but that's what makes them quick!) and they are priced reasonably cheap. For around $7 I get a good filling vegetarian lunch! It's within Metro Hall Concourse close to Roy Thompson Hall, so I'm not certain if they are open past 6."}
{"text":"I'd actually been to California Thai a few years ago and I remember ordering one of their variations on Pad Thai and absolutely hating it. But this afternoon I found myself in the Yonge/Dundas food court and I thought surely it's not gonna be as bad as I remember. And sure enough, it wasn't as bad.  It was worse.  I ordered the Classic Pad Thai and waited probably a minute while it was prepared. An intimidatingly large portion comes packaged in a styrofoam container, which, at least, ensures the whole thing stays hot while you're eating it.  The first bite was an unmitigated disaster. I opened the container and was immediately slapped in the face with a smell that reminded me of stale fish. And that's what it tastes like, too.  This is a flavorless concoction that's just a complete salt bomb. There isn't a single flavor in here that reminded me of any version of Pad Thai I've ever had. (And I've had a lot of Pad Thai over the years.)  I managed to eat maybe a third of this trainwreck before I had to throw in the towel and toss what was left. And I'm a pig; I'll eat just about anything!  Worst. Pad Thai. Ever."}
{"text":"Tried out this restaurant at lunchtime today.  The restaurant has a mixture of Chinese, Thai and Californian cuisine.    We tried   1) the Ho Fun (Chinese wide rice noodles), cooked with beef and oyster sauce.  It was OK.    2) the Sweet Mango Chicken with pad thai noodles.  Really good chicken and the mango was a nice touch!  3) the Pad Thai Classic with Chicken - Really, really good!  This dish was quite nicely put together.  4) the Pad Thai Golden with Shrimp - Golden means curry flavour.  It was not too bad.  5) Wor Wonton Soup - lots of wontons in a nice clear broth with loads of veges.   Great little place to go if you're looking for food in the new Beacon Hill Centre.  Next time I go back, I'm going to try the Mango Salad with Santa Barbara Chicken - I wonder what that could taste like..."}
{"text":"Their quality has decreased a lot recently and they have raised their prices.  As other reviewers mentioned it's an Asian restaurant with very limited Thai selection."}
{"text":"Perhaps I came on an off day, or simply ordered the wrong thing, but the shrimp tom yum noodle soup I had could only be described as nasty, so much so that it took a couple of hours for me to get its bitter aftertaste out of my mouth.  Others have had better experience here, so I'm not going to write this place off completely, but for now I have to give this place 1*.  My meal here really was that bad.  (Plus, it really bothers me when the food I'm served doesn't resemble what was pictured on the menu.  If the photo shows broccoli and other veg in the soup, I fully expect it to be there!)"}
{"text":"Never judge a book by it's cover and in this case, never judge a restaurant by its name - in this case anyways. Neither truly Thai nor Californian, California Thai offers more of a fusion Canadian style fast, quasi-Chinese food.   I can't say the mango salad or the curries are remarkable or outstanding but I have more often than I care to admit ordered the beef ho fan and the Singapore curry fried noodles.  The general tso is also pretty good and the salt and pepper squid/seafood another often ordered item. While I can't say everything is the best, it's close, you get a lot for what you pay and it satisfies."}
{"text":"I didn't quite understand the place when I went here.  The decor was great and the place was clean. The service only had one guy on wait staff and they actually lost customers because he was out back while we were eating. I found it a little irksome and I would understand why people would leave.  The food made up for a lot of it. Loved the California Pad Thai and the Curry Pad Thai. Lovely dishes and I would make my way out to Markham to have it again. I just would order take out instead.  I would like to note that you should make the waitstaff aware of allergies. Peanuts are a given in Thai restaurants but they also serve their Pad Thai with Mushrooms as well."}
{"text":"I'm going with a lot of others opinion on this one... while neither Thai, nor Californian, the place is pretty good when compared to a fast food place.   It was 'ok', but not outstanding."}
{"text":"Came here with my big papa and mama dearest. It was snowing, so there was no one in the restaurant but us. We receive a warm welcome by the friendly owners.   The food was reasonably priced, and the portions were huge, without losing quality. We also received our food in under five minutes.   The place itself is small but there are plenty of places to sit. It was also very clean with a good use of space.   This is one of the best thai food experiences I have had in a while. Must try! (they also have a halal option)."}
{"text":"Typical Asian mall food. Greasy, mildly flavourful, quick service. Nothing great. Weird name. No Thai food on the menu."}
{"text":"Had the special with chicken and the chicken was very low quality. The sause was nothing too special either. Had it for dinner and it tasted like it was there all day."}
{"text":"Why would they use the word 'Thai' is beyond me. Save for a few minor variations this place is just like any other Chinese joint in any food court.  Nothing noteworthy warranting a detailed review."}
{"text":"California Thai is a welcome addition to the NW quick food scene.  I've been there a half dozen times and have always been satisfied.  Have tried their curries, ho fun, ginger beef (which was wonderfully crispy), and wonton soup.  Always fresh and cooked to order!  The portions are generous and very flavorful.    While its AWESOME they have their menu online (honestly, is it that difficult for even the smallest indy restaurant to have this???) my only comment (complaint?) is that their selections are different then the \"main\" California Thai site.  Not sure if the Calgary location is a franchise or just using the same name but the main site has a bunch of dishes I would like to try."}
{"text":"California Thai has a few locations in Canada. This one is inside Markville Mall right next to Walmart.  The deco is nice and trendy with comfortable sofas and private sectional area for 2.  I went there for lunch. They have all day special for $7.99 which includes pop/tea/coffee. There are also a la Carte with Pho priced at $6.95.  I ordered the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with Chicken. The Tom Yum soup I found was too weak, not hot, not sour... a little bland. There were tons of fresh tomato they put in the soup, so I kind of feel like drinking a tomato soup instead. The noodle is the dry thin rice noodles.. of course I prefer the fresh ones!  The portion was quite small... I am still hungry after finishing the noodles...  I guess since California Thai is more geared towards Asian fusion, not the real authentic Thai/Vietnamese cuisine so the kitchen is taking really easy on the spices..  The services was great! My waiter was really attentive.  They do provide free Wi Fi services, just need to ask them for the password.  Accepts all forms of payment.  PS There is also a takeout area beside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Usually these food-court establishments are more of the same, anywhere you go. This one is quite different. They have a huge selection and the stuff is really quite tasty, and reasonably priced. The spicy fish is ... well I'm pretty sure they coat the fish with crackrock BECAUSE IT'S THAT FRIGGIN GOOD.   Also the veggies were a tad too oily, but I mean, they are vegetables and you have to dress them up some how."}
{"text":"The 10 Dundas West mess hall is baffling at the best of times.  I decided to change up my game and visit California Thai, the food court counterpart to a more expansive sit-in up in Markham.  I have not tried the restaurant proper, but this food court offering is passable. If it's quantity you seek, my pad thai was enough to feed a small militia.  I barely made a dent.  But food court fare it certainly was, lacking in both flavour and interest.  I'll probably go back to try something else, but my first impression wasn't too great.  Obligatory Title Pun: At first you don't succeed, THAI, thai again.  Menu Readability:  Better than your average food court.  The decor is what drew me in in the first place.  It's like a green Blushberry.  Need to mention:  I was excited because my pad thai came straight from the wok.  The food seems fresh, so I'll give them another shot.  What this place teaches me about myself:  Pad thai is my way of calibrating Thai restaurants.  Is this the best way?"}
{"text":"I've always loved Thai food.  There's something about it that makes it attractive to me.  Whether I'm cooking it at home, or going to a Thai restaurant, I know I'm going to be enjoying my meal.  And I wasn't disappointed when I stumbled into California Thai for a quick bite to eat in the midst of some shopping.  I was shocked at the extent of their menu.  They offered everything from noodle soup to mango salad.  They even have a kids menu for the tinier appetite.  I'm sure you'll be able to find something watering to eat.  And you won't be stunned by the prices either.  It's typical pricing for a meal at a fast food restaurant, but this is a little better quality food, which makes it better altogether.  The food is prepared fast and fresh when you order.  They don't have anything sitting around under heat lamps or in hot drawers waiting to be served.  They cook everything on the spot fresh and it is served to you piping hot, and pretty quickly too.  If you're shopping around in the Beacon Hill area and are starting to feel drained, I recommend trying California Thai.  If you like Thai food, you won't be let down by this place!"}
