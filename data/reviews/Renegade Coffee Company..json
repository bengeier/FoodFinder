{"text":"I want to love this place because it's so close to my house but there's two reasons holding me back from coming here often:  -Unfriendly employees. Every time I come here I'm greeted with \"What can I get you?\" Or \"your total is $15.\"  How about a hello and how are you? It seems simple but It makes a huge difference!   -The food is just average. None of the items I've tried have been over the top delicious and for the higher prices, I just can't justify wanting to spend my money here, unless I'm in a rush.   I know they recently went through an ownership change so hopefully the new owners will turn it around!"}
{"text":"I'd love a local coffee joint, but I have such a hard time with this place. It's been almost six years that I've been in this neighborhood, and BuzzBerry/BeanBerry/Renegade has had an identity crisis from the start: Was it a smoothie place? No...there was no real fruit to be seen, just cartons of smoothie mix and ice. Was it a coffee place? No, they don't tamp their espresso. Wait. Maybe it is a bar - there are taps now! Ok, not a bar, the kegs are gone. Oh and now they are pushing their dinner specials? I didn't think this was a sit down restaurant... There are too many ideas; none well executed. I hope that changes with the remodel and the new name. I would love to return and update my review.  Kris: thanks for the update! It is good to hear that you aren't the same owners as the past years (it's been quite a while since I've been in for all the reasons listed). At any rate, I'm very glad to hear you're doing things differently than the previous owners!"}
{"text":"Nice to see this local business is not going under and I am happy to see new management is in control. I went in the other day for some iced tea and to do some work. I got the green tea. When I sat down and took a sip, I was not pleased at all with the flavor. I took it back to the counter and asked if I could exchange it (I never ask to exchange things). The two people working there (a guy and girl) apologized and said they were happy to replace it.  They then gave suggestions of what they liked and what teas they mix and match. They allowed me to sample each tea and try their mixed ones. VERY TASTY!  Awesome customer service! Very friendly and helpful. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Just a very average breakfast as we tried this place for the first time. Best part I was told was the sausage gravy. Smoothies - they must use a mix because my ingredients separated and both smoothies (even the one with kale ) were super sweet.  Breakfast Burrito - not alot of bacon and that bacon was not crispy. Also the potatoes were overcooked and had the odd tasting skins on, so it became more of a mashed potato thing .  Side of salsa - pretty uninspiring. 2 Breakfast Burro's and two smoothies were $25. The middle size smoothie costs $7 and then they nickel and dime you on the burrito. It starts at $4.50, but it's extra ($1) for potatoes, extra to have it grilled, etc. Might go back and try a sandwich at some point."}
{"text":"I really love this spot. My wife and I are regulars. We used to go here when it was called a different name, but we stopped by recently and the product is just as excellent as before.  I am excited about the new renovations.  I can't wait to see the inside. I read one of the reviews where someone was complaining about it being too quiet? That's a little strange. I don't want a loud coffee shop anyway. That doesn't warrant a 1 Star review."}
{"text":"Was out riding the bicycle this afternoon and I needed some hydration. Stopped by Bean Berry and got myself a large iced-tea. Flavor and service was fantastic. To say otherwise would be slanderous!"}
{"text":"The rudeness of the cashier at the drive thru left such a bad taste in my mouth it is hard to tell how the food tasted. I loved this place when it was Buzzberry, since the new owners came in they pulled out the plants, ripped the sign off it looks so run down. Not hopeful for the success of this place with a start like this."}
{"text":"A cute little coffee/smoothie shop on the corner of a busy intersection. I honestly dropped in because they had a drive-thru and I really wanted an iced coffee! The lady at the drive-thru was super friendly while taking my order and even took the time to answer some questions I had about the menu. They have a wide variety of options, so it took me a minute to decide. She was patient and helpful! I ended up with a simple vanilla cold brew. I received my order promptly and the lady at the window was bubbly and kind. The iced coffee was great, with a lot of flavor. The vanilla really stood out to me, but it wasn't too strong. I'm glad I stopped by, and will be coming here after the nail salon more often!"}
{"text":"I really couldn't decide between 2 stars or 3.  Unfortunately I did not find the change I hoped from the previous owners.  The \"new\" place just seems to be the old place but cleaned up.  The prices still are high.  A ham and cheese (minimal mayo/no mustard) with lettuce and tomato on sour dough bread was over $9.  You did also get a small bag of chips and pickle spear.  The sandwiches are good but on the bland side because of the lack of additional ingredients.  Staff was very polite and friendly.  Breakfast items seems more reasonable ($5 for a breakfast burrito) so may be back to try again."}
{"text":"I went there to work one afternoon recently and the AC must have been out because it was soooooo hot in there. I didn't stay, so I have no idea if the refreshments are good. I hope they're able to rectify the AC issues because it looks like a great place to hang out, but not if it's hot."}
{"text":"First visit since it changed ownership, and my experience in the drive thru was very pleasant. I ordered a chorizo burrito, the man behind the counter was friendly got me through in under 5 minutes (had to wait for my burrito to be made). The burrito itself was good, however a little salty for my preference. Their home made salsa complimented it very well, but I might try a different meat next time. Honestly for the price I paid I was expecting more, but if I wanted a big burrito I could've gone to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Wow really missing buzzberry! I came in after yoga the other week to grab a quick bite and coffee. I walked in and it was DEAD SILENT. Please take a minute to think about that, when is the last time you walked into a completely silent coffee shop? I could hear one of the patrons of the restaurant sip on his coffee from across the room.  There were two other people there waiting for food. It seemed a little eerie and run down, with nothing inside, an empty deli cooler, and bare walls. I'm hoping all the renovations going on right now are to fix that and to put in some background music... I walked up to the girl at the counter with no line, she did not smile, did not greet me, and then here's the kicker, proceeded to walk away. Weird, so I thought maybe she was really busy and caught up with making an order or maybe she had to man the drive thru?   I proceeded to stand there for about another honest to goodness 3-5 minutes while the girl was literally just standing toward the back of the kitchen. Finally a friendlier bigger guy came out from cooking in the back left corner and asked me if I had been helped and took my order. The food is about the same, but they took away the dinner menu. I'm not 100% sure how long this place will make it if they continue with the lack of customer service and general aesthetic of the coffee shop."}
{"text":"My son took his new puppy there a day ago and today took me as well. I haven't been since the new owners and renovation. Renovations are modern and look great. Great neighborhood place. New menus, highly recommend the avocado toast. Staff was friendly, the puppy was welcome on the patio they even gave him water and a bone. Highly recommend giving them a try if you haven't already. Thanks for the great breakfast."}
{"text":"You can't find a better iced espresso in the valley!  It is just so good!  The egg bowls with bacon or chorizo is a really tasty brunch item, especially when topped with avocado and their homemade salsa!  As far as sandwiches, I love the wheat bread with tuna salad.  So, so good!!!  I am excited for the remodel to be done; the place is going to look so nice!  Owners are very customer service oriented, and I love how they work the business alongside their workers!  It's a fun, hard working atmosphere!  Cool place!"}
