{"text":"OK, the atmosphere is fun and festive.  Who does not like colored lights strewn about and awesome old rock band posters on the walls?  The floors were clean and the bar area was fun... a great place to meet a friend for a canned beer.  Yes, really.  And with a gut washer choice of one chardonnay, you will drink the canned beer.  Or the draft beer- but beware, the Shiner Bock was flat and not very cold. Disappointed, party of one.  Ok, Ok... so, you might enjoy a fun atmosphere on a great street to meet friends for... drinks.  But not dinner.  I had the fried avocado tacos and the black eyed pea salad.  Both were bad.  The bean salad, and I love stuff like this, was swimming in salt and vinegar.  I think those were the only ingredients.  It was bad.  The fried avocado tacos (as a vegetarian this prospect sounded delicious to me!) were, ummm, tasteless. Which might be better than the black bean salad which might have benefited from being tasteless?  The queso was good.  But, seriously, who can't melt some cheese?    I like food too much to return here."}
{"text":"My friend wanted to try Mavericks when it had just opened so we went- Our server Katie was really cool and we felt at home immediately.   We tried the tacos, we also ordered some of the sides to pass around the table.  The street corn was awesome.  The food was full of bold flavors all around.  We have been back a bunch of times.  The chimichuri beef has settled as my favorite on the menu.  (try it in a taco, or on the Maverick Salad) The salsa trio is from flavor country for sure!!  That alone would keep me coming back, but then there's the staff- Reem and Niki in the bar like happy customers and full glasses.  Blood Orange Margaritas?   Blackberry margaritas?  Cool drink specials.   One of my friends from California was just visiting- we had dinner at Mavericks.  I think 5 staff came over to check in for hellos.   Everyone has been really friendly and welcoming- since I'm new in Charlotte this has been just as satisfying for me as the food.  My visitor (a vegetarian) also gave it his stamp of approval- he had the fried avocado tacos with black eye peas.   The Rock and Roll aspects are cool too- murals, collage and sculptures, not to mention the soundtrack- Nirvana, Zeppelin and Tribe Called Quest....the genre is broad.  Your server might be wearing a Beatles or Bob Marley shirt.  It's casual and playful.  Now if they would only open a pop up at the Music Factory so they would have some live music to add to the mix... I'd buy tacos at the Filmore. For some of the games we have watched at Maverick's, there's been a DJ mixing on a Saturday night. It makes for a great hangout...and they really do try to keep your glasses full!  Everything they do keeps me coming back for more."}
{"text":"What a great spot for dinner! $3 margaritas, awesome service, and an authentic atmosphere. The food was exceptional and we particularly enjoyed the Mexican street corn! Yum!"}
{"text":"Overall, this place is mediocre at best.  You don't get chips unless you order them and then when you did they were greasy.  The guacomole was not chunky as advertised and was a very small serving.  We had to ask the waitress for salsa and then she brought out a very small cup of it.  The margarita was awful and they had a small selection of Mexican beers.  The menu was very limited we thought but the street tacos and drunken beans were't that bad.  The service was lacking and the atmosphere was kind of cheesy.  We will not be returning to Maverick Rock Taco."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place - close by, locally owned and tacos seemed like a win-win-win.  I liked the menu concept. Service was good. I really liked the chips and guac (though no chips unless you buy salsa or guac is bizarre). My veggie taco was good, but the others were not. The chicken taco was extremely bland. Pork wasn't much better - the pineapple salsa was good but there were way too much (bland) pork and not nearly enough of anything else.  I may go back for drinks and apps only - but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Went on a dreary Sunday afternoon with two others. The food was good. One person got a veggie burrito with avocado and portabello, another got a cheese quesadilla, and I got hot \"wings\" (since there were some drumsticks, too). No real problems except I was told the wrong number of wings (it's 12 oz, not 12 wings)."}
{"text":"I went to Maverick Rock Taco the other night but they only had the bar open.  From what I could tell they were working on getting the kitchen ready for daily lunches and dinners.  I know they had some food service days prior for their \"family and friends\" so I liked the idea that they had shut the kitchen (even on a busy Saturday night) to make sure the kinks were worked out.  The menu looked great so we'll be back this week to try it out.  Also, loved the rock-n-roll theme, artwork, and tunes."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious and I have recommended them to many of my friends... I've had only one issue(not their fault, through a 3rd party delivery) and they were contacting me within seconds to resolve the issue... All was made good and I am one happy customer! Seriously impressed with the customer service and the food!"}
{"text":"Great tacos...5 stars...had the shrimp tacos and my wife had the mahi...both were fab and so were the fries and chips/salsa.  Atmosphere seems like it would be fun in the evening too. So, why the mediocre review...the service (ZERO stars) and the watery margarita...which was properly removed from my bill so kudos there. Anyway, the young lady bar-tending this past Sunday had about the worst attitude I've experienced in awhile.  Even though we said thank you to everything she threw in front of us, I didn't hear one \"your welcome.\"  She also copped and attitude when I didn't know the menu inside and out and asked a few questions.  Seriously?  It was Sunday afternoon and about 5 people were in the joint so its not like she was busy.  Just a terribly grouchy person that needs some customer service classes.  Oh but wait, she was sooo nice when handing me my credit card back for me to fill in her tip amount. I'll go back but will definitely not sit at the bar if she's around."}
{"text":"Best Mexican in Charlotte. Great service. Great food. Buffalo shrimp tacos are heavenly and I can't go without getting one! HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"I would love to be able to tell you all about the food, but I can't because after walking in on a very non-busy Sunday evening during a football game and sitting for over 10 minutes, no one even came by to take our order or even give us a glass of water. I am so disappointed that such a cute place from the outside would be such a disaster on the inside. Let me also add that the atmosphere was horrible - I've got a mouth of a sailor, but the people sitting at the bar were dropping more f-bombs than I could ever try to get out during the Panters losing season. Don't think we'll be headed back to even give it a second try."}
{"text":"This place is delish!! Cute outdoor patio, fun atmosphere and quite possibly the most unique tacos I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Chips stale... Bad start.  Green rice and beans with the combo plates flavorless and bland. Pulled pork tacos terrible tasting.  Will never return to this overpriced, under flavored, faux Tex-mex restaurant."}
{"text":"3 trips - all for lunch.  Ordered different things every time.  Here's the rundown....  Atmosphere gets 4 stars.  Funky place.  Charlotte needs more character, so this pleases me.  Their parking lot isn't as large as it probably needs to be.  Montford appears to be the new happening street in CLT, so street parking doesn't exist.  Service receives 5 stars.  Knowledgeable,warm, chatty but not too chatty, mixed in some wit into the conversations, fast, accurate, etc.  Food quality/taste/presentation receives 3 stars.  Love the concept. Love Mexican fare.  The tableside guac was killer.  The street corn was killer.  Everything else was just OK.  I went back twice after my first visit wanting it to be better and the food was about the same as the first time around - just ok.  I've had their pork tacos, their short rib torta, and their chicken torta.  The tortas are HUGE, but fairly bland.  Something with the jicama/cilantro/greens mix doesn't work well with the short rib torta.  Same with the chicken torta:  marinated peppers, pickled onions, jicama and cilantro.  Maybe it was the pickled onions?  Maybe I could have tried it with regular onions?  I don't know, but the taste combo just isn't/wasn't working for me.  The tacos were decent, but nothing to go bragging to friends about.  I wish I could bottle the Mexican food truck experience in LA and bring it to Charlotte.  Simple dishes with a ton of flavor.  Overall, I'd score it a 3.5 stars.  The next visit will certainly push me one way or another.  I wish them well."}
{"text":"Where do I start... After we were seated, it was a toss up who would be our server... They were not that busy. It took almost 10 mins to get our drinks. I was excited to try their Bloody Mary after the description I was given. Should've had a beer. It tasted like ZingZang & thats all. Average at best. After 2 different servers - we got to order. The apps were good - queso & flautas. I then got the buffalo shrimp taco & Chicken pancake combo. Chicken was great! Fried chicken with corn flakes...yum. The street corn was good as well. The shrimp was undercooked. The pancake was poorly executed.... Like the idea though.... I think actual street vendors would've been better today. Maverick fell short of my expectations...."}
{"text":"It really was a pretty nice place, and I would give it an extra half star if that were available. I think the beer is a little pricey, as are single tacos, but they had a pretty good selection of tap beers. Food seems okay, some of it quite tasty, but nothing special that I would rave about. When we were there (Sunday early evening) they weren't crowded at all; service was great."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the bomb a** drinks. Shout out to the Red Sangria!! But the food is less than subpar. Sorry, I was hoping for so much better, the presentation isn't to shabby though. Ehhh."}
{"text":"I used to love this place now I hate it. I went to dinner tonight (Tuesday) and the place was basically empty so should be fast. It was one of the worst service experiences I have ever had. I ordered a seasonal draft and was brought a two dollar light draft and our server was more than inattentive. So don't waste your time...."}
{"text":"I came in here with 3 girlfriends to have dinner and drinks to catch up. After ordering several dinners, drinks, and appetizers our service drastically changed. We attempted to order several different bottles of wine, but because they were I'm between menus, they were out of everything we asked for. We then asked to buy a bottle of their fall wine from the manager, Alex. He completely ignored out request and didn't even bother to come back to our table for 30 minutes. He didn't apologize, just told us to Come back tomorrow night.  We have all been here at least 5 times and none of us will be making it back after tonight. The one positive was our waiter, G. He attempted to be helpful anywhere he could."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places.  I have enjoyed every meal and they purchase many ingredients from local vendors.  Great food, great vibe and very affordable."}
{"text":"Their fish tacos are to die for.... so good. Wednesdays has $3 margs and $2 chicken tacos (i believe) which is such a great deal. Not authentic mexican per say, but good in it's own right."}
{"text":"There are a lot of Taco places starting to bud in Charlotte, but so far Maverick sets the bar high. What most people may not know is that everything is locally sourced. This is how local business is done; sustainability. Coming from an old school farming family (my great grandparents were farmers), I sincerely appreciate this. Salsa's and sauces are made in house (absolutely try the verde' salsa; it's amazing), and their corn tortilla's are locally sourced as well.  As far as the food; I had a plate, which comes with two taco's and one side. You can mix n' match or for $0.25 less you can have two of the same. I went with one Barbacoa Short Rip taco, and one Mojo Pork Carnitas taco. For my side I opted for the rice and beans; but only because they were out of this \"amazing corn\" that I keep hearing about. To their credit, we came at a somewhat odd hour for lunch (2:30 roughly), but you should always have your \"signature\" items stocked. This didn't impact the score overall (in my opinion) because the other food items were so strong and overall it was an outstanding experience. I also had two margarita's; the house and the blood orange and I was able to try their Spicy Cilantro Lime Fries (which comes with the same sauce drizzled over the Street Mexican Corn).  All of the food was fantastic! I was worried that the Barbacoa and Carnita's would be too similar in nature, but the way that they are prepared...make no mistake, they are far from the same. Those Mojo taco's were surprisingly good (they were a good mix of sweet and smoky with a tiny bit of kick), and the Barbacoa taco's were very close to what I was expecting (smoky and tangy with a very light hint of pickled favor from the onions). Absolutely perfect. The Rice and Beans were also good; you can tell that they take their time with the rice; I'd almost say that it's similar to a cilantro, zesty type of dirty rice. It was surprisingly good.  The staff was friendly; as in, I felt like I was being served by friends rather than a wait staff. I typically trust a servers opinion, because they have the food regularly. Unless their tastes are completely different than mine, I'm going to go with their recommendations. My servers recommendations couldn't have hit the mark any better.  The atmosphere is nice overall. The outdoor patio is great, but they may want to consider options for covering it from the heat (during the summer) and the elements on rainy days. Make use of that wonderful new patio...don't just think about that night crowd. I'm taking to you Maverick owners...  This is a great place, and I would highly recommend to anyone. There are other competitors popping up all over Charlotte (and NO, I'm not thinking about Cabo Fish Taco, which is a slightly different market in my opinion), but the prices are more reasonable, and I feel like you're getting more for your money at Maverick! I would recommend this first to anyone wanting a good, laid back atmosphere with quality ingredients at a good price. What more would you want? Enough said. 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Not great. There are much nicer Mexican restaurants near by with much more efficient staff."}
{"text":"It's me and my girlfriend's new favorite spot. She's from Texas and loved the Mexican cuisine while I love beer and those buffalo shrimp street tacos rule me.   The only reasons I mark it 4 outta five is: -i will never like TVs in a bar. I understand there purpose but I don't care for sports and they are incredibly distracting.   -The street corn should, in my humble opinion, be grilled. It was way too watery when I bit into it."}
{"text":"cool bar area for casual dining, margaritas and chips and salsa.  Pretty casual fun place with a lively buzz. Any time there are colored Christmas lights on the ceiling it's time for a laid back party.  All of the tacos are unique and some are fantastic.  The back seating area is just OK in my opinion but the bar area is more cozy and fun. They often have a band after 9:30 and it can get loud in the bar area but that can be fun too. Just depends on the band.   Good spot."}
{"text":"If I could give this another half star, I would, but unfortunately some of the service issues made this only warrant three stars. A girlfriend who was in town visiting and I decided to go here because it was within walking distance and we were in the mood for some margaritas. Got seated right away, and the waiter got us waters and (eventually) took our drink order. The first margarita came out (hers), but we waited another fifteen minutes for the second (mine). I had the beer-Rita which was terrible, tasted like ice with beer and absolutely no other ingredients (tequila anyone?)  We ordered the special of the coconut shrimp tacos, which were fantastic. I'm sad it was only a special because I would come back just for those. The mexican street corn was great too. The food comes out fast which was a plus (and surprising!) due to the waiters slowness. After we ate and drank our margs, we were going to order another round of drinks but it took our waiter about twenty minutes to come back to our table, so by then we decided to try another place on Montford. Good food, crappy wait staff!"}
{"text":"I was surprised by how good this place was.   I definitely recommend this place and if you go get the buffalo shrimp taco, the spicy salsa, and the corn on the cob."}
{"text":"Great variety of very fun tacos (broader selection than Paco's, and at least as tasty).  Street corn was great.  Mahi mahi was plainer tasting than I expected, though everything else on the plate picked up the slack for it.    Went early on a Monday so not fair to judge its atmosphere.  Server was very upbeat and friendly ... was heading for a very strong tip until she inexplicably disappeared for a verrrry long time when we had obviously finished up.  Bizarre.    We will give it another try, to be sure.  Very yummy!  Holds up its end of the family name very well."}
{"text":"When Stratos Lambos' restaurant group, Xenia Hospitality, decided to open up a taco joint on Montford...I was nervous.  Already a big fan of Illios Noches, and Big View Diner (but not so much Nolen Kitchen...but that's another story) which have Greek/Mediterranean menu items, I wasn't sure if a complete 180 into Mex could be executed well. However, the attention to quality ingredients and execution really shine through at MRT, and after 2 visits, I've added it to my list of favorites in Charlotte.   The decor is total rock n' roll, and fits the Montford crowd well.  Graffiti-style painted walls with rockstars like Gene Simmons, even Bob Marley, among others make for a dark, music club vibe in one section.  The other part of the restaurant, brighter, windows facing the street, a more rustic industrial feel.  I love how laid back it is.   The menu is nicely laid out-- appetizers of salsas (unlimited refills BTW), fundido, Mexican soup. I know the Charlotte Observer recently reviewed the restaurant and said the chips were inconsistent and greasy...but ours were nice and crispy.  Our server, Sterling said they've since improved the methods of their chips, no longer leaving them out, but freshly frying new batches throughout the day. It's nice to know they listen.    Tortas, Mexican sandwiches are very flavorful and nicely balance of meat (or veggie) and depending on the sandwich, accompanied by a tart pickled veggie, or smooth creamy cheese or avocado.  I particularly like the special torta bread (one of the many locally sourced items) which is light and airy, but crisp and grilled/toasted on the outside. We had the braised short rib, which I could not stop eating.   The main part of the menu is sectioned off by protein.  (Beef, chicken, shrimp, tuna...and veggie.)  You can then get each as a taco, burrito or salad.  I've had every single taco variety, which come on either corn or flour soft tortilla, or on bib lettuce.  (TIP: the lettuce wrap is a single piece of lettuce, which is difficult to contain all the overflowing yummies inside, but is a nice low-carb option nonetheless.) If you're getting an app, and a side (I HIGHLY suggest the street corn), you can probably get away with just two tacos, they're that filling.  (BTW: To the person who said the salsa is $7...ours was $3, and the tacos were only $3 apiece! Our bill for 2 people, app, main and dessert and drinks...$33!)  There is live music on the weekends, and drink specials...but to be honest, I'm more interested in the dessert.  The molten chipotle chocolate with chai ice cream and cinnamon sugar churros.  Yes.  You heard correctly.  This is the kind of dessert you eat once, and immediately start planning when you'll be able to get back to the restaurant for another one.  It's a sensory overload. This is not your average molten cake.  (I actually hate how it's on EVERY menu under the sun, and so often executed poorly.) This has an undertone of heat...and the molten portion is dark and gooey, and perfect for dipping the hot crispy churros.  The cool refreshing ice cream pairs so well...my only complaint is there isn't more ice cream served with the dish!   I'm excited to try their lunch menu and the burritos real soon!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware!  My boyfriend and I have been several times and are normally very happy with most.  I just left after one of the most unpleasant dining experiences I have ever had.  There aren't many veggie options on the menu, which is normally ok, since the avocado tacos I usually order are awesome.  Tonight, however, we decided to try something different, the cheese enchiladas.  The description labeled them vegetarian, and said they were served with rice, beans, and street corn.  We got the enchiladas and dug in.  When we took a close look at the rice and beans served under our enchiladas, we were surprised to discover a few pieces of chorizo mixed in.  We called over our server, who told us that the enchiladas were vegetarian, but the rice and beans weren't.  WHAT?!  You just can't label something vegetarian and serve it atop something meat-y.  So the server brought us a new dish and sent the manager over.  When we were talking to the manager, he said 'yea, we know, we have a new menu coming out soon'.  No offer to comp the meal, just acknowledging that they knew this was a problem and let it stay on the menu.  Needless to say, we won't be returning!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times and just now getting to the review. Each time we have been here it has been great.  Pro: so far everything we have tried has been great."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations for this place based on other reviews, but I loved it! I got the citrus chili shrimp tacos with a mango jicama slaw and the street corn and it all was really delicious!  We also got the ahi tuna taquitos as an app and they were great - I don't remember any seaweed in it though.  Everyone ordered different types of tacos and devoured them.  My patron cosmo drink was perfectly made - not too sweet or strong and the service couldn't have been better.  Oh and the atmosphere is both warm and fun.  The place was packed."}
{"text":"Quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Charlotte. Obviously, I'm not impressed by expensive menu type places. Give me substance. That's what Maverick does. I really only ever get street tacos because they have more than a dozen types to choose from from your normal chicken to the exotic.  If you don't get the street corn as a side, you're doing yourself a disservice. I actually called and got two orders of street corn for take out by itself one night.  Disclaimer: don't get it if you're on a first date. You WILL get the sauce all over your face.    Great little bar area which has roll up doors for spring/fall fresh air.  Plenty of TVs for games. Nice little outdoor patio too."}
{"text":"I went here with a group last night for drinks/dinner.   The service was painfully slow, even though the restaurant wasn't very crowded.  Hopefully this will improve with time.  I got one of the salsas, which was fine, but all were overpriced.    Everyone that ordered meals thought they were \"okay\" but not great, and that all were overpriced for what they got.  May try it again in a couple of months, but not in the near future."}
{"text":"This place puts the ROCK in rock taco!   I went for lunch this past Tuesday and enjoyed one of their signature beer-ritas with a girl friend who, to her delight, was able to have her favorite beer on draft. We shared an amazing pineapple guacamole dip and I devoured a delicious and fresh shrimp taco (hand-delivered by a chef, too- nice touch!)  We truly enjoyed looking around at all the decor, especially the beautiful and giant handmade American flag wall! Also, the painted posters in the bathroom are awesome.   The service was great, the manager was super friendly and welcoming, and my whole experience was truly wonderful. We can't wait to return for a taste of the nightlife! It's about a 30 min drive from the Huntersville area, but well worth the drive!  PS. I'm no Nancy Drew, but it seems to me that the user Jeff B. might just be the owner of nearby Brazwells. If I were you I'd skip that review ;)"}
{"text":"YUm!!  Tacos here are great.  The weekly specials are awesome and good deals!  Salsa and chips are gooood!! My fave is the mahi taco on lettuce and get some extra sauce....so amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times now. Great variety in the menu. Even my veggie and paleo friends were happy. Guacamole was made in house, not just dressed up like a prev post said. If they bought it. I want to know where for my restaurant! Anyway, atmosphere was rustic and hip. Fits any occasion.  I Like the music quiet enough to have a conversation, but loud enough not to hear nearby tables. They hit it right.  I wasn't a fan on the ceviche. I get what they were shooting for, but missed the mark on a tomato base ceviche. Also disappointed in the rubbery calamari rings in it. We had several apps. Server had no problem replacing the ceviche with another choice. Wing sauce was creative and different - kind of a cilantro buffalo. Really tasty.  Tacos were great and large portioned, so def worth the extra $1 vs avg taco prices. Pork could use some work. It was a little dry for me. Surprisingly the veg  and the chicken were my favs.  They lost me on the beer cocktails. Again, I get the idea. But it got to complex for me to try more that 2. Not as sessionable as the base brew had intended.  Server was great, and excited about the restaurant. I hope they all reflect that. The managers were around, but just roaming. No real contact was noticed. Ive said it a million times, know your customers. Talk to them. The drive by table touches don't cut it these days!  Keep up the good work. Wishing y'all much success!"}
{"text":"Our trip to Maverick Rock Taco started as a last minute idea when our reservations for Cowfish Sushi Bar at Southpark ended up disappearing. Not wanting to wait around for 30+ minutes for an open table we scrambled to find a suitable replacement. It didn't take long for my belly to start suggesting Mexican food and I quickly remembered our friend Fervent Foodie had visited Maverick Rock Taco and LOVED IT!!!  My first impression when walking into Maverick's was that I was obviously in the wrong place for Mexican food. The walls are decorated with colorful and even somewhat tacky Americana themed designs with the central theme being Rock n' Roll. There were airbrushed images of Freddie Mercury, Ozzy, Bob Marley, KISS, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, etc... all over the walls and a massive American Flag covering an entire hallway wall.  It only took a glance at the menu to confirm we were in fact at a Mexican food joint. We kicked off the night with chips and salsa, chips and guacamole, and the chili con queso fritters. The chips were average, the salsa was bland, and the guacamole was too salty.  The fritters... well... the fritters were absolutely delicious! They might be best described as a cheesy Mexican hushpuppy. They were balls of Mexican cheese and crispy chorizo over a bed of shredded cabbage and topped with a habanero glaze.  For dinner we tried the clay pot enchilada with beef short rib, the Dos Equis braised short rib torta, a carne asada burrito, the chorizo taco, the chimichurri skirt steak taco, and the mojo carnitas taco.  All three tacos were delicious but the carnitas taco stood out thanks to its pineapple mango salsa and habanero glaze. The chorizo taco came with cotija cheese, crema fresca, and potatoes in a double layered corn tortilla. It was good but the potatoes were cold and it turned me off of the taco quickly. The chimichurri skirt steak taco came with pickled onions, avocado crema, and a tomatillo-avocado salsa. Once again the taco was decent but the steak was a little tough and without the pickled onions I may not have finished the taco.  The Dos Equis brased short rib torta was one of the best dishes we had experienced in a long time. The torta was griddle baked and filled with poblano rojas, chihuahua cheese, pickled onions, mixed greens, pico de gallo, black beans, a jalapeno cream and served with spicy cilantro fries. The fries weren't spicy at all but that didn't stop them from being freaking awesome!  The clay pot enchiladas came with braised short ribs, smoked tomato salsa, oaxaca cheese, chihuahua cheese, crema fresca and served with charro beans, poblano green rice, and mexican street corn. The corn was on the right track but was too squishy and there was nowhere near enough crema fresca for the dish. Other than that... the dish was great and I could easily eat it over and over again.  The carne asada burrito was wrapped in a flour tortilla and stuffed with a blend of Mexican cheeses, roasted corn, charro beans, poblano rice, lettuce, and a green chili ranch sauce. The burrito had too many beans, was overall bland and pretty forgettable.  Despite being owned by the same people as Ilios Noche (we hated) and Big View Diner (nothing special), we really liked Maverick Rock Taco. The food was fresh, inventive, and full of bold flavors that we can easily get behind. It may not be authentic Mexican food but it might be some of the best Tex-Mex we've had in the Queen City."}
{"text":"The clay pot burrito, the watermelon margs, yummy nachos, the near grandma homemade chicken soup, and all the cool taco fillings. Add to that a cool patio area, plenty of flat screen tvs and nice servers. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Have passed by this place in Montford so many times. So, on Saturday my husband and I decided to give it a try for lunch.  Pretty dead for a Saturday lunch, so we were seated immediately. My husband ordered the beer special for the day and I got the Jalapeno Marg. The jalapeno margarita was delish! They put lots of peppers in there so be ware of those last few sips cause they are hot!  We ordered the guacamole as an appetizer and decided to split a taco plate (we got the chorizo taco and the korean pork with sweet potato fries as the side). They bring out a plate of chips and salsa before the meal....the salsa was perfect for me and not too spicy. Loved it! As for the guac, it was good but definitely not $7 worth since the portion size was incredible small. I definitely dont mind paying a bit more for good guac since avocados are fairly expensive. However, this was such a small baby bowl for that price. If we return, we won't be ordering that again. As for the tacos, the chorizo taco was fairly bland but the korean pork was awesome! The sweet potato fries with dip (not sure what it was....ranch maybe?) were a hit as well! Overall the food was pretty good.  Just two notes I had about the place that make this review a 3 star: -Service: The place was dead, yet service was really off. The people beside us ordered after us by about 5 minutes and got their food a good bit before us (even though they got two plates of tacos and we only got one). It seemed like the servers always hit the two tables around us and never came to ours for drinks/refills. Not a huge deal but when it isn't crowded, these things are more noticable.  -Plating: So the server brought out our tacos (and an additional plate, which was nice). However, there was a quarter size piece of fat just sitting on the edge of the plate. It was extremely gross looking. There is zero way that the server or chef didnt notice this cause it was fairly large. It kind of turned me off from the food at first. Fortunately, the korean pork taco helped rectify that some!  Overall, we may return if we are in the area but I am not sure that this is the first place I will think of when I am craving some Tex-Mex type food."}
{"text":"I am so upset about the experience I had once I left this place.  My stomach was destroyed for a full day almost immediately after I finished my meal here.  I really liked the food and everything about this place.  Unfortunately, I will not be having their Mahi Mahi tacos ever again :("}
{"text":"Great Mexican food and good prices. The food was excellent and the drink specials were awesome! Highly recommend this place!  We split the fajitas and has the local beers- all was excellent. Fun friendly staff!"}
{"text":"We decided to check out rock taco for a friend's birthday.  She'd been dying to give it a try.    We started with the chips & salsa trio.  the tomatillo was my favorite.  the roja was bland & the mango one was way too sweet for chips & salsa.    I ordered two street tacos, the tinga chicken & steak chimichurri.  The steak taco was quite delicious, I'd definitely order it again.  the tinga was completely devoid of flavor, maybe for people who don't really like Mexican food?!  I'm a \"the spicier the better\" kind of person & it left a lot to be desired.    I think this place caters to the under 26 crowd, with the tool boxes of beer, loud music & even louder decor.  Not exactly my scene.    I would go back to taste other menu items but it's definitely not a place I'd frequent."}
{"text":"Great food!! Great bar!!!  Friendly wait staff and bartenders. Love the ambiance I recommend you try everything on the menu. I my favorite is the three cheese quesadilla."}
{"text":"I have ordered Maverick Rock Taco twice via Door Dash food delivery. I must say this is my new favorite place. Not only do they READ the optional comments but also provide the request. I have added this place to my new place go to for food.  We have had the fajitas (steak and chicken), two taco plus side deal and the chicken burrito. Everyone has raved about it all.   This is definitely a must try place   Would give 10 stars if could."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised here when I came to lunch with my husband over the weekend. He had a chicken burrito and I had the 2 tacos with a side. The chips and salsa satisfied my dipping needs, the tacos and burrito were well seasoned, and the wait staff was informative for my 20 questions game I like to play and they played along well. If someone was in the mood for a little Mexican, this is a stop we would recommend."}
{"text":"Only gave 3 stars because of the past service and food quality. Last couple of times I've been here it's been weak drinks and slow service. And food only... Meh. It used to be good drinks, great service, & food you tell your friends about. If not for my past experiences it'd have been 2 of even 1 star."}
{"text":"Great place to watch games inside or outside. Tacos are ok. Chips and salsa ok. Service was great. Hard to find a Mexican place with food that can beat cantina 1511"}
{"text":"Mexican street corn-Is a must have. Great beer selections. It's worth repeating, Mexican street corn-is a must have.  Second trip....sorry Stephen didn't make Thursday, again most have Mexican Street Corn. Tacos Rock too...."}
{"text":"Love this place for the guac and tacos!  I have tried a bunch but my faves are short ribs, chicken mole and the green rice is amazing!  The guac is smooth and creamy and the margaritas are awesome. I tried the asian pear and the beer-rita."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm!  Love the chips here!  Also, had my first Moscow (Texas) Mule here and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Went the other day and ordered off the new summer menu. Got a chicken jerk taco and a bbq taco with coca cola sauce. It was great!! But my favorite thing on this menu is the cilantro lime fries! They are a must order. Love this place"}
{"text":"We visited Maverick Rock Taco this past Saturday night for the time, and it was a fantastic experience!  We were offered a seat in either the bar area in the front or the dining area in the back.  Although it would be nice if the two were adjoining vs. being separated by the kitchen, bathrooms, etc., it does give dining room patrons the opportunity to enjoy their dinners without interference of sports on the TVs in the bar area.  Noticing it was a bit loud in the bar area, we opted for the dining room.    Coronas and Corona Lights were on sale for $2, so we each got one of those.  They surprisingly came out in cans!  I've honestly never seen Corona in a can!  No worries.  For $2, I'm not going to be picky, and I still got a lime with it. :)    The menu isn't huge, but they have some pretty awesome selections, both for appetizers and taco choices.   I'd put them on par with Cabo Fish Taco in NODA.  You could either go with a few apps to share or get \"street\" tacos.  I couldn't decide which two street tacos to get, so I opted for some that I usually can't find at other restaurants:  calamari and chorizo.  There are many more that I'd love to try, though.    So for about $10, I get two street tacos, a side, and free chips and salsa.  And, let me tell you, the salsa is one of THE BEST I've ever tasted.  The tomatoes are chargrilled, giving it an incredible flavor.  The only comparable salsa I've had has been at the Mexican chain restaurant Chevy's.  They chargrill theirs too.  I could eat buckets of it.  Don't settle for wimpy salsa!    The calamari was a bit tough and chewy and probably could have used some spices, but it was still tasty, and there was plenty on the taco.  The chorizo was great, too.  As my side, I selected their unique Spicy Cilantro Lime Fries.  They had a different (good different) flavor, but weren't truly \"spicy,\" just flavored.  I liked them a lot, but I'd probably try one of their other unique side item choices next time.    We'll definitely be back.  The taste of the food and varied taco selections offered were a solid five stars.  The atmosphere could be better, but I'll let it go because their salsa rocks! (Possibly even maverick rocks?)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing.. we were craving tacos and wanted to try someplace different. This was spot on. The queso was spot on and I got full off of that before my food came. The tacos were flavorful and very filling."}
{"text":"A good, convenient place to go! When the weather is nice, the porch is a great place to enjoy Montford and a cold beverage!"}
{"text":"Decent place on Montford for when grabbing drinks.  The food by itself I wouldn't rate it as well compared some other taco places across Charlotte. They also have decent selection for beers"}
{"text":"Any place that has excellent sangria and is sweet to my kid in her high chair is a success in my book!  I've been here twice--once for late night drinks with some girlfriends and another time for dinner with my husband and 16 month old.  It's rare a place can be a good fit for both but I had a great time both nights!  The food was delicious: You've got to have the street tacos for sure.  My favorite was the chili lime shrimp taco which has jicama mango slaw, yumm!  I also liked the jalapeno mahi and the pork.  The guacamole is mediocre and kind of small (well...compared to guacs the size of your head at other restaurants) so I don't recommend that as your app--luckily you have several app choices and the good ole' staple salsa hit the spot.  All the servers were extremely nice and helpful.  I'll keep recommending this one!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad my girlfriend and I went here. The food was fresh and the service was fantastic. The chips and salsa are the best I have ever had. You can tell they use fresh ingredients. I ordered the burritos, so good!"}
{"text":"I thought the menu here gave you a pretty good selection. My wife and I both got the tacos. 2 tacos + 1 side for $9.50 ... that's a pretty good deal to me. I love that they let you pick between flour, corn or lettuce wraps as a \"shell\".   I got the Jamaican chicken & the mojo pork carnitas ... both of which I'd highly recommend. The tacos both had great flavors to them thanks to the eccentric toppings, although I think the Jamaican chicken might have been a tad better thanks to the Caribbean salsa and plantains it was packing. The spicy cilantro lime fries were awesome as well. I would also definitely recommend the mexican grilled veggies if you're looking for a \"healthy alternative\" side. It was mostly zucchini and yellow squash, but it was sauteed perfectly and had a great flavor.   We'll definitely be back to this place! We had pretty good service here given that we came around 9pm on a packed Friday night. Food was out very quickly, although they did mix up one of my tacos with one of my wifes."}
{"text":"I came here because the first two places we went were completely packed even at 9pm on a Thursday due to March Madness. I was here once over two years ago before I had even moved to Charlotte and my experience was mediocre so I wasn't expecting much. I was also a bit concerned by how empty it was compared to everywhere else on Montford.   I got the adobo spiced chicken tinga and the  pork belly tacos. Both were absolutely delicious! The chips and salsa were pretty good though it would've been nice to have warm chips. Service was good and friendly. Margaritas were a little bit too sour and gave us all stomachaches. My only big disappointment was the frozen drink machine was broken and reportedly has been for over a month. I wish they would get it fixed!"}
{"text":"I have visited Maverick Rock Taco for brunch, lunch, and dinner. I will start off by saying their food is awesome.  Very inventive tacos, good guac, and great margaritas.  So it's ashame when food is this good, that the service is so inconsistent.   When this place isn't busy, the service is fine.  Saturday night for dinner was not good however. They were about 75% full and had a few larger parties in the room we were sitting in... we were seated and waited at least 10 minutes before we were even acknowledged.  A waitress took our drink order (turns out she wasn't even our waitress) and then it was at least another 10 minutes before our actual waitress visited.  She brought us waters and took our dinner order.  A very unpleasant individual then brought us chips and salsa and didn't even acknowledge us when we thanked him. Our food came out in a timely manner so the kitchen was obviously well staffed and running well.  But still no margaritas... they arrived about 10 minutes into us eating our dinner... the waitress told us the bar was backed up... probably something to mention when taking drink orders, not delivering them 20-25 minutes after they were ordered.  We overheard other tables asking where their drinks were and one table asked how much longer it would be before they could get their check.  So it wasn't just us...  I'm sure we'll go back since we like the food... but lunch time is probably better since they're not busy and can handle the lower volume of diners."}
{"text":"Ordered the Acapulco Cobb salad for takeout.  Half of the ingredients we're missing... No black beans, no avocado, no hominy.  Basically just lettuce and chicken with a couple chopped tomatoes.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"We went to the \"friends and family\" opening of Maverick Rock Taco tonight and I must say, I can't wait to go back to try the regular menu.  Tonight, they had an assortment of chips and salsas and guacamole. In addition, they had shrimp skewers, chicken wings, sliders, and sausages.  I am not a huge fan of chicken wings, but theirs were really good.  I also loved the pineapple-mango salsa. Delish!  To go along with the light bites, they were serving up various Mexican beers and yummy white sangria. They also had a DJ spinning actual vinyl... too cool!"}
{"text":"So i get the whole Street Taco concept and I am a fan but this is not the place to experience it . The food was just okay but I ordered The Southern Peach and let's just say Great... however the service was not so great so that might hinder me returning."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa are awesome, but it ALL went down hill after that. It's easier to list what was wrong then right. As I sit here still waiting for my check, here is a list of my experiences at this place. I orders shrimp tacos, when they arrived there where only 2 small shrimps on each taco. I asked for sour cream on them and there was nothing more then a dot of it on each taco. No lettuce or cheese. We were never given any silverware or extra napkins  When asked. Fries were raw, yes raw with seasoning on them, gross!  Wait staff where miserable like they didn't even want to be here. Other patrons were complaining as well about the attitudes."}
{"text":"Heard about MRT opening on Montford and was stoked to finally have an opportunity to check it out. Made it in on a weeknight for an early dinner.   Dropped off my wife to meet with a friend, so I was flying solo. Sat at the bar and enjoyed the rather large TV screens. The bar is a nice set up with comfy seats. There is also a long table directly behind the bar which is great if you want bar access, but don't want to be nose to nose with the beer taps.   Started with a nice Dogfish Head 60 minute and the pineapple guac. All I can say is WOW. The chips are warm and thick cut. The guac is mostly smooth with a few small avocado chunks. The pineapple, which I wasn't sure was fresh or from a can, made guac a whole new revelation. Really underestimated the combo. They also had a habañero version, but I wasn't willing to venture down the capsaicin highway. Definitely would order this again.   I went with the Ahi Tuna burrito sans cusabi (cucmber and wasabi) as I'm allergic. I was a little stunned with the blandness. The rice tasted like instant rice, thrown in to a lime juice/cilantro mix. Really unfortunate addition to the burrito. I'd go without next time. The Ahi was a little overpowered with blackening spice. It was a perfect rare, just a little too overwrought with spice. I'd probably go for tacos next time 'round.   All in all, I really like what these guys and gals are doing. Love that guac and looking forward to checking out more the menu! Cheers1"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday party. Immediately ordered a margarita. Was not impressed. Very watered down, could not taste the tequila and the mix they use was way too sweet. Not worth 9 dollars so I switched to beer. For dinner I got the taco plate and chose the BBQ pork and the falafel taco. Very good. Would order again. I wish the pork had a little more vinegar taste but was still good. Service was okay but slow. Took 10 minutes to get another canned beer but the waiter was nice. It was a better experience overall then the food and drinks."}
{"text":"Very disappointed for a Restaurant from the Stratos group. They need to stick with their Greek inspired roots. Absolutely flavorless enchildas and my wife had the most disappointing chicken Fajitas ever. Unlike EVERY other Mex and Tex Mex spot, no complimentary chips and salsa. That feature will cost you $4 bucks. My waiter was nice enough to \"comp\" an order of their chips and trio of salsa's on the hoouse since it was our first visit but outside of the Mango, the Roja and Tomatillo were average at best. Expensive for what you get, I would recommend nearby Paco's Taco's and Tequila in a heartbeat and they bring free and awesome chips and salsa and definitely better food for the $$$."}
{"text":"I've now been to Maverick's 4 times, 2 for lunch and 2 for dinner. Sadly, I think I am cured. The first 3 times we went, the food was fresh and a nice new addition to the Mexican-style food scene in Charlotte. We ate tacos several times and my husband was nearly in love with the short rib sandwich. I loved the ahi tuna taco and the calamari taco. However, our last experience (which I am basing this rating on) was pretty bad. We ordered margaritas and my husband's was so salty it was not drinkable. I asked for it to be remade, and I am certain it was returned the same in a different glass with no salt. I suggested as much and the server definitely did not deny it. And as far as the server, he didn't apologize even one time for it. He actually made us feel like a huge pain for asking. When we asked to have it truly remade, he brought another margarita, but it did not taste great. Yes, it was no longer salty, but I had the same one (with no salt at any point) and it tasted way better. I suspect it was remade with less quality ingredients. And...speaking of ingredient quality, that has taken a nose dive too. On our first trips to Maverick's we were treated to ingredients that tasted fresh and were well prepared. The corn this time around tasted as if it had been boiled the night before and reheated. The tacos had declined in taste and quality-crispy calamari was limp and lackluster. We made the choice to come here over several restaurants we were considering. Given the emptiness of Maverick's on a Friday night, others chose differently, and I doubt Maverick's will make it in the competitive Charlotte restaurant scene. This last trip to Maverick's was way to pricey for bad service and mediocre food. Will not return."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for lunch.  They have a decent lunch menu and we were in and out quickly.  Chips and salsa were good and my shrimp tacos were excellent.  This place is also good at night where they occasionally have live music in the bar."}
{"text":"I love Maverick!  They have a great drink selection, lots of menu options and a great patio when the weather is nice!  It's always nice to get free chips and salsa when you drink/dine out.  I personally love the queso blanco dip (especially with chorizo) and the guacamole.  I usually get a taco plate and mix and match my options - some of my favs are the jalapeno mahi mahi, the chimichurri skirt steak and the crispy white fish tacos.  The spicy cilantro lime fries are also amazing.  My favorite cocktails have been the jalapeno rita, the cucumber jalapeno cocktail and the blood orange cocktail.  So good.  The service can be touch and go, but I have found the food and atmosphere to be worth it.  Especially if it's a night with specials: good deals!"}
{"text":"Eh, it was ok...Its just more flavorful tacos you can get around Charlotte. Didn't hate it, just didn't love it."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. In particular, the chickpea falafel taco is one of the best tacos that I've ever had. Sadly, the service leaves MUCH to be desired."}
{"text":"This place seems to be going down the tubes.  Food is still pretty solid (except for chips which seemed stale last night) but I suspect there is a management problem.  Bar area seemed dirty, bartender far from being friendly, vinyl on bench all torn up, old limes served in beers, sticky tables, etc.  Sad, used to be one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Visited late afternoon on Friday and was greeted promptly by the bartender.   I ordered the Baquero Cowboy platter.  The rice and beans side was excellent as were the three tacos (I liked the carnitas taco the best and the skirt steak taco the least).  My wife ordered the Korean taco (yummy) and the Roasted Beets taco (just ok).  We had great service, loved the music,  the food was presented well and was plentiful; however,  we both thought the food could be amped up a notch in flavor.   Maybe I was expecting more heat.   We also thought the $8 for house chardonnay was a little steep since the pours were small.  Overall,  a solid 4 stars drifting towards a 5.  FYI:  Maverick Rock Taco is part of the Xenia Hospitality Group with other Charlotte restaurants, such as Nolen Kitchen, Big View, and Ilios Noche."}
{"text":"How in the h-e-double hockey sticks does this place have only three stars?  I can only guess its because regulars want to keep the place up themselves.  After the delicious lunch and the warm friendly service I just had, I will do my part to bring the avg rating up. The street corn - unique and delicious. The tacos - the best IMO vs. its direct competition in Charlotte. Atmosphere - much more roomy and comfortable than I expected. Service - friendly, warm and timely.  I will definitely - definitely - be back for more."}
{"text":"Great staff, new menu items delicious. Love the margaritas, all made with fresh lime juice. House margarita is outstanding.  Outdoors seating limited yet fun with the colorful chairs, umbrellas etc..."}
{"text":"One thing will definitely steal the show of my review: when we were at Maverick, the guy sitting at the table next to us tried the 5 lb. burrito challenge. We basically couldn't focus on anything else. It was HUGE and just thinking back on it makes me a little queasy. Props to that man, though. He won and got a t-shirt (you only get a t-shirt and a little name recognition? Ouch).   Anyway, the food was perfectly fine. We enjoyed watching football on the multiple tvs and the atmosphere was spot on. Maybe it was the shoes I was wearing, but damn. Those floors are slippery. Be careful on your way to the bathroom, especially if you've had a margarita or two."}
{"text":"We ate dinner here tonight. It's probably the 4th or 5th time I've been. It was very poor service. There was no server to be found for about 5 minutes after being seated. My drink order was wrong. We waited for our server for a while to order and then when we ordered our food arrived within 5 minutes. I ordered a salad I've had before and it was totally different this time and missing 4 ingredients. There are too many good restaurant options with similar cuisine to come back here."}
{"text":"Love Maverick Rock Taco! This place is a hip trendy atmosphere with a rock n' roll twist. Say hello to street tacos done an American way. The parking is a little cramped for my style, but once you enter this restaurant you will forget all about the parking. My favorite tacos are the Carribean Chicken tacos. Definitely try the green rice & mango slaw. Two of my favorite side dishes. Top your food off with an ice cold beer or a margarita. My boyfriend & I at least come here once a week. We love the food because we never feel that Mexican baby belly once we live! Great place for kids, parties, or to just socialize with friends. They also have t.v.s hanging up so those sports fanatics can watch the game! Afterwards go bar hop down Montford!"}
{"text":"Pork carnitas lunch special burrito  was fantastic. Cant beat it for the price! With cilantro lime fries....WINNER!"}
{"text":"I've been to Maverick Rock Taco twice in the last week now, and I feel like both times were solid 3-star experiences - some aspects of the meal were great and some were average.    My first visit was last Friday night around 7:30 pm and it was packed!  The wait was about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad compared to other spots in Charlotte on a Friday night.  I also went on a Sunday at 7 pm and there were only a few people there.  Both times the service was attentive and food came out quickly.    I read in some reviews below that chips and salsa had to be ordered, but that wasn't the case when I was there - they were brought out as soon as our table sat down, which is good because I love me some salsa.  What I really enjoyed - tomatillo salsa, guacamole, chimichurri steak taco, grilled vegetables, and the Mexican street corn.  Ugh that Mexican street corn is so good I can't explain it...I just can't.  It reminds me what I used to get from the county fair every summer when I lived in California (and believe me, this corn was so legit I still think about it 10+ years later).  Average menu items included the chili lime shrimp taco and the steak fajitas.  They were fine, but it's not like I'll be clamoring to order either of those dishes again.  I had a sip of a skinny margarita but couldn't finish it because it was too sweet for my taste, but everyone at my table absolutely loved theirs.  The location right on Montford is really convenient and it's a fun place to go with friends, so I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Update...went here again and I left disappointed. I got the chips and salsa to start. The salsa is fine, but I didn't get the impression it was made in house. I ordered the salad again, but this time I asked to have my salad fixed after it arrived at the table. Most of the bowl was just lettuce and there were just a few black beans scattered throughout. Even the server was surprised that it was mainly lettuce. When it returned, they spruced it up by piling a couple extra ingredients on top of my lettuce. It didn't taste like fresh veggies, but something you'd get from cans (e.g., canned corn, pickled cactus). Highly disappointing especially when I could do better at a salad bar.   After going twice, it's unlikely I'll be back a third time. I need flavor and quality when it comes to my food, which neither was found during my visits here."}
{"text":"I'm adding this to my list of places to eat at for lunch.  It fits in nicely with the rest of the great fare on Montford and has some really good offerings.  The food: I'm not a seafood sorta guy so I stuck with the chicken and pork tacos.  The chicken is a solid item with great tastes gong on.  The pork taco, on the other hand, knocked my socks off.  The meat itself was seasoned and cooked to perfection and worked well with both the flour and the soft corn shells.  What got me going was the pineapple mango salsa that topped this beauty, it was a beautiful complement to the meat and offered a new take on the taco.   As far as sides go, I keep going back to the mexican street corn:  think grilled corn on the cobb with some saucy goodness.  Warning: not beard friendly but definitely tongue lovin.   Appetizers - The chips and salsa  trio's blend includes some great tastes (my fave is the pineapple-mango..go figure) and the Guac trio also serves up nicely.  The wings pack tasty heat that doesn't dissapoint.  The atmosphere:  Stylish, fun.  Booths and tables were comfortable.  The long table at the bar with bar-height metal stools - not so much.  Avoid if you can.  The Value: Lunch special of 2 tacos + side is plenty of food at a good price (8 bux).  Dinner - you're ordering tacos and sides independently so you're probably paying more, but not outrageous."}
{"text":"Beans and rice could be their own food group for me I love them so. I came with a big group, but it seems like my experience echoed many of previous reviewers. The food was pretty banging. The service not so much. Sorry dude, you did you best but who assigns one waiter to a group of 15 or so when the restaurant isn't even 1/3 full? We ran the poor guy ragged. All the food I tasted was pretty dang good but without the service matching up it is a tough sell. I will return maybe on a Wed. for their 3,2,1 specials for margaritas and chicken tacos.   Highlights: the drinks claim to be made for local ingredients and herbs. Well, these may be some of the best in Charlotte. I tried the signature margarita and the Texas mule. I could come here just to sit at the bar and bunch on their well-balanced salsa.  My tacos were filling and chock full of flavor. Lots of unique combination and gluten-free/veggie options. You can get any taco as a lettuce wrap.  Lowlights: Limited parking, their neighbors tow so try for their lot or street parking and the service."}
{"text":"Love this local Mexican place! The food is always awesome and the service is excellent. The Maverick bowl and Mexican street corn at on point! Also the jalapeño cucumber monitor is amazing, so refreshing, I have tried to make this drink at home and cannot make it nearly as good as they do!"}
{"text":"First off, this place, from the outside looks like a total hole in the wall. But don't let that fool you, it totally is. The staff there though, is amazing. Short staffed and crowded they managed to fit- and serve - 25 people at the drop of a hat. We made the reservation just a couple hours before and were at the restaurant for no more than an hour and a half. Which is amazing for a party that size.  I had the steak burrito which was amazing. It gave chipotle a run for their money in my book. My girlfriend had the Grigo Beef Tacos and said they were really good as well: \"beef tacos can be really bland sometimes and it can be difficult to spruce them up. This place did a great job at doing just that.\" Another person at the table had the pancake taco which was \"different, but good\".  The atmosphere was very nice. Laid back, loud and just generally fun; following the rock history, tex-mex decor. The walls are (spray?) painted with various rock musicians from Ozzy to Bob Marley."}
{"text":"There is a bartender that is really funny with a shaved head that was so nice! The margarita's are small but delicious. The taco's are delicious too!"}
{"text":"Now I eat a lot of Mexican food, pretty much everyday I have something in tortilla form, so my standards are a little skewed. First off the decor is very nice, tex mex cantina vibe, and they also have garage doors that they can open in warmer weather which is a plus. The dining areas are divided in two, which is  kind of a  bummer but hey thats just the way the building is laid out. When I was there the service was good, nothing over the top but hey we got our food. Chips and salsa were good, but it is a bummer that after the first round you have to pay. My guessing is since Montford is a happening bar area on the weekends they don't want a bunch of drunks coming in and ordering one beer and cleaning them out on their chips and salsa, again only my guess, but they should make some clause like unlimited chips with entree purchase or something. I got the chicken burrito, which was good, nothing to write home about but good. The cilantro fries though were really good, highly recommended. They have quite a few specials thorough out the week that are a good deal as well. Overall I would come back, but I'll take my time getting there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and interesting salsa come immediately to mind remembering my first visit to this great spot!  The menu is not your run of the mill, either.  They offer some interesting items such as tortas (mexican sandwiches), street-style corn (OMG! YUM!!), and cilanto-lime fries.  Menu items are generous (read: over-sized) and they have some local craft beers on tap.    I've seen other people mention that you don't get free chips and salsa here, which is true.  But, let me tell you what you DO get.  If you order chips and salsa, your chips are bottomless.  These chips are fresh, and perfect!  If you order the trio salsa, you get the traditional tomato-based salsa, then you get a tomatillo and avacado salsa, and a sweet-heat mango and habenero. We ordered this and it was a really enjoyable appetizer.  The restaurant is laid out in two distinct areas with tables in both areas and we were told they are adding a patio in the back.  I'm told if they do have live music, the layout allows you to enjoy the music, or escape to the other area where you can still have a normal conversation with friends.  This is a huge draw for me, as I usually find live music in restaurants to inhibit conversation due to the volume level.  Overall I really enjoyed our visit here.  The one draw back was that the hostess seemed to be ready for us to leave.  It may have just been a misunderstanding on her part, but she came and took our chips and salsa (that we were still snacking on) as soon as we paid our bill.  It was just one of those moments where we were so surprised we didn't even think to stop her until she was gone, lol.  It wasn't a big enough deal to keep us away, however, and I only mention it here as a caution in case this is her habit.  Suggestion:  ask the table before taking food away.  On to the next time... I'm dying to go back just for the corn!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here three times since discovering two months ago. The two dine ins were great. My take out lacked but what can you expect having left it in the fridge over night. Loved the corn on the cob. Off the cob not so much ( but see \"fridge\") to understand why. Tacos were excellent and loved the creativity in their variety. Wait staff were knowledgable and at tentative w/o hovering. Decor was fun Tex/Mex but could use some sprucing.  Great fun and value for the money. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Decided to meet some friends here for lunch. Being the fashionably late person I am, showed up around 4:30. Which lets me check out all the cool decor, except the freaky bathrooms. Felt like I walked straight into a club decked out with neons and blacklights while peeing. Just a bit weird since it doesn't match with anything else they got going on at all.  The service is very friendly. I liked her recommendations and thought they were sensible. Had a salad for lunch. It was fruit. With wine. Okay it was a Sangria, I'm on a liquid diet okay? Why did I choose this? Because I could not in good conscience pay $3-4 for a mini taco.  Sorry Maverick I did taste my friend's orders though and was not super thrilled by the flavors. I can get a better taco from one of the Latino food trucks on the side of South Blvd. Serious."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my Mexican Street corn! Yep! My favorite! I also had the buffalo shrimp taco and tequila shrimp taco as well and they were delicious! A little spicier than I expected but still great! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"This place looks Fantastic!  This Neighborhood deserves a place this cool??? Really Cool place to watch X Games (Live on TV).  If this is a Sports Bar, this is MY kind of Sports Bar!!!  They were playing \"Strutter\" by KISS as we were leaving.  Food is three times better than \"Cabo Fish Taco\"  Service was 100% better than \"Cabo\"... We had three different Tacos, each was more disappointing than the previous!  Chimichurri Skirt Steak, Ground Beef and Fried Avocado...    Chimichurri Steak Taco gets 2.22 yelp stars  Ground Beef Taco 2 yelp stars  Fried Avocado 1 yelp star  The Mexican Street Corn was missing flavor, unenjoyable!  Best Part of the Food was the FREE Chips and Salsa!  Best NOT because they were Free, only because they tasted better than the other food! Salsa gets 3 yelp stars  Cool Decor and Salsa are Bringing the yelp stars up to barely 3 for this review!"}
{"text":"So this is the third restaurant in the Xenia Hospitality Group. The BIG VIEW DINER is always reliable. ILIOS NOCHE is always consistent and a favorite for small plates. It was time for concept number three, MAVERICK ROCK TACO. It is located in an old favorite breakfast/lunch spot that I used to eat at for decades. They did a really great job on the remodel. Three of us went for lunch and we were seated very quickly. There seemed to be only one wait staff person working. The manager took our drink order and said our waiter would be there shortly. Before leaving the table we ordered Queso Dip. The Dip arrived and our waiter noticed we did not have our Chips and Salsa. He brought that back. The chips were not crisp or warm and  tasted like they came from a bag. We had to send the Queso back, barely room temp. We placed our order and the Queso returned, hot.  One order was a BEEF TACO, nothing special, looked like Taco Bell. I had two tacos, one with SHRIMP and one with GRILLED MAHI. The Shrimp were over cooked and chewy. The MAHI was overcooked and dry. My BLACK BEANS were hot and fairly tasty. My wife ordered the CHICKEN BURRITO. Unfortunately it was warm and bland: no seasoning, not even any salt. Also disappointing was the fact that the Tortillas were Food Service purchased. If you specialize in TACOS, take the time to make your own Tortillas, it's not that hard. My wife called over the Manager and explained about her BURRITO and he said he would talk with the Chef. Being somewhat of a FOODIE and being in some sort of Food related industry most of my life, I couldn't hold back. I explained the rest of the issues and said I didn't want anything,  we just thought he needed to know. The waiter brought our check and said the Manager took the food off, only charging for the drinks. The Manager came over and I thanked him. He then gave me a card for a complimentary app and also a $10.00 gift card for one of the other concepts.  We'll probably give them one more try but it will be a while. The owners are Culinary Grads and have worked in the U.S. and abroad but it doesn't show at MAVERICK ROCK TACO...."}
{"text":"My new FAVORITE place!  I could not rave over this restaurant enough! I went in on a whim because Montford Drive is close by, and decided to try it out! The dips and chips, the street tacos, the mixed drinks- it was all incredible! They are fast, the food tastes delicious, the drink and food menu is innovative and unique, and the atmosphere is really inviting & fun!  I have come with a group of 20 and on a date, and love it all the same : )  This place ROCKS!"}
{"text":"Get the street corn, this place is the best for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place because it's close to home and I love Tex-Mex, but I just can't.   I gave it a try twice and both times my food came out cold. Besides the food being cold the flavor was good and they have a great blood orange margarita. I would come back just for drinks."}
{"text":"Great spicy salsa and really good chorizo con queso but they got my order wrong but server corrected mistake. Neither of us thought the entrees were up to snuff. If you're going Mexican go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group and loved how accommodating they were! We were split between two tables but we were able to hop around and speak to each other.   The frozen margarita was super sweet but I enjoyed the smooth texture and the flavor. The fajitas were also good but definitely not the best I've had (hence the four stars)  The restaurant is close to Park Lanes bowling lanes so we ate and then walked over.   I loved the decor and heard the tacos were amazing. The sangria was SO GOOD."}
{"text":"I decided to check out this new spot and will definitely add it to my list of favorites! I love the decor it has a very much retro rock feel. The service was great and the food was fantastic. I ordered the fried avocado taco with the infamous corn as a side and boy was I in for a treat!!! The prices are reasonable and it's a laid back type of restaurant. Check it out if you haven't!!!!"}
{"text":"I recently made a lunchtime expedition to Maverick Rock Taco with some coworkers after it was enthusiastically endorsed by another set of colleagues. Our visit got off to a bit of a rocky start in that I didn't realize that the parking on one side of the building is reserved for another business, despite the fact that the spaces are immediately adjacent to MRT. Fortunately, that was quickly resolved by moving to the other side of the lot, and in we went.  The first thing I noticed upon entering is that they had quite a large space. The lunch crowd was fairly thin when we went, but I'd expect the volume serves them well on the weekends. For our purposes, though, the emptiness and size made it hard to hear the people just across the table. Don't go wanting to have a profound conversation unless you want to shout. This isn't a dealbreaker, but it is worth noting.  On to service and food: Our waitress was... well, bless her heart. If you are from the South, you know what that means. If you aren't, I'll explain: she was as sweet as could be, but she was all over the place and wasn't at her mental peak. Sides were forgotten, drinks were misplaced, one of our party didn't get his entree with the rest of us because she forgot to bring it out. I can't be too cruel because she was indeed a sweetheart, so I'll repeat: bless her heart.  The food was tasty. The menu is fairly extensive with lots of options, but I figured for my first visit, I'd stick to the basics. Thus I ordered chicken tacos, and while I found them perfectly edible, they did lack a bit of oomph. My coworkers who ordered more exotic fare, such as fried avocados or mahi mahi, seemed more excited about their meals. As others have mentioned, the salsa is good.  I'll go back to Maverick Rock Taco for sure. Maybe they'll earn another star on a subsequent visit. For right now, the verdict is \"Three stars: solid lunch spot.\""}
{"text":"Great food, very different from normal cheap Mexican. Was place for upgraded foods, could taste everything was fresh and not out of a can. Like the different ingredients like mango used. Loved the posters in the bathroom. Reminded me of CBGB's back in NYC old school... ;)"}
{"text":"Great food and a wonderful patio. Had two pescetarian friendly dishes of mixed tacos. All very good though my high hopes for the wife's fried avocado were not answered. My shrimp taco was however excellent!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place! The vibe was cool and the bartenders were all so nice. Greeted you by name, made you feel welcome. Not anymore. I guess it is because they've had so much turnover here. Faces change regularly here! Anyways.....I'm in here right now and here has been my experience: I walked through the front door to the hostess with her head down on her cellphone. The bartender (guy) had been checking his phone regularly! Waitresses have come behind the bar to check their phones! I realize it isn't super busy but there is nothing worse than a disinterested staff! Cellphones mean disinterested! If I ever ran a restaurant, my staff would NEVER be allowed to be checking their phones in front of customers! Ever! What a terrible impression. Lastly, I have eaten here regularly. Food is pretty good! I started with some queso first! I feel like it was cheese from a can warmed up and served! Very bland and nothing special! They should take a lead from Bakersfield! They have the best queso in Charlotte! The tacos are very good and innovative/creative! I haven't been here in a while and tonites cellphone staff just make me believe I should go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I was so, so excited to give this place a try. Mexican food, guacamole, margaritas?? It's my perfect little restaurant trifecta. Sadly, my husband and I were in and out in an hour and we probably will not be back any time soon.   We were seated at a comfortable table near the bar and offered popcorn. What? Where are my chips and salsa? Oh, we have to order them? Hmmm... I was slightly suspicious. I politely declined the popcorn and perused the drink list. The list looked good! My husband and I both wanted to try something different - I got the blueberry mojito and he ordered a fresh mango margarita with salt. Forever and ever later, our drinks arrived. Mine was fine. Just fine. His drink tasted like they had mashed up some frozen mango and it had thawed in his drink. It also did not come rimmed with anything. Small detail, but still...   We ordered the guacamole trio as an appetizer. Whoa. A ton of guacamole. We probably should have asked another couple to sit with us and help us eat it. The guacamole concept, three different guacs, all a little bit different, is a great idea. Unfortunately, it tasted like pre-made guacamole that each had a little bit of something mixed in at the last minute. Totally disappointed. The chips were ok but also nothing amazing.   Our meals were fine. Nothing exciting. My husband ordered three different tacos - he said the pork one was excellent, the other two were pretty blah. I also ordered a fish taco and it was ok. Nothing stellar.   All in all, our entire experience took less than an hour. Our server was super nice, the bar was neat and clean and cool. But, unfortunately, the drinks, the apps, and the meal were all totally ho-hum. Such a bummer! I will try to get back in and give it another try but I certainly won't be rushing to do so."}
{"text":"The tacos came out cold and the fish tacos taste like mrs Paul fish sticks.   Only not as good because they were cold.  Pretty bad when I can get better tacos from the microwave frozen food section at harris teeter."}
{"text":"For the life of me I can't figure out why this place has less than 5 stars. It's probably my favorite Mexican place in town.  Although the ambiance is reminiscent of a TexMex biker bar, we brought my old-fashioned Hispanic mother here. She agreed that it's some of the best gringo Mexican food either of us has ever had. The food is hot, the ingredients are fresh, the dishes are well made, the service is great and the drinks are varied. I love that they serve skinny margaritas, red/white sangria and tons of beer choices. What more do you want in a Mexican restaurant?"}
{"text":"First, let me say that if I had the option I would give this 3.5 stars...but I don't have that option and I'm not giving it 4 stars. The tacos are good here, but I feel like they are a little expensive. 2 tacos ran me $8 and that doesn't include any sides. Granted, the tacos are good-sized, but just not worth that much. The service was good, but not great."}
{"text":"Maybe the best $20 lunch I've ever had. For $8 you can pick any two tacos with a side and a drink. My husband and I met for lunch and really enjoyed our meal! I had the Korean Pork and Jalapeno Mahi Mahi. Would definitely order both again. And while the Mexican street corn IS tasty - I don't need that kind of mess... especially since I don't typically travel with dental floss. That being said lunch was delish, and such a great value! I could have done without the blaring music though - and service was a touch slow given we were having lunch early - at 11am - and we were the only people in there! I will definitely be going again soon!"}
{"text":"We have visited twice for lunch and had a blast each time. Top notch tacos and a clean crisp fun environment."}
{"text":"So went here to eat. disgusting....They don't give u chips and salsa for one. Number two they don't have queso on menu, the thing they have that is like queso is wierd and comes with tortillas. Food was sub par, menu was confusing. Bar tender had great tits though so they get one star."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here for my first visit.  They did a good job with the up fit.  The screen windows in the front were a nice touch. Had both chicken and tuna tacos.  Chicken were very good with great flavor.  Tuna tacos were just OK..they did not have much flavor and were very, very runny- tons of water or something in the sauce added. The street corn was amazing! will go back again during a busier time..looks like it could be a fun place"}
{"text":"This is a solid go to location.  Fortunately I do business near Maverick so I get to enjoy this place often.  Never had a bad meal here.   The Pork Maverick Bowl is my favorite.  I have tried a good variety of their tacos.  Will continue to go back every time that I can."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  Had fantastic service (went during lunch and at their \"Friends and Family\" opening). I hate that folks a week ago got the service they did-but this place had literally JUST OPENED and their staff was still training. Guys, give them another chance!  The atmosphere is awesome-from the spray painted rock-icon murals in the dining room to the BEAUTIFUL distressed American flag (done by a friend of mine) to the wacky art in the bar.  And, since my favorite spice blend happens to be cilantro/lime/chipotle-their menu makes me one happy girl! Try the wings-and don't diss the special ranch-it is AMAZING! Also fantastic-their cilantro-chile fries. YUM!  And if you like tequila, they have plenty for you to sample.  I'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I am generally not a big fan of the cliche restaurant themes, so when I heard about \"Rock Taco\" I was thinking \"here we go, another cheesy spot that will play loud music and push tequila shots to make you forget about the bad food\" but I was pleasantly surprised... so much that I didn't care about the bad rock artwork or the motorcycle parts on the walls.  Let me first say that a well crafted taco is one of life's great pleasures, and it is all centered on quality ingredients.  I could tell these guys don't cut corners - the meat and veggies were all super fresh and the corn tortillas were just perfect.  Quality was so good that I didn't need those Patron shots after all.  Only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that second time I went I felt like I got the B team experience... it was a Sunday and I'll give 'em a pass because I think everyone was hung over, but consistency is needed to get a 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. There salsa is made in house and even the margaritas on special are fresh squeezed. They are reasonably priced and have come up with some awesome flavor combinations. I had there chicken tacos, pork tacos and there fried avocado taco. The first two are perfect but the fried avocado is a little bland.  Over all they have great service as well. I would definitely recommend them, especially on their Wednesday night special."}
{"text":"They charge for chips and salsa refills, and after a half hour of sitting down, we still have not ordered, ended up leaving."}
{"text":"This place used to be a favorite...even held a couple birthday dinners. Had dinner there tonight though after a hiatus and am sad to report its gone down hill.   They were out of children's menus (weird), they removed my husband's favorite Mexican pizzas from the menu, the chips were stale and the shrimp on the tacos tasted off. The corn was also way overcooked and unappetizing. They also got my order wrong and never brought out the beans I ordered my kids.   Fortunately we had a very nice waiter who was attentive and even comped meal. So disappointing though and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Mexican street corn is awesome and $2 for Tecate tall boys late night is where its at"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch here today. Fantastic blood orange margarita. I had Jamaican jerk tacos which were very tasty. My wife had the \"maverick\" lunch bowl, which she enjoyed. The only change she would have made was to have shredded beef instead of ground beef.   The waitstaff was fine. We enjoyed our lunch and the price was nice for lunch."}
{"text":"Dollar Tecates, 2 dollar tacos and 3 dollar margaritas? Consider this your new go to Wednesday spot.   Good service and quick to drink refills!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch, everything about it was on point. Had an old mech copper and two korean bbq tacos on hard corn shells. Was delicious. Good tacos cometimes give people a bit of sticker shock but they were priced in the same range as others of comperable quality. Will be returning."}
{"text":"Five stars for the food, and drinks. They have Tecate, which happens to be one of my favorite Mexican beers, and it's super cheap!  Two stars for the service. Poor guy either had to idea what he was doing, or he had too heavy of a load. Either way it took forever for us to get another beer, and of course the checks were messed up.   We will certainly return for more fish tacos!"}
{"text":"Been here twice - once for lunch and then dinner. Both times great food. Tacos offer a variety of flavors. Wait staff friendly and quick. Casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"The good: unique, lively decor The bad: so far, all of the food. Went for lunch Friday with a friend. The wings were over cooked and lacked flavor. My friend gave the soup and salad 2 thumbs down.   In addition they make flour tortillas with a hint of corn, and the server claimed this was the authentic way. Never seen this in a South American restaurant operated by South Americans.  They make their chips the same way, and thus more closely resemble pita chips than tortilla chips.  No es bueno.  Near-average for American-Mexican food but needs work."}
{"text":"I have now visited Maverick 2 times. I am glad I went the second time, because they redeemed themselves somewhat when it came to service. The first time I went we were basically ignored after being seated. When I order by tacos I specifically asked for no onions as I was allergic, she then brought me a plate that obviously had onions on it. When I asked for a new order, she looked upset. The second was much better, our waitress was friendly and very attentive.  Really the thing that saves Maverick is the tacos. So much variety, so much flavor! The skirt steak taco is great, as is the pina colada taco. The Mexican Street Corn is also very good! I have tried both the White Sangria and the Margarita. The sangria was good, but the Margarita was very salty.  Overall, I gave 4 stars because I have enjoyed the food and service was much better the second time, but they definitely have some issues."}
{"text":"One of the best taco places in Charlotte, with great food, outstanding margaritas, and a really cool atmosphere. Only downside is the parking. We usually come early (we have small kids), but plan to park someone else on Montford Dr. and walk if you're coming after 8 p.m. Another small complaint is having to pay (!) for chips and salsa, but the tab is still pretty reasonable compared to other taquerias. All in all, a great place for tacos and tequila!"}
{"text":"The food here was fabulous! I ordered a pineapple mojito, gringo beef tacos, and sweet potato waffle fries. All of it was incredible! Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because we were told it'd be a 10 minute wait, but waited for 45. I don't mind waiting at any place, but be a little more open if it's gonna take longer."}
{"text":"I am disappointed to stay that they have changed their sangria.  I had previously wrote how they had the best sangria I have ever had in my life. I had pumped all my friends and boyfriend up about getting sangria and after a month, we finally made it.   The original sangria came filled with plump black berries and was made with basil which added the perfect twist to the sweetness.   However, this has all changed. No more plump black berries. No more basil. Their excuse was that basil is out of season.  I am pretty sure that you can still get a hold of it.  I think the real reason is that the person who created the menu has since left.  My bet is that the new chef thought he could cut corners without realizing the impact it had."}
{"text":"Nice clean place. Main entree was good - fried avocado taco and pulled pork taco   However the sides were disappointing. Pablano rice had no flavor and the black eyed peas were hard and served cold. Salsa was good but would be better if served warm or at least room temp."}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday night with 2 girlfriends and loved it. Quick service, dank food and good value.  $1 Tecate -yesss I had the Tequila Shrimp Taco and Mexican Street corn as a side (was too full of beer and chips to eat the chicken tinga)...   Definitely a casual spot I would frequent to get my street taco fix. Want to try the pineapple guac next time :p"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. First visit I only had drinks.  Nothing serious.  Drinks were decent.  The most recent time I had a late lunch there and had the vegetarian taco entree.  The food was good enough. I mean I wasn't in love with it and could probably do a better job at home for cheaper, but it was decent.    No issues with the service. (The same server waited on me both times).  Why 3 stars? I expected a bit more from the food."}
{"text":"We have been here three times and have always left happy. Great place for cinco de mayo. The food is excellent everything we have had has been very good."}
{"text":"Ate there today and had one of the best chimichangas. I haven't had on in a while and it was delicious. And they just added this to the menu."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool look to it.  Mexican street food and great music.  They serve chips and salsa at the table; but charge $2 bucks after the first bucket.  Salsa was really good, but chips were room temperature and not remarkable.  Got the Mojo Pork Taco's and they were delicious.  My lovely fiancee got the Tequila shrimp tacos and that was even more delicious.  My side was the black beans, next time I want to get the Mexican street corn; heard the waitress describe to another table.  Service was good, nice joint we'll be back."}
{"text":"We liked this place... mostly because it was half priced fajitas night (Tuesdays)... I think if we had paid full price, this might not be a three star review.  The fajitas were really tasty, but not earth shattering. What WAS awesome was the roasted corn with their southwest chipotle dressing on it. I may have to eat corn on the cob that way at home! The cilantro rice was interesting and tasty too. Beans... not so much.  Someone mentioned below about the salsa and chips not being free after the first serving.. I have to agree that is a serious bad mark against the restaurant. Their salsa is one of the best I've had. I wanted more of it.. but no way was I going to pay for it. That's just crap. It costs them next to nothing for chips and salsa. Don't be so cheap with it.  My wife said the guacamole was very good.. I don't eat it so you have to take her word for it.  In summary, go there on Tuesday nights for half price fajitas. It's well worth it just for that."}
{"text":"What makes this place cooler than the other bars in town? The outdoor seating area! And I don't mean just ANY outdoor space, this is a fenced in area, with colorful christmas lights adorning the top of the patio, with brand new wooden high picnic table and benches. 3 Large flat screen TVs are on the outside patio, so you will not miss a second of the game you came here to watch. It is a magnificent experience after the sun cools off and enjoy yourself on the patio with good company. Great for conversations as it is much quieter outside. The sound of the TVs are muted so you can enjoy your company at the same time.  Try any of their chips and dip and you will not be disappointed. The avocado dip is awesome, the avocado is very fresh. The Queso dip is also banging, not too salty or hot.  I wouldn't come back here for tacos, if I wanted taco I will probably go to Cabo Fish Taco in Noda. Their Tacos were OK.   The drinks were quite fantastic, we ordered red sangrias to share. There were chunks of strawberries in the sangria. It was just the right flavor, sweet but not to sweet, you can taste the alcohol, and the drink was refreshing.   The turn-around for our orders was really fast. We also really appreciated that all of our items were served in a nice presentation, which you can not expect at most bars."}
{"text":"Live music!  The band was really good!  A good bluesy cover band.  The lead singer had a great voice & played a mean harmonica.  The servers were nice & they even put on a ball game we wanted to see.  Nice big tv's.  Queso & chips were really good & they salsa that comes with the complimentary chips is nice & smoky, not too spicy.  Just went for the music & some drinks, so didn't try anything else.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place but was a little disappointed. The service was kinda slow but the waiter was nice as could be. Tacos had a good flavor but weren't served very hot. Same for the street corn it had great flavor and a unique sauce but was kind of cold when I got it. Salsa was delicious and on the mild side."}
{"text":"My husband and I were regular's here.  The last couple of times were terrible.  The first time it was bad we chalked it up to a fluke.  After the 2nd we won't be returning.  Everything was cold.  The queso needed a spoon, cold.  I ordered the tortilla soup, COLD.  I will admit that the waitress was awesome.  She understood I was unhappy and made every attempt to fix it.  Even explained that they had a new chef.    Nope. No more!"}
{"text":"I can only base this review on service and not on food because we never got to that part. My roommate and I waited a solid 10 minutes before even seeing a menu that she had to go get from the host/register area near the door because no one brought us any. It was maybe a little busier than it could have been, but when someone walks in you make sure to bring them a menu or at least check in with them and tell them it's going to be a couple of minutes before you could get to them. There seem to be a big deal going on about the drinking age and the daily $1 beer special and I just wanted some tacos for dinner. When I finally got a menu I picked the Tequila shrimp tacos and never actually got to order them. We had then been there roughly 25 minutes and no one came and checked to see if we wanted food/drinks. A waitress did manage to bring me some water. We left once we saw we were never really going to get served. It was a disappointing first time. Maybe I'll consider coming back during the day..."}
{"text":"The cowboy tacos are fantastic, the service impeccable, the decor different but cool and the ambiance was comfortable and really nice. Professional staff and great food!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this for lunch.  The Jerk Chicken soft taco was delicious and my mexican street corn was super sweet and tasty  :-)  I enjoyed the salsa but wasn't thrilled with the thick salty chips, they seemed store bought to me.  The sweet tea was perfect, the decor was busy but clean and the restrooms were well stocked which I appreciate.  It wasn't the most amazing mexican food, but it was tasty enough that I would return for another lunch."}
{"text":"Salsa here is delicious and fresh! Parking lot is small but you can easily find a space on the road. I've always tried their combo tacos. They are each unique. Sangria is good too!"}
{"text":"Ate dinner here tonight with wifey. I'm on the fence about this place, because I can't say anything good and I can't say anything bad. We went on a recommendation from a friend that told us about the Wednesday happy hour specials. The special was 2.00 tacos (chicken) and 3.00 Margaritas. Being wifey doesn't eat meat she got 2 avocado tacos (3.50 ea) and  ended up getting 2 margaritas. I got 4 chicken tacos and 1 margarita. Wifey really liked her tacos, my were OK nothing to write home about but how can you complain at 2.00. The margarita were also just OK but they were also just 3.00. I will not be rushing back here for the happy hour specials but I will go back."}
{"text":"I didn't give this restaurant five stars because I think there are better Tex-Mex places elsewhere in Charlotte. However, I implore you to try the Acupulco Cobb salad with the grilled Mahi Mahi. The seafood was fantastic and the portions are very generous.   The wait staff is kind. My husband and I really enjoyed the atmosphere as well. It has an eclectic vibe between punk and Texas. The chips and salsa are good but nothing out of this world."}
{"text":"Hidden gem.   Good service on a Saturday night, very lively place for a holiday weekend.  Taco's were excellent!   I recommend a variety and get a good taste of few off the menu.  As others have mentioned, the corn is a must as the side."}
{"text":"I go here once a week.  Staff have always been awesome.  Ive had mistakes happen (which is going to happen) and the service recovery has been excellent.  I always get a quesadilla with grilled chicken.  (it did suck when they started upcharging $1.50 just for grilling chicken) Otherwise, everyone is terrific and the food is right on.  Def give it a try if you haven't.  Oh! and in and out in under 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"Tacos and rock n roll! This is one of those reviews that I am pumped to finally be able to update. Why? Because I'm adding a star!  Four of us walked over here for lunch after bowling across the street. We started with queso because every Saturday should start with queso. I ordered went with a two taco meal, one jalapeno mahi mahi and one tequila shrimp. Both were good, but the shrimp was my favorite. I love the Mexican street corn. I always get it. They do have some vegetarian options, including falafel, fried avocado, and roasted cauliflower tacos. I'm not vegetarian, but I would order all three of those because they sound delicious.   This place has a great lunch menu on week days. The meals come with a drink and the most expensive thing on the list is $8. Such a great deal. They also have pretty good drink specials throughout the week.  My only problem with this place has been service. I still think there's a little issue there, but I think it is better."}
{"text":"Great customer service. A unique twist in Mexican food. I ordered the pork belly, Korean and steak tacos. All the food came out piping hot and the drinks specials added the this experience. I came with a party of five and all of our food came out fast considering they were packed. Would recommend to anyone wanted a cool Mexican thats a class of its own."}
{"text":"We went to maverick rock taco today for the first time and this will be our last time. We came in and they only had two tables in the whole restaurant.  We were excited to try it and we ordered 4 tacos.  After waiting for 30 mins for our food I got up and asked our server.  She apologized and said food was almost ready.  After 5 more minutes the food came to our table and was cold.  We weren't going to eat cold food so we left and will not be back."}
{"text":"The bartender (Stephen) is the nicest guy! He needs the bartender of the year award!! Every drink he made for us was on point. The pineapple mojito was my favorite until he presented a blackberry mojito, which is probably the best thing I've ever tasted. I haven't tried the food yet but the menu looks bangin. I'll be back tomorrow for sure !"}
{"text":"LOVE these guys!!  One of the managers, John, was INCREDIBLE in helping me surprise one of the guys on my team and his mother with drinks and apps.  He helped me set up this whole surprise, kept me posted on the phone and then texted several times to make sure it was done correctly.  What incredible service to help pull off such an awesome surprise.  Thank you, John, for going WAY above the call of duty!!"}
{"text":"Damn I love this place. MRT is one of my favorite places on Montford. After being here a handful of times, a review is a must. I always start with the queso because, well, its queso. Then my go to is always 2 tacos with a side. Do yourself a favor and go with the barbacoa short rib taco. The meat is flavorful and the drizzle of jalapeno crema sets it right. The crispy pork belly is another go to of mine. Pretty simple taco that lets the pork belly speak for itself. While at first I was thinking the taco needed a little something, I wouldn't want to dull down the flavors it has now - good job MRT for keeping it simple and sweet. As for sides, I have to admit I've never ventured away from my two favorites - the mexican street corn and the sweet potato waffle fries. Now, I guarantee their other sides are something to talk about, but why mess with a good thing. I mean, come on, mexican street corn is roasted corn topped with queso. WITH QUESO!   Other than that, the atmosphere is laid back and during warm nights the staff will pop up the garage door for fresh air. As we all know, parking can be tricky but that's what you get on Montford. Tasty margaritas as well and a decent bar menu that pretty much is the same beers anywhere you head on Montford. But seeing how I usually head here for dinner then hop to Angry Ale's for drinks, the beer list doesn't bother me. All in all, a solid place and definitely somewhere I'll be back to."}
{"text":"What I like about Maverick Rock Taco is that it's in a really cool area and it has a laid back vibe that serves really good food.  I ordered the Fish taco special for that night and I was over joined that they accomodated my request to not have a tortialla and brought it to me \"naked\".  The Mahi Mahi was delish and the quac was great!  The restaurant was clearly busy and you could tell that it's a popular place!  My only thing was that they brought out my white wine in a semi-dirty glass and it was room temp...say 70 degrees room temp.  :-( Oh well...I drank it and it still tasted good but just don't like warm white wine.    This will be a frequent place for sure for a quick casual bite during the week or a place to hang with friends!"}
{"text":"I would say this is more of a taco place than a full authentic mexican restaurant. We went for dinner and service was ok, it seemed we had 4 different people so sometimes was hard to get someone...maybe because the table was in the bar area. I liked they had so many unique tacos to choose from. I got one with shredded beef and it was amazing! I also got the pork belly and wAsnt a fan...I like pork belly and it was rubbery and even though normally fatty there was pretty much no meat. Cheese dip was good and the Mexican corn was awesome, that is a must if you are eating here. Their sangria they made was pretty good too. Will return to try more."}
{"text":"The other reviews are spot on. Sunday evening (about 6PM) Dawn and myself discovered Maverick Rock Taco by accident: we just happened to spot it while looking for something new. We were seated in the bar area and promptly attended to by the bartender/ server for the table. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some excellent suggestions.  We had the salsa trio app (tomatillo/ avacado, Roja and mango/ habenero). The tomatilo/ avacado was exceptional. The Roja was a bit more bland than I like, but a dash of hot sauce opened up the flavor. There was no 'heat' to the sweet/heat of the mango/ habenaro ... perhaps the spice was left out of this batch? For our entree we ordered six different proteins with a variety of toppings as tacos (chicken, steak, calamari, shrimp, vegetarian) IMPOSSIBLE to pick a favorite because they were all great: fresh, tasty and HUGE portions for the money.  The only drawback (and it's a pretty big one) was the atmosphere on this particular evening. We were seated in the bar area (We weren't told there was another dining area, just seated in the bar.) and had just received our food when a young woman decided to pay the jukebox. The music blasted out a hip hop song full of profanity and explicit sexual content. The music was loud enough to restrict conversation. There was a table of young twenty somethings seated behind us and they were singing along at the top of their lungs. Yike. Remember, this is about 6PM on a Sunday night. A server told us later that they had been there since opening and drinking all day. That experience really threw a wet towel over the evening.   We'll be back, but only during lunch next time."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. Service was good, I had the jalapeño margarita and it was good, but the food was just awful. I had the surf and turf. The mahi mahi  in the one taco definitely was not fresh, tasted really off, I took one bite and left it. The shrimp in the other taco was overly sweet. And the short rib enchiladas, which sounded so awesome, were cold and underwhelming. I don't think I will be back, unless it is only for drinks."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here! The food was very good.  I had a few drinks which were also tasty and unique. The service was good and fast! I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Friday night was my 1st trip here. I'll be honest, it didn't start out well. There were open tables all over the restaurant and multiple groups standing at the door and the hostesses were not exactly in a hurry to get anyone sat. They kept walking back and forth from the host stand not really doing anything. If there ever was a reason to use words like \"mosey\" or \"aloof\", these girls would be it.  The wait staff was super nice so that kind of made up for it. The food was very good and they weren't stingy with my margarita, although my friend ordered a beer and the glass wasn't filled to the top.  Long and short, The food was worth giving it a second chance on a week night."}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco spot in all of Charlotte! Since moving here, I have been on a quest to find amazing tacos, and rock taco hits the spot. I've been here numerous occasions and have never been disappointed. Some personal favorites are the Korean BBQ taco, tequila shrimp, chicken tinga, short rib and mahi mahi taco. I'm big on fish tacos and all their fish is fresh and not greasy after it's fried. Their spicy cilantro fries are delish, and the Mexican street corn is always a winner! Overall, it's a great little taco spot in Montfort that I can't recommend enough!"}
{"text":"We LOVE Tacos at this spot!  Their menu is awesome!!!!!  I got the falafel taco, skirt steak taco, & tequila shrimp taco.  All were so amazing!  My husband got the fried avocado, which was just ok.  But his fried fish taco was delish!  One must get item is the Mexican corn on the cob, it will seriously melt in your mouth.  And if you are up for drinks they have so many margarita choices to pick from.  As for chips & salsa, make sure to ask for the spicer salsa and also the salsa verde (they garnish it with a small scoop of guac...needless to say we devoured it all.  Next to Cabo Fish Taco this place is on par and up there with it, can't wait for our next dinner trip there!!!"}
{"text":"Maverick Taco is overall a great spot for a quick lunch. I've only been here for lunch -- and, always order the Maverick bowl. Shrimp isn't listed as one of the protein options but you can add it to the bowl. The service is great, food is always quick. Lunch special prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place! A group of us went here for dinner recently and all had a great time. The service was perfect - our waiter checked in with us often, but didn't hover around. We ordered different types of sangrias and every enjoyed theirs. Chips and salsa were decent - not out of this world good but tasty enough. I tried to season the chips with salt but our salt shaker was empty.   I ordered two tacos - tequila shrimp and buffalo shrimp, along with Mexican street corn. Last time we came, my boyfriend got the street corn and said \"we can share it!\" I had one small bite and the next thing I know, he had eaten the whole thing! I ordered my own this time and it was good. The sauce needed spread around the whole corn but that was easy enough to do. My boyfriend got the Texan taco, pork belly taco and Mexican street corn. He enjoyed his but said he didn't like the sauce on the pork belly and will next time ask for the taco without the sauce. Our friends ordered the fajitas (along with the street corn) and liked it a lot.   Good service. Good drinks. Good food. We will be back."}
{"text":"The Mexican street food is outta bounds"}
{"text":"It really was a pretty nice place, and I would give it an extra half star if that were available. I think the beer is a little pricey, but they had a pretty good selection of tap beers. Food seems okay, some of it quite tasty, but nothing special that I would rave about. Service was good and Unlike what somebody else said, the chips and salsa were free for the first basket anyway and I think they were better than your average Mex. restaurant chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I really don't have much to say about this place. I've been here 3 times before actually reviewing. Their patio is cool but the food is \"blah.\" If you're here to drink, awesome. If you're hungry and looking for some killer Tex-mex, you're better off going somewhere else in CLT."}
{"text":"One of the better Mexican places I've been in Charlotte. The atmosphere was great and our waitress was very attentive.   We started with a $3 margarita on special and the jalapeño margarita. The $3 one was ok, but the jalapeño margarita was excellent.  There was fresh, muddled jalapeños in the bottom of the glass. Spicy and delicious. We also had their guacamole, which was the best guacamole I've had in Charlotte yet. The salsa for the table was also great.   My boyfriend ordered the cauliflower taco and avocado taco with a side of plantains. They were both great, with the cauliflower being the favorite.   I ordered the short rib taco and the ahi tuna taco with Mexican street corn. Both were great with the short rib as the winner.   My only beef: the plantains and my short rib taco were cold. We had to ask for another of both. The replacements were waaaay better and quite good actually. I just wish that had happened the first time.   Great hangout and good good. I'll go back."}
{"text":"9 out of 10 times, yelp gets it right, in my opinion. this was the one time they got it wrong! when i looked up reviews for Maverick, it had a 3 star rating, and I was almost sure I didn't want to eat here... but am I glad that my hubby convinced me otherwise. The ambiance - so lively! on a Thursday night it was busy. mostly with bigger groups of 7-10 people. The ceiling is full of colorful lights, the music plays loud, and there's a digital JukeBox with the latest and greatest hits to take your pick from! Moving on to the drinks.. they have some neat drink specials, but I went with the Michelada. It was one of the best I've had till date. I got to try the chicken fajitas, which were somewhat non traditional. The dish doesn't come with the usual sides of lettuce, salsa, guac and sour cream.. instead there's a side of delicious charro beans, pablano green rice & Mexican street corn! I also tried some of the jalapeno mahi mahi tacos with a side of the spicy cilantro lime fries. a random interesting thing I noticed - they list all their vendors on the menu, that way, you know that your food is made from fresh produce and meats. I almost forgot to mention the friendly staff! Overall, it was a great experience, and I'm going back :)"}
{"text":"The pork at this place is the best, I love love love it... soooo good. The chicken is good, steak and beef were a little dry the few times I had. Brother had a salad and it was lacking in the meat department. The corn is really good, beans excellent as well."}
{"text":"Great food and great specials on 1-2-3 night. Margaritas were delicious but hard to drink more than one because the mix was too sour. Asked the waiter several times to turn the music down so we could converse at our table but he never did, not sure if that was his fault or restaurant policy but eventually had to move to the back of the restaurant to be able to carry on a conversation. Otherwise the service wasn't bad. Would go back here but not my #1 montford spot."}
{"text":"Visited this place with friends for Cinco de Mayo.  Understandably very crowded, so we waited at the bar.  I had the Maverick margarita, which tasted like a margarita should.  The bartender appeared to be a bit juvenile....I don't know if he thought he was flirting, but my girl friend stated that his banter may work on twenty something's, but not on women of our age.  Besides the bartender, there were two donkeys outside, dressed in tiny sombreros!  The donkeys were sweet and didn't try to unsuccessfully flirt with us.  Anyway, we were seated in under an hour, and, while we waited, we had chips and salsa.  Very average, but having something to snack on was great!  The bar area had a band and was noisy in general, so we were delighted to sit in the back area.  I liked that the menu designated the vegetarian items.  I ordered a dish that sounded so decadent:  three cheese quesadillas with spinach and portabello mushrooms, sour cream and quacamole.  They also came with a garnish of cabbage and tomatoes.  The quesadillas did not taste as special as they sounded.  In fact, one could not have picked them out of a dive bar quesadilla lineup.  Also, I had to ask our waitress for a glass of water three times.  Good thing I wasn't in the desert. About the decor......the walls featured pictures of rock musicians, such as Jimmy Page, Ozzy and Peter Frampton.  But, the music did not match the theme.  The genre was basically pop music of today, with a surprise song by Journey thrown in (oooooh, that was heavy!).  One detail that caught the eye of myself and my rocker chick friend was a stencil near the bathrooms that said, \"you are never too old to rock.\"  Photo op for us aging head bangers!  So the outdoor donkeys and the stenciling saved the day!"}
{"text":"Was headed to Duckworths but they were overcrowded and very loud.  Saw Mavericks and decided to give it a try.  Best thing I did today.  Both the Chicken Tinga taco and the Chorizo tacos are outstanding."}
{"text":"Bring back the fajita pizza! :) We used to come exclusively for this entree but sadly it's no longer on the menu. It's too bad that only a few people knew about it.  I'm not really sure why Maverick doesn't draw larger crowds. Chips and salsa are great, service has always been good, the pizza used to be one of my favorite dishes in Charlotte, atmosphere is fun (would be better with a larger crowd).. but I haven't been on a night where it was packed.   I've had not so stellar experiences like some of the recent posts but if you're a regular anywhere it's likely to happen at some point, and that's not the norm here. This is a great option for casual dining at a reasonable price and is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and love the food.  Especially the tacos and quesadillas.  Our favorite bartenders are Ciara and Sam.  We always get great service and would highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"So, some friends and I decided to stop in tonight & overall everything was ok...again. Our service was great, almost a little too much. Our waitress was at our table every second, somewhat too much. We enjoyed fajitas, steak tacos, and chicken tacos. The salsa and chips were good, but we got charged for a refill, really? And, two of us ordered a side of sour cream, for our fajitas, and were charged $1.50 for each. Ridiculous! I really wanted to give them a four, but right now I am just not ready, everything stick ok."}
{"text":"Another seemingly dead spot for restaurant in Charlotte. But this time i think it is more than just bad fengshui.  When everyone else is hopping on a Saturday night, no reason this place should be as empty as it was... Unless the reason is subpar service and even worse food.    The space is cute, I love the dimly lit by color string light atmosphere in the bar area.  We were greeted at the door by the DJ (didn't know they use the hostess stand as DJ booth until we were on the way out). We sat at the bar where it was virtually empty. Somehow it took the 2 bartenders a good while to acknowledge us. One was too busy closing out or something, which left the only other one to do the serving. She didn't have answers for any questions I had regarding drink special or food menu.   I don't even recall what we had, since I wasn't the one needing to eat. I do remember the calamari being the chewiest batch I have ever had. EVER! And I eat lots of calamari. I am sure there is a very simple basic way of prepping them in order for them to not be chewy. When the best things I got was chips and salsa and I am sure they weren't even homemade, it may spell the end of a tex-mex restaurant."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my tacos. Chips were good. Roja salsa was good.  A little quiet when we arrived, we were the only occupied table in the dining area. I probably should have moved to the bar area that seemed a bit busier, but what the heck.  $3 draft Dos Equis Amber went down nicely while we chomped on chips (and GREAT \"Roja\" salsa) and reviewed the menu.  My daughter opted for the gringo Mexican pizza but I'm sad to say that she didn't particularly enjoy it. It's huge but it just wasn't great. She only ate about a quarter of it.  On the other side of the table, I opted for tacos. I mean, it's in THE NAME. So I got a plate of two tacos. Number one that was the Jamaican chicken. Excellent with some spicy jerk chicken and sweet fried plaintains on there. Yum! And the number two was the Chickpea Felafel. Absolutely excellent with cucumbers and pickled oions and Greek yogurt. Both were very tasty and delish. For my side, I chose the \"Spicy cilantro lime fries.\" Tasty but not really all that spicy but the cilantro was sprinkled on top and the lime squeezed in there too. I definitely made out better here.  Several televisions tuned into the sporting events of the moment. Service was decent, even if we were the only folks at a table in the back area. Food took a bit, but fresh food cooked to order is gonna do that. No complaints.  Good vibe, good food, good service. It's good. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting a whole lot here. Food is okay. I got the avocado tacos with lettuce wraps instead of tortillas and they were nothing to write home about. Maybe a bit over filled, so they were hard to eat.  Had a boring queso fundido skillet (vegetarian), and the cheese didn't even seem fully melted. Disappointing. Served with soft flour tortillas. Meh.  The one highlight for me was the house margarita. Simple and delicious. I slurped up the whole thing.  Ultimately, I can't say that you should come here, but if you do, prepare for an underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"Where do I even start.. Alright. I typically like to give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to having a bad day.. but our server Chuck was the absolute worst.  My boyfriend and I decided to go out to eat. Typically we get two rounds of chips. When we asked for more chips with the queso, he gave us an attitude and acted like he had to do way too much work. I ordered the steak burrito and my boyfriend ordered the chicken tinga burrito. My burrito was as bland as putting three pieces of chalk in my mouth and my boyfriend said his burrito was just okay..Far from anything to write home about. Our drinks were never refilled and we were never checked up on. He came to clear out plates and didn't get us a check for the next 20 minutes. I showed my app for the free queso that was advertised after he brought the check and his eyes couldn't have rolled back any further into his head. And if they did, they'd get stuck for life. We finally spoke with the assistant GM and he was very apologetic and invited us back. First impressions are everything and this really killed it for me. I heard so many great things about this place but he ruined it. Chuck, I really hope you learn some great customer service skills and you're lucky you even got a 15% tip from us because even that was a stretch for us. I may be back but I will request that we don't get him as a server. Sorry, but not sorry."}
{"text":"Ok, so as we were waiting on an hour and half time for a lane at the bowing alley on Sat night on Montford we decided to try MRT. Menu looks good, place had a good crowd and it wasn't raining for once, so there were people sitting outside.  The waitress seated us promptly and the server came by for drink orders. We order chips and salsa, beers etc then our dinner. Food came reasonably quick was good but we had to ask for silverware and noticed a couple of other tables had to ask also. (Shouldn't the server notice that and bring it before we are server?). Overall the food was OK, not as good as Cantina or even Pacos Tacos but ok. What really surprised me was that the menu says the chips and salsa are $2 but they didn't charge us so I wonder if its free if you order food etc..The place was loud and the décor is nothing to write home about but overall it was Ok."}
{"text":"OUT OF THIS WORLD GOOD!!  So many options - So many Tacos!! And you can order all different kinds - as in singles - plus they are so little ordering 2 or 3 encouraged : )  The cilantro french fries are the best in town. The Mexican corn is good too, but spicy.  Best Tip about this place: They have outdoor seating, they have roll-up garage style windows if it's nice out.   *Side note, be sure to check out the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Excellent inventive tacos, I haven't had anything that wasn't very good here.  The Mexican street corn is wonderful, the pitchers of copper are a good price. Their pitchers suck however (from a physics standpoint) and will spill easily half a beer or more on the floor no matter how you or the waitstaff pours. After many a beer lost we found out there are a limited number of lids that fix the problem completely, ask for one.  Service has been either excellent or mediocre. (After we were told \"It's okay, it was all foam anyways\" while our waitress poured a good pint of copper on the floor while we shed a tear, unfamiliar with the specials we knew existed, Versus our skilled unflappable waitress who made sure we didn't spill on ourselves and handled a group of twenty voracious consumers of food and drink on her lonesome with constantly refilling pitchers, chips, drinks, water, salsa, etc etc.)  Edit: Since I bashed another taco place for not having it, praise for Maverick for offering free very good chips and very good salsa! Appreciated!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. The nachos were very gourd and the chicken burrito with the waffle sweet potatoes were to die for. Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"Mixed bag.  Habanero poppers were excellent if you don't mind a bit of heat.  My  mixed fish tacos were really tasty.   Mrs. S's \"Mexican Caesar Salad\" was absolute crap.  Just kind of barely there.  Stopped in the gent's room.... mistake.  I noted upon entry that another male occupied the restroom.  I vaguely made out is shadow and I called out a cheery \"hello in there\".   Message the Rock Taco management if you are checking reviews:  It is never under any circumstances appropriate to light your gent's rooms with 70s era blacklights.  No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.     Not cool dudes,  not cool."}
{"text":"I am going to make this simple. Flauta's, Blood Orange Margarita, Fried Avocado taco's. I can not have a combo like that anywhere else in Charlotte! For that reason alone I digress, this is my most simply stated review as of yet."}
{"text":"I have to admit, when Montford Drive was getting trendy, I was becoming less and less interested.  Mostly because of the pain it was to get over there and then the extra pain it was to find parking etc.  I must be getting older, but just having to deal with that doesn't really strike my fancy, but I digress.  Came here in a whim (mostly because Sir Edmond Halley's didn't open until 5pm on Sundays).  But no expectations and a hungry stomach.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The place was not crowded at all since it was 3pm on a Sunday.  There were some folks enjoying the weather on the nice patio they have here (fake turf and colorful lawn chairs made it look like those folks were having a grand time).  We were seated right away, and I could tell our hostess/server was the only one working (luckily we weren't in a terrible rush).  I got $5 bloody mary drink special and waited for our friend to arrive.  Chips and salsa were brought out right away so we had plenty to much on.    After our friend arrived, we tried to put in our order, but our server was so busy at this point.  There was a good little while before she came back to our table.  The manager came by and we asked to put our order in and she sent someone else (food runner) to take our order while  our server caught up.  No biggie.  I had the Jalapeno Mahi Mahi tacos and cilantro lime fries.  I was starving by the time the food came so I inhaled it in 30seconds... It was pretty tasty and satisfying.  I'll definitely come back to try the other tacos on the menu - they looked pretty interesting."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. I had never been in this building in any of its incarnations and was surprised at how big it was inside.  What I found odd is the separation between the bar area and the dining room which seemed like a mile between the two.  Anyway, I sat in the bar area because that's usually where the best service is and I was not disappointed.  The bartender was great at explaining the menu and beer selection.  For beers, they have a few on tap and then the rest seem to be in cans instead of bottled.  That might be done to save on space.  The menu is very diverse with several interesting taco selections.   One interesting idea was a calamari taco.  I would never order that since I don't like calamari but it was pointed out to me.  Instead, I ordered ala carte with a adobo chicken taco, a chorizo taco and a size of the mango jicama slaw.  The tacos were presented well and looked appetizing but they only flavor I got was from the corn tortilla and the sauce on both tacos.  When i think of mexican or tex mex, I think of bold flavors and there were none here.  The best flavor I got was from the mango jicama salsa which is a nice and fresh change from the typical beans and rice.    Another think I was I was slightly disappointed with is that there were no free chips and salsa like most restaurants of this type.  Bummer.    Anyway, I can't say my experience was bad.  The food was certainly edible and it was still 2 times better than the experience I had at a local mexican place last week.  So maybe I need to give MRT another shot and try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"A three star means I would try it again, but I can't say that I would. Mavericks has a rustic bar atmosphere with lots of TVs. Service was fine. The menu was very interesting and I chose the chicken tacos and fried avocado tacos (neat idea). I also had the white queso.   The queso was basically just cheese. It seems they could spunk it up with jalapeños or something. The tacos were ok, but they were served lukewarm. Even the black beans I chose for a side were not hot.    My friend said they had been there before and liked it, but I wouldn't risk taking a friend or meeting someone for a lunch appointment."}
{"text":"Tacos were decent, kinda pricey. Good live music from Wicked Powers and cheap beers on Friday night had me in a great mood!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The bartenders are the best and the Mexican pizzas are great! Ciara and Sam are so attentive and make awesome drinks. We always feel like we are VIPs when we come here and plan to return again many times."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place and I couldn't thank her enough. Good drinks and good tacos. We ate outside and got to choose where we sat. It was the perfect time in spring to be out there. Great waiter with fast service. Very accommodating to my substitutions. Awesome. I need to go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Friday night and was surprised to see that it wasn't that busy.  Our party of 4 was seated right away.  We started with some beers, chips and salsa, and some queso and chorizo dip.  All were good but pretty standard for a tex-mex restaurant.  I got two tacos (Carnitas and Chorizo) and the street corn that people have raved about. Carnitas - I enjoyed the fruit elements (pineapple and mango).  They paired well with the pulled pork.  The crispy onions were an interesting topping.  While I enjoyed them, I'm not sure what they added to the taco. Chorizo - Nothing not to like here.  This felt very traditional and was delicious. Street Corn - Honestly, I didn't love it.  Cheese and sour cream on corn.  I was wanting the crema to have more flavor.  Garlic, salt, some chili perhaps.  Naturally, I ate it all so it wasn't terrible.  Our server took really good care of us and was patient as we took forever to look over the menu.  The restaurant has a funky vibe inside and is basically split with the bar on one side, the kitchen in the middle, and restaurant seating on the other side."}
