{"text":"I had a curry chicken roti here.  Price was 5.75 and that should have warned me off this place.  In fairness, I was warned that the chicken had bones in it and I'm cool with that but to expect that I'd be picking through back parts and that 4/5'ths of the meat was infact bone.  Since there wasn't any potatoe or veggies, I spent my time sucking on what little meat there was while totally disregarding the experience of, well you know..  eating a roti.  Top that off with the well meaning but flustered waitor who was doing kitchen duty (who only works upstairs) and you can tell the employees are as displeased with how the place is run as the customers.  Oh and there was no debit card machine, so I had to wait another 5 minutes before someone could take me up to the buffet to pay my bill.  I went somewhere else after and ate a proper lunch."}
{"text":"A hidden gem that many overlooks. Place might look a bit sketchy but the food is amazing. For 6 dollars, you get a plateful of food. Unfortunately, I cannot handle spicy but I have heard from my friends that the jerk chicken is amazing! The BBQ chicken is my favourite. It is so tender and juicy and not drying at all. No knifes are needed when eating the chicken because you can easily pull it apart with a fork. I wish more people know about this place!"}
{"text":"A hidden hole in the wall with good food, big portion and good price.  Came here for their daily 4.99 special.  Perfect lunch portion size for me.  Others may not be able to finish.  Rice, chickpeas, coleslaw, plantains, quarter chicken.   They also have BBQ chicken if you're not a jerk fan. Very friendly service! Would return to try other items on the menu!  Downtown location but Scarborough portion, taste, and value!"}
{"text":"Going to school downtown Toronto at Ryerson this place made me happy. Though the outer appearance may look a little sketch the food speaks for itself. This place has a an amazing lunch special 4.99 and you get huge amount of food. When I mean huge I mean HUGE!! Out of all chicken this restaurant has I would go with the BBQ chicken. The jerk doesn't really taste like real authentic jerk and next up to the BBQ chicken is their fried chicken which is another great option. This restaurant serves it with a great portion of rice & peas, coleslaw, fried plantain, fried dumpling,chickpeas and potatoes. The amount of options they have are actually a lot, so don't be afraid to tryout new options.    Not sure if the guy who works in the front is the owner but he definitely hooks you up and is a really nice man. I would go there so often and bring my friends that he would give me even more food then what was already a lot in my eyes."}
{"text":"The only place close to Ryerson which serves kothuroti  Pros: -price -try mutton kothu roti without carrots and ask for crispy $5 -Nice family run bussiness -its Caribbean and Tamil food.  Cons: -presentation of food in the front could be better -seating area looks a little run down. -little confusing to the store upstairs."}
{"text":"You know how some little dives tend to have the best food !! Well , this one isn't one of those. Dirty looking and the food looked and tasted like it had been in the warming trays all day long. The stew beef was in some sweet weird gravy and tough as nails , the chicken was tender but a little bland.  I have eaten at a dozen places like this in town ... save your money for a place like Alberts."}
{"text":"Yay, I'm definitely a fan! This Caribbean eatery is located just a few steps away from Ryerson and offers delicious food for an affordable price! There's a decent-sized seating area although you order/get your food at the front in styrofoam boxes and the employee was accommodating (told him I didn't want it to be spicy so he gave me BBQ sauce on my jerk chicken).   I ordered a medium sized jerk chicken combo, which costed me $7.90 (tax included) and it was very filling. It's definitely a fair meal for a fair price, especially because it stays within student budget. The jerk chicken was tender and flavourful, just the way I like it! It had a tinge of spice but overall, it was tolerable and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was given a hefty portion of rice and beans and coleslaw, which was awesome. A few things I was confused about, probably because it was my first time having it: the plantains were surprisingly warm and had a dough-y texture? and the so-called \"dumpling\" was actually just a piece of fried dough.  Overall, I would recommend you drop by this place if you're looking for a satisfying, filling, and affordable meal."}
{"text":"Its super hidden and I almost missed it a few time. I've only had their lunch special ($6) and it comes with an array of things. Its not the best Caribbean place but its not bad and its a really good deal. For the chicken, you have a choice of jerk, BBQ, fried, and baked. The meat on the jerk chicken really falls off the bone and its a good expected spice level. I found the fried chicken a little too salty on some of the skin bits though. I like that you get a bunch of extra stuff like chick peas, greens, and the bread thing. It's a nice variety that you don't normally get from a typical Caribbean place. As three stars would indicate, this place is A-OK and its good enough for me."}
{"text":"Great value for your $ here.  Can't beat the $4.99 lunch combo option with 4 different types of chicken to choose from.  Jerk, BBQ, curry and one more that I forgot at this time but they just load it up with so much food it's amazing how they can even be profitable. Jerk was blend but for those of you looking for low sodium option,  it's a good choice.  Will be back to try more.  Very generous portion and decent quality of food."}
{"text":"Came in here for the Jerk Chicken lunch special.  $4.99+tax got me a giant piece of delicious, moist, flavorful jerk chicken, a giant pile of beans & rice (make sure to get the curry sauce from the curry chicken ladled over the rice, it's so good), 2 fried plaintain pieces, a big scoop of coleslaw, and a piece of fried dough (forget what that's called).  It was enough food for 2 people, seriously.  I couldn't finish half of it.   Really good overall.  It was quick and tasty and filling. And CHEAP.  Just a note they take cash only, so if you only have visa/debit like I do, you have to get the receipt and go to the restaurant upstairs to pay with their debit (owned by same people). Not a huge deal."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick bite for lunch and saw this pop up in my Yelp search. I'm always looking for a good carribean food, so I thought i went to check it out. I ordered the $5 special, which contained rice, curry chicken, plantain, a dumpling, and chick peas. The food itself was alright. nothing exceptionally spectacular, but for $5, you're easily getting your money's worth. i'll definitely come by here again either for the lunch special, or to try out their roti which also seemed reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Narrow, hard to see place connected to an Indian buffet on Yonge. This is definitely a dive; the smell, look, and atmosphere urge you not to stick around. The saving point is the price; food is cheap, plentiful, and surprisingly tasty. Obviously not the best I've ever tasted, what you pay for is what you get. $7 tax included for a hefty portion of jerk chicken, coleslaw, chickpeas, plantains, calloloo and beans and rice. There's a decent variety to choose from and service is efficient."}
{"text":"I stopped here to get some Roti after doing my nails downtown.  They were receptive to my requests and the food was great.  I bought enough to bring home."}
{"text":"This place is such a lunch-time gem. The food is tasty, filling, and affordable! In terms of Jamaican food, this place is better than Ritz down the street and there's much more variety.  This is not a fancy restaurant so don't let the appearance deter you! If you pay with card you have to go to the upper level with your recipe to pay at the bar - again, not a fancy place but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"After trying out TKRE, I had given up hope on the prospect of indian street food rolls but was pleasantly surprised to learn about Roti roll that opened up close to Yonge Dundas square. Although this place seems more west indian than authentic indian, I took a chance and stopped by to try it out based on a couple of reviews I read from fellow yelpers. Unfortunately this place was even worse than TKRE. The place is definitely unclean with house flies all over and I almost felt like walking out at that point. They are clearly not ready for primetime yet. My order of chicken tikka roll took 25 minutes when it's supposed to be street food that can be prepared quickly. The guy working the grill was clearly sweating with the high heat around him and the woman working alongside clearly was doing something else rather than helping out to prepare my order. I don't think this place can survive with the absolute lack of passion on their part. The only saving grace was that they were very flexible with how the roll was assembled. I asked them to put cilantro in the roll and they obliged w/o any issues. The chicken itself was artificially colored and tasteless (rather huge chunks as well), the omelette that is supposed to wrap the inside of the roll was broken and burnt and the chutneys did not do anything to add life or spice to this boring assembly. The mint chutney was watered down and lost all its flavor in the process. If you don't care about how your food tastes (bland) and need a cheap filling roll, then this place fits your bill. Sadly for me, I have a high bar (Kathi Roll company in NYC) and this place does not even come remotely close to it. I am not sure how the rest of their menu tastes, but it looked equally unappetizing. Please avoid this at all costs if you are in a mood for rolls."}
{"text":"I've been going to Roti Roll semi-regularly, and they're keeping up the quality. I'm not sure I've ever had another meal quite as good as my first one - generally they don't have green salads. Their jerk chicken and BBQ chicken are comparable in quality to the stew chicken, which is really good. It's still lots of good food for a good price, but I've realized that for whatever reason I'm never too excited to eat here, so 4 stars seems more appropriate."}
{"text":"Roti was hot and delicious! Came here late afternoon during the week to grab food to go. Got the curry chicken roti with callaloo. It was yummmmmy, paired it with a ting drink. It was conveniently located in the downtown area where I was staying. Food was well seasoned, hot, mostly meat not a lot of potato. Will definitely return during my next Toronto visit."}
