{"text":"Our Trading Room has this practically every Friday morning. Very accommodating for the amount of people we have in our office. Fast and efficient and great food!"}
{"text":"Pacific Benedict,  delicious, but only complaint, which I'm sure everyone would always agree with,.....one more slice of salmon would have made it perfect. ... but then again, there is never enough salmon in any meal when you go out to a restaurant....is there?

Still fantastic."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and the food is absolutely amazing! A bit out of the way tucked behind a stairwell in the +15 it's well worth the adventure to find."}
{"text":"Holy good food!!! That's all you need to know, really that's it. Nothing negative about this place, everything was awesome"}
{"text":"Very good burger! Fat patty. Loved the brunch burger with a sunny side up burger and big portion of fried."}
{"text":"One of my favourite breakfast places downtown, the food is delicious and the prices are reasonable, which is tough to say for most downtown restaurants. Great spot to meet someone before work, fast and tasty. I had the Sausage Nicmuffin, which was a great breakfast sandwich. For those with a huge appetite, you'll likely want two sandwiches, which  is still very affordable, one was enough for me."}
{"text":"FOOD: Good quality breakfast and great portion. I tried the Pacific Benedict with Smoked Salmon and my husband tried the Wakey Wakey breakfast with smash browns. Their hash browns (or they call it, Smash browns) were so crispy that I'm still thinking about them today.  

ENVIRONMENT: It took us roughly 15 minutes walking in circle on the street to find this restaurant. Until we got help from a security guy inside an office building, we then realized the restaurant was actually on the 2nd floor. As a tourist, I thought this was a true hidden gem. So hidden, we almost missed it. The space is open and modern. Lots of windows and seats.

SERVICE: Friendly. You order at the front counter and grab your own seat. Once the food is ready, they will buzz you to pick it up. It was a bit quiet when we were there so the staff brought our food to our table."}
{"text":"I was excited to see Holy Grill open up near my work. I met up with some fellow downtown workers for lunch today and was a bit disappointed in the food quality. I remember eating at the first location a couple of years ago and at the time, Holy Grill was  delicious. 

Today, we ordered three different types of sandwiches/burgers. Here's the short of it - the inside of each sandwich was over cooked and the buns, rock hard.

The long of it, for those of you who desire details, is as follows. The meat in the \"gourmet burger\" was rock hard and not fresh tasting. The patty in the veggie burger was lack lustre. The avocado breakfast sandwich filling was the best among the three. The crispy bacon was a bit exciting. The worst part, common to all three orders, was that our kaiser buns were hard and very cold - like straight out of the fridge cold. I prefer my buns toasted so imagine my dismay! In any case, I have faith. I will give this place another try because I want it to work out. 

As usual, the staff they've employed are pretty awesome. The interior is completely new and pleasant. Lots of San Pellegrino fizzy drink options."}
{"text":"Get there early for lunch at the 5th Avenue as they fill up fast.  Fantastic sandwiches & burgers.  I had the Italian panini and loved the added touch of cream cheese.  In already looking forward to my next visit.  You will order at the front and the food will be ready to pick up at the kitchen very quickly after that.  Excited to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Holy Grill is a great lunch and breakfast space, I frequent the 5th ave one as I can get to it through the +15's from work, it's a bit of a walk but I can definitely use the extra calories burned getting there and back for the deliciousness that I enjoy once I am there. You order at the front and then get a table after, they have buzzers to let you know when your food is ready. The tables are often all full when I get there but they open up quite quickly as people are pretty courteous about others waiting. 

For breakfast I usually get the classic bacon and egg sandwich, it comes with a pickle which is delicious and you can add extras like spinach and pickled hot peppers. They have an avocado breakfast sandwich as well which is fully loaded and delicious but a bit much for me that early in the morning.

For lunch the ranch burger is a great option or the salad is especially good if you're looking for something a bit lighter, either way you need to get the sweet potato or beet chips on the side with the chipotle dip, so good!"}
{"text":"I knew this place was there but never went - I've been to the beltline location. Got a burger and fries take out and it took a little longer than I expected but worth the wait. Got the \"Super Burger\" it comes with fries. Good burger, good fries - couldn't do it everyday as price (if I got a drink it would have been the better part of a $20 bill) and health wise but a nice treat. They have canned pop (ick) and a bunch of hipster teas and stuff. got a bottle of Coke at the store around the corner."}
{"text":"I'm going to say it, best burger in Calgary without having to leave downtown.  Downtown is a sea of corporate restaurants frequented by sales guys with expense accounts who don't know how to procure a fine burger with fresh ingredients.  Or you can find a Wendy's in every second building.  Holy Grill's downtown location (is mysterious to find in the +15 network) but well worth the lunch time hunt.

Awesome people, great service, awesome sides, and I like the open kitchen to see how it all goes down."}
{"text":"The food is simply delicious! Super fresh! Great restaurant quality! The chefs are very friendly; I would say the only drawback is how slow they are at times when you're looking for a semi quick lunch. Get there early cause the lines are nuts at noon."}
{"text":"A very cute and clean place on the second floor; you can take either the elevator or stairs in the back. We had a quick early lunch here and enjoyed the atmosphere and the food both. Had been recced the New Californian by a friend and it lived up. Who allowed this orgiastic explosion of flavorful vegetables in my mouth? Filling and so good. The beet chips are also crispy and slightly sweet and amazing with the house dip."}
