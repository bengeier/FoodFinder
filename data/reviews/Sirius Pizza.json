{"text":"I had Sirius Pizza at a recent charity event. Apparently the owner, Carol, is all about giving back to her community. Just for that reason she deserves my repeated business. This will be my new local pizza place. Everything is fresh, they deliver, and the menu is huge - they have more than just pizza. Grinders, handmade burgers and homemade potato chips are just some of the offerings. Don't pass up this local gem. Support a business that deserves it!"}
{"text":"So after watching several hours of The Tudors on Netflix today, we decided to get a pizza delivered....  We decided to try Sirius after trying it once before at a friends house  - The General Tso's Pizza which wasn't bad - anyway we settled in on \"The Sombrero\"  taco pizza.    We were told it would be ab out 45 mins, but it took almost an hour 15 before the delivery guy got to the house.  The pizza was okay, but wasn't the best that I have ever had.  I might give them another shot....we shall see...."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has closed and is out of business. In the same location is now a barbeque takeout with new owners."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in after a short walk from our nearby hotel for a meal dining in. We were, quite honestly, a little fearful when we entered the establishment due to the decor (best described as 70s Goodwill), but we were immediately won over by the smell of the place. It smelled of yeast, fresh dough, tomato sauce, herbs and more. We were further encouraged by a gracious welcome at the cash register.   The dining room consists of just three or four tables and an old covered sofa. Clearly this is a pizza house that does a busy delivery business and very little in-house service, but we were pleased to see a wall covered with thank you notes from local elementary school students spanning more than one year.   After discussing the menu with the gal behind the counter we decided on a galactic pizza and a dozen hot wings. A mere 15 minutes later we were treated to a truly tasty dinner. The pizza was topped with fresh ingredients in good proportion, and the large wings were cooked to crispy perfection.  We would absolutely recommend this gem to others, and when we return to the area we will surely visit again. It really is unfortunate that the business seems to be so focused on delivery... with pizza this good, a dining room makeover would surely attract a steady business of family diners."}
{"text":"I just went to the shop today after having the pizza they kindly donated to the Badges for Bullies event at the CPD union hall last month. Even though they are struggling in the very difficult small pizza shop industry, I speak from my own experience, they proudly donated tons of pizza and wings to the event.  We went tonight with some friends from a local animal rescue, and 1 of the detectives that broke up the dog fighting ring several months back.  At first glance the place looks small and lacking in decorations but, remember they are a mom and pop shop. Don't let it fool you, the grinders and other food that passed by us when we were waiting on our food looked and smelled delicious. Finally our Greek Pizza and breaded mushrooms came. The pizza is probably the best pizza I've had in a long, long time. The crust was perfect, brushed with some seasoned oil. Perfectly crisped. The mushrooms are made in house and are worth every penny. The batter is seasoned and very tasty.   I've never done this before but I was scooping up any remnant of pizza that may have been left on the pan, it was that good. I will be returning often to try the other creative pies they have, like the General Tso, Chicken Paprikash, and to many more to list.   Don't pass this place up, stop in and try some food, you won't be dissapointed.."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, service was even better. Delivery was quick and the pizza was intact!! Not stuck to the top of the box. I'll definitely go here from now on since, Georgios doesn't answer their phone, doesn't deliver before 4 pm, and are very rude. WTF, I'm paying for the pizza!"}
{"text":"After wading through clouds of cigarette smoke from their cooks/drivers standing out front and waiting for 15 minutes in the tacky dining room for my order that i called in an hour beforehand, finally got our pizza. Over all the taste was OK but def not worth the price. There's a million better pizza joints in Cleveland- dont waste your time/money here."}
{"text":"I was going to try a place called Goodfellas Pizza and go on a whole Jersey Shore rant. But i decided to support one of my favorite businesses instead. I had the Sunrise today. Whipped eggs and peppers on pizza makes a good breakfast when waking up at 3 in the afternoon. The Atlantis and Eastern star were tasty on my pre-holiday visit in November. They have added a couple new specialty pies since i first came here.  Today i got to chill on their couch and read letters on the wall from local kids. They thanked Carol for donating pizza to their schools. This place is very cute and unique."}
