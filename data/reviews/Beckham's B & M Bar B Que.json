{"text":"WILL NEVER BE BACK! I went 2 months back and at the last minute asked for a side of sauce... the girl was quick to be sure and charge me $.50 for it. Got home with my to go order and NO SAUCE. Called and explained she said she'd put it in some book to get it next time. I go today ordered a 3 piece wing special. Told the lady I was do my sauce I didn't get prior. I even had that recipe in my wallet and told her I talked to Dionna. She said if its not in the book I'll have to pay. It wasn't in the books. Then she said Dionna isn't a manager so she couldn't promise me my sauce I paid for prior. I said ma'am I don't work here so how would I know who's who? Then I said why would I lie about a 50$ sauce. Told me I still would have to pay. I threw my recipe down and told her I won't be back. And I won't! Lost a customer over 50Â¢. And sure that amount won't make or break me but B & M has more money than I do and there's a principal here. THEY screwed up my initial order that I PAID for and now treat me like this?! Hey I will spend my money elsewhere no problem! Great customer service lady!"}
{"text":"Below Average.  I ordered a wing dinner and it was OK. The coleslaw was extremely watery/runny.   My chicken wings were floating in what ever the liquid was from the coleslaw.  Wasn't really appetizing.  The fries were cold and kind of dry. They were very skimpy on the sauce.  Wings were old.  Skip this place!"}
{"text":"I came across this place while driving through Cleveland. The sign said it was the best barbecue in town. However, my experience said otherwise. It is always difficult to write a somewhat negative review, but I have to be honest.  First the customer service was lacking. I was put on hold in the middle of ordering for the woman taking my order to answer the phone.  Mind you that was right before the order of the man before me was lost. I am not a clean freak, but the restroom was atrocious.  It took a while for me to get my food and when I did it was not good. I ordered the rib tips and they were hard and crunchy.  The yams and fries were good though, which was a plus since I could not finish my rib tips. I wanted some dessert, but they were out of cobbler and the cakes in the case did not look too fresh. There are cool pictures with the restaurants owner and celebrities all over the walls. I had a lot of time to look at them because it took so long for my food to come. Given the many better dining options across the city I will probably not be back."}
{"text":"I was super starving and was in the area. Rib tips it would be. They were so good I took a knee. I would eat them in a box, I would eat them with no sauce.
And I will eat them with a fox.
And I will eat them in a house.
And I will eat them with a mouse.
And I will eat them here and there.
Say! I will eat them anhywhere!

They were some of the best tips I have had. They were tender, smokey and amazing. This was some good Q."}
{"text":"We stopped here while we were in between soccer games at Force. The food was really good. They had a nice selection of breakfast, sandwiches, BBQ and desserts. I'm a vegetarian and got an veggie omelette. It was cheese, onion, tomato and green peppers. It's was delicious. My daughter is gluten free so she got a hamburger (sans bun) with fries. It was a nice size and she liked it. My son got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were yummy. Hubby got a pulled pork with cole slaw. Overall, this place was a pleasant surprise. The woman that took our order and the woman who gave us the food were really nice and helpful. We will be spending the next 8 weeks with both kids having games at Force. We will definitely hit this place again."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing here! This particular building is less than one years old. It's more spacious with a better layout. The food is still the same! The chicken wings are nice and juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside. Normally I would get a Polish Boy, but this time I stuck with the daily special. They now offer spicy Polish boys, maybe tomorrow I will try it out. Overall, this is a mecca for the city of Cleveland! You cannot stop in to my city without trying A local favorite! The sauce is amazing! Most people have their wings Carbert in the secret sauce, I like to dip my fries and chicken in the sauce. The ribs are OK, but everyone knows I come here for the chicken wings. I gave this place four stars instead of five, only because customer service was not the greatest."}
{"text":"I do wish I would be in this part of town a little more. B &M BBQ is the reason! This is definitely a place that for me is a treat. I'm breaking all diet guidelines and m definitely not counting calories. 
This restaurant has dine in and carry out. Because I am on the go so often, I carry out. Today my order was enough to feed an army. I think I nearly ordered one of everything. 

I ordered bbq pork sandwiches, slabs of ribs, coleslaw, fries with bbq sauce, and cornbread. My mouth waters as I type. Needless to say, each of these items were nothing short of amazing. 
Cleveland has some great BBQ. I would absolutely recommend trying this place. The carry out is convenient and so is the location. They are near I-480. Good eats for sure."}
