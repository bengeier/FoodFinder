{"text":"Brio is always a happy dining experience.  For this specific location, I've only been for happy hour, but I don't see how their regular menu would differ from their location at Town Square.  

Their happy hour must be one of the best!  They have a list of items for $2.95.  Don't let the price fool you though.  Their portions are decent sized.  We always order one of everything, and maybe even two of some other things.  (Don't judge us!!)  How could you not though?  Cheap, good food is so hard to pass up!

Their service is always amazing.  They check several times to make sure everything is okay and refill drinks before it is necessary."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  I've been there 5 times now and have left completely satisfied each time.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and has indoor and outdoor seating as well as an indoor and outdoor bar.  Since Brio doesn't take reservations, you'll often have to wait a good 30-45 minutes which is plenty of time to get yourself is peach bellini (yes, it's girly and frothy) which is wonderfully refreshing and not too sweet.  The waiters are all very attentive, even when the place is slammed, which is a nice change from the LV norm.  

Food wise: the bread you're served upon seating is piping hot and delicious; the lobster bisque is amazing; the brio chopped salad is great (but I recommend getting the balsamic dressing over the red wine); caprese bruschetta is delicious, as is the roasted red pepper brushetta (blanking on the name); and those mini desserts (creme brulee especially) are the perfect endings to a great meal."}
{"text":"Oh sweet, sweet Brio.  I absolutely love this place.  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  Yes, it's a chain, but I definitely give props to a restaurant chain that makes food as delicious as Brio.  There are no negatives or neutrals about this place.

+ Wonderful service.  Our waitress was so nice.  She helped me make a decision on my meal and she was very knowledgeable of the menu.  Also, the other employees were happy and spunky.

+ You can add or modify your meal as needed.  A lot of big restaurants (especially more expensive ones) don't allow you do personalize your meal.

+ FOOD.  Oh my goodness.  If you want a meal that is flavorful, cooked right, and unique, you have to try this place.  I ordered the Mushroom Ravioli and it was the best meal I've ever had.  I could taste the different cheeses, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and it melted in my mouth.  My mom ordered a chicken dish and it came with two large chicken breasts and vegetables (she substituted rice for veggies).  Of course, I'm vegetarian and can't eat meat, but the veggies were ridiculous!! They were so delicious.

+ Prices and portions.  Yes, the prices are a tad high, but the portions make it worth it.  I had ten large raviolis stuffed well with mushrooms.  It could easily be split into two meals.

+ Creme brulee.  They have about eight different kinds of creme brulee to choose from.  I ordered the chocolate cake, the original and caramel.  Fantabulous.  Spectacular.  Even if you don't eat a meal here, you MUST try their desserts!!  It will be the best thing you ever do for yourself."}
{"text":"The food is very good and I really like the ambience.  Lots of choices for trying to eat vegetarian and they're willing to improvise the menu if there's something you want. I'm still not sure about it's location in Tivoli, which appears to be a shopping center with only restaurants (?)."}
{"text":"Weird servers. I dont know how else to say it. We have been there 4 times with 4 different servers and 3 of them have just been some of the weirdest people I have ever had to deal with. I think my waitor I had last time used to be a mime because of the way he was using his hands. The food is the only reason why we come back because its pretty good and we always know what to expect."}
{"text":"Hands down! BEST HAPPY HOUR in town!! 

What a steal! 

Have to try the Shrimp Eggplant!"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch with Kevin and Tim. The soup of the day was yummy.  Perfect for this kind of weather.  The shrimp diavolo could be a little spicier but overall, it was fantastic. Great lunch but love their happy hour prices better."}
{"text":"Love Brio! We met a group of friends for Happy Hour last Thursday. Exceptional HH menu with a very nice selection of $3.95 small plates and several wines and mixed cocktails below $5.  We had several rounds of appetizers (definitely try the shrimp and eggplant dish, the flat bread was popular with the guys).  Everyone appeared very happy with their drink drink selection. Service was good and the bar was very busy. No wonder!  Good job Brio! When will you be in La Jolla, CA?"}
{"text":"Dinner here on a recent Thursday night was very pleasant and enjoyable. A bit pricey, $71.30 for two, but you often get what you pay for. No complaints. My husband's Filet Brio was melt in your mouth perfect, accompanied by fresh sautéed spinach and roasted butternut squash. My lasagna came with two sauces, pompadoro and Alfredo, a generous portion with plenty to take home for another day. Lobster bisque for starters, a shared glass of the house Cabernet , and a shared Creme brûlée for a satisfying finish. Service was attentive and friendly. We will certainly come again, but probably save it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Mediocre food complimented by a mediocre staff.   I'm 50 years old and CAN'T STAND HAVING SOME 20-SOMETHING WAITRESS CALL ME \"HUN\" OR SWEETIE....it's condescending, patronizing, rude and thoroughly unprofessional.  Brio should train and manage their staff better, at least enough to make up for the very average food."}
{"text":"Two different pasta dishes...both too salty.  margherita flatbread was totally bland.  And for God's sake will someone please tell the servers here, and everywhere else that I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU'RE FAVORITES ARE!!!!  Just describe the food and the preparation."}
{"text":"To all that get to read this. I was recommended this place for lunch I'm an employee at the this mall. I was watching my weight as well as others I recommended there to order a kids meal . At first we were discounted which I don't really need . But the manager who's there was so freaking rude and mean when we picked up our food. He said that we are not allowed to discount for us anymore. Fine that's ok i still wanted my portioned meal anyways I was really will to pay  anything. When my employee went for pick up the manager who's there was unprofessional disrespectful and rude . He said he will not serve us anymore. We order from them for team building meetings and events . Well no more I will never recommended this  place to my clients or employees.  Listen food was good but not worth the hassle to have a portion meal so sorry we want to be healthy."}
{"text":"Ate here last night on the outside patio. It started to rain during our appetizers right after the staff took the umbrellas down due to the threat of high wind. Tried to put umbrella up but staff insisted it stay down even though no wind at the time. Rain stopped and we finished our meal only to find that the manager had removed the appetizers from our bill as a courtesy. With that sort of service, I can only recommend Brio to everyone who lives and visits Vegas - way to go, management!

P.S. About the food:

Lamb gorgonzola - perfection!
Mussels - delightful!
Lasagna al forno - fresh pasta, meat, and sauce - enormous portion and very tasty!
Salmon salad - had to take half of it to go."}
{"text":"Brio is unexpectedly great for several reasons.  They have good food, especially taking into account the fact that they are a chain.  The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful- comfortable booths and drapery hanging from very high ceilings, beautiful colors and lighting (bordering on ornate, but in a good way).  Outside is equally beautiful, including tables and chairs that surround firepits.  They have nightly happy hour (3-6pm, 9pm-close) and really good bruschetta apps with different toppings (shrimp, mushrooms, etc).  Their penne fra diavola with shrimp is delicious (spicy tomato sauce), and they have nice shrimp and crab cakes.  There are nice salads, pastas, chicken, seafood and steak dishes on the menu (Tuscan Italian style).  Their desserts are all available in mini sizes, which is pretty awesome and rare.  Good wine list.   They also have a nice weekend brunch here.   Reservations are a good idea on weekends or you will be waiting well over an hour to sit down.  It is not the best Italian food of my life, but the food is always delicious and the atmosphere is great.  I especially love this place on summer nights, sitting outside."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Very big restaurant, makes you feel as youre eating  in Italy :-)
...and deserts are to die for!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot! There are big, circular booths in the bar area that are perfect for a group of girlfriends after work. HH drinks are between $4-5 and appetizers are about the same and perfect for sharing around the table. 
The place doesn't have a ton of personality, but the food, drinks, and service are wonderful."}
{"text":"Brio is located in Tivoli village off of Rampart and Alta.  It is probably the longest standing restaurant in Tivola as many others have gone out of business or relocated since Tivoli opened (Petra, Radio City Pizza, etc).  The ambience inside is comfortable.  The service was attentive and helpful.  The food was okay, but could have wowed a bit more.  I had the lamb chops which were inconsistently cooked (some rare, some over), but the flavor was good.  My partner had the beef medallions with asparagus coating.  These were also pretty good, but nothing I would return for.  Overall, I think Brio was a good one time experience for me, but maybe I will try out their happy hour after reading some of the other reviews."}
{"text":"Been here twice and they have yet to disappoint me. Ordered the fish special, blackened ahi with vegetables. I usually don't ordered blackened fish, but it was perfectly seasoned and cooked just right!"}
{"text":"After not loving our first experience at Brio, we visited for a second time with some friends to see if things had improved. There was nothing particularly wrong with our experience, but it wasnt mind blowing either. The service was adequate and we enjoyed dining outside. The bread given as a starter was good and my wifes Caesar salad was tasty. I ordered the seafood pasta and three of my clams were not opened, they could recognise this before sending it out. My pasta had way too much sauce and the fish was almost invisible. One of the meals came out with the wrong noodles but they apologised immediately and made a new one quickly without fuss which was great. It feels like Brio is trying to be upscale but cutting costs on the food. There are several Italian restaurants in town where the food is spectacular and while Brio is decent, it doesnt meet the level of some of these other places."}
{"text":"GREAT happy hour! Drinks are $5 the peach sangria is my favorite. I tried their strawberry mojito and that was not good at all. Also a good variety of happy hour appetizers to choose from. I wish they could incorporate more items that aren't fried. Very spacious and clean. They also have the best lobster bisque! I can never remember which pasta dishes I get when I go for lunch/dinner but I have never been disappointed. They also have an outdoor seating area. 

My boyfriend and I have a favorite dish there which is the seared steak salad or sometimes for a healthier version we substitute it the steak for salmon. great mixture of greens and the dressing they use is so delicious. A good amount of food for the price you pay. 

Comparing it to the TS location I believe this is a little smaller but I like both. No complaints!"}
{"text":"i'm a regular at this place and its about time i wrote a review. 3 words. yum, yum and yum."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful and the food is pretty good depending on what you order however the service is crappy. I've been there several times and a couple of times the waiters were just terrible, not friendly an all, seemed like they were bothered to answer questions on the menu and just couldn't wait to get out of there. One time we had a woman waiter who was just rude, another time we were sitting outside and a male waiter just couldn't get anything right on our order. While we were ordering it seemed like he wasn't even listening to us and everything came out wrong, some things completely forgotten, salad that was supposed to be no onions had onions, steak medium was well done etc. Had to have everything redone. Disappointing."}
{"text":"3 stars for an average restaurant, but just a warning, the chicken marsala is gross.   It's a grilled chicken breast with what appears to be a glob of gravy from a jar plopped on it.  The gravy doesn't even taste good."}
{"text":"Valentina was absolutely amazing. She was incredibly attentive and made our experience delightful! The food was delicious as always!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for Happy Hour. I have tried everything on the menu and it is fabulous! I love sitting outside on the patio too so it has a great ambience too! Love this place and have brought friends here that enjoyed themselves too!"}
{"text":"Architecture is beautiful,  the food is delicious, and the service is always top rate.  Perfect Happy hour location - great prices, quick service, and good appetizers.  So good we usually stay for dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and shared the crab cakes as an app (between 2). VERY good. 
My girlfriend wanted a pasta that was only on the dinner menu (we were 30 mins early for that) but the kitchen did it anyway. Everything was good including service."}
{"text":"Have had many good meals here. Great service. Tonight was not one of them. We ordered Grilled Lamb Chops and Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecco. Sauces didn't melt in and the meat was very tough for both meals. Sorry."}
{"text":"Firstly, I will say that our server Austin did a great job, and our lunch was very good.  

Unfortunately, what would have been a great experience turned negative quickly.  I watched a waitress REPEATEDLY go to the banquet side of restaurant and play with her eyeball in the mirror.  I don't know what her issue was, but it didn't stop her from bringing bread and tea to her tables without washing her hands.  So gross.  I considered speaking to a Manager after to let him know how grossed out I was.  Right before we left, I saw what I later learned was the floor manager go to the same banquet room, remover his shoe play with his laces, put his shoe back on, and then put his hands in the window to kitchen to pull food to be run.  How fricking nasty??!"}
{"text":"a great restarunt lovely service management is excellent ! beautiful decor spotless ... love the pasta. and salads! they r deelish try the parm dressing ask. for extra ! when ur. done. walk down to see a movie what a fun night ...."}
{"text":"What a beautiful place, went for happy hour great prices, nice portion sizes, beautiful presentation, the staff was friendly an attentive, the food tasted amazing, couldn't of asked for a nicer time, the chef was amazing, very professional, would definatly recommend this place an take out of town guests... Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Just ate at Brio at the Scottsdale Quarter location. We love the food - my favorite is the steak salad - but the service is slow. Turnover seems to be high - we've had a different wait staff each time we've been here - and the training is lacking. My waiter tried to take my plate away before I was done eating and didn't even ask if I was done. We waited forever for our food and forever to get our check. On the way out, our waiter actually cut me off and stood in the way to pour a glass of wine for someone else. It was quite a disappointing evening."}
{"text":"I live in Rancho Cucamonga and we found one out in Vegas while on vacation. I love this place! We had the best server ever! She even brought me my own personal coffee pot. I always order the filet with double vegetables and Its the best I've ever had! Love it here"}
{"text":"I wish YELP would change the definition of 3 stars from \"A-OK\" to \"Just OK\" since they don't have 2.5 stars.

I was shopping in Town Square and Brio looked like the only non-fast food choice for lunch.  The atmosphere, decor, and service really deserve 4 stars.  They loose 1.5 stars for the food.

I ordered a large Caesar salad, and a Mediteranean Penne dish.   I had the option to get a small salad with the entre for an additional $3.85, but the waiter said it was pretty small so I asked for the large salad entre (which was supposed to cost a whopping $11.00).   The salad came in a large plate which was half empty.  I love Caesar salad, but this one was mediocre at best.  Hardly any flavor.   And the description bragged about the house dressing and brioche croutons  - both tasteless.  When I finished the waiter asked how I liked the salad, and seemed very surprised when I told him that it was bland.   The only good news was that they didn't charge me $11,00 for the salad, but only $5.00, though I don't know if this was because of what I said about it.

The penne dish was pasta with mushrooms, dried tomatoes and fetta and a very little bit of a tasteless sauce.   This is one of those places where if you ask for parmesan cheese, the waiter makes a show of grinding it on your pasta.   I suppose they want you to think this is entertainment, but I think it is really just a way for them to save money on cheese.   As you watch, they grind and grind and grind, and when they're done you may have a teaspoon or two of cheese on your pasta.   For what this dish cost ($15.15) they could have put a dish of cheese on the table - it might have helped an otherwise boring meal.

The only bright side of lunch was excellent sour dough bread which tasted like San Francisco sour dough, but they told me it was shipped in daily from Los Angeles.

$25.00 plus tip with ice tea.   I think I would have done better at Olive garden."}
{"text":"My daughter and I consider Brio's our favorite for happy hour.  Birthday celebrations, Mother's Day and New Year's Eve dinners have also been so enjoyable at Brio's. Food and service are always great. Unfortunately our latest visit was Interrupted with a medical emergency and Gabrielle and Michael's assists were beyond what one would expect. Michael was able to considerably ease the stressful situation. Other professional staff members joined the effort to minimize the problem. So I can't say enough good about this restaurant. Don't miss out, try them out!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Went for Valentine's day and me and my boyfriend were so pleased. They have great customer service & the food was delicious. They have a cute outside patio where there are dining tables set up. The food came in a timely manner even though they were super busy. I was very very happy that this is where we spent Vday! Plan on coming back often! I ordered a pasta with chicken, bacon, and spinach in alfredo sauce - my boyfriend had a pasta with lobster and shrimp in it. It was literally perfection on a plate! Not to mention the roasted & artichoke dip that came with it was TO DIE FOR. I loved it. With those three plates it came out to be about $65"}
{"text":"I am giving a 5-star rating solely in hopes that they continue the great jazz music during happy hour, and get more of it more often. The outdoor terrace is perfect for it this time of year. The music is the only reason I would come here. 

Like most reviewers point out the food is average, but you get your money's worth during happy hour. Alot of old farts here..I am surprised they can drink so much. I had no idea."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend for happy hour. supposedly there were hot chicks here.

The food SUCKS bangladeshi taxidriver assholes. If you want to know what a bangladeshi taxi drivers asshole tastes likes...please try brio.

Brio is basically the mcdonalds, or wendys of italian food.

The crowd here is on the trashier side. The one at tivoli has the same shitty food, but with a more prosperous and much older crowd. The good news is tivoli has live music in the summer. I will probably be going there for *drinks only* whenever they have music."}
{"text":"I've been twice . Happy hour in the bar was great, drinks and apps prices great! They pour good liquor and it was fun...visit 2 for dinner. Service was good , food was ok, atmosphere ok too. However the prices for this food is ridiculous, it's very clear that the rent is so high they have no choice! I don't mind paying for a good meal, if it's really good. Sorry N O R As  smokes this place on the Italian food, why go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Brio is one of the nicest places in Town Square, especially when you can seat outside. I was there at  least two times a week but recently they reduced the menu and left out some of my favorite meals. So disappointed..."}
{"text":"Hubby had $11.50 Berry French Toast with White Peach Palmer tea ($3.50) and I had Small Chicken Brick. Both choices were very good. Nothing particularly memorable otherwise."}
{"text":"I have been here two times.  Same server - same (unpleasant) service.  He was training someone else, but himself was incapable, slow, forgetful, unprofessional - just not what you would expect from a restaurant that is trying to be a Scottsdale classy place.  

Ambiance: Nice. Classy.  Enjoyable.  Baby Friendly. 

Food: Decent. Smaller proportions.  I like their tomato creamy sauce and bruschetta . 

Service: Below average."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my lady at her request.  Nice ambiance, Overwhelmingly delicious food and presentation by the chefs.   We started with the insalata caprese, which was fresh with a very balanced dressing for the greens that came atop the salad.  I had the crab crusted salmon and basically wiped the plate clean.  She had the sweet potato chicken risotto, which she found to be delectable.   Our only qualm was that the service was underwhelming to say the least.   It should never take 20 minutes to get water on a table, our server never checked back on food satisfaction, and we had to grab another employee to check us out when we were finished with dinner.   For as staffed as the restaurant was, the front of house did a major disservice to the kitchen for the evening.    5 stars for food, 1 star for service."}
{"text":"We have been visiting this location since they opened, celebrating birthdays, anniversaries, etc. at least 10-20 times a year.  We were here on May 7th celebrating my mother-in-law's birthday.  The appetizers were pretty good but the entrees were definitely lacking.  My husband ordered a chicken Caesar salad and they served him a side salad and brought him a piece of chicken as they said they forgot to put it on the salad.  The salad was on a very small plate and that's how I knew that there was no way that this was a dinner salad.  The fact that the chicken wasn't even on the salad was another dead giveaway.  My son ordered the salmon it was overcooked and it was a very small piece and wasn't worth the $23.  I ordered a side lobster tail and six pieces of shrimp.  I have food allergies and I asked that they steam both, and not add anything to it. Well they grilled both and it was overcooked and very dry.   It definitely was not worth over $200 that we spent.  I'm not sure if we will be visiting this location again.  Very disappointed in the quality  of food that was served."}
{"text":"My fiance, my daughter and I went here on Easter Sunday to try something new. I heard a lot of good things about This place so we decided to give it a try. To start I had the Bistecca insalata a nice wedge of lettuce with Gorgonzola, bacon, and a great Parmesan dressing, my fiance had the chopped salad which was okay. My daughter had the kids pepperoni pizza which turned out to be the hit of the night,  its a rather large portion for kids and it tastes fantastic, compared to the two pasta dishes we had. Both were Penne noodles which were bland as well as the chicken in the pasta carbonara, there was a complete lack of flavor and the sauce seamed to be breaking up. My fiances Pasta Diavolo was nothing to write home about either, the \"spicy tomato sauce\" was not spicy or flavorful, and again the chicken was bland. If i ever do go back to brio i will try some of their grilled meats, if i can afford it the whole menu is way overpriced. I do here they have a great lunch menu though. Overall Booh-tay!"}
{"text":"Came here for my daughters birthday dinner.  Everyone liked their food, the service was excellent.  My food could have been better but I should have went with other people's recommendation who have eaten here before.

Let's start at the beginning. We ate on a Saturday night using a reservation for a party of 8 (easy breezy).  We were sat very quickly after checking in.  If we didn't have so many people it would have been perfect to sit outside.

After our order, the food came out within a reasonable amount of time.  The portions are generous and you could probably share, in fact if you are craving more than one thing, I would probably suggest having on person order one dish and the other person something else and then sharing.  Especially if you order Chicken Milanese and Lasagna for example.  You get two nice pieces of chicken when you order the Chicken Milanese.

If you order the way Brio normally makes Lasagna it will come out with mostly Alfredo sauce and some Marinara (red) sauce.  Ask for it in all red/Marinara  sauce.  That's they way most of my table had it and they were happy.  I had it with Alfredo, not that it wasn't good, but the creaminess of the Alfredo kind of softened the great taste of a traditional Lasagna.  I would have been better off ordering it the way everyone else did."}
{"text":"This is my favorite casual lunch dining restaurant. I've tried a few items on the menu, but my favorite by far are the Bruschetta Quattro appetizer and the Steak Salad. Many times, that's all I order! The quattro gives you 4 different selections of their famous bruschettas and you get 2 of each one, making it a perfect sharing appetizer (genius!). I'm not a big fan of salads myself, but I LOVE this salad. The steak is prepared medium-rare (again, not usually a fan of bloody steak) but this is fantastic. Of the 10 times that I order this dish, its always just as good as the last. The dressing complements the steak, and the blue cheese, cherry tomatoes, and walnuts put it over the top. We always order it split, so we can share it was well.

My fiance and I have come to Brio many times, sometimes for a light lunch before seeing a movie, and even one time for an impromptu valentine's day lunch date ... She and I could have gone to a fancy fine dining establishment, but there is just something about Brio and its amazing food and outstanding service that is hard to pass up. The only downside, if you can even call it a downside, is the pricing. It's not totally ridiculous but it is pricey enough to make Brio a twice a month visit, if that."}
{"text":"Im Italian and try not to eat italian food unless its a home cooked meal and this place reinforced my opinion. I will say this, the people who havent had real home cooked italian food seemed to be enjoying their meals. The place was clean and our server was good."}
{"text":"A solid 4.5 out of 5! The food here is awesome, it's well seasoned  resulting in great flavor and it's soft texture indicates they are fresh ingredients. The place provides a delightful atmosphere with outstanding service and very friendly staff. 

The .5 deduction  is due to a very minor detail; which can be easily overlooked. It's not a big deal, however my wife and I noticed it. Some of the staff reached over our food to service the other guests. Other than that, the places is great!"}
{"text":"Reservations don't seem to matter here.  Waited almost an hour after our reservation time.  I made the reservation nearly a month prior.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"Brio is A-OK. Really nice patio seating with great friendly service. The chopped salad was decent...fresh and well dressed. The eggplant pomodoro was ok...could hardly tell the cooked-to-death mush inside was once eggplant, but it was edible. The pasta it came with was very good, perfectly cooked with a very nice balance of garlic, seasoning, and oil. Next time, I'll have a simple pasta dish; they seem to know their pasta. The desserts were very good. I had the mocha pannacotta, and my friends had tiramisu and choc lava cake...all very, very good. 

I can't give it more than a solid 3-star rating (this review ain't bad overall...it's just that mushy low-flavor eggplant that's sticking in my craw...maybe when I go back I'll be able to push it to 4 stars if I'm a big fan of whatever I order then). Still, it's a decent enough eatery at a decent enough price to go back."}
{"text":"Brio surprised me with their fresh, delicious food and large portion sizes.  I've been to both the Town Square and Tivoli Village locations, and both are quite pretty inside, reminiscent of the Cheesecake Factory in style.  

My favorite starter is the spicy shrimp and eggplant: shrimp over romano crusted eggplant in a black pepper cream sauce, amazing!  

For entrees, the lasagna bolognese is HUGE and very delicious, it could easily serve 2 people!  It's layers of noodles in a bolognese sauce topped with alfredo and romano/mozzarella cheese, yum.  If you're looking for something lighter, I would absolutely recommend the grilled salmon salad.  The salmon is cooked perfectly, and sits atop spring greens, asparagus, tomatoes, feta cheese, and crispy shoestring potatoes in a balsamic vinaigrette.  The combination of textures and flavors is really delicious and satisfying, without being too heavy.  The only entree I haven't liked here was the shrimp verduta.

The kids menu is quite impressive as well.  We ordered the salmon ($6.95) for our daughter, it came with a large piece of grilled salmon, mashed potatoes (or sub french fries in our case), steamed broccoli and a drink of her choice.  I could have made a meal of this, it was delicious!  They have other options: chicken parmesan, grilled chicken, lasagna, mac and cheese, burgers and pizzas.  

We've ordered catering from here in the past, and it is a great deal!  We ordered the lasagna bolognese, the lobster and shrimp fettucine (shrimp and lobster in a spicy lobster butter sauce) and the pasta brio (penne pasta with chicken, mushrooms, and a roasted red pepper sauce), all for $160.  It comes with a tray of fresh bread, a tray of their crispy flatbread, and we also had a coupon for a free dessert tray with a $100 order.  They gave us a generous serving of their tiramisu.  Each tray serves 6-8 people, and we had enough for 14 people with tons of leftovers.  Everyone had a different favorite pasta, so it was enjoyed by all!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love going to this restaurant.  The risotto entree is fantastic, and the fried calamari app is one of my favorites.  Service is always good and the atmosphere is really nice.  Prices are steep so I don't get to eat here often, although I would if they had better lunch specials.  They do have happy hour deals but I can't usually take advantage of them."}
{"text":"The Decor is NICE , staff was nice and attentive. Food is amazing . This is one of my favorite Resturant ."}
{"text":"We've had many meals at Brio and usually enjoy the food.  The ambiance is pleasant and you can't beat the outside patio on a nice day.  We went several weeks ago after the lunch rush to sit outside and enjoy the sun.  Service was fine, but we were disappointed the the pasta dishes we ordered.  My husbands pasta was lukewarm as was mine.  Mine came with grilled chicken and vegetables - those were hot, but not enough to compensate for the barely warm pasta.  And as for the grilled chicken on my pasta, it had the flavor and consistency of something that came from Sysco or US Foodways.  I'm not saying it was, but it definitely didn't taste like it was freshly cooked in house.  The bread and the butter was delicious.  The wine was excellent.  We'll go again as it's part of our neighborhood restaurant rotation, but I'm not sure I'd order the pasta again unless we were assured it would be hot."}
{"text":"Just thinking about the lobster bisque makes my mouth water.  My food was excellent, the service was great too.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went to the bar and that was the coldest expressive I ever had. Waited for a long time for someone to ask me what I wanted. The bartender woman was just fake, some brunette girl. When I wanted to pay I kept looking at her and she never attempted to even care about me as a customer. I don't know her name because they don't have nametag and she never introduced herself. I ended up telling another person to please get me my check. I'm a local and not coming back."}
{"text":"This place was good. I had a bad experience with another wok type place so i decided to give this place a shot. The food was so tasty and the place is absolutely stunning. The staff was so kind every time I needed something. The manager was even going around asking how all the tables were doing. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Took my daughters here for a nice lunch on a Sunday.  It was aesthetically appealing and service was fine, but the food was appallingly bad.  The chopped salad we sent back because the greens looked old.   My flatbread was cold, tasteless, and the texture of a matzoh.  The mushroom ravioli was inedible, overspiced, salty and cold.  My caprese salad was passable, but short on both olive oil & balsamic vinegar, with an anemic tomato.  For over $60, a complete bust."}
{"text":"the food was good
the service was excellent
free parking at the meters in the evening, not sure what time that kicks in though"}
{"text":"The service is great and the food even better. I am not a huge pasta fan, but this restaurant converts me into one while I am there. :) I have eaten here for lunch and dinner multiple times and have never been disappointed. 

I would recommend a menu item, but I don't think you can go wrong with anything you pick!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful New Year's Eve dinner. The service was outstanding with great food, good wine list, and excellent menu choices. Compliments to Chuck who was our server."}
{"text":"Beware if you are gluten-free.  Waitress said they had gf crackers in the basket.  After I ate one, she came over and asked if I was \"alright!\"  Said she made a mistake about the crackers.  They are NOT gf.  This waitress did not pay attention to anything.  She would disappear for 10 minutes at a time.  Good thing we were not trying to catch a plane or a show.  Very poor service, but more importantly, they should train their staff to be more careful with gluten free customers."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for Italian food. Expect to wait for a table specially on weekends but service is good and food is the best"}
{"text":"Diners beware should you choose to order the creamy spinach/sausage bruschetta. The bread is hard, not crispy and the sausage was nowhere to be found. The waiter said the sausage was chopped. I'd call it invisible. If not for TWO small pieces (about the size of half of a dime) there was no sausage. Good size pieces of grilled red peppers though. Quite frankly a waste of money and the word 'sausage' should be removed from the item's description. On the bright side, the lobster bisque was great!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, lousy food.  I have only been here once on a Saturday evening.  The hostess was pleasant and we were seated outside relatively quickly.  The weather was great; it was a nice environment to have dinner.  The waitress was serviceable.  She made mistakes, but it didn't distract from the mood.  However, the food was a disappointment.  My Filet mignon was served at room temperature, well done (ordered medium rare), poorly seasoned, and dry.  The waitress swung by and asked how was the temperature of the food, which is a weird way of asking how is the food.  I wanted to enjoy the mood with the family so I didn't say anything.  Since I was given an opportunity to correct and didn't, I was not going to penalize the staff - gave 20% tip and left.  As we were walking around I was told both the Lamp Chops and Beef Pappardelle were also cold and dried out.  We were served old food.  A kitchen should never let three dishes go out in that state.  The side dishes and drinks were all mediocre.  

There are plenty of good restaurants in this area.  I'll not bother with this one again."}
{"text":"Lovely interior but average to below avg. food and definitely over-priced for the quality of the dishes.
This was my second time at Brio - first time was lunch and food was fine (Strawberry/Chicken salad) but service (for 2) was terrible! It took 40 min. & 2 inquiries after ordering to receive the salads. At the time I thought, while the salads were good (not great or unique) it wasn't worth the wait or the high prices, though the restaurant itself is lovely. Also, I had to ask for a table that wasn't next to the loud clanging of the open kitchen so my friend & I could talk without shouting.
So, 8 mos. later my 17 yr. old wants to celebrate his birthday where? Yup - table for 5, dinner, please!
I will say the server was very nice & very accommodating. However, once again we found ourselves seated right next to the open kitchen & we were told all the tables for 5 were by the kitchen - so we shouted over the din (restaurant was only 1/2 full?). So, with entrees from $18.95 - 23.95 we opted for the \"Dinner Special\" an all-inclusive 3 course meal (3 entrees to choose from) for $16.95 ea., (beverage extra) and the ravioli appetizer. 
The appetizer was delicious - only 4 large ravioli for $14.95 though and the Chicken Milanese ordered by 3 of our 5 was enjoyed. I tasted it and it was good. My choice, the penne diavolo w/chicken tasted like spicy cheesy-Mac with tomato sauce mixed in - not great at all. Our other guest had the strawberry-chicken salad and enjoyed that.
However, it was agreed that basically it's Olive Garden at twice the price in a better neighborhood. If you want authentic, true delicioso Italian food I recommend Roma Garden - same prices, not a pretty neighborhood but mamma mia, it's authentic! Or any other favorite place you love for Italian - Brio is not for foodies or anyone who wants to talk at a meal."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for a long time and have heard great reviews.  At 130p on a Friday there was a 20 minute wait.  BUT...there was a table in the bar so we opted for that instead.  We sat down and ordered and were very excited about the atmosphere.  We ordered the ravioli for an appetizer, OMG delicious!  Superb!  Amazing!!!  We then moved on to the Italian wedding soup- Yikes- something went wrong.  The orzo looked like rice and was in clumps on the bottom of the bowl.  It was so salty I could not even eat it.  I had to return it.  There didn't seem to be a problem with that and our waitress did take it off the bill.  Oh by the way, I had to ask 3 times for more butter for the lovely flat bread and sourdough they place on the table.  Also, my friend had to ask twice for hot water for her tea.  The service was slow, forgetful, and not so friendly.  So, let's get back to the food.   I had ordered a flatbread which was basically a totinos pizza. yuck!  I had 2 corners and my friend took it home with her to take to work for lunch.  I would rather spend 99 cents for a cheap frozen pizza than eat at this place again.  Maybe a little happy hour with the ravioli- but nothing more..."}
{"text":"Highly recommended, nice place, very clean, great location. Nice service. Close to a lot places around , very nice atmosphere around the holidays."}
{"text":"Even if you are not a fan of chain-restaurants, this is one to try. First tried has Brio's in Las Vegas and got excited when I move to Chandler and found there was one close. The \"Artichoke Crusted Beef Medallions\" dish was like butter! They also have a great patio with heaters, but they get pretty busy on weekends."}
{"text":"Non-smoking establishment, despite the outdoor bar area. Food is unmemorable, service is fine, plenty of alternatives nearby."}
{"text":"We went to have brunch at Brio Tuscan Grille on a Saturday afternoon.  They are one of the many restaurants in Town Center Square shopping area.

We arrived a little after 1pm and noticed it was busy, lots of people were standing around waiting.  So we went inside and I asked the hostess how long the wait was and was told 15-20 minutes.  She asked for my name and phone number and we went back outside and browsed some nearby shops.  We came back and sat outside at a bench by the restaurant and still didn't hear anything.  I checked my phone frequently and made sure I had my ringer on. More time passed, nearly an hour and we went inside to see how long the wait would be.  The hostess looked up my name on a computer and another hostess immediately showed us to a table.  We realize it was busy BUT if we hadn't checked back with the hostess we would still be outside waiting to hear my phone ring.  So why did the hostess bother to get my phone number if they weren't going to call in the first place?  We felt our time was wasted waiting around for a call.  Maybe they should invest in those pager things that other restaurants give out that buzz and light up when your table is ready.

The food was pretty good.  We ordered lobster bisque, my boyfriend had an omelet and I had the stuffed french toast with berries.  Our waiter was an older gentleman who picked up on the fact that my boyfriend was pissed when we first arrived.  He was very attentive and had a calm and playful manner.

So I would give the food 4 stars, but because of the hostesses lack of hospitality and indifference I have to give Brio Tuscan Grille 3 stars."}
{"text":"Brio is one of great Italian resturant I been in vegas great pasta and fettuccine food is just great and great service I do like location which is they have outdoor"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite! The pork chops are to die for and the Sangria keeps me coming back. Servers are sometimes hit or miss but the food is worth the trip :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! I visited Brio a few weeks ago on a Thursday night for dinner! The staff was extremely courteous and friendly and the food was great! We ordered the crab cakes to start; they were the best crab cakes I've ever had! The Pasta Fra Diavolo with shrimp was very good as well! 

The interior is bright and airy and our booth was private and spacious! I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Always great service and the food is wonderful. The ideal place to stop into if you are out shopping in Crocker Park."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with work colleagues. All of us ordered a different lunch combo and they were all ready very quickly. Food was good, order was correct, and service was prompt."}
{"text":"This was one of our go to restaurants but probably not anymore, the past 2 meals here have not been so good. Last meal had their version of chicken piccata and the chicken looked like it was coated in a scrambled egg and was super soggy- yuk. This past friday my husband and I both ordered the chicken milanese and it was not only just mediocre in taste but then as a bonus both my husband and I got very sick after eating this meal. We felt ill later that evening that carried on through the entire weekend. Never again. The food took a long time to come out and the restaurant was not that busy."}
{"text":"Hopefully someone who is gluten-free by necessity reads my reviews. Amazing, delicious, incredible are the words I would use to describe the gluten-free Chicken Pomodoro. I ate it all and the only thing that would have made the meal total perfection is a gluten-free baquette. Seriously folks, I would pay extra just to be able to reach into a bread basket, slather it with butter and then swipe my bowl with the crust."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and have been very impressed. First time was for dinner; great food! Second for drinks; very strong!
The service is the one thing that really stands out. Every member of the team always has a big smile on their face and they are very polite and helpful during interactions. 
I will definitely be back and highly recommend Brio to everyone in Vegas. 

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch today for my kids last day of school, we sat in the patio and the weather was beautiful.  Everything we order was pretty good, server made us feel uncomfortable at the beginning just because we want to put in the kids order right away before we order our drinks.  It was a half day at school for our kids with no lunch so they were very excited to have lunch at Brio!  I ordered the salmon dinner for my daughter and it was over cooked, she didn't touch it. We requested the burger to not be over cooked and it was good like we asked, however our server seemed annoyed when we asked him to let kitchen know not to over cook it.     My kids eat out all the time and they know how to eat well.   I ordered the three course special and it was great!  Overall lunch was good but be better if our server was a little friendly with kid's request."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering for pick up- it is NEVER ready when they say it is and you'll end up waiting three times as long like I always do. Parking is impossible and there's no lot within a comfortable walking distance. Food is mediocre and nothing to rave about, but this place gets PACKED at lunch time on weekdays so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"While Brio has often done a very good job with their food, it was slightly disappointing on this visit.  While I enjoyed the Lobster bisque and my wife enjoyed her Brio burger, our 4 year old kid's menu pizza was very much underdone.  The staff service was prompt in addressing the issue. 
The service was good as usual!
The Brio burger had applewood bacon that made it a very good burger and the lobster bisque was nice and hot!a. Our dessert consisted of the mini Tiramsu cups and they were very good!  Even our daughter's taste buds Have evolved to enjoy such a unique flavor"}
{"text":"Food was fabulous! Came here for a late mothers' day dinner, best service I think I have ever received at a restaurant. Great job guys !"}
{"text":"Excellent dinner! The service was impeccable right up until we ordered desert and again when we wanted our check. Then it was as if the waiter forgot about us for 15-20 minutes....Other than that one negative, the food was absolutley amazing! Every one of our dinners was delicious. (We all sampled each others) The appetizers and deserts were incredible as well. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I love Brio!  This is a favorite place to gather with girlfriends.  The food is always great tasting and the service is quick and polite.  Their lobster bisque is delicious!  I love getting their lunch lasagna and salad...perfectly satisfying.  My friend had her baby shower here - we were able to order a bunch of small plates and everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Management was very unaccomodating for minor requests in regards to large party reservations."}
{"text":"Wow! What an amazing experience! Food was excellent and our bartender Brandon was incredible. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The experience was a bit rocky.  It was nice to see the place so busy on a late Wednesday night however, it seemed to me no one was communicating.  When we arrived, they told me it would be 10 minute wait.  We waited more like 20 minutes before getting seated which is ok but we had asked for a booth and they tried to seat us at  a round set for 6 when there was two of us in the party.  Directly across from the table was a dirty booth.  
After being sat, 10 minutes go by with no sign of service.  When we did finally get someone to the table, he dropped of bread and left without one word.  We watched server after server walk by without anyone coming over.   A table that sat down after us (across from us) got service well before us.  It had to be at least 15 minutes until our waiter arrived.  Once he got there, he apologized for the wait.  It was smooth sailing from there. 
For a chain restaurant, the food was good.  The Harvest Salad had great flavors however, needed more cheese.  
I think I will sit at the bar next time.  May be the service there will be better."}
{"text":"First time visit.  3 of us had Danny R as a server and he was terrific.  Excellent food and service!  Manager came by to check on us.  A chef brought out our appetizer.  They had is at hello! Lol"}
{"text":"Great time!! Our waiter, Max was amazing!! He gave great suggestions on the full meal and helped with the happy hour menu. We will be back because of the crazy good food but also because of the great service!!"}
{"text":"If you're craving Italian, this place is a must. We made last minute reservations for a party of 20 and I was glad they were able to accommodate us on such short notice. When we got there, we were seated immediately and was presented with the most sweetest waitress ever. I'm so disappointed that I forgot her name!

I am a huge fan of Marsala sauce so I went with the Grilled Chicken \"Under the Brick.\" I requested extra sauce and I was not disappointed. Even my daughter of 6 enjoyed it and you know how it goes when it comes to children. As for my other half, he got the Chicken Milanese. He's a simple kind of guy and way pickier than our daughter, but he cleared his plate with \"Wow\" in between bites. Let's just say it's now Pomodoro over Marinara any day.

I also love the fact that this restaurant is in the heart of Town Square, my favorite place to shop. And shall I mention the interior? It's so beautiful! Definitely bringing another crowd to this place again."}
{"text":"Blame it on our beautiful weather...we opted to sit outside on their patio.  It was such a lovely day..topped off with a perfect meal.  I chose the Shrimp/Crabcakes and they were delicious.  The service earned an A+.
We are looking forward to their weekend brunch in the near future."}
{"text":"Took wifey for lunch, OMG, it was wonderful, Nicely done,great food,service and atmosphere 
It's nice to be pampered 
Thanks"}
{"text":"Went there this weekend and I would have to say I will go back every time I'm in Vegas. Simply delish. From the wedge salad with a yummy dressing, to my flirtini, to the pasta alla vodka. The pasta alla vodka was the best pasta dish I have ever had. The service was amazing. Nothing bad....at all."}
{"text":"The food was great, the only thing I didn't like was the time it took for my server to refill our drinks"}
{"text":"Best place to get lobster bisque. Staff is friendly. Alway great service. Come one, come all. If you are in the San Tan Village area I highly recommend checking out Brio's Tuscan Grill."}
{"text":"I was last at Brio Tuscan Grille in this location in early February and gave it a 4 star review.  I went back today with an old friend who has also greatly enjoyed this restaurant many times in the past.  We were both very disappointed.

I had the Shrimp Mediterranean just as I did, just one month ago, in February.  This time, instead of ample perfectly cooked stalks of asparagus, there were two or three small cuts off one spear.  Instead of an abundance of  fresh vegetables cooked to perfection, they were sparse, limp and not very fresh tasting.  The orzo was unimpressively prepared.The shrimp was still  good.

My friend had the special which said it had scallops and eggplant among other listed ingredients....I think it included rissoto.  While the scallops were perfectly prepared, the rest of the meal lacked any significant amount of egg plant and other listed ingredients.  She said it tasted like all tomato.  The eggplant was her main attraction to this menu item and was grossly underrepresented.

This is the only time we have ever had a coupon, but I do not think the sharp drop in quality was because of that.  There was some confusion in applying the coupon that required some kind of a card or a phone number despite having printed and presented the coupon received in my e-mail.

The bread and lavosh were still excellent, as always, but the dessert selection was not as imaginative as usual and did not tempt us enough to order.

I hope this was an anomaly, rather than the new normal.  We have enjoyed this restaurant in the past."}
{"text":"Love Brio!  Great food and great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my new favorite place! Just had my bridal shower there! Matthew was  great and also was Kimberly!!! Outstanding service! Exceeded my expectations!! Food was also out of the world!! Everyone was so pleased and they were beyond accommodating! Thanks guys! You're the best!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a very late dinner at 11pm with hardly anyone in there thank goodness. I've tried showing up at 6 or 7pm but there was over a 30 minute wait so reservations are a must during this time.
I had the vodka ravioli which was excellent with creamy sauce and my friends shrimp & lobster fettuccine was  also deliciously flavorful. The beef carpaccio was okay but extremely large and the lobster bisque was good. The waitress showed up a little late but once she got there she was great. I would definitely come back here again but may try happy hour on my next visit since it can get pricey if you order food like I do!"}
{"text":"As one of the major new restaurants in my area, I've been wanting to try Brio since it opened, and I'm glad I did - I was very pleased!
-- Roasted red pepper and mozzarella bruschetta was very good...my only complaint is that it could have used a little more balsamic, and the mozz was a little greasy. I personally would have done a mix of mozz and goat cheese but, hey, I'm not the chef.
-- Chopped salad was okay...chopped lettuce, cucumber, tomato, onion, olive, and feta in a nice, light dressing
-- Pasta alla vodka...highly recommended! tortellini stuffed with ricotta in a spicy tomato cream sauce, with basil, crispy prosciutto, and garlic for that special added kick of flavor that makes this dish unique
-- Chicken limone...your standard picatta, but with two huge breasts of chicken and a side of yummy pasta (although the pasta was a little cold)
-- \"Dolchinos\"...small servings of desserts...we tried the key lime pie, which was yummy, but it was the bananas foster creme brulee that evoked a WOW!
All-in-all, I'm very pleasantly surprised by this chain restaurant. Lovely dining room, attentive service, and great food at moderate prices (figure $25-30 per person)."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter who they staff in the bar it's always the absolute worst service somehow.  I left after sitting for 10 minutes without being acknowledged. What a shame."}
{"text":"This place has great food and a great price the service is also a plus as well . It was my first time here my waitress was a great help I will defiantly be returning"}
{"text":"This place is really nice. The food's delicious. The staff are friendly. The happy hour's decent. I love the fact that they offer light selections on their menu. Their chicken marsala's delicious. The bruschetta is great as well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food, large portions and a great happy hour.  Perfect place to dine in the fall on the outside patio."}
{"text":"Something magical didn't happen this time or I was not in the right mood for Italian food. We usually go to the one in Town Square but this time it was faster to go to this one. 
Food was OK but lacked flavor. Mine was too salty and wife's plate was a little under-seasoned. Kid's portions are gigantic. Not that I mind taking stuff to go but I could split one portion for both of them. 

I think I'll take Brio off my \"occasion dining\" list for sometime. At least this particular location."}
{"text":"Well.... what can I say. Brio is always the safest bet for a casual lunch or dinner. There are probably better Italian restaurants in town but Brio hits this perfect spot. Whenever I have guests in town I bring them here. 

This time was no different. I've called 15 minutes in advance to make sure we get seated and in fact we were seated right away upon arrival.

Chilly weather calls for a bowl of hot soup and Brio's lobster bisque was an excellent starter. Carpacchio as usual, Burger (perfectly medium-rare), Crab cakes and Fritatta for me... all with a glass of Chianti.

We were in and out literally in 30 minutes. Service was timely and attentive. Brio really feels like a well-oiled restaurant machine :)"}
{"text":"I went to Brio for the first time last night after receiving many recommendations from my family and friends.  They were right!  This place has a very nice dining room and bar.  The food was excellent as well.  My wife and I went during happy hour, and we ordered all kinds of appetizers and martinis.  I didn't find any food that I did not like.  The spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer was the standout dish in my opinion. 

We had exellent service and we look forward to going back to this restaurant to try more new dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the bar last night 4-22-16 at a table . It was not real busy but our waitress made this one of the worst experience s ever at Brio and we love Brio.  Her name was Megan , she didn't seem to have her head in the game ,but could find plenty of time to talk to coworkers at the bar.  It won't affect our dining at Brio in the future.  But we'll make sure Megan doesn't wait on us."}
{"text":"I thought this restaurant was decent, it's like an Italian cheesecake factory.  The waiters and hostesses are overly fake friendly, and the italian food is very americanized - big portions, overseasoned, lots of sauce, meat and pasta.

I ordered the caesar salad and eggplant parmesan, the salad was typical, the eggplant parmesan was pretty good, the pasta that accompanied the eggplant was horrible - drenched in oil, undercooked, and lukewarm...yuck!  

At the end the waiter brought out a dessert tray with mini espresso cups filled with a variety of sweets, it is a really good idea, and the perfect size to go with lunch, I picked the apple bread pudding, but it was way too sweet, not so much..."}
{"text":"I go to Brio often for happy hour. The food is always delicious but recently the service has been something to mention. A new server named Nikki took care of us and was so great that we ask for her by name when we go. You guys made a great choice when hiring her. Hope to see you all again soon."}
{"text":"My stars are only for our server and the food quality. 

HORRIBLE Wait Time & Front Desk Staff: I called on our way to the restaurant to ask the wait time for 2 people. They said it would be about 30-40 minutes. They offered to take my call as \"call ahead.\" I was under the impression that I would be added to the list and if my name got to the top and I still wasn't there, they'd still keep me on the list until I arrived. Anyways, we get there and I tell them I did a call ahead. They check my name, but said it would be another 30 minutes. From the time I called to when I arrived, about 20 minutes have passed. Since it was our first time trying the place, we ignored the additional wait time and just walked around San Tan Village. We were told that they would text us when our table was ready. We walked around San Tan for 40 minutes and still didn't get a text. We go back to the restaurant and notice there's less people standing around waiting for a table. The hostess tells us it will be another 30 minutes because they were waiting for larger parties to leave. Again, they said they would text us when our table was ready. At that point, we were beyond frustrated with the front desk staff. We decided to stand outside and talked about whether we should wait. The long wait time didn't bother us. We've waited 2 hours for only 2 people at popular restaurants in the past. We were frustrated because we were given false impressions. We wouldn't have minded if they had just told us from the beginning that it would be 1 hour - 1 hour and 30 minutes wait. The fact is that they misrepresented the wait time. About 10 minutes later (not 30 minutes), a hostess verbally calls out my name inside the restaurant, but I didn't hear because I was standing outside. She didn't even think to call outside or text us, like they said they would. As a guests was leaving, one of the hostesses recognized me and beckoned me because my table was ready. 

Ambience: Walking through the restaurant, things seemed a bit cramp. I would prefer more distance between tables. The ambience was higher than casual, but less than classy. It was definitely more intimate and romantic. 

When we finally sat down, the experience improved.

Service: Our server was great. I forgot to get her name, but she was polite and very patient. She never rushed us. She helped us in selecting our meal. She was very quick to refill our water and knew when to check up on us. We never felt like she ignored us at one point, like other restaurants. 

Food: The food was amazing. I'm not sure how they make their food, but I barely tasted any preservatives in it. I could enjoy each taste/spice the chef added with every bite. The quality was definitely higher than anything from The Cheesecake Factory or other competitors. My boyfriend and I usually share an entree, since entrees are usually served in large portions and I can never finish them on my own. Brio has the right portion size: not to little, but not too much. I had just enough to feel content, but not bloated. 

Price: It's definitely pricey for a dinner for two. They do have a course set meal, but we decided to do just one appetizer and two entrees. The bill was more than what we usually pay at other restaurants (since we usually order one entree), but I personally felt like the quality of the food and our waiter's service outweighed the price. 

Overall, I am impressed with the restaurant and may return for only special occassions, due to the price. However, I will definitely make a reservation next time, rather than dealing with that mess with the front desk and ridiculous wait time."}
{"text":"Excellent place for some great Italian food. Service was top notch and the food was spectacular. It was a great way to top off a great Saturday."}
{"text":"Yet another date tonight... but this time I'm with 4, or should I say 5. Some good friends are in town and invited us to a nice dinner. I started with calamari which I always enjoy. For dinner I had a Caesar salad and mushroom ravioli. I will say there was nothing here I loved!! But I did however think it was cute that the waiter insisted on my free salad that btw dude, came with my meal anyways.. finishing the meal off with red velvet cake, yummm!! Would defiantly eat here again. Not sure I would bring a date though.. actually I'm not coming back. :)"}
{"text":"The wife and I went here for our 33rd anniversary dinner and had a very good meal. She had a Flirtini, chopped salad and salmon. She said all were excellent. I had a Caesar salad which was good but nothing special - same as most everywhere but then what could they do different? I also had artichoke crusted beef medallions with marsala sauce. Very very good. I usually like Charlestons for steak but this is much better and less $. 

The BAD part of the dinner was dessert. We ordered a large slice of chocolate cake that was bad enough that we should have complained.... it was bland to start with the the thing that ruined it was that it tasted like freezer. I know that most places buy their desserts but they shouldn't be frozen...!! 

We will go again but skip dessert."}
{"text":"Freshly made pasta sooo good. Lobster bique is soo good everything on the menu is delicious"}
{"text":"Alright, so a few disclaimers before I begin: I was with a big group, so give the server a little grace- and I don't like paying $20/dish to begin with. Now that that's out of the way...
I ordered a lobster and shrimp pasta dish but I'm not exactly sure which one. It literally had four tiny shrimp and one small piece of lobster. On top of that, I had asked for no mushrooms and they were there in excess. I know, I should have sent it back and not wait til now to complain about it, but shortly after we got our foor our server(s) came around with a block of parmesean to sprinkle on the food of those who wanted it. My friend and I flagged one down and she said she \"didn't want to walk around the table\" to put it on ours, so she grabbed an empty bread plate and scraped a mound onto it and handed it to me; I decided not to ask her for anything else.
In summation, Brio is just overpriced for what you get- service and all."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Brio last night for Christmas Eve dinner.  Shared the calamari appetizer and it was very tasty, lightly coated in flour and fried, served with a marinara sauce and a cream sauce. We tried the Shrimp Verduta, Crab Cakes, and Veal Milanese, there were no complaints about food or portions at our table! The chocolate cake and vanilla gelato was a perfect ending, not too sweet, and enough for us to share.  Service was excellent, our waitress Jatae was pleasant and helpful.  Cocktails were generous and priced right.  Thanks Brio, we will return!"}
{"text":"The bar is the place to be.  Love the atmosphere and Ken is an awesome bartender. Excellent food and great happy Hour.  Love this place"}
{"text":"Ate here for a big family meal last night thinking it was the best compromise option. It turned out to be much better than Zefferini, our fancy fine dining option the evening before which also happened to be Italian good. 

Granted, Zefferini was interested in providing a more authentic Italian cuisine while Brio clearly catered to an un discerning American audience, but who cares! Why?

Part of our positive experience was the waitress we had, which is always appreciated in any establishment. Given the description above you would think she wouldn't know the wine list, right? Wrong. Not only did she had qualitative descriptions about their Tuscan Chiantis, but when she brought out samples of their by the glass range (another plus), her suggestion was spot on! (Winning Chianti selection was San Fabiano)

Her recommendation for a non-meat plate (Mediterranean penne?) was also a great choice. And the fresh sourdough bread made Zefferinis paltry store bought sliced broad baguette weep. 

And always a huge warm smile. 

One last point: we were in the back room which was intimate and quiet, though I could imagine the main salon would be quiet extremely noisy. 

In sum, if you're looking for good food off the strip and aren't trying to crap shoot fine dining without a star, give Brio a try."}
{"text":"I had heard from several people the food here was good.  As I travel to Italy often I'm fairly picky about Italian food but am willing to make allowances for Italian-American restaurants.

I had the lobster bisque which wasn't terrible but not great either.  A little too peppery and some pieces of what seemed to be dried fish.  I had ordered what I thought was the crab/shrimp cake appetizer but was brought the meal.  Since I hadn't actually looked at that part of the menu I didn't realize it wasn't the appetizer until I got the bill.  The crab/shrimp cake was adequate but there was too much filler for my taste.  The grilled potatoes and vegetables that came with the crab/shrimp cake were not warm.  Completely over-priced.

The service was glacially slow.

I will not return."}
{"text":"Speedy and professional service. I like the healthier menus. Quinoa Asparagus with Grilled Chicken was my fave."}
{"text":"I'm new to this yelp contraption but bear with me. My husband and I had to stop by the Apple Store and decided to grab dinner. Went in on a Thursday and had no trouble being seated promptly. Hostesses were kind and seemed eager to help us. I had the chicken Milanese and my husband had some sort of seafood pasta, I cannot remember. Absolutely no complaints. My chicken was moist and tender. Pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce balanced it out perfectly. Looking forward to returning and trying more items off the menu! 
And sidenote: they have an adorable outside seating area and a few tvs by the bar to watch the game!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for lunch.  I ordered the Brio chopped salad with salmon as an add on.

The combination of ingredients with the red wine vinaigrette dressing is not only delicious but healthy and satisfying. Adding the fresh, delicious sourdough bread equals a completely enjoyable meal. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I have been to Brio a dozen times or more and I think each time, my experience lacks  more and more.  At dinner tonight, my salad was dripping with dressing and the calamari had some horrific sauce glopped all over it.  What's the point of frying calamari if then you drown it in some sauce that is incredibly heavy and masks any taste of the squid.  On top of that, the service was less than average.  Other than a nice place to dine al fresco, I don't have any interest in returning."}
{"text":"Excellent service, AWESOME food, AMAZING Marian and Chef Gustavo! Very impressed with the hospitality and great food. 

My children loved this place. I would definitely come here again and highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Best food and service ever. Perfect way to celebrate any special occasion."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my entire experience at Brio. I ordered a butternut squash risotto. It came out cold with a skin of coagulated dairy floating on the surface. The service was just as bad and the dining room was noisy. The music being blasted throughout the building was muffled and sounded like some college kids were having a party upstairs. A conversation about what a terrible experience you're having is nearly impossible over the drone of the music. Which might be the point of the music in the first place."}
{"text":"Went there last night with my family. WORST..I mean worst service ever. Our server was DREW. He literally ruined our night. Not returning!!"}
{"text":"??????happy hour???
???????????????????????
???????????????????4?6???beef carpaccio????????brio burger??????????????????????????Black  pepper shrimp??????????????????
2????????40??????
???happyhour??????????????????????"}
{"text":"Was celebrating a bachelorette party we Waited fifteen minutes before flagging down a waiter then waited another 5 before finally greated. Ordered food and cocktails. Food came out before drinks did. Water went empty entire time. By far worst service we have ever had. Server said manager was going to come over manager never came. We were offered free desert but informed server we needed to get going because we were going to a show  took server 5 minutes to drop of. Tab. Immediately put money/cards in and took ten minutes for her to come and pick up tab. Will not be back and will not recommend food was very salty. Manager never showed up. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Cross Macaroni Grill food with the Cheesecake Factory ambiance and you have Brio.  Went on a Friday night at 8:00 and about 10 of the 60 plus tables were occupied.  Bad sign.  Service was spotty...about on par with an Appleby's (no disrespect to Appleby's). If there were any specials or specialties, we weren't told about 'em.  Lobster bisque was below average...too thick.  Caesar salad was good.  Roasted lamb chops were terrible for $29.  Asked for medium rare, came out medium.  Also gamey.  Shrimp and lobster fettuccini was flavorful...I'd give it a 6.5.  Great location but will not return.  Too many better choices close by in the price range."}
{"text":"It seems like it has been too long since we last enjoyed Happy hour at Brio!! 
We finally made it back and were surprised  that we got the same awesome waitress. Danielle always seems to go above and beyond for us. She honestly makes us feel like family and even remembered my special martini I like....
This place is seriously the best for Happy Hour! The food, the price and the service are always fantastic!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Happy Hour until 6pm. Try the Black Pepper Shrimp with romano crusted eggplant."}
{"text":"Love the upscale feeling...and the outdoor seating for great people watching. Great after work happy hour spot, with happy hour specials on appetizers and drinks. Food tastes very fresh and homemade."}
{"text":"So we eat at Brio at least once a week.  Food is great, servers know us, and it is generally a great experience.

However, every time we go we order the Pasta Yandolino.  It is no longer on the menu but they ALWAYS make it.  EXCEPT our last visit when the \"chef just didn't feel like making it...\"  Not out of ingredients, not we just can no longer offer it since it is not on the menu, etc.  The waiter, who is very cool, said the chef was just being moody and said he didn't want to offer it anymore or \"didn't feel like making it today\"

WRONG ANSWER buddy...I'm sure it means nothing cause the place does have great food and is always busy but you just don't do that to your regular customers.  Food is a 5, Chef is a 0!!!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic Thursday happy hour this place has! Delicious $2.95 appetizers, $5.00 martinis and great atmosphere. Though happy hour is limited to the bar area and outdoor couches, Brian the manager was kind enough to let us enjoy happy hour at the tables on the patio since the place was so packed. I wish I could remember the name of our server because she was excellent! The bartenders, Alan and Ashley make excellent drinks and always have a smile on their faces. Living in Vegas I've gotten used to the ubiquitous bratty restaurant managers, servers and bartenders who act like you owe them something - they should take a lesson from the staff at Brio Tivoli Village - they are amazing and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous experience today for lunch.  This is a great place to eat if you have food allergies or sensitivities. Not only do they offer several options that are gluten free, but they were also quite flexible about making some variations for my friend who has many food limitations. The manager Steve was very personable and came to our table to be sure my friend's needs were well taken care of.  My Pesto Chicken & Quinoa Salad was excellent as well. To top it off, it is conveniently located near the parking structure and the prices are reasonable. I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Here last night with friends. We had to wait a little longer to be seated than I would have liked but we were a party of five so I understand. Once we were seated service was quick and pleasant. We shared a couple of the flatbreads to start, so by the time we ordered entrees I was already pretty full and went with a salad, the strawberry balsamic, which was delicious and just made me feel all ready for summer. We were there quite a while talking and enjoying our meal, and the staff never made us feel hurried although it was a pretty busy night. We tipped well enough that I don't feel bad about taking up space for that long, that's something I always make sure to do in that situation."}
{"text":"Brio is one of my favorite places to come for grilled salmon -- it's not overdone, over-accented, and is served in a nice portion.  The complimentary table breads are all very good and come in a unique variety.  The decor, while consistent with the other Brio locations, is sweet and festive.  It's clean, and the servers are always very kind and prompt.

One year, my family came to Brio for Easter brunch, and every course was spot-on.  I have to remember to go to Brio for brunch more often."}
{"text":"Two of us tried Brio on a Thursday night at 6 PM.  It wasn't crowded, except in the bar where the happy hour crowd was enjoying themselves.  The rest of the place was only about 70% full so we got a table immediately, and it was pleasant and not noisy.

My wife ordered the Bistecca side salad for $3.95 which she said had a great dressing.  She enjoyed it.  The sour dough bread and flat bread was good too.  Our main courses were Angel Hair Pasta Primavera for $14.50, and I had the Daily Fish Special, $18.95, which was three large Sea Scallops with a salad of greens and mixed fresh veggies with  a balsamic vinegar dressing.  I loved the Scallops and salad.  My wife liked her pasta dish too.

The desert selections offered were small bowls with different fillings.  We enjoyed the Key Lime pie filling, for $2.45.  

Our server was nice, efficient, with just the right amount of attention to our needs without being a bother.

The parking is in a multi-level parking garage that is right next to Brio.  It wasn't a hassle to park, but it wasn't very crowded so we parked on the first level.  There is valet parking for $6.

Overall we really enjoyed ourselves.  And we think most people would like Brio.  Our total bill was $56.73, before tip.  This included one glass of wine at $7.95, and one beer for $4.75."}
{"text":"Not worth the trip.  Quality has gone way down.  My steak was barely warm.  Mashed potatoes and veggies weren't anything special.  Lobster ravioli tasted like the Buitoni from the grocery store.  Lobster & shrimp pasta dish was mediocre at best.  The atmosphere is beautiful, and service was great.  Food was not up to par for the prices they charge.  Go to Grimaldi's or La Stalla in Chandler, and you will be much happier with your meal.  We swore the last time we ate at Brio we would not return.  Now we will never return."}
{"text":"First of all I'm giving this review 5 stars because of the server, Michael. If you go to Brio request Michael and you will have an amazing dining experience. He is a pro at what he does and doesn't miss a beat. He was impeccable. When I am in town visiting family this is the go to place where I know that I can get a consistently good meal. Add Michael and it is excellent!"}
{"text":"DO NOT BOOK PRIVATE DINING ROOM HERE!! Called 6-7 times to book. Was told \" we are too busy, sorry call back!\" And instantly hung up on 4 times. The fifth time I told them I called 4 times and need to know if a date is available and please put me down for it. The girl said sure! She took my name and said date was available and Mike would call me back. Never received a call, so I called back. Mike was too busy to take my call so he again would \" call me back\". He finally called back and said the date was already booked and no where written down was my date. Terrible service, rude customer service attendants and poor management!!! We will NOT be going here again!"}
{"text":"Just had lunch at Brio and it was a wonderful experience from the food to the service. I went with a friend who had the steak salad and raved about it. I being the vegetarian did not have a lot to choose from however, was able to add asparagus and avocado to the chopped salad and loved it. 

Even better was our server Ashley, she made our lunch extra special. She was friendly and knowledgable, professional and attentive. I would hire her in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Hit up the happy hour 3-6:30! Come early because the happy hour is only in the bar area and outside couches. Anthony and Jeremy were our servers and they were both great. I suggest you have a martini because the mojitos and sangrias aren't very strong, though they are both tasty. Get the burgers if you're hungry, they are big enough for a meal."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!!!!....... so attentive kind and delicious.... service was impeccable and I had a surprise birthday dinner planned for my mommy n law...these two ladies who were serving us handled our party of 19! Beyond well I was so impressed!!  Amazing ambiance! And so organized and clean!! We all were satisfied and will definitely visit again!!"}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch here today.  The food was really tasty and they had some nice, healthier options instead of all really heavy stuff with huge portions.  I had a 5 oz filet with some yummy vegetables in a balsamic sauce.  My 3 1/2 year old liked it, too, it was kid friendly.  The service was good and the staff was friendly.  We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was good. Drinks were delicious! I'll def. Be back."}
{"text":"We hadn't been back to Brio for almost a year so were worried that it might not have the same pizazz it had before. However, we had an excellent lunch (my wife had a flatbread and I crab cakes with some delicious veggies). The only disappointment was the free tiramisu birthday dessert that wasn't much more than heavy whipped cream with a touch of coffee taste. Service was not particularly attentive."}
{"text":"The Risotto & Bistecca Insalata was a 5 star dish! Roasted chicken, sweet potato, pancetta, & pine nut risotto was very flavorful! Others tried the chicken & avocado club, lobster bisque, mushroom soup & a pesto pasta. Everyone was happy with their meal. We had good service, nice environment & it was a good choice for lunch."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in north Scottsdale! Get there early to beat the crowd. Amazing cuisine and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing Happy Hour!  They have really good food during their happy hour. (aka: Tuscan Taster Bar Menu)..and the portions are enough to fill you up.  It gets a little busy on Thursday with their Martini special, but is always a fun time.  Happy hour is only available in the bar area, so get there early to claim your seat!  I highly recommend the cheeseburger and fries (and it's only $2.95!)."}
{"text":"A fairly recent family visit to Brio was relaxing for brunch. We were seated quickly as we had a reservation. The prices for brunch were reasonable,  the servings were huge, and the drinks delicious. Our waitress, Brooke, made our visit enjoyable with her knowledge, smile and comfortable ease of conversation, and her recommendations were perfect. The french toast was sweet, as she had said it would be, so we were happy that we had chosen that item to share with an Eggs Benedict dish with an absolutely smooth hollandaise sauce. The others inhaled some of their meal and took the rest home, but I can not remember what they ordered--only that they were good! We did not feel rushed by the staff, and left Brio feeling very content!"}
{"text":"One our favorite places to eat. Easter Sunday we had shrimp and grits, omelette...I think Italian....Service is always top notch.  Food was not that good and portions were small, very small.  Getting a cookie on the way out the door changes this from a 2 to 3 Star Rating..."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a local business owner. I love good food and definitely a decent happy hour. So, I tried the place while out shopping at San Tan one night; not sure that was such a good idea.

Atmosphere (3): This place was reminiscent of Olive Garden but, not as dim. The bar area was quite spacious and open (I didn't feel crowded like at other restaurant bars...too many stools scrunched together to make a buck).
 
Service (5): Hands down the service was five star. The servers were very informative with helping me to find something to satisfy my picky palate. The happy hour options were decent; $5 glasses of wine (hello somebody! A few glasses of Pinot Noir never hurt).

Food (1): This is where I has HUGE issues. I ordered a greek salad and a Margherita flatbread. Perfect combo right? No!

My salad came out and I was rather disappointed that my \"Greek\" salad didn't have and kalamata olives. Who puts regular sliced olives in a greek salad? I've NEVER! The dressing was decent but, I was totally thrown off with the olives. It didn't taste right. 

Note: Regular sliced black olives are not acceptable in a Greek salad. EVER! But, to each his own. Some may find it feasible; not I. 

My flatbread....I think they are pre-made in a sense that they add toppings to a pre-cooked flatbread and place them back in the oven. When it came out it was rather cold. It was obvious that the base (flatbread, sauce and cheese) was pre-made. I was expecting it to be hot with at LEAST warm melted cheese. Yeah, no. I sent it back and the second one came back the same way with the exception that the top layer of cheese was SLIGHTLY warmer. Bottomline, the bottom layer of cheese was unfit for anyone. Flatbread...Pizza...its all the same (IMHO). It has a crust, sauce and cheese. Everything should be hot and the cheese melted. No bueno. 

I think the ONLY thing that was pleasing to me was the two glasses of Pinot I had. Some may find it great. It just wasn't for me."}
{"text":"This place is great! I had the pasta alla vodka it's was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and most everything is great. I was not a fan of the chopped salad though and won't have it again. It looked like it had started to oxidize and was a little wilted. My friend had the wedge and I tasted the Ceasar dressing which I understand is home made, that Rocked! I also loved the service. Nice guys and attentive without rushing you. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is great, but the service needs attention. The waitress (am I allowed to use that term since it's gender-specific?) was very friendly. Unfortunately after she took the order, she returned much later to ask if we would like dessert. I guess what happens between the initial order and the time they are ready to clear the table for the next party does not matter much. The guy who actually delivers the lunch was ill-prepared to serve us because the table was covered with dirty dishes from the appetizer round. Hello? Clear the table and then bring the meal. Got busboys? Use them. It also never pays to respond to the typical question, \"Is there anything else you need?\" because you never get what you need. A simple request for red pepper flakes, which should be within reach of every table in an Italian restaurant, was completely ignored. I guess he had other things to do such as deliver water to each new customer regardless whether the water is requested or not. (I thought there was a water shortage in this town. Never mind....) Considering the location (Tivoli Village, the \"Rodeo Drive\" of Summerlin) the service was at best cordial, but hectic. Maybe adding more staff during the Christmas season, as many offices are having their office parties these days, would be helpful. I am sure we will be back, as I say for the great food, but dear friends, bring your own red pepper flakes if you like your food spicy."}
{"text":"Consistently a satisfactory experience and, an awesome happy hour! Brio has become a \"go to\" destination. Although it's a chain franchise, I always feel like I get personal service.
 
 Our group of four (two couples) just had an awesome happy hour experience, after meeting up after many months, The drinks were perfect (even with \"house liquor\"), the food was hot and well prepared, the service was spot on, and even above and beyond.

 If you have been recently let down by other places, give Brio a try, for a refreshing change."}
{"text":"Was very and really busy. Good food for a good price. Service was a bit slow, but had a good time. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Eggplant pomodoro was soooooo KILLIN'! Service was nice and attentive, no wait for a table, and there wasn't an unhappy diner at our table."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch while in town.  Great atmosphere which made for a relaxing lunch after doing some shopping.  

I had the steak salad and it was great.  My friend ordered the salmon salad and was equally pleased.  

Our server was friendly and attentive.  It's a bit pricey, but they quality lived up to the price."}
{"text":"R u serious, this place is buffet quality Italian Food.   Yes, I've been there several times for events/parties and it feels like a running joke.  Baddddddddd food at a great location.

It isn't a waste of your food time, but its definitely 50 minutes of your life that you will never get back."}
{"text":"Hosted my 50th Birthday party in the chefs banquet room. There was quite a bit of miscommunication between me and Maria. The tables were not set up to my liking and the service was slow and not very thorough. Actually,  we were lacking food servers. They did a great job rearranging the tables,  however, the manpower used for my party was inadequate  It took about 45 minutes to get the beverages to all the guests and the courses had to much delay between them. Keep in mind I only had 15 adults. When we finally did get the food it was excellent. Based on this experience I would dine there with a small group of people,  but hosting a party is not there strong suit. Additionally,  I never met the Banquet Manager or the Assistant Banquet Manager. Did not get a sense that they cared if my party was a success or not, I got the feeling they were only interested in my money. I do NOT recommend this place for a banquet or party. They are way to disorganized to host a great party."}
{"text":"I guess two stars says \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" and that's exactly how I feel about this place. 
Pros: familiar chain restaurant that can be back-up plan in a new town, large food portions, descent happy hour, consistent service, good place for gift cards?
Cons: food is bland, definitely  inconsistent the 3 times I have been there!

I remember the first time we went there was the first month they had opened and for some reason, I recalled the food being amazing! I was excited for a new great italian restaurant, however, the next time I visited the quality of food had gone down dramatically! I went there again, for a birthday, hoping that the food would be as good as the first time and I was definitely disappointed!

I also tried the Brio in Tucson, Cleveland, Colorado, and I think it's a better  place than cheesecake factory, but not as good a maggiano's.... butt if you are in a new town for a meeting, you can trust that you will get mediocre food from a reputable place."}
{"text":"Sonia our server was very pleasant and attentive. The Bread-boy asked if we wanted more bread to which we responded affirmatively. However, he never returned. I would suggest not promoting him to server until he gets the bread right. The place is noisy so don't expect a nice quiet dinner for two. Mom said the crabcakes were lukewarm at best. With so many waiters and cooks bumping into each other, why would food come out of the kitchen cold? Go figure. We'll return, but we won't be in a big hurry. Las Vegas has many choices, and at Town Square, many are within walking distance."}
{"text":"I just have to write this review because usually I have the worst experience at Brio due to the servers. But today Aaron really impressed me, he was on top of the refills and had the best attitude. I'm so glad he was our server today and to top it off the food was delicious no doubt!"}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour! Appetizers are ok!"}
{"text":"We used to dine here often but the last couple of times have been awful! We went there for lunch on a Sunday -they were pretty busy but the wait wasn't too bad. Everything was going alright until our meals came. I ordered the pasta ala vodka which was completely cold but that was nothing compared to what my husband received. He ordered the lemon chicken and when he cut into it, it was COMPLETELY raw! We flagged down the waitress immediately and she didn't even seem concerned with it, she just said \"ok I'll get you another one.\" She treated it as though we were complaining about the portion size of our food, not the fact that it was raw! It took over half an hour for my husband's plate to come out. I had already finished my meal so we didn't even get to eat together. Now, we are never the type of customers who complain and try to get things for free but I told my husband that they better not charge him for his entree being that if he would have taken a single bite out of that, he would have become terribly sick! She brings out the check and nothing. She had the nerve to charge us for the raw chicken. We asked to speak to a manager and she said \"well can I just offer you a dessert instead?\" Absolutely not! You can't make up for a $16 dish with a $5 dessert but we simply said no thank you. She walked away then came back a second later and said \"she would just take care of it and to have a nice day.\" We were baffled by this because in no way were we trying to get our whole bill take care of but we had been there long enough so we just left her a $20 and walked out. My husband thinks that there is a chance that the waitress pegged us as \"dine and ditchers\" but regardless, we will never be returning to Brio."}
{"text":"Love this place. We eat here here 3-5 times a month. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They even took the time to talk to us about our special dietary needs and really fixed us up! Top notch from the food to the service to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 enjoyed an excellent lunch at Brio today. I asked for asparagus instead of mashed potatoes with the Chicken Limon and didn't get any grief from the pleasant waitress or the kitchen. The only aggravation was the hostess absolutely was not friendly. We were the first customers of the morning (10:50 am) and she acted like we asked for the moon because we wanted to sit outside in the sun."}
{"text":"We wanted to like this place but sadly could not.  Although customer service was good, the food was not.  I had the Pesto Pasta, which was more soup like.  I was later told that the pesto sauce is made with chicken broth.  My husband had the carbonara, which was bland, like bacon bits boiled in a cream sauce. Needless to say, we will not be back.  The place was the \"Applebees\" of italian cuisine."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in on a Tuesday night after shopping (choice of convenience) and I was completely underwhelmed. The service was slow and somewhat lackadaisical not understandable for a Tuesday night at 530. The food was ok but way overpriced for the quality. We tried to like it; we shared wine a starter and our two mains. It just didn't stack up. Not worth the 70 bucks we spent."}
{"text":"Brios is a delectable Italian restaurant that recently opened at Santan Village. Located inside a structure made to resemble a Tuscan country villa from both the inside and outside, Brio's offers a variety of fine Italian cusine. 

  I came to Brio's for the Happy Hour and was very impressed with the appetizers. Each was only $2.99, making this one of the better if not the best happy hours I have been to. I tried the mini burgers, the steak bruchetta and the margerita flatbread . All three items were delicious and I can't wait to come back here for more."}
{"text":"My husband and I always pass Brio and talk about going there one day for dinner. Tonight we finally had dinner here and we were happy with everything!! Customer service and the food was awesome, the atmosphere was a plus!! We'll will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was super clean, server was nice and the tomato bisque was amazinggg
I usually HATE anything tomato so it was like an OMG HALLELUJAH moment when I had that first spoonful
It actually tasted like lasagna which made me want to cry with joy :')
The hostess was a little rude, but I'm just going to assume she had a bad day and leave it at that."}
{"text":"WOW, they sat us on time and  the food was very fresh, cooked perfectly  and tasted great and the decor made us feel like we were in Tuscany. 
My wife and I called them Saturday around noon and made a reservation for 7:45 as we were taking some friends out for their birthday. we showed up at 7:15 to try their wine before hand. When we got there they were telling people that there was over an hour wait. However, they sat us right on time.  The wine selection was limited however, everything we tasted was excellent. The two slight negatives for us personally are that they serve Pepsi instead of Coke and I don't like Pepsi and because it was so busy, it was rather noisy which made it hard to carrying a conversation. I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE and cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"We ordered the bruchetta sampler and I had the rack of lamb. Both were beyond amazing. The flavors are intense and DEFINITELY worth the price. A bit pricey, but the price was justified by the wonderful food. Best food i've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Alfredo sauce was awesome, they use parmigiano reggiano!
I had them make me a custom pasta, rigatoni with alfredo and crumbled sausage.
My girlfriend and I shared a single entree which was huge for both of us and cost.......$12!
Cheaper than any entree there!
Service was good, she took a while to get our initial drink order. But after that she was great. Hooked us up on some free alfredo bread dipping sauce and a cheap entree, so she got a good tip!

i will go back and hopefully it will be just as awesome."}
{"text":"Brio is great for lunch, dinner or happy hour. Prices are comparable to other similar restaurants and they have a decent variety of entrees to choose from. Their flat bread is my favorite,  along with the wedge salad."}
{"text":"I've been to Brio several times (all lunch) and it's a decent spot.  Through architectural trickery, somehow all the restaurants at the Scottsdale Quarter are made to appear very small from the outside yet lo and behold are cavernous upon entry!

I had the Mediterranean Chicken Salad (my diet attempt for upcoming Hawaii trip) and it was ok.  Unexciting.  I've also had the flatbreads here and I believe pasta once....but it's just not memorable.

Service has always been good, and the lunch specials very reasonable.  The best bread item (seasoned crisps) were stale this time--no bueno.

I can't get excited about Brio, it's food, and faux Tuscan architecture but I can't really knock it.  Oh, and the bathroom really smelled like a bathroom--not cleansers but um...urine.  Seal that travertine folks!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to Brio, already lovers of the chain restaurant (townsquare our favorite pick), thinking it would be the same great experience. In the beginning we were told 30-40 minute wait and since it's Homecoming weekend in Vegas, we understood and the lady manager took my name and handed me a pager. We sat RIGHT OUTSIDE and waited not long after were pleasantly surprised that another woman manager with a bun came up to us with a flatbread to take a piece while we waited. We were so grateful that she not only offered us a snack, but thanked us for waiting. Patronage is a huge thing in local restaurants and being thanked for waiting is a rare commodity.

Well an hour passes and we finally get up And walk inside. We ask how much longer to be told they were paging us for 15 mins?? Apparently they gave us a broken pager that was fully lot and functional. Thanks to the First Lady manager. We're surprised at this considering there were 4 hostesses and 2 managers, not one of them would've walked outside to call our name? 

At that point they handed my boyfriend a new charger and expected us to wait more. At that point I walked over to the bar and say down. THANK THE SERVING GODS for Kelly at the bar because she made up for my irritated and highly agitated night. 2 stars is for her and her ONLY. No more Tivoli Village Brio for us."}
{"text":"Always an enjoyable dining experience at the Brio.  Not surprised by the 30 minute wait on a saturday night.  Pork chop was juicy and nicely seasoned.  Even picked up the bone to finish it off.  Small tiramisu cup to finish off dinner...perfect size."}
{"text":"My first review - I'm rating this 5 stars due to the exceptional service provided. We originally were seated with 5 people, and they were able to add 3 (total of 8) when friends happened to join us. Additionally, our server and the restaurant manager still ensured that the timeliness of our food was still a top priority. They did everything to make sure we were satisfied and made us feel very welcomed!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, waited forty-five min for entrées then cold, they remade everything but much too slowly.
Big parties are priority from what we observed. 
Ruined my family's dinning experience!
Thanks."}
{"text":"It was a very good time. The food was delicious (had the grilled mahi mahi and my buddy had the grilled salmon), service was excellent, and helpful servers.  I would stay away from the fried calamari.  It was really greasy and more batter than meat. The design to the restaurant was pretty neat."}
{"text":"Had gone past this place many times while visiting Town Square.  Finally decided to do lunch one day.  The food and staff is excellent.  From the time you enter and see the hostess to the top manager who is Will.  He visits every table while you're eating and chats to ensure everything is OK.  Not many managers do this.  The servers are the best.  They're very attentive to all your needs.  They also have a lot of items on the menu to choose from.  Since this is an Italian restaurant I wasn't disappointed when I ordered the Tiramisu.  Rich and creamy."}
{"text":"Made plans to meet a friend/colleague for a long-overdue lunch. She suggested we meet at Town Square and Brio is one of her favorite haunts. I was panic-stricken as the last time I dined there, healthy fare options seemed scarce.  Was pleasantly surprised to find a phenomenal lunch special -- fish of the day. This day it was mahi mahi with spinach and other veggies. No need to do my \"no rice/no potato\" special order drama.  I asked for sauce on the side, no oil  and some lemon wedges.  Delicious! I even resisted the bread basket. My friend's steak salad looked fabulous and hearty as well."}
{"text":"Great and Gorgeous my girl and I are having a delicious lunch in Tuscany paradise good is so good!!! And service is excellent the chipotle panini is amazing and my girl loved the low cal salmon plate perfect for couples brunch/dinner"}
{"text":"We threw our wedding rehearsal dinner here in April of 2009.!  Wow.  The most courteous wait staff and management we have ever witnessed in Vegas.  We had about 35 people at our dinner and we had some last minute additions as well and the staff scrambled to get everything set for the extra people.  The private dining menu prices are very reasonable and for great food.   The steak was amazing.  Thank you Brio for great service and great food.  We live in the Chicago suburbs and have hosted a friend's baby shower at the Brio in Lombard and have had great experiences there as well."}
{"text":"My first time Brio. Based on review from fellow yelpers I decided to take my wife and try out the happy hour menu.

We loved everything we ordered and the service was great. I will definitely be back to Brio next time I'm in Town Square."}
{"text":"Why doesn't yelp allow half stars.  This is really a 3.5 restaurant.  Typical higher end Italian chain.  Food was ok but not exciting.  Was I expecting any thing different? Service was good."}
{"text":"As a first timer I was impressed with this place! The location is perfect in Town Square. It's a great place for family/friends dinner or even date nights. It had a very soothing and settling environment.

The dishes were slightly large but enough to be finished. They also do half servings, which comes in handy for children or anyone with a small appetite like myself. I got the Lobster and Crab Ravioli and it made my taste buds jump! Their pastas taste how they look - YUMS.

In addition to my satisfying experience, the customer service there is also a two thumbs up. They're on top of customer's requests."}
{"text":"Food was a solid 7.99/10, but service was pretty mediocre, dude with a beard served us.  One refill.  Food arrived separately, food that arrived late, we had to remind him twice to bring us the fresh grated Parmesan.  Eh, maybe worth it on another night."}
{"text":"Four of us was here for dinner on a Saturday, around 8:30pm, the restaurant was quite busy but didn't wait long to be seated, and the food was pretty decent. 

However, we had some very bad service from our waitress. First, she forgot one of our lemonade orders, she never even bothered to come to check on us after the food was placed, not even once, which gave us no chance to ask for the missing lemonade; after we had done eating for about 15mins, she still didn't show up, maybe for a dessert menu? No, not at all. We had to ask a passing by waiter to get our check, and of course when the check was delivered, she showed up... We've heard good things about this place, that's why we tried it.. But the bad service just did not prove anything. Although the food was decent, there are just so many more better Italian restaurants in the valley that we could be treated so much better, and better food."}
{"text":"This place was a big disappointment! I'll keep it short & simple. Server was slow as molasses and not into her job. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad ..easy enough , right? Nope...yellow lettuce, chicken tasted gross and barely any dressing . Manager asked if I wanted a new one...uhhh no! If you can screw up a salad then you got probs! Service slow..food not up to par. Waste of time & money .  I've been to another Brio in Cali ...guess I'll stick with that one because that one is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Day Special. After receiving numerous e-mails advertising the Valentines Day Special dinner we decided to try it. BIG MISTAKE. Reservations at 5:15 pm. We stood for an hour at the reception desk (little seating and no bar seats available) along with many others waiting for a table. At 6 pm they were just seating the 5 pm reservations. We bailed out and went to another restaurant. Either they overbook or can't get the orders out quick enough to allow early diners to complete their meal. Very disappointing. We wont be back."}
{"text":"Three of us dined. I had a whole roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies was excellent. Of course, I could not eat a whole thing. My son really enjoyed ravioli w/ tasty sauce. My wife had crab cakes which was good. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Do I go back again? Yes, definitely."}
{"text":"Long story short- I ordered my lamb chop medium rare but it  turned out to be a bit too 'sashimi-like'  for me and they devotedly have it redone for me to medium regardless the buried night. Maybe cos I wasn't expecting much, that was A+ service!
The meat was very tender and the dessert trio was impressive. I think it would have even been better if they could be easy on the salt and sugar.  
Overall I was satisfied with the dining experience."}
{"text":"Great service and food.  Busy Friday night so was a bit noisy for intimate dinner with the one I love.."}
{"text":"Hard to find real Italian food in Arizona.  Let's face it everyone can claim it, but hard to match NY style Italian.  Brio, being a chain itself, rises above the other chains and offers some higher quality Italian cooking.

My wife always gets the whole roasted chicken which *is* really good.  It's some of the best restaurant chicken I've had.

I'm partial to trying something different each time I come here, sticking with some pasta dish (heck I can get a steak somehwere else).  The ala Vodka dishes are great and anything with prosciutto is tasty.

This is a great place for small-ish date night group of friends.  Service is always good for us, selection is consistent with specials when you want them and the quality of the food has been excellent for me each time.

Tip: check out the happy hour times to save some cash :-)"}
{"text":"Mmm. Brio.

I am so addicted to their Crab and Shrimp Crab Cakes, it's ridiculous. Personally, I like to get the appetizer size (two GIGANTIC crab cakes) and then add my own side of asparagus - which they do just right there. 

If I really want to go crazy, I'll get the Spinach Artichoke Dip that comes served with their Cheese Crisp Flatbread as an appetizer. 

And if I really, really want to go crazy - I will add a Bellini to all that action. 

Brio has never let me down. It's got a great location, right smack in the middle of Town Square. If the weather is nice, have a seat out on the patio for some great people watching. 

I have taken my parents here - I've been on a date here - I've been on a Girl's Night Out here - it's just a CROWD PLEASER. Every dish is delicious and the service is always on point.

I hear they are opening over at Tivoli Village come Spring 2011. A Summerlin location would be fab for those of us who have to make the trek out to Town Square to get there otherwise."}
{"text":"All around great experience. Everyone enjoyed their meal, the service was great and the atmosphere was gorgeous.  

*****Tip sign up for their email club and they send you an offer for a free bruchetta quatro appetizer*****"}
{"text":"I've been to Brio for both dinner and happy hour, and enjoyed both experiences.  The happy hour tasting menu has a bunch of items for just $2.95!  We had the burger, margharita flatbread, shrimp and eggplant and the steak bruschetta....all were really good and decent sized portions.  But make sure to get there early to snag a table, it is first come, first serve seating in the bar area and only goes until 6 pm!

The only thing that I have had a Brio so far that I would not suggest is the lobster bisque.  I absolutely adore lobster bisque, but this version was so thick...you almost had to chew it!  Other than the bisque, the food has been perfect, seafood risotto, Gorgonzola lamb chops....all excellent.  And if you still have room for dessert...you must try the caramel creme brulee....it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Brio is a Italian Grille in a shopping center catering to tourists on the strip. The food is average, but takeout from any chain fast food is just about as good. 

We started with Roasted Garlic, Spinach and Artichoke dip. It was warm but not hot when served. By the time we all had some it cooled to a strange consistency. Chopped salad was good. Veggies were fresh and the portion was good size. The Campanelle Carbonara was presented in a soupy white sauce that was very thin and tasteless. The thin Alfredo sauce was the consistency of a white wine sauce. When asked the server explained that was normal. The pasta was cooked properly but was not fresh. Clearly prepackaged dried pasta. The special for the night was a Chicken and Vegetable Spaghettini this too was served lukewarm. Surprising to have that happen considering the place was half full. No big tables or crowds. 

Basically just an average place with very average food."}
{"text":"Brio has an excellent menu and wonderful atmosphere.  Ideal for date night or any celebratory dinner.  They also have a fabulous happy hour."}
{"text":"Pricey, but you would expect that going into a fine dining restaurant.  Came here on a double date with some of our friends from out of town.  I forgot what cut of meat my husband ordered but we both agreed that it was one of the most tender steaks we have had.  May come back once in a while but probably wouldn't be a regular here because of the prices. Nice clean and welcoming environment.  Probably good for bigger groups looking for a nice place for a special dinner."}
{"text":"I rate this place three stars, the service was average, nothing exceptional to remember. Me and my friends were sat down in a booth and the waiter took ages to arrive, but we could understand since there was a rather large crowd. We put in our order and our food came quickly, extremely fast to be honest and we sat there amazed that they did it in a short time span. Other than that we just sat amongst ourselves and ate our meals, I had ordered the chicken Marsala and it was alright, a little bit overpriced in my opinion. Other than that it was an average experience"}
{"text":"Brio is a step above your typical chain Italian restaurants. The atmosphere at the location in Town Village is great. The food is fresh and hot and the wine list extensive. Top off your day of shopping in Town Village by going to Brio."}
{"text":"My husband and I finally made it to Brio across from Kierland last Saturday night. We usually do not stray too far from the Central corridor and RARELY to Scottsdale but this place was worth it. The place is beautiful inside and busy so I recommend a reservation. We ordered a bottle of Malbec (tasty and only $27.00). My husband ordered the lobster bisque...1 word for that ....mmmmm...and I don't think that's even a word. I ordered a chop salad which was more than enough to share....we followed up by splitting the lasagna. This was where it really got good because they split for us which to me is always a plus and kudo's to the person that can eat a whole piece. The pasta was light and fresh and it was covered with 1/2 alfredo and 1/2 red sauce. Maybe not traditional but was REALLY good. I wish I could have had desert but there was just NO room. All of the other food looked really good as well....and...before I forget the service was great. We were served by Saira who knew her stuff....she was friendly, out going with a great personality and helped answer all of our questions plus threw out her favorites. Next time I am going for HH to try that menu because $2.95 appetizers ALWAYS works for me but if there is no seat at the bar than I would be just as happy in the dining room and I would definetly ask for Saira. P.S....this place won't break your wallet."}
{"text":"The food was actually very good!  However, it took us forever to get our food, and it was definitely on the pricey side."}
{"text":"This location is 10x times better than Town Square. Plus we had an amazing waitress. Good job and keep it up!"}
{"text":"Visited Brio for the first time last night to celebrate a couple of birthdays with my girlfriends. I had, had data for dinner the previous night so I thought I would do something different and decided to order the Filetto Di Manzo Toscano and I have to say I was the steak I have ever had! I'm not a big steak eater maybe crab it once a year but for this on I might ale an exception an go back multiple times a year. Just delicious!"}
{"text":"We had a wedding rehearsal dinner in a private room at BRIO. The staff was amazing there. Novo (events manager) was so nice over the phone, assisted in making this an easy booking, and making sure we had a great dinner. Our server was great. He was on top of drink orders, making sure the food was correct and placed in front of the right person. He was never intrusive when coming in to check on us, somehow made us feel taken care of but never bothered. Truly a great experience and would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Brio is great.  As crowded as Town Square restaurants can be, the wait is always quick at Brio.  Their menu has some seriously delicious selections, and the pricing is great for the quality of the restaurant.  One of my favorite things on the menu is the shrimp and eggplant appetizer... spicy, crispy... its as good as it gets.  I've had everything from pizza to pasta and fish and chicken here and its all been great.  The daily special menu usually has a fish dish on it which have always been great.  And if you stick around for after dinner, the creme brulee here is awesome, as is their coffee.  The brunch menu is also amazing... try the sausage florentine crepes... i'm getting hungry writing this.  Go there... you'll see."}
{"text":"I rate this place a 3 all because of the sever she was extremely nice and well spoken.
The food was meh nothing special. I had the grilled chicken breast with mushrooms and mashed potatoes.  I had the peach sangria which was superb."}
{"text":"Amazing wait staff and great food.
Atmosphere of this bistro can't be easily beat.
I chose the Brunch Burger which was perfect medium rare!
Gluten free pasta available was also a plus.
Great place for brunch and plenty of room, no crowded tables."}
{"text":"I've been to Brio Several times now for a sit down dinner and many more times for togo orders.
- I get the salmon Caesar salad - not on the menu but they always complie to my request on a Caesar salad with Salmon (they could add a  lemon wedge to that salad without having to ask each time).  Dressing on the salad isn't enough sometimes have to ask for extra , but delicious - only once was my salmon not cooked thoroughly (hey it happens, no biggie I'm not going to think that the restaurant is out to get me and did it purposely- and based off of that one incident give them a negative review as I see so often on yelp for many restaurants out there) but every other time which is more than 7 times now since I've had the salad has been consistent, not chewy has slight charred/grilled taste (love)  and not over done either. 

- Kids always share a kids menu item Pizza -can feed both your kids, nice size to share with two small kiddos, kids enjoy the frozen lemonade and a smoothie.

-hubby gets a few different dishes each time, mostly pasta with some form of chicken. He says he likes it, and its enough for leftovers as well.

-The two times we've had desserts were great, nothing extraordinary. My kids love the ice cream lava cake?- I'm not a huge sweet tooth person so my dessert review maybe skewed.... maybe will need to try each dessert to get a better impression.

- No experience with wine so can't comment there

I've given 4 stars because I'm a fan of the food and the atmosphere and will continue to be a patron of Brio,  Service has always been pleasant, but there has been a couple of times where the waiter forget to refill the water or only stopped by only once during our meals and that was to deliver the check, but still room for improvement and nothing negative to say. 

Beautiful décor and ambience, people complain about the price, but what do you expect? I'm sure food cost isn't cheap on salmon, chicken or other seafood, Gotta cover the overhead of the building, décor, tons of staff, pay the their bills somehow.  Depending on the time, we've waited anywhere from 5 minutes - 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Came here this past Friday night with my mother, it was super busy and we were starving! The staff was extremely accommodating - especially to my mother who is very particular - thank you staff for being so patient! The manager, I believe, was seriously was of the most professional managers I have ever had the pleasure of speaking too, I was seriously beyond impressed. Food was delicious and our waitress worked very hard. This has always been one of my favorite places and I left absolutely happy and satisfied! My mother was too :)"}
{"text":"I walked into this place for happy hour one evening expecting a few reasonably prices cocktails and a couple decent appetizers. I had experienced below average service here in the past, but nothing egregious. Knowing this, I had mentally prepared myself for the culinary adventure I was about to undertake... I sat down with a friend at one of the round tables in the bar area. I noticed the same waitress who had been my waitress the other times I had entered the establishment, the very same one who had given shotty service in the past. She was very busy talking to a woman seated at the bar, they appeared to be friends (I made eye contact with her about five times as I waited). I noticed the bar tender as I sat, Making eye contact with this gentleman multiple times. I sat for about 5 minutes, my excitement disappearing by the minute. Again, I made eye contact with the bartender. He went over to the waitress who was still talking to her friend and asked \"are you going to take care of them?\" being busy, she retorted \"that's your job, my tables are all taken care of\". They are arguing loudly, so the patrons in the bar could hear every word, for about 3 minutes. My friend was so embarrassed. Finally, the waitress came over and handed us menus, asked if we wanted waters, and would be back to take our order. We left the establishment. We went across the street to Made LV, and vented to the bartender there about this treatment. He laughed and said he heard it all the time. I wrote an email to the Brio corporate office relating this experience. A couple of days later, brio called, but I missed the call. I called back and spoke to the hostess, who took a message for the manager that I had called back. I received a call from the manager the next day, who apologized and was very sweet,  but also informed me that HER manager wanted to talk to me and apologize. It's been 2 and a half weeks and am still waiting for a call. By the way, first yelp review.

{"text":"Unimpressed. My husband actually thought the lasagna bland. the risotto and chicken dish I ordered had too much salt. Service was decent though we were seated at a booth with an extremely bright light emanating from a lamp we shared with another booth, while lights were dimmer elsewhere. The folks occupying the booth sharing our light expressed annoyance as well. I proceeded to inquire from a waitress if there was anyway to adjust the lighting but she indicated there wasn't anything that could be done other than pushing down on the lampshade to block the brightness which only  spotlighted our neighbors. So my husband, noticing my discomfort, took it upon himself to fix the problem, stood up and loosened the bulb turning off the lamp. Whew, what a relief and we were thanked by fellow customers in the neighboring booth yet there was more than sufficient lighting enabling us to  read the menu and hopefully enjoy what turned out to be a boring meal. Quite disappointed and we will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"In a word: disappointing.  In two words: very disappointing.  

Food: average.  Typical BRIO (one step up from Olive Garden).
Service: bad.  Really bad.  UNFORGETTABLY bad.

When in college I worked as a waiter.  I well know how hard the job can be.  And I give food servers every \"break\" I can.  But ours was just plain BAD!  Yet, I sense, it was not entirely his fault.  He was not well trained.

I dislike Yelp reviews that drone on about every detail of one's unpleasant experience.  So I won't.  But, in summary: waiter had no knowledge of the wine list, did ask if we wanted our salads before or with entrée (we chose before) but forgot all about bringing them and, finally (without asking) cleared the table of bread, butter, and my dining companion's plate long before I was finished eating.  (He asked if I wanted my \"leftovers\" to go while I was still chewing my last mouthful!)  

I chose to dine at BRIO specifically because I love their chopped salad.  Oh, how I wish I had had the opportunity to enjoy one."}
{"text":"Service during happy hour in the bar area is just so-so. The service in the actual restaurant is excellent. Shrimp and eggplant is my favorite appetizer."}
{"text":"I love Brio! Great food ,great service, great prices in the beautiful Town Square center! During the week they have fabulous, large portioned appetizers for $2.95 or $3.95. I booked a large group and they placed us in our own private room without charging banquet prices!I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just went there tonight, it was great, chic restaurant, great service.
The Veal was really good but the dessert part was the best, had the Tiramisu, just wished the portion was a bit bigger but it was probably the best Tiramisu I've ever had.

Also, if you're planning to get the whole roasted chicken, beware, it is a WHOLE chicken but very good though."}
{"text":"Below average Italian food and miserable service on the night we were there. I was back on a second occasion with a group and had only a slightly better experience. 2 stars for a nice patio."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend to this place for his birthday. We loved it. I would recommend that if you are in Vegas to go to this place. The food was excellent and customer service was on point. Omg there dessert is to die for. Can't wait to go back. It was an amazing  experience."}
{"text":"My son and now wife held their informal wedding in the private dining room on 10/20. Everything was great.  The event coordinator got everything arranged according to their wishes.  All of the guests enjoyed their meals which were prepared and presented very nicely.  The servers did a great job, especially considering all of the mingling guests they had to take care of.  The private room was perfect for the occasion.  Thank you to all involved! Char"}
{"text":"Invited my mom there last night, found on Yelp that if you check in you have a free app.  Our server tell us that we can choose between app and bruchettas. We pick the Spicy Shrimp and eggplant and it's was delicious!!! We finished the spicy sauce with the warm bread!  We also found on Yelp some pasta with angel hair,  shrimp, caramelised onion,.. but they didn't do it anymore but the server recommend something similar and put shrimp instead of chicken  (without any up charge :) ). So we both had the Pesto pasta . It wasn't very flavoured,  we had to put some salt and pepper.. we will come back for a glass of wine and the amazing spicy shrimps and eggplant! ....and the patio is beautiful !"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It's a Italian steak house of sorts, with great eats and a classy ambiance. It's not necessarily Capitol Grill or a Chop House, not that it is trying to be, but its half the price those ever were, local and with a great menu."}
{"text":"Just had the Sunday brunch at Brio.  The crab and shrimp cakes were delicious.  Service was awesome today!  Location is beautiful.  I have eaten at the Brio at both town square and Tivoli and been very happy with both locations in as Vegas."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I had dinner at this Brio Saturday night and enjoyed great service, great food,  and delicious drinks.  The bartender was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to beat the heat and the bartender Brendan was pretty neat! The Black Pepper Shrimp is made for a Pimp. And the Brio Burger! Should I go any further?"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Was good food. Took long time. Our waitress was very out of it and smelled
Like alcohol. Kind of amusing but had we been needing to be somewhere I would have been really mad. Hopefully the managers look at these."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian restaurant with a great atmosphere located close to the airport.  This will become one of my favorite restaurants to come. to.  Relaxing, good service and after dinner, you can walk around looking at some great retail establishments."}
{"text":"We came here for happy hour and the place is superb. Our server Nikki is top notch and was very attentive. This place is lucky to have her as she is a valuable asset to their team. The food was exceptional and the price was great. The atmosphere was good and we had a great time. We will be back."}
{"text":"The originality of the dishes are platitudinous however there was some fresh and delicious qualities. The bruschetta flight was decent (every place feels the need to put bruschetta on something that has the texture of a stale pretzel but its so much better on a piece of lightly toasted bread like sourdough) and the risotto had good flavor but the shrimp inside the dish were puny. Solid wine list, good happy hour, plus good service would bring me back for a snack and a drink... I would probably skip dinner though and just patron the happy hour."}
{"text":"I am gluten free and had the most amazing pasta lunch here for my birthday. I honestly never thought I'd taste anything that delicious again after I got diagnosed as having celiac disease. I literally day dream about my last meal at Brio and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Brio is back with the great service. We had plenty of bread and drink refills before our dinner came out....5 stars!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian/Tuscan food in town.  I think it's far better than Allesia's in Mesa.  The lobster bisque is the best soup I've ever had in my life.  Not expensive, but reasonable priced based on the food quality.  Good wine menu and something for everybody.  Take the fam or make it a special night out with the wife.  This place will accommodate any occasion."}
{"text":"Haven't been out to a restaurant in forever with the fam so I thought we'd give this one a try. My bistecca salad side was the highlight of the meal for everyone. My wife ordered a lobster bisque appetizer which was flat and salty. Her Mediterranean penne pasta was bland and over cooked. My fettucine \"Alfredo\" rustica was missing the creaminess desired in an Alfredo dish. I don't think they added any cheese. My 5 year old also said that the lemonade is better at McDonalds. Overall- $50 plus for bland, over cooked pasta. Sucky. Will never return."}
{"text":"Solid food. Neither spectacular nor bad. Good service. Sit outside."}
{"text":"Authenticity is not their forte.  However, location and happy hour is.  Loved the beef carpaccio and pasta vodka with Peroni draft.  My wife loves the free sour dough and spiced flat bread - lol.  Fyi, mall employees get a nice 20% off ;)  I say 3.5, but rounding up to 4 because service has always been great."}
{"text":"I've been to Brio several times--it's been a great go-to place for us while walking the San Tan Mall. It's always been reliably good, reasonably priced, and good service. I would always have given it 4 solid stars.

BUT, last night was outstanding and they earned the 5th star. I went with 3 friends from work for happy hour, 1 of whom was grumbling about driving all the way out to the middle of nowhere (we work in Chandler, he lives in Central Phx). When we got there, the only room to stand was on the bar patio, which was wasted space. There were a couple of tables, but we could have done cartwheels in the empty areas. So, we asked if we could bring chairs out, and we borrowed a side table from another couple who had 2, and the servers bent over backwards to accommodate us. Suddenly, we had a nice, cozy corner of the patio to ourselves and we stayed for 4 hours! Don't worry, we ordered enough drinks and food to justify sitting there that long! Our server, Amy, was absolutely adorable, and she could have sat down and had drinks with us and fit right in. The little garden table was small, so Amy left us a serving tray and a stand to put our food on. Again, above and beyond.

The food was outstanding. $3 for huge appetizers?? Hello! We ordered 8! It made the fact that we were spending $10 on martinis a little more palatable. No drinks specials, but really, the food was so good we really didn't mind. The burger was HUGE, and well cooked, the flatbreads were delicious, and the bruschetta--especially the steak one--were perfect.. High quality ingredients, very well prepared. This was NOT happy hour bar food. Not a chicken wing or mozzarella stick in sight.

Amy told us that on Thursday nights, they take $2 off martinis in addition to the food specials, so we'll be going back then. And by the end of the night, the grumbler was totally won over--he couldn't say enough about how great it was, and he's a tough customer. He doesn't hand out praise easily.

We'll be back again, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Wow! Planned a wedding reception for 25 after my son's wedding last weekend. All done by phone, planning with Tiffany at Brio. She couldn't have been more effiecient and professional. Our group was put in a lovely private room with 2 servers to assist us. The food was really, really delicious! My favorite being the grilled pork chops, yum. We had the room for 2 1/2 hours and I was able to have a cake delivered and also put out favors at each table. The servers always asked us  prior to adding any charges to our bill. Very well priced. Beautiful setting at Towne Square, inside as well. Not high end but well presented and a great value and looked and tasted MUCH more than the price reflected. What a memorable evening!"}
{"text":"My family loves Brio! We eat there once a month and have never had an issue with anything. Our food is always great, servers are friendly, atmosphere great and we love the desserts! Anyone who complains about pricing needs to get out more. Food prices everywhere have gone up and for what you get at Brio it is reasonable."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, super friendly staff, but it's a chain...

Typical italian fare and a brunch menu, so we tried both.  We had the french toast which is better at IHOP or any other breakfast joint.  We also tried the lunch sandwich and salad combo. My turkey club panini was a waste...tons of bread with one slice of turkey, too much cheese, and an unchewable tomato.  The chopped salad was ordinary.

We won't be going back. Once is enough."}
{"text":"Went there for Xmas breakfast with my family. Ouch bad choice. The breakfast fare was less than exciting. Scrambled eggs,bacon,sausage,home fries, French toast sticks and muffin. Eggs were good. Bacon was greasy and undercooked. Home fries were hard and cold. French toast were dry and hard. The orange juice served in sealed cups were frozen. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to stop after a day of shopping.  The decor is a little bit over the top, but the food definitely makes up for it.  The service has always been great for me and the pasta is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is a winner.  Having just relocated from one of the best food meccas in California (SF Bay Area), I have been on a quest for good, non-chain restaurants. Every thing about this place works.  Atmosphere, location, parking, meal any time of the daytime,  excellent menu choices, great service mixed with mediocre, healthy food choices,  small dessert portions, excellent wine choices--I could go on.  In 6 weeks since moving we have been here 5 or 6 times.  I will bring friends here for sure, and I just ate dinner alone in the bar area 2 days ago, & it was perfect for me!!  All you negatives , go elsewhere. This is a fine choice!!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the service! Nice clean friendly place that my husband and I enjoy regularly."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 8 on Mother's Day for a late lunch and was seated promptly with my entire family. The service was phenomenal, our waiter was extremely attentive and kind! Ordered the Pasta Ala Vodka which was absolutely DELICIOUS. The waiter never left us without bread as he knew my two picky toddlers were only going to be eating the bread and he even gave us fresh bread to go! Ordered the dessert sampler and tiramisu which were just amazing. I am never disappointed, but this visit was really special. My 3 year old daughter even hugged the waiter before we left!!! Will absolutely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with coworkers, had grilled salmon angel hair pasta. The salmon is pretty good, but a very small portion. One of my coworker keeps saying he is hungry right after lunch :)"}
{"text":"Don't bother to come here if your looking for good tasting Italian food. The service was good, but quality of the food was poor. Appetizer we ordered was calamari. It seemed frozen and not fresh. Sauces were not good. I had the pesce piccata, it was very dry and not pleasant tasting at all. The pasta fra diavlo was terrible. It looked like mac and cheese with shrimp.  The third person had the risotto, that was just okay, definitely not good. 

Highlight was sangria and bread. 

It's sad that we wasted some decent money on some bad food."}
{"text":"alright Brio!!! You have redeemed yourself! 
Came here on a Thursday and the service was back to the expectation we had. Our server was lovely and she was well informed on all the happy hour menu! 
Thursdays are absolutely insane, so get there early to find a good spot, the server in the bar found us a spot even though there were none. Anyways my wife and I will be coming back again and am happy that we had better experience.
 Hopefully the previous cocktail server has had some  better days and shows more kindness to her guest! For us the restaurant experience is a combo of service and food."}
{"text":"To start, -1 star for repeat violations, all three violations were repeated from last visit. -2 Server chewing gum while folding dinner napkin (essentially spiting on everyone's napkin THANKS, -3 runner bringing out food when we are only half way done with our salads (I had to ask him to take the hot food back, which when it did come out it was just warm oh well, he was just going to leave it on our table where it would have turned cold by the time we got to it, c'mon man I know it's not fine dinning, but it's not Olive Garden either), -4 pantry cooks using single use food handlers gloves improperly (really scary, if you don't know how to use them correctly, they are actually worse than bare hands). I like your food, but please these are all training and management issues. The last time on our way out I passed a Manager who asked how everything was and I told him. This time no one asked, so know I'm telling everyone. PLEASE FIX THESE ISSUES WE LIKE YOUR FOOD, BUT UNLESS THESE ISSUES ARE FIXED I'LL JUST FIND SOME PLACE ELSE TO SPEND MY MONEY."}
{"text":"I was as customer on Sat, Feb 2nd, and now I am getting around to my updates.
Good food for the $$, easy access, and decent, attentive wait staff.  I read all the latest reviews on this place and might I say some of the negative ones must have just been very unlucky. One note: get there early as the closer to dinner the longer the wait."}
{"text":"I was VERY satisfied with my meal! I had the pasta primevera. Very flavorful! You can't eat here in a rush....because they take their time. Not too long, but the wait is DEFINITELY worth it! ;)"}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise! We really enjoyed the food but did let the manager know the service was sub par. Thomas absolutely made things right. No excuses! We will for sure be back!  That is the way to run a business."}
{"text":"The happy hour is unquestionably the best in the valley of the sun.  the tuscan decor is great with the carpaccio topping the appetizer list for both flavor, size and aioli sauce.  The happy hour wines are valued accordingly.  the main dishes are excellent."}
{"text":"My favorite day of the week is Sundays just because of Brunch! Brio never fails me with their delicious brunch options and Mimosa pitchers. Me & Mom come pretty much every Sunday and enjoy a nice view @ the bar. Jade is the BEST bartender and always makes us feel welcome and no matter how busy they are (& Boy do they get busy), she always give us the best service. 

I cant pick one plate to rave about because all the apps are great (especially the Bruchetta sampler) and the brunch menu has several great options, depending on what your in the mood for. 

All the staff is very attentive and the manager is always walking around checking on everyone. There is usually a wait for a table, so come prepared but its definitely worth it. 

We will keep coming back for the Yummy food, Great drinks & Jade!"}
{"text":"What a night!.. My boyfriend and I were meeting up with family for a special occasion and Brio was the spot. From the moment he approached our table, I cannot begin to describe how pleasant Matt was to us throughout the meal. Absolutely attentive, wonderfully personable, and professional. I generally don't write reviews, but I can't deny this man undeniable skill in his craft. Can't praise the night enough!"}
{"text":"Excellent Service!  Alberto made great recommendations.  Food was delicious---excellent red sauce---had calamari, tomato soup, margarita flatbread and spaghetti.  Enjoyed our experience.  Will be back and ask for Alberto!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Brio's on several occasions in the past and have always found the food and service to be very good. On our visit last week, however, I found the experience to be exceptional.  I ordered the Carbonara  and it had to be one of the best I have had.  The dish included fresh spinach and chicken, delicious.  In addition, the service provided by Ashley was excellent."}
{"text":"Happy hour rocks!  The food is incredible and the price is right! 

Beef Carpaccio - Field greens, capers, mustard aioli, Parmesan 3.95. My favorite!  

Margherita Flatbread - Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh basil 3.95

Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread - Ricotta, Mozzarella, Provolone, housemade tomato sauce 4.95

BRIO Burger* - Provolone, roasted tomato mayonnaise, housemade chips 5.95

Tomato Mozzarella Salad - Vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh Mozzarella, field greens, basil, balsamic drizzle, lemon vinaigrette 4.95

And more.  Also, The Patio is great when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is exquisite and the service impeccable. Right away, as you enter, you notice this place is well lit, clean and crisp. I dislike going into a restaurant and it is dim and dingy."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and yummy $5 martinis on Wednesdays. You can't beat their bar menu either. The beef carpaccio is good as is the shrimp dish. The white bean dip is tasty and feels healthy.  ;) The only slight hiccup in our experience was the so-so service from the bartenders. I sat at the bar for a good 5-10 minutes before being acknowledged by either one and it was only because I caught their attention. I understand they must've been busy making drinks with the $5 martini special, but one generally wants to be acknowledged. When my friend arrived one bartender did the same thing and actually approached people who arrived after she did. Overall, an ok experience, but perhaps a little work on customer service. I don't ever skimp on tip and this time was no different, although I feel like I should have said something. I still like local establishments vs chains that go the extra mile with friendly service better. :)"}
{"text":"We sat outside since the weather is getting nicer to do so in Las Vegas!!! Some friends joined up for happy hour as Brio is about the best in town. Sometimes the service at this location is questionable but this visit we had great service and, unfortunately, I cannot remember her name:(  As always, the food and drinks were great!"}
{"text":"Food is always great! Sat at the bar and had the best service and Bloody Mary with Jade the bartender! Always great time but this was above and beyond. The bruschetta sampler is awesome."}
{"text":"This is our first time trying this restaurant. The location of this place in Tivoli is beautiful. As well the interior of the restaurant. The server we got was nice and helpful. Stars for the looks but the food was even worse than Olive Garden which I'm giving 0 star. My husband and I have traveled across U.S. and even out of the country and that's how we learned how to love food. And we love love love fried calamari. The calamari we got was too much breading, tasteless and hard. The worst calamari we ever had that we could not even finish it (and I hate wasting food). And the lasagna and pasta we got were OK(i would say applebee's quality)"}
{"text":"This place is Very good ! Thank you so much to the Boss, Manager or whoever Run this place. And bIg Thank you to a NOVA the special party planner. He made our get together party very special ! I were misunderstood  on the phone conversation. But got there and he take n care of it :-) Showed me that he cares about he's job how to please the customers, and people ! Thank you very very much !

I  happy Customers ! :-) 10 stars !"}
{"text":"We have been visiting this restaurant on a pretty regular basis since it was opened. I must say that this past visit was one of the worse experiences we have had. The waitress was excellent but the food was terrible. Seems that the food preparation has suffered under new management. Steak was not prepared to our asking and vegetables were cold. We have noticed a decline in the food but an increase in price, not a good combination. Not sure if we will return or not. Our daughter loves the wedge salad and is the one that talks us into going all the time but I think we might need to make another choice and disappoint her."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. We come for happy hour -- their $2.95 Tuscan tasters are fantastic, especially the spicy shrimp and eggplant, which is probably one of my favorite restaurant foods of all time, and their sliders (hint -- dip the sliders in the sauce from the spicy shrimp and eggplant for a real treat). I also love their steaks on the regular menu. They get it right every time. 

Love the staff, too. They always remember us."}
{"text":"I was not disappointed .......... the service and food were Very Good.

                  You'll find a  Quality Meal ....... with Quality Prices.
                  From the Hostess to the Servers ........ its all Ten's. 

About the Food ...... Throughout my life ..... I've had better Italian.
This is Upscale Dinning ....... its more about the experience ...... then the Food.
Conversations with your tablemates ....... are almost impossible ..... Extremely Noisy. 

        By all means ........ Try it Once ........ Then decide for yourself about return visits. 

                       Me ......... I'll be back ....... every 2 or 3 months."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous! Food is excellent. All the waiters are hott!! LOL.. i will def be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Do not come here. We went to attempt and eat dinner at this place with a group of 6...my 2 friends and my fiancé and her friend. They are both from London and have British drivers licenses. We attempted to order 2 bottles or Prosecco and the waitress said they had to provide their passport on top of the ID or they couldn't be served..we have been for for 3 nights and have eaten out every meal and went to nice clubs and have not been asked to provide a second ID. The lady brought the manager over and she was very rude and cold. I asked to show me the law/article that shows international tourists have to provide a passport on top of their ID, and she said she didn't have it..she pulled this rule out of a rabbits hat. The waitress and manager were so rude and unfriendly and don't know how they work in the service industry..even if you don't have the same problem we had avoid coming here this is a crusty chain establishment with horrible service. Take your business elsewhere there are much nicer places in this price range."}
{"text":"The service is crisp and professional.  It is located in the hustling and bustling new Scottsdale quarter, right across the street from the parking deck.  Outdoor patio seating lets you observe and people watch.  This is our absolute favorite place for a fabulous tasty steak salad."}
{"text":"On Sept 23, 2015 We had a small wedding reception at Brios.  What an amazing experience.  They went into the room and decorated for me because I was at the wedding. It was beautiful. The food and service were top notch.  One dish stood out,  a vodka pasta plate was a big hit! 
A very special praise to Nova the director of banquets.  A very sweet, understanding and helpful young man.  He was there for me when I was breaking down and nervous about the party. He is just perfect at what he does! 
Thank you for a perfect day! 
Sandra Perreault and family"}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday the service was horrible we were given dirty utensils also the glasses weren't polished. The pasta was bland and I didn't like the chicken that was in the pasta. Better off eating at California pizza."}
{"text":"The lobster bisque was delicious!  The prices weren't to bad, two adult two children $120.00 after tip. One minor complaint, two of our sodas ran empty and I had to ask for a refill. This is a big pet peeve of mine however I'll cut them a little slack since it is Mother's Day. We will return."}
{"text":"Food and service are excellent!  My wife called me gay for my drink selections, but the flirtini is awesome too. 

The only downfall is that we were told we would have a 25 minute wait, but ended up waiting over an hour."}
{"text":"Really good restaurant. The service is good and the food is delicious. It is perhaps a bit pricy but I suppose  it is slightly a classy restaurant. I often get chicken on the brick and the marguerite pizza. Both are great. The sitting area is nice particularly the outside during the summer."}
{"text":"Stick to the pastas, everything else is poorly prepared. Dried up chicken and overpriced steaks. Prices do not reflect the food quality."}
{"text":"Best place ever! Momma and I are regulars here, and the great food coupled with exceptional service really put this place over the top. From the complimentary bread to the incredible chopped salad to the amazing pastas , steaks, chicken and seafood dishes, you will wonder if any restaurant can ever measure up. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing service all around!  Amanda the server was on point and adorable!  Even told her I like cheese, so she brought a container of extra cheese for my to go container!  Made my friend samantha 's birthday amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! They made our anniversary really special with free champaign and dessert. I would definitely recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Really, really bad service. My husband and I decided to try this place in a whim. We arrived around 8:30 on a Saturday night. There was no wait and plenty of open tables. We were asked to wait for the next available table. Meanwhile, while we were waiting 3 parties of 2 who walked in after us were promptly seated. When we were finally seated, we waited another 10 minutes with no greeting. My husband and I finally walked out without even ordering. The only time were greeted was by the manager on our way out asking how our meal was. We both have worked in the service industry and were appalled by the lack of urgency."}
{"text":"Amazing good, good service, live music and an amazing interior and setting. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch as I was in the area and had some time to kill.  I was pleasantly surprised by the ambience and the food at the Brio.  It is across the street from Kierland Commons in the Scottsdale Quarter, and kind of out of the way if you are at Kierland.  But I was visiting the Apple Store, so it was a convenient stop. 

It is very nice inside and spacious, although not very intimate.  There are several small areas set off from the main room, but the over-all affect is like a large chain restaurant. 

I was there right after the lunch rush hour, so the servers were not busy.  There were two that were taking care of my table, and they were very pleasant, and very attentive.  Their suggestions were helpful, especially as to the size of the servings and the daily specials.  I had the bruschetta sampler and the Pasta alla Vodka and both were very good. The prices were reasonable, and that, along with the service and quality of food made it a very enjoyable lunch.

The servers did tell me about their bar menu and happy hour, which sounds very interesting.  I will have to stop in next time I'm in the area - I'm always looking for good HH."}
{"text":"Great! Went during happy hour, although they were busy the food and the waiter service was fast and efficient. We had four happy hour items and 5 drinks for $40."}
{"text":"Very good chicken piccata. Portion size was right, good amount veg and cooked perfectly. Skip the Sangria - better of with beer here. Drinks not this place specialty. Bit expensive but the \"light\" menu is probably the way to go."}
{"text":"Matt was an amazing waiter on our anniversary dinner.   Shrimp and Lobster Risotto was tremendous.   Rich and plentiful - cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Went with some friends with happy hour and was disappointed. The food was not good, the only fish we enjoyed was the eggplant with shrimp. We sent everything else back unfinished, especially the beef carpaccio. 
The drinks were ok, but had very little alcohol. 
Overall I would not come back."}
{"text":"Booked a reservation for five at 4:30 p.m. on a Sunday.  Our party was there EXACTLY on time but we had to wait just under 10 minutes until the hostess figured out where to seat us...so what's the point of a reservation? Minus 1 1/2 star.

After we were seated, no one came to our table and acknowledged us for 10 more minutes. Huge customer service mistake. The waitress finally showed up but she should've had the bus person bring water and bread while she was taking our drink orders. Again Brio's management, customer service was underwhelming. Minus 1 star.

The drinks were served and our food order was taken then delivered.

1.) Shrimp Mediterranean..5 med/small shrimp on skewer. Small portion, o.k. flavor.
2.) Lasagna..the two members of our party liked the flavor, not the portion.
3.) Spaghetti in red sauce..it's spaghetti, what else can I say.
4.) Veal Milanese...basically chicken fried steak with a small side of pasta. Not worth  it for me. Flavor was nothing special. Pasta was plain.

Meal = Minus 1 1/2 star.  Flavor, portion and presentation are all lacking.

Overall = Total of 1 star given. Brio's is 100% geared towards tourist who would probably never come back so the attention and details of the staff and quality of the food is not a concern. I will also never come back or recommend Brio's to my friends. This is a customer service town with a lot of choices, first impression counts when it comes to where I spend my money."}
{"text":"Our booth still had crumbs on the seats when we sat down (we were a walk-in on a Friday night, so I can't judge too harshly). Other than that, the service and food was great.  We had the Caprese Classico, Shrimp Mediterranean, and 5 oz. Filet Brio from the Light Menu.  Delicious and guilt-free :)"}
{"text":"had a drink at the bar. fairly priced.  dinner was very good.  ate here last year when we were in town and enjoyed that visit too.  highly recommend"}
{"text":"We came here on the 4th of July for dinner..  There were not many patrons which was great!   We sat right down and had Ashley as our server.  She was excellent. We had the burrata & ciabatta ap w/ a side of balsamic (free w/ Yelp checkin), double pork chop (beyond tender and moist), Milanese (great size), and the pasta pesto.  All of our food was very good, made exactly how we ordered w/ a few changes. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Every time we visit Vegas we eat here.  Wonderful atmosphere and great food.  James was our server, who was very friendly. Our table had the lamb chops, lasagna, chicken Milanese, pasta pesto, gluten free sausage pasta, sampler dessert, cream brûlée, ricotta cheesecake, chocolate cake w/ vanilla Ice cream.   Every dish was flavorful, and well worth it for the prices. We'll definitely continue to return...."}
{"text":"A group of us went for AZ Restaurant Week. I am not sure if it was all the large graduation parties or lack of experience with the Restaurant Week menu but service was a disaster. We waited 15 min for a first drink and it only got worse from there, finally after our dinner was served before our appetizer and we refused it, a manager stepped in and things got a bit better. We really appreciated his help.
The food was really good which made it extra disappointing that things were so disorganized. Additionally on both of the plates that included vegetables, the veggies were cold. By then we had given up trying to get things right. 
We were there just under 2 hours for a very basic meal. The waiter was very apologetic once he caught up but I am not sure if I would try it again."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant it had the best Caesar salad I've ever eaten. The ambience is nice I didn't really like the valet parking it's an $8 charge to park your car in front there is a public garage directly across the driveway from the restaurant but I found it to be full and was forced to use valet parking the food and the service was good actually the service was a little too good she came back every 10 minutes to ask me if I was doing okay but all in all I would say this is a very good restaurant and I would recommend it"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Brio 3 times. All three times the wine was served HOT. Not warm, room temp. HOT. Each time the waitress acknowledged the fact and asked us if we would like a \"side of ice\". Are you kidding me!? When I asked if they receive a lot of comments on the wine, she replied \"yes, but usually ice helps\". On to the food..... average is about the best it can be rated. We have tried the restaurant 3 times just to be fair. Too many managers, servers, bartenders running around to have mediocre service and average food. Three strikes on this place..."}
{"text":"Good food, great prices of Happy hours as usual but again disappointed by the service. No smiles, no sincere services by hosts and server. What's wrong with this place?? It was much better before. It's getting worse and worse every time I go there."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant but it seems so loud. The couple times I've been here it was always crowded and reaaallllyy loud. I don't necessarily like having dinner at a place where I can't here the person next to me. The food is pretty good and price in my opinion is right. Wish that the restaurant had less of an open design so that the sounds done travel as harshly."}
{"text":"Good food and service. I got the lobster tail and shrimp. It was amazing. The spinach dip was good."}
{"text":"The food was so great..not blown away by our server! She didn't have much of a personality. :-/ Think her name was Michelle.."}
{"text":"Came for brunch today and had the best experience. Mimosas, Benedict and French toast were all amazing! Seen the manager seating a table , running food and even stopped to fill our mimosas for us :) No wonder it's a successful and busy restaurant ."}
{"text":"Took some clients to Brio based on some good reviews from friends.  Thought the food from the appetizers to desert was excellent.  The service was also spot on, i.e. not too smothering and not too spacey.  Loved the place!"}
{"text":"Was very upset. Myself and one other family  member are vegetarians. This restaurant does not cater to vegetarians at all. We both ordered a dish with chicken. We asked for the chicken to be taken off and replaced with a side of vegetables. Waitress was happy to accommodate. Manager on duty this particular night did not want to accommodate us. The manager charged us full price for the pasta dish  without the chicken. And charged us for the side of vegetables. We will not ever go back to Brio. Very disappointed in this restaurant. Shame on you, Brio of West Lake, Ohio in Crocker Park."}
{"text":"Great Ambience, Decent Service, Overpriced Fake Italian Food."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for the happy hour menu.  The happy hour menu is supper great with reasonable prices. I enjoy ordering the delicious shrimp with eggplant plate and the the biro burger."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch and when we walked in we thought it might be pretty expensive. White tablecloths, nice decor, just looks a little high end. But we were pleasantly surprised with a reasonably priced menu. Great service, some of the best we have had since moving to Gilbert 3 months ago. Husband ordered eggs Benedict, I got risotto, and sister ordered pasta. All delicious. And since it was our first time there, we were pleasantly surprised with a complimentary bruschetta sampler. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is now my favorite restaurant.  As an overview, the food is excellent, the service is professional and fast, the noise level is a bit loud when crowded (like Cheesecake Factory), the lighting is low, the prices are on the higher side, and you get seated almost immediately with reservations. We came for dinner on two occasions around 6pm both on Saturday.

The food is one of the highlights.  I recommend the 8oz filet, or the crab and shrimp cakes, or the lamb chops, and the sampler bruschetta, the Tiramisu, traditional cheesecake, and the Torta Di Cioccolata (like a fancy lava cake with Gelato).  I recommend those  since those were the only dishes my wife and I have tried so far and they were very good!  

The beef and lamb were cooked perfectly to order and seasoned just right.  The roasted veggies that came with our entrées were very good although mine were slightly over seasoned. 

The crab and shrimp cakes were awesome...  not too much breading,  not overcooked, and the quality of the seafood was great.  When I took my first bite it reminded me of San Francisco (that where I grew up).  The crispy potatoes that came with this dish was really good and so were the roasted veggies.

The bruschetta was pretty pricey but was pretty good... if you want to skip the appetizers, that's ok because the rest of the food and experience is more than enough to satisfy and leave you with a smile.

The desserts are a wonderful sweet topping to the experience here.  The cheesecake, has no graham crust but I guess that's traditional.  It was still really good.  The Tiramisu was just the way I like it.  Anyways...all of the desserts that I've listed above go well with the coffee served here.  FYI when the waiter presents you with the dessert tray, they are presented in little cups, however they do have the regular size versions of those.

The portions were the right size.  Let me put it this way,  when we left, we did not feel like we overate.

My wife and I have come here twice in the past two weeks and we love it.  The first time was on a date night and we were very happy.  The second time we came was for my dad's 70th bday.  My parent were happy and my wife and I were happy... Good times!

Hope you enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Consistently good food and perceptive service. Gluten free menu available. Even when crowded, they provide prompt take away."}
{"text":"Based on reviews and the location I wanted to check this place out. Ambiance is nice...Happy hour might be great, as the bar area was packed...But the food?  Horrible!  Let's just put it this way. I felt like like I swallowed the ocean after eating here. Everything was waaaaaaay over salted. Over seasoned as well. Even the greens salad. We ordered the sampler bruschetta, stuffed peppers as an appetizer and split the risotto with roasted chicken for our entree. The bottom-line is the flavors were just not there. I noticed they have a pizza oven, so maybe their bar food is good. But, I would highly NOT recommend this place for dinner."}
{"text":"I don't particularly like chains, but I tried it. The food is ok, but over-priced.  I have had better Italian food for this price range. I don't go here unless friends meet here for lunch."}
{"text":"Not impressed with restuarant but they're Happy Hour is amazing - that's impressive! You have to get there early though or you will find not one seat - $2-3 dollars a plate for very good Italian, no wonder it's not easy...Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food as usual at their Happy Hour. But we were really disappointed by a blond ponytail server at a bar. From the beginning to end she was looking upset and NEVER smiled. No appreciation toward us eating there.  We tried to make her laugh and my boyfriend was extra friendly to her, but he gave up. It kind of ruined our date. We always have been fun and good time so just it was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple time.  The atmosphere is nice, think Bellagio cafe and that is about what it looks like inside.  Food has always been good and it is a little expensive but not overly.  Perhaps the right level for North Scottsdale.  The only issue i have that every time i have gone i get 'JOHN PIERRE' or whatever his name is.  I'm not sure if he is still there but he looks like his name should be 'MIKE' not John Pierre and he makes me totally crazy.  Doesn't come back enough, drifts off, was very irritating.  After the first time i went I thought for sure he would be fired but i went back months later and he was STILL THERE and i got him AGAIN..."}
{"text":"I made reservations to go here for my biffle's burfday.  The hostesses were very polite and the place was busy, but still pretty quiet for the size of the seating area and high ceilings.  We were sat promptly and our waitress took our drink orders shortly afterwards.  The service was pretty good, the food was just \"okay\".  Overall I wouldn't call it a favorite, we may try it again sometime, but aside from this it was nothing very special and I feel as if it was overpriced for what I got.  Visit and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Last Wednesday was the first day of live calls at our call center, so to celebrate the executive and support staff went to Brio Tuscan Grille for a celebratory dinner.

I've never been to Town Square before...driving around in here gave me a feeling of not being in Vegas...more akin to being down on Rodeo Drive in LA (I know it's nothing like it but it's the feeling I got).  

Stepping into the building, I was impressed with the high ceilings and tall back wall that looked like it had been delivered from Rome itself.  It was very loud in the restaurant because of the openness of the space (it's very spacious for seating and the bar area) but I was able to find my group very easily and interact without much trouble.

The wine, appetizers, salads, bread and soup were all excellent.  The choice in breads was nicely done to not bore you with a simple roll.  The entree's were classic italian faire, however I ordered a steak (not in the mood for lasagna or something pasta).  It was cooked wonderfully; I wasn't the only one to order the steak...all enjoyed theirs, too.

Desserts were served in a type of large shot glass with flavors such as Creme Brulee and Tiramisu, among others.  I loved scooping into the tiramisu and finding a different flavor every scoop.

It was a little pricey for my taste; since I was part of a group and the company was footing the bill, I was more than happy to attend.  I would come here only if I wasn't paying.  If I were tasked with taking care of the check, I could find quieter, more intimate places to get the most bang for my buck."}
{"text":"I haven't changed my mind about their rating from my last visit.  It's hard to believe their generousity.  I received a free entree as a birthday gift, no strings attached.  I had no choice as it was for a particular dish (Beef Medallions with Shrimp Scampi, described on their menu as:
Three 2 oz. tournedos with marinated shrimp, served over orzo with sauteed zucchini, asparagus, grape tomatoes and fresh thyme. Topped with citrus garlic sauce and pesto bread crumbs.)  That dish happens to be $21.95! and you know what, worth every penny!!  The beef was cooked perfectly, extremely tender and exploded with taste.  The vegatable side was exotic and tasted as good as the beef and shrimp and were a perfect accompaniment.  My wife ordered the lasagna again, it was better than we remembered.  Great meal, great service, great environment and a great day for me, every birthday I consider a gift from God!  We plan to return and try the happy hour at the bar next visit."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, very pleasant and attentive service.  I had lunch.  The lobster bisque was absolutely delicious - but it would have been nice if my bowl was filled as opposed to a half portion.  The Caesar salad was nothing more than a few morsels of romaine hearts, one cruton and a a teaspoon of salad dressing.  That was a bit of a disappointment and I left hungry.  I'm sure pastas and other entrees would have been a better choice."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of good things about this restaurant and felt so disappointed with our visit. I'll start with three positive things. The bartender was friendly and efficient. The young hostess was was also happy and friendly . And, my niece was offered a free dessert for her birthday.
I wish I could say the same things about the waiters as I did about the bartender and hostess. Initially we were told we would have two waiters as our group of 9 people was a large table. Good sign right? Wrong, we rarely saw one of the waiters. The waiter forgot to get drink orders from half the table and then forgot to bring out drinks that were ordered. Before dinner bread was placed on the table. A small plate with 4 pieces of bread...for 9 people. The waiter looked confused/angry when we asked for enough bread for everyone.
Then the food arrived. The food came out at various times, one meat dish undercooked,one pasta dish very overlooked and mushy and one of the salads hardly resembled what was listed in the menu. The rest of the food was mediocre. I don't know what was happening in the kitchen that night. We were there on a Sunday night and the place was packed.
I wish I had better things to say. Like I said, we heard good things about the restaurant. Maybe they were having a very off night."}
{"text":"The service was awful. It toke 20 min for them to bring tap water to my table. Server hardly came to the table to check on us. Food is good but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time on my anniversary with my boyfriend and my opinions on this place disappoint me so much cause I tried to find the smallest reasons to love it! The service was slow and we got our food before water. Our server also threw back lots of attitude. I asked politely for fresh bread in the beginning and the server rudely goes, \"most people here like the bread hard but sure.\" The food came out and my boyfriends food was cold! And I got the spicy shrimp fettuccine, seeing the price being $20 I expected it to be great, and that being said, the shrimp was hard, pasta wasn't fully cooked, and I found probably 3 lobster. Great sauce. But couldn't be happy eating it. We got the cheesecake for dessert and at that point I was over it as well as to how mushy it was. I'd give brio a second try one day but unbelievable as to how my first time went."}
{"text":"My wife and I went out to dinner at Brios with my parents on Thusrday night and every one of us was very happy with our meals. The presentation and atmospher was equal to or better than any \"5 star\" rated restaurant in the valley. This was our thisrd time there and as usual the night out , the service and the food were supberb. It's always fun to go out to the Kierland area and this night was no exception. Great Italian/ Continental at reasonable prices. Try it you will love it!"}
{"text":"The worst bartenders I have experienced in my life. Did not even have the courtesy of saying hello or any attempt at being friendly. It was like they were deliberately trying to  make me feel uncomfortable . They also said some inappropriate comment under there breath which was out of line and disrespectful for no apparent reason. I noticed they treated those of \"color\", mexican and black very rudely as opposed to other guests. 

The food at first was okay but later I had to spend a few trips to the toilet. Enough said about that. Will not be giving these ladies my business again."}
{"text":"My family and I come to Town Square quite often and always pass Brio while we're shopping. Finally, after 2 years later, decided to go on a dinner date with my mom after a long night of mother daughter bonding (a.k.a retail therapy). 
The minute we walk in we were greeted with pleasant smiles and warm \"Hellos.\" I was expecting to wait to be seated because the shopping center was busy that night, however, I was mistaken. We were seated right away. 
The atmosphere is awesome, definitely a place I'd consider having a wedding reception at. The decor is beautiful, the lights are nice and dim, the ceilings are vaulted and it makes me feel like I'm eating in a chapel. It's very fitting to have either a romantic dinner or even a casual lunch. 
The food was delicious. The portion was perfect. It didn't leave me still hungry nor did it make me over-stuffed. Started off with bread and lavash and a lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was just a little bit salty but nothing that a piece of bread couldn't compensate for. Shared a Chicken&Quinoa Salad and Pasta Pesto and it was absolutely delicious. And for dessert I enjoyed my favorite, Creme Brulee, made perfectly. 
I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"You have to try happy hour in the bar...$2.95 for everything on the menu It's madness. I've successfully tried every food item on the happy hour menu, and it's all been amazing. The brio burger is great. The spicy shrimp and eggplant must be laced with crack, or some other addictive substance. I could eat it all day, every day. The bruschetta is amazing; everything is amazing. Happy hour is an amazing deal. Have I said amazing enough times yet? 

I've also eaten dinner here, just for a point of reference, and it was excellent as well. Service is attentive, the food is great. Try this place. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"We held our wedding reception at Brio Tuscan Grille at Town Center. It was so wonderful, I can't recommend this place enough! A few emails is all it took to book our reservation from Washington state. Nova was very helpful and would respond to my emails within a day or so. The evening went off without a hitch. When we all arrived, the room we reserved was all ready and set up beautifully. The service was excellent and the food was amazing and TONS of it! Our guests kept complimenting us on what a wonderful choice we had made for our reception and how great the food was. I highly recommend Brio for any special occasion!"}
{"text":"Good food that's consistent at a descent price. Would go to again, try the pasta Brio with extra chicken"}
{"text":"I received an invitation to Brio for a Spy on Vegas Event. It was great because of the Free Drinks and $3.00 appetizers. The food was surprisingly delicious. Since it was a SpyonVegas event there was not much seating. People were herding over the drinks and there wasn't even enough organization. Eventually we were able to get a spot on the couches. The server was helpful despite the chaotic mess of people. We ended up ordering everything on the appetizer menu. My recommendations- the spicy shrimp & eggplant platter, steak bruschetta, and Margarita pizza. For drinks, definitely have the regular or peach Sangria."}
{"text":"Came for appetizers and drinks with friends.  I recommend it for at least that much."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always consistent with the food. Love the reverse Happy Hour and the outside seating area. Great to bring family and friends."}
{"text":"Wonderful day here. The bread is awesome and the food believe in the greater heard so many good things about this if that was. Looking forward to it"}
{"text":"I'm very dissapointed because I always go and have a drink with my wife at this restaurant, and I never had problems when I showed my id to the waiter, and now I come and the waiter says she can't take my id as valid because is from other country. Im only here for bussiness and everytime I go to vegas, I go to Brio so I'm wondering what they do with all the other tourist that are in vegas? Unfortunately my wife and I will never go back to such place. This is supposed to be a tourist friendly restaurant and we felt discriminated I only hope this didn't happen only because I'm not american."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant in San Tan Mall on a Friday evening.  The service was very slow - took an hour to get our food and the waitress never bothered to check on us in between.  The pasta was overcooked and clumpy.  This is an overpriced chain, with lousy food that is equally matched by lousy service."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been to Brio several times.  Generally I split the Chicken under the Brick with my friend and we get the asparagus as the veggie and to start we split the Brio Chopped Salad.  Every time it's great.  Several of my friends have ordered the Grilled Mahi Mahi Fresca and the Grilled Salmon; they have all stated it's wonderful and that the fish seems really fresh.  Also the free bread and crackers are wonderful. We generally like to relax after and grab a coffee while we chat; the coffee is really good as well.  The staff is always friendly and seems very knowledgeable about the menu.  I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a great dinning experience.  Our bill generally ends up around $32 (not including tip) before splitting."}
{"text":"This is a great place to have a finer Italian style meal. I have been here for several occasions and find it to be relaxing. As always large portions adorn your plate. Price is moderate. Reservations are great for those busy times.

The wait staff has always been on the better side. They have consistently checked on us but not being overly annoying. Had a snafu once and they did everything to make us feel that we were in the right and quickly resolved the issue. I am critical of wait staff and it does reflect tipping.

Food here has always been a notch above other restaurants such as Olive Garden and even my other frequent haunt Carrabba's in regards the the more normal Italian dishes. So far out of all the meals I have had here they were all great. I especially enjoy the lasagna.

I do tend to recommend this place to others if they enjoy good Italian food."}
{"text":"Brio is located in the new shopping  mall , Town Square,  which is  about  2 miles south of  Mandalay Bay.  We decided to check it out after reviewing the menu.
 For drinks I ordered the special Wild Berry lemonade which was so quenching. For the entree, I ordered the Chicken and butternut squash Risotto which came with a choice of  Insalata (chopped, caesar or bistecca)  I chose caesar  which was a generous serving.  When the risotto came , I thought, \"what a big bowl with such a small portion,\" but it was actually just enough to fill me.  My husband ordered the soup of the day which was the tomato bisque which he really liked.  For his entree, he ordered the linguine with baby clams and was happy with his choice.  The waiter brought over these mini desserts that looked so irresistible, we decided to order one Tiramisu and one Panna Cotta.  It was so good!  
The staff is pretty attentive and the decor is very nice with plenty of outdoor seating.  I would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"We had a very nice dinner last Saturday night. The restaurant is a bit noisy but we were by the kitchen which is very open and visible. The service was very good and personable. The lobster bisk we had was ok, I didn't really taste any lobster. My wife's raspberry mojito was sweet but no punch. The dinner itself was very good, and they didn't overwhelm us with to much food. Then we busted the bar, and all the bar tenders were friendly. Over all this restaurant is worth the visit. Make reservations if your going on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I liked this place. Thought it seemed like an Olive Garden on steroids. Very good food, very good wait staff, very great atmosphere. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Walking in I felt like I was in Las Vegas. The tables were clean.  Service was on point and food was extremely good.  The dish sizes are beyond the normal proportion I am use to. Definitely a great place to eat


-Cheers-."}
{"text":"This bar has the best Happy Hour in Las Vegas! If you ever stop in, make sure you ask for Bri, she provides the best service possible!"}
{"text":"Went with family for dinner on Thursday. Seated right away. Not a lot of people. Next table just got their order, they sent back one, wrong item. We waited for about 10 minutes noone came. Should be a clue. Complained to hostess, a server was sent right away. She's nice. Took our order. Note that no meatball option at all (wanted for our son). Appetizer and basket of bread came within reasonable time, but the same can't be said for entrees. Server had to apologize. When they came, they looked very good. Then wife complained the breaded chicken tasted weird, as it's old frozen chicken. I tasted and agreed. Server was nowhere to be found, needed to flag hostess to send her. She let manager know and he came and took care of exchange of salmon. It was good. Finished and ready to leave. Server was MIA again. Told my wife to take son to go to Barnes and Noble, while I waited for about 10 minutes for the check. Overall, very bad experience and won't be back. Many other options in the area. Sorry."}
{"text":"Service was great he was on top of it! Which was nice because he did have multiple tables to attend. The steak my hubby ordered was mouthwatering & cooked to perfection! My salad was delicious . ..pretty tasty & filling. Our daughter had her own pepperoni pizza,ate the whole pie! She absolutely loved it! Deserts were amazing as well our favorite was the warm chocolate cake. We tried the tiramisu as well but it was ok alot of whip cream if you ask me."}
{"text":"The \"best steak salad in town\" is now the worst.  Less than an ounce of steak, bag o' greens past their prime and I counted exactly three  pecans on my plate.   At  our table, the floor crunched with crumbs under our feet.  The booth seating was sticky.  The noise level, including unnecessary shouting from the prep area,  is oppressive and I was unable to converse normally with my lunch companion.  The staff  are friendly but clearly overworked and stressed.  All in all, an unpleasant dining experience.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"We had reservations 6 last night, and, based on my experience at the Park Meadows/Colorado location, I was very excited to partake in some yummy Italian food. We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess, but that's where any semblance of good service ended. The waiter completely forgot to bring bread and butter and was very difficult to catch when we tried to ask for some. 

Our starters came quickly. Our entrees also came quickly. So quickly, in fact, that there was no room on the table for any of them, and we were left scrambling to finish our salads while the busboy wedged in main courses. 

I ordered shrimp and lobster ravioli, which I've had previously at the Colorado location. Apparently this one doesn't serve it, so the waiter changed my order to fettuccine and neglected to tell me. I did not want fettuccine. The busboy kept trying to give me the plate I hadn't ordered until, a good 5 minutes later, the waiter showed up and allowed me to order something new. By this point, I was stressed out that the rest of the party would be finished by the time that my meal came out. From what I remember, the roast chicken was good, but since I was trying to inhale it, not much made an impression.

Last but not least, my friend and I ordered the same dessert - creme brulee. My dish clearly hadn't been cleaned properly before the new brulee was made, since it had rubbery, burnt on bits at the bottom on the ramekin. That, however, paled in comparison to my friend.

She found several different kinds of paper inside her dessert - what looked like a sizeable piece of paper towel and tissue. Like the rest of the night, the waiter never came by to check in, so the issue was never resolved.

Ew."}
{"text":"Brio is an Italian Restaurant located in the middle of Town Square on the South Strip.The parking area is a short walk away. It is a large layout containing an inside and outside sit-down bar, plus numerous tables, sofas, fire-places circled by comfortable seating that offer cozy atmospheres. The kitchen is not visible to patrons and there are no emanating smells. The ventilation is efficient and keeps the air fresh. The uniformed staff is friendly and gives a warm welcome upon arrival. We are immediately seated and attended to.  Music is also performed by a small live band in the evenings. The volume is high and on the distractive side .
The dish I ordered was a beef carpaccio. It is served in a sizable platter that surprised me. It is not an immense amount of food. The center is thin and crunchy Italian bread that resembles pizza, but it is not. This is laid on top of a small salad. The outer edge of the platter has the thin slices of carpaccio that is lightly covered with mustard aioli, Parmigian and capers.
The aroma is of a strong and spicy vinegar with no notice of the raw meat. The taste of the meat is mild, but all the other condiments make the meal salty and acidic. The capers give it lively chewy taste. The texture of the meat is very tender and it melts in your mouth, while the crunchy bread is seedy and rough. The ingredients complement each other very well.
To top it off the dessert was hot chocolate cake with ice cream on top along with vanilla on the perimeter. There was also chocolate syrup and raspberry on the side.  It had a strong flavor of chocolate and vanilla combined. Hot and cold ,sweet and bitter makes a great taste.
The wait staff was friendly however to a fault, as they checked on our needs too often. Their timing was about every 5 minutes and it interrupted our dining.
The overall experience was a plus, I would repeat."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were in Cleveland for a girls weekend and were exploring Crocker Park on a Saturday afternoon. We were debating on where to eat so we stopped to look at the menu and were talked into eating there by our waiter. 

We decided to try it and we were so pleasantly surprised by the service. We felt a little bit like 'royalty' and were even given some 'special treatment'. We got the bruschetta appetizer sampler and Oh.My.Goodness.... SO GOOD!!!! It took us a good 15 minutes to eat it because we'd take a bite... Then would savor the flavor.  The next day we were still talking about how delicious they were!!! 

As far as our meal went... We all got items from the light menu and the food was okay, but I'm 100% positive if we would have gotten \"the good stuff\" it would have been great! If you are debating on what to Order... Go fatty:)... Or just order tons and tons of bruschetta and call
It a meal!!

The atmosphere was perfect, the sangria was delicious, the peach Bellini was amazing, and our waiter and manager were spot on with customer service! Thanks for a great experience...best one we had the whole weekend!!"}
{"text":"Food was good not great. Service was good but not great. Restaurant is beautiful but far too open and noisy. All in all adequate but not a memorable experience. Server did her best to make it a good dining experience. If I was to spend my time and money dining out, I would look elsewhere. Great for drinks on the patio though!!"}
{"text":"First of all, when I made reservations and asked WHERE in Scottsdale Quarter are you located, the sales staff said they did not know. When we called later that evening, we said we were on the south end of Scottsdale Quarter near such-n-such store, where are you in relation to that, the second clerk did not know. When we finally got there, all three in the front hostess station said they only know they are located in Scottsdale Quarter, Very knowledgeable staff -not. 
Secondly, the atmosphere was like a giant Olive Garden, and the food mediocre at best. My friend and I made a mental note to never return. Doesn't matter because they won't be in business very long, at least in North Scottsdale where there is a ton of competition."}
{"text":"Great food excellent service ! Came in for lunch this afternoon with my family to celebrate my sons birthday and had a great time. Our sever Nicole was very friendly and knowledgeable and helped guide us in the right direction on our food choices ,I had the pasta Brio and my son had the strawberry chicken salad both wonderful .Nicole really went the extra mile making sure we were well taking care of our drinks were always full and she had us smiling and laughing the whole time she told us about happy hour special's they offer during the week it sounds amazing. I already have plans to return this week with some co worker .Keep up the great work Brio !Thanks for making our experience memorable."}
{"text":"Great and prompt service,; the food quality and presentation is excellent! Nice atmosphere in a European like setting. prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"You have to try everything once. This place is nice but the steak could have been better. Not something I would do again. The server came off a bit rude not to my party but to another server who was just trying to help out a server who did not help us.  On top of that she only comes when another server stands by our table. They had a wedding party here and they sat us right by the room and they was uber loud it was hard to enjoy. Now when a plate cost  28-30something dollars. A relaxing quite dinner would have been nice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary and man was it delicious. We started with drinks I got the peach Bellini and he got the raspberry mojito. I must say the Bellini was ok but just ok it was really sweet and thick and kind of hard to choke down. The mojito on the other hand was freaking delicious I really recommend trying the mojito it was refreshing and had a nice fruit flavor with not to much mint. 

For the entree I got fettuccine Alfredo cuz I'm kinda picky and it is my favorite pasta dish ever!! It was so yummy! It was rich and the pasta was cooked perfect and of course I got extra cheese. It was very filling and the portion sizes were on point. 

We didn't opt for dessert because we were so full it was ridiculous but the dessert menu did sound really good and I definitely want to try one next time we go. 

The decor is really nice and the service was great we never didn't have bread which is pretty damn awesome cuz you gotta always have bread with Italian food. I highly recommend this restaurant for an intimate date night or an anniversary it was amazing and my only complaint is I wish the Bellini wasn't so sweet! A+ Brio"}

{"text":"Amazing!!! Had brunch for my moms birthday. Service was great. Our server was personable, nice, and patient considering we had 2 kids in the party. Food is always amazing, I'm never disappointed. I eat at brio all the time, love it everytime."}
{"text":"I met a friend for a bite to eat and a shopping day. I got a brunch item a poached egg with a shrimp/crab cake on the side with some potatoes. A mixed berry lemonade. This place was really nice, and the food was really good. I heard from a friend that their dinner menu is good as well, can't wait to try it next time."}
{"text":"Love this place!

Good location, great service most of the food is excellent. Try the Chicken Milanese!  Salads are fresh and the pasta is made in house and among the best in Vegas. Oh the fresh bread is piping hot out of the oven. 

Now for bad news. The lasagna is terrible. The portion is twice what any natural human being should eat the pasta is over cooked and ingredients are unbalanced - too little pasta too much cheese and sauce. 

Definitely come to Brio - seriously good. Avoid the lasagna!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food. I ordered a pasta with shrimp. It was super fresh and tasty. It wasn't heavy and I didn't feel gross after like other Italian restaurants. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful evening at Brio with some old family friends. Every one at the table loved their dish, the pasta al la vodka was incredible. Our server, Brooke, was extremely accommodating and warm-hearted. Will return."}
{"text":"Oh goodness, where to start! We had an amazing waiter, Adrian, who started with wonderful manners and suggestions. Now the food-10/10!! My mother and I shared a pasta alla vodka (best pasta I've ever had, I promise), and my brother and father had 14 oz steaks that were not only perfectly charred, juicy and medium, but the veggies and potatoes were also seasoned quite well! I am so absolutely happy to have come to this place with my family; très bonne!"}
{"text":"Great potential here with a nicely decorated interior. As you walk in you cannot help but feel like you're in for a treat. In the end you'll need to lower your expectations as this place is just a chain. The food is just okay and competes nicely with other Italian chain restaurants. I can tell you from experience this place comes nowhere close to the food I had in Tuscany. 

Fun fact - the prices are 10% higher here than there location in SoCal."}
{"text":"I love it here at Brio Tuscan Grille!

The service is wonderful. It was crowded tonight and there was a wait even though we got reservations several days beforehand. But the waiters were patient, and they managed their time wisely.

The food was delicious. I love how each table gets a nice basket of bread before the entrées. I ordered the Roasted Red Pepper Bruschetta, which is more on the light side of the menu. It was satisfying and not too overwhelming. 

The atmosphere was casual. Although the interior design of the restaurant was elegant and formal, there were several people that ranged from t-shirts and shorts to tuxedos and dresses. I do love how fancy Brio looks, though. I enjoyed looking at the architecture and the design of the restaurant. 

I knocked off one star because although the food was delicious, it wasn't a 100% wow factor. Maybe if I tried something more exotic / new off of the menu, I would give this restaurant the 5 stars it deserves. Overall, I would probably come here again."}
{"text":"Sat on patio on best day I can remember in Ohio. Blue skies, cool breeze.
Great cold beers: Blue Moon & Peroni
Eggplant fries were awesome.
Great service by female waitress, tall, blond & super friendly.
Best people watching spot in No. Ohio."}
{"text":"Is that the owners daughters?  Can't be - it's a chain. 

Food is decent and service is pretty good - but the front desk foursome acts like they're working the top restaurant in Manhattan. Unbelievably arrogant attitude. We had a reservation and it was a true favor to seat us 20 minutes late - with an unbelievably negative attitude. 

Manager stopped by for feedback - and we politely gave plenty. He was a shoulder shrugger  who seemed resigned to his lousy employees at the front podium. 

Again, decent food for the price - nothing extraordinary but not bad for a chain. Unfortunately, based on the worst welcome staff I've ever seen, and a manager that is scared of his own shadow - they'll never see us again."}
{"text":"We went here the other night with friends and were extremely impressed with not just the food but the service as well. Our server Frank went above and beyond to make this a special night for all. He was so on top of everything that the \"spell\" of enjoying our meal and company was never broken. Thank you so much for a wonderful time! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I must say finally a restaurant who understands portions. The service was amazing and funny (like comedy hour) the staff communicated well together and I loved every minute of this experience. I ordered the Salmon dish with pasta, which was to die for. I was able to finish my  entire plate and not waste it or take leftovers. Just enough to feel delightfully full. The tastes and flavors were like a symphony in my mouth. I will be going back  here again and again and again.........."}
{"text":"Brio is one of those places you can visit multiple times and every experience is a positive one. Particularly for large dining groups. Whenever family or friends come to town with a large group, or when there is a birthday dinner, we include Brio on the list of eats. 

First off, you can do call-ahead-seating. Bonus. Especially for a group of 12+, which was our case the other night. Shotgun wedding at The Little White Chapel, then down to Brio for some celebratin'! LOL. 

The prices are very reasonable if you consider the competition and what you get. Yes it's a \"chain\" but c'mon, we're on a budget, we like to drink wine (by the bottle) and there were a ton of us! Also it's not overly chained AND they only do Italian restaurants. Bonus. 

Ok so what to get: 

Lobster Bisque Soup 
Artichoke Dip 
Lobster Ravioli 
Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto 
Fettuccine Napoli 
Grilled Salmon 
Entree Salad - Steak Salad 
Add on either the Caesar, the Wedge or the Brio salad to your pasta dish...they are all great! 
Dessert - get a variety of the little servings. YUM! 

If you are coming with just a few or alone, I recommend trying the Bar during happy hour. There are some pretty good \"bar bites\" deals."}
{"text":"It's a high class Olive Garden through and through.
      Just good food, it could be great but they are consistent at least. It's pricey for not much better than OG, then again I've never been here for happy hour. I love that they have tuscan garlic chicken that olive garden used to serve, by another name. I was thrilled with their strawberry basil lemonade, I like to experiment with food and they don't disappoint with variety.
          It's probably because the location is Crocker Park but I find it odd how snooty the staff is without being particularly good at their jobs... I usually have to flag someone down for a refill or a check and when I tried to book my rehearsal dinner here in early April and I was told they didn't have the June book out so there was no way to book it 2 months out. I don't know about you but if I was guaranteed $600 in meals I'd figure out a way to record it."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time for Easter lunch with family.  I understand that it was a crowded and hectic day that may account for the lackluster food, but, still, I think the food should hold up, regardless.  One of us had the brunch item of French Toast; another had a club sandwich; I had the salmon salad.  The food overall was just mediocre.  Good enough, but we won't be back.

My salmon in the salad was quite delicious and cooked perfectly, but the bed of greens was not high quality and the tomatoes were cut into tiny, tiny little pieces -- obviously to use in all the other dishes but weird for a salad.  The grilled asparagus in the salad was withered and too tough to eat except for the very tips. I couldn't even cut the stems with my knife.  The 'shoestring' potatoes were a nice touch, but not too many of these. I chose to omit the feta cheese, so that was the extent of this salad -- good salmon, poor greens, tiny bits of tomato, tough asparagus, and good but sparse shoestring potatoes. 

Beyond the food, the place was really too loud to have a good conversation -- it was crowded, of course.  The decor was outdated.  Service was cordial but slow, but I attributed it to the busy day.  I see others have commented on slow service, so it may not have been due to the Easter Sunday crush, but I won't be coming back to find out.  Too many good restaurants in Las Vegas for me to come back here."}
{"text":"I am currently eating at Brio in Las Vegas' Town Square Mall. I am not sure if this was an off day but the service was  not good. I had to ask for items repeatedly. The food was OK but nothing to scream about. Overall,I am disappointed and will not come back. You rarely get a second time to make a first impression."}
{"text":"Wife and I had lunch for Easter Sunday.  it was good, i started with a Caesar salad it was just ok.  I have had better, and I was thinking the restaurant was ok.  but then for the main course I ordered a specialty veal Milanese with vegetables... wow ,  that was tasty.  I felt the dish was as good as they come, and I was very happy.   my wife had the salmon salad and she wasn't happy with the quality of salmon....  overall, I was very happy with my experience.  thanks brio!  you will see us again!"}
{"text":"pretty good restaurant . service average . had the chicken lemon which was very tasty. price seemed reasonable ."}
{"text":"Loved this nice, little, restaurant!  Great food!  I had the grilled chicken and veggies that were amazing!  My husband got the lasagne and said it was the best he's ever had!  We'll definitely go back!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The only reason I keep coming back here is because my friends like the food. I always get coerced to eat here. The service is consistently horrible. One star just because of the service. The food is decent. Do not try the shrimp scampi - it is an abomination. The lamb chops however are great. Our party gave the server a 28  percent tip and he did not even thank us.He just gave us a stupid smirk like he really deserved it.  What a douche bag!  I always say I would never go back here but my friends keep suckering me back. I always think that it is going to be better but guess what? It never does."}
{"text":"Brio is delicious!!!!  The food is so good, the service is great, atmosphere is very classy, beautiful Tuscan architecture and authentic Italian food makes it one of my favorites.  Get here at around 545 and you get seated right away even for large parties."}
{"text":"Brio's food is just okay. I've had heir lamb chop appetizer, and a few of their pasta dishes. The lamb wasn't the best quality but it wasn't horrible. The pastas on the other hand were so overly seasoned, greasy, and so salty that they were gross. That kind of scared me off from trying their food again. NOW! Their bar is another story. Love it. They have an absolutely gorgeous patio with canvas curtains, string lights, and comfy chairs. They have this raspberry mojito that is so delicious that I get one every time I go there. It's romantic and intimate. The staff are excellent, I have never had anything less than perfect service when i've gone there. It's a more mature crowd and probably one of my favorite places to go on a date. I would try the food again, because it is possible I just had a few bad experiences. But the ambiance, the drinks, the service, and the location is what keeps making me come back for more."}
{"text":"Brio is a great option for a medium-higher end Italian food where you can take the family. It's a bit loud but with little kids, that's fine with me. The carpaccio rivals that next door at Eddie V's and the lobster bisque soup is buttery and superb. I get the lasagna every time. Great béchamel sauce and plenty of food. Sit out front on the patio if you can, great people watching."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and the service was great.  The place was crowded and reservations are a definite must, at least for a Saturday night.  I loved the decor, on a personal note.  I haven't had Italian food this good since Staten Island."}
{"text":"Good ambience. Looks like the cheesecake factory. This place is super busy on the weekends so call ahead. Got the feel of an upscale olive garden. Not impressive but not disappointing either."}
{"text":"Well not sure what to say about this place no more...... Not sure if we come at the wrong time but the service here has got really bad ..... This has been my go to place fore years and my last 2 visit including today just made me realize it time to let this place go.....what makes me so mad is how they go about the hole thing like all you hear is sorry this sorry that like we will take care of the bill...... Like NO we didn't come here to eat and have our bill taken care of we  come here to eat the good food they used to make and leave satisfied ....But now you wait forever and then when you finally order and they bring food it's wrong..... Like what the F**** we done waited hella long and now they to remake for us to wait even longer..... Smh, heart broken this was my last visit here..... sucked that u my man had to leave without eating his meal, he was so disappointed that he didn't even want to stop anywhere else to get him the food....."}
{"text":"Best HH in Gilbert.  The food is amazing is and the service is awesome.  Shrimp and  eggplant, beef carpaccio, brio burger, chicken parm and Ca press salad all awesome!  Can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Brio has nice ambiance. Little shopping and a decent Italian lunch. Bellini's are excellent though I didn't have one today, tad cold! But perfect on a hot summers day - they're like slurpees for adults ;)

Today I ordered the Ravioli Di Bella  - portabella mushrooms in ravioli with creminis & tomatoes. Sauce could be thicker and what would make this dish 5 stars would be to add some pancetta! But that's me!"}
{"text":"Worst hostess service ever... 45 minutes waiting for table. Unacceptable!! We are planning never comeback."}
{"text":"Go to lunch Here a couple times a month with clients. We are never disappointed by either the service or the quality of the food.
I always get the lobster bisque"}
{"text":"Came for lunch. Had the soup and salad combo. Food came out fast. They weren't to busy. They have a good happy hour in the bar area. The restaurant is always clean. People are friendly. Nice patio"}
{"text":"My wife and I were completely satisfied with our two salads!  The favors were exceptional and the portions large.  We ate outside and had great service.  The breads were unique and flavorful.  We highly recommend!  We'll be back here next time we're in town.

Don't miss this exception eating experience!"}
{"text":"This is in the Town Center in the front center area.  This means hard to park.

Big place (this is Vegas) and good food.  Italian affair so think pasta.  I emptied my pasta plate with a glass of Cab.  'nuff said.

The service is FAST to keep the tables turn so if there is a wait it won't be long.  It's a good place for a high calorie satisfying meal with a reasonable cost.  Seems fitting in LV because you come here to indulge and splurge.

Mangia!"}
{"text":"Wow! What a menu! Decisions, desicions. 
I ordered the Shrimp and Scallops Fettucini and it was very wonderful. The staff was very friendly and refilled the table's sodas without having to be asked. 
The decor was beautiful with fabric running from wall to wall. I am assuming that this would be a good place to have a group gathering as it looked like in the back there was a seperate room available for these functions. 
If I am ever in the area again I will try to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service. Employees went higher and further to provide us the most pleasant evening. We will definitely return. Thank you all."}
{"text":"I am so sick after eating here today. The plates and silverware were dirty. I tried to ignore it and just eat the food. The tomatoes were brown. I asked our server if they were meant to be that color and she replied surely yes. It is now 5 hours later and I am puking my meal up and have no appetite.  My boyfriend is just as sick and we will never go back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I'm doing this but they deserve it after my latest dining experience. I went to Brio last Sunday because I needed that steak salad again. I was so disappointed this time! The salad greens were as delicious as ever. I don't know what's in that dressing but I could drink that stuff! But the steak this time. Oh, that steak. It was terrible. I've noticed the portion size of the steaks shrinking over the last few months but this was nearly half the size it used to be! And the perfect medium rare at which it's typically served was more like well well. Dry, hard, completely void of flavor. I honestly don't think I'll ever order it again. And that's sad. So very sad."}
{"text":"I took my girlfriend to brio for a nice dinner and i was impressed. We have been to a number of resturants in las vegas but this on is on my favorites list. To start the decor in this place is fantastic, great settings and lighting. The waiter was kind and knew his stuff for sure! The food was fantastic and reasonably priced. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Great food. I tried the mixed grille. I love the spicy aftertaste.
The lobster soup was very good."}
{"text":"Food was good but there was a dead moth in mine, check had items on it we didn't order and took forever for refills on drinks."}
{"text":"Was disappointed that we learned that the happy hour is only in the bar area. The food was good, although it was reminiscent of Carrabas, Macaroni Grill. Maybe they are all part of the same chain? The service was very, very good. I feel like again, as in most places were there may be tourist, the menu is over-priced. 14 for a martini, is a bit much. I bet if someone opened a place like this for locals, a little less pricey, the customers would come in droves! Just be wary of the happy hour thing....only at the bar!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed by a recent experience I had here. My husband and I very rarely get out of the house, and on our long awaited date day had planned to go to brio for the happy hour that we've heard so much about. I was looking forward to it greatly, but upon arriving the bar was completely packed, not a single chair available. We asked if we could have happy hour at one of the nearby tables and were told we had to be sitting at the bar or on one of the couches (which were also all taken). The bar area was surrounded with 10-15 unoccupied tables that would have done the job, but instead of allowing us to sit and enjoy happy hour with everyone else, our business was turned away. Extremely disappointed in how this situation was handled. Management wasn't even apologetic. Will not be returning... Waste of my time and excitement. Ended up taking our business to yard house, where they were happy to take care of us."}
{"text":"Service, ambience and food was outstanding!  We had my dad's 95th Birthday Partly with 18 people in a private \"Chef's Room\" that holds 24.  Service by Tamara and the other server's name (sorry I forgot her name) exceeded expectations by our entire family!  Host Sabrina was cheerful and very helpful.  Mgr Nova and assistant mgr Maria was great in helping me plan our event.  The appetizers was yummy and the entrees like filet mignon, tournedos and pastas warrants a return trip to the Brio at Town Square......Mahalo & Aloha!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to enjoy this restaurant because it's so conveniently close. The food is ok, but nothing spectacular. The wait staff seemed like robots.  As if they were versed in how to speak.  Something I really appreciate in a dining experience is a person with a REAL personality.  I started with the bruschetta sampler...not impressed.  It lacked in flavor and texture.  I chose the NY Strip as my entree.  It was extremely overcooked, not to my asking for medium rare.  Overall, this was an unmemorable experience. I will not return."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar last night and had an exceptional experience. The food was outstanding and the service even better. The little blonde bartender customized martinis for both my husband and I and they were amazing. We had the Shrimp and Eggplant appetizer since the bartender suggested it so highly and it was the best item i have ever tried at Brio. Finally a place in Summerlin with great service, food and drink. Truly the total package. 5 stars to Brio in Tivoli Village!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar last night at the new Brio in Summerlin. I can truly say it was an exceptional time. Great service, the little blonde bartender customized a martini for both my husband and I, and they were both delicious. Our appetizers and entrees came out in a timely manor and were both outstanding. We were very impressed with such a new restaurant going so smooth. 5 stars goes to the new Brio in Tivoli Village!"}
{"text":"I dined at brio last night with it not being my first time.  I am usually more than satisfied.  The dishes are very generous and delicious.  The service is usually top notch and professional.  However on this occasion my guest and I had to make ourselves laugh at the situation.  

The hostesses let us know there would be a short wait which was no problem.  They were polite and welcoming.  A very short time afterwards a basket of bread was dropped off.  This is the kicker.  15-20 mins later we were greeted by our server.  I know this because a party of 10 was sat after us and proceeded to receive their first course before we even had water glasses or even a simple \"I'll be right with you\".  We noticed a manager walk by us 4 times and didn't notice we hadn't even been given waters.  The busser that had given us our bread must not have brought it to the server's attention.  At this time we were taking bets on the over under on how much longer it'd be before we were greeted.  So we got out our stopwatch and started clocking it from that moment.  Just from that moment we had an elapsed 4 mins.  I unfortunately lost the bet.  I had taken the over which was another 8 mins.  The meal went smoothly from that point on.  The chicken limone was amazing and my friend's filet was also enjoyed.  

After a bottle of true grit petite Syrah, a salad course, main course, and dessert we left satisfied with our meal.  Just please work out the communication breakdowns."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while and I don't remember it being this bad.... maybe it was because it was late afternoon & after the lunch rush so the staff was more interested in chatting than their jobs .... We sat on the patio which was filled with empty, dirty tables and remained that way throughout our lunch... Our server couldn't be bothered to open the door and actually come to the table but would just stick his head out, yelling... Didn't offer boxes, ask about the food or even return quickly after asking for the check... My son hated his food and we would have ordered something else had the waiter checked back before we'd finished eating...I could maybe understand it if he was super busy but it wasn't busy at all!! Upon returning after running my credit card he made a big show of shaking each of our hands which was weird because until then he couldn't have cared less about our service or food. Maybe he hoped the show would make us forget the terrible service... It didn't! Sadly I left a 15% tip, which I never do but I don't even think that was deserved. Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I debated between 3 and 4 stars on this one...again one of those times where you wish there was the 1/2 star option on Yelp!  So, officially, I would say 3 1/2 stars.  Slightly better than OK, but not quite \"Yay, I'm a fan!\"

I have been to Vegas many times to visit family but never to the Town Square development.  I liked the overall feel of the area with many shops and restaurants, and we enjoyed walking around before dinner.   We had a reservation, but showed up a few minutes early so we had to wait.  It was actually quite chilly that night so we really noticed the door opening and closing as we waited in the restaurant foyer, I was feeling sorry for the hostesses and the tables that were seated near the door!

I had the chopped salad to start - quite tasty - and the mediterranean penne pasta, which was vegetarian but you could add chicken or shrimp.  My companions split the caesar and had shrimp scampi and the lobster and shrimp pasta.  My pasta was tasty but  a little too heavy on the olive oil.  My sister in law devoured the scampi and my brother's lobster and shrimp was also quickly disappearing so I managed to reach over and snag  a piece of lobster before it was gone - nice and tender and in a slightly spicy sauce.

The flatbread in the bread basket was DELICIOUS and the service and drinks were fine.  I would agree that the prices are a little high - more like Vegas strip pricing than Vegas mall pricing - but it was a nice experience."}
{"text":"We are a group of about 20 that goes to various bar/restaurants for happy hour.  On Monday 8/31 we were at Brio Tuscan Grille in Tivoli.  Although the restaurant was quite empty we were seated in the bar area with high bar stools and little round tables that barely sat 4 (some of our tabled had to squeeze 5).  There were only 2 servers.  One took the orders and the other delivered.  Unlike any other bar/restaurants we've gone to when it came time to get the bills we were told that we couldn't get individual bills.  We would get one bill for each table and it was up to us to figure out who owed what including each share of the tax.  After speaking to the manager, although she was very nice and smiley it still came down to; that's the way it is.  If you're a group of more than 4 don't go to Brio's happy hour."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good wine in generous glasses, always a friendly staff and the shrimp appetizer is incredible. The bread is great, too great you always want more but they say it's still baking it'll take another 15 minutes..."}
{"text":"Feb. 11, 2015 would of gave two stars however our main server helped redeem this place. Arrived around 2pm and the place is not even close to busy. Off the bat the hostess forgot to give us the menu. After we ordered the person bringing the food drops the slice of pizza and puts it back on our plate with his bare hand. Any etiquette please. The food used to be good and the service very respectful, however after today we will no longer be dining here. Pro tip happy hour starts at 3 pm however do not expect great service."}
{"text":"This is the best happy hour in town in opinion for a combination of good $5 wine and absolutely delicious appetizers under $5.   The ambiance is lovely inside and outside.  Sitting at the bar is non-threatening for females.  A choice of low tables, high tops or the bar.  Only downside is that it fills up fast !"}
{"text":"All in all it was pretty good. The spinach artichoke dip was good, but the chips that it came out with,(pita chips), had to much seasoning on it already that didn't compliment the dip, so I didn't care much bout the chips, but the bread was delicious. The bread with the dip was yum. I ordered the Fettucini Napoli. It wasn't bad, but not great. I thought there was going to be chicken in my dish, i'm sure I read it had chicken in it, but all I got was ham as the meat. Kind of pricy for what I got, but I still ate it, with some hot sauce just because I was hungry. I probably won't eat hear again unless their was going to be a good reason for it. I am sure there are better places in the Town Square area where I ate."}
{"text":"Another solid meal and overall experience at Brio. The decor is amazing. Upscale with a wide open floor plan.

Service has always been friendly and timely, although today the hostess seemed a bit put off by us coming in for dinner at 4:45pm and wanting to sit in the dining room rather than the bar area (which she had suggested but we declined).

My favorite appetizer is the beef carpaccio. A massive plate of delicious raw beef. Excellent. I have had several main dishes in my visits to Brio, and there are a couple standouts. First, is the the lasagna. Second, the carbonara. Not the absolute best I've ever had, but certainly way up there. I have had a couple dishes that were a little off the mark, such as the lobster & shrimp fettucini, but it still found its way into my belly! So how bad could it have been, right?

Anyway, I can't quite give Brio 5 stars, but it definitely hits the mark if you are looking for a semi-upscale restaurant with consistently good food and service."}
{"text":"Oh my word! I love Brio! The ambiance is gorgeous. Staff is professional [a little stiff at times though]. The food is delicious! Had pasta alla vodka and I loved it. The portions are moderate so you won't go home feeling horrible about eating out. Brio is pretty popular so expect to wait. But Town's Square is a wonderful place to wait in because there are so many tempting shops surrounding."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you would expect from a nice chain.  The food is decent, but not too creative.  The patio is a great location when the weather is decent and the drinks are just fine.  I sampled the Tuscan Stuffed Peppers, the Bruschetta and the Calamari. 
The stuffed peppers were the best with a nice mix of sausage and creamy cheese filling.  Calamari was decent, cooked properly, but not outstanding.  The bruschetta was our least favorite - the bread was very dry, without enough moisture from the toppings to soften it.  This resulted in the entire piece crumbling after the first bite.
Our service was fine."}
{"text":"Only way to make it better is if they put a band in the corner. 

Gotta try the bruschetta. we did the sampler and all were great. I would have rated the steak as the best though. just so much taste on that little piece of bread!

the rumors are true, they will make substitution to portions of the mail, though our waitress failed at the game... the game is one of surprise. It's one of my more favorite games in rating a resaurant to see how well the cook responds with the surprise. Not so good this time. 

But I'll give them another chance next time."}
{"text":"The wife and I had a GC for this place. We visited on a Saturday night about 7:30 and decided to sit at the bar for a drink and soem Apps. There were 2 other couples at the bar and the rest were open seats. I have a beer and the wife a martini. We tried to spark a little conversation with 1 of the bartenders but he was somewhat stand offish. he took our order and delivered the food. The Apps were good but there was lack of conversation/ personality. Now the GC is gone I would prob. not be back."}
{"text":"Brio used to be my favorite restaurant. Lately the quality and attention to detail have suffered tremendously! I have found a fly in my salad and then last Mother's day I found a long black hair in my eggs Benedict! not to mention chips in many of the plates and cups. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"It's been 2-3 years since we visited Brio.  I remember why (or why not).  Great location, comfy decor and atmosphere.  Unfortunately, we were there to eat.  The food isn't bad.  It just isn't good.  Just very boring.  I'm not much of a cook but I swear I could plate better Italian food.  Bland, uninspired food.  Not exactly cheap, either.  Don't think we will be rushing back although I do recall the Happy Hour being a good deal.  At the right price, bland food is not so objectionable."}
{"text":"Went to Brio in Santan Village with my Mom for lunch yesterday. She ordered the Greens Salad, no surprise there, while I had the Romero Chicken Sandwich. My food was tasty and came with homemade potato chips as a side, but overall nothing blew my mind. The staff was nice and efficient. I will probably continue to dine there, but it doesn't stand out as being one of my favorites at Santan. I'll check back in if I have a change of heart."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch mid-week and just wasn't excited with any of it.  The place was busy, but even taking that into consideration service was not very good.  Since we had waited a while to be seated, we tried to give the server our appetizer order right away, but she didn't want that.  Then, only when she came back later to take our order did she tell me the item I had ordered was out.  That felt a little like a waste of time, because now I need to read the menu again.
Since we were seated by the open kitchen, I saw our lunches come up, but our server was sitting down with the table next to us while our food waited under a heat lamp.  That probably didn't make much difference though as it was extremely unexceptional.  I tried half of the chicken club and half of the burger.  The bottom bun on the burger fell apart after a few bites - big burger sin!
The chicken club was dry and both sandwiches had components listed on the menu - balsamic onions and roasted tomato mayo, that sounded great, but were lost in the final result."}
{"text":"Our waiter was either overworked or overmatched.  Regardless of this we had to keep reminding him that we were there.

Outdoor seating was actually quite noisy.

Food was okay, but poor service demands a less than average rating.

'okay for kids' : not sure how to answer this.  I would not say 'great' for kids, I would say 'average' for kids."}
{"text":"Great food, love the environment, and service is fantastic. Try their lasagna, it's amazing. They use alfredo sauce! It's divine. We go often as a family or for business lunches. My only complaint is the wait staff is sometimes uneducated in the difference between lunch and dinner portions, happens all the time."}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here July 28 and our waitress was a blonde lady in her 50s. She was fabulous!
We shared the Brushetta and wedge salad then had
a steak dinner with a side of Brussels.Service and food is amazing!! My favourite restaurant in all of Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Excellent steak salad and tea! There was enough steak for my wife however I needed to order extra steak on the side to satisfy my appetite. With one ice tea and a martini the total without tip came to about $57. Will definitely come back again whenever I'm visiting Santan Village to try out the rest of the menu and report back."}
{"text":"burnt dry chicken, way over cooked prime ribs. Very unacceptable. Price was higher than it was worth. There was no effort put into this food. It was rushed, fast food style. burnt."}
{"text":"the food was stunningly boring, over salted, over cooked and just plain mediocre. I felt like I should have been eating at an Olive Garden in Arkansas.  the server never asked why our food was mostly untouched, and I do not plan on spending time, money or energy in this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Attended happy hour here last night. The pepper shrimp was delicious and had the Razzbertini - very refreshing. This was my second time at this location for happy hour and it was a little too empty for my likings but I won't let that affect the rating :)"}
{"text":"OMG this place never fails to amaze me and tonight was no different.  Husband had beef medallions and shrimp scampi and 3 hours later is still talking about it.  I had the penne diavolo with chicken - yowza.  Unbelievable.  Everything, from the moment you sit down in this gorgeous place until you leave feeling oh so satisfied is an incredible experience.

I've been there several times and every time has been amazing.  Happy hour is incredible - $2.95 for shrimp and eggplant which is usually $12 and the most incredible dish that I actually had a dream about it.

Go.  You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinner options

Excellent service and attentive wait staff

Had the salmon on breaded tomatoes - excellent
Would recommend getting the side salad as there is not much in the way of greens with the dinner

PAsta dishes were delicious and well presented

Attentive to the children attending with us"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale on vacation and the bellman recommended the happy hour here.  He was right!  This is a great happy hour!  $5.00 drink menu and $3.95 appetizer menu and the drinks and appetizers were good.  I got the Capri Salad and hubby got the burger with homemade chips, then we shared the Margharita Flatbread.  It was all quite good.  The flatbread could have had a bit more zip to it, it was a little bland.  Both the burger and the salad were very delicious.  The drinks were good too, although hubby's second glass of white peach sangria was very watered down.  No problem though - we told the waiter and he brought another right away.  The service was a bit slow at times, but since we were in no great rush, it was no bid deal.  Overall, a very pleasant happy hour experience."}
{"text":"On a Mommy Daughter date night & the level of service reviewed by Adeline and complimented further by Stephanie, made the experience fabulous. They well exceeded our expectations. The filet was perfectly prepared, service was quick, & the ambiance on the patio ..amazing!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is always crowded, which is strange since the food is just ok. Of you are looking for Italian, there are a lot better places to go than here."}
{"text":"Firstly, if you go during their version of happy hour, the bar menu offerings (which is a slimmed down version of their regular menu in both options and portion size) is very good and makes for an affordable dinner. 

Honestly, Brio is just fine. For an neighborhood Italian restaurant, it's pretty good. I like their pasta offerings but they do have some nice non-pasta selections and their crispy potatoes that they serve with some of their entrees are really good. I like their chopped salad and am pretty much addicted to it. It's huge even if you just get the side added to your main dish so splitting it is a good option. I like the pasta Mediterranean and I usually add chicken. It's always enough to make a lunch the next day. The thing I love is that their specials are usually good and they do have seasonal menu items (like a primavera pasta in the spring with asparagus) which are usually pretty inspiring. We eat here pretty regularly and on the rare occasion something has been wrong, they have fixed it promptly with no fuss. 

It's a nice place for a casual dinner that is good and not too expensive."}
{"text":"What can you get for $2.95?!! Appetizers at Brio!! say whaaa!! lol!

On a mission for cheap eats and drinks at town square, some friends and I decided to go to Brio Tuscan Grille since we always go to the usual spots like yardhouse. We actually arrived just in time for HAPPY HOUR (Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm) Niiiiceeeee!!! 

The staff at Brio are super friendly, so helpful. Our server was such fun too. She suggested on what top picks for appetizers and drinks to try - kudos. We ordered the...
**Beef Carpaccio -  (field greens, capers, mustard aioli, and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese).
**The Brio Burger - (bistecca burger with mozzarella and housemade chips).
**Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant - seared shrimp in a black pepper cream sauce over Romano crusted eggplant).

Yum yum yum! hunger was satisified, not overly full. 
Brio is definitely a MUST in Town Square. They have a nice outdoor seating area with misters for the vegas heat ahhh! and at night, you can sit by the fire pit to set the mood with a loved one (idk if anyone wants to do that now?! extra heat, no thanks) lol."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Service was extremely slow. We watched our food sit for 15 minutes in the window while our waitress walked by it 6 times.  Food isn't that great to begin with even worse when sitting under a heat lamp for that long."}
{"text":"I love the happy hours here. The best one is the spicy shrimp and eggplants and Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip. Not to mention their desserts the Torta Di Cioccolata. Its the warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream on top. Our servers pretty know us there very well. I would recommend this if you like happy hours."}
{"text":"We celebrated our grandmas 85th birthday at Brio, in Tivoli and everything was perfect. 
We had a large party so we had two servers, Frank & Joe and they were both extremely friendly, polite and on top of everything. 
The food was incredible.. it not only looked beautiful on the plates but everything was piping hot and full of flavor. 
Usually when we go out with large parties something goes wrong, the service lacks or food orders get messed up, food items take too long to come out, or they come out cold, or you can't get your drinks refilled fast enough, etc.. which is why I felt compelled to write this review.. everything was perfect on that night and the staff should be recognized for doing such a wonderful job on a night that meant so much to our family."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My go to place for family night, birthdays, anniversary, etc; I'd eat here any time. Hands down they have the best salad of ANY restaurant, PERIOD!  The Bistecc A Insalata, I could eat it daily.  The Sausage, Pepperoni & Ricotta Flatbread is excellent but their absolute best entree is the Lasagna Bolognese Al Forno. Both my grandparents immigrated to America from Sicily / Italy in 1921 and they would have been proud to eat here.  That dish is a decadent masterpiece.  They also have the best lemonade!  I love this place, best Italian food in the valley!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Waited 30 minutes on a Friday night, which is to be expected. Sat down on some filthy bench seats, which is not be expected. Ordered Morel Mushroom soup only to find not one morel in it. I asked the waitress, just out of curiosity and the manager came out and told me they were in the soup, which wasn't true. Next up, steak salad. I don't recommend. The lettuce mix looked old along with mushrooms. I didn't even eat it. 
All in all, this place comes off as a nice restaurant when you walk in but the service & food don't support it. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I love the lobster bisque!! It was delicious, I often think about it. I've loved everything I've ever ordered... The steak, the mahi mahi, the vegetarian ravioli, and dessert. Must. Order. Dessert! Get the sampler, the whole sampler. Yum"}
{"text":"I love this place. Perfect every time. They hit the mark on food, atmosphere, price and service.  The complimentary bread basket is fresh and served with real butter. Most recently I had the fettucini rustica (ordered it with rigatoni instead).  Lots of chicken and sundried tomatos, but not oily and heavy like the penne rustica at Olive Garden. Very attentive servers. The only criticism would be the noise level.  This was a business lunch and at times it was a bit difficult to hear one another.  Must have been all the enthusiastic \"yums\"."}
{"text":"The food was bland and barely edible.  The beef app was a joke.  It had no flavor.  Even the mustard didn't help.   The caesar salad was yellow.  Not even a shade of green in there at all.  The lobster bisque lacked flavor."}
{"text":"My wife and I were taken there by relatives who live in Las Vegas.  We ordered the Lobster Bisque, lettuce wedge and Medallions of beef ( which we shared).  Everything that we ordered was excellent. The Lobster Bisque was the best that I have ever had. I highly recommend ordering this.  Service was excellent and the gal who waited on us was very attentive.  Should we return to Las Vegas, I will be sure to return to Brio!"}
{"text":"Brio was legitimately me and my wife Leah's absolute favorite brunch for the angel hair frittata. We are so disappointed to see that it was removed from the menu... Seriously???? Can't believe it!! This dish was absolutely amazing and several of our friends and family loved it. We told everyone about it. Sad!! Sad! Sad!!

Please bring it back!!"}
{"text":"The service was great from the hostess to the server and I worked in the service industry so trust me I know what's good service and what's not. We ordered a nice Malbec from Argentina which was amazing and wedge salads to start. For the main dish I ordered The Pasta Brio which I highly recommend. The server was highly entertaining and had a good personality. The manager was really nice too when he came by. Every time I come here I get really good service. The bartenders are friendly and cool too. The bathrooms are nice and this place has an all around good vibe to it :)"}
{"text":"The roquefort crusted steak was a gourmet delight for a special night out. Brio has just the right combination of casual atmosphere and white table cloths."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have had excellent food and good service here. Their free flat bread/crackers and their beef carpaccio are amazing. For entrees their chicken limone and their chicken under a brick (marsala) are both excellent. Their whole menu is a delight and I wish I ate more pasta so I could try their carbonara, vodka and salmon dishes. Maybe some day after I run a half marathon..."}
{"text":"Everything here tastes like it came right off a Sysco truck which I'm sure it did. It's not the worst food I ever had, but it definitely not any kind of good."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best!!
If you are looking for bland food and people watching Brio is the place to go..

I've had dinner in the past... It was awful then.. So I thought I would try lunch nearly  24 months later.. 
Bad idea. 

:( the food is grossly over priced for the quality of ingredients & dished offered.  
Thumbs down!"}
{"text":"We enjoy happy hour here. The Tuscan Taster appetizers are very good. The spicy shrimp and eggplant varies from time to time in flavor and preparation ie., crispy vs oily. The burger is always a solid choice.  It would be nice for a healthy appetizer option.
You need to stick with the happy hour drinks or else your tab gets sky high quickly.
At the San Tan location, the blonde bar manager is efficient but super serious and curt.  We always leave satisfied but not thrilled."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I had a flat bred and it was so tasty! The atmosphere is what makes the place unique. It reminded me a lot of Cheesecake factory. This place is perfect for a date night or girls lunch and shopping day. Brio is the kind of restaurant that makes you feel fabulous. Can't wait to try the one in Orlando!"}
{"text":"There are so many better choices in the local area.  The food is bland and the service is slow."}
{"text":"Excellent selections. Enjoyed the Beef Medallion.  Only thing is that they should have better lighting in tables that are in the center. Hard to read menu in the dark."}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour and I must say, they have. really good selection of happy hour items. One of my favorites is the beef carpaccio. The items on their happy hour menu are also really cheap (less than $6). Keep in mind that happy hour is only at the bar inside or the sofas outside. The tables do not qualify for happy hour pricing. The service here is decent. Nothing they did really stood out. As a matter of fact, they tried to give us someone else's order. We also had to ask a few times for our check. But regardless of this, I still highly recommend this place if you are looking for a happy hour place after a long day at work with a casual and relaxing vibe."}
{"text":"What happened to this place?  Food was just ok. Ordered the Chicken Milanese (their version of Chicken Parmesan), Carbonara, and Grilled Chicken with Peppers for our entrees.  Besides the Carbonara the dishes were very dry.  Milanese was definitely over peppered. We were there on a Sunday and hardly anyone was there.  Service from \"Aaron\" was painful at best.  No interaction at all and he seemed distant throughout the meal.  Didn't offer to take our entree order till after the apps hit the table?  Really?  This used to be one of our favorites but now I wonder if we'll ever go back.

Side Note
If someone is dining in your restaurant you should cover the valet charge.  $6 for valet parking in Scottsdale Quarter on a Sunday evening.  Give me a break."}
{"text":"Was trying out this place for the first time after all I've heard about it. I came with a friend for some drinks and dMy food came cold and I was quite disappointed, I didn't wanna be a hassle and ask for it to be remade because it was already busy. The place inside is very nice though. Had higher hopes for this place, not sure if I just came on a bad day."}
{"text":"Just had the Pork Chops....only got one and it was so good, I requested a second. My cousin had the Veal Milanse and he loved it. Our server Karen was top notch too."}
{"text":"Normally, the food is decent, but this time around the sweet potato chicken risotto was flavorless and a kid size portion.  I'm not sure if it was because it was so busy that they were just pushing food out the kitchen and they didn't take the time to taste the food. On top of that they got my daughters meal wrong, which was sent back and took forever for them to make.  But the flavor was definitely sub-standard. Probably my last time eating there considering the cost.  It's not worth paying $18 for a flavorless plate and walking away hungry."}
{"text":"Happy hour review....Really good happy hour appetizers.  Great margaritas.  First-come first serve can be challenging for more than two people.  Going to try dinner menu next week.

Dinner Area/food review....3 stars which would be above average.  5 for happy hour makes this 4 stars.  Pork chops were good but I've made them better before.  vegetables were really good.  mash potatoes were really good.  service was good."}
{"text":"The spicy shrimp and eggplant is amazing, Oliva was great with my 2yr old son. She took the time to make my boy smile and laugh even though she wasn't our waiter. The manager Lucia went out of her way to stop by and ask how the wine was, never expected that but very happy she did and even left me her card. I thought it was great that she explained the dough that was given to us so that my son could play as we waited for his lovey chicken fingers. Overall it was amazing thank you Olivia and Lucia amazing ladies with great personalities!"}
{"text":"My friend and I met at Brio for happy hour at the bar area.  Our server Jennifer was so friendly and attentive to our needs.  Made menu suggestions knowing I was a vegetarian.

She engaged in conversation knowing I was pregnant and was very sweet about it.  She also sent out an unexpected delightable, a small dessert with two candles, pink and blue.  I was throw off, how sweet Jennifer was to take the time to get a dessert from the kitchen and bring it to me.  Pink ad Blue candles, because she knew the sex was a surprise to us!! 

Jennifer exceeded my expectations and make my experience memorable.  

I work for Marriott and this is exactly what try to enstill in everyone's service delivery.

Well done!  I will be back!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go. I love the setting of course and getting to sit outdoors and have a drink or food is an option. Always have great service here and GREAT food!. I either go alone or with a couple of friends. So many others things to do BEFORE and after you eat makes this location EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour today. Not sure what time it ends, but it starts at 3:30. Ordered 3 plates for a total of $17 and some change. Awesome deal! And the food was good too. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had a nice Easter brunch with my family. Town Square was a bit crowded for the holiday, but the weather was perfect to sit on the patio. Brio is kid friendly and outside on the patio is pet friendly. Lots of nice Italian options from appetizers, soups, salads and several entrees. Good service and fresh food, they also have happy hour during the week. 
Great drink options as well!

{"text":"I LOVE Brio! I was first introduced to it in Arizona and then they opened in Nevada and now California. I have been to several locations and have had the same great experience. I have gone in groups, with my hubby and alone and each time the experience and food quality was the same - very good. I have tried new things and never experienced a problem with any meal. I enjoy the bruschetta, lamb chops, ravioli, and angel hair pasta with multiple sauces. 

We recently went with a group for my hubby's birthday when we arrived into Las Vegas from California and what a treat it was. We had a great brunch and hung out for a little while before we checked in to our hotels and headed for additional birthday adventures in Vegas! 

I had the lamb chops and a tomato caprese salad-TASTY! The birthday man had the shrimp and grits and it was morningly good-he moaned through his culinary experience. Another party attendee had the caesar salad and commented on the freshness and the great dressing. The pasta Brio and the chicken sandwich rounded off the Brio experience! But wait, that dessert was to die for. The birthday chocolate a la mode cake was great, but that Peach Cobbler was to die for! We are still having dreams of it! Love it Brio!!! It was a HIT!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice environment, very classy. I've only gone for happy hour because the dinner menu is pretty pricey. The spicy eggplant and shrimp is delicious. Try it!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Amazing food. Great wine and stellar service!!! Will be back soon for sure."}
{"text":"We visited for the second time to give Brio a fair shot and it is simply overpriced for very little. I had a salmon dish where the veggies looked like they came out of a bag in the freezer aisle of a grocery store. The salmon and potatoes were good, but nothing I couldn't have made at home. My wife enjoyed her lasagna and thought it was good. We didn't order drinks, so when our bill came in at nearly $60 I almost couldn't believe it. 

I simply cannot recommend Brio when the food is simply ok or good but priced as if it is exceptional."}
{"text":"This place is a little on the pricy side compared to Macaroni grill or Caraba's, but it really is quite good. I'm particularly fond of the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. Service was really outstanding as well as the atmosphere.

Even with the higher price point, it is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch there--love the bread basket, as so few places do that anymore. Had the chicken and wild rice orzo salad. It was a huge portion and was like something I could make at home. The service was a bit slow. They gave my salad to someone else, so I had to wait. Should have comped my iced tea for the extra wait. I would go back again, but I think it is pricey for what you get. The salad is about $13--$11 would be more fair."}
{"text":"First time eating at Brio.  A girlfriend invited me to lunch, great atmosphere, great menu choices and the food was delicious!!  I tried the Brio salad and added chicken, the spices were perfect and the chicken was a good size portion and very moist!  Our server was terrific, prompt, attentive and nice, her name was Kim!  I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Called for a 6:30 reservation. The guy on the other end even asked how to spell my name and last name. Only to find out that they didn't have me on the reservation list. What a bummer. I was really looking forward to eating here. What a disappointment especially when you are eating for two."}
{"text":"Start the evening off with the hostess, who you made the phone reservation with, tell us she does not have a reservation for us.  Service was ok. Crackers were stale.  Glassware....narrow on bottom, top heavy...one went crashing to the floor.  Food is horrible.  Market fish minuscule, very lousy piece of fish served with mostly burned carrots, a couple of zucchini, a couple of broccoli pieces.  Kids pasta with shrimp barely edible. Cod...terrible piece of fish. Fettuccini alfredo...put your fork in and the whole lump of pasta comes along. Yuck.  We gave up on Brio several years ago but the kids asked to go back. Big mistake.  How bad is it when it came to dessert, we all said \"NO!\""}
{"text":"Brio has catered a few events that I have gone to in the last few years. Always fantastic food. But, I had never been in the restaurant itself before.
I came here with my  daughter for lunch. I was not hungry till the next morning.
There is lots of covered parking in the garage. Which is really nice for starters.
The restaurant itself is beautiful inside. You can eat on the patio or inside .
The hostess greeted us immediately  and gave us a wonderful booth.
I was drinking hot tea, but my daughter had a few cocktails. A Bellini which was frozen (a little different) but,she said it was good. Also a Basil gimlet, which she said was OK.
The food was really the best! I got Lobster Bisque soup which that alone was a full meal. Then I got crab cakes they came with vegetables. Wow, very tasty and more than I could eat. My daughter got a salad, and Pasta Pompadour with Eggplant.
Again way too much and she took most  of it to go.
Food was fantastic, service was very good.
Too bad it is so far away from me. But, I never mind driving. It is a win win day or night out here. Plus they play fabulous Italian music!"}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe how good this place was.Surprisingly of the 93 reviews, no one mentioned the grilled mahi mahi with farro, spinach and a tomato basil vinaigrette. The plate was light, super tasty, and addictively good. I actually wanted MORE as I finished my last bite (a rare feeling for eating out). I substituted fries for steamed veggies. I was also surprised at how \"inexpensive\" it was - $17.50 a plate is less than mahi mahi plates at places of similar caliber (i.e., McCormick's and Salt Creek). Would love to visit this place again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I come here often especially for the happy hour..best deal in town , nice atmosphere,  appetizers are my favorite not too mention the happy hour cocktails. The prices on the happy hour menu is really affordable."}
{"text":"I went last night with a group of friends,  I had a Brio Steak Salad, and it was very good. The waiter was very nice and friendly. I also have a cosmopolitan martini that I LOVE it!"}
{"text":"I was brought here for an Italian lunch.  I must say that it was fabulous.  I had the Salmon with Angel Hair Pasta.  The Salmon was cooked perfectly, the pasta was a perfect al dente.  The combination of fresh pesto and scampi sauce with a touch of red pepper flakes makes it a very memorable dish.  The staff was very kind and accommodating.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  Our waitress Caitlyn and who I assume was the manager made sure to welcome us and kept coming back to the table to make sure our drinks were freshened and that we enjoyed our meal.."}
{"text":"I am constantly surprised with how much we enjoy our time, food, drinks, and the staff at Brio.  Whereas most chains fall short in the personality department, the bar crew here is supreme.  Mandy, Kelly, Jim and all of the rest of the team know how to hustle and entertain while keeping the cocktails and delicious cuisine flowing.
We started coming here for the unbeatable $3.95 happy hour menu (3-6:30 and 9-close weekdays) , but now it has become high on our go-to list of places to feel amongst friends."}
{"text":"Beautiful location!  We have eaten once outside, and twice inside.  The service has been very nice each time.  I've had the Mezza Chicken, Eggplant Pomodoro and the grilled Salmon.  I would order each of them again, very delicious.

The calamari on the other hand was too salty for me, but others in my party enjoyed it.  The Quatro Bruschetta was disappointment.  I did have a bruschetta on the specialty menu with proscuitto and asparagus that was very tasty and I would have again.

I don't recall the names of all the drinks that I have tried; one was a martini with Absolute Raspberry, pineapple juice, and cranberry juice (missing some ingredients).  It was incredible!  The only problem was that it didn't come in a bigger glass, (careful, this one goes down quick).  The other was a strawberry lemonade with fresh strawberries, fresh basil and prosecco.  I know, fresh basil seems strange, but I'm going to try and make this one at home, I loved it so much!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch today and it was great.  Our server Sonia was amazing.  She was attentive and on top of everything.  We asked her for recommendations and we tried them and we were pleased with what we ordered.   Good food and good environment."}
{"text":"Great spot in Tivoli village...especially for happy hour.  I had cheese ravioli and it was amazing - and very cheap!  They also serve mojitos, which are one of my favorite drinks.  The scenery is usually pretty good and Tivoli village is a great cozy atmosphere.  Easy parking underneath and easy access from Summerlin Parkway make this a winner..."}
{"text":"I really like Town Square.  And Brio fits right in to the atmosphere.  A cozy restaurant that has both a dining room and a bar area.  If you arrive at happy hour, the deals at the bar are amazing.  $3.95 for 3 deep fried cheese raviolis for example.  They also serve mojitos and sangria on top of all the regular bar drinks.  For dinner, their pasta is good.  I had the lobster bisque and it was good, but I enjoyed their tomato bisque even better... but I don't think it's always available.  Overall, it's a classy place at a just above average price range.  Most dishes are $10 - $20.  I think it's a step above Olive Garden and Macaroni Grille..."}
{"text":"Yum...

Great Service, Great Food, and they took my \"special order well. 

My special order was this:
The Tuscan Chicken Salad. YUM... but it came with mushrooms and Gorgonzola, I am not a fan of either, so i substituted Feta for Gorgonzola and omitted the mushrooms.  The portion was just right, I ate about 3/4 of it and took 1/4 of it home.  So it wasn't over done.  I have nothing bad to say about this.  

this was the most fantastic salad I ever had in my life.  

The wine list was fantastic.

Definitely a must go!

Ronney"}
{"text":"Chicken Lemone was pretty nasty. Also the veggies that came with it tasted really bad. Recommended by our waiter. WOW! Glad I wasn't the one paying that day. I won't be back for a second treatment."}
{"text":"Went to San Tan Brio for Breakfast with Santa 2014, we made reservations for 8am. Highly disappointed. Poor set-up for the buffet. Buffet was against the wall, which made the line run through the middle of tables full of guests. The buffet was cold, long line for the buffet, and lack of organization to meet Santa.  Where to meet Santa was right at the entrance of the restaurant, which caused chaos. Server was extremely nice however was not advised by management that drinks are to be brought to the tables, she initially was told guest are to help themselves. After a while, we finally got it figured out, took over half an hour to get coffee. Part of the delay was the drink station was behind the long line of guests waiting for the buffet. Like I said, poor set-up. To top it off, the food was mediocre to unappealing. Example, the muffins were of something you would get from Holiday Inn. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I'm a HUGE fan of Brio but lately the SERVICE has become less and less something to rave about.  Last night, Monday 9/18, I met a friend at the bar for dinner and for the second time on a Monday night (in a matter of two months) the bar service was TERRIBLE, food service took forever and they only had one bartender.  Not only was she working the bar but also the well for the dining room.  Many of us sat waiting for food, drink refills, etc. The manager came around several times but seemed to lack the intelligence to realize his bartender was not keeping up with the demands of the customers.  I finally got up and grabbed him to request help for his bartender because apparently they didn't think it was going to be busy enough for two bartenders and called one off before Happy Hour even started.  By the time we got our appetizer (45 min later) it was cold and arrived at the same time as our salads and entrees.  This is certainly not the service we've been used to!!   It's apparent that customer service isn't important to the management at this restaurant whether it be long time or new customers.  Our choices are many for restaurants in Gilbert and I think it's time to revisit our loyalty!!"}
{"text":"Great Happy hour with decent prices. I have never had complaints on food and the drinks are always on par. 4 star because the bartenders ignore most of the time, and typically have to wave one down to order a drink or food."}
{"text":"I was in town for a few days and met a friend here.  After we were seated no one came by to get our drink order.  We waited about 10 min too long and my friend got someone's attention and finally got our water.  Another 10 min goes by and a server comes to our table and tells us \"our server walked out.\"  At this point, the manager should have came and told us what was going on and at least offer something or an apology but at least our server apologized.  I finally ordered the pasta Brio which was lacking flavor and dry.  The place looked promising but was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"I was surprisingly delighted by this restaurant, given the fact it is a chain restaurant.  Every time I have visited this establishment, the food has always been great along with the drinks,  My favorite by far is the chicken limone, the pasta is nicely seasoned and I LOVE capers!  All the flavors are nicely pulled together and it is delightful as leftovers too!  And their white peach sangria can rival Firefly's sangria...lol.  

It's also a great place to gather with friends, as the patio gives you an opportunity to people watch and they have a few fire pits outdoor to keep you warm while chatting and drinking.  I definitely encourage people to swing by and enjoy the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday last year for happy hour appetizers and sat outside on the patio with some friends, we all had great time. We were there so long it was closing and had to leave!

The creme brulee was nothing like id every tasted! Im looking forward to going back for dinner and more creme brulee!"}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere were ok. Nothing I would rush back for. Prices were high for items served."}
{"text":"The food was good when we finally received it. Roughly 27 minutes after placing our order we were told that they were out of New York strip that my girlfriend had ordered. So it took even longer to actually receive our food. The waiter was moody at best, he would grab our plates with no interaction, didn't respond when I said thank you. Felt very distant. I wish I had a better experience because the food was good."}
{"text":"Brio Tuscan Grille is one of my favorite restaurants. So much so that I drive from Tucson to Scottsdale to go there. Their service is great, setting is fancy and food is perfect. They serve a loaf of bread and chips before the meal. I'm an east coaster who values good seafood and they have one of the best Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccine I've had in Arizona. Their Lobster Bisque is also a favorite. Paired with their new zesty Watermelon Margarita. For dessert I order the chocolate cake that has fudge in the middle."}
{"text":"We craved for Italian cuisine so my girlfriend brought us to Brio Tuscan Grille, an elegant and inviting Italian restaurant located in the upscale Town Square in Las Vegas. 

A waitstaff greeted us at the door as we arrived and directed us to our seats. The restaurant has a certain sophistication to it: chic, elegant interior with tasteful accoutrements, high ceilings, flowing drapery, and well-trained staff -- you wouldn't even think that this is a chain restaurant. 

The menu has a good selection of insalatas, bruschettas, zuppas, paninis, and pasta. They also have a nice selection of house specialties but I didn't order any of that. The wine selection is not too extensive but you'll certainly find the perfect wine to pair your dish with. 

The shrimp and scallop risotto was well-seasoned and flavorful; I paired it with a glass of pinot Grigio. My friends loved their dishes as well, which they generously shared with me (and vice versa).

The price range is very reasonable considering the restaurant's ambiance, the quality of dishes, and the quality of service that we got. Overall, I'm happy with the experience."}
{"text":"I've had great food from Brio. I guess I can't comment on the atmosphere because I always get my food to go, but it's similar to (the decor, table size, general layout) a Cheesecake Factory on the inside (I'm being an asshole-specifically because some guy was all 'I'd pass, Cheesecake Factory atmosphere' am I the only one who thinks Cheesecake Factory isn't so bad? I mean yeah they're a chain, but they're always pretty well kept? Whatever.) - clean, all of the wait staff are friendly. I always deal with the bartender and he's a nice guy. All of the food I've had had been delicious. The desserts have been a personal favorite, but the quinoa chicken pesto salad for lunch was also delicious and decently priced for the area."}
{"text":"Three of us took Mom here for her birthday, to try something new, for lunch.  It's in the trendy Tivoli Square which looks brand new and is stylishly done.  The walls, decorations, art and overall feel screams Italian countryside, complemented by the bright Vegas sun outside.  

We ordered one of the chicken sandwiches with the housemade chips, the mezzo chicken \"under the brick\", the grilled chicken risotto with sweet potatoes and I had the grilled shrimp with orzo.  Everything was good.  Nothing the blew us away.  The food is noticeably rich with butter and salt (fair warning for those looking for lighter, healthier choices) and is served in smallish portions perfect for lunch.  My family really enjoyed the housemade chips which were not salty at all and perfectly crisp.  

This place might have gotten an extra star if the service had been a little bit more personable and organized.  The waitress was friendly but she came back after our order and handed me a Caesar salad.  I looked back at her in confusion.  \"I didn't order a salad.\"  \"Yes, you did.  This is yours.\"  My aunt spoke up and said it was hers and she apologized but if I told her I didn't order it, I thought that should have been it.  

By the time we started eating, my mother still didn't have her side salad.  The waitress told us it would be right out.  After she'd brought it out, Mom said the girl dropped it on the table and said \"here you are\" while already looking to the next table and moving on.  Since she believes that service includes making eye contact with your customers when you are engaging with them, I'm mentioning it here.  

Otherwise, it was a good experience.  It's reaosnably close to Summerlin, but I think we'll continue exploring other Italian options before returning."}
{"text":"We stopped in after cruising around the mall area. Not too shabby, but kind of pricey for portion size. Fresh sourdough bread to begin with, along with some stale tasting crackers. 
Started out with the shrimp/chorizo bruschetta--which was enjoyable, but kind of messy! Combo of shrimp, chorizo, red and yellow tomatoes, and creamed leeks. All came together rather nicely. For dinner, I had a chicken parmesan hybrid, which wasn't terrible, but the sauce tasted a little bit like spaghetti-o's and there wasn't enough sauce to coat the pasta, 
Drinks were also on the expensive side--$13 glasses of wine?!
Was ok, not great. Our server was nice and on top of refills/checking in on us."}
{"text":"Salmon dish is fantastic!  Every time I've been there the service is great and the food excellent. Decided to have a bridal shower there and the service was the best . Have not experienced that friendliness and help in a long time. The manager was great and very accommodating.  Would definitely do it there again."}
{"text":"Overall it is pretty good. The food artistry was average and and the overall quality was decent.

The service, unfortunately, was slow with only about 50% of the seats filled. That being said the staff was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful time at Brio. Our server, Amit, learned our names and used them throughout our visit. I have never seen this level of customer service. He also squatted down and spoke with us eye to eye at least once. I also saw him doing this with other customers.  We dined at a Brio in Virginia a couple years ago. The food was equally good at both locations, but Amit has spurred us to visit on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"This was a typical chain restaurant in an outdoor shopping center. We came here for a \"rehearsal dinner\" before a wedding. I can't lie and say I was excited about going somewhere we could have gone in Cleveland, but it was a good meal anyways. The peach sangria was probably my favorite part of the meal! 

The selected menu we got had a salad, chicken, salmon and pasta on it. The salad was typical and satisfying. The salmon was actually really good. The sauce on it was tart and creamy at the same time and the shoestring potatoes were such a nice unique touch. The roasted tomatoes underneath were so sweet and savory at the same time, too. Overall, it was a tasty dish! 

I really just think I would have been more excited about this place if we weren't in Vegas and surrounded by other options that we don't get in Cleveland. (re: Battista's!)"}
{"text":"I'll be honest. I'm a cynic and I find flaws in other people's work for a living. I find it hard giving anyone or anything a 5-star but this review isn't about the awe-inspiring story of how I overcame being so an*l. Well maybe it is.

If I could give this place a 4 and half star I would, simply because 5-stars is reserved for the best meal of my life and I believe that hasn't happened yet. However, since I can't and 4-star would be an injustice, this place gets a 5.

Brio is easily one of the best restaurants I've been too in the past couple of years (tied with Hanks and miles ahead of Napa Valley win train). The food is exceptional! The service is impeccable! The decor is très chic (love the high ceilings) and the staff is attentive. If I had to make one negative comment it would be the unfortunate proximity to the airport. It gets REALLY loud when a plane flies overhead and I'm going to blame the high ceilings for the acoustic effect. Having said that, you're going to Brio for the food. You really can't go wrong with anything here but the Salmon is highly recommended.

Final word - Make reservations and give in to the food."}
{"text":"Very delicious food and the pricing is great too. We order their family bundles for delivery and there is always leftovers. It's really a great value considering the amount of food you get. The salads that come with are always fresh and never soggy. I also use the leftover bread that wasn't eaten at dinner and make French toast in the oven with it. Awesome service too."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch at the bar on a busy Saturday afternoon. The female bartender was friendly and knowledgable and recommended a win I really liked (Rocca della Macie Chianti). I did think the wine list by the glass was a little limited though. Had a caprese salad -- it wasn't summer so tomatoes were a little mealy but everything else was good. Great fresh and hot bread! It's a bustling place and had outdoor seating too."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and found this place to be a great restaurant to eat at. This place has a nice ambiance to it. I came here for a birthday party which they had a private section towards the back. The waiters and waitresses were real friendly and helpful.  It was real nice but it was real noisey in the sense that we could here the other people in the whole restaurant. Its a private area but it should have been sound proofed too. We couldn't hear the host or people making speeches. Other than that, the food that was ordered was ok and I would come back to eat at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I was looking for somewhere new to try for my birthday dinner this year and decided on Brio Tuscan Grille.  I was definitely not disappointed.  Everything on the menu sounded amazing and everything that came out of the kitchen looked amazing!  I ordered the Chef Special - Tomato Crusted Blackened Tuna.  It was so good!  Everyone in our party agreed that we will have to make a return visit!  There are many things on the menu that I am interested to try. Next time I will have to save room to try one of the desserts!"}
{"text":"I'm posting two stars only for the wine. If you loooove Olive Garden, you'll love Brio. Except in place of bottomless soup, salad and breadsticks, you get one tasteless salad. I ordered the pasta  bolognese and a Ceasar salad. Ceasar dressing should have a bite of garlic and the saltiness of anchovies. This mess tasted like it was pre made and sat in the walk-in for a few hours. Equally tasteless, the pasta. Here's a thought- garlic. It's Italian food for Christ's sake.
And if your diner does not eat the salad, before removing it, ask if it was ok. And when you sweep your section, look at all your tables to see if your guests need anything before running back to the kitchen. That's just common waitress sense."}
{"text":"This is very close to where I live so my gfs and I enjoy coming for their happy hours. The food is amazing, service is good too."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch right after Christmas.  The building is beautiful.  You feel like you're eating somewhere in Vegas.  I ordered the lobster bisque soup and the caesar salad.  The table bread was great.  The taste of the lobster bisque was good but it didn't have any lobster chunks.  My friend ordered the vodka pasta - it had bacon in it which we weren't expecting although it was good.  We ordered the molten chocolate cake - very good - and two cappuccinos, also good.  Because it was my birthday, they brought us a free mini tiramisu.  Except for the amazing interior decor, this place is your standard italian restaurant with standard fare.  I would return again for lunch."}
{"text":"Date/time: Feb 10 @ 9p

My friend wanted to try this place out for her birthday dinner. Online suggested a reservation. I had made a reservation for 845 but had trouble finding it and arrived at 9p. I apologized to the hostesses who were [very welcoming]. I informed them it was my friends birthday and left her name with them. They sat me by the kitchen. I'm very impressed with the atmosphere and maintenance.

My waiter came over to greet me, I ordered a water with lemon. He forgot the lemons and said he would return with them. He returned, no lemons, asked if I would like an appetizer. I ordered an appetizer chopped salad. 30mins goes by and my friend arrived. He comes to greet her and take her drink order, I reminded him about my salad which he got promptly. The salad was excellent. Good portioned and lots of flavor for only 175 calories!

We order the light selection mahimahi and lemon chicken. The mahimahi was very good, fresh, not over cooked and well portioned. The lemon chicken was juicy but not over powering with a generous portion of veggies. Our compliments to the kitchen.
I pushed my empty water glass to the end of the table and watched my waiter walk right by. I said excuse me. He came back. I asked for a refill and the manager.
The manager knew I STILL had not received my lemons, my salad took 30mins, and I was just overall not pleased with my service. She was very apologetic, got my friend a mini birthday desert, discounted our check, and took over our table herself.

Even though it was a rocky first experience I would still come back and suggest this restaurant. I'm very impressed with the management and kitchen."}
{"text":"Don't get the hype. The service is too slow. It takes 15 minutes to get a waiter, then the food comes after 30 minutes and multiple reminders, and now we asked a check 20 minutes and had to double check with the waiter and it is still not here... very disappointing. Not to forget to add that the food is ok but not special worth the wait and be patient about the service. Will not come here next time. There are better places out there."}
{"text":"Came here the other day while I was out shopping with my girlfriend, she had eaten here before so we decided to stop in.  We sat fairly quickly and we're greeted immediately by a friendly server. We ordered some appetizers to start, which were very good, I would recommend the calamari.  After our meals arrived, nicely presented and very nice portions. They even have a lite menu for those trying to be healthy.  The service at times was a bit shaky, it seemed like they had a ton of staff working and the restaurant wasn't even  that busy but our server was constantly running around at times neglecting us.  Overall if you are in the mood for some great Italian food and a great atmosphere I would urge you to try this place."}
{"text":"Okay Brio, I will give you the fact that your Happy Hour 'tasters' menu is quite good. I will even give you your bruschetta (the tasty steak is the best) is fantastic, but your service is seriously in need of some attention. When dining in the dining room, service is your typical average, however every time I have been in the bar for Happy Hour or for a quick bite the service has been some of the weakest in the area. Today we waited for 10 minutes for the bartender (who is the server in the bar) to come over to us to take our order. He hardly said a word and the entire interaction was simply awkward. The interaction did not improve (to my dismay) as time went on. My mom and I had a few giggles over the awkward moments but by the time we finished and had to flag down another server for our check, we were done with the giggles. If you go, try the bruschetta... oh, and avoid a seat in the bar."}
{"text":"Nice place, great service.  The Caesars salad was nothing special but the lasagna was excellent.  Only complaint is that it is VERY loud inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"***Update*** wow. this was my 3rd time here and the service was horrendous. this place lacks professionalism. hey brio, you can't charge the prices you charge without the service to back it up. i HATE HATE HATE the inconsistency of service in this place.

 today i felt like i was being punk'd. is this real ife? where are the cameras?

lemme me help you all out: Tamara is their best server. ask to sit in her section...if she's not working...GO ELSEWHERE!"}
{"text":"Phil was fantastic!  My wonderful friends Aluxa C. & Jeff C. sat ourselves at an outside high top.  Phil immediately came by w/ menus & took our drink order.  He had water & lavash brought out, which I skip the water every where.  I'm very picky on water fyi. 

The Mezza Brio pasta & Riccotta stuffed tortellini w/ Vodka sauce was absolutely what we needed.  It was creamy & cheesy.  Also we add lots of red pepper flakes for that kick!   Phil was knowledgeable on the menu since I was indecisive.  I always get the Salmon w/ sweet potatoes salad on the menu & wanted to try something new.  His recommendations were awesome new favorites.  The Benzinger Chardonnay on a hot day is so refreshing also.  

Overall, I've never had bad service or food at Brio.  In Iowa & now at the Galleria Mall there is a 'Bravo' restaurant.  They must be owned by the same company cause the menu & decor is almost exact.  Also the Town Square bartender's are always so friendly!  There are two sisters that work there that are the sweetest nicest bartender's & remember what wine you got last time.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed today when a party of 6 of us went to lunch at Brio and they would not seat us -- the reason given was that they could not accommodate 6 people.  Many times getting seated at Brio for lunch is frustratingly slow (even when no one else is waiting to be seated), but we've never been turned away altogether.  Seating seems to always be a problem here.  We had to go elsewhere for lunch."}
{"text":"More like a 2.5 rating, but I am giving it 3 stars because you cannot beat the happy hour prices. 

The atmosphere was lovely the food was eh mediocre. The service was not good at all. I was part of a fairly large group. We came in on a Thursday evening for the happy hour menu. The prices were obviously great but keep in mind it is a $3 happy hour menu so don't expect too much! The presentation of the food is awesome, but I cant say the same for the flavor. I ordered the Margareta flat bread, it came out little cold and tasted like tomatoes on matzah. Martinis were $5 which is a good price. I tried the Razzbertini and the Lemon basil. Razzbertini was OK nothing special, however, the lemon basil was delicious! very refreshing.

 I guess we were sitting by a \"break\" area for the employees. I'm not sure if it was a break area or a little corner they hide at outside and shoot the sh** with each other. Definitely should think about hiring a little bit more mature staff!"}
{"text":"The service started off great when we arrived for the 330 late lunch early dinner, that went downhill quickly. Our server Eric C. was either a newbie or shouldn't have been working on a weekend. 
We were consistently asking for water when we asked for a lemon it took 20 minutes to get to our table. 
I found overcharges for a dessert on our final bill which I asked about it was promptly removed but after the entire experience it left me a little uneasy."}
{"text":"I always love it here. The food is not to pricey and good! The service is always pretty much on point. This is a restaurant you could celebrate or spend any occasion at!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I finally had the day off from our crazy busy schedules and decided to hit Brio for happy hour. Decided to go to Tivoli Brio because townsquare is always so busy. Came in at 4pm, sat at at bar table, not busy at all. Server, no name was said, zero personality, and walks away before I finish talking. Not sure if he was having a day or was offended we ordered happy hour. Even though we ordered all but one app on the menu and cocktails. Food was so so and service was a complete fail. The 3 stars is for the spin dip and sangria. And the servers name was Clifford. Only knew this because of looking on my check. I'll continue my business at townsquare Brio from now on."}
{"text":"Love the Happy Hour at Brio's. Great food, drinks and people to meet. The staff is very attentive and want to ensure you enjoy your time there."}
{"text":"Had scheduled a Meetup for Happy Hour with a big group of people. Happy hour is only available in their bar area (too small for big groups) & their patio. Well unfort. found out that day due to the Vegas winds they close their patio so I was stuck having a big group coming & expecting Happy Hour menu prices. Luckly I spoke with the manager, Craig who was so nice to accommodate for my group & I & set us up in their Chef's room with Craig as our waiter. They let us order off of the HH menu. Was so grateful that my plans were not ruined & I wouldn't be disappointing my Meetup groups!! Thank you so much Craig!!! Craig, our waiter was great too! They have great choices for drinks & food on their HH menu. Fried ravioli is so yummy! Along with their shrimp & eggplant dish. I was soooo full due to their reasonable servings! The Rosa Sangria is delicious & light! I have been here before & definitely  will go back & highly recommend  this place!!!  Town Square is such a great location too with lots of shopping to do afterwards & walk off the food!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly delicious. I have to say there was hesitancy when we walked up to the front door and couldn't see anyone at all. However, after the hostess led us into the main dining area the place lit up. Delicious appetizers and a pretty amazing chefs special. Would def recommend this joint!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed. The service was bad.  I opened the wine for he waitress as this was her first time. The food was blah. The calamari was great. The sundae our son ordered was a mini scoop of ice cream with a little chocolate sauce.  Spent 150 for two adults and two kids.  Won't return."}
{"text":"Nice place. Comfortable seating.  Excellent atmosphere.  Food was 4 star (had the lasagna).  Downsides were it was a bit noisy and the waitress wasn't attentive and always in a rush.  She was on top of everything for sure, but very busy."}
{"text":"This place has something for everyone. Their bruschetta is to die for. try the sampler. You'll see what I mean. The shrimp bisque (I think) is good too. I don't remember what I had here but I just remember my meal being quite pleasant."}
{"text":"The food is good. The patio is lovely for lunch but as often as I have eaten here there is always a dirty plate or silverware.  Hmm,  it could be a possible reflection on the overall quality of the restaurant as it happens so often."}
{"text":"Met a girlfriend for dinner here last night and had a great meal! I had the risotto with shrimp and lobster tail. Delish! It also had asparagus, mushrooms and red peppers. Service was spot on. My friend had grilled chicken with charred cauliflower. Also great. We skipped dessert but they all looked yummy."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Tuscan Grille I have ever been to! Laurence was absolutely amazing as a bartender I could not say enough good things go about him! So amazing and kind knowledgeable and patient. Then for Steve the GM he was wonderful! Thank you so so much for everything to the both of you. This experience was amazing and more than anything I have ever experienced! Thank you brio team! Especially Laurence and Steve."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and was seated quickly. The waitress was in such a rush she spoke over you when you were trying to order. We ordered the chicken lemone with no capers and chicken Milanese. We also had the wedge salad which was split for us.
The salad was delicious. The entres came out and the lemone chicken had capers on it and we did not want to wait for a remake so we said we would eat it. I looked at my Milanese and found a 4 oz piece of breaded chicken on top of a half cup of pasta that was dry at the edges with a small amount of sauce. 
I questioned the size of the chicken and pasta and was told this was the serving. If I wanted the dinner portion I could pay up but it is mostly a pasta increase not more chicken. The Lemone chicken came with 2 pieces of chicken and my friend said the breading on the chicken tasted mostly of egg.
Ever since they changed the lunch menu it has been disappointing.
Not worth the price. Very noisy ."}
{"text":"Disappointing Easter brunch. Went to what was supposed to be their special Easter brunch today. Was told there would be the Easter bunny, which there was, an egg hunt, and special coloring pages for kids. Well, only the bunny made it. And the food selections were too basic: scrambled eggs, French toast, biscuits, sausages, bacon, potatoes. Also muffins and  Danishes that were obviously not made there. That's it. They even had a nice pre printed menu for the day. It's a pretty restaurant with nice atmosphere, but a real let down for special brunch."}
{"text":"Hands-down, Brio is one of my favorite places in all of Scottsdale and across the country as a whole.  I know that, no matter what city I'm in while on travel, I'll get good food and good wine from Brio and the staff is pretty darn professional.  I love Brio happy hour, especially the ravioli and beef carapacio and the Brio burger is BY FAR one of the best for a chain restaurant. 

I first started going to Brio a number of years ago back east in the DC area, and I've been a fan ever since."}
{"text":"This place is good but I don't think I will be dying to go back.  Happy hour prices are great but other wise its pretty pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Although the food was decent, the service here was horrific. My husband is allergic to onions and asked about a particular entre. He was assured that there were no onions in this meal. When the food finally arrived (after nearly and hour) it was full of onion. When we said something to the waiter, he proceeded to argue with us then laugh at my husband. Another waiter noticed the incident and promptly stepped in to try and make it right. We ended up paying for a meal that wasn't even touched and not once did my husband receive any sort of apology."}
{"text":"Brio is one of my favorite happy hour places. $5 martini nights on Thursdays is always a good choice, and the $3 appetizers are all very tasty as well. I like the beef carpaccio, ravioli (crispy with a yummy marinara sauce/ tomato relish), the sliders look good as well.  

The outdoor patio has a nice ambiance and a great spot for convos. There's section of sofa with a fireside as well but is normally taken up by a crowd.  A nice and relaxing restaurant to hang out (speaking of the bar and patio area)."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Appetizer specials were absolutely great.  Interior decor was very nice.  Waiter service was excellent."}
{"text":"We called ahead and told them it's my friends Jackie birthday I requested a piece a cake to be sent to the table with  candles they didn't do anything the service here sucks and I would avoid this place"}
{"text":"-Sunday Dinner -

The Good:
     The ambiance is very classy and comfortable. The food is presented nicely and is tasty. Options to eat inside or outside .  I enjoyed the teas, although my husband wasn't to crazy about them (to each is their own).

The Bad:
 This place is a bit more upscale then traditional restraunts. Prices for plates range in the 20+ neiboorhood.  It was also noisy.

The Ugly:    
      Slow service.  This place was busy , we did make reservations and we're seated promptly outside as requested. The location of the seating was close to the walkway along with many other tables. The servers rush powerfully through these isles making for a very uncomfortable hazardous experience to anyone seated along the walkway .    The service also wasn't great, after we were seated we weren't greeted for quite a while .   The wait in between was bad to, we waited almost 10 minutes to order desert, after ordering we waited another 15 minutes for a piece of cake. It was a bit irritating so we caught our server and said forget it , please just bring the check.  Then proceeded to once again wait a while for a check.  

Overall yes I will be back, we enjoyed the environment and the food.  We will just be more cautious of our server."}
{"text":"The food & atmosphere at Brio are great! Your experience will be lovely.... Unless  you sit at the patio side bar and Scott nonchalantly (after he's done chatting with other staff) comes to take your order. Sheesh, what an attitude! After a condescending explanation of no GF bread whatsoever & being called on that attitude, He intentionally ignored & spoke not one more word to us, it was almost comical but quite appalling & immature really. Dang, I wish Mystery Diners was filming him! The gal who manages that area made up for his arrogance & pettiness.  She rescued our experience there! The bruschetta Quatro is divine BTW."}
{"text":"The only reason I put 4 stars was because we sat in the happy our section outside and it took awhile for a waiter to come help us,but once Frank came all was well. He was a very nice waiter and our food and drinks came out fast. The service was great and the food was delicious. The happy hour menu is definitely worth while. We ordered the Brio burger which was perfectly cooked. We also ordered the eggplant fries, spinach artichoke dip,the sausage and pepperoni ricotta flatbread and the creme brûlée for dessert. Everything tasted wonderful. We would come back again for everything! I loved the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have a love and hate relationship with their happy hour....love the food hate the service during happy hr. We sat close to bar today and still no one saw us, went to the bar and was told the other bartender will take care of us, waited 10 mins before we were offered a drink....another 10 before another bartender decided to take our order. Asked for a bread basket 3 times still nothing, food got dropped off and that was the end of our service. Had to chase someone to get our check, I don't understand why the bartenders or servers can't just look over for a second and see that there are people waiting in the patio area......"}
{"text":"No problems here, it might be a little louder than you would hope but no problems at all.  The service has always been excellent as well, something much more high end restaurants in the area seem to be lacking."}
{"text":"Good Italian food for a chain.  The vodka sauce entree comes with frsh pasta and it is delicious.  Service is pretty consistent.  Sangria is really good."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing food and great service. I've been in AZ for 10 years now and I can finally say I found a great Italian food. Had the lobster n shrimp Fettuccine and my wife had the Pasta debiolio and she couldn't stop eating mine and hers."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant! They have the best pasta, drinks and awesome desserts!!!"}
{"text":"Brio is an good Italian restaurant that always seems to miss the mark to being a great Italian restaurant. The prices are great Italian restaurant prices, but the food and presentation, just miss the mark of being great. I say this because I like Brio, but I think it could be better.

We had been to Brio twice before in different states, so we knew what to expect. The decor is pretty much the same as other Brios -- kind of a Cheescake Factory, glitzy Italian Tuscany. The wait staff is friendly, helpful and professional and dressed in professional-looking uniforms. 

We were there because of a birthday coupon Brio had emailed me. (NOTE: Sign-up for Brio emails on their web site!  Before your birthday they will send you a coupon, not for a discounted meal or even a buy-one, get-one free meal...but a complete a la carte entrée for FREE with no purchase requirements!) 

The coupon we had was for the \"Beef Medallions with Shrimp Scampi\". (One of their mid-priced entrées.) We ordered the \"Brio Chopped Salad\" with our meal.

The waitress brought us warm bread and seasoned, thin, crispy flatbread triangles. (The bread was fresh, but the flatbread was not. Instead of being very crispy the flatbread was a little soft. Our second batch of flatbread was very crispy, though.) We asked for olive oil and balsamic vinegar for our bread and salad, but only olive oil and red wine vinegar were available in paired shaker bottles, so our waitress had to go to the kitchen and have them pour some balsamic in a small serving cup for us.

The salad was OK. The chopped greens were all romaine lettuce. (Thankfully no iceberg lettuce to be found!) The salad also had sliced red onion, cucumber, little bits of Feta cheese, a couple cherry tomatoes, and a couple olives.

The entrée included three tender beef medallions, cooked to our order, which were very good. The orzo with veggies was a good addition to the meal. The shrimp were a surprise because they were so tiny...Just little cocktail shrimp. I don't know about you, but  EVERYPLACE I have had Shrimp Scampi the shrimp have not been shrimpy...They had always been JUMBO SHRIMP! Even though the shrimp were tasty the whole presentation would have been more impressive had jumbo shrimp been used in the entrée, even if it meant using fewer shrimp!

After the meal the waitress brought me a little birthday dessert topped with a candle. The dessert was a shot glass filled with a chocolate mousse and a rich chocolate cake. I was surprised that instead of being topped with whipped cream, it was topped with what seemed to be Dream Whip! A disappointment to an otherwise very nice dessert.

I don't think I would order the \"Beef Medallions with Shrimp Scampi\", again, but there are plenty of other things I would like to try in the future. 

Brio is not my favorite Italian restaurant, but I have enjoyed it the times I have eaten there."}
{"text":"I was hesitant trying Brio, as it looked like a generic upgrade to the Olive Garden. And there definitely are points that embrace the chain restaurant blandness (atmosphere), but thankfully, the food is done well. I had the portobello ravioli and my date had the frutti di mare (it was a special). The ravioli was excellent. While the frutti was not as good as Mezzo's take on the dish, it still held up and was satisfying. Our service was adequate and friendly. Overall, most people will be pleased with the restaurant's large menu, quality, and moderate pricing. If you find yourself in Town Square with a group of people, odds are everyone will find something they like here."}
{"text":"Very tasty place! To start, mom had the Sangria rosa and it was light and delish! We simply shared some appetizers for lunch. We chose the lobster bisque, the bruschetta Quattro, and the calamari fritto misto. 

The lobster bisque was wonderful and had diced shrimp on top, great flavor, took the sourdough bread and wiped the bowl clean! The bruschetta Quattro had 3 yummy flavored bruschettas and the seasonal choice, ours was an antipasto bruschetta. Wonderful crunchy bread and flavor! The calamari as always is delicious. It had great flavor with an aioli and typical marinara, but also fried peperoncini!!! Really tasty! Only critique is that the calamari' sauces are not served on the side but on the same plate so they ended up swimming in the sauce on the bottom on the plate...oh well 

Still good and we highly recommend it!!! Brio will definitely have us back for more!"}
{"text":"Better than OG but not authentic.  Restaurant is very nice and plenty of outdoor seating.  Service was lacking.  I will try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Amazing food and more amazing service. Strongly suggest being served by Frank! The absolute best waiter on the planet! He totally made our night!"}
{"text":"After absolutely miserable experience at AMC, my friend and I were in a rather foul mood. 

I wasn't expecting much from this restaurant but was pleasantly surprised. Salmon salads were fantastic. Tomato bisque was tasty. Establishment was clean, well managed, and service was excellent. Coming here salvaged the night for us. :)"}
{"text":"The Bread and ice tea are very good but the other meals were terrible. Chicken Lemon was not good at all the server got our order wrong. There were 9 of us so that could have been why. Not sure I am going to us the free appetizer card."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Brio, it was mid day Saturday in Crocker Park a nice shopping area west of Cleveland it was cold, windy and a few flurries in the air, the crowds were large its the holiday season and the procrastinators are everywhere. I ducked in to get warm have a bowl of something to recharge the batteries it didn't appear busy but there was real confusion at the hostess station laminated table maps covered in dry erase ink we must go and verify each table to see if there are customers seated or if they need to be bused or just vacant never mind the hungry crowd we must verify even before we write the names of the new customers down in the order they walked in, we can always ask who's next yes that's it we will use the honor system.

The crowd was building like it was midnight at Walmart on Black Friday now the staff huddles up to decide who gets a seat it's a lottery I don't feel I have a winning ticket but I'm close enough to get picked like an unpopular kid in a dodge ball game. The part time hostess looks at me, it seems she remembers I was here before this debacle began she grabs the menus and heads my way yes it's me I get a table no wait she decides to double check the vacancy the process comes to a stop I see a server waving they found a table bingo. We arrive it's clean and the silverware is inbound another pours the water and yet another sets down a bowl of bread and I think gourmet crackers things are looking up.

Let's make it easy and fast or fast and easy this is a quick lunch between shopping yes we all will have the soup and salad I want the Italian wedding soup the others lobster bisque. My choice was wonderful I would of liked it a little warmer but the taste was spot on, the tiny meatballs were tasty and plentiful. The lobster bisque was a little heavy on the sherry but also heavy on the lobster chunks no complaints from this group. 

It's Salad time two order the wedge two order steak salads both were very forgettable unfortunately. Wedge was not chilled and the dressing was sparse, light on the bacon and a few cherry tomatoes would not do it again, the steak salads were about the same it seems but they have chucks of tough steak piled on top.

Okay 3 stars for the food to be fair it wasn't a full meal it was a big shopping day and the place was busy yes I am making excuses for them because I want to try Brio again whether it's here or anywhere else."}
{"text":"I went for happy hour. I had the shrimp eggplant dish, brio burger, and the potato skins. I liked the items in that order. The shrimp eggplant is  ridiculously tasty. Brio burger is better than average. The potato skins are forgettable. Service was good and the sangria is tasty."}
{"text":"Came to town square to shop and was hungry for a great big salad so figured I'd just eat here somewhere. I asked for a booth and was seated right away with my friend. The waitress was super friendly and really patient with me as I couldn't figure out what salad to order. I ended up just getting a side of cauliflower because after looking at the menu and their Instagram and realized none of these salads were going to fufill my expectations. My friend got flatbread. The cauliflower looks attractive and has all these toppings on it but it's really so bland and not cooked well (omg have you had cauliflower at Carson kitchen? Bomb!) his flatbread was nothing to write home about either. anyway yeah this is just a middle of the road mall restaurant. No reason to return. Like, ever."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner on a Friday night. We ordered the calamari, which was delicious. The lobster ravioli with shrimp was also excellent. However, for the price, it would have been nice to get a soup or salad with the order. 
The service was a little slow. And the hostess center seemed to be managed by teenagers. Twice I saw the young men seating people just grab silverware and menus and walk off, leaving the customer standing there. I would have been helpful if something was said to the customer like, \"Follow me to your table\" or \"I'll show you to your table.\""}
{"text":"Love this place. Great happy hour with good food and tasty drinks. Never had a hard time finding a place to sit. Friendly service."}
{"text":"I have been to Brio multiple times and we always leave satisfied. They have cheap lunch specials which are always tasty. Last time I ordered a chop salad and a flatbread for like $7 and I had left-overs!

For dinner they have great pastas and meat dishes. I also love their panini's and salad combo. They also have weekday specials with $5 martini's on wednesdays!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was friendly, and recommended a few dishes for us to try. The food was good, but the restaurant was so dark we cld barely see what we were ordering nor what we were eating! One of my fav parts of dining there was the complementary bread basket ~it was good-hot fresh bread and crisps."}
{"text":"My most recent visit was not my first visit. Actually, it is among quite the few. Brio has been a pretty good go-to restaurant for a nice sit down dinner with a variety of meat or pasta choices. 

I was introduced to Brio about 5 years ago. And it has yet to completely fail me. Even with a recent experience of not mine, but two of my friend's Rack of Lamb order, they had messed up the temperature on the meat twice. One returned to the waiter, second time, even the manager and chef had come out. GREAT service and customer satisfaction. 

My most recent visit was for a friend's graduation party. She had made reservations a day prior. Upon arrival, took maybe 10 minutes from arrival to having table ready. Not bad? Had came here for my b-day as well last august, and it took about the same amount of time for getting table ready. 

We were seated in the back room (first time sitting in that room) in a 7 person round table. 

At first, service was pretty good. Quick for drink orders and first round of bread came pretty fast. But went downhill from there. I had asked the waitress for more bread. My friend had asked another person for more bread. Because we had 7 people, the first round's two bread baskets disappeared fairly quick. Let's say, all our entrees came out, and was more than 1/2 way through it before one new basket of bread came out. Could easily say it was at least 30 minutes. This was just bread. If the bread is being baked or not ready, at least tell us ! The bread was good too ! first round of bread, nice and hot. i wanted more ! *sad face* 

I had ordered the Bistecca Alla Fiorentina (14 oz. Strip Steak served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables) - $28.45 - Seasoned well. Meat temperature was perfectly medium rare, like i had ordered. Mashed potatoes were creamy and rich. Roasted vegetables were... well... roasted vegetables. Lol. The one thing i dont understand about restaurants is why do they insist on using serrated steak knives? Not only do they rip through the meat, requires extra force to hold down the meat so it wont move while the serrated edge rips through..... Im not sure if its a safety thing or what... id much prefer a sharp non-serrated knife that allows me to cut through cleanly. Even if the meat quality is low and not cut through like butter, it still wont rip through... just make me make a few more passes before it cuts through.. personal little irk that bothers me i guess. 

One of my friends had ordered the Brio Sliced Steak Salad (Mixed greens, tomatoes, Gorgonzola, mushrooms, candied pecans and creamy horseradish dressing, topped with grilled tenderloin and a balsamic glaze) - $15.95 - chopped greens topped with a tenderloin. Salad itself looked good and wonderfully dressed. The amount of meat she got was very little. I dont know if it really is a tenderloin but dang... i'd estimate the amount of meat that was there to be maybe 3 - 4 oz. For such a big salad, it was quite... tiny 

In previous visits, i have tried the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca as well as the Roasted Lamb Chops. 

Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca - (Perfectly seasoned topped with Gorgonzola. Served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables.) 8oz filet $29.95, 14oz strip $28.95 - essentially the same as the above listed Bistecca Alla Fiorentina but topped with a gorgonzola crust. Adds a nice flavor but the seasoning on the crust plus possible seasoning on the steak may double up and be a bit salty. 

Roasted Lamb Chops (Full rack, perfectly seasoned New Zealand lamb chops, with red wine veal sauce, mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus) - $29.45 - when done right, perfectly cooked and seasoned. tender and juicy. you get i believe 5-6 lamb chops. decent size. great for lamb lovers who may not want a steak. good alternative. 

Overall, despite the occassional lack of service, its still a favorite place to go among myself and some friends."}
{"text":"So we gave it another Shot

Ordered the Lunch Risotto. ( grrrrroooooosss) came with Bacon it was oily for 14$ i expect better Food
Compared to olives Garden & Carrabas this Place doesnt offer Good Food any more. 
Sems like they Changed the HH menu again. 
My fav pizettas are gone.  
I ordered the margherita flatbread which was so dry & Hard that you cant Cut it with the knive or Even Hold it to eat. Nearly impossible to eat. Dry dry dry & on the tomatoes oily   Who puts oil on a flatbread????

The Dessert : choc Lava cake was ok. Not very Good. Would Prefer a or One with ICE cream but was by far the best Part of our Lunch. 
Cheescake was very Good. Tiramisu too

Drinks. Ok but overpriced. 

Waiter & Bus Boys are very attentive & nice.  
Host too. 

So i will Not go back. We Tried it now so Many Times & for the Same price we had a 60$ Check for 2  i can eat anywhere Else."}
{"text":"Spent some time at Brio last evening with my wife at the bar. Waited ten minutes before being greeted and the service continued to disappoint. Seems the groups with younger ladies received the exceptional service. The wait staff at Brio should all be trained again on what it means to be in the service industry. Will never return to this location. The two stars was for the mediocre food we ordered the service deserved a negative ranking."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a snack at the bar and staff was very attentive and engaging.  I've got a goofy food allergy/sensitivity and the chef was prompted to come out and work with me on items he'd prepare to avoid said allergy.
Awesome."}
{"text":"We were here on a crowded night.. So hopefully it will go better for you.  The décor is very nice. The place looks clean.  However, our waitress was slow and kept screwing up our orders for a table of 12.  The lady next to me had to remind the waitress that she ordered a drink.  Another ordered Chianti but got a Cab.  I just waited.

It didn't go any better for the food.  I ordered the spare ribs which came out luke warm but were otherwise OK.  The lady next to me ordered a pizza that looked like it spent too much time under the hot light.  Two others didn't get their food until everyone else was 2/3rds done.  I didn't hear anyone rave about their dish.

Now the checks.... The waitress told me that she would take off an item that was never ordered.  When she returned, it was still on the check. Another person had a problem with their check.

I do not enjoy providing poor reviews... But this place needs to step up their game significantly for me to want to return...

 With one exception..

I have enjoyed their happy hour at the bar in the past.  I have always enjoyed their sausage flat bread pizza that is offered at a discount."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places great ambiance and always good food."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for casual sunday lunch dining. It is also a great place for dinner before or after a movie at Town Square. The main dining room has high ceilings with white fabric billowing across, while the private dining area is separated in a replica/ re-construct of the colloseum. 

My boyfriend and I ALWAYS order the  \"quattro\" bruschetta, which  allows the sampling of several varieties, including roasted red pepper and mozzarella and sliced steak with gorgonzola, arugula, fennel, tomato and Italian dressing. There is always one item of the quattro that change. 

A main salad that is a particular favorite of mine is the steak salad. The steak slices are prepared the same as the one used for the bruchetta. The dressing is incredible as well. I have also tried a chef special, which was a scallops with pasta. This may sound very generic, but the scallops were done so well that I now ask if they ever have it available. They do, however, have a great substitute, whichis the scallop and shrimp risotto. This platter is amazing. If you are drinking their chiantis or cabernet sav. it will help bring out the spice of the meal. 

I am a huge fan of desserts, and for me, Brio does not disappoint. One of my favorites is the panna cotta, which is served in small espresso cups filled with the panna cotta, and a small amount of shortcake at the bottom, drizzled with strawberry syrup.  I have also tried the tiramisu, which is great as well. And yes, I have had two servings of dessert during one meal  

The wine list is decently priced with a number of fine choices by the glass.

Again, one of my favorite places to go on a regular basis, but can be pricey to go that often."}
{"text":"Popped in here today for lunch with some coworkers- it's a lot closer to work than I thought! They were in an italian mood, but I was limiting carbs due to the night's Yelp Pizza Party, so I did not partake of any pasta during my visit. 

Service was fairly good- our server was very friendly and made a bunch of helpful chit-chat with us, mostly bonding with my dining companions over their love of carbonara, and discussing the best places in LV to get it. I appreciated his honesty in that he did not try to BS us about how the dish here is the best there is or anything, but he did say it was good- he personally does not like the use of spinach in the dish, preferring beans, but it's not offered that way here.

As it is, I debated between a few dishes- the shrimp mediterranean in particular, caught my eye. But I ultimately opted for the soup and salad combo, with the wedge and the lobster bisque- the salad arrived already doused in a sea of dressing, which surely took it far beyond the listed calorie counts. The bisque was an odd dish- the first bite wasn't that great to me, and I considered asking to switch it out for the tomato, but as I ate more of the dish it grew on me. Guess I'm just not a lobster bisque person? Duly noted.

My coworkers both opted for the carbonara- and both were underwhelmed with it. The dishes were huge, and they easily could have shared a single order instead of getting separate dishes, but one dish had overcooked pasta that was borderline mushy while the other was a good al dente. Both ladies were underwhelmed by their selection and had buyer's remorse, of a sort- commenting that they wished they'd gone with their original choices, but felt like the dish would be better here given the conversation with our server. Womp womp.

Seems like this place is best for a happy hour visit- I may need to take advantage of that, but I don't think I'm likely to return for lunch."}
{"text":"Great birthday dinner at the Scottsdale Quarter Brio.  Enjoyed their bruschetta trio appetizer.  Half priced bottles of wine included some great Napa vineyards.  Dinner choices were all very good.  They accommodated our large party with very good service and honored our request for seating by an outlet for a guest with oxygen!"}
{"text":"I love  this place and so does my family. Never had a bad meal and the service is always great. Don't forget to checkout happy hour."}
{"text":"Brio's has always been a 5 star experience before.  Quality has declined.  One of the silverware napkins was dirty.  The appetizer plates were dirty.  One of the water glasses had a black spot on the inside that came off after scraping it.  Asked for another water and the new water also had a black spot on the inside that came off when scraped.  The pasta was cold on top like it had sat too long to be brought out, and the spinach was undercooked.  Wish Brio was the way it used to be."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar due to wait for table \"turnover\". After a small delay service was prompt and friendly. Correctly sized lunch portions were well prepared and presented. Would recommend the salmon with angel hair pasta."}
{"text":"Allie, our server, was fantastic! Very attentive to our needs and helpful in making decisions on what to order! Highly recommend her!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love brio can never go wrong whether it's lunch or dinner here one of my favorite places... And the staff is always friendly and willing to make your order special for you on request I added chicken to a wedge salad it was delicious... Yum"}
{"text":"First time going to Brio and it was the most delicious thing ever!
My friend told me to get the Peach ballini, i have been craving it ever since. We ordered calamari, caprese salad, lobster soup i think it was, and salmon with spaghetti and i think a scampi sauce. everything was soo tasty. I cant wait to go back again. The salmon plate was a little too lemony but it was still good. Our server was very nice as well."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!
We went on Mother's Day just me my husband and son, hostess was rude and said they were booked for the night but we could sit in the bar. I had to ask twice about the booths before she stopped texting to answer me. 
We sat in the bar forever before we were greeted. We sometimes saw our waiter even when we stood up to flag him down he avoided us but was in the back where we could still see him talking, dancing and standing around. Even when we tried to flag down the manager he walked right by us twice. My husband's salad never came but we were still charged for it, our pasta was cold and just beyond disappointed in the place we picked for my first Mother's Day. Will never go back or recommend to another person."}
{"text":"Very rude uncalled for service the food was excellent though and that's why i gave two stars. The waitress (lady) outback serving the tables on Memorial day by the bar outside really needs to check her attitude. In the future I will give this place a second try."}
{"text":"First, the seating in the restaurant is beautiful! Sets an incredible atmosphere. There are misters putside in case it's too hot as well. 

The service was slow during dinner rush but once our orders were put in, things came out quickly. 

The bread is served warm and it goes perfect with the tomato bisque soup! The food was great as well. We had an issue with one of the plates we got and he offered to change things around but not wanting to be \"those customers\" we just let it slide. In hindsight, it's location is great and the prices were well worth what they were offering for food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I won I gift card here a few months ago at an event in San Tan mall. I was so hesitant to try this place, because the name just sounded too ritzy for my taste. 

Moving on to my experience at Brio. Walking in the door we were greeted by a very nice hostess. Our waitress Bernice was great! Very nice, helpful and attentive (without being annoying). She was very well informed on the menu items, and even split our entrée onto two plates so me and my husband could share without us having to ask. The waiters and waitresses were all very nice and helped each other throughout our meal. The atmosphere was very warm and inviting. 

The food was impeccable. We had the lobster bisque and it was the perfect blend of flavor and texture. Our main course was the Chicken Milanese, it was amazing. It is similar to what most people call chicken Parmesan only a lot better. Every bite was tender and juicy chicken. 

For dessert we tried the carrot cake and the mascarpone cheesecake. Let me just say it was heaven in my mouth. After eating from that other \"cake factory\" last night. The mascarpone cheesecake here was better than theirs. This place is a great place for a date or a quick cappuccino and desert. I highly recommend it to everyone to try it at least once."}
{"text":"I enjoy my night every time I come to Brio for dinner. Each time I come I like to envision myself in Tuscany... I know it's nothing close to being there, but a girl can dream ;)

I always get the bruschetta sampler which includes nine pieces of bruschetta. Three of their original, three roasted red pepper, and three of their sliced steak bruschetta... my personal favorite. My favorite pasta dish I have gotten is their Campanelle Carbonara. Their creamy alfredo sauce mixed with the chicken, spinach and bacon is the reason I continue going back. Campanelle pasta is a unique kind of pasta and adds to the dish. 

This past time I came here for dinner they have Risotto on the menu for a limited time and of course I had to try! I got the Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto and it does not disappoint! I recommend trying out this restaurant soon so you can have a taste at their Risotto!"}
{"text":"Came here once never again. I ordered and my food came straight out. It must have been another persons order who had cancelled. The food was warm at best. The staff were very friendly was the only positive."}
{"text":"Came for Mother's Day Brunch, party of 8.  We were prepared and had made reservations a week ahead of time.  We were surprisingly seated right away.  Was greeted by our waiter FRANK L.  He was on it all service long with us.  We ordered calamari and lobster bisque to start along with their bread.  Both dishes came out quickly and tasted good.

Frank made ordering fun and easy.  Called all the ladies dolls and sweetie.  He was just on his game.  I thought this was just a show because its MOTHERS DAY.  But we all were very impressed.  He was a veteran and served our country and mentioned that doing this was something he loved better and I can see it with every table he served.  He sincerely loves his job.  Every dish we ordered was delicious and no complaints from Grandma, who is always the hardest critic.  Shrimp and grits was a hit!!! Seafood pasta was tasty.

Being a busy day, Frank checked in on us frequently refilling our drinks, and was on top of it during our service.  We found out through conversation he had a 1 month old daughter at home and then we knew why he was soo good to our son and always had a compliment for him.  He even brought out some mash potatoes for him without us asking.  

The food was great today but the service was even better.  Thank you FRANK L for making our MOTHER'S DAY even more special for us.  If you decide to eat here, ask to be seated in FRANK L's section.  You will enjoy your experience so much more."}
{"text":"Service was slow.  Food was mediocre. Ambiance was like Cheesecake Factory

I would pass"}
{"text":"We went there two weeks ago for my husband's birthday dinner and he ordered the pork chops. They are so tender and full of flavor! That was the best part of the meal. We had he lobster bisque and I didn't like as much as I did before.

My kids ordered the kids meal cheeseburgers and they were HUGE! They loved it and didn't finish all of it. The kids alfredo pasta was my son's favorite also, he ate most of his dish. I had the pasta pesto and didn't like it at all. The sauce was so runny and hardly had any pesto on it. I tasted mostly tomatoes. The chicken was the only thing that was edible on the dish. I wouldn't get it again and we'll probably be back for more of the pork chops!"}
{"text":"If you drop by Town Square, Brio is a great place to eat anytime of the day.  The decor of the restaurant is open, energetic and elegant at the same time.  They have a nice private area for large party as well.  The food is delectable, as for the price it is reasonable for its proportion.  

Happy hours are a great time to check out htis place for the first time and it's a great restaurant to introduce out of towners."}
{"text":"Food was cold today and pizza should be hot.  Service was so slow,  by the time it was fixed I wasn't hungry.  Sad cause food and service usually pretty good."}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to come here a lot and my hang out place after work. I love their Salmon salad. The place is beautiful with high ceiling and it is located in one of the best shopping places in vegas. They have happy hour too and the bartenders are very nice. They have a patio with fireplace outside and during cooler weather it is very relaxing to jus sit there and have a glass of wine. The food is delicious. It's a great place to entertain guests or meet up with friends. They also have a location in Summerlin but I love the architecture and design of this restaurant. I recommend all the pasta and salad. They have a variety of selections of desserts as well. I love the salmon salad or the salmon dinner. It gets very busy in this place everyday, if you're a walk in is not a good idea unless you are just going to drink and sit by the bar. I recommend to make a reservation although when you have a reservation you will have to wait a minimum of 20 minutes till you get seated and maximum of 30min as it seems like they overbook."}
{"text":"This review is for their happy hour. Went with some girlfriends after looking at Brio's impressive happy hour menu online. 

It didn't go right from the host stand. The guy there looked at us like we were an inconvenience, no smile, no greeting. We told him we were there for the happy hour. He told us to find a place at the bar, it was open seating. 

We found a spot, really uncomfortable high tops. They have a few booths which were taken. My friend ordered their tropical Cosmo which tasted like syrup, had barely any alcohol. I ordered Pinot Grigio which was good. They have $5 wine specials on Thursday.

We tried the margarita dip, margarita flat bread and crispy shrimp brio. Our server messed up the order and got us potatoes instead of shrimp. I would give 5 star to the margarita dip, was probably the only thing I would remember from this visit that was good. Service was terrible, I would give zero, no one seemed to care about customers, our server was terrible, he never refilled any drinks or checked on us. We had to hunt him down for everything. 

Definitely not worth coming back!"}
{"text":"Whenever I want consistently good food and friendly service I go to Brio... It never disappoints. 

The location in Tivoli village is pretty busy on weekends and Friday night so be sure to call ahead to make reservations. :) 

Food Recommendations: 
I highly recommend the calamari! It's very good and comes with 2 types of sauce. 
The Caesar salad is also great! 
For main courses I suggest the steak salad or the Gorgonzola steak medallions. I've tried other things on the menu and always come back to those two! 
The lava cake is also pretty good! 

The service is consistently good as well! We had a waiter (Alberto I think was his name) that was super attentive and made the experience fun! 

If you have never tried Brio I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasurable experience here at this Italian eatery. The Lobster Bisque is my husbands favorite. I enjoy the Chicken & sweet potato Risotto. Their salads are also very good- especially their Wedge. Try the Bread Pudding- delicious!! Great service every time we visit!"}
{"text":"Fantastic setting, away from the strip, for a more quiet non-touristic experience.  Have eaten my way around the menu and love the Lobster Bisque, the brick chicken, and some of the best flat breads outside of NYC.  5 stars, for food, wine, service, and décor."}
{"text":"I went for my birthday lunch today. They were pretty busy for lunch. We got seated within 10 minutes, by the friendly hostess, at a lovely corner table near the kitchen. Our server, Tom, was on his A game. He greeted us and immediately got the drink order. What I appreciate is communication, and he let us know that he'd be right back. While taking our order, I let him know that I had a birthday voucher for Shrimp Scampi and beef medallions and my friend got the Chipotle Chicken & Bacon Panini with to Ceasar salads, in addition. The best was when Tom asked me how I wanted the medallions cooked. I asked Tom what the meat was and he said 'cow'. AWSOME! I laughed. The salads came right away and were delicious. Plenty of dressing and parm (the way I like it), with sweet Romain lettuce. Shortly after, came the fresh flat bread and bread basket with butter that tasted like it was homemade. This Brio seems more open and brighter than it's big sister. The food came the second my salad dish was removed and it looked beautiful. It tasted even better. It was an amazing birthday lunch and I am happy with our service from Tom. Thank you, Brio Tivoli!"}
{"text":"great food every time. although a little on the expensive side, the delicous food  makes up for it."}
{"text":"All around great experience.  This place is one of my favorites- great food, atmosphere, and service. 
   We were a party of 5 and had to wait for all to show.  The staff and service were fantastic, being patient and attentive as we waited for everyone to arrive, as well as helping them find us.  Lunchtime was busy although we never felt crowded or rushed.  The food was great and dessert was amazing (I think it was the Dolchino Trio).
     Our Server Victoria was especially good and she really made the whole experience for us.  She was engaging and pleasant, knowledgeable, and helpful, great personality, and she even took pictures for us. 
   We'll definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Food was great. The ravioli in vodka sauce was excellent. Tiramisu was really good too. Place was packed on a Wednesday night. My boy Donovan said it was Cougar city for anyone who cares. He also said happy hours are great. They also have drink specials like $5 Martinique on Wednesday"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Brio on Friday. Not sure if we would be accommodated due to it being a busy day. Even though there was  a lot of people we were seated in a timely manner. Davis was our server and he made sure he answered all of our questions. He guided us on what we should try as our first visit. He kept coming by and making sure our drinks were topped off. He apologized for the food taking long to come out - however it was out promptly. We felt welcome and will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that you shouldn't really decide on based off of reviews that you've read. You really have to visit the place and see for yourself if you like the food. For me, the pasta dishes taste different than what are considered \"normal\" Italian pasta dishes. The chefs add something to them (I think) that make the pasta taste... I don't know. Just \"different\". It's just not to my liking. Still, the quality of the food is great (you can tell). The ambiance of the restaurant is beautiful, and service is always excellent. Also, it's clean."}
{"text":"Lamb chops, lamb chops,  Lamb chops!   Great service,  nice patio, and nice environment.   I will return."}
{"text":"Amazing food and attentive service. The inside was nice and my food was amazing. I even scraped all the sauce off the plate. It was moderately priced and I know I'm paying for top notch food and service. Thy also have a rewards program with deals and specials often."}
{"text":"Happened to walk by and thought this must be the place our cousin was raving about.  So, I took a chance there might be a table and lucky for us, we didnt need a reservation.  We got there early around 5 pm.  We were immediately seated, and our server Dino was awesome. 
He gave us great recommendations like the Pasta Alla Vodka and I also had the insalata on the side.  
The bread basket kept getting refilled and the timing was perfect.  Our son absolutely loved the bread.   I think it was a mild sourdough? Whatever it was, it was soft and delicious. 

Our salads arrived and they were entree sized.   I tasted hubby's Caesar which had great  garlic flavor!
My wedge salad with goat cheese and parmesan dressing was EXCELLENT!  There was just enough dressing and flavoring,  but it was not excessive.  Plus, I was expecting a small salad but this was substantial and I had no trouble finishing it.
My son's \"mac and cheese\" arrived and he proclaimed it to be \"SO GOOD.\"  Rarely have we heard our picky son rave about any food. 
My pasta alla vodka consisted of heavenly pillows of dough filled with ricotta in a dreamy \"rosetta\" sauce.  I had chicken added for a few bucks more. 
I took a taste of hubby's angel hair pasta with shrimp which had a nice lemony flavor.  
Our server Dino was great.  He anticipated our needs and was at our table at just the right time.  None of that annoying repetitious \"Is your food ok?\" before you even had a taste of it.  My ice tea was refilled without having to ask. 
Another note, the venue is absolutely beautiful and classy in a warm Tuscany style.  It was not ostentatious at all and there's outdoor seating which on a cooler day would have been ideal.   However, it was over 100 degrees, so we wisely chose to eat inside. 
Since we were too full, we got a preview of the dessert tray for our next visit to Brio, the next time we're in Vegas.  Next time, I'll definitely save room for dessert.  There were individual servings in cute miniature containers, so we're not obligated to have to share large desserts. 
This place seems to appeal to everyone from the executive, families, girlfriends going out, dinner dates....etc.
Apparently, there are many Brios in many cities.  Too bad there isnt a Brio in the South Bay area!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Columbus, OH, and that is the home of Brio's.  The service and food are impeccable at all of the Columbus locations.  

When I moved to Phoenix I was happy to see a Brio's not far from where I live.  I went this past Saturday (April 29) since I was already at SanTan Village.  Let me just say this. 
 EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!

First, the bartender, Lewis (?), was awful.  Didn't know the menu, the beers, and was completely clueless on customer service.  This guy should not be in the service industry.

Next was the food.  I order the Prosciutto and Burrata pizza.  IT CAME OUT AS A FLATBREAD!  Also, that is not Burrata cheese - it was clearly ricotta cheese, and it tasted like it was just bought from the supermarket.

There is nothing good to say about this Brio's, and I will be taking my business elsewhere.

UPDATE (5/4/2017).  Someone was supposed to reach out to me from customer service to ask about my experience.  No one did.  PATHETIC!"}
{"text":"Love brio always the best food"}
{"text":"We visited Brio at the Scottsdale Quarter for my sister's bachelorette party.  The Staff at Brio were exceptionally accommodating.  They put us in a private room to celebrate the occasion.  Our server Danny was kind, friendly, and on point the whole evening!  And the food was delicious and authentic.  Thank you Brio for making this special occasion so memorable!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was always a fan of brio since there is one closer to me that's located at town square.  I think i like this one better though.  It is close to valet and it seems bigger.  I order the calamari and caprese salad with fresh mozzarella cheese and basil with balsamic glaze drizzled around the plate.  These were Pretty easy and typical dishes that u go wrong with at brio."}
{"text":"Food was extremely salty. Vegetables came out cold. Had the atmosphere of an Apple bees or Ruby Tuesday's. Food was extremely over priced for olive garden like food.  Very disappointed in the restaurant. Will not visit again ."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great.  I flew into Las Vegas and my client brought me to this restaurant.  We all shared the Brio Bruschetta Quattro and the mussels appetizer.  Both were excellent.  I ended up having the Grilled Shrimp with Orzo.  The shrimp had a nice kick to it and the orzo was cooked perfect.  Others had the Pasta Brio.  They loved it.  I'd have to say the service was okay.  They were busy though and we sat outside.  I'll definitely be back net time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Classy setting and decor.  Beautiful smell of garlic.  Awesome place (bar) to grab a drink with friends.  Wine is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"When someone says, \"Brio\" ...the first thing I think is Happy Hour! ^_^ 

FOOD: 
\"Beef Carpaccio\" -Thinly sliced beef, capers, baby greens, drizzled with a tangy sauce, served with a cheesy flatbread
\"Brio Burger\" -Decent sized burger (cooked rare, medium, or well) served with baby greens 

DRINKS: 
\"Pomegranate Cosmo\"  -slightly tart, very strong.
\"Blackberry Raspberry Cosmo\"  -more on the sweeter side, tasty with every sip!

TASTE: ***** [The Beef Carpacio & Brio Burger are by far the BEST choices at HH cuz the quality of the meat is fresh, the burger is finger-licking juicy, and the tastes are deelish!  :-9  And I've also tried the Margherita Flatbread, Steak bruschetta, Shrimptini, but only got tastes from my friend's order... not bad either.]
CONVENIENCE: **** [located at the Town Square Center, easy to find.]
AMBIANCE: **** [First-come, first-serve... mostly small areas, but the outdoor lounge and the HUGE fire pit are accommodating for large groups.]
SERVICE: **** [Friendly & efficient!]
PRICE:  $ [$3.95 for appetizers, $5 wine/ beer/ drink specials.]
OVERALL: ****/* [4.5-stars... for the happy hour specials... For great quality food at a great price = St-deal!]

And... what used to be $2.95 appetizers are now $3.95 each. HH runs 3-6:30pm.
Nuff said."}
{"text":"I could eat the carpaccio all day. It's THAT good, and not filling. The server was also really nice and down to earth. She would even joke with us. I haven't tried any other food at this location, so take what you want from this review."}
{"text":"Warm sourdough bread/butter are served before your meal... Oh my goodness! Chicken picatta is delicious accompanied by a glass of pinot grigio!  Lovely dining venue!"}
{"text":"Great food! The best I've had in a long long time!!! Had the black shrimp thing my goodness!!!Wonderful wonderful wonderful! Had the Angus hamburger it was amazing and had the beef carpaccio amazing food!"}
{"text":"Beautiful location. Great for large groups. The staff was so accommodating and attentive. It felt like we had our own personal waitress. We had a large, needy group and the staff did a wonderful job. We started out with the Roasted Tomato & Herb Pesto Bruschetta and Roasted Red Pepper Bruschetta. Soup was lobster bisque and the entree was Pasta Alla Vodka. The pasta was heaven in every bite. Everything the rest of the group had was very delish!"}
{"text":"Jessica made our 8 person party so comfortable with the fine menu items we had.  Pork chops were excellent, appetizers superb in a beautiful setting.  Cream spinach/kale were fab.  Will do again and highly recommend."}
{"text":"Returned for a birthday dinner. Service was yet again horrible. We had to ask for our waiter 3 separate times as he was never anywhere to be found. Food was delicious though. 
At the end of our meal we gave our waiter a gift card, and $100 cash to pay for the meal. The waiter comes back with the cash gone, and a remaining balance on the gift card. Uhhh what?! He claimed that most people want to pay with cash first than a gift card. I highly doubt it as I'm a GM who works in the industry. 
If you choose this place, eat at the bar. That's the only employees who seem to have a sense of what hospitality is."}
{"text":"After posting my last review, I was very quickly private messaged by staff from Brio. They asked for my contact info, and I provided it. I didn't, or at least believed I didn't, hear back from them after that. 

I was about to come on here and lower the rating to 1 star due to what I thought was a fake apology on yelp with no follow through. Wanting to do my due diligence though, I checked my voicemails, and found a message from the GM apologizing and inviting me to speak with him. (I guess I should be reviewing Sprint's service for the missed call instead, haha) we haven't spoken yet, but I can see that they truly are trying to make the situation better. 

As I said before, this had been an isolated event for us at Brio, and possibly on Mother's Day it was busier than usual and there was a miscommunication. Either way, I wanted to raise my rating to reflect past experiences, and the prompt and courteous treatment by the staff since my last review."}
{"text":"Best happy hour! They have a great selection of appetizers and drinks for ~$5/6 each. You must come early to get a seat! The seating for happy hour is small, inside/outside bar and a few booths near the bar. This place gets completely packed and they seem a little short staffed at times. I wish it went beyond 6pm but for the time it is available it is worth it! We ended up ordering 3 appetizers & 4 drinks and spent around $40."}
{"text":"Very good service
Very good decorations
Very good bread
Very good food
Solid five star"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service is great.  Must go to everything we are in town. Oh, did I mention you must have a cup or bowl of lobster bisque"}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and I stopped at Brio to enjoy a little happy hour. We had taken our dogs on a walk through San Tan Village and grabbed a seat out on the patio. You really can't beat the HH specials. I wish I had gotten our server's name. She was great!!! So attentive, and really went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great experience."}
{"text":"We came here for a Bon Voyage dinner for our good friend leaving for Australia.  Our reservations were through Open Table.  We were promptly seated.  Our server, Christa was excellent.  She worked with my wife to secretly plan to put a decoration my wife had made on our friend's dessert.  The appetizer, eggplant with grilled shrimp was delectable.  Sourdough bread and crispy flatbreads were fresh and fully flavored.  The Pesto Pasta with chicken as well as the Tomato Bisque soup was memorable.  Finally the desserts...unforgettable.  The Carmel marsclpon cheesecake withe the Australian  Flag on top, and the Tiramisu.  The restaurant was clean including the restrooms.  Valet parking $6.00.  All in all a great experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to this restaurant 3 times and dont know if we'll go again. Brio has potential as noted by our first dining experience but it seems to have gotten worse each time thereafter. We noticed the sauces have become watered down with smaller portions and when we called them on it we were told they do that for the happy hour crowd but we were in the dining room for dinner. They did replace the dish with the correct sauce and portions but we still felt as though they were trying to pull one over on us. When your spending more than $50 on a meal for two nothing should be watered down. The service which was amazingly good when they first opened has also slipped and we found ourselves feeling somewhat neglected at times with a forgetful waiter. Consequently, I've noticed we dont seem as motivated to visit them on date night anymore. Hope management cleans up their act."}
{"text":"I have  been to Brio a few times and am always satisfied. My party and I are a,ways seated immediately other then one time when we had to wait maybe ten minutes. The staff is very prompt and friendly.  The food is delicious! My taste buds have never been let down! There are a few things I would change if I could,the volume of the place is always a little loud for my liking for a sit down restaurant,,it's so open and loud it's impossible to be an intimate dining experience.  But  other then that,it's a great place to get some amazing eats! The quatro bruschetta is devine!"}
{"text":"Ambience was good, food was good as well the wait  staff was really bad. They have a good menu for after  hours 1.99 ordered everything on the menu, and did not serve all of our food had to complain to manager. The manager all of a sudden said that we had all of it, we accounted for the orders and it was 4 orders short!!! DId not like the experience there at all."}
{"text":"Gorganzola topped lamb chops with sauteed spinach on the side!! Most amazing thing ever! I would choose this as my last meal if I ever had to have one, haha, great food and good service almost every time I have gone. Also you cant really beat the prices for the wine"}
{"text":"We have been here twice now, but a year apart. The first time we went it was excellent, we had an amazing server, and the food was spot on. This time it seemed a little off. We all seriously ordered the same things as last time, it took us a few moments to realize it. I was excited as their Pesto Chicken Salad was amazing the first time I had it. 

SO the run down..
Mother in Law ordered the crab cakes, and they were excellent. The roasted veggies that came with it had me jealous. 
Son ordered the pesto pasta and really enjoyed it as well.
Husband ordered the salmon salad and it was a little over done and charred. I would have said something, but he isn't the type to complain. 
I ordered the pesto chicken salad, The chicken was a whole chicken breast thinly sliced into two, which is more than enough meat for me. The only issue is, by doing this it made the chicken VERY DRY and VERY TOUGH. I was really disappointed as it was perfect the time before. 

It was a 50/50% split on food. There are too many other great places, I think we will try somewhere new next time."}
{"text":"I have never been in a restaurant where I saw so many people sending their plates of food back and a manager apologizing to so many people.  From glasses of wine to my own steak, items were being sent back left and right.  I had to send my steak back twice.  Medium well is not that hard to accomplish.  The portions to price ratio is not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I'll explain the lack of stars.. eventually.  

So, we arrived and were seated with only a short wait - and the waiting area had lots of very comfy seats so it wasn't much of an inconvenience at all.  The restaurant is beautifully decorated, with the standard Tuscan paint scheme.

Our servers arrived (one was apparently being trained).. though our waiter didn't introduce himself, the receipt said his name was Rhett so I'll just assume his trainee was Scarlett.  They were very friendly and helpful, and we ordered our meals.

Firstly, our beverages and their bread selection arrived.. the bread was good.  Then our appetizer arrived, the Duetto Toscano Tuscan Dips.  I had a bit of each, thought they were both good but the Chorizo Fonduta was the best of the two.  Hubby, however, went nuts and cleared the rest of the platter... yes, he loved them both quite a lot.. though he gave extra points to the same dip.  The chilled Pepper Formagio was good, just needed something more.. not sure what.

Just a note.. the over-attentive staff was incredibly prompt at grabbing empties off our table, keeping it clear.  Definite kudos to them for this.

Now, for the entrees.. mine was the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto..absolutely fantastic.  The blend of flavors & textures was incredible, it was a delight.  Hubby's meal, the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca, got rave reviews from hubby though it was overcooked and had to be redone.  No, I didn't taste it.. gorgonzola is evil.  They put mine on a warmer for the duration or replaced it, I have no clue which it was.  He also got the Lobster Bisque which was probably one of the best I've ever tasted.

His side dishes, the mashed potatoes and vegetables, were not particularly noticable.

Now, with the food being good, the service being fantastic, and the ambiance/decor being nice.. why only 3 stars?  Because it was COLD in there, to the point of teeth chattering, stuffed-up noses, shivering bodies.. and I was wearing jeans, a sweater, and sneakers.. clothing that should keep me warm enough in winter, let alone early September.  I only ate a few bites of my meal and had them package it up to bring home.. where I could actually enjoy the food instead of suffering through it.  And, though I complained many times (and they admitted that they were aware of the problem), nothing was done.

Additionally, the food was becoming rapidly chilled and cold risotto is not a good thing.

Perhaps the rest of the food isn't that good and they want people to dull their tastebuds with stuffed-up sinuses?  I have no clue, but I know that I was beyond thrilled when we finally left.  And yes, I had even gone outside during the recooking phase just so I could thaw out a bit, only to have it all undone when I returned.

So.. it was good food, good service, but I doubt if I'll ever want to return there again.. not without Uggs, a parka, and a warming plate for the food.  Overall experience.. miserable."}
{"text":"I have dinned here a few times, as a girls night out having some app's, dinner with another couple, lunch for a employee's birthday and then as a family for lunch with grandparent's would say that the service has varied in....when is was girls night and we had some wine and app's at the bar, our server was okay...when it was lunch it was just okay....dinner was better. Food I would say is good, it just seems like the typical big box franchise Italian restaurant that looses that special touch you find in the mom and pop type of places...."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Brio Tuscan Grille and it did not disappoint. We went on a Friday for happy hour and was able to find a seat at the bar. TJ was our server and he was excellent. 
He suggested the two most popular happy hour dishes, the Brio burger and the black pepper shrimp. Both were delish. We are craft beer drinkers and although their selection was sparse, the Kilt Lifter did the trick. We are not Italian food people but the experience at Brio Tuscan Grille at the San Tan location sure made a positive impression."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Vegas in a while. Now I remember why I loved this place so much when I lived here. Good drinks, great food... Bring a group or come on a romantic date."}
{"text":"We always enjoy having dinner at Brio. Food is pretty good. Our waitress tonite made our experience even better than usual. A big shout out to Valentina for a wonderful job! Charming and efficient!"}
{"text":"My daughter in law treated me to lunch at Brio. I was pleased with the Gluten Free Menu, and had the marinara pasta. It was good, and it was wonderful to not have to worry about being glutened. The waiter was attentive. I like the atmopshere, it was warm enough to be seated out doors.  The only downside is the car entrance to Tivoli being out front, although there was a minimum of distraction from the cars. I will go again."}
{"text":"Wow - I was pleasantly surprised by Brio. When my friend suggested meeting up at SanTan Village, I wasn't too hopeful I'd find a decent place for us to eat. But we both really enjoyed our meals. There was a 45 minute wait for a table, but we quickly snagged a table in the bar area, which wasn't too loud or busy. I had a really delicious malbec and we both had soup as appetizers - lobster bisque and cream of mushroom. They were both delicious, and after eating the soup and the warm bread and flaxseed crisps they give out free, I knew we were probably in for a good meal. When our entrees came, we weren't disappointed. My friend had a scallop and shrimp eggplant spicy risotto (ok, that's not what it was called, but that's what it was) which was great and I had a ricotta-filled ravioli with vodka sauce - it's supposed to come with prosciutto, but they were nice about subbing mushrooms for me instead, since I'm a vegetarian. We didn't have any room for dessert, unfortunately. All in all, this was a really pretty, tasty, and friendly place for dinner. I'd like to return!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour food. Brio burger is amazing. The shrimptini needs to come back that was one of the best. Entree menu is very good too. Good place for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We went here on Mother's day and it was packed. The wait was at least an hour for the dining room, so we decided to eat at a bar table.  Service was a little slow at first, and the server seemed to be in a neutral mood, with getting drinks and bread for the table. My daughter liked the lemonade, and the sourdough bread was tasty. We order our food and waited. We ordered some more bread as we were hungry,. After a while, server came out and said they were making fresh bread and would be out in a few minutes.  Bread came out eventually and ate that basket pretty quickly.  The server started coming around, in a better mood, refilling drinks. He came with more bread and with a parmesean dip for the bread, instead of butter. Server stated he tried it once and loved it, and after we tried it, we agreed.  He said the entrees would be out 6-7 minutes.  We didnt mind the wait, we were enjoying our time there.  Food came and was really good. My daughter ordered a slamon dish, and was given the wrong one, but she didnt mind and ate it anyways.  The server had that taken off the bill, which was appreciated as it was the wrong dish.  I enjoyed the mushroom ravioli, my son loved the mac and cheese, and my wife liked the margharita flatbread.  We will definitely be back for the food and good service."}
{"text":"Worst service ever !!!!!  Rude wait staff...hostess told us to wait a few minutes when there were only 20 people in the place and 75% of the tables open. Don't waste your time!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and attentive servers. Tell them to pace the courses!  That cost them one star. But it's a great place to entertain a group of friends or family. Love the decor too!"}
{"text":"Even though it was Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty crowded, I thought the service was excellent. It didn't take too long for them to take our orders and bring our drinks with some bread. We ordered a sample of their housemade Bruschettas for sharing and they all were really good. My boyfriend and I ordered the Brio Chopped Salad and Campanelle Carbonara pasta to share. The sizes were perfect and I really enjoyed the quality of the food. They have a great selection of delicious desserts as well.  I recommend their Mascarpone Cheesecake - so good!"}
{"text":"Over priced food and not that great. Have been here several times and each time I get even more disappointed as the portion of the food reduces and the prices increases."}
{"text":"The actual restaurant is very gorgeous. The inside just looks very upscale. Prices are a little high but not too bad. When I arrived there was no wait. But it took 15 minutes of sitting until my server came to ask what we wanted to drink. After telling him he said OK WHAT ARE YOU GONNA EAT! so we ordered an appetizer and some pasta. I finished my drink fairly quick and the service was just ridiculously slow the entire time, especially for not being busy. 30 minutes later the food came which sucked because our appetizer was served with our entree... What was the point of the appetizer then. I don't know. Very annoying. After our food was dropped off the server never came back to our table. Never checked on us or refilled our drinks. I actually wanted crushed red pepper flakes and didn't have the chance to ask for any because he never checked on us. Finally when I saw him walk by I asked for the check and a box. Paid right away and left. 
Although the service was horrible I really liked the spinach dip. My pasta wasn't very good. I don't remember what it was called but it was rigatoni with a tomato sauce and chicken. It was completely flavorless."}
{"text":"Great dining experience.  I think Brio is great for business lunches and dinners, or for just hanging out with friends and family.  

Most recently, some friends and I started with the bruschetta quattro.  4 different types of bruschetta.  All delicious.  I ordered the crab and shrimp cakes.  Very tasty with large pieces of crab and shrimp throughout. I got to taste the tilapia which someone else ordered and it was cooked perfectly.  

Service is always gracious and friendly and they have a great wine selection for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"This was the first time I was ever at Brio.  My friends arrived around 2 for lunch before we went to the movies at crocker park.  I had the chicken under brick with mashed potatoes and a marsella sauce very tasty.  My friend had the lasagna which also very tasty and the Salas that was a lettuce with blue cheese it was great.  My other friend had a chicken pasta in a Alfredo sauce which also tasted great.  They also ordered the soup of the day a lobster bisque which they both liked as well.  We shared a bread pudding desert which also very moist and tasty.  The waitress was great and very good at what she does very knowledgeable about the menu.   She was a very hard worker and wish we had got her name.  Felt bad for her she was waiting on about 5 tables and the booth across from us had around a 70.00 dollar bill with a couple bottles of wine and only gave her a 4.00 tip!  Will be back when at crocker park!"}
{"text":"Tuscan harvest salad... Yum!  And who can only eat 1 of those triangle crackers?  Not me!  I've found that the service is better at the Town Square location but that the quality of the food is equal.  Sitting on the patio is one of life's little pleasures."}
{"text":"Brio has always been my favorite restaurant so I'm rather late on this review. I've been to several in different cities but Vegas is the best because of the scenery (on the patio) and the location away from the hustle and bustle of The Strip.

Today I was served by Jonathan who told me he was new. He was still very knowledgeable and accommodating to the changes I wanted made. He was great. The other serving team members removed my dishes quickly and were also courteous. Kitchen staff got my food out expeditiously as well. All around excellent service and wonderful food."}
{"text":"Hmm...well, we went back and made the mistake of NOT requesting Phillip's section, and the experience was as different as night & day.

After being seated, we waited 10 minutes and no one came by our table. After waving down a server not assigned to our table, we finally got water. After our appetizer came out, the runner took back one of the app plates to return with a different plate (that wasn't wet or dirty or something), but despite passing our table 5 more times, he never returned.

Our waiter never came back by the table to check up, refill water or bread. He only came by after we commented to another waiter, twice, to ask my girlfriend if she wanted more alcohol... \"No thanks, buddy, I'm good on water over here.\"

The food was still delicious, but we won't come back without making sure we get seated in Phillip's section. The service manager was so kind to comp our meal this time, which is what will keep us coming back - an appreciation for customer service. Ultimately, this is still a great restaurant with amazing food and typically excellent service."}
{"text":"i had a lousy piece of barely seasoned salmon over pasta and my wife had some bacon flavored garbage.....do not recomend this place unless u want phoney Italian"}
{"text":"Food very average.  I have eaten at this restaurant on 5 different occasions and the quality has progressively gotten worse.  He the last two times the red wine was served Luke warm.  I had the server check the temperature and it was 82 degrees.  Tasted like warm water.  He said they do not have a wine cooler for their Reds and keep them in storage upstairs in a room that is obviously not air conditioned."}
{"text":"A true weekly favorite for us. We just love everything that Brio has to offer. Robert behind the bar is just amazing. He always remembers our names and what we like to order!.... Thanks for being such a great place. Evreytime we have friends and family in town we bring them to Brio!..."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a late dinner at Brio.  We sat at the bar area and ordered a Caprese Salad and Pasta Brio.  Both dishes were delicious.  But what made this visit pleasurable was our server named James.  He was very attentive and kind.  Next time you visit Brio go see James in the bar area."}
{"text":"First of all, I'm a sucker for the Disney-esque fake movie set neighborhoods.  This restaurant is located in Crocker Park, a manufactured town of stores, residences and restaurants. Everything is clean and new.  Brio is one of the many restaurants.  Fake quaint Tuscan/Italian decor. I ordered the 500 calorie salmon salad w. grilled asparagus.  The waitress noticed as she was serving me, that it was sans asparagus.  She apologized and went to retrieve some, but came back saying they ran out.  She offered sauteed veggies, not quite the same thing.  Anyway, others in my party had angel hair pasta with sausage, which was okay.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to come back here."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything is tasty and wonderful . You start out with fresh baked sour dough with flax seed crackers. I recommend the shrimp diavolo (spicy), the salmon or steak salad ( both light but filling), the pasta la vodka , the crab cakes , or the burger (weird I know but they are super good). Save room for some Mini desserts . I always get the cheesecake! My favorite alcoholic beverage are the wild berry bellinis that are made with champagne! Light and fruity! Make sure you ask for Amanda M ! She is caring and the best server I have eer had!!!"}
{"text":"Located in Townsquare shopping center. A perfect place to rejuvenate energy for more shopping!!

Brio Tuscan Grille have appetizer specials for $2.95 each, everyday!!! How better can this get? You have nothing to lose if you come here. This special is only during their happy hours and you have to sit at the bar area or the outside patio. Once seated, you can ask for the \"Bar Menu\", and there will be 9 appetizers you can chose from. Heck, if you want to try all 9, the bill will only come out to $27 (plus tax).

BAR MENU:
Brio Burger
Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread
Sliced Steak Bruschetta
..etc"}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour. Ordered the Crispy Eggplant Fries, Tomato Margherita Flatbread Pizza, & Crispy Cheese Ravioli. Food was meh. Eggplant fries were extremely greasy. Pizza didn't have any taste & was completely cold. Cheese ravioli was the best of the thee but was greasy as well. I've frequented Brio's happy hour in the past & have never had that gross of food. Tummy is upset a couple hours afterwards due to the grease. Bar service was good."}
{"text":"Brio is a chain Italian restaurant. I would rate it a step above Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. Although I'm not usually a fan of chain restaurants, there are so many other places to eat! But the reason I like Brio is because they have a great happy hour menu. 

On Thursdays during HH, martinis are just $5 and the HH food menu has really delicious small plates for only $2.95 each! The girls and I usually order one of everything (don't judge) and justify all that food by telling ourselves it's ok because we're eating early aka during HH time. Some of my favorite small plates are:

-pepperoni flat bread
-spicy shrimp and eggplant
-spinich and artichoke dip

Brio is worth a try for HH with friends."}
{"text":"Beef Carpaccio, Spicy Shrimp, Spinach Artichoke Dip...Sangria.....enough said?  Fabulous happy hour menu! Great atmosphere. The patio/bar area is fantastic.  The manager Craig is also amazing!   We will be back here soon."}
{"text":"I was so hopeful for Brio!  Walking in for the first time you notice the place is beautiful, hats off for the over all look and feel. 

I had to give it a 2 for the overall service and food, which was not good. 

Service: Our server seems like a nice guy but we noticed after our food came out he wasn't around much. They forgot dressing on one of our main course salads and we were halfway done with the meal before it was finally brought out. I observed our server visit the two tables next to ours 4 times before he came back to our table, and that was only because we flagged him down asking for an eta on the dressing and to order another drink. 
Unfortunately the drink my coworker ordered came out with our final bill. The server apologized, saying he forgot to give the drink order to the bartender. 

My coworker ordered a salad and minestrone. He took a bite of the soup and said something was wrong with it. After teasing him for being a picky eater I took a bite just to see if it was off. It was BAD...it was if they accidentally put too much of some random spice it it and called it a day. We asked not to be charged for it. 

I hate to be that guy... but we were all disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"We tried the bruschetta trio and the bisteca salad and was A-OK I could have done with just the salad. The Mr. ordered a fettuccine pasta in which the pasta was totally underdone not aldente. The bottle peach ice tea from Italy was very good. The server brought over the dessert tray and we had to pass. Just was not impressing"}
{"text":"The service is terrible. The girl who sat us was rude. It took over seven minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we were there.  After we finally got drinks and a menu, we were hurried to order our food. When our meal arrived, it was cold and the flatbread was soggy.There's too many good restaurants in this town to deal with bad service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"I have been to the Tivoli location three times--once on opening day, once last week for lunch, and today for Sunday brunch.  Opening day was pretty good for a first go--service was exceptional (thanks, Justin!), but the food was cold.   Last Wednesday for lunch was excellent all around (Mediterrean salad and mezza chicken, both great).  Today for brunch--food was excellent (pork chop, white chocolate raspberry French toast, and spinach mushroom fritatta), but service (server was John) was sub-par at best.  Lots of servers, bussers, hostesses, etc., but there was a great deal of confusion amongst employees.  Go to the Town Square location until they get the bugs worked out here."}
{"text":"Went with a few friends the other night and had a great time. I thought the crowd was a bit douchey but hey, this is the Scottsdale Quarter. We cramped into seats at the bar with some weird dance music playing which is strange for an Italian restaurant but again, they are catering to the Quarter crowd. I ordered a martini with no olives, confirmed that the bartender heard me say no olives yet somehow had 3 olives taking up room and polluting the taste of my vodka. Not only that but the pour was extremely low, were talking about half way, and I had 4 martinis throughout the course of the evening and they all were half pours which sucks at $10 a pop. A real pour goes right to the brim. I had the Chicken Milanese which was extremely tasty, I would definitely order it again. The red sauce was awesome and the pasta tasted like it was freshly made. Their spin/art dip was very good as well. Everyone at the table fully enjoyed their dishes and the waiter, although seemed new to the game, did a great job. I would go here again and after seeing their happy hour specials will definitely add it to my list. I will try their filet next  time since my buddy swears by them."}
{"text":"Loved their Pasta. Great Service too. My favorite restaurant in TownSquare. Definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Our party of four was there on Saturday evening, 7/29/17.  It was just ok....The best part of the experience was the super easy reservation process with OpenTable.  Server was reasonably efficient.  It was a VERY LOUD restaurant!!  It was hard to hear our table conversation.  Manager came to ask about our meals, but made NO EYE CONTACT while we answered that everything was fine.  Not sure I'd go back."}
{"text":"Jam packed on a Friday night, however, it was a late dinner.  The bar area was overcrowded with the lingering happy hour crowd.  The crowd thinned out and the noise was tolerable.  The food was good with the fresh parmesan,  The drinks were strong.  The company was excellent.  Thank you Cari Brisendine for a great evening."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible time management by red headed waitress. Waiting for table at bar and she takes 20 minutes to get them their change after check was dropped off. I don't know how they felt, but I was less than thrilled. 
Both Brio's have one of the best Happy Hours in town, but no space to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Delicious restaurant ! So so so good everything and we had the best server Tamra moline she was so sweet and efficient always knew what we needed before we even asked absolutely amazing definitely recommend for anyone"}
{"text":"Service was above average. Super nice and attentive.

Food was super good. Didn't make me feel like shit like I'd normally feel after eating at Olive Garden or other Italian places.

It was clean and fancy. It's worth the higher prices.

I had lobster and shrimp fettuccini and lobster bisque. They were both really good. The bisque was a little saltier than I prefer but stil was super good.


I'd recommend coming here on a nice fancy"}
{"text":"We decided to dine on the patio because it was warmer then inside, the snowbirds have to be accommodated, they like it cooler.
We were seated approximately 25 minutes after we arrived and it was worth the wait. The basket of warm ciabiatta bread and flatbread was consumed without caring about our low carb diets. Norma had the lobster bisque and I had to fight for a taste, she ate as if she had a date with the electric chair. 
I started my dinner with the Bistecca Insalata (wedge lettuce) with gorgonzola,bacon,roma tomatoes and creamy parmesan dressing, the wedge must have been cut from a basket ball size head of lettuce !! I could have shared it with Norma ,could have, did not. I ordered the braised beef fettuccine with cremini mushroom, it was fantastic and the bottle of Malbec (red wine) agreed for pairing her up with a great dish.
Norma had the wood grilled salmon and she repeatly told me it was the best she ever had, was it her Cosmos talking, I was able to sneak a forkfull and Wow ! I bet that salmon was leisurely swimming just hours ago.
We passed on desert, I always do and we both had plenty of food to enjoy at a later date.
Our server Tonya was pleasant and very friendly, I wished she could have sat down and had dinner with us."}
{"text":"First visit~ We loved everything about Brio~!!! The service, food, ambiance~!!   Great HHour, etc. ."}
{"text":"I love the Scottsdale Quarter in general. The shrimp crab cakes are so good. I'm typically not one that likes the sauces that come with the food. But the sauce that comes with the shrimp crab cakes is so good. My waiter was so nice and personable I do wish I could remember his name."}
{"text":"We had reservations. But they don't seem to matter when it's a party of 9. The manager apologized and 45 mins later we were seated. They made up for it tho with complementary appetizers and prompt waitress and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I visit this establishment! It doesn't matter how busy the bar area is I always feel well taken care of! Try to visit on an evening TJ is working! Warm disposition, excellent service and never have to ask twice for anything, plus he's always good for a great laugh!!! Keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Great food and many options! Service was great we loved Brittany and San Tan Mall location!"}
{"text":"The one star is for the service, not the food.  The food is pretty good, and the steaks are always seasoned and cooked perfectly.  However, service was awful.  Even though the dinner rush had not even hit yet our waiter rarely came by our table.  They FORGOT our appetizer.  They brought out the bread basket late and with only half the bread.  Service was terrible.  Very disappointed since Brio has historically been one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"balsamic strawberry chicken salad, one of the best salads I have ever had. I munched off of my friends dishes and everything was good, don't remember what they ate by name maybe post pictures sometime.  Drinks were really good as well."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, delicious food, and great environment. The bar menu is superb and really affordable. Great value!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on Friday eve.  It was a birthday celebration and made reservations for our party of eight.  All was great with the service.  Not any complaints from me there.  But.....the place is very noisy and to hold a conversation is nearly impossible without shouting and/or repeating yourself.  My major complaint was the food.  I had a pasta dish that was so salty!  At first i thought it was just me.  But, I spoke with others (later on) in my party and they thought their meal was extra salty too.  My pasta was also on the cold side and was clumped together...really not good at all.  I had the creme brole for dessert and that was good.  All in all, for the price and the food, I doubt I will be returning."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best places to hang out in North Scottsdale. Great wine, an awesome happy hour, and lots of tasty, healthy food to choose from. It has a classy, dressed up vibe, while being casual at the same time and not too expensive. Great value here and service is pretty darn good too"}
{"text":"The service was spot on, it is a chain so there are locations all over. I do like the San Tan location because it's close and i have always gotten great service here. 

My recommendations: 
- Lobster Bisque: It's warm, creamy deliciousness. 
- Bistecca Insalata: their version of a wedge salad, with gorgonzola, bacon, roma tomatoes and creamy parmesan dressing (so scrumptious!)
- Brio Chopped Salad: chopped greens, cucumbers, onions, olives, tomatoes, feta and red wine vinaigrette. 
- Veal Milanese: veal scaloppine with white wine lemon caper sauce (the caper sauce is amazing!) It also comes with fettuccine alfredo too. 

They do offer a couple gluten free pastas which is nice! The only thing that i am not in love with here are their desserts. We all know i have a sweet tooth but i haven't found anything here that has blown my socks off. 

P.S. The Brunch here is fabulous. (Sat & Sun until 3:30pm) My two fav's are the Open Faced Chicken & Avocado Omelet and the Berries & Cream French Toast."}
{"text":"Yum! Always got the steak salad here and after moving away I had to go back when I visited."}
{"text":"The restaurant was out of the 1/2 grilled chicken entree at 6pm on a Saturday, so I ordered a steak.  The steak was bland and unenjoyable.  My friend ordered the pork chop and it was way over-cooked.  The grilled chicken my wife ordered was smothered in Pesto sauce but still had zero flavor.  This chain has succumbed to the same mistakes made by Macaroni Grill, Outback and Red Lobster--poor food quality driven by prepared foods and a low-skilled kitchen staff."}
{"text":"We've gone to Brio a couple of times now and have been pleased. This most recent time, I went with my mom & bf and really enjoyed our experience. Our waitress came by after we were seated and took our drink orders immediately. She was great in coming by the entire night to check on us if we needed anything, got us drink refills, etc.

For food, my bf really wanted some eggplant. Although there's no entree with eggplant on the menu, our waitress said that the kitchen would be able to make eggplant parmesan. Exactly what he was looking for! Me and my mom shared the Pasta Brio with chicken. I snagged a bite of the eggplant and thought it was cooked well, the breading wasn't too thick & it was really flavorful. Only thing lacking was maybe a bit of the pasta sauce since there was quite a bit of pasta that came with the dish. The Pasta Brio was cooked al dente and even though the split portion looked small, it was actually very filling. My mom doesn't like mushrooms so I got all of them, which made me realize that there were actually more than I thought/expected! They didn't skimp on those nor the portion of chicken.

The prices of the entrees are a bit on the high side, however I think for the quality of food, I can still justify giving them a solid 4 stars. We'd recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Great calamari & lava cake!  Mediocre service, entrees were served cool-warm.  Think our server couldn't handle all of clientele."}
{"text":"Brio has my favorite tomato bisque.. I recently learned you can only get it on certain days though, so fair warning.  Their beef carpaccio comes out on this gigantic plate with salad on top, and there do a peppered shrimp over fried eggplant in this amazing sauce.  I mention the last two since they're on a new happy hour menu available at the bar.  The carpaccio is smaller on the happy hour menu but it's also like $3 and change and you can treat the menu at the bar like a bunch of small places.  The steak salad is great... I've never had their sandwiches but a friend who ordered one wasn't impressed.  I just wouldn't think of sandwiches first when going to Brio anyway."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great service....and just average food. The bread was stale, the salad was bland, as was my entree. It's a 1/2 step above Olive Garden. 

I ordered the special salad and the creamy Parmesan dressing was bland. My entree was the medallions of beef, and the meat was lacking any flavor. The mashed potatoes were really average, and the green beans were actually good. 

You can do much better Italian- but it's certainly a nice place."}
{"text":"Update: We have since returned to the Crocker Brio and my negative experience was an isolated experience. Back to awesome. 

Normally a trip to Brio is awesome and so I visit frequently at Legacy Village and Crocker Park, but on a recent visit to the Crocker Park Brio, I was disappointed. The steak in my steak salad was a little charred on the outside and I was expecting medium like it is typically prepared there. Our waitress never asked if we wanted refills and we were drinking wine by the glass. P.S. I wanted a second glass but never got it because she never came by. Needless to say she didn't ask us if we wanted dessert either. Serious bummer."}
{"text":"We visited BRIO on June 16 after a very unpleasant (uneaten) lunch experience at La Madeleine around the corner... walking the 100 yards or so over to BRIO, muttering to ourselves all the way \"we should have known better\".

Upon arrival we were greeted by the same realization of what we were about to experience; beautiful, relaxing atmosphere, background sound levels just right to enjoy conversation without raised voices, competent & friendly table service, and PROFESSIONALLY prepared food.

That afternoon we chose to share the Wedge Salad (with Gorgonzola, bacon, tomatoes, creamy Parmesan dressing) and a plate of Mezza Chicken Milanese (Crispy Romano chicken over herb pasta with Mozzarella & pomodoro sauce), and complimentary crusty bread and rustic crackers. All were ample to share, beautifully presented, and delicious.

Just some of the many reasons why we've been coming to BRIO regularly since the very first day they opened.

Our total $18.70 (plus tax)... only $4.32 more than the noisy, cafeteria style place around the corner with unacceptable food. 

(Please see our review of La Madeleine for details)."}
{"text":"My review is for the Happy Hour.  We were lucky enough to score a table as we got to Brio at exactly 4pm, had we waited 15 minutes and we would have been out of luck.

I'm usually skepticl when it comes to HH menus but this place is amazing.  The food was $3 or $4 bucks a plate and the drinks around $5 depending on what you got. 

The selection was fantastic and even better was the service.  There was 6 in our party and we ordered quite heavily on both the food and drink menus.  Our server was on top of it.  He was pleasant and friendly and really added to the experience.

The food was out-friggin-standing.  We got the pepperoni/sausage flatbread and it was defnitely a favorite amongst everyone.

The deep fried raviolis were top notch too.  We got the lettuce wrap cups and sliders.  

We also did dessert, I did the marscapone cheesecake and it was amazing.  

I am now confident I will return many, many times."}
{"text":"Brio is one of my favourite brunch spots on Saturday and Sundays, the beef carpaccio is also quite tasty, staff are always accommodating as well. I do have a brio reward card and you get a discount after 5 visits I believe so that's a plus! Bruschetta sampler is a must also very tasty another favourite of mine. The drinks are pretty good I like the cucumber Basel smash. All and all I've not been disappointed with the service here or the food."}
{"text":"this is for the Happy Hour only.  it is GREAT!!! all the HH food is only $2.95. we had both the flat breads,  slice steak bruschetta (my fav) shrimp & eggplant, ravioli caprese and pepper formaggio dip. i highly suggest all. the service was great. the waitress was really helpful, friendly and courteous to us tourists.  we were there on TUES nite around 4pm and is was already getting crowded. right across from the SUNCOAST CASINO. we had a great HH."}
{"text":"Yum! Went there for the first time last night with my girlfriends and it seemed lovely. Decently priced food, good service, and wonderful ambiance. I got the blackened tilapia meal served with veggies for around $15, got a peach Bellini and glass of prosecco (under $8 each) and a chopped salad to start. Love tivoli restaurants and the patio here allowed me to take in the feel of the cute village."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food but the slow service took away from the experience. I have been here several times before this and had no issues. I'll give them another try ... being located in the middle of Crocker Park is a definite plus."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very casual. Beautiful food display and awesome customer service. The chicken strawberry salad is delicious. The shrimp and egg plant appetizer is huge and definitely made for sharing"}
{"text":"This place has not disappointed me in the 5 years I have been going there.   Their happy hour is excellent, dinner menu is great and the service is always very good.  My server this time was Vivianne and she went beyond the call of duty, had incredible manners, very friendly with great suggestions about the food.  I am truly impressed"}
{"text":"I should have written this earlier as it has been over a month but the poor service was memorable enough to have me writing this a month late.  I chose to go to Brio for my birthday dinner after having had lunch their with my mom.  So here are my two reviews:

Lunch: Service was slow to get started but once our waiter started he was great.  My mom and I shared the bruschetta quattro and the Insalata Roma.  The Bruschetta's were good and the salad was excellent.  We also shared some mini chocolate dessert that was as good as those little shot glass desserts get.  We really enjoyed sharing the bruschetta and experiencing the different flavors.  The atmosphere  was wonderful so I wanted to try dinner.

Birhday Dinner: My husband had called ahead of time to make reservations and let them know it was my birthday and that we would want some sort of birthday dessert.  When we arrived we were seated right away.  As I was reviewing the menu I watched the table across from us as they seemed to be having some trouble and the manager was getting involved.  10 minutes later, after no service, we asked that waiter of the table across from us if he could find our waiter.  Turns out, it was him.  Great.  He finally came over and got us started.  
Most of our food was good.  Let me point out what wasn't.  My daughter ordered a side caesar salad with her meal.  When it came, there was no dressing.  Let me clarify.  It wasn't lightly dressed, it had no dressing at all.  Just a bowl of lettuce with a couple of croutons.  My mom ordered the Penne Mediterranean which was completely flavor-less.  My husbands \"surf and terf\" was supposed to come with crispy potatoes, but they were missing from his plate when we were served.  Upon asking the waiter had no clue that they should have been included with the meal.  I will say that when they did arrive, they were our favorite part of our meal.  They forgot to note my birthday so we ordered the Dessert Trio to share and all of those were quite excellent."}
{"text":"Lackluster pasta.  Was expecting great service but that  missed as well.  Not sure how they get the rating they have.  Seems like they are living off the greater chain ratings."}
{"text":"This review is for Brio Tuscan Grille's happy hour, but frankly, considering how poorly happy hour went, I'm never coming back here to try their lunch or dinner. I wanted to try a new happy hour and had heard good things about Brio's food. I took my sister with me to try it out and off we went.

As soon as the first thing happened, I knew I should have just turned back around and tried another restaurant at Town Square. What happened? There were three employees up at the front of the restaurant chatting with each other and when we entered, I said two for happy hour. The guy said happy hour hour was on the patio and turned back to chatting with his fellow employees. I had never been to Brio before and wasn't sure how to get to the patio. Did he want me to go outside to gain access? Through the restaurant? His arm gesture wasn't too exact. So I asked how to get there, trying to subtly convey \"Could you walk us there?\" but nope. The guy just kept arm gesturing and said to sit out on the patio.

Fine. We walk through the restaurant and exit out a door to the patio. We see an empty table and sit down to wait for a waiter. Five minutes or so later, a harried waiter comes by and asks if we were seated by the front. I said no, we were here for happy hour and the guy up front just told us to sit out on the patio. Apparently the real tables were not meant for people during happy hour and that the couches by the fire pit was designated for happy hour. Uh, that was not mentioned, and this time I flat out asked if the waiter could show us this area. He did and I have to say, the area for happy hour sucked. The tables were made out of some flimsy material (some kind of flexible wood? I don't know) and the chairs/couches were terrible for eating on.

The waiter said he didn't know which waiter was going to serve us, but he would find out. I thought that was strange, but didn't think much of it. Again, another thing that should have made me just walk out with my sister and try another restaurant at Town Square instead. He came back and said he was our waiter and the entire time, he was just twitchy, like he didn't want to serve us. I guess it's because we were doing happy hour and by default, happy hour customers' bills won't be as high as someone just having dinner? Which is a stupid reason but one I kept leaning towards the longer we stayed at Brio.

I ordered a vodka martini which reads on the menu \"Sobieski Vodka your way: Dirty or Dry with an Olive or Twist.\" When I ordered it, however, the waiter never gave me an option on how I wanted the martini. When it was served to me, I took a sip and nearly spat it out. It tasted terrible. If it wasn't for the fact that I paid for alcohol, I would have just set it aside, but I finished it because I paid for it and I wasn't going to waste it (but I definitely wasn't happy drinking something I didn't like).

As for happy hour food, we ordered tomato margherita flatbread, brio burger, and crispy cheese ravioli to share between us. The order took awhile to get to us and when it arrived, the burger was cold and the chips on top of it were stale. It was a dish I thought my sister would enjoy the most because it's a burger, but she refused to eat it after one bite. Instead she ate most of the ravioli. The flatbread was okay, just okay, but it's not something I'd want to pay for.

After a disappointing meal and happy hour (sad hour), I asked the waiter as he passed by for the check. I wanted to leave and wash away this disappointment. It took him awhile to hand me my bill and then it took even longer for him to return with my credit card. At that point my disappointment slipped into frustration. Why the heck would a restaurant have a happy hour if they don't want to have a happy hour? Because that's how it felt like. The seating for happy hour was terrible, the staff was terrible, the customer service was certainly terrible, and whether they were short staffed or not, don't act like you don't want me there because I'm going for happy hour and not expensive dinner prices.

Brio Tuscan Grille is one place I will never go to again and, frankly, I will always anti-recommend to people whenever possible. If I could give this place negative stars, I would."}
{"text":"One of my best dining experiences ever!!!!

What could be better than a pleasant and romantic Las Vegas night with your BF in a place with world class service, ambience and food? I am not exaggerating! You heard it - world class! I simply did not expect this at all - it was that great!

From the moment we walked around the beautiful exterior of the restaurant and sat in the waiting area and got to see the gorgeous interior of the restaurant I had a great feeling the experience would be great - but it actually excelled that expectation!

We were seated quickly even though we were told we would wait a bit longer. I could not help but look at the pretty earth toned surroundings while my BF and I chatted away. I had read that the risotto was great here so I looked for it on the menu but could not find it. Well, the waiter overheard that I was looking for the risotto and he said that he would see if they could make it for me anyway. WOW!!!! Double WOW actually, because he came back soon and said that they would make it for me! 

The bread basket here is just great! They kept it coming too! They serve a thin crisp bread which is just divine!

Their iced tea is great and it kept coming too! We never had to ask for anything. The waiter was always looking to make our meal just perfect! You should have seen us drink it too! The hot desert night made us so thirsty!

My shrimp risotto with red pepper was a dream of a dish! The rice was just right and the creamy sauce was ever so tasty! The shrimp were fresh and cooked to perfection! I am not a big fan of any kind of pepper but they integrated the pepper into the dish ever so subtly and created just the right level of spiciness! It is like they read my mind! OMG!!!!

My BF had grilled shrimp, steak and chicken. It was soooo tender and juicy that I just wanted to cry tears of the utmost food ecstasy! It all had a really nice grilled taste to it too!

This place was recommended to us by a good friend of my BF and he really impressed me with his taste on this one! Thanks Pedro!

Parking is no issue since Brio Tuscan Grille is located in a large mall. There is outdoor seating as well. Great for people watching! Let no one fool you - this is no average Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love the tenderloin medallions they are
So yummy with the seared Gorgonzola cheese and topped with a yummy Marsala. Have a bottle of the brunello wine and awesome dinner. :-)"}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Town Square Center this restaurant kept busy Friday night, leaving us to wait thirty minutes. Upon being seated they took our order then we proceeded to draw on the paper table cloth protector for the table cloth under it. 

Their salads are priced perfectly and are rather large, with quite the selection. 4.95. Bread & Butter (tasty). Sparkling water bottled for 2.95, and the entre which we split for 14.95, I wasn't ooo too hungry but the pasta had a very fresh taste to it. Then for the desserts, around 2 bucks for each one of the crme brles, we ordered the the orange flavor which was extremely sweet and tasty along with their lava cake. 

Out waiter was very cool, when he brought the sparkling water to the table he had this fun look on his face, no lime. So I sent it back, he came back 5 minutes later with lime and the water, he ran to CPK to get limes for me, as they had run out 4 hours earlier in the night. 

It's not a quiet romantic place, its very open and the sound is carried throughout the whole place. There is also indoor and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Although the service was somewhat spotty (it was very busy), the food was delicious enough to warrant putting up with it. The Lobster Bisque soup was orgasmic! I also thoroughly enjoyed their Grilled Salmon Salad. I have been to Brio several times in the past and have always found the food to be enjoyable and reasonably priced for the portion and quality. The only downfall is the service; it is generally inconsistent."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their pasta is always al dente and dishes always pleasing to the eye and palette.  I consider this place to be one of my favorites and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"I have been to Brio several times and it is always a very pleasant experience. Good food and good service. I give the restaurant 5 stars, but I give Alex 10 stars. He was incredible and is so customer service oriented! He should definitely be a role model to others around him!"}
{"text":"WOW. SO GOOD. this is a solid 4.5 but i rounded up because of our experience there

this was the place for our last night in vegas dinner and wow was it such a good choice.

location & pricing: the pricing is a bit on the higher side, but its totally worth every penny. the location of it is in the heart of the shopping center or square or whatever its called.

atmosphere: this place inside and out - was so nice. they had nice couches outside, and a plush entryway, and a wonderful setting on the inside. it was a pretty ornate looking interior. dim lights, curtains, rich carpets.

taste: AHHH SOSOSO GOOD. we ordered the brio's bruschetta trio, and since we didn't know what to order, we asked our waiter for recommendations. what great recommendations that STEVE gave us. we got the bistecca alla fiorentina, artichoke encrusted beef medallions, pasta brio, and the mushroom ravioli al forno. it was soooo delicious. perfect seasoning, perfect spice & flavor. oh and the complimentary bread!! we had crispy and soft bread. 

so we did order the brio's bruschetta trio, but we didn't actually get to try it - steve totally forgot about it and cancelled the bruschetta and offered us the dolchino sampler: peach cobbler, mocha mousse?, creme brulee, cheesecake with a raspberry sauce, applebread, milk chocolate cake with caramel, and tiramisu. the only bad thing is that it was a little \"too much of a good thing\" scenario. while it was so decadent and wonderful, it was a little too rich to finish everything even amongst the four of us (one guy and three girls)

service: STEVE. impeccable. we even got his card - he works everyday except sunday (to watch football), and when we are back (and WE WILL!) we're going to make sure in hell that we sit at steve's table."}
{"text":"I had a reservation this afternoon for two. We arrived and they did not have a patio table available for us so we opted to wait at the bar. Approximately thirty minutes went by and we were seated.  As we sat there, we noticed three servers greet the table next to us. Meanwhile, not one server approached us. After about ten minutes of waiting, we decided to just leave and have brunch elsewhere. We were excited to try a new place for brunch, but didn't get the opportunity and we won't be back. There are way to many restaurants in this town with better service."}
{"text":"Great food great service.  Best place to go for dinner in Gilbert.  One of our favorite places to go.  The service is great, the food is the best we can find.  Why pay more when they have a great menu and the atmosphere is great.   We go here once a month since they have been open. We have never been disappointed.  We have been to both San Tan and Scottsdale.  Both of them are great places to go."}
{"text":"Your review helps others learn about great local businesses.

Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.
This place is amazing Dinner last night could not have been bettering. The Salmon is to die for and I loved the flat bread as an appetizer. Not to filling.the waitress was a sweetheart wished I would have gotten her name. Left feeling very happy. Fresh food"}
{"text":"Anyone in the area need to go to Brio! The service, food, and energy is amazing. Eveything I have tried on the menu leaves me wanting more.  I will DEFINITELY be back with a client (or 10) to celebrate closing escrow!"}
{"text":"Great wine list , great food .loved the Pasta. Atmosphere was fun and upbeat. Would love to go back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"What I like about Olive Garden and Carrabba's is they know who they are.  They're chain restaurants that give you an OK meal at an average price.
  
Brio is a chain that tries to be a classy local Italian restaurant but they don't live up to that. Don't get me wrong, the food is OK, the decor is beautiful and the restaurant is huge (thus taking away from the classy local restaurant feel).

I started with the calamari which was a bit soggy and came with two sauces that were spooned over about half of the serving. What if I didn't like the sauces? Ask for the sauce on the side.

For my main course I had what was advertised as Shrimp and Lobster Linguine.  A few problems with this dish.  The linguine was a bit overcooked and the lobster turned out to be scallops.  When I asked about the lack of lobster I was politely told that there was an error on the menu. Someone couldn't have told me that when I ordered?  Wasn't I supposed to notice?  

The service was very good.  As the restaurant filled up it got hard to hear across the table. Again, the classy local restaurant atmosphere they try to project ruined.  They do have an enclosed patio area that would be much quieter but I think they like to hold those tables for private parties and large groups.  Wouldn't hurt to ask though."}
{"text":"When we first walked in, I wasn't sure if Brio would only be all decoration and average tasting food, which is what many restaurants seem to be these days.   My husband and 7-year old daughter were out shopping at Town Square, and wanted to grab some lunch.  We stumbled upon Brio and weren't sure if we were dressed properly (underdressed) but were treated as if we were first-class diners from start to finish. 

To cut to the chase, from the moment we walked in until the second we left we were treated with the best customer service we've experienced in a restaurant in ages.  Our server (Tammy) was superbly kind, helpful, expedient and professional.  Our drinks came out in a flash, as did everything else.  The food was absolutely D-I-V-I-N-E.  We had the house margaritas (delish!), the chopped  salad (amazing), the Lobster Bisque (to die for!) and for our entrees, the petite filet \"Tournedos di Manzo\" the \"Mushroom Ravioli al Forno\", and for our daughter, the kids' lasagne.  My daughter especially liked the kids' fruit smoothie (by far the best smoothie, I've ever tasted), but wasn't too crazy about the lasagne.  I think it was due to the Italian sausage in it... she's not too crazy about Italian sausage. 
What stuck out: the beautiful decor, the very friendly and very attentive serving staff, the \"dough-ball\" given to us to play with while we waited (which, we were told, could be baked before we left) and the extremely unique and tasteful food.
All-in-all, a wonderful dining experience, and we will absolutely return!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out per the mountain of good reviews.  Had excellent food and the service from Geoff was AWESOME!
Per other Yelper reviews, we got the Bruschetta Quartro!  Totally recommend! I tried the lobster pasta and my husband got the pork.  Both excellent.
The only reason I gave 4 starts was because we ordered salads and never got them.  However Geoff was awesome and took the salads off our bill and provided us a free dessert:)"}
{"text":"4 stars? Yes, 4 stars...3 seems too low.  Ideally 3.5 is what I would rate it.  A few notches above Olive Garden, Macaroni Grill, and even Maggiano's. While I don't usually like to eat at \"chain\" restaurants, this has been my saving grace for informal lunch meetings, dinners with unadventurous eaters, and satisfying a group of people with various dietary preferences (low carb, low fat, gluten free, vegetarian).  

I highly recommend making reservations for the evening when you have a party of 6 or more, but for lunch I usually have to wait 10-15 minutes.  They give you a pager and you have the freedom to occupy your wait time with shopping in nearby stores.  Once inside, the setting is a pleasing \"Tuscan\" style and the energy/noise level is bustling, but usually I like to sit outside because I usually have my nicely behaved dogs with me. They require I tie my dogs to the outside of the restaurant fence and sit at a nearby table,but I have seen dogs sit on their laps with their owners.  This discrepancy kind of bothers me, because my dogs are well behaved, but like to sit at our feet...many don't notice them but if they do it is because they are cute and well behaved.

Usually I order a flatbread and bruschetta for the table as an appetizer. I usually order the steak salad for lunch, which is phenominal, especially since most places end up making the meat well done or not using a tender meat. The pasta is decent here, at least I never heard my guests complain and usually give raves.   The portions are generous for the price, and usually lasting me two meals.  I have had the steak and vegetables for dinner, which was prepared and cooked nicely. Service is always polite, but sometimes a little slow when it is busy. Again the food is no culinary feat, but it is solid and unoffensive.  While not unique, no one is going to complain and your guests will definitely think it is solid food and come out satisfied and full.  

Again a great place where everyone can find something they like and enjoy themselves in a casual, relaxed Italian style.

One other comment, I think they have done a great job with their wine menu. By the glass, plenty of unique and affordable wines covering a range of varietals both whites and reds, but also many familiar, easy drinking wines.  Further, many \"gem\" bottle that are well priced...about 175% markup rather than the 200%+ markups...that can mean atleast $10 -20 savings per bottle."}
{"text":"Our friends suggested Brio for dinner one night.  I've had it bookmarked since I've started yelping so of course I wanted to go!

The dining area is elegant.  I loved the decor.  You can dine outside but we chose inside.  Service here was impeccable.  Our waitress was outstanding.  She gave us great suggestions for our meal.  

We started off sharing the spinach dip.  Creamy and full of flavor.  I'd definitely order this again.  For my entree I ordered the grilled salmon fresca. This had perfectly grilled asparagus, sweet potatoes, spinach and red peppers topped with the grilled salmon.  I loved the vegetables.  The salmon was a little over cooked but not bad overall.  Dessert? Of course! They offer little dessert shooters.  I tried the chocolate caramel cake shooter.  Oh yeah.... I'd have that again.  Our friends ordered the dessert sampler including creme brûlée, bread pudding and cheesecake.  Absolutely delicious! 

I believe Brio is one of the better choices in the Town Square area.  I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went to Brio for lunch. I was not very impressed with the meal, especially after seeing the check. The interior is nice and the waiter was great, but the food is honestly subpar."}
{"text":"I love walking into this place & you automatically feel better. The aromas make you extra hungry, the dark lighting is just right & the food is always great. 
I haven't had anything that I didn't enjoy & whenever I bring people over who are first timers they become instant fans. I also need to mention that they have a fantastic happy hour even though I didn't participate in this particular visit. Some of my favorite items are; the balsamic strawberry salad, the lobster bisque & the margherita flat bread. 
The service has also been great on every visit so I highly recommend this place. Outdoor dining is also a must on nice days or evenings."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem in Town Square! Delightful food and atmosphere with excellent service! Enjoyed immensely!"}
{"text":"It's tough to find a restaurant that is both classy and casual, that works equally well for a nice dinner for two or for a family occasion. 

Brio makes that happen and does so in an excellent way.

The menu has creative versions of Italian favorites and plenty of more traditional items, and they are very flexible with special requests. They also have a good sized kid's menu as well. 

The service is extremely courteous and the servers work together to take care of the greeting, beverages, ordering and food delivery.

This particular Brio does all of the above especially well! I've been to this one twice and have no doubt I'll be back there again soon."}
{"text":"I'm absolutely a fan. I have never been to Brio and had to plan last minute get together. They really do a great job at this place. The decor is beautiful and the service was above and beyond. As I mentioned earlier, I had a last minute event. I made my reservation for Sunday Brunch during Thanksgiving weekend. It was part of wedding festivities. They were so nice to let me in a bit early to have the table set so that all of my guests would feel like guests. This is what we ordered. 

Appetizers: 
Fried calamari and flatbread BBQ chicken pizza 

Entrees (everyone was pleased) 
Penne w/Vodka sauce, carbonara, fettuccine rustica, paninis, risotto and some brunch items 

Coffee service: 
Cappuccino and coffee for dessert. 

Gluten Free: 
As I was ordering, I mentioned no croutons with my salad ..can't have gluten. Server asked if I had an allergy, I said yes. They made all the adjustments to accommodate my dietary restrictions. There is a whole protocol that goes into effect to limit cross contamination. Awesome. I'm not as sensitive, but those with allergies should feel confident that they have a knowledgeable staff. I do have to mention that initially I asked the hostess and she said no they do not have GF options/choices. They clearly do. So happy that my waiter(s) and kitchen are informed about food allergies. Our waiters were Ryan and Dino."}
{"text":"I love Brio! They have one of the best Happy Hours in town. Almost everything on that menu is so delicious. The shrimp eggplant, spinach and artichoke dip, burger and caprese salad are my favs! The only reason I can't give them five stars is because the service is not always that great."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for the first time for our anniversary, and I was definitely impressed. Coming from New York, I've always been really picky about Italian food. But Brio nailed it! I got the pasta with vodka sauce, and I couldn't get enough of it. For dessert we got a creme brûlée, which was also delicious, and our drinks were great as well. I wish we still had a Brio in Tucson! Will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"We've had positive experiences here previously, but left before placing an order Friday night...it took 10 minutes before the waitress arrived, and after taking our drink order, she brought bread but no drinks. There were no set-ups or appetizer plates. When the drinks arrived another 10 minutes later, one guest's drink was not there, and still no tableware.  It's not an inexpensive place, and this simply didn't bode well. We went for a nice walk and had a good dinner elsewhere...that's the beauty of Town Square, I suppose!"}
{"text":"We had a school function and they donated all of the food for free.  The food was delicious.  Pasta with chicken, mushrooms, and a full course salad.   I will eat there not just for the food, but for a business that donates to the community."}
{"text":"Thanks Rhett! Walked in for an early dinner with my parents after a long but successful afternoon at the Apple store across the street. This place is huge and has cool architecture inside. They took care of us right away and everything came out pretty quick because they weren't too busy yet. 

Kale Caesar was really good. Added some olive oil and extra dressing which I usually do at most restaurants. Thanks again Rhett."}
{"text":"Underwhelming is a good word for this place. I liked our sweet waitress, and the atmosphere is nice. I can cook better food in my kitchen though, and faster. Took nearly 30 minutes to get our appetizer out to us (on a Sunday afternoon). How long do you need to slice tomato and mozzarella and drizzle it with balsamic for a caprese? Took another 30 minutes to get the lunches out to us.

I'm not quite sure what kind of oil they use to cook the chicken, but the aftertaste was disgusting and it upset my stomach to (what seemed like) no end. Their bolognese sauce was boring. The chicken was dry and was too greasy to be \"baked\". Their steamed veggies were actually overcooked and soggy.

I didn't bother trying their desserts. Got out of there quick."}
{"text":"Very disappointed for the price they charge I was given a dirty torn menu? I asked the waiter for a clean one and he gave me a blank look! When you go order your drink than wait 10 minutes to order your entree because they will serve it right on top of your app ..than I wasn't finished eating but the waiter kept asking me if I was? Huh.. really doesn't management teach them if the fork has food on it leave it alone. The food is average and not consistent."}
{"text":"My recent trip to Tuscany, Italy has me wanting to try all different types of Italian fare.  Brio was a great treat - I actually like this place better than some of the restaurants we went to in Italy.  Not that the Italian food in Italy didn't taste good, but the bold flavors at Brio were more pleasing to my palette.

Large, open, tastefully decorated, the mood was set for relaxation.  Went there with 4 of my team members and this was all our first visit.  The only down was that the acoustics and ambient noise didn't make for the best conversation but as long as your voice was strong, you were good.

Service was good and staff was pleasant and orders came out accurately (and quickly).

The Caprese Bruchetta rocked.  Lots of flavor and great texture.  The sweet balsamic was the perfect addition.

The Caprese Ravioli was equally as good.  Lots of fresh baby tomatoes to season the dish.  Large pieces of pasta and hearty enough to make a meal.

I had the Sweet Potato and Grilled Chicken Risotto.  DELICIOUS.  I wasn't sure what to expect as it seemed like an odd combination but they pulled it off nicely.  Add in some fresh asparagus and i was very satisfied with the meal.

At the table was also salmon, tomato bisque, and the lasagna.  All said they enjoyed their meals.

We had everything except alcohol and we were out of there for around $150.

Definitely will go here again."}
{"text":"Average. This is the only word required to describe Brio Tuscan Grille, if you're looking to truly fine dine with some friends and family then I do NOT recommended Brio Tuscan Grille. The service here is slow and choppy, and quite rushed at times. The waiter failed to juggle a mere three families. Despite the horrific service I must say, the food was not nearly as bad. I chose the Bolognese Lasagna and was quite pleased with the final result. In conclusion, Brio Tuscan Grille is quite average and you can DEFINETELY find a better place to dine with family.

{"text":"Loved it Great Italian food great service my new favorite pasta place. Can't wait to try more"}
{"text":"Meh. I'm really not sure why I asked for my leftovers. The food was not good. The risotto was undercooked and the lasagna tasted like it had American cheese in it. The lobster bisque was too thick and the bar tender must have forgotten to put the alcohol in our drinks. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Portobello Mushrooms stuffed ravioli  heavenly
Spicy shrimp and eggplant         Wonderful 
Service fantastic"}
{"text":"Service was atrocious when we visited. Shame too. Because we generally loved Brio when we lived in Denver. Perhaps the customer service standards are different in CO from AZ."}
{"text":"Great place, good atmosphere.  Our server had perfect timing and didn't push us to leave after we finished.  I had the eggs Benedict (they call it something slightly different).  The flavor was delicious-best eggs benny I have had!  The potatoes were seasoned very well-again best I think I have had as a standard potato side and the asparagus was thin but tender.  We then had the chocolate dessert and oh my!  The creamy center, not too rich, not too sugary.  Can't say it was like lava cake, center was thicker but I liked it better! I would certainly come again!

I did not pick up the check but my eggs benny was a good portion for me (granted I am small BUT I can eat) and it was $10.95."}
{"text":"Arrived Thursday Dec, 22, 2011 without reservations at 6:45pm, which may be a bit early for this place. The bar was packed, the dining room had lots of empty but reserved tables.

We got decent service, about 10 minutes till our salads arrived and 32 minutes until our meals arrived. 

Easy parking in the garage across the street.

I would go back anytime, it was a good meal and good service."}
{"text":"I love going to Town Square. The service is phenomenal and the staff is so friendly at Brio. The atmosphere is nice but the prices are a little expensive. I had the chicken parm and it was not very good. The sauce with angel hair pasta was fantastic. I would recommend this place but don't get the chicken parm. With the bread they give frozen butter. Doesn't spread on the bread at all. They should serve olive oil with the bread."}
{"text":"In the past I came to dinner. This time I came here for lunch at 1130 AM. The first time I've ever seen the place totally empty. I needed to get out relatively fast. My server I should make that with the place is this empty, there would be no problem getting the food in a hurry. She did not lie. . I ordered the barbecue chicken pizza from the appetizer menu . In other restaurants when I order pizza there is at least a 15 to 20 minute wait before this pizza is ready. The pizza was on my table within 10 minutes. And it was delicious. The crust was sweet and soft ( a little chewy, just the way I like it). The pizza itself was not overwhelmed with the barbecue chicken sauce flavor. There was an abundance fresh greens that decorated the top of the pizza. A lunch for one for under $10 before the tip. Such a good deal!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Amazing food!! The shrimp with eggplant is exswiset!!!! Amazing atmosphere! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR TUSCAN TASTER MENU $2.95?!?!!? My fave eat in Vegas by far!!!!! Brio Tuscan Grille is at the heart of Town Square, and since it's a ways off The Strip, it's not bustling with tourists. Sitting outside at the bar on a warm Spring afternoon...=) SO PEACEFUL! 

BEEF CARPACCIO - This one is my favorite! The meat is sliced super super thin and goes so well with the mustard aioli and field greens. 

SLICED STEAK BRUSCHETTA - This one is a close runner up. Some bites you may find the gorgonzola to be overpowering. I think the steak and bruschetta could've done without the cheese. Nevertheless, YUM! 

BRIO BURGER - Okay, but kind of dry and plain. Not a fan of the chips it comes with either. Sliced into fours for sharing!

RAVIOLI CAPRESE - Three giant raviolis. Super cheesy and tastes like it was fried. So unless you douse each bite with tomato sauce, it gets dry.

SHRIMPTINI - I was pleasantly surprised with this! The're very generous with the shrimp! Super cute presentation and uber refreshing.

I looked over at the party of 2 sitting right next to us...turns out they ordered the exact same 5 dishes. Must be a good sign! Our waiter also recommended the SPICY SHRIMP AND EGGPLANT, but we didn't have enough stomach room. 

Where else can you stuff 2 people with such quality food for less than $20, tax and tip included?! I want to tell all my friends, but at the same time, I want to keep this place all to myself ;)"}
{"text":"This is a place I visit frequently. The lack of check ins is a reflection of my phone dying or me leaving it in the car -_- i prefers the Tivoli Village location because its prettier and less crowded - oh! and less kids :D 

There is always plenty of parking in the garage either so you can avoid the hot hot sun or the cold of winter. When you walk into the restaurant, the hostess is always there with a smile and walking you to your table immediately. 

I really like the waiters here, because you can tell they're a team and they're always looking out for each other. Whenever it does get kind of busy, and our waiter is running around, another waiter from another section will come help us or tend to our needs. They always saying they're helping each other out, which is nice to see. At the other location in Town Square, other waiters are always ignoring us unless we're their table. 

The lobster bisque is really good and not too fishy tasting. I personally like penne pasta with vodka sauce. They don't have it on the menu though - they have another type of noodle with cheese in it with the vodka sauce. I always ask for the penne vodka though, and they are always more than willing to accomodate and ask the chef for me. I always add shrimp too! Makes me feel like someone important because theyre doing something off the menu for me haha 

My boyfriend has gotten a combination of some type of steak, lambchops, and several pastas, and they are always good!!

We always OD on bread so if youre hungry, you should ask for no bread...because once its on your table, its hard to ignore it!"}
{"text":"Great value for the price, nice ambience clean place and service is excellent. The Mgr Ashley super nice very welcoming and accomodating."}
{"text":"Lasagna Bolognese was a good dish. Meaty. Shrimp and lobster fettucine was tasty as well. Nice restaurant inside, good ambiance. I will return.  The cheesecake mascarpone was excellent!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Just awful. Granted, it was his first day. But we asked for water and iced tea and waited over 25 minutes. Our kids got their food before their drinks. The server seemed baffled by our request, after he left us alone for 15 minutes without speaking to us - no drinks, no bread, didn't take our entree order - nothing. Then he did bring our iced tea - after we asked three times - with no lemon, no straws. Just clueless! I asked for a manager and requested a new server, who is doing better but we shouldn't have to get a manager's assistance to get drinks. The manager has been very gracious. As for the food? I have no idea because now it's been almost 40 minutes and I still haven't gotten my appetizer salad. Just ... So disappointed. Maybe starting someone new on the Saturday of a holiday weekend isn't the best idea. Just a thought.

Update: We never got our appetizer salads. Frankly, I don't think the server ever submitted our order. Then my brother's order of stuffed pasta with vodka sauce  came out cold. We had to ask three times for olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The food was good, especially the bread, but I couldn't get over the poor service, even after TWO managers got involved. Ultimately we were comped our meal, partly so I would \"stop yelling.\" (My voice was raised but I didn't think I was yelling.) The sous chef was very nice. And we did leave a tip for the full cost of the meal. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Brio Brio Brio.... I have gone here a ton of times.  So this is a general review of multiple experiences.

1. Good food, lets get things straight I keep going back because of the food location and people watching, the service is at best mediocre and at worst it just plain sucks.

Flatbread - quite good
Fish specials - Good (usually go for this at lunch)
Chicken under a brick - bad should be left under the brick and kicked to the curb
Pizza - good (if you like thin crust stuff, i prefer just going to the flatbreads though)
Lamb - I like pink lamb I have had to send back as ultra rare lamb is not to my taste, beef yes lamb ultra rare no
Deserts are good I link the sampler (see service below)

i like the ambiance of this place for sitting outside and people watching, there arent enough decent al fresco dining places in vegas (because it gets hot) however it is too big.  Been there a lot and have never been remembered because i rarely have seen the same server twice.

Wait staff seems to be overworked and under-crewed so I never take it out on my servers (tip wise), however I have had to complain about wait times and am usually rewarded with free desert to the table which i usually get the sampler which is quite tasty and varied the apple crumble is very good.

Price to food quality is a very good ratio. Overall it is a decent restaurant,  if you are tight on time, it would be  a no go.  However for extended lunches (booze helps deal with longer wait times) it is a go to place.  Just if the service is slow dont be scared to notify people you are waiting and furthermore dont hesitate to take it out on the manager and not the overworked servers who are really trying their best with what looks like understaffing decisions.

Overall a 3 star would be 4 if their service gets a revamp."}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend to this restaurant for her birthday and she was pleasantly surprised. The eggplant shrimp appetizer is fantastic. The service was exemplary. Not too crowded on a Sunday afternoon. The entrees were good and value seemed in line with food quality. Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Italian food with a capital D for DELICIOUS! 
Our first time at Brio and our lunch at this establishment is a definite amazement. The food is very hearty and flavorful, not to mention the great customer service that Jen has provided us. She was very patient with us and she made us feel very at ease and welcomed. 
The two salads that we ordered, Kale Cesar Salad and Steak salad are both excellent! The chef pulled out all the stops with the salads alone. 
The Pasta Alfredo is one of the tastiest that I've had and I am an Alfredo pasta girl. I recommend this Alfredo to everyone! Go and enjoy it. 
The ambiance of Brio is very intimate and it's pretty casual. There was a lot of Christmas parties happening when we ate there today which made the place have a festive vibe. 
Two thumbs up to Brio and I recommend this place to everyone to try out."}
{"text":"So glad we picked Brio Tuscan Grille for our Valentines dinner.  Great Location at Scottsdale Quarter.  We had reservations so only waited 10 minutes.  Our server, Chelsea was great! Quick, attentive, but not annoying.  Very knowledgeable about the menu and had great suggestions.  Free appetizer with yelp. We had bruschetta and it was good.  I ordered off the light menu and had pasta pesto and I loved it.  It was light but very flavorful.  My date had the Lasagna and said it was one of the best he ever had.  Then we had to split the chocolate lava cake for desert.  SO Good!  First five star for me, even though it is a chain, they had it all on this night.. Good service, atmosphere, great server, food and price."}
{"text":"Yet another Italian restaurant in Ohio.  Don't get me wrong.  Italian food is ok.  It's just not the be all and end all food that most people in Ohio think it is.  This place is definitely not worth the hour-long wait on a Saturday evening.  And we arrived at 6 o'clock!  Chris the bartender was freaking hilarious though.  Kind of looks like Chris Elliott too.  You can tell this dude loves his job and messing with people.  If the place is too busy just sit at the bar.  You'll have a much better time.  They have $2.99 happy hour specials that might be worth checking out.  The tables are far too close together.  Some retarded baby almost hit me with their bottle.  Wasn't too impressed with my meal or salad but the sour dough bread rocked.  This place might be worth another look when it's not so freaking busy."}
{"text":"With the reviews I've read, I really wish we could have gotten to the food. 

As it is, while we were given water and (yes, tasty) bread initially after giving our orders, we sat at our table for two hours without being served our food. 

We even asked to speak with the manager, but apparently (after thirty minutes of waiting) he was far too busy to discuss matters with a disgruntled customer. 

Ultimately, two hours, one glass of water and two pieces of bread later, our party walked out."}
{"text":"This is based on wait time. Date night was ruined. We came in around 6pm, and shortly ordered. We were told that one of the items we had ordered would come out in like 45-50 minutes. We didn't expect all our meal to come in that same time frame. None of the staff seemed to notice. I literally had to grab a random staff member to ask for the check, and I could see her trying to figure out where the waitress was. Then she asked if we were in a hurry, and I was like we have been here almost 2 hours. Never going back. She said could you please wait while we get you a coupon for next time. Nope, we split, there won't be a next time. 

On a positive note the water there is really good. Definitely not from the tap. The food was good too, or maybe it was because I was forced to fast prior to getting it."}
{"text":"Pasta alla vodka,
and their spicy pannini a must.

Love the decor, can be loud."}
{"text":"My friend ordered a meal that we did not know had garlic in the sauce (she's allergic) and they took back and remade the plate without hesitation. Very friendly staff, comfortable environment, food was delicious, and I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"No need to fully gorge on their menu... the flatbreads are excellent enough if are in for a light lunch with a glass of wine. Conducive enough for a group of friends who are more attuned to catching up than gorging.... best thing is they don't rush you to eat your food."}
{"text":"So the management team from Bri Tuscan Grill contacted me after my review. The manager  listened to what I had to say and was truly concerned that it wasn't the best experience. Which I appreciated. They asked that I try the restaurant again and give them the opportunity to show me their great service and gave me a gift card. I appreciated the call and will definitely give the restaurant another chance."}
{"text":"Some people do not know what is good.  Brio is good.  Their food and service is beyond good.
There are so many things on the menu from appitizers to deserts that it would take me forever to write a review on the food.  All I can tell you is that you are in for a treat at Brio"}
{"text":"my family and i went here to celebrate my brothers wedding. although we had a big party. first off they forgot our side of the tables drink orders. we didnt have enough waters on our table so we had to share. i waited 30 minutes for our side of the tables drink orders to be taken after telling a gentleman they forgot instead of taking our order he said ill send ur waiter. i asked for a refil 3 times twice to one lady and 1 to a gentleman no one came 1 1/2 hours go by and im still waiting my brother finally got pist and had to get up and get me a refil from the manager. then they wanted to come as ask if everything is ok at that point i had to keep my mouth shut because i was so irritated and disappointed in the customer service there. i would have probably got kicked out and i didn't want to ruine the reason why we were all celebrating. my tia never got the soup she ordered. when our food came it was cold like it was sitting there forever before they brought it out. the only person on point was the bread guy. he didn't fail us. other then that it was a horrible experience and we will never go back. the thing is there wasn't only one person working our table there was 3 and still all these mess ups i don't understand how that even happens."}
{"text":"The food here was good. I had the pork chops and vegetables. The chops were well done. My date had the lamb, which was excellent according to her. The noise level was a bit too much for an effective conversation. The restaurant is lovely but needs to be a more conversation-friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful atmosphere and fantastic service. The Chef's appetizer special - bruschetta with pinot noir caramelized onions - was incredible. And the key lime shooter desert just the right amount as well as final touch to a wonder meal. The outdoor seating with fire pit adds to the enjoyable experience. Pricing was as indicated - $$, a great value and well worth every penny. I definitely would come back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"The quality is good but the menu is tired and needs to be updated. I don't think I have a favorite item, I wish they had a traditional chicken parm but they don't. The thing I order the most is pasta ala vodka but there's a finite number of times a person can order the same thing before it's terrible."}
{"text":"Celebrating our 2 year anniversary at the Brio.  Love this place by far the service here is excellent.  Not to mention the food is amazing.  I highly recommend this restaurant food and drink are amazing."}
{"text":"We were in town square yesterday, and I and the family got hungry after a fun afternoon at the playground so we decided to have dinner at Brio. I have been wanting to try this place out, and considering it was our cheat day, I was really excited to have some good pasta. We ordered the caesar salad, lobster bisque, lasagna, the campanelle carbonara, and the tiramisu and some fresh fruit for dessert. The Caesar was okay, lobster bisque was mediocre at best (very generic tasting), my son liked the lasagna, but the carbonara was just waaaayyy too salty. I thought at first that the Parmesan made it salty, but even the pasta in the very bottom of the dish was salty. I literally couldn't eat more than a quarter of the dish because of it. The tiramisu was okay, at least it washed away the saltiness from the pasta dish. I was so bummed because I've been looking forward to coming here, and actually having some good pasta, and just regretted my decision of choosing brio over yard house or bone fish grill. I know this is only our first visit, but I am sort of hesitant to come back here again since they messed up something that was supposed to be a staple of theirs. On the bright side, our server was nice and on top of things so that adds another star to my review."}
{"text":"I wish I could have addressed this with the wait staff, but I will in a hurry. I ordered sweet potato risotto and a wedge salad. the risotto was over cooked and under seasoned. this was my first experience at Brio, so I'm willing to give them another chance, but something this simple shouldn't have been messed up."}
{"text":"First time visit we had a late night meal prior going to the movies. Welcomed with a smile and welcoming words by every employee we encountered.  Took our order promptly with out rushing us.  Prompt on the drinks and bread.  Very friendly and attentive waitress with out being over bearing/pushy. Loved her smile and attitude. Food was enjoyed and shared by all of us.  The pasta alla penne was very good. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"The food was just ok. I had the chicken limone and the lobster bisque soup and two orders of the white peach sangria of which the second one tasted totally different than the first. I would have said something but the waitress was nowhere to be found. The entree portions are huge! I just wish the food tasted better. So if you're looking to stuff with your face with mediocre Italian food and wanted to be treated by a neglectful wait staff, you're definitely at the right place!"}
{"text":"The fried calamari was as cold as the reception by our surly waitress, and the chopped Greek salad was as depressing as the actual Greek economy. If this place produced food as good as the decor I would return but it is not to be. 
The employee eating next to us received far better and friendly service, and given his ample girth, that is something he's taken advantage many times. This place only pretends to be a restaurant."}
{"text":"It was a good meal & a good atmosphere. I had the shrimp-lobster crepes & my wife had the chicken & avocado omelet.  The 2 crepes had two asparagus spears each, plenty of bay shrimp, some lobster, scrambled eggs inside & covered with hollandaise  sauce.  The potatoes were great & the fruit- pineapple & strawberrys tasted fresh.  The omelet also had the fruit dish.  The presentation of both dishes was great.  Preceeding the above was hot sourdough bread which was delicious.
The service was good.  Even though we arrived in the middle of the Sunday brunch hour we were seated immediately.  There was available seating inside and outside. The server was attentive without being intrusive.  The server wrote down our orders rather than remembering them (brownie points for that).
 The house chardonney was good & a new glass of ice tea was delivered rather than refilling the existing glass (brownie points for that).
We could see the bar area and the decore was very inviting as was the rest of the establishment.  Table cloths & cloth napkins on the table give the dining experience a touch of class.
Suggestion for the Grille: The manager should visit tables to inquire as to satisfaction. It is commonplace for most quality restaurants.  We would have given him/her positive comments, of course.
Overall, we recommend Brio."}
{"text":"The food was great.  Unfortunately service was very slow.  The manager acknowledged the problem and apologized.  We will try this restaurant again in the future."}
{"text":"Arrival: Five or six girls dressed in black, waiting around doing a whole lot of nothing.  Chatting among themselves.  No personality.  It was nice, I felt like I was in a fancy, posh restaurant!

Our Seat:  They must have had about 15-20 extra waiters and staff sort of loitering around the restaurant.  It was super awkward.  Here's what is more awkward: having those waiters hovering over your table, waiting for their orders from the cafeteria (or was it a kitchen?), talking about clubs, their nights, conquests and misc. other adventures.

Appetizers:  Very good.  Let's say B+.  Stuffed peppers.  Best part of the meal.

Entrees:  This was where it just got bad.  Two terrible entrees.  Mezza Chicken Limone tasted like I was eating straight egg.  Zero flavor unless you ate a moutful of salt and capers.

Do yourself a favor, if you want a chain Italian restaurant in Las Vegas, head on over to the Macaroni Grill and save yourself some time and money.  (Yes, it was bad enough for me to recommend Macaroni Grill)"}
{"text":"Awful food, awful service...my husband and I top this as one of our worst dining experiences.  A tv dinner has more flavor than this so called \"Italian\" cuisine."}
{"text":"The short and sweet of it is that this a dime a dozen restaurant featuring lofty pricing with ever so slightly above average quality/tasting Italian food. 

It is basically like so many other similarly marketed  'upscale' Italian restaurants I have been to.  

I did like the fresh warm loaf of bread served at the beginning of the meal along with the seasoned toasted pita crisp bread pieces. 

The caesar salad was OK, as it really should have been.  My chicken pasta meal was also passable, but it just didn't blow me away as I had hoped it would.   The rest of my family did not voice any notable displeasure with their meal choices, so all is well in that situation. 

The atmosphere in the restaurant was mellow enough,  even though the noise level was a bit elevated due to the full customer capacity at the time.  I also thought it was decorated tastefully.  The tables were placed far enough apart to allow for a pleasant and private enough dining experience.  

I was only in town to visit some family, so it is fair to assume that it is assured I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went last nite for happy hour.    Weds is also $5 martini nite evidently!   I had the Raspberitini and the Lemon/Basil tini.    Both were excellent!  Our server Brie was happy to bring us samples of the HH wines ...... but my friend didn't care much for them and opted for a $9 glass of blended red from Australia..... at the recommendation of another server.  
We ordered 4 appetizers of the HH menu ...caprese salad .... very good.     Margarita Flatbread ..... excellent.   Beef Carpaccio ..... tasty and beautifully presented.    And the black peppered shrimp  .... we asked for the spicy sauce on the side, which we got.   And we asked to hold the black pepper, and just bring the peppermill ..... as I don't like black pepper or spicy!
Here's where they failed!   The batter/breading mix already has the pepper mixed in!   And it's on both the eggplant base AND the shrimp!!   If only the kitchen had informed Brie of that!
Well she did her best and offered to order something different for us and had it taken of the check.   We ordered the garlic/artichoke/cheese dip instead and it was great.
I believe Brie has only been there a couple of weeks.... she did a wonderful job!"}
{"text":"One of the best Tuscan restaurants I've ever been to! Way better than anything on the strip for the price!! My boyfriend and I went to Vegas for the week and decided to try it and we loved it! The ambiance is beautiful and they text you when your table is ready! The servers were really sweet and helpful. I had the tomato bisque soup and it was AMAZING! Go here!"}
{"text":"Once again, Brio was a great dining experience. We dined on steak salad, carpaccio and succulent lobster risotto. Delicious sangria and black raspberry martinis were exceptional. Of course, our server, Julio, made the night even more special. His professionalism and attention rate him at the top in people skills, making this dining experience an epicurean delight in a most comfortable and relaxed ambiance. Thank you also to Jesse, manager extraordinaire, for his most personable approach and care. Happy hour is very special!! Dinners are divine! Sunday Brunch is a must!! Experienced them al!! Enjoy Brio!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had another delicious dinner, at Happy Hour, at Brio's in Town Square in Las Vegas.
The professionalism of the staff namely, Brian (manager), Alyssa and Mike (bartenders), is beyond compare.  Besides delicious dishes, such as beef carpaccio and spicy shrimp and eggplant in a delicious spicy sauce, we also feasted on crispy shrimp served on a delicious bed of greens.  The Brio burger is still a must have order, for sure.  I must say that it is definitely worth your time, and you owe it to your tastebuds, to enjoy The Brio Restaurant and all it has to offer.

{"text":"I went for dinner Thursday night and all I can say is wow, food was amazing and service was awesome, I had white sangria and sangria rosa I believe was the name of it, my date ordered the lobster bisque and the calamari and it was to die for  
For our entrees he got the lasagna and I got the balsamic short ribs with creamy polenta on the bottom... the whole meal was superb. Then to top it off, our awesome waitress suggested dessert so we got the chocolate cake with vanilla gelato  it was the end to a very good dinner. Three things will draw me right back
1 - the food is awesome
2 - the restaurant is beautiful 
3 - service was excellent (I forgot the name of our waitress but she was super nice and attentive)"}
{"text":"Went for the second time yesterday and beat the weekend dinner rush at 5:30. Our experience was simply average this time. As always, the atmosphere is nice, clean and has soft flowing fabric on the ceiling that makes me feel like I am about to see a Cirque du Soleil show. Our server seemed very unhappy and didn't smile until he brought us the check and knew his tip was on the line. He must have been having a crummy day. It happens. Our Caesar kale salad and lobster bisque were fantastic but our entrees were below average. Wine taste is subjective but we were not fans of our choices (not their fault)and almost $8+ per glass is steep when they don't even fill the glass halfway. 

I ordered the risotto lobster special and my stepmom the salmon and asparagus dish. Stepmom liked hers far more than I liked mine. The salmon was a bit overcooked and the sweet potatoes overly salty but she liked the overall taste and the asparagus were grilled and perfectly cooked. The risotto was over cooked, mushy and soupy, instead of a bit sticky as it should have been. The lobster was a good addition but I could have done without the pre-frozen, chewy shrimp and wanted more vegetables. There were literally three 1/2 inch pieces of asparagus and about five tiny slices of red pepper. The worst part was the sauce, which tasted like a can of Campbell's cream of chicken soup poured over the risotto. Bummer. We felt like the dishes weren't inedible but weren't good either. I do highly recommend their kale Cesar salad, lobster bisque, wedge salad and the sourdough bread they bring to the table. I don't believe we will be back, however."}
{"text":"It's another American Italian restaurant; it's not even close to authentic Tuscan food. The food is overpriced I ordered the chicken breast with fried eggplant which was 18.00 for 2 pieces of grilled chicken breasts and one piece of fried eggplant.  It's not really worth your time.  The food isn't that good, sometimes the exception is the lobster bisque, but most of the time is uber salty.  The lettuce wedge was good, but drenched in blu cheese dressing and bacon.  The service is slow even thou most of the tables were empty when we went.  For 2 people we spent about 55-60.00, I could get 4 dishes for that much in Little Italy!!  the dessert is good, but not great.  The atmosphere is nice and dark, seems like a classy place.  BOTTOM LINE: save your pocket book and you time and get good, relatively authentic food in Little Italy"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service was a bit....lacking.

When i went the staff was fairly impersonal and didn't really seem to care that i was dining there, just saying."}
{"text":"I just love brio..out for the day at Town Square with my other half and had to go in for my fav.  Lunch bisteca salad and risotto yum yum...the risotto is the business chicken, butternut squash, asparagus and more goodness.  Like always great meal at Brio :)"}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour OK service!

I like coming for the happy hour but the service could really use some help! I've been coming here for about 4 years since its in a great central location.  It's easy to get people to meet here since its central to Summerlin and Henderson.  

There is outdoor dining as well as inside dining.  You can only get Happy Hour in the Bar/Lounge area and it is first come first serve for seating. It can get busy especially when the weather is nice so try to get here early especially if you have a decent size group. The outdoor area has fire pits set up as well which is perfect at night when it can get a little chilly.

Happy Hour is $4-$6 small plates and certain drinks.  The sangria is pretty good along with the martini (order it dirty and add Blue Cheese olives for a little extra!).  The beef carpaccio is delicious but not very filling so order a few if you have a decent size.  Some of my other favorites are the eggplant fries, and the black pepper shrimp with eggplant.

The problem with happy hour is either the bar staff isn't properly equipped or they are just too aloof to actually give good service. Every time we have to wave down our server for silverware, napkins, to put in additional orders, or to let him/her we are ready to pay.  On one specific occasion we tried to get the bartenders attention for 20 minutes to place more drink orders and he ignored us.  Finally as happy hour was ending he said sorry happy hour is over. Thats not good customer service in my opinion as I know he saw us trying to get his attention since we were sitting directly in front of him.

I have also come for brunch and the service was still a miss. We split the Tuscan omelette and the berries and cream French toast. Everything tasted pretty good.

Over all tasty Italian inspired cuisine for a good price with aloof service from staff members who would do well with a little customer service training."}
{"text":"I actually really like this place. I've eaten here more times than I can count. I'm a sucker for wonderful outdoor eating and this place has it. The food and wine are nice. This is one of the few Italian food places that my husband can go to because he is lactose intolerant. The cooks here are actually skilled enough and have the authority to make adjustments to several of their sauces and dishes to accommodate his allergy and still have the food come out tasting delicious."}
{"text":"I have been to lunch at the brio several times and is usually good. Not great but good.  My wife and I took another couple to dinner this last Sunday night.  We sat down about 7pm.  We were sat at a table for 6 people.  The wait staff did not remove the extra settings and we finally asked them to take them away.  We were given lunch menus and had to ask for dinner menus.  The bread came and it was cold and hard and the breadstick like items were soggy.  My friend tried to order a pale style beer, didn't have one, ordered a lager, didn't have one so he got a Sam Adams.  I ordered a whiskey sour, i couldn't taste the whiskey, drank it ordered another one and it was totally different than the first one, neither of them had a cherry.  They told us when we first sat down that there were only 4 lobster bisque soups left, my friend said he would take one, a minute later they brought us two and we still didn't even have the dinner menus, they took them away and gave them to another table which I thought was against health code.  We asked for more bread and got the same as before.  I ordered the shrimp venuto (or similar) and it when I came it was obvious it sat under the hear lamp for some time.  I thought it was terrible and actually spit out a few bites and didn't finish it.  Our friends pasta dishes also looked like they sat under a heat lamp for a while and no one finished their meals or even asked for a to go box, that's how bad the food was.  Our waters were not filled unless asked.  All in all a very bad dining experience, so bad I felt compelled to yelp.  Hopefully we just experience an off night. But with so many other dining venue to solicit, we will not be going back to the Brio."}
{"text":"Usually like Brio.....not this one.  Waited in the reception area ten minutes.  Finally greeted by a flustered woman who brusquely seated us.  Waited another ten minutes....no acknowledgement, no drinks, nada.  Mid afternoon, not rushed.  Left and went to the Cheesecake Factory and had a great lunch with excellent service from a well trained waitstaff who are obviously well managed."}
{"text":"OMG!  Best thing I ever ate!  The beef carpaccio was AMAZING!  I ate the whole thing, by myself!  The staff and service was wonderful!  I will be back for happy hour this week!  I also ordered the sausage/pepperoni flatbread pizza!  Too full to eat, taking home for the teenagers!"}
{"text":"WHOA!!!! Where has Brio been all expensive lunches in my life?!

The 2.95 happy hour is AMAZING! If portion size is too small for you...ORDER ANOTHER IT'S ONLY TWO NINETY FIVE!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW YYYYYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

- BRIO Burger - 
For 2.95 i was expecting one or two slider sized burgers. Nope they serve a FULL SIZED burger cut into quarters. The beef patty is pretty darn tasty but there's no condiments so after a few bites it could get pretty dull. Couple this with the salad from the Shrimptini or from the carpaccio and sauce it with the sauce from the shrimp and eggplant. 

- Ravioli Caprese - 
Not bad but no meat. The sauce ultimately makes the dish. Go early and they'll flood that plate with sweet tasty sauce, go late and there'll be a a few slabs of sauce on the plate.

- Chorizo Fonduta -
The 'Meh' of the menu. The fondu is a bit salty and is very rich.

- Beef Carpaccio - 
Thin strips of raw beef with a spring salad on top drizzled with some kind of mustard sauce with capers. WIN. 

- Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant -
Dont really like eggplant very much but OH MAN THAT SAUCE IS GOOD!!!

- Margherita Flatbread - 
Very nice, Very tasty, Could use more basil but overall it's perfect as a starter

- Shrimptini - 
Already peeled shrimp in a martini glass filled with tasty salad. Very refreshing and awesome as a starter or in between rich dishes like the shrimp and eggplant

- Sliced Steak Bruschetta - 
All you taste is the cheese and the greens but still this brushetta is DAMN tasty!!"}
{"text":"I ate here tonight with a few of my team members from work. 

I remember eating here about 4 years ago but wasn't impressed at the time so I hadn't been back. Tonight I was pleasantly surprised. 

The location is one of the best things about this restaurant. It is located in the heart of the beautiful Boca Park directly across from the complimentary valet in the south entrance round-about. 

We ordered a round of the Watermelon Berry Mojito special. The drink was poured well with balanced flavors and fresh ingredients (not from a premixed bottle). The fresh watermelon in the drink was delicious. At only $5 a glass I was impressed. 

They bring complimentary bread and Parmesan crackers with butter for the table and we ordered the red pepper bruschetta. The bruschetta was tasty and had a good bread to topping ratio and the bread wasn't overtly crusty which I appreciated. 

I ordered the Pasta Alla Vodka which was a ricotta-filled ravioli in the shape of pouches with spicy tomato Parmesan cream sauce and basil. Surprisingly the ravioli pouches were soft and creamy and appeared to be house made. The sauce was all around pretty tasty. 

One coworker ordered the Crab Cakes which came with roasted vegetables, crispy fingerling potatoes, and creamy horseradish. He ate the whole thing and said he enjoyed it very much. 

Our two other coworkers ordered the Pan Roasted Talapia and the Ravioli di Portobello. They said they liked it as well.

Our server Frank had great energy and had good suggestions for food and drinks. When we had completed our meal Frank took the time to shake each of our hands."}
{"text":"What a treat to find a beautifully decorated, first class establishment right in my backyard! Brio is wonderful. 
The three things we look for in a restaurant are service, ambiance and food quality and presentation.  The service is excellent with attentive greeters, wait staff and bar staff.  The ambiance of the restaurant is that of a Tuscan restaurant.  And to complete the trifecta, the food is presented beautifully and tastes as good as it looks.
It titillates your tastebuds and is aromatic with a variety of aromas, not just garlic, like many other Italian restaurants.

You must make a reservation. Brio is popular and with good reason.  When you are seated, warm bread and flatbreads are delivered to your table.  The servers we have had are all enthusiastic, attentive and affable.  They're knowledgeable about the food and stop by regularly to see how you're doing.  

The specials always are fantastic.  Recommended are surf and turf, penne a la vodka, any fish dish and any dessert )if you have room).  Sauces were distinctly delicious and different.  It's worth trying to find a parking spot in the mall!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is amazing there. The food is always good, and the ambiance is great! The beef carpaccio was awesome and at $4 I think I may have to become a regular!"}
{"text":"I have heard good things about Brio, and when my friend asked me to go with her, I was like \"sure, why not? Maybe this will be my new place to go\". but it's not...

When we walked in, I thought the decoration made the place feel so empty, maybe we went at a slow time? But I don't like the decoration at all. The waiter that served us, according to my friend, was a bit annoying. I thought he was okay, definitely not great though.

We had the spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer, I thought that one wasn't bad at all, I actually liked it. My friend and I shared a pasta (I don't remember the name), and I thought it was alright, it wasn't appealing. For dessert, we had creme brulee and tiramisu. The creme brulee was good, unlike most people, I like the filling more than the caramel part, and their creme brulee has more filling than other places, so I was very pleased. On the other hand, the tiramisu wasn't that great, there was a strong rum taste in it. Maybe it's just me, I don't like that having too much rum in the tiramisu, so it was bad to me.

Overall, this place is only a one time thing for me, I don't think I'll go back unless I want to give this place another try."}
{"text":"We stopped into Brio as we pulled into town for a fun weekend. We happened to be at Whole Foods and walked around the corner after seeing the 4 star rating. To our surprise, this place is gorgeous on the inside and very roomy. We were able to sit down promptly upon arrival and sat at the bar.  

We ordered 2 wedge salads which were amazing. They were about as fresh and tasty as a wedge salad can be. We also ordered a bbq chicken pizza or flatbread and a risoto. These were top notch dishes that an incredible amount of flavor. 

I would definitely recommend that anyone come by and try Brio. This is a top of the line restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place. Happy hour is best here. Large portions for affordable price. Bar Plates: $4-6 from 3:30-6:30pm. Dinner  food is great as well. Always good to make reservation around Christmas Holiday. Lots of Parties ! I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara Grilled chicken, bacon, Parmesan, and creamy Alfredo. Must try the Grilled Salmon Fresca* (LT) Grilled asparagus, sweet potatoes, spinach, red peppers, pesto vinaigrette, Feta, tomatoes, and balsamic. Last but not least - the Warm Chocolate Cake with Vanilla with bean gelato."}
{"text":"Love this place, fun for happy hour.  Sometimes overcrowded but it's nice to sit outside.  Great food and dessert!"}
{"text":"I love eating here!  The bartenders, particularly Alyssa, are fun and right on top of things!  Excellent tasty food with great service at the bar make for a very pleasant afternoon lunch!"}
{"text":"We had the pesto pasta with a side of Alfredo, half chicken and mashed potatoes, and the lamb chops! It was all so delicious and the bruschetta Quattro was amazing! I loved the tomato and mozzarella!

The lamb chops were by far the best I've had, not greasy at all and very flavorful! The mashed potatoes were also cooked so fluffy and delicious!"}
{"text":"BEST. ITALIAN. FOOD. HANDS. DOWN. Had a delightful experience of Brio catering to my club's recent luncheon. The food arrived on time and the presentation exceeded our expectations. Yummy yummy. We will be sure to have it again. Shout out to Brian for helping with our needs and being so accommodating on a short notice."}
{"text":"The menu reminded me a bit of Olive and Ivy, so much so that I was sure this was a part of Fox Restaurant Concepts (I was wrong; it's not).  But that's not a bad thing, as I enjoy Olive and Ivy very much!  I liked the atmosphere, it's subdued and relaxed, but I still felt comfortable bringing my baby, and saw several other families.  The food was good and the service was very friendly and prompt.  Overall it was a positive experience and I would go back."}
{"text":"wow!!!outside veranda is beautiful!big choice of menu.the portions is big and delicious .I really liked chocolate cake!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Had my sister 50 bday dinner. Everyone there was super nice. Great food. Thank you guys"}
{"text":"Second time dining at this place, first time was a hit and this time was no different. First thing, I noticed about this place is the layout. High, High Ceilings and the Overall decor looks so Grand, Open and Romanesque. Like its decorated for a Wedding Reception or Event of some sort.

We were greeted with smiles and quickly seated. Our hostess, immediately gathered and picked up the extra table settings in Lightning Speed and then handed our menus. WOHO! No more than 30 seconds our Server comes over and hands us the menu with a big smile and takes our drink orders. No more than a minute, a food runner brings us our drinks. A few minutes later, Our server politely comes by and asks us if we were ready to order and this is what we got:

\"Primi\" (Appetizers):

Calamari Fritto Misto: Big plate (easily shared by 3-4 people)! I loved the peperoncini mixed with the squid. Once in a while I would pick one up to spice it up a bit! Or sometimes it was a spicy surprise! Breading wasn't real golden brown and crispy. Came with 2 sauces on each side -Red sauce/Marinara type and Yellow sauce/Garlic Aioli. Red sauce typical pasta pizza sauce flavored. On the other hand, the Garlic Aioli was Absolutely Divine!! I don't know if its just me but that flavor got my attention real quick! It had a distinct flavor and a hint of horseradish mustard something that I couldn't get enough of! I didn't want to look like a dog but I would of Licked that plate clean with a shine! 

Spicy shrimp & Eggplant: Nice presentation, came on a long rectangle plate all lined up like in a straight line. Overall, flavor wasn't really impressive more disappointing if anything. The black pepper cream sauce wasn't as good as it sounded but the romano crusted egg plant was nice. Basically, after a few pieces, I was over it.. I guess that's why its an appetizer! But this felt heavy and after a few, I threw in the towel..

Entree:

Pasta Pomodoro with Chicken and added their Bistecca Insalata (salad): Another Heavy Weight plate, a generous mound of angel hair pasta, grilled chicken, pine nuts and their cilantro pesto drizzle. Plus some grated parmesan on top. Pretty straight forward dish and pretty good as well. It was just lacking 5 Stardom calibur, just like every other dish.. (Except for the salad, I'll get to that!).

*Bistecca Insalata: The Freshest Wedge of Iceberg Lettuce (crisp and almost neon green), Gorgonzola, real pieces of bacon (not dried bits), shiny red roma tomaotes and their mouthwatering creamy parmesan dressing!! One of the Best salads I've ever sunk my teeth in!!

Couldn't help but watch some of the staff really get to work. During our meal, we couldn't help but notice a vacant table behind us that was getting set for the next guest(s). The busser/server assistant was so precise and jaw dropping fast! I mean like watching a dvd and pressing forward like 3 times/3 arrows!! Just like everybody else here!! It's like the In N' Out Burger staff on a Redbull High!!! Also, I must mention our (Pregnant) Server did not skip a beat from refilling drinks, stopping by to check on the dinner status, to adding the extra Garlic Aioli sauces in our staff wrapped doggie bags! Service 5.5 Screaming Stars! Taste of Food 3.5-4 Stars (Bistecca salad 5+ stars), Value for amount of food 4-4.5 Stars and Ambiance 4.5 Stars.."}
{"text":"My husband and I went in there for dinner this evening! We have dined into Brio a few times in the past. We love their food. The pasta vodka is my favorite! We had a wonderful experience, and great service too! We appreciated the manager stopping at our table to see how everything was. Very friendly environment! We will definitely be back to try the layer cake!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Shrimp Mediterranean and a wedge salad through grub hub. They were both delicious. Even though it was delivery, the salad was cold and the Shrimp was perfectly cooked. I can't wait to actually go there to eat, though I don't know how the food could possibly be even better."}
{"text":"I don't usually like to rate chain restaurants but Brio was pretty darn good.  The service was friendly and efficient.  The pasta dishes were very good with large poritons.  I really don't have anything bad to say about this place.  Everyone seems to be mentioning the happy hour.  I'll have to come back to try that!"}
{"text":"My guy is a big fan of the not-so-chainish-chain, so we went to check out the new location in Scottsdale on opening night.  Thinking it would be busy up til the late hours, we went at 945 and it was empty, leaving us to be that awkward couple left in the restaurant.   The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a great tuscan feel and beautiful draping curtains everywhere; the dining room it a bit odd, however, being just big and open and THERE.

Our server was awesome, ensuring us that we were totally welcome to enjoy and take our sweet time.  Though the wine took forever to get to us, the bruchetta came out quick and was DELICIOUS - get the quattro, thats all I have to say.  Caeser was just ok.  

Pat ordered the Chicken Alla Sorrentina, which though he thought was only ok, I thought was fresh, flavorful, and wicked tasty.  I got the Penne Mediterranean - I had asked for extra tomato and onion; the server made a mistake and it had none rather than extra.  I pointed it out, and the server brought it out - stone cold straight from the fridge.  When mixed into the pasta, it was basically pure tasteless 1/2 hot 1/2 cold crap.  I told the server it was no bueno, and he sent the manager over immediately.  Before I could say anything, she opened with \"I heard your dinner was unsuccessful and unsatisfactory - I wanted you to know your entire dinner is on us\" and continued to offer to fix my meal or let me order whatever else I wanted!!!  That kind of customer service is rare and hard to find, and though this is not what I would expect every night at this restaurant (it was opening night after all) I was extremely impressed with the type of restaurant they were trying to establish.  

I will definitely be going back again not just for the customer service, but for the satisfying fair priced well cooked food.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Good food, great service.  Went here for just brunch, definitlly going to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"PLEASE go here for dinner ! If you're not feeling pasta they have GREAT steaks ! The service was so wonderful ! Everything about it was perfect ! I was able to cut my steak with a butter knife ! A BUTTER KNIFE PEOPLE !!! Please try it if you haven't ! Not to mention GREAT PRICES !"}
{"text":"Just went there tonight for early dinner. Was strolling around Town Square Mall, and my boyfriend was craving for pasta. The inside looks nice. Service is good. Pasta here is good. 

LOBSTER BISQUE - really good. Better to eat it slow because the spices can be strong and the taste may seem too powerful. 

RAVIOLI DI BELLO - I highly recommend!!!! Some raviolis I've had are dry, or has little meat, or has a sauce that's either bland or overpowering. This ravioli is none of those. It's great! It has the right amount of meat inside. Sauce is tasty. The mushroom gives more flavor. The tomato cleanses the palate. 

CAMPANELLE CARBONARA - It's good, but not the best I've had. 

We both had wine too. Total came up to $60+."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing.  We celebrated my grandmothers 85th  birthday here and it was amazing.  We had a party of 15 and the servers were really on top of it.  Really love this place."}
{"text":"Pros: 
* their carbonara pasta on their lunch menu is great. They mix it with bacon & spinach, and have the right about of cream sauce. 
* get the calamari!!! 
* friendly staff 
* clean, nice atmosphere. Can go for a casual lunch, business lunch as well as nice date. 
* good location. Who doesn't love Town Square? 

Cons:
* their Caesar salad was weak."}
{"text":"I had heard how great this place was so I had to try it. First impression was an arrogant hostess who was more concerned with marking off her floor chart or station map than greeting me. I was sat and ordered the Lobster Bisque which was amazing, the bread was awesome. My server Jade was excellent as well. I ordered the Veal Marsala and it was extremely bland and tasteless. Not even the sauce could save it, Marsala usually has a nice, nutty flavor. It had no flavor at all, very disappointing. After seeing the decor and tasting the bread and the Bisque I was expecting a great meal, it was far from it. A microwave meal has more flavor....."}
{"text":"This is a lively restaurant. It was Tuesday night during the week of the magic fashion trade show and it was a packed restaurant. Everything we ordered was delicious. See the pics. The service was excellent and the manager even came by to see how we were doing. The group I was with routinely comes to this restaurant every time they are in Vegas because they love the food so much. There is some lovely outdoor seating and the restaurant is nestled within a beautiful outdoor shopping center."}
{"text":"The service was what made our experience satisfying. We told Tony the waiter that one of us was vegan and he had the chef make something special which was fabulous. Ambiance was nice. We have been here many times but this was the best. Thank you Tony."}
{"text":"We sat a booth at the bar for about 10 minutes when some guy walking by gave us some water.  After another 5-10 minutes another guy walked by and finally gave us some menus.  No drink order, nothing.  Finally left after about 30 minutes of basically no service.  I could understand if they were busy but there were 2 people sitting at the bar and another lady in a booth."}
{"text":"Loved it, we sat outside in the evening and we had a great time. The service was very friendly with genuine care. The food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant...I was impressed. We stopped in early in a Saturday and were told it would be a 50min wait but bar seating was first come first served. We decided to look around and found a table in the back corner of the bar. It took a little bit but our server finally came over and took our drink order. He was very knowledgeable with the wine list and my wife went with one of his suggestions for a Pinot Grigio and she enjoyed it. I couldn't decide on an entree so I went with some small plates. I started with the lobster bisque which was flavorful but skimpy on the lobster. Next I had a Caesar salad and an order of calamari. The salad was rather large and a good value. The calamari was excellent except for the aioli. I tried a little and decided to stick with the marinara that accompanied it. I'm a calamari traditionalist...what can I say? My wife had the pasta Brio which consisted of rigatoni, grilled chicken, and mushrooms in a roasted red pepper sauce. She liked it and so did I. I'm not a huge fan of chains but Brio does it right. We will definitely be back the next time we decide to visit Crocker Park."}
{"text":"Ordered Togo they didn't provide me with everything I asked for. Spoke to a manager she sent out a gift card. Next visit I ate there.. my server was so hard to reach and on top of that my son had a bug in his drink. The server didn't apologize nor did the manager and she also knew about it. Food is good, but I don't recommend this location. Town square a much better option."}
{"text":"Finally went to Brio today, for lunch.

First thing I said when we walked in, \"are they owned by Cheesecake Factory?\"  The atmosphere is Cheesecake Factory-esque, with a Tuscan flare.

The menu is pretty big, nothing really stood out to me on it though.  Their brunch menu items looked like they had some potential but I was not in a brunch mood unfortunately.  Had the Lobster bisque to start, pretty good, but I've had better.  (The Lobster Bisque at Ocean Club REALLY spoils you.....lol)  Sister had the Beef Carpaccio appetizer...which was HUGE.  It's a huge, long plate of thinly sliced carpaccio with a small bunch of mixed greens in the center...it was pretty good, but nothing that I went crazy over.

Had the Pasta alla Vodka for entree and again, pretty good but nothing amazing.  They are little ricotta filled pasta purses (don't know the technical pasta name for them, so that's how I'd best describe them!), in a delicious tomato/parmesan/vodka sauce with smoked bacon.  Very tasty, but not life changing.

Food wise, it kinda reminded me of an Olive Garden, but a little more upmarket.  Maybe if Olive Garden made love to a Cheescake Factory....you'd end up with a Brio Tuscan Grille?"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!!!  I tried this restaurant for the first time and it was WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!  I ordered the lobster bisque, pasta alla vodka and caramel marscapone cheesecake. Everything was perfection (and I never say that about Italian food other than my own lol).  Very highly recommended and rather than using Door Dash, next time I will need to experience the ambiance of the restaurant."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I was super disappointed when I finally got here to eat. I was hoping for the four star experience raved about on Yelp but was left really cold by this place.

First, not super friendly or super attentive. They get you what you need but it's at snail's pace and I was starving.

I ordered the calamari and it was okay. It didn't have a fresh flavor and it was mushy instead of crispy. It came out with the marinara sauce to dip in, but there was this other blob of white sauce that looked like mayo had been out sitting on the counter on a warm afternoon. Obviously steered clear of that salmonella-listeria-cyclospora petri dish and tried not to gag. 

Because I had overindulged with the fried mess above I asked if I could just have capellini tossed with olive oil. They accommodated me in the way of a half a cup of spaghetti for $8.00. WTF? They had dishes on the menu that included vegetables, meat and sauce for that price. I felt thoroughly ripped off and will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Like they say, you can put lipstick on a pig...but its still a pig. The food and the service are NOT what I expect from this beautifully decorated restaurant. I would have been better off at Caraba's. 

I've been to Brio about 3 times now. The 3rd (and likely last) time was a recent Sunday for brunch. There were 7 adults and 4 children. Our server seemed disorganized from the time she took our order to the time we had to hunt her down thru a passing server to ASK for the check.  

Our entrees came out in batches. Some at my table were eating 3-4 minutes before my food arrived. I expected all the food to come out at the same time...even if that meant our server had assistance. To top it off, my food was cold. My salad that I ordered for appetizer was over dressed and the lettuce wilted. 

When a woman in my party asked for water, the server only brought ONE water. She didn't ask anyone else at the table if they'd like water also. When the server brought the single water, she made it a point to say \"we don't automatically serve water\". I know we have a water shortage in AZ, but damn! At least ask! 

Only the kids and the 2 adults who ordered French Toast seemed pleased w/ their food. 2 of the kids probably don't count, as they are 1.5 years old! These growing boys were just happy to be eating! 

Fantastic food can make bad service bearable. Outstanding service & presentation can make \"OK\" food great. But mediocre service AND food call for a 3 strikes and you're out in my eyes."}
{"text":"Pasta is okay, but the salad is really good I got a harvest salad the chicken was delish and so was the dressing. Service was great but I'm not a fan of their food the ambience is nice. No super expensive it's moderate. Love the location and the parking so close! Thanks to the yelp event I got $25 off yay! Thanks yelp! I don't know if I'll be back I wasnt wowed or anything. My friend did say the lemon drops were exceptional!"}
{"text":"My husband and I first ate at brio Tuscan grille in Las Vegas for our wedding reception. Today we are celebrating our wedding anniversary at the scottsdale brio Tuscan grille. The food was great as usual but the service was even better. Our server was Aaron. He was very attentive, answered all our questions and was constantly checking up on our needs. Aaron at brio Tuscan grille was awesome made the whole experience even better. .."}
{"text":"Two words: HAPPY HOUR! great prices on food and drinks here, one of my favorites. My friends love it here, great atmosphere."}
{"text":"These please is very dear to me it's where my girlfriend and I had our first date back in 2013 it's now 2016 and my girlfriend took me out for my birthday these evening and the food is always good you look around and the waiters are fast and always moving the food came out fast and it was nice and hot. What made this evening AWESOME was our waiter ALBERTO he was very friendly and always attentive he had like 6 full tables in our section and he was on top of all of them really kind, efficient, and really felt like we were a priority to him will definitely be going back more often and hopping to have him as our waiter"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and I would for sure go back just for that again! We had the happy hour version of the following: burger, pizza, bruschetta, and ravioli. Each was $3! Only thing better would have been better drinks on happy hour. There wasnt much of a selection of draft beer or cocktails--and the prices werent as good as the food. It was packed when we arrived on a Friday evening. The service was great considering the rush at the bar area."}
{"text":"Im adding this as a heads up for vegetarians.  This place doesn't offer much for us and if you have to ask for alternates, like leave out the meat, price remains high.  For us the price is mid to high.  Server was outstanding, did his best to please us, i wish i remember his name.  The salad I ordered, three tomatos something, not excellent.  Server said without the chicken it gets mixed reviews.  Anyway go elsewhere if you're a veggie cause there are much better \"Italian\" places with better selections."}
{"text":"We had been to the sister restaurant in Town Square and food is always good there.
Was running errands this side of town and decided to stop for happy hour.
The staff was friendly and service was prompt. Food was delicious and portion was good size.
Will be back"}
{"text":"Keeping in my mind that I've done nothing but appetizers and drinks here, and only at the bar area, I'm kind of a fan. The bartenders have generally been very nice and attentive. And the outdoor bar part is actually kind of a nice place to sit. The appetizers have all been ok, but nothing too impressive. What I have found most impressive is their $5 martinis on Thursdays during happy hour. All of the martinis I have sampled have been absolutely delicious. And for $5, well, you just can't beat that."}
{"text":"Jenny went above and beyond to take excellent care of us.  We'll be back.  Thank you for really taking all of our needs into consideration.  I am so glad we didn't go to Echo & Rig!"}
{"text":"There are way better original italian places to go...I promise"}
{"text":"I've been here for a few family dinners. When I see family ,I'm talking 15 people at the table. For some reason Brio can't handle large groups. It's never easy.  Always chaotic. And the food honestly isn't that great."}
{"text":"I think you have to adjust a little for it being on Valentine's Day and bearing that in mind it was good. We got there 20 minutes before out 8:45 reservation and were hoping to be seated earlier, but unfortunately it was just super busy and we were seated at res. time. We spent some time looking over the menu and it did take a while to order. My gf ordered the shrimp and lobster pasta which she said was very good if not phenomenal. I ordered the filet only to find a few minutes later that they just ran out. So, I went with the New York Fiorentina which turned out to be quite good as far as New Yorks go (not usually my favorite). Grilled and seasoned very well which is a must for the chewier cut. Overall recommended with friendly and professional service."}
{"text":"Always good. Never a disappointment. We booked a room to celebrate my daughter 16th bday and the service was on point. Food was excellent and always at the right temperature. 

Unfortunately we were not offered to take left overs and I didn't realized until the end to ask for them and I was told none was saved. 

A little disappointed on that but I will remember for next time."}
{"text":"I take clients here because it's a place I can always rely on. The food is consistently fresh and expertly-prepared, with a professional and gracious staff, and an outstanding interior and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had such an amazing experience here last week. 

Dined here after early day from work with my best friend and my grand parents. We had appetizers, lunch (nana and I had pastas, zach and my papa had sandwiches, we had deserts (lava cake, cheesecakes, and tiramisu, wine, and coffee) and the entire meal was exceptional.

Lunch was super busy, but they always kept an eye on us and made sure we were well taken care of. 

I have always had an amazing experience at Brio and love it there. Check it out for date night or for a nice family dinner."}
{"text":"It was my very time eating, the atmosphere of walking inside was phenomenal and the food was spectacular! Service was great and especially eating outside during the night sky was perfect as well. Most definitely coming back again real soon!"}
{"text":"Good place, decent happy hour. Good food. I used to give this place 5 stars but every time i come here (which is monthly) Im always reminded of something that somehow seemed to slipped my mind when writing my earlier review (the most important tips often somehow manage to do that, but thats why they have an 'update review' option, thank you yelp for catering to us frequently distracted folk) and thats the extremely weak drinks. Ok people now the frequency of my drinking consists of maybe 3-4 drinks a week and during/with dinner and i weigh about 100 lbs. personally i wouldn't call myself a heavy drinker and NORMALLY at a restaurant a drink or 2 will do me just fine. Not this place. It takes about 4, yes thats 4, and no I'm not exaggerating. I've sent back drinks numerous times (something i freaking hate and would much rather avoid, but this place leaves me no choice really) and the next drink maybe, maybe might be enough to make a dent. But then obviously when i come back again i have to do the 'send the water and ice drink i just paid $6 back and hopefully they send a real drink out next time dance'. Its just kind of annoying and its how it goes ALMOST every time. note the almost is because more often than not when i come here i pay $6 for water, ice and some sugar juice stuff but in the past (but not anymore :( ) I've had a really good bar tender (he has a mustache you can't miss him!) who actually knew how to make a real drink. But for the past few months i keep getting stuck with some other bar tender. If you don't drink then sorry if you read this whole review. Like i stated earlier the food is great and the atmosphere is nice. Despite there overpriced water/ice/juice drinks (they call them alcoholic beverages on the menu) i still frequent here monthly. Definitely recommend it."}

{"text":"I tried their lasagna for the first time and thought it tasted average.  I truly was not impressed."}
{"text":"It is your traditional Olive Garden type restaurant. Service was pretty good. Food was mediocre. I ate there, probably won't go back. It just wasn't that outstanding. If you're looking for a nice relaxing place to eat outdoors, this is a pretty place. 

At the risk of sounding like a fake Yelper....let me tell you about a place I found nearby that was AMAZING. Check out Rice Trax. Wish they'd been open on Sunday, then I wouldn't have had to eat at Brio. ;-)"}
{"text":"I've always love Brio it's one of those places that lands in between Casual and Classy. It's perfect for a couple steps above average casual dinner date or a fancy enough dinner party. No matter how you put it it's a nice place to dine weather you're here for a work gathering or dinner for 2 it's perfect and their food is great. 

I was here recently for my father in laws big 5 oh and we had our party in their small banquet room. I've been in this room before for his parents 50th anniversary and it works for a small private group. The service here is awesome and the staff is really accommodating as far as cakes, flowers, decor and slide show goes. 

The food and drinks are always good as expected. We had at this party a four coarse meal. Staring off with 2 choice of salad an Italian chop and a Cesar's wedge with bacon yum! Then we were served the apps calamari and something else I can't remember but their calamari are battered and delicious crispy enough and had great seasoning paired with marinara dipping sauce. The family style entrees were lemon chicken with capers or something like that, steak and this very good cheese tortellini 
Pasta dish. All this and bread and butter as well. 

As usual all the food maws very good and the dessert (2 options) tiramisu and cheese cake were really yummy and presented really nice...not pictured boo. But regardless Brio is always a nice place to dine and the food is always satisfying!"}
{"text":"happy hour- yummy
I love the white sangria and the flat bread pizza
spicy shrimp and eggplants it was good
crispy shrimp piccante- excellent"}
{"text":"Brio has an amazing menu, Ive tried a few different dishes including eating off my husband's plate and have never been disappointed! The wait wasn't long, when we went on a Saturday night. It was packed but not too loud. Staff was prompt and courteous. Prices were average. Ambiance was very nice, and overall I would love to eat here weekly!"}
{"text":"My first time trying This restaurant and I looooved  it... First and foremost I had the best server his name is Frank he gave me and my family an excellent service, he was fast, he asked questions to see what I will like to eat, without asking he noticed that my moms water was almost finished he kept on coming and refilling our water. Frank is super friendly and has 5 star customer service skills. Thank you Frank.... it's not easy to satisfy my parents when we go to restaurants they always find something they are not happy about  the food but they loved the food in Brio it was delicious and we will be back soon..."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, good food.  Nothing overly special.  PLike the fact they now mark light food choices, under 650 Cal's."}
{"text":"One of the BEST places in Vegas. Always great food and service."}
{"text":"Brio is an amazing Italian restaurant! Their service is always friendly, especially tonight, we had Kaitlin, she was just fantastic; warm, friendly and very helpful! 

The ambiance is a classy, yet laid back.  Sometimes it can get a little noisy on Friday/Saturday evenings, but that is to be expected at delicious, popular places.

Food is phenomenal, we always get the bruschetta quattro, and it's always delicious! Tonight I had their Lobster Bisque, and it's was creamy and flavorful! They have an extensive wine list, too!

My Italian fiancé loves this place, too!
(What an endorsement, right?!)

I look forward to coming back here with my family!

Be sure to make a reservation!! :)"}
{"text":"Overall Brio was just ok. I would have to try it one more time in order for me to recommend it. Service was no problem, our server was attentive. 
We ordered pesce picatta and chicken Marsala and calamari and wedding soup to start. Wedding soup was very good but, calamari was room temp and over cooked. 
Chicken Marsala had good flavor but over cooked mushrooms and very little of them. In the pesce picatta the fish was cooked well but, the dish overall had no flavor. I was expecting lemon and caper flavor instead it was bland. We had to ask for more Marsala sauce and picatta sauce which made up for initial lack of sauces."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Fleming's, Maestro's, Ruth's Chris, but I have never had a better steak for the price than the one I had here. The Gorgonzola crusted filet is hands-down the best entrée on the menu. The meal should easily be priced in the $50s, but is under $30 with sides. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Brio did a wonderful job with my bff's wedding reception, so for that, they get 3 stars.

But the gluten-free pasta primavera was hard, chewy and bland and the mushrooms tasted microwaved. And the server only mentioned the complimentary reception wine after making it appear like you could only get cocktails (which were not included with the wedding reception). Y U HOLD OUT ON ME?"}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this place that warrants a return visit. Our party of 6 was seated right on time for our 5:15 reservations. The restaurant was not busy this particular Sunday night, but reservations are recommended. We were quickly served hot bread and butter which was a good start because I was starving!  Our server was nice, but she was inconsistent. After she took our orders, we hardly saw her again. Someone else brought our dinner to the table, and we were all shocked that they didn't offer cheese. This is supposed to be an Italian place right?? We had to wait a while for our server to come back and check on us and then we were able to ask for fresh parmesan. After that, we hardly saw her again except when it came time to drop off the check. Even after that, she disappeared for a good 20 minutes and we needed some things on our bill adjusted so we finally had to flag someone down to ask them to tell our server to come back to the table. 

The food, meh, nothing special and surely over priced. I went with the chicken under the brick, which is a grilled chicken breast with marsala mushroom sauce, served with mashed potatoes and veggies. The marsala sauce was really good, I just wish there were more of it. I loved the vegetables that came with my meal especially the carrots, they were a tad sweet so I think they might have been glazed. I also ordered a side chopped salad which was just okay as well. For each side salad it was $4.95! That is for lettuce, a few chopped veggies, and dressing. The bill for just me and my mom was $54! Other people in my party agreed the food was just okay and definitely overpriced. I hear they have a good happy hour, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but I wouldn't be opposed to trying the happy hour."}
{"text":"I normally go to the Brio in Town Square as it is closer to where I live; however, I was on this side of town and decided to come to this location with a friend. It was setup very nicely, although I prefer the look and setup in Town Square (Thats just personal preference). The food was delicious as always and the staff was there to service, very friendly! 

The staff did seem a little \"on edge\" and checking everything, but that is okay by me! I also think they were like that because it opened very recently, so they are still getting into the routine. Regardless, simply wonderful! I am sure with time this location will be just as popular as the Town Square location."}
{"text":"My 2nd trip to this restaurant.  This time we Celebrated my 19th Anniversary here 4 days ago.  Our waiter was outstanding:). The locations of the restaurant is perfect. The hostess not so much as she had trouble seating us ... The broccoli sprouts that came with the braised beef short ribs were overcooked and I don't recall tasting the pecans.  I was slightly disappointed.  Their seasonal margaritas are refreshing tho:)"}
{"text":"Had a lot of fun. Our waiter was extremely helpful and had great recommendations. A little pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place randomly and loved it. The atmosphere, decor, food and even the location is great. I ordered the lamb chops. Huge portion (no way I could finish it) and delicious. My side was Brussel sprouts and it was made with amazing sauce. My husband ordered the Gorgonzola meat tenders and of course I tried it with mash potatoes and veggies. Everything was delicious. 
The waiter wasn't as amazing as the place and the food - but overall it was a great place in Town Square. 
When we return to Vegas, I'm sure to come back. 

PS they have outside seating with misters! So you don't get too hot."}
{"text":"I just love when there is 15 to 20 empty tables and the snooty hosts make you wait 10 to 20 minutes to seat you, great food anyway"}
{"text":"TUSCAN GRILLE - so why is there only 5 pasta dishes on the latest menu??  Which they change like the staff every 5 months - always removing the favos of the regulars of course and wondering why it nowhere near as busy as it was a few years ago.

Yes - I've been going for 5 years now.......sometimes every week...for awhile

But 6 months ago stopped - because they just cant seem to get anything right in this place!!
Always an issue with ordering and getting it wrong as ordered.....then WAITING again while other people eat at your table - which is the ANTITHESIS of why people go out to dine!!

The chefs - don't understand English well - so they don't read the orders correctly....been an issue for years now.....ex staff told me so on many occasions

Went last night - same situation - I mean COME ON!  Got my order wrong - had to wait while my wife ate hers - which came with NO SAUCE  - chicken Limone - its ALL ABOUT THE SAUCE - yet the last 5 times - there is little to NO sauce...have to ask for more...then it take 10 minutes....food is cold.  Same crap. BRIO - Are you guys saving pennies on the sauce???? Is that WHY there is none????

Tired of the excuses and constant wrong items arriving at table.....it was not busy....it was Thurs....

This location's days are definitely numbered...."}
{"text":"Wow talk about getting treated like a loser as soon as you walk in the door. First off the only reason I even went to this place is because we were about to see a movie. On any other night I would never suggest this place. FIrst of all the waitress seemed as if she was on crystal meth , she was very rude and not informative at all. Salad was vintage, my entree was absolutely terrible. All the waiters had chin straps looking like a high school football team . Sucky atmosphere. Sucky Music. This PLACE SUCKS!"}

{"text":"AMAZING!  Everyone absolutely loved their food.  Often times pastas are uninspiring more often than not, but not at Brio.  Ambiance is excellent, service was also top notch and yum yum yum to every bite we took.  We will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I'm rating based on waiting on my reservation. If there were negative stars the reservation staff deserves it. Made a reservation, and showed up 35 mins early. Asked if it was better to keep on my reservation or to get on the wait list and low and behold everyone in the lobby has been seated before us, including wait and reservations. This is ridiculous.

Asides from the horrible hostess service, the manager was apologetic about the situation and our server and food was superb. Everything came out on time and tasted great. Drinks were filled and we were checked on frequently. Dishes were large portions so come hungry."}
{"text":"Been to this location a handful of times, always enjoyed coming here. But today we had a waitress who had a unwelcoming attitude the whole time which made my family uncomfortable. I will be back, but please don't give me Erika."}
{"text":"Ask for Gus! He's a great server. He was so friendly and very attentive. 

My roommate and I decided to come here on a Thursday night after a long day of work. We had to wait about 10 mins to be seated. But once we were seated, we were greeted right away by Gus. We ordered: the spaghetti bolognese, beef carpaccio, caprese salad, lobster bisque soup, and calamari.

The spaghetti bolognese was so creamy! It was amazing. The beef carpaccio is ALWAYS on point. So flavorful. The caprese salad was... eh, nothing special. The lobster bisque soup was some of the best soup I have ever had, to be completely honest. And the calamari was nothing short of yum. For dessert we got the chocolate cake with a side of vanilla gelato. It was okay, nothing spectacular. But I'll definitely be back for the beef carpaccio and lobster bisque!"}
{"text":"Went to Brio Tuscan Grille in Kierland for a lunch meeting.  It was the perfect atmosphere to do business - prompt service, good food, lots of space, and a moderate pace to the meal.   Plus, upscale food at reasonable prices.  A very diverse menu and lunch specials ranging from $7.95 to around $20

I had the salad and risotto lunch for $11.95.  A huge wedge salad and a solid portion of the sweet potato and chicken risotto.  There was a considerable amount of meat in the risotto (I actually would have preferred less) and the rice was well seasoned with chicken stock, sweet potato, asparagus, and onions. Bread and flatbread were brought to the table before we ordered.

The service could have been a little more attentive.  The server admitted she was new to the restaurant, but seemed unnecessarily nervous or distracted. I'm sure with a little more training, this will be a 5-star experience!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place! Food is great and you wont be disappointed with the menu! The service was excellent, people were all very nice, bellini was awesome! I've had a few things here that were just ok, which is why I gave it a 4 star and not 5.  

The gorgonzola crusted lamb chops were delicious, but heavy (as lamb can be, but still).  They were good but needed something lighter to go with it rather than the olive oil covered spinach.  Bruschetta was pretty good, I recommend the sausage or the prosciutto tomato basil one.  The one with steak was too dried out.  The food was still good though and the ambiance is great!"}
{"text":"Service top notch!
The food was right on point!
App's were fast and delicious.

Live music added so much!!"}
{"text":"We went to Brio for dinner the other night after hearing good things about it from friends and family.  

We asked to be seated on the patio as it was a gorgeous evening especially as Canadians!  The patio was gorgeous and after the first plane scared the cheap out of us we were used to them.

We ordered the calamari to start, the plate was a little bit sloppy with the dips just dumped on either side but the calamari was amazing and the dips were both decent.

For dinner I had the chicken carbonara which was super tasty and my husband had the mushroom ravioli with brown butter ravioli which he said was out of this world amazing.  I tasted the brown butter sauce which was super delicious with a great depth of flavour.

The very best part of the night was the trio of desserts.  A walnut cake of some sort, a vanilla bean creme brûlée and a caramel mascarpone cheesecake.  The creme brûlée was amazing.  It was silky smooth with a great vanilla bean flavour, and the mascarpone cheesecake was light and airy with an amazing caramel flavour, by far the best desserts of our vacation.

We will definitely visit Brio again."}
{"text":"Italian food inspired by Tuscany...well, I've never been to Tuscany but I do love Italian food and I wouldn't say the flavors seemed that authentic but I enjoyed my meal and service. Went for brunch on a Sunday and our group was seated fairly quickly. The clean and beautiful decor captured my eye. There was a bridal shower going on next to our table and they were taken care of nicely by the servers.

Our waitress and waiter were attentive and friendly. Started off with bread and butter, would have liked some oil and vinegar because that makes me think Italian. After looking at their menu for 15 minutes, because I couldn't decide from all the amazing choices, I ordered the Tuscany Harvest Salad. Came with grilled chicken,  mushrooms, bacon, almonds, Gorgonzola cheese, apples, dried cranberries, crispy lavoush, and Tuscan dressing. It was DELICIOUS! 

I still had room for dessert and their dessert platter had a nice variety so I went with the BRIO's Famous Cheesecake which was creamy and topped with caramalized sugar and creme anglaise. Every bite I took made me fall in love all over again. 

Their brunch menu has some great choices and I would not mind returning to this place or hosting a dinner party. Good choice, glad we yelped it. It's located in a town center so parking can be a pain but there are plenty of shops to walk around in."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot! See Candace at the bar..."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and I'm always pleased. Very good food and service is great. I mainly come here because of the atmosphere. It's located in town square, so it's great to meet friends here and shop around afterwards. The inside is just so classy and romantic. Thought I'd finally leave a review after coming  here so many times! This time they had seasonal items and we ordered the scallops risotto and the pasta ala vodka. The food is maybe just a bit semi pricier than it should be, but I figure you're paying for the setting and the nice service. Love the sourdough bread they give when seated!"}
{"text":"I think the bartenders are either overworked or having a bad day, because they are certainty busy doing a lot of prep work behind the bar. Unfortunately management needs to realize, if you are over working your bartenders, then their service suffers. There seems to be a lot of people behind the bar, but few who can serve, and it's apparent the ones who can are having a bad day."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 20 times... usually at the bar area.  Consistent food, great wine, solid service... great atmosphere.  Also had private dining in the chef's room for our engagement dinner.  Good food.  Good times and nice location inside Town Square.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Came here for my sisters birthday. Service was exceptional. Food was amazing!!!! I always have a great experience here and every time I come here I am always with a large group. As a matter a fact I also had a private party here for my daughter last year that occupied the entire back. I love it here that much. Sad to say I will probably not come back here. As we were leaving they were closing the curtains. Running over all of us that was seated. I would have been nice to tell us in advance. They stepped on my foot as they were doing and didn't apologize. Just laughed and said oh excuse me. My guest and I Felt that was rude and I was quite embarrassed because I was the one that suggested this place to have my sister's bday dinner."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was good.the bathrooms were clean and the atmosphere was awesome in the restaurant."}
{"text":"LOVE BRIO! Their menu truly is for everyone! They have such a great selection..especially their \"light menu!\" I rave about their chop sald.. seriously one of the best I've had even for just a simple salad! Their servers at this location are OK. The past 2 times I haven't had the best service, and I was actually surprised that the service on a Monday afternoon was terrible. Took quite awhile for everything and the busser decided to take our dessert before we were even done with it.. said he would bring another one because it was his fault, but never returned with another dessert. Oh well. Will always come back to Brio though!"}
{"text":"Came here for the second time and there was a wait. Of course there was, it's the Christmas season and it was 6 pm on a cold night. 
So I made reservations for 7 and we were seated 7:05 minutes. 
Our waiter was ok and he took forever in getting our water, soda, etc. but i pardoned that. 
The food though, was very good. I ordered spaghetti with pancetta and vodka sauce (off menu) and our waiter still had the kitchen make it. The calamari was hot and mouth watering with slivers of peppercinis fried and mixed in with 2 sauces on the side. The table bread was a choice of crisp bread and sourdough, and that was even delicious. 
If you're shopping at Town Square and you don't mind paying $18 - $25 a person for a good Italian dinner, then this is the place."}
{"text":"Lovely lovely food! Been here twice and I love the atmosphere. I'm not into their spaghetti here but the main dishes and appetizers are nice!!"}
{"text":"Me: \"I'll have a Bellini.\"

Bartender:  \"In this bar that is a frozen beverage.  Will that be acceptable?\"

Me:  \"No, thank you, I'll join my husband and have a mojito.  Thanks for telling me.\"

Bartender:  \"You're welcome.  I thought you'd want to know.\"

That got us off to a very good start as we had a 3:00pm lunch in the bar at Brio after an enjoyable visit to Hoover Dam and Lake Mead.  Why the bartender thought I might care if the Bellini was authentic or not I do not know but she was right.  And it was the first step in stellar service that continued through the process of making the drinks, taking our food order and until the time we walked out at the end of our meal.  

Not only was the service great, the food exceeded our expectations, and the setting was lovely, hence the four stars.  

Brio is part of a small chain and as a rule we avoid chains, in particular when they involve 'staged opulence' interiors as here.  Different strokes for different folks and we simply lean to smaller, privately owned places with less flash..  But a local woman we met at Aria and with whom we discussed food (favorite topic for her too) recommended Brio and thought we'd be pleasantly surprised.  So in need of a late lunch, we headed to Town Center Mall (Whole Foods is also located here) and Brio.

We split the barbequed chicken flatbread and it was tasty...crispy thin crust, delicious sauce with just the right amount of chipotle, white meat chicken, feta and cilantro.  Served very hot from the oven, it was a great partner for the refreshing, well made mojitos..  We finished up by sharing the creme brulee trio, relying on the recommendation of another yelp reviewer, and thought all three brulee options (cleverly presented in demitasse cups) were good for flavor even if the sugar toppings had lost their crispness.

Our food and two cocktails were about $35 so a decent price.  

Based on this single experience, we would return to eat at a Brio Tuscan Grille again if we find one at some other point in our travels."}
{"text":"The pasta is pretty good here but their lobster bisque is even better. It's a distance away for me but it's worth the drive. Also the service is really good. The restaurant has a classy look to it and their design is really nice."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times for several years with my lunch group and always a good experience. No one has ever been unhappy with the food. Service can be spotty from excellent to slow even when the restaurant has few patrons it can be very slow. Parking is the one stumbling block so we all tend to avoid when the snowbirds are here. Shopping at the Quarter is difficult if you will need to go back and forth to your car since there is only garage parking, one way in and out."}
{"text":"The Skinny: in general, below average Italian (2.5) service is very hit or miss (3) value: at $13-15 for an entree you could do much better elsewhere (2.5).

When we attended my Hubby's annual Christmas party, he had the unfortunate luck of winning a gift card for Brio Tuscan Grill. As soon as they called his name for the prize, my heart just sank into the bottomless pit of despair. Not to mention the hubs signed me up for their rewards program so I get a coupon now every year for my birthday. 

WTF!?!?!? I swear, my hubs hates me. As if it isn't traumatic enough getting 1 year older.

I can't tell you the amount of vitriol I have for Brio Tuscan Grill but that would take way more than the 5000 character limit that Yelp sets out for reviews.

I mean, it's not that the food is absolutely disgusting. It isn't. It's all edible. But that's about it. Considering the exorbitant prices for the level of cuisine, this joint represents all the things that are repellent about dining in the Summerlin area: generic, pricey for what it is, and a hot spot for the geriatric crowd whose taste buds have been ruined by the multitude of meds they take. And don't forget the f*(king patio dining. Like I said, mediocrity at its finest.

If you must come, come for lunch as the prices are a lot better.

Okay, seeing as I have been forced to eat here more times that I care to, I'll let it loose on a few of the many items I have tried.

Lobster bisque ($6.95): too much sherry not enough lobster = pass.

Salads (including Caesar, Grilled Salmon salad) are pretty bad here. Have yet to ever have a salad here without finding some wilted lettuce mixed in. In addition to that, the dressings are all really generic. And what the heck is up with all the cheese they put on everything? What is up with all this gorgonzola? Pass.

Calamari ($10.45/lunch price): First of all, the plating. Have no idea who thought that putting the marinara and cream sauce (neither one which is particularly good), in the same bowl of the fried calamari. This makes all the fried food soggy. Not to mention the deep fried peperoncini represents half of the plate of greasy calamari.

Mezza Chicken under the Brick ($14.85/lunch): The roasted chicken is fine, the marsala sauce is decidedly meh. The plate is very small for the $14.85 price tag. 

Pasta alla vodka ($16.15/lunch): My husband usually gets this. Me, I think it's okay. But given the price and the serving size, it's ridiculous. Pass on this one.

The only dish I have ever really truly liked there and thought that it was worth it was a special they had. It was a truffle oil flatbread with arugula, mushrooms and proscuitto. They had that for about $10.

Given that I would likely pass on nearly everything I tried there, I don't recommend coming here as for the above mentioned reasons. Though edible, their food is expensive for what it's worth. 2.5 starred review bumped down to 2 stars."}
{"text":"I just want to give a round of applause to Jarrett!!  My husband and I had a date night (which is a rare occasion, because we have a 17-month old son) and we came to Brio with only 45 min before our movie started.  We knew we loved the food, but would we be able to get what we wanted and get to the movie in 45 min?  We had our doubts--but Jarrett made it happen.  To make things even more difficult for him, we ordered everything :)  Appetizers, alcohol, salads, main courses AND dessert to go!!  He gave us amazing service, and the food was fantastic!  We were out the door in 40 min--can you believe it? at a sit-down, upscale restaurant??  Awesome!!  I had the artichoke-crusted beef with mashed potatoes, a bistecca salad and we split a sampler of bruschetta.  My husband also had a salad and he ordered lasagna.  Everything was yummo and the service was impecable!  Ask for Jarrett next time you go there!"}
{"text":"I had a fabulous time bringing my mother here for the first time for lunch. She absolutely loved the ricotta filled pasta. I ended up eating off her plate it was so delicious! The service was great, we didn't have to wait long at all for our food. The second time I took my boss here we ended up sitting in the bar area because it was crowded. Unfortunately the service was sub par and irritatingly slow. The very very tan gentleman just.... didn't.... get... it. He took forever and a day to get items we asked for and he took even longer to get our bill. He only had to handle 3 tables. Luckily the food was great or I would have to knock the place down another star."}
{"text":"What has happened to this place? My husband and I went there Sunday afternoon...no  body greeted us or told be right there. I wish I would of left then...the place was dirty...no covers on electrical outlets, no tablecloth on our table...but other tables had them. The cooks looked so unprofessional with their backwards baseball caps on. The filters above the kitchen were laden with grease and dust. The food was lukewarm, but cold in spots. No flavor at all. Had to ask over and over for cream for lukewarm coffee. We used to really enjoy this place, the food was amazing...I should of went to Denny's...better food, service and quality"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. The food here is good, but the management is terrible. We brought a (good) bottle of wine to enjoy with our dinner. The server told us she couldn't open it. We asked to speak to a manager. She told us that they had a very good wine list and it was against the law to open the bottle. Since members in our party were in the industry they knew this was untrue (especially since we purchased one bottle also). Also she made no effort at a service recovery (we would've refused it anyway, but the effort would've been respectable). So terrible management ruined our meal."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I really like the atmosphere.  Although it is always ridiculously crowded, if you have reservations, getting in is no problem.  We had a large group (11) and were seated before our reservation which was nice but our table wasn't completely set up.  Not a big deal but when we all finally got seated they forgot to keep setting up the table, leaving some of us without place settings and me without a water for the first half of the meal which really annoyed me even though I asked 3 times.  It was super busy and the appetizers were delicious, so I forgave them.  I decided to go with a healthy option, the Shrimp Mediterranean because I wanted to be light plus I've never tried farro before.  It was quite good but since it was the healthy option, I was done super quick because there was so little.  I was not going to order dessert but when I came back from the bathroom the table had ordered for me and I was glad they did because the special caramel dessert cookie thing was amazing!

Food and atmosphere was on point, it was too loud though, and because of how busy it was, the service was lacking a little bit.  I do like how they have more options than their sister restaurant Bravo."}
{"text":"After a disappointing lunch at the near-by Cantina Laredo, my wife and I decided to try the Brio Tuscan Grill for dinner (and no, we don't normally eat out twice in one day. It was our anniversary, so we splurged).

Let me tell you, the Brio Tuscan Grille was the polar opposite of Cantina Laredo.

At the recommendation of our fabulous server Asia, we both started off with the lobster bisque. This was a thing of beauty. Rich, creamy and delightful, it was a meal in and of itself.

I had the Pasta Alla Vodka, a \"Delicate handmade pasta filled with Ricotta cheese, tossed with crispy prosciutto, garlic, basil and a Tomato Parmesan cream sauce\" (and no vodka...). $14.95. Asia suggested adding a grilled chicken breast, which complemented it very well (and wound up only be $2 more). 

My wife had Roasted Chicken & Butternut Squash Risotto, \"Sautéed with garlic, crispy prosciutto, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and basil\", also $14.95. I don't do squash, but the bride reported it was \"cooked to perfection\".

Despite the healthy portions and the rich food, we had to have the stupid desert tray brought over. Big mistake as they were impossible to pass up. We opted to share a Creme Brulee Dolchino Trio Sampler. These were served in little espresso cups and our sampler included caramel, vanilla bean, and banana foster varieties. This stuff is really good, and good for ya! All were fantastic, and the sampler size was more than adequate for both of us, especially after gorging on the pasta and bisque.

Service was impeccable and the atmosphere was great. 

Total bill for two, with two cocktails, two appetizers, two entrees and one desert was $67.67 (not including tip). 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with the family and decided too try Brio again since couple weeks ago the wait was too long for my brother guys my nieces. Happily not much of wait at all most part soon walked in got seated. They had live band playing outside that night outside on the patio. So the place had nice lively vibe too it especially around the patio/bar area. So I do need too come back because like the whole outdoor, open fire pit, and HH prices looks like steal. 

I came in for dinner with the family. We ordered two appetizers too share start artichoke spinach dip and calamari. Both really good. I enjoyed about the artichoke spinach dip was the fact it came with lavosh crackers rather then typical beard. It gave the dish another spin with the crispy lavosh topped with nice hot dip on top! It was nice creamy texture, vibrant green color, and great flavor. The calamari was solid nice crispy moist hot on in the inside comes with two different sauce one traditional marinade sauce and other not sure. Each sauce paired nice with the crispy calamari. Both were great starter before our entrees.

I had the chicken milanese. Break it down same as chicken parmesan. The chicken breast had perfect golden crust on the outside nice crispy and cooked perfectly on the inside! It was nice HOT and moist throughout! It served on bed of noodles cooked perfectly and saute with in some kind of butter sauce. Outside around the bed of pasta had red sauce. I really enjoyed everything on the plate nothing left too show!

The atmosphere feel like upscale version of Olive Garden. The prices are not that really upscale might be slightly more expensive then Olive Garden. It great alternative if looking for Italian food. The staff there from time walked in too our server all greeted us with smile, warm welcome, and fabulous job! If in the near the area would stop by again."}
{"text":"I am a frequent guest at Brio, as the food tastes very good and I really enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant. For me the best item on the menu is pasta alla vodka, which is handmade ricotta filled pasta with pancetta, garlic and basil in a spicy tomato Parmesan cream sauce. It is my favorite pasta all times and could eat it almost each time I visit the place and never get bored with it. I usually enjoy tasting various items from the menu in other restaurants, but pasta alla vodka is simply delicious and could never get enough of it. The only problem is that the dinner portion is exactly the same size that lunch portion, but more expensive... Slightly disappointing. 
And obviously I did try other dishes from their menu as well and all of them have nice fragrant flavors. So overall good food with solid service!"}
{"text":"Great food! Beautiful restaurant! Quick Service. Didn't want to leave!"}
{"text":"We hadn't dined here for a few years so decided to try it again.  It is still good.  I had the two plate lunch including the wedge salad and the pepperoni (etc) flatbread. It was good and reasonably priced. My wife had the chicken risotto with a Caesar side and liked it. One friend had the  chicken limone and enjoyed it a lot.  The other friend had the pesto chicken salad and liked it.  The wine list is adequate and reasonably priced. There are interesting drinks: mango iced tea and white peach Arnold Palmer as well as the Arnold Palmer.  All were enjoyed. 
Service was fine but there were long delays between drink orders and receipt of drinks and order of food and delivery of food. In addition, when a salad and entree were ordered they were served together rather than as separate courses.  That meant it was necessary to eat the entree before it cooled, then the salad.   I assume that is a bar/kitchen problem or a management decision. 
We sat on the patio. The chairs were uncomfortable which surprised me. Some places intentionally do this to discourage long term dining.  Not sure about this."}
{"text":"Love relaxing in the outside patio seating area and the happy hour menu is great! My fav drink here is the white peach sangria and I order an off the menu Steak Caesar Salad!"}
{"text":"They have yummy desserts!
My daughter's favorite dessert comes from here. She loves the creme brûlée from here. And my husband and I love the warm chocolate cake. We had just ate dinner at another place, so I order the 3 desserts to go. The estimated pickup time was 37 minutes. I thought that seemed long. 
I definitely enjoy these desserts better served in the restaurant. I had to build mine myself, which isn't a big deal. I also prefer the cake warm and it wasn't warm by time we got home. My daughter's didn't look picture perfect either. But was all still tasty. 
We will definitely order these desserts again."}
{"text":"I would never have come here to Brio if the work hadn't hosted lunch event.  I'll just call the pasta dishes serviceable and the presentation wonderful.  But the lobster bisque was amazing.  That was some good ass bisque.  The warm fresh bread that they brought out complemented the bisque.  I did hear some comments from co-workers that the there was less vegetarian options on the dinner menu vs. the lunch/brunch menu.   

I'm not going to compare it chains like Macaroni Grill or Olive Garden.  But I did like the ambiance and service was good.  I've never been to Tuscany but if it's all about the feast, Brio certainly is a good place to go for big groups if your in Town Square."}
{"text":"We only had drinks there since we arrived late and our friends were already done eating. Service was good and the waitress was very friendly. The drinks were good and I would consider returning in the future to try their food. They have $5 happy hour on weekdays too"}
{"text":"I took my mother out for a nice dinner anticipating a pleasant experience, instead it became the opposite.  We waited 10 minutes too long before our waitress Hollie came to serve us.  She never introduced herself and the only reason I know her name it is because it is stated on the ticket.  I asked her specifically if the spaghetti bolognese was an entree that we could order and if it was made the same as before she said yes it is.  We had put in 2 orders and it came out with a different kind of pasta.  The gentleman that brought it out to us explained to us that it is made differently now which Hollie never told us after I had asked her specifically if it was.  The waiter was kind enough to change the order for us and we got what we originally wanted.  Hollie never stopped by the table to apologize for the mistake, as a matter of fact she completely disappeared for the entire dinner until we were finished.  Only then she asked if our meal was ok.  She never checked on us and didn't offer any bread, which we had to ask for, or was around for us to get more water or drinks.  The worse part is that she wasn't friendly at all and if anything made it very unpleasant for us dine there and made us feel discriminated.  Employees like her shouldn't be in the hospitality industry and she is costing you money by not providing a great experience for your customers.  If we had a better service we would have gotten more drinks and stayed for dessert.  It is very unfortunate that she represents your company and that we could have gotten better service somewhere else.  The food is good as always but we won't be coming back to the Summerlin location."}
{"text":"Great service! From management my experience  was amazing when their was any issues general manager Jesse, was on top of it. He had great customer service as well as managing this fine Establishment . Overall, As a local in Las Vegas I recommend Bríos to anyone.

Thank you management!"}
{"text":"Came here for HH on Friday and had a pretty good time. No drink specials for HH, but they have a pretty decent appetizer menu with about 6 different things for $2.95. We ordered 3 appetizers, a glass of wine and a beer and paid only $20 before the tip. 

We had the spicy shrimp and eggplant (my favorite), the sliced steak bruschetta, and the sausage pepperoni and ricotta flat bread (minus the sausage). The flat bread was really thin more like a small thin crust pizza. These three appetizers alone would have cost us $35 at dinner. 

The service this time was great. We got our food in no time. The bartenders are super friendly and were always checking up on us and joking around. We'll definitely be back for happy hour."}
{"text":"The staff and decor are stuck in 2003 chain restaurant purgatory.  Stiff, unoriginal, and unreasonably stuffy given the level of restaurant Brio is.  The happy hour seemed popular so we tried it.  Kudos to the bartenders that sent perfect cocktails, but the servers tried to play the 'food from a frozen bag\" off as something special and unique.  It's a chain with a good happy hour deal and that's about it.  The dinner menu lists entrees for $25+.  I can't imagine how those would stand up to better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here quite often and really like it. The food is great and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Tivoli Village itself is a prettier side to the Las Vegas area. You can't go wrong :)"}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour with one of my good friends. As I entered the hostess at the stand asked me the basic seating questions once I informed her I was coming in for Happy Hour she changed her tone informed me that Happy Hour seating is at the bar or by the fire pit. 

As I walked around LOST the employees just continued to watch me walk back and fourth. I was alone still waiting on my friend and you can clearly see it in my expression that I couldn't find a seat. I had to ask someone for help who then also told me to look on the other side where there is another fire pit. Ok I get it, it's Happy Hour and seating is first come first serve but what's the point of having guest walk in and out feeling lost when you can have some type of organization to it?

Finally when I sat down it took about 10 minutes for someone to ask me what I wanted to drink and I guess they don't give you menus until you ask for one? This is the 4th time I have came here. It was my first time for Happy Hour and everytime I can't help but feel as if the staff be littles their guest. I clearly come back for the food and not the service! 

Happy Hour was definitely worth it! Great prices, good portions so as far as the quality in their food it's great! They need to work on better customer service skills. I have had better service at fast food restaurants then I've had here. It obviously wasn't a bad day for them cause 4 out of 4 tries the service just keeps getting worse."}
{"text":"Hosts were rude, literally had better service at IHOP this morning. Steak was so-so, waiter was decent."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried out Brio last week for date night and we were definitely impressed!  

Thankfully I was in a good mood or the lack of customer service at the very beginning would have soured my whole mood - I had forgotten the printed off copy of a coupon for a free appetizer that had been emailed to me, so I asked the waiter if there was anyway they could honor it if I showed them it on my phone.  After asking his manager, he said they had to have the paper copy to staple to the receipt and submit to corporate, or some garbage like that.  In my opinion, when I have told you this is our first visit, I have showed you the coupon... you go out of your way to accommodate me and make a good impression.  I imagine there is an office of sorts that they could probably print from at the restaurant - or the manager could just elect to give it to us complimentary anyway - but no.  I do not believe for a second that there was not a way they could do that for us, but decided not to ruin date night by complaining.  

Since I am complaining about management, I will throw out one more.  A manager stopped by our table, quite hurriedly, while we were both in the middle of chewing our food.  She asked how our dinner was then walked away without an answer because she didn't bother to wait until we had finished chewing, nor did she apologize for interrupting in the middle of a bite.  Did not really make me feel like she even cared how our meal was and irritated me that she interrupted our meal unnecessarily.  Mind you, this was a fairly early dinner and the restaurant was nowhere near full during our meal, steady, but not busy.  Now that I have complained here, I feel a little better and can move onto the food! :)

We started off with the Spicy Shrimp with Eggplant and I was very thoroughly impressed.  I could have eaten that as my meal (as long as I had several sides of bread to soak up the extra sauce). :)  If I were rating food individually, this dish could very well get Five Stars - maybe just shy of that.

The caesar salad was typical - nothing spectacular, nothing horrible.  That is about all there is to say about that.  Caesar Salar - Three Stars

For dinner we split the Tournedos di Manzo, and we were both very, very, very pleased.  Next time I will order it separately to get the steak cooked my way, instead of giving into the bf's preference.  It is just delicious.  Great flavor - love the Romano crusted tomato that it is served on and the Hollandaise pulls it together well without being over-powering.  Side veggies cooked perfectly!  Pushing Five Stars on this dish.

Given that we live so closely to Brio, it will likely become a regular spot for us, especially during happy hour!  Looking forward to round 2!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple of times and loved my food every time! Service is great, decor is absolutely beautiful inside. Next time I go I may choose to sit outside on the patio... overall great place! Loved the shrimp risotto special and the steak bruschetta."}
{"text":"I enjoy their happy hour, however I just don't like how you can only sit at the bar or inside booths for the town square location. I would say that their pastas are on the same taste level as cheesecake factory, around the same price but LESS then half the portion as cheesecake factory pasta portions. I normally like to take extra food home and I cant do that at Brio because their pasta portions are only enough for one sitting. very nice environment . Decent customer service , Always come here for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat with my family and friends. I've never been disappointed. Their food is well presented and very tasty. The restaurant is very nice on the inside an tastefully decorated. Great for a casual date or night out with the family."}
{"text":"I have visited this pleasant Italian place for lunch and dinner. My family and I discovered it on one of our many trips to Las Vegas. It is now a must stop whenever we go to LV. 
For the primi, we had the spinach artichoke dip and it was amazing! I am a huge fan of spinach and artichoke dip and this is definitely one of my favorite. 
The complimentary bread they give is also so good! They give you soft, warm bread, and cripsy flatbread with balsamic vinegar and wine...oh so good. I would just go for this!
Their caesar salad and Brio chopped salad was good, nothing really special, but they both did taste very good.
I had the Chipotle Chicken & Bacon Panini with charred tomato, carmelized onions, spicy chipotle mayonnaise, Fontina, Boursin and Applewood bacon. The Bacon was superb! The sandwich overall was perfect! I would get this next time I go to lunch.
For dinner, I had the Grilled Salmon. I am also a fan of salmon, and the salmon was cooked to perfection for me. It came with Romano crusted tomatoes, citrus pesto, asparagus and crispy shoestring potatoes. 
For dessert, I had their tiramisu. It was okay, nothing worth mentioning about it. 
The service was great both times I went and I loved the decor around the entire restaurant most of all. It really made me feel like I was in another world, not just in another LV restaurant. 
If you go to Las Vegas, this is a must try for some good Italian food and not as expensive as on the strip. Plus, you can shop and walk around the Town Square afterwards :)"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming to this restaurant since it opened. The food is delicious and the service is good. On our last visit, however, the service  was exceptional. Our waiter,  Aaron was extremely attentive, never once did we have to wait for a drink refill or ask for anything. He even offered to go cups for our drinks. This gentleman gives 5 star service. I will be sure to ask for him on our next visit."}
{"text":"Over priced pasta dishes and horrible service. Happy hour is the only hour I'll return to this place and only because I'm out voted by friends."}
{"text":"Pretty good for Summerlin restaurant. Been to the one at Town square. Service very nice a little short handed. It must have been homecoming for local high schools. Really like the short ribs."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed!  I have been to Happy Hour at the Summerlin location a couple of times and enjoyed the appetizer menu and the prices. Thought it would be a nice place to take my friend for her birthday.  I made reservations the day before for the 2 of us. When I arrived (early)  I told the hostess that I was there and would let her know when my friend showed up. I told her it was my friend's birthday and asked it they did anything special. She said \"Oh yes!  She would post it on her reservation list.\"  

When she seated us It was on time at 8:00PM on Wednesday night and the place was not the least bit crowded.  In fact it was very slow.  I asked her if I could see their brunch menu.  She said that it was just their regular menu. I have seen others post on here about their eggs benedict and other \"brunch\" items\".  hmmm. Maybe I just missed it on the regular menu. I wasn't planning on ordering anything from that menu, but wanted to consider it for a later occasion.

When the waiter came, he was very gracious. He asked if we wanted any appetizers before dinner. I told him that I would like the bruschetta. NEVER GOT IT! I also ordered the lobster bisque and it was excellent. 

My friend ordered the 7 ounce steak and said that it was very good.  I ordered the \"Pasta Brio\".  I have had better at Applebees. Seriously!  

I had also seen on this site that some had raved about their bread basket and how wonderful their rolls were..  We didn't get a bread basket. I had to ask another waiter for it. It arrived with just little slices of some kind of toast - No rolls. 

My wine was a 4 ounce glass of Cabernet. $13. THIRTEN Dollars!!! It was decent, but certainly not worth $13.  Hey this is not a Strip destination spot.  It's an upscale locals restaurant (At least I thought so.)

I may come back for Happy Hour, but doubt if I eat dinner here again, Highly overpriced menu.  

PS: Didn't have anything for a birthday - no dessert or anything. 
This is the only review for a restaurant I have ever written."}
{"text":"Went here for desert, Matt, our server was such a huge help in choosing! He did a fantastic job, was so sweet too! Best cheesecake ever!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment 4 times in the past 3 years.  My last visit I walked in wondering why I don't come here more often.  By the time I left it was clear.  

We will start with the pros first.  The place is beautiful.  The hostess has always been wonderful and we have been seated right away regardless of wether or not we had a reservation.  

The food is good, not great.  I don't think it's worth the price they are asking.  The last time I got the Pasta Alla Vodka and water.  My bill was $24.  

Service is not good.  Two times I came with big groups so I can understand service being slower.  One time was happy hour and service was much better in the bar area.  My last visit the service was horrible.  I did a whole lot of waiting, while the staff was standing around.  One staff member was leaning against a wall with his eyes closed.  Can't see that I'm waiting to pay that way!"}
{"text":"My wife took me there yesterday 01/17/2018 for my birthday and it started out rocky. My wife had made a reservation for 1pm. We showed up a few minutes early checked in and we were told to take a seat. After watching the hostess seat 3 seperate groupd of walk-ins, and about 15 minutes later, a totally different hostess asked us if we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive. I explained that we were not, we had a reservation. She looked embarassed and sat us immediately. As we walked in and saw several empty tables, I was not happy. Next, the bus person brought a basket of bread but no plates. After a few minutes I got up and grabbed 2 plates off of an empty table. Finally when our waiter, Julio, got the ball rolling it went smoother. We ordered a flatbread pizza for an app and the Pasta Brio for our main course. The Executive Chef took the time to personally bring us fresh warm bread and ask us about the food. Julio brought us out a complimentary piece of the marscapone cheesecake with a candle for my birthday. The excellent food made up for the piss-poor first impression. More training and oversight in those areas is much needed. They just were'nt that busy. That's why they get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, tasty food, and solid presentation all make for a reliable \"go-to\" spot when hunger strikes.  My strawberry and spinach salad was appetizing and colourful and hubby's pasta was savoury and rich.  Everything was served with a (genuine) smile and we enjoyed our time feasting and people watching."}
{"text":"I ended up coming here 2 days in a row for various reasons.

The first time I came here it reminded me of a restaurant that you would see in Las Vegas. Nice decor and clean -  just made me wish I was dressed up and inebriated though.

The food is pretty good -- I've had their chicken sandwich and salad. The portions are huge -- even their plates and forks are huge....why? 

Don't think I would come here again by choice, but I certainly wouldn't mind if I ended up here again :)"}
{"text":"My first visit here involved waiting an hour and fifteen minutes to be seated and a waiter spilling red wine on me. But you know what? I had such a great time; none of it even mattered! 

It was girls' night out with my pregnant best friend from high school. We had some catching up to do. Our waitress, Amanda, was so much fun!  She kept us laughing and entertained. She mentioned that she was not on the floor that often but that she really enjoyed it. I'll give her credit; she is the best waitress I've ever had anywhere, hands down. She is fabulous.

I really wish I could remember the names of the plates we tried. We had a spicy pasta, pizza, and spinich artichoke dip. The food was fantastic! 

The manager came over and apologized profusely for the mishap with the wine. She gave me her card and told me to bring in my dry cleaning receipt and the restaurant would reimburse me. Eh, clothes can easily be replaced. I was not going to let spilled wine ruin my night.  I really appreciate her offer, though, I won't be dry cleaning my jeans. They ended up comping our entire meal!  It was appreciated but definitely not necessary as I wasn't upset at all. We were so incredibly grateful.

Overall, great experience. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Request Alex as your server. He is awesome!! Four stars only because our tiramisu was a bit still frozen. Food was great otherwise. Alex made it a total dining experience! Thank you helping us celebrate our girls accomplishments."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Breakfast!! The elegance of Brio started off my day with ease. The host staff was welcoming and cordial. We had a reservation and we were seated within minutes so no real waiting. 

I got to enjoy Berries & Cream stuffed French toast with applewood bacon. It was a bit overwhelming due to how sweet it was but what do you expect with stuffed French toast drizzled with honey and syrup. Nonetheless, it was yummy!!! 

The service was ok. I felt like our server was getting irritated a couple times but then he would snap out of it. I get they were super busy so I just let it slide. 

I have enjoyed happy hour at this venue many times and have always had a great time. Overall, still a satisfied Brio customer!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a chain restaurant. Great Thursday night wine specials! Brios is much better than Olive Garden, Carrabas and Macaroni Grille."}
{"text":"My mom and I had lunch there after doing some shopping at San Tan Village. We both thought it was really unfortunate that their good food was offset by bad service. We had to wait forever for our drink orders. I had to flag down someone else because it'd been about 20 minutes and we hadn't even gotten water! My Mom's appetizer plate turned out to be dirty (so maybe three stars is a little generous:), I find that unacceptable anywhere, let alone a place that's not exactly cheap. 

But the food was good. My shrimp and mom's salmon were tasty and had a delish combination of flavors going. We might give it another try, although with so many restaurants around why settle for a chance you might get same bad service?"}
{"text":"We ate here on Saturday, March 10 around 5:30 PM. The coffee was cold, the striped sea bass was undercooked and the manager neither apologized nor did he take anything off the bill. He told us that was the way the chef intended it to be served. We do not eat fish that is still translucent in the center and slimy. 

We sent back the coffee and both entrées. They misunderstood my boyfriend and brought him another Sea Bass entrée which he felt was average to below-average. He didn't want to wait for another entrée to be ordered so he went ahead and ate the meal. 

I ordered a new meal - the salmon and it was average to below-average. It was still a bit undercooked for my tastes, but we were now running late so I did not have time to reorder or be fussy. The second cup of coffee was freshly brewed and it was hot.

We sat outside in the patio area - on the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever sat on in a restaurant. My legs were numb before we were even served. We would have moved inside but the evening was so beautiful we wanted to enjoy the fresh air.  The chairs must have been chosen for their looks because they were cute but obviously no one cared to try them out before purchasing them.

I have to admit that the decor inside is beautiful and the chairs inside are comfortable.

I have spoken to several people who have had very similar experiences at this restaurant. We will not be eating at this restaurant again due to the horrible food and very poor customer service on the manager's part. 

With how long it took to order and reorder everything it put us behind for the events of the evening."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Service was professional, clean, and prompt. We arrived around 730 and seated immediately. Very yummy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, and an even better happy hour with dishes starting at $3.95, great place to come in a group and share there happy hour tapas. I enjoyed the spinach artichoke dip and the black pepper shrimp. We had a great server, Justin, great customer service! And to top it all off, the tiramisu... Words cant explain how delicious it was. It is very affordable during happy hour however the regular menu is a bit more pricy"}
{"text":"First time here on a whim for lunch with my friend and her daughter.

Customer service rocked. Loved that our waiter was honest and told us the girls could share one kids meal because the portion is so large. Guess what?! He was right. The girls couldn't even finish it with splitting it. They got Mac n cheese which was extremely cheesy goodness. Thick not runny and I made sure to steal a bite... Hey I had to make sure it wasn't poisoned right!? ;)

Us moms decided upon something light and refreshing since everything on the menu looked heavy. Soup and salad it was. The salad was just okay, the dressing was good. Some type of vinaigrette. It was chopped into tiny pieces with feta cheese, tomatoes, black olives, cucumber an romaine lettuce. Very large. Then the soup was lobersterlicious!! Aka, lobster bisque. Oh my god, I cannot stop raving about it. Creamy, buttery, lobster goodness. It was rich, and delicious. Large portion again. I downed that sucker almost licking the bowl. I will come just for that, for sure!!"}
{"text":"Im always excited to go to the Brio at town square because it's fun and full of people. I'm never excited about this Tivoli location and I'm not sure why.  The food is the same and it looks nice. I think it's just the quieter vibe of Tivoli village.
Also once u eat at Brio there isn't much else to do here at Tivoli.
At town square there are so many shops, bars restaurants and the theater to visit."}
{"text":"The food was great. Our waiter Ted was fantastic. The entire staff went above and beyond and this is the reason why we are regulars. 

Brio 4 Life!"}
{"text":"Overpriced. Overrated. I ordered a 5 oz steak with mashed potatoes and asked if I could sub grilled asparagus for the steamed vegetables. This dish was $22 and they charged me extra for the asparagus. The plate looked like it was completely empty. The steak, smaller than my palm. The asparagus I was charged extra for, was undercooked and bland. I asked for Dr Pepper, received Coke and then when I finally tacked down my second server of the night due to a shift change that left us completely neglected, the Dr Pepper was flat and watered down. My boyfriend liked his sweet potato Risotto, but the serving size was also very small. It's loud, freezing, and an overall unenjoyable place. Wouldn't ever come here again. Huge waste of money and an afternoon."}
{"text":"For my 200th review I am choosing Brio Tuscan Grille.
First let me say that it is a beautiful building , looks just like a Villa in Italy to me. The colors are just what they should be.
Inside is beautifully decorated, and wonderful music is always playing. 
The restrooms are very clean and nice.
We were seated at a corner tablefor 4,it was perfect. The nice thing is the have a waist high wall built around it ,so even though you are on the corner you are not bothered.
It is really a relaxing setting. I enjoyed lunch very much.
I have had their food before,because they have catered a few events I have been lucky enough to go to. Always good!

Our waiter was Demetrius, he was very good,until he got busy,then he was a little frazzled. He gave us the wrong check twice, but things happen and it was the day after Christmas. So it was very busy.
The food was wonderful as always. T got the Crab cakes and Italian Wedding soup, delish! I got Chicken with pasta and lobster Bisque. Outstanding!!!
We will be back,I wish we could go again this week.
Lots of parking in the great FREE parking garage.

The more I come over here ,the more I like it!
Oh and do not forget to get your reward card.Every time you come in you get points for dining here. Which adds up to free food."}
{"text":"awesome late night patio and service. This is becoming my goto place for late night entertaining. I have come here handful of times, and each time was great. Love the bread and butter. Sitting on the patio is most enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! I had the grilled salmon with asparagus and fried tomato. It tasted fantastic. They also have a unique thin bread which is almost like a big cracker that they serve you before your meal comes out, I am a big fan of this bread. I also had the caesar salad and lobster bisque before my meal. The bisque was some of the best I have ever tried. Also, our waitress Cathy was very nice and helpful. Great service, great food!"}
{"text":"This is a good place ... I have not had a bad meal here yet. ... beware get reservations they are very busy. The steak is really good and the salmon. The pasta is really good as well but what i remember the most was this wine called the sketchbook ... was awesome so smooth. Service is great even when they are so busy."}
{"text":"I have never dined in the restaurant, i've only been here for happy hour in the bar.  I've been here multiple times and i have to say it is an exceptional deal. I've had everything off the happy hour menu and its extremely fresh and still pretty big portions. The only thing I wish was them having a better beer selection, but I can not complain because their food makes up for it.  So stop by after work and enjoy a nice fresh happy hour meal.  3:30-6:30 is the happy hour time!"}
{"text":"Brio was the perfect choice for our goodbye dinner before my husband traveled to Italy. The casual atmosphere was great for our kids and we loved the free appetizer with the Yelp check in. My daughter loved the Chicken Milanese and I enjoyed the light Shrimp Verduta. The Bisteca Insalade was a meal unto itself, but I would not include Brio in the category of Italian restaurants that gives you portions far too large for anyone to finish. They were busy and a few times we waited for our server, but overall we would recommend it."}
{"text":"I love this place i love the food the service and mose of a the wonderful atmosphere of the place thay always make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"I love Italian - Armani, Dolce and Gabbana, Prada, Fendi, Missoni, but......

I must admit, I'm not a fan of chain Italian restaurants. I was raised by a real Italian mama and nothing comes close to her sauce, her meatballs, her pasta dishes. I am terribly critical of most Italian restaurants and therefore am very hard to please. 

I will say that Brio Tuscan Grille has thoroughly impressed this Italian palate. I avoided it like the plague when it opened at Town Square, but when it opened at Tivoli I decided to give Brio a chance. One chance!

Well it turned out one chance was all it needed because Brio knocked my Italian socks off. 

The pasta alla vodka was tremendous, with ricotta stuffed pasta in a cheesy cream sauce. The top was sprinkled with pancetta and basil and the dish was large enough to bring some home for lunch.

A friend ordered the lasagna and it was huge - seriously enough for two people.

On my most recent visit, we decided to hit the bar before heading over for some wine tasting. What a treat we found in that bar....in the form of a $2.95 menu!!! Wow, it was awfully tasty, and with such selections as ravioli caprese, shrimp and eggplant (EXCELLENT) and a gigantic burger. Oh and Wednesday is Martini night - $5 martinis -- yippee!!!!

Good food, good service, good prices. Seriously, what's not to love?"}
{"text":"Form the hostess to the server, everyone was very friendly. Now, THE FOOD was bananas! MY girl & I had the Lobster bisque to start,\"Now I have had my fair share of bisque but this will go up there on 1 of my top 3 for sure\" I forgot what my girl had but whatever it was it was great. AS fo me...I had the Surf & Turf. REALLY GOOD but the portion was a little small. Never the less, our experience was great & I would highly recommend it to anyone.
Why did'nt I rate it a 5 star...I'm a stickler for having our drinks filled at all times..even if it's just water,\"which I was drinking\". But in our servers defense, she was very busy & had a large section. 
Maybe next time they will bump up to a 5 Star."}
{"text":"Love the presentation of the dishes,  the quality and freshness! The happy hour it's amazing."}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me to dinner on my birthday at this location on 04/27/17 for what was supposed to be a very special day and occasion, but instead it was a terrible experience!! I had a horrible birthday and the absolute worst experience that I've ever had at any establishment. When we immediately entered there were three young hostesses just standing around chitchatting, we stood there for a few seconds before we were even greeted. Finally after their \"worthy\" conversation was over we were greeted and escorted to our table. We were seated with no silverware, the waiter came over, took our drink orders, and we ordered an appetizer and also got served the appetizer without any silverware. We didn't receive silverware until my girlfriend walked up to the hostess stand to request the silverware. It became immediately obvious that our waiter was just not having a good night and was overwhelmed. The service that he provided was horrible, he didn't take the time to check on us after we got our food, and we had to wave for him to see that we needed a refill on our drinks. I ordered my favorite dish and it seemed as if they were either low on ingredients or that they had served me the leftovers from another diner's plate. The portion was very small and on all my other visits I had never seen such a small portion of this dish, which was my favorite dish to order. Prior to arriving at the restaurant my girlfriend had also called to advise them that it was my birthday and she requested a birthday dessert. While at the restaurant she even notified the hostesses and requested for them to please notify our waiter that it was my birthday and once again requested the birthday dessert. Needless to say the message wasn't relayed to our waiter and all he brought to our table was the check. Finally fed up with the terrible customer service we requested to speak to a manager and the manager Megan came over. Prior to her coming over to speak with us we were disappointed with the lack of communication and poor service, but not too upset. However, Megan absolutely added fuel to the fire and made the night and my special occasion even worst. She was very sarcastic and EXTREMELY dismissive of our concerns and complaints. Her solutions to the issues were her sarcastic jokes & remarks, a very poor attempt at an apology, and a free dessert card. The experience was terrible and truly was the absolute worst dining experience and attempt at celebrating my special day. Prior to this experience everyone who knows me knew that Brio was my favorite restaurant in town and that I would visit this location 6-8 times yearly, and even ordered catering to go orders for events at work, but based on this experience and especially the way that we were treated by Megan I will NEVER again visit this restaurant or any other location. I've already deleted the rewards app with unused rewards because the experience was so bad that I truly will never ever visit any Brio restaurant ever again. Great job guys... the ball was completely dropped on this night! Worst experience ever!!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love brio. The reason being behind this is because everytime I come to eat here, the quality they bring out to me is great. We usually come here for an occasion, or for lunch happy hour because their pricing is a little expensive.

I always end up getting some sort of pasta, with a nice sauce. I love their ravioli pasta and chicken limon! 

Customer service wise, I've gotten the good, the bad and the in between. Although, our last experience here was actually not so bad. I believe our server might've been new, so she didn't seem like she knew everything on the menu when we asked her about some entrees. It was my friends birthday, so we asked her to bring a surprise cake out for him, or something cute to surprise him. After a few minutes, she comes to our table and asks us who's birthday it is and what kind of cake he would want. He had no idea, and sort of laughed. But instead of just bringing one out to surprise him, she kind of ruined the surprise. But I guess things happen, but it would have been nicer to surprise him. Next time, I'll be sure to make myself clear. LOL"}
{"text":"The first time I went here, I was with my best friend. We went there for happy hour. We were told that happy hour is only at the bar. The bar area is inside the restaurant and  outside. The happy hour menu is only a page just one sided. Even though the selection is small the food is delicious. The plates are good enough to fill you up with just 2-3 plates.

The second time I went there I went with my boyfriend. We went on a thursday. Also went there for happy hour. When we sat down, I noticed a $5 martinis only on thursdays. 

The price for the happy hour food is $3.95 for every single plate on the happy hour menu. 
The service is good. But the first time I went there, it was ok. We had to ask our waitress to get refills on our water."}
{"text":"This a main staple at Town Square and very popular at peak times. Expect a short to moderate wait if you want a table. We walk right past all of the people to the bar area where we always find a spot for 2. If there's no seating at the bar on the inside we sit outside. 
The food is always great and the staff is usually pretty good. They bring the traditional bread before the meal. 
My favorite meal of all time is the Parmesan crusted beaf medallions. It has a slightly different name now because the crust is different but it tastes the same."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in Vegas!!! 3.95$ small plates, Bill is 30$ ate, drank, great atmosphere, thank you Brio, you never disappoint. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Sadly, we squandered over $200 on what we thought would be a fine dining experience for our family.

Service: FIVE STARS
-  Lindsay was our server.  She was personable and very professional. 

Ambiance:    TWO STARS
-  We were seated in the dome area; it looked tired, dingy and absolutely lacking in energy and excitement. The chairs were uncomfortable.

Food:  ONE STAR
-  Several meals were served; my personal experience pretty much covers it all.  The strip steak I had was nothing to write home about; it lacked that \"grilled\" flavor you would expect of a steak being served in a fine dining establishment. Portion-wise- it was a decent size. The accompanying mashed potatoes were hot and cold, suggesting they were microwaved. Their texture was like the flour and water you used to make a paper mâché project in elementary school. As for flavor, well let's just say they did not even come close to being a \"fine dining\" entree; even KFC delivers a better mashed potato. The veggies were worse! My veggies were so overcooked, they reminded me of the shriveled aliens you see in sci-fi movies. Visually, they were simply gross looking.  Thankfully, their flavor was better, but not by much.  Definitely not a \"fine food\" entree!

OVERALL DINING EXPERIENCE:  Double thumbs dow."}
{"text":"Really delicious meal and excellent service.  We tried the bruschetta sampler and the BLT was my favorite.  Salads, pasta and dessert and all was delicious!  

It was not a very intimate setting, it was very open and we were smack in the middle of the restaurant.  That would be my only complaint."}
{"text":"Being a local this is a one of my favorite places to go. The chopped salad and Brussels sprouts are amazing. They have a great happy hour during the week and the drinks are flowing! It is sometimes hard to find a seat at the bar but usually only have to wait 10mins. The bar tending staff is great! Delmar is one of my favs. The bathrooms are always clean and never dirty. I love the outside sitting area when it's warmer out especially with the fire pits."}
{"text":"Although I must have been sat in the worst seat in the house, the atmosphere in this Brio was still excellent. My guest and I were seated right after a supremely difficult woman, the type that just makes a fuss about everything. This made for some interesting dinner conversation, to say the least, and the staff seemed to handle her well. Certainly better than I could have! I came to the conclusion throughout dinner that our waiter was not supposed to be taking care of our section but was just picking up the slack for another waiter or trying to get some extra tables. Even despite this, I am certain I will be back.

First off, the bread is sourdough! Any restaurant that has a default option of sourdough bread, sign me up. I had the lobster and shrimp fettucini and a chopped salad. Other Yelpers don't lie when they praise the chopped salad here! The shrimp and lobster pasta was as good as any I have ever head but still when I come back I think I will order a chopped salad. On the menu it is $5 and comes as a side, so maybe order two and ask them to combine it into a bowl. I am honestly surprised there is no entree option for this salad but I guess most people don't come to an Italian restaurant to have their cheapest salad option. It is that good though, so do yourself a favor and order it!"}
{"text":"I came here twice for dinner while home for the holidays and enjoyed my experience. I can't say enough good things about the service here at Brio! Each time I came, the hostess and servers were attentive, friendly, helpful, and kind. They really went above and beyond to make our dinner a great one.

The food was just okay. I ordered the Surf and Turf (steak with grilled shrimp) and the shrimp were delicious! The steak on the other hand was over salted and a little hard to eat because it was just so. freakin. salty. My dad ordered the crab meat and shrimp crusted salmon and it was amazing. 

The second time I went, I ordered the lobster and shrimp fettuccine. It was again, oversalted. When I cook I generally make food more flavorful and saltier compared to friends and family so for me to say it's salty REALLY means that it was salty. Again, it was hard to finish because I was being overloaded with salt.

I'd come back, but I'd probably order something like the salmon."}
{"text":"My fiance and I have eaten here twice now. The first time was for our anniversary last year. The service was excellent and the food (lobster stuffed ravioli and 8oz center cut filet) was fantastic! This past Mother's Day (which also fell on the same day as my fiance's birthday) we had 7:00pm reservations. We arrived fifteen minutes early and were seated around 6:55pm. The service was friendly and fairly quick (for a busy Mother's Day). We ordered the shrimp and lobster fettuccine and the shrimp and lobster crusted salmon. We also shared a lobster bisque and small wedge style salad appetizer and a glass of wine each. While the salmon was quite tasty, the fettuccine was dry and bland. The noodles all stuck together as if they were either under or overcooked. As a result, my fiance simply ate the shrimp out of the dish. At this time my fiance and I agreed we would not be back again based on the fact that the prices were quite high for a bland dish. Prior to paying the bill we decided to inform the manager (Chad if I remember correct) about the poor food quality. The manager was very nice and apologized several times. After declining his offer to prepare us another dish to take to go, our bill came. The manager had removed the dish from the bill without telling us. My fiance and I were pleased to see this. At this time the waitress offered us a desert on the house in an effort to remedy the situation. We declined this as well as we already had plans to get Gelato next door (FYI, Frost serves some of the best Gelato I've ever had!). As we collected our things and headed for the exit, we were met again by the manager. He handed my fiance an enveloped gift card and apologized again. The gift card was substantial enough to pay for both of our meals if we return. 

Both my fiance and I left the establishment shocked that the manager went so far out of his way to ensure we left satisfied. Based on the customer service and our past experience I'd recommend this place to my friends and family and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have discovered that although Tivoli has shops with price tags that make me want to cry, it actually offers a pretty wide selection of reasonable places to eat. Usually we go to Leone, but today I wanted to try Brio because I was craving pasta. 

The ravioli di bello was the perfect dish to satisfy that craving. I wish I had taken better note of what was in it, but basically it was cheesy mushroom ravioli with sautéed mushrooms and a chardonnay (it might have been some other wine) cream sauce. Yum yum yum yum yum. The flavors were developed very well, and it was indulgent without making me want to take a nap. Most of the items on the menu were within the $15-20 range, so you can have a meal with some friends and not break the bank. 

Our waiter was a little pushy when it came to add-ons like appetizers and desserts but it really wasn't that big of a deal. I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"really hard to go wrong with Brio. great food, the staff is always very pleasant to deal with even when they are super busy and you know they must be stressed"}
{"text":"Good food, service is excellent.  A bit pricey for lunch, but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"I don't usually like eating at \"chain\" restaurants or posting reviews for them. But, as far as \"chain\" restaurants go, Brio has some really great menu items. And out of the restaurant choices at town square, Brio is up at the top of the list and definitely not somewhere you should ever avoid (avoid Claim Jumper!). 

Brio has wonderful flat breads and bruchetta. Yum. Last night, I ordered the pasta alla vodka and OHMYGOD, I ate the entire plate. Literally, I ate the entire plate. I can't even tell you details about the type of pasta because I shoveled into my mouth so fast that I'm almost in a state of memory failure. All I know is the sauce, the pasta, and the prosciutto were SO DELICIOUS and a must-order if you like vodka sauce. 

I also really love the fresh bread they bring to the table, particularly the cheesy cracker-like pieces! YUMMY! 

They have a really great selection of desserts too: small ones that allow you to sample many different flavors. I really enjoyed the creme brulee!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here last Sunday around 7:30 pm. We were shocked that there was no wait, it was actually pretty empty on a Sunday night.  The host sat us down and we waited and waited and waited... They were fully staffed with an empty restaurant and not 1 person came to check on us not even offer us water.. After about 15 minutes of waiting and numerous waitress and waiters passing by us with NO acknowledgment we got up and walked out... No one asked why, where or what happened. So I can't really rate the food, nor the water since we didn't get any service... This 1 star is for VERY poor customer service."}
{"text":"Came here for the late night happy hour last Monday, which is from 9 pm to close, and no surprise it wasn't very crowded at all. We had mostly drinks but ordered a couple appetizers too including the margherita flatbread. Everything on the happy hour menu is priced between $4-$6 and the drinks seemed decently strong. The flatbread was nice and crunchy and a pretty good size. Service was efficient and our server kept coming back to check on us the entire time we were there. Our food and drinks came out pretty fast. I was impressed and would definitely come back to check out their full menu"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! I was introduced to them because of a Yelp event held there recently but I loved it. The patio front and side are awesome. Now that the weather is getting a little cooler here - I can't wait to go there and participate in one of my all-time favorite pastimes ... drinks on the patio! It's a perfect venue. The parking garage is right across from the entrance. So easy! Oh, and the food was wonderful as well :)"}
{"text":"Food is great at brunch yet for dinner I couldn't tell you how it is - it took 30 minutes to get water and iced tea.  We got bread but no silverware.  I had to steal some from a table next to us when they got up and left due to lack of service.  Now 1 hour into my time at this table - still no appetizer and my butt is hurting because this chair is too small for my American ass.  My server had a table walk out on him... I wonder why?  Brio is a great place to hang out for happy hour and brunch but avoid dinner service as it takes way too long and the meals are the same size portions as lunch for a higher price."}
{"text":"Took us 1-1/2 hours to get our food. Arrived on a Sunday night at 5:30 p.m. with reservations. Was impressed to be seated right away. That was the last time we were impressed. Food didn't come until 7 p.m.! We had two waitresses and they didn't come back to refill drinks until just before 7 p.m. when the food came out. The food ranged from very good to ok. The people who had pasta dishes said their pasta was cold. The people who had meat had a warm dish. The bread wasn't warm. Not impressive. I have no reason to go back."}
{"text":"Oh Brio.  I try so hard to enjoy dining there because the food is amazing.  Keep in mind, I'm a bit biased because typically I frequent Brio during happy hour.

First, let's talk about Happy Hour. A plenitful variety of appetizers (including a full size burger) for $2.95.  Budget friendly?  That would be a yes.  I've also eaten at their sister company Bravos quite a few times, and everything I ever had off the menu was AMAZING.  

But good food only gets you so far with me.  What's an instant ratings killer?  Oh right, Bad service. 

Now granted, I eat at Brio quite a bit because it happens to be located near my place of employment, so because of that I tend to frequent their Happy Hour specials on my lunch hour.  Just the food portion though.  Drinking during my lunch would be a little more than frowned upon.  

So I'm not sure if it's because I typically dine alone, or they know I work in the vicinity of the restaurant, or it's because I never consume alcoholic beverage in the bar area when I'm on my lunch, but the service has gone from decent to mediocre to abysmal.

My review is based on my previous visit.  So I'm sitting at the bar during happy hour and it's actually quite a slow day, meaning lots of empty bar stools.  I come in, sit down, and no exactly what I want.  The gentleman beside me gets his food right as I'm sitting down and apparently knows the one of the many...I think at one point I counted 5 people working behind the bar.....bartenders.  She inquires about his food, glances at me....and WALKS AWAY.  Ok, maybe she was distracted.  5 minutes later- no one has even acknowledged my presence, let alone taken my order.  So I sit patiently wondering what the deal is when one of the bartenders notices I haven't been waited on and asks how she can help me.  Afraid that no one is going to come in my direction again, I place my food and drink order all once.  Meanwhile, the guy to my left is displeased with one of his dishes and gets it removed from his bill.

So my food comes, it's tasty as always, but water at this point is empty.  After being finished with my food for well over 5 minutes, the bartender from before comes over...glances right at my empty water glass... and asks if I'm ready for the check.  

So let's briefly discuss the number one way to piss me off at a restaurant- oh that's right, an empty drink.

So at this point, I pay my tab and bolt.  And haven't been back since."}
{"text":"I've dined here quite a few times. The food has always been good. I'm writing this review because recently I tried the white peach sangria. Let me just say order this!! It's fabulous and everything a summer sangria should be. Do yourself a favor and order it, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially when we have nice weather here in Vegas. In the summer they let you sit outside and they turn on the misters for you. But we went on a beautiful Sunday afternoon for some LUNCH! and we were hungry! 

I usually always get the pastas, but my girlfriend had the crab and shrimp cakes which were really good. I had the pasta brio which was good, from what I remember. And my friend Vanessa had the grilled salmon angel hair pasta.

Its a nice quiet atmosphere, and its always nice to walk around town square after. 

Good place to take someone on a date. 

MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night, we waited over 10 minutes to be greeted by our server. I know they were busy but everyone was just constantly running. I feel like they were under staff. Our server never offered more bread, only came by once to see if everything was okay and even forgot to split our order. It took him a while to come back to drop the check at the end. Overall very frustrating experience even though the food was good."}
{"text":"It is kind of pricy but totally worth it! I love their patio and their salads are amazing. The staff is very polite and actually gives you space and time to eat."}
{"text":"Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip

Lobster Bisque
Sauteed shrimp garnish 6.95

Braised Beef Pappardelle
Rosemary pappardelle, crimini mushrooms, roasted carrots, red onions, tomato porcini sauce 17.95

My wife and I came here after a rainy night shopping at the south outlets. First off, this place looks like a more elegant \"big sister\" of Bravo Cucina Italiana (see previous review) with the brightly lit ambience. The menus are quite similar also Portions are quite generous as my wife and I shared everything. The dip was pretty good and the bread that came with it were pretty big. The bisque was ok as it had more of a butter flavor than lobster flavor. The lobster bisque at Top of the World in the Stratosphere tasted way better. The pasta was pretty good as it pretty much tasted like a pot roast with long, thick egg noodles. Our waitress/chefs were nice enough to give us 2 divided plates of the dish. Overall, we had a good experience here and we'll try it again if we are in Towns Square...Oh yeah, we had a lot of leftovers and they still tasted good."}
{"text":"Stellar customer service, in this city these days, say what?!!  It's true folks, Tivoli- Brio blew me away with their attentiveness and spectacular customer service during my dinner last night.

Greeted by two perky hostesses the (I assume) Manager escorted my date and I to our table.  Before we could even place the cloth napkins on our laps our server was at our table kindly taking our drink orders.  

Sifting through the menus placed on the table, wine list, dinner menu, I stumbled upon the GLUTEN FREE menu! Yes, a special menu just for me.. My excitement continued when I browsed the decent list of gluten free options, including pasta.  Fellow allergy sufferers would agree that most restaurants name their basic protein dishes their \"gluten free option's\"..pause while I yawn.. But I digress.

I thoroughly enjoyed my Cesar salad with CRISP, fresh Romain lettuce, dressed to perfection. My taste buds were then taken on a gluten free amazing pasta trip that was out of this world..

Two glasses of wine and a full belly later, this girl was a happy diner.  The manager checked on our table while we dined, bussers were exceptionally attentive clearing plates promptly, and our server was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive as well.

All in all I give this Brio (2) very solid thumbs up.  I sincerely hope they keep up the above average customer service and delicious gluten free menu options.

West Side, should we meet again and I am in the mood for Italian food, Brio you're at the top of my list!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. In fact it has been a favorite of ours that we look forward to.  Menu has changed, everything is now more expensive and they charge for side dishes as well as salads.  Honestly if I am paying 22.00 for a chicken dinner, throw in the salad dont make me pay 4.50 for it.  That is ridiculous.  Ate here last weekend and not a good experience, food was cold by the time I got it, We had to wait another 20 minutes to have my dinner remade, I thought food was supposed to be served immediately when it was done.  This place is not dong that puttying folks at risk for food born illness.  After my meal was served, and second time around at least it was hot we did order tirimesu for dessert, smallest little slice of cake I have ever seen.  They are really trying to maximize their profit."}
{"text":"I don't know if it was the company or what.  After reading the reviews I was a little skeptical, but I wanted to try it, and since my husband was not interested in checking this place out,  I went with two of my favorite girlfriends.  I ordered the Pasta alla Vodka, and I did like it, A LOT.  The soft ricotta purses, were so yummy, specially if you ate it with a morsel of the crispy pancetta.  Our server was very nice, I think his name was Edward.  They were very attentive to our needs. The place is like a better Maggiano's IMHO.  The prices are very reasonable and we had a great time, we were there for two hours."}
{"text":"Omg. I have a new place to dine at.. Expect a wait very popular awesome food and service..Had very good drinks also.."}
{"text":"Bacca Limon Martini (as described on their menu)
Bacardi Razz, Il Tramonto Limoncello and fresh muddled raspberries served up and topped with Prosecco. 9.00

Bacca Limon Martini (as described by my taste buds) = unforgettable!

So, yeah, we went for happy hour....and wished we had left more room for a full meal by the menu descriptions of some dinner entrees! However, for happy hour, the portions were plentiful and super tasty. We shared an oversized Brio burger and the margharita flatbread - both yummy, although the flatbread was a bit burnt along the edges. I liked it that way; my girlfriend, not so much....so they happily replaced it with the caprese ravioli. Super yum!

This was a nice introduction to an upscale chain restaurant that I had been wanting to experience....next time, dinner & possibly cannoli :[]"}
{"text":"Had an awesome birthday dinner here for my husband thanks to our server Craig! 
We took advantage of our rewards card and started with the Garlic, Artichoke, Spinach Dip which was delicious (especially those little cheesy triangles of deliciousness they serve it with).
For entrees he went with the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccine which he couldn't stop raving about and I decided on the Fettuccine with Tomato Compote and Kalamata Olives (which I wasn't too sure about when I ordered, but was SO glad I did, because it was delicious and under 600 calories!) Our 3 year old had the kid's pepperoni pizza which was delicious and more than enough for him (and such a steal at that price point!)
We finished off with a free birthday dessert (thank you Brio for taking that extra step for us!), and the kiddo enjoyed his kid's ice cream sundae.

Our server was wonderful, he was friendly, attentive (but not hovering), and made our dinner extra special. We truly appreciate the wonderful customer service and delicious food to boot. Thanks Brio!"}
{"text":"Terrible food, ok service. Worst Bloody Mary I've had in my whole life. For the cost and quality I would've / should've gone across the street to echo and rig...

Got the Sicilian omelette and it was as if they took a pasta dish and added eggs, bad. Lobster bisque tasted like plain butter, gross."}
{"text":"I have lived in Vegas for about 5 and a half years now. My husband and I are foodies, so we have been all over Vegas for dinner, from super fine dinning, to buffets. Brio is our favorite place to eat hands down. The service is always great and the food is ALWAYS terrific. We have never ordered something we didn't like! We love the mushroom di bella pasta, Pasta alla vodka, and the bistecca inselata...the steaks are great as well. They also have the best ice tea in Vegas! Highly recommend Brio!!"}
{"text":"We got there at 6:30pm with no reservations, they were busy, so the hostess  gave us a buzzer, so when our table was ready we will get buzzed,in less than 5 min. we were buzzed.(THAT WAS SUPER FAST) The decore inside nice, nice, the place looked great,and the the smells coming out of the kitchen you thought you were back in Tuscany. It felt back home for a while.We sat in the gazibo room, the  lites were nice and dimm, and the atmosphere was great. Sandy was our waitress and she was very polite and spirited. Her recomendations were awsome, the ceaser salads that came out were fresh and the lettuce crisp the lobster bisqe was good too.The basket with the bread that came out was nice and hot. As soon as they  saw our table empty with bread they kept on coming with more, and they always refilled our drinks as well. The pasta dishes with ricotta panceta in a vodka cream sause excellent (Pasta a la Vodka),the brazed beef with cremini mushrooms and homade noodles was great, the flavors were all there, awsome!! The mohitos are a little on the lite side, but it was corected from Sandy.The deserts that came out in little espreso cups [2.50 each] Smart!! Very good idea you can try them all. In general the experience was great and we will be back. For a chain restaurant to look that good and please their customers so well, gets 5 stars from me. PPERRRFFECCTOOOOOOOOOO!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The pastas are second to none, the bread is number one and the service is OK. ones in a while the food is a little greasy but over all I am coming back for another dish. Like to experiment new specials."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Brio. Came with a few friends and Ashley was my server! She recommended the Strawberry Fresca and it is my new favorite drink! She was so knowledgeable about the menu. She recommended a few items for me and I decided on the Gorgonzola crusted beef medallions. It was DELICIOUS! Ashley was so warm and welcoming and really made my experience at Brio special. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"First time trying Brio was at Tivoli Village during happy hour. It was nice sitting outside until sunset cuz I felt like I roasted out in the sunlight. Aside from the tanning, the happy hour specials are f*ing great. There's a wide variety of $3 appetizers & discounted martinis to choose from & it turns out that my favorites were the margherita flatbread & lemontinis."}
{"text":"I never really paid attention until last night while out having dinner with my mom, but Brio is a fantastic blend of Carabas meets Cheesecake Factory.  What does that mean? Fixed menu, factory workers as servers, little intimacy in the entire venue, just get-em in get-em out experience. It's like a production line.. granted most restaurants are but they all don't FEEL that way.

Now, I'm not saying things were bad, my server (forgot his name) was very nice and super attentive, food was good (not great, just good), and over all it was a decent dining experience.

I would chalk this place up as saying it's just another commercial chain food establishment with main perks being their happy hour specials and outdoor seating when the weather is nice.

Sorry Brio, I'm just as disappointed as you are."}
{"text":"The shrimp & egg plant appetizer
Is excellent.  Smoking deals at happy hour - really good drink prices and food.  Oh yes - the regular food inside the restaurant is very good too.  (Note that I said very good and gave them four stars - they are very good, but not to die for and think you went to Tuscany."}
{"text":"We continue to have excellent service and delicious food so we will forever be loyal customers! I always recommend this place to couples, singles, and families. It's great for anyone! The kid's menus are great and the kid's pizzas are huge! My son loves it here!"}
{"text":"My two friends and I went to San Tan to get some food and ended up at Brio. The weather was perfect, the patio seating was available and the street musician was wooing us with his romantic accordion skills.

We started with a caprese appetizer to share. It fed just two people as it wasn't a big appetizer but the produce was fresh. I would have liked more of a balsamic glaze on it since the tomatoes and mozzarella weren't super juicy on their own (hence the greater need for oil and vinegar).

On to our entrees, I had the Bio salad and my friend had the Vodka ravioli with some added sausage. He had been craving sausage and peppers pasta all day and so this was the closest thing he could get to it at Brio. His ravioli was very tasty- the pasta itself was delicate and thin and the filling was plentiful and very cheesy. The vodka sauce tasted pretty standard- however, the sausage was cut very thin and cooked crispy almost like bacon. It tasted alright but not the thick and juicy piece of meat we expect when we order sausage - hahah who knew describing a piece of meat could sound so NSFW!

On to the less sexy plate, my Brio salad. The red peppers were warm and juicy and the asparagus had a nice grill on it. The rest of the salad was mostly lettuce so there was nothing to rave about there. Meh

If we weren't full enough, my two friends got desserts: the mascarpone caramel cake and the lava cake a la mode. The mascarpone cake was very delicate, creamy and fluffy and had hints of caramel but it wasn't overpowering at all. I thought the dessert was perfect. The lava cake was unfortunately not lava-y on the inside and just tasted like a chocolate cake with ice cream. Nothing you can't replicate at home or can purchase from a box.

Our service was pretty good except for a couple re-reminders of the beers we ordered. It gets 3 stars because I would expect tastier and more interesting food at that price. Nothing terrible, just nothing awesome either. Oh, the mediocre expectations of chain restaurants..."}
{"text":"Second time coming here and it's only been for happy hour! It's so great:) my sister and I decided to spend some quality time together. We sat at the bar because all the couches were taken. Delmar was amazing:) Excellent service. He was so nice and even made my sis and I a yummy shot because she recently turned 21. Cute! Kind! And good at what he did. No complaints here lol oh and the food is always good. Next time I go here I'd like to see the actual menu though. I'm sure it's delish. Dessert was also very good! Overall this place is great to go out on date or hang out with the girls."}
{"text":"Went to a Sunday lunch with my mom, but never again.  The service was awful and it wasn't even busy at all.  My mom ordered a chicken flatbread only to find two hairs (not hers) and a piece of plastic wrapper? No thank you..."}
{"text":"I remember we visited this restaurant more than a year ago and whatever we ordered was decent,  (my memory plays tricks on me). Well, we decided to go there on 4th of July, and it was a rude awakening for me. I don't know how one person can possibly eat their appetizer and a main dish. The prices are not cheap (for this kind of a restaurant), so Brio Tuscan Grill tries to please people by serving non-human portions. 

Our friend ordered one of their salads ($15!) - it was such a disturbing mess on that plate. I think they put every vegetable and fruit they had in the kitchen. Then I received my bruschetta - it was ok, but too much of everything on top plus I would prefer less balsamic vinegar. If you ever had bruschetta in rural Italy, I can tell you that this was not even remotely close to real Italian bruschetta. Of course, I got 5 big pieces for an appetizer. My spicy shrimp with eggplant was drenched in oil and eggplant was too bready. I ordered it instead of a main course, but couldn't finish it. My husband got himself lasagna. Ok, this was the final straw. Come on, you could feed at least 3 people (and I'm being modest). Lasagna was just ok, but I couldn't stand to look at the portion and the sauce, which came straight from a can. 

What is going on? Why are they oversizing everything? I felt as if I was an animal brought to a feeding before being slaughtered. Apparently, it is just me, because the restaurant was full, and it looks like a lot of people on Yelp really enjoyed it. I won't spend my money there anytime soon, but if you're willing to give it a try, share your main dish or expect to take it with you (considering you like it)

On the positive side, the decor is pretty and their booths are comfortable.  My husband really liked their artichoke and spinach dip. The service was nothing to rave about.

Btw, what kind of Italian menu  has lobster bisque on it? I thought lobster bisque was 100% French"}
{"text":"We used to eat here all the time, but at this specific location, my last three meals came back prepared with old food. We are talking about lettuce with pink edges and smelly chicken with a rubbery texture. Not willing to risk foodborne illness, we have not returned. Their other location at Town Square, however has never disappointed."}
{"text":"It was my first and last time at Brio. The service was disappointing and the waiter was not personable or attentive at all until he presented us with the bill. 
When I made the reservations, I notated it was my daughters 25th birthday. Obviously, no one read it so why bother putting down extra instructions?  No one said Happy birthday or offered a house dessert to celebrate the occasion. 
It took 15-20 minutes before we received water or bread on the table.
Drew, the waiter basically ignored us and spent a majority of his time telling the patrons in the booth next to us his life story. 
They ran out of fettuccine noodles and substituted spaghetti in the pasta dish we ordered at the same price. How does an Italian Resturant run out of pasta?
I choose to spend my money at the Mission in Scottsdale where the food is great and server Simone is superb!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation for dinner and they asked if we were celebrating a special occasion. I mentioned that it was my friend's bday and when we were seated at our table, a handwritten card with a voucher for a free appetizer was waiting for my friend. It was a simple thing but totally blew us away. Nice job Brio!"}
{"text":"I have not once had a bad experience in either locations an would recommend the lamb chops an chicken parm to die for!! Also for an appetizer you must try the spinach artichoke dip they have its honestly AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Brio on 10-28-16.  Very good service, low to moderate noise level in a relaxed and comfortable atmosphere.  I had a generous and super fresh chopped house salad and a bowl of some excellent mushroom soup at a total of just under $10.  Soup and salad came with a good quality crusty bread and several slices of a crispy, seeded flatbread along with a generous portion of salted butter.  The service is consistently good here but I would prefer if Brio were a stand-alone restaurant as parking is a bit of a challenge."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying brio and it was exceptional. The service and the food was amazing! Our server Jessica was very sweet and was able to recommend great dishes. We had a little bit of everything! The lobster bisque, spicy shrimp and eggplant, and lump crab cakes were delicious and the chocolate lava and cheese cake desserts were to die for! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Brio's Happy Hour is getting worse and worse.  I would have given Brio a strong 3 stars or a week 4 months ago.  

I still think their Sunday Brunch is solid and the dinner options are fine.  There are certainly better options out there for both.  Their wine list has always been stale and conventional.

The most disappointing thing is their changing quality and quantity of HH items.  HH was the best thing they had going for them.  The first month that their Happy Hour was going the portions were much larger and it seemed as if more care was taken...when their burger was first added it was great for the price.  The patty has changed and it is now a crappy burger covered up in a good I-N-O style burger spread."}
{"text":"Had a romantic impromptu date with my love. If u can manage it, sit at the bar. Most fun. Happy hour was awesome. Great prices for amazing food. Brio burger paid almost nothing was fantastically orgasmic... Med rare! Yum yum."}
{"text":"Great food but my favorite part about Brio is the tiramisu!!! I've come just to have dessert when visiting Las Vegas"}
{"text":"My review is not for issues with the food, but the cleanliness (or lack there of) of the restaurant on Friday night when I was there. There was hair on the tablecloth, lots of it! It wasn't on the top, it was on the part that hangs off he table. I brought it to the attention of the waitress and she said that was disgusting. I also pointed out that the hair was greasy and she cleaned that up, but never bothered to do anything about the hair on the table. The plates on the table (for the bread) had so much water that when my friend put her bread on one of them, it got soggy. The food was good, but my experience upon being seated made me wonder about the hygiene in the preparation and service of my meal."}
{"text":"Dear management im hear to inform you that your company needs to follow through. I love your food i order and have recomended my clients to go there for date nights to lunch. I watch want i eat like most people so kids meals are more my portion size . I recently order in the past week i was told that i couldnt recieve it at discounted price which was fine im not cheap i will pay but i dont want to waste food by buying full size. I was told that i will not be served by there manager do to the fact that i gave him more service by sending in more customers . well mr. Manager your rude unprofessional i as well as my team will not be returning. Also i work with well paying clients who are always looking for a new place to eat I will not recommend you guys anymore though your food may be great I will not put up with such despiteful rude people"}
{"text":"We visit this restaurant each time we are in town. The ambiance, friendly wait staff and mostly delicious food are the best in this part of Gilbert which seems to have more than its share of fast food restaurants. The portion sizes are more than generous and the value for your money is excellent. 

The bread and crackers they serve almost before you have a minute to catch your breath never fail to please the palette.

Where the restaurant did not earn top points concerns their menu which creates a few challenges for a plant based eater. Almost every menu item has cheese or some other dairy or meat included. They could really benefit from updating the menu to include some truly delicious pasta dishes and create some raw vegetable dishes that are not smothered in oil, cream or both. Even the minestrone which is heavily salted and thick with a heavy tomato paste aftertaste needs a fresh update. The minestrone soup tastes just like the sauce they put on the pomodorro pasta dish. This seems like such a no brainer for the chefs to come up with a few menu items that would be more appealing than ordering some overcooked roasted vegetables and fingerling potatoes without the parmesan cream. 

My husband chose the fish cakes which he loved."}
{"text":"I had never eaten at brio till last night. I was excited because I had always heard great things. I ordered a the chopped salad and lobster bisque. My boyfriend order the shrimp and lobster pasta which I was excited about. Our food came out in a timely manner, but as I was about to eat my salad there was a large hair which was very off putting. My waitress so kindly apologized and brought me another salad. As I was waiting I ate some of my boyfriends pasta but it had no flavor and there was only a couple pieces of seafood. Couple hours later I got home and began to feel ill with the symptoms of food poising. This experience was very off putting and unfortunately I will never be back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere - If the Pope decided to make a bootlegged version of the Cheesecake Factory and build it smack-dab in the middle of the Vatican you would have Brio Tuscan Grill. I know, I know, the Vatican is nowhere near Tuscany, but I think you get my point.  

Service - Have you ever disturbed an anthill and watched the whole colony explode with activity? That's how Brio felt tonight. There were servers, bussers and ancillary staff hastily moving about, keeping everything in order.  Like a finely tuned machine, every angle was covered, every crumb quickly swept aside.  Did that teenager just windex my menu? Henry Ford would be proud, for apparently the US restaurant industry has become a quintessential assembly line operation. If the formula if followed, so too will profits. 

Food - The food tastes great. Is that any surprise? Among other things, my entree contained the following ingredients... lobster, shrimp, fettucini, mushrooms, asparagus and heavy cream.  I am almost insulted they didn't throw bacon, truffles and a few sticks of butter in there. I love food and I was really hungry, so what I had for dinner at Brio would be the equivalent of giving an alcoholic a bottle of Louis XIII Cognac and asking if they like the taste of it.  Effin A yeah I liked it! What do you expect? There are some foods on this wondrous planet of ours that simply taste incredible regardless of the setting. I should have ordered the roast chicken so I would have a better idea of weather or not this place really knows how to cook. Oh, we also had the fried ravioli appetizer. Stuffed with ricotta resting on top of a very good marinara sauce. Don't even get me started.  

Summary - Either way, what I had was very good, but it's nothing that you can't get from about a dozen other Italian chains out there.  It's like the macaroni grill but with larger portions, nicer bathrooms and a 30% price hike.  Next time I am starving, craving a rich, creamy pasta dish and I happen to be in the neighborhood I'll probably come here again. 

And lastly, the red wine served at Brio is effective, as I am sure you can tell from the above review."}
{"text":"i probably had the best service at this restaurant than i have ever had anywhere. Elana the hostess was friendly from the start.

Megan was very helpful and I was able to buy lunch for my friends as a complete surprise. Props to the staff for being very helpful in a slightly odd situation. Thanks for helping spread some smiles."}
{"text":"This establishment is in the Tivoli Mall. The service was very good. The food was excellent. We ordered Campanella Carbonara and one of the Risotto specials. Both were very tasty. Also a Caesars salad and a nine oz glass of house wine. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Happy hour: love the lounge and patio atmosphere. $5 cocktails and $2.95 appetizers! The shrimptini and spicy shrimp & eggplant appetizers were awesome as were the peach bellinis. The shrimptini was refreshing though a bit heavy on the dressing, and the spicy shrimp & eggplant was gooooood, as in I-want-to-dive-into-a-pool-filled-with-this-stuff-and-eat-my-way-out kind of good! Get the ravioli caprese if you dig Costco frozen meals and hate caprese - i.e. there was virtually no caprese. The formaggio was also kind of bland, which says a lot since I am an asiago lover. I still love you, Brio, and I suppose I can't really complain too much since $30 (including tip) got me a round of drinks and four appetizers. Still my numero uno at Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"Happen to show up during happy hour and was pleasantly surprised with the great deals they were offering! Our server was nice and it was not crowded at 3pm on a weekday. The food was delish too!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, we waited for 15-20 minutes to get service. But, beyond that, the service was great. On person that stood out to us the most was Jaime. He wasn't our waiter but he offered us cheese and had a Huge smile on his face. We joked a bit and laughed and he really set the mood for our party. We spoke to the manager about him and he was very pleased to hear what we had to say."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to LOVE this restaurant.  The last time we went there for lunch will be the last. We  were seated in the back of the restaurant walking by a mostly empty space.

{"text":"I always like this place.... Thought I reviewed it before.... Good atmosphere and good food. Good service.... Has one of my favorites... Beef Carpaccio. This is definitely better than B&B at the Venetian !!!!"}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour in town! It's Martini Wednesday !! $5 martinis. And great food, lots of choices!"}
{"text":"Heads up...strictly a happy hour review!

You can't beat a $2.95 happy hour menu.

There's quite a few choices to pick from and if you pick something ugh- well hey, it was only $3.

The BRIO burger comes with Provolone and housemade chips and seems to always be overcooked. It could use a little but more flavor, but I usually can only manage to eat half of one , which actually works out perfect because my gf can eat the other half. I am a man, and I do have the capacity of eating a full burger, but I dont find this burger delicious enough to want to eat the whole thing. The house chips are really good though.

Beef Carpaccio - I didn't know what this was when I ordere it. It said beef so I ordered it and when it came out it I didn't want it. I still ate it because i didn't want to be a d-bag and send it back, but basically what i learned is that this is raw beef. This entree came with field greens, capers, and mustard aioli. I know, i know, i should have probably wiki'ed what carpaccio was before I ordered it - but hey, it was only $3 and now I know I don't like it.

Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant: BOOM, winner. This is shrimp with Romano crusted eggplant and a black pepper cream sauce. Great taste, decent sized portion - order one if not two.

Shrimptini: Another winner winner, chicken dinner. Basically, chilled shrimp served in a martini glass with roasted tomato cocktail sauce and fresh lemon. So gooood.

Spinach & Artichoke Dip: Comes with this crispy parmesan flatbread that is more filler than anything. I didn't much care for it. 

As for seating, it's only bar seating and out of the 3 times I have been here - it's a challenge to find seating. It's like that feeling you get when you're in the mall parking lot during christmas time looking for a spot to park your car....you have to be vigilante otherwise some other 40 something milf will cut you off and take your bar stool without looking back. 

If you're in the mood for a modestly priced happy hour and dont mind a wait - brio is the place to be."}
{"text":"Great Italian food! Atmosphere is so relaxed and comfortable. Come for a lunch break between shopping at Town Square or enjoy a nice dinner out on the patio with wine.  We ordered the roasted red pepper bruschetta, the lobster and shrimp Pasta, and for my 5 year old the kids macaroni with a side salad.  Good portions too. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Really good italian food for a decent price! There is usually a long wait.. We had to wait for an hour, but the ambiance and quality of food was worth it! I ordered the pasta alli vodka. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting Brio at Town Square since a long time ago. Approximately since 2007 or so. This is the place to celebrate family birthdays, bring people when visiting from out of town. I have had very good experience with staff until tonight. My son's 14 bday dinner. The waiter was the most clueless waiter I have seen comparing to restaurants in the level of Brio. From the beginning, he forgot to bring my soup, i didnt bring it up thinking it was an honest mistake. Then, i was without a drink for 21 minutes and when I asked him, he never brought it. My daughter had to go to the bar area to ask and another gentleman who brought my drink while our waiter was high fiving and hugging every girl including the hostesses that would cross his path. When our dinner came out, we usually get a \"Did your dinner come out ok?\" from a regular waiter. This guy said \" Are you all happy now?\" After the drink incident which im sure someone told him about it, he didnt even recognized and owned up to his mistake but ignored it completely. To top it off, he comes towards the end to ask if we wanted dessert(Of course we said no) and made a comment if our party of 4 switched places on the table....I just had to make a comment to see if he gets it and I said; \"Maybe you should come around more often\"...that comment flew in front of his forehead and he didnt even have a reaction to it.....I have never seen this guy before but next time I go and if i decide to go back to this location, I will make sure I dont get this waiter and run away from his area. Tivoli Village location is almost the same distance for me. I guess i will make that decision later. I consider myself a good tipper(20% to 25%) for average service. At the same time, I give less and even $0 if the experience is a disaster like tonight. I am not looking or any freebies or anything like that but i someone needs more info on who this individual is, please feel free to message me or comment here."}

\"Very disappointed that my review from yesterday shows that I wrote it last September. You're a class act Brio's, own up to a bad review once in awhile. 
I love Brio's in Town Square. My husband and I take out of town friends whenever someone visits. It's always part of the Las Vegas experience we love to share. We took a very dear friend tonight who is visiting From New Jersey. She's waited for years to go. As always, the food was great. However, our server was lousy. First time ever! We had to ask someone else to bring parmesan, a little extra sauce for my crab cakes, my husband sat for 15 minutes with an empty wine glass...we were told she had 'other customers'. It was 4 pm..not busy. She just wasn't good. First time I ever saw my husband leave a 10% tip. Such a disappointment from a place we love so much.\":"}

{"text":"The food has been good every time I go, and the atmosphere is great.

But, there was one time in particular where the service was disappointing. There were only 3 of us, and the restaurant was mostly empty, but we waited at least 15 minutes before our server even came get our drink orders. He was a middle-aged balding man, and he had a HORRIBLE attitude the whole time! He brought us waters, and after he left, I made a comment about how mine didn't have a lemon but the others did (this wasn't an angry comment, I was just pointing it out as a coincidence because I don't like lemon in my water). He came back a few minutes later with a full plate of lemons, set them on the table, said nothing, and walked away. I was stunned. Our food took forever, and he was so rude. If I got him as a server again, I would switch to a different table; he was that bad. For a nicer restaurant, that behavior from waiters is totally unacceptable! I wouldn't be surprised if he treated other customers this badly.

I love the food and the decor is great, but I think some of the waiters probably need a few lessons in customer service!"}

Waitstaff are wonderful and attentive. 4 out of 5 stars for the hostesses. Ive gone in quite a few times and its always teenage girls standing there talking to each other, offer me no smile or greeting upon entering or leaving. Had a nice talk with the manager that was more than open to hearing me out and agreeing there is a problem. I will be back for the delish food for sure =)"}

The HALF BURRATA & PROSCIUTTO SANDWICH that tasted as if tapioca had a kid. The complete lack of flavor made it a sad meal. To make the box more appealing baked crisps were put in. A solid challenge for even to eat even one. They have made items that can be used in construction. NEVER AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Brio Tuscan continues to offer the best tasting, best value Happy Hour in and around the Kierland/Quad area of Scottsdale. The other Happy Hour restaurant we would recommend would be Tommy Bahama's.

Happy Hour at Brio run from 3 to 6, Monday thru Friday. 

They have for $4.00 Bruschetta and Margherita Flatbread (photo); for $5.00 they have a fabulous tasting Beef Carpaccio with capers and aioli mustard (photo), Tomato Mozzarella Salad, Potato Skins (photo), Buffalo Chicken Nachos and a whole lot more. See menu photo. 

Brio continues to offering $5.00 Martini's on Wednesdays and Wine on Thursdays.  Their only shortcoming continues to be their minuscule bar area with limited seating.  What they really need is to consider is an expansion, because the outdoor seating just doesn't work well in the winter, when our snow bird friends arrive. 

Our most recent tab came to $23.75 including taxes, but before gratuities.  Good food, good drinks, good value!

I had the Lasagna which was served with a mixture of alfredo and red sauce.  It was seriously one of the best lasagna dishes I have had in a long time.  Loved the bread plate before the meal.  One thing that stood out on the service: I dropped a knife while eating, and by the time I was able to pick it up, a waiter was already at the table with a new knife and took the one I dropped.  It's the little things that make tipping feel like it was worth it!  The only thing keeping it from getting a higher rating is it did feel like a corporate restaurant.  In this case, that's probably not a bad thing because I would imagine the food and service remains very consistent.  Brio is definitely above average in both categories."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Brio and it won't be the last. The bar was pretty packed for a spy on vegas open bar from 6-9. We managed to snag the last 3 seats at the bar at 5:45 which was lucky considering it was standing room only by 6:30. The service was definitely above average, quick and courteous even when they were swamped with all the event goers. I can't comment on the drink prices during happy hour because we were taking advantage of the free peach sangria and cucumber gin gimlets but the $2.95 tasting menu in the bar area is fabulous.  
The Ravioli Caprese arrived with 3 generously sized pieces of ravioli in marinara sauce. Not only was this dish tasty, but for $3 I was impressed by the portion size. The Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant was my favorite of the dishes we ordered. The portion is smaller than the ravioli but the flavor makes up for the size. So good, and only $3. We'll order two of those next time. The Margherita Flatbread was a little bland for my taste but between the other dishes and the bartenders plying us with free booze it's hard to complain."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our Easter brunch at Brio, they took reservations which is great when you have hungry kids.  The kids meals were huge, my son had a big bowl of rigatoni with a full chicken breast which was very tender.  My husband and I ate Pasta Brio and it was delicious, my sister had a great GF meal too and enjoyed her pasta.  We also shared a really good tiramisu!  I have not eaten here in awhile but I think we will make an effort to come more!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Best risotto I've ever had ordered risotto with shrimp, did not disappoint. Amazing wonderful beautiful delicious. Also ordered lobster bisque, Lasagna, A few other things. Everything was excellent, delicious. I make my own lobster bisque from scratch and have for many years, this was as good as mine. Rich and creamy, lobster flavor perfect, fresh. Little pieces of lump lobster in it wonderful."}
{"text":"I will definitely give the an E for effort! Our server somewhat tried. I understand he was busy with three tables but he seemed to ignore me when I was asking about my drink. When he finally came I watched fix my drink as it is instead of making a new one. Now I have a watery him when I told him that it needs to be double strained!! Ugh!!! Our food was ok! I just expect edit to be bigger considering what I have seen in pictures on YELP!! Not very happy with this place! I'm only going to Town Square Brio!! They have better service there! I rarely give one star but this place really deserve it! If the have a no star I'd give that!! No wonder it slow here!! At least he knew the menu well!! Thanks for nothing Alberto! I think that his name!"}
{"text":"I have been to Brio before and normally sit in bar area. on this  visit I was meeting my girlfriend and her family from out of town. Monday afternoon not to busy got sat right away. now to be fair I did ask for another table so I was given a different server. took a few minutes for him to come by and he did greet table nicely. there was 3 adults and 2 kids we ordered some ice teas and that took at least 5 minutes. 
our server Josh came by and took our order then brought out bread. food was brought out without Caesar salad, which we had to ask for. one of the children ordered the kids mac and  cheese did not like the food. so I had to flag down another server to find my server to get her something  else to eat. finally our server came by and never mentioned  the new order. I let him know about the new order and he went ànd brought it over. 
overall food was okay but service  was not. server was only at table 4 times including he never checked back to see if we were okay. a man could of been manager only stopped by once to see if second order was okay. I am sure based on business maybe server had off day as the alternative  would be he was not good at his job."}
{"text":"$2.95 tuscan taster menu is where it's at. A great happy hour. My personal fave the spicy shrimp and eggplant. I think I need another order. Loved the brio burger and pepperoni flatbread too :) yummy."}
{"text":"We ate here recently and had a wonderful experience. I got the crab cakes which were delicious. At first my order had gotten mixed up with the crab cake crusted salmon but it was quickly fixed and they gave me a lobster bisque order to tide me over. The lobster bisque is addicting, so delicious. The crab cakes were amazing and I had no problem eating every bite. Can't wait till we go back again."}
{"text":"Brio is amazing hands down but the service is what really puts any restaurant over the top. I've never received such amazing genuine service from everyone that works at a restaurant. I sat at the bar this time and Terri was the bartender. If you ever have the chance to interact with her consider yourself lucky. She is so full of energy, fun, and attentive. She became very busy the day I was there but she always checked on me to make sure I had everything I needed or wanted. She's funny and all around a good genuine person. Every server that passed by me always asked how I was doing and how my food was. Jessie one of the managers is the cherry on top of amazing service. He is always cool calm and collected and I see him running around with the servers helping them out. He's a genuine guy who cares about the way his restaurant is ran. If you're looking for good food and GREAT service this is the place to be!!!"}
{"text":"Brio has not maintained the quality standard that it had when it first opened. Crumbs were all over the booth, food was very slow coming, it took too long to pay, and most importantly, the food just wasn't as good as it had been on numerous previous visits.

They are in a prime spot at Town Square and I'm afraid they might be resting on location to keep patrons coming in the doors, rather than improving the food quality."}
{"text":"Our last night in the Phoenix area and this was our last stop! I had already eaten a trillion times that day and the whole week--needless to say I wasn't as hungry as I normally am. On  tjhis certain Friday night after 7pm, the restaurant was very busy and there was a wait. What I did like about this restaurant is they take your phone number and they will notify you via text when you table is ready. We had a 40 minute wait so this gave us plenty of time to shop! The hostess was very nice! After about 35 minutes of waiting/shopping at the mall, a text was sent to let me know my table would be ready soon and to start heading back. My husband grabbed the table before I made it back but the hostess kindly directed me to our table. Once seated it took our waiter a moment to get there---hey were busy so I understand. He finally came and took our drink orders while we looked over the menu. I tried their pink lemonade (not sure what the lemonade was mixed with) which was delicious! One thing that I did not like was our waiter waited until we waited for a while, placed our drink order, had a our drinks refilled, and placed our food order before he brought bread to our table. For the most part he was very nice. Our food arrived and I ordered a Brio Chopped salad and added a side of grilled chicken to go with it (only three dollars or so to add chicken to a salad). My salad, the chicken, and the restaurant dressing was very good! My daughter got the kids pizza which was the size of an adult pizza that could feed two people--at least! Her pizza also had fresh ingredients and tasted good. My husband ordered a Strawberry Balsamic Chicken Salad--which was soooooo good! My mother in law ordered a Caesar salad and barely received any salad in her bowl. The waiter was nice enough to take the salad back and have them add more salad to her bowl. The original salad she received ordered was very skimpy on the portion--I am not even sure if it was a joke or not. Although we didn't order any of their major menu items, the items we did ordered were really good. I am not a major Italian restaurant eater, but when I return to the Phoenix area and have a larger appetite for Italian, I will be sure to give them another try."}
{"text":"We had our wedding reception in the large private room and I am so glad we chose Brio for our event. The food was amazing, our guests could not stop talking about how good everything was. And the service was great, the waitresses were on top of it the entire night. They really exceeded my expectations, our reception could not have gone any better!"}
{"text":"First time in a Brio Restaurant. Great ambience and cozy dining hall decorated luxuriously. I am not fond of Italian pasta but the Campanelle Carbonara and the Lobster Bisque was so good and perfectly satisfied my picky taste bud. The appetizer Calamare was the best I've ever tried so far. The Triple Dessert plate was excellent. My family now loved this place. Our waitress Alisha we specially attentive to our needs and has successfully made us all feel at home. She has served us excellently!
Will definitely go back to this place!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years and it only gets better.  I really like the prices as they are reasonable compared to other restaurants that are not nearly as good."}
{"text":"The staff: Somebody's always smiling, so that's a good sign.  They're cordial and they know their menu.  Most of the servers I've had there have been very friendly, got the time to know us and chat it up a bit.  Sometimes we come when it's busy and we don't see our server much; which is fine, I don't like when people hover anyway, but it would help if we didn't have to wait for them to walk by so we could ask for something.

The goods: Incredible happy hour.  The Brio Burger is probably my favorite thing to get but I've tried just about everything on the HH menu and I can't remember disliking anything.  The basic menu can get a little pricy.  I ordered a salmon salad something or other once, $14.95.  I won't say it wasn't worth the money because, oh my God it WAS.  But, I'm just saying, pricy (at least for me).  I love their dessert display.  We do something similar at the fine dining restaurant I used to work at.  They bring the plate over so you can look at your desserts.  Very good eye-catcher.  I always order the chocolate cake thingy (I should really learn the names...but whenever I order I sort of just point and say, \"I want THAT.  Please and thank you.\")  Their raspberry mascarpone cheesecake is heaven.  It melts in your mouth and the crust is the only thing left to chew.

The atmosphere: I think in all the times I've come here I've only sat inside once.  I love sitting outside watching the shoppers of Tivoli Village.  It always kind of freaks me out though when one of the valet boys starts running for a car.  I have to turn around and see the red uniform before I realize it's not some guy stealing a lady's purse.  Other than that, everything else is great.  The lighting adds a lot to the ambiance, from the restaurant, and other shops alike.  And my friends and I are always listening intently to the music, trying to guess the language and what they're saying.  I think coming to Brio is going to end up being a weekly thing for us.  We're all kind of night owls these days and we've got to start somewhere, best to do it where we can fill our stomachs and prep for the night ahead."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this restaurant and I was very impressed. I went with two friends on a weekday in the evening and there was no wait. The inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated and very clean. The service was also very friendly and attentive. 

The food was great. We ordered a bruschetta sampler appetizer which had a few different types of bruschetta on it. I wasn't the biggest fan of them, but that was a personal taste thing, my two friends loved it (sometimes traditional things just can't be out done). I had a glass of sangria which was decent, but tasted syrupy too me. These reasons are why I took off a star. 

My entree was delicious. The sauce was very light which is my preference (heavy creamy sauces make me feel like a blimp after my meal, some people are into that, but not me). I'd come back and order it again definitely. 

Also, they have a promotion right now if you sign up for their points club thing you get a discount on your meal that night (I think it was 20%), which was a nice surprise. Pretty much 100x better than olive garden, and for about the same price."}
{"text":"My dish was delicious and very well prepared. My partners on the other hand was a bit on the small size for an entree. The size portion for the pastas should be a little bit larger for the price. The atmosphere was ok a little busy, but this location is prime."}
{"text":"calamari was the worst I have had ever in my life. Definitely did not look like the pictures. It was just a bunch of bread crumbs and prepubescent squid bodies  Pasta was ok but had to wait 30 mins even though I had a reservation. For shame.............."}
{"text":"Been here before, so this is my second time eating here. The place is nicely decorated roomy and airy, had the shrimp and eggplant and shrimp appetizer, it tasted phenomenal with an incredible brown sauce, a  piece of fried eggplant quartered under a all shrimp, this sauce will make you want to eat a door mat, but the quality of the shrimp, although tasty geared more towards a franchise restaurant not a fine dining establishment. I ordered the fettuccine with shrimp and lobster for my main course. Although again tasty (same small shrimp) and lobster, really? Asked my waitress if they forgot to add lobster to my dish, because I didnot see one piece or taste any half way through my meal. She apologized and proceed to bring me a plate of chopped up lobster chunks which I thanked her for and add to my meal, I finished my meal although good still no taste of lobster, I asked waitress if lobster was frozen and she admitted yes, which I had figured but even with additional lobster I couldn't taste it. The fettuccini tasted home made it was light but they could have made it without the bullshit baby shrimp or the frozen lobster what do you want for $20 bucks. When ordered the meal I had asked my waitress who was attentive and did a great job if there really was lobster and shrimp in the dish, and she said she I should have known you get what you pay for 6 baby shrimp fettuccine and 2oz of frozen lobster"}
{"text":"I took my mother out for lunch on Mother's Day . The place was packed and I didn't know we had to have reservations.  But was told that the bar area was open. There were tables there and had an amazing lunch our server Reno Martinez made our visit perfect . He was very knowledgeable of the menu and helped us with suggestions. We where attended quickly and he made us feel very welcomed. I highly recommend anyone to sit at his section . Thank you Brio for hiring such great and profesional help... Thank you Reno Martinez you made my Mother feel special with such wonderful service ..."}
{"text":"We were celebrating and decided to try someplace we've never been to before. The decor was lovely and ambiance romantic without feeling stuffy. Service was very good. 

We shared a Caesar salad to start. It's was fresh, crisp and tasty. My husband had a filet mignon that was very tender and flavorful. I had lemon chicken. It was good but not excellent. The sauce wasn't lemony enough and a little shy on capers for my preference.  The accompaniments on our dishes were the same. I thought the vegetable were excellent, mashed potatoes were good. I had enough leftovers for us to share for lunch the next day. My husband had the creme brûlée dessert. Good flavor but served room temperature rather than chilled.  We will gladly come back for the steak. Next time I'll try their \"light\" chicken piccata to see if that is more to my liking."}
{"text":"Yesterday evening, a group of 10 of us decided to celebrate our friend's birthday by having dinner at Brio. I had been looking forward to trying Brio for a long time as I'm frequently in Town Square. 
When we first entered, I really liked the decor! It was very majestic and beautiful - kind of reminded me of Caesar's Palace!
We immediately ordered drinks. My best friend decided to order a Bloody Mary while I went with my favorite extra dirty martini. Both cocktails were disappointing. 
Our server then brought out several baskets of warm bread which was delicious and probably one of my favorite parts of the meal!
Our group ordered several appetizers to share - the calamari and the spicy shrimp & eggplant. Both dishes were excellent. 
Since my cocktail was unenjoyable, I decided to play it safe and order a glass of wine to complement my meal. I knew that I was going to go with seafood so I went with the Sauvignon Blanc from Italy which was an excellent choice! It was a very crisp and refreshing wine.
For the main course, I went with the Pesce Piccata (wild caught cod), which unfortunately lacked flavor, was rather dry, & overall disappointing. The angel hair pasta that came with it also tasted somewhat undercooked. My best friend ordered the evening's special - sea bass - which was delicious!
Finally, we ordered a few desserts that we all shared at the table. I had the crème brûlée and it was fantastic!
Overall, my favorite parts of the meal were the bread, appetizers, desserts, and overall ambiance. The service was very good too and our server was polite and knowledgeable. 
I plan on returning to try other items and specifically to try their happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went here for Easter brunch with my wife and a good friend. We sat outside on the patio and had a wonderful meal. The service was extremely courteous and friendly. Our food was served pretty quickly, and most importantly, it was delicious. We split an appetizer of bacon and tomato jam bruschetta with ricotta cheese and I would do it again in a heartbeat. I wish I could have taken a jar of that jam home with me. It was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. For my main course I had Gorgonzola-crusted lamb chops. They were cooked medium well, I asked for medium, but they were still great. The Gorgonzola crust was delicious and the mashed potatoes on the side were also quite good. It's a little pricey for brunch, but if you're not on a budget this is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and found my experience to be delightful. The restaurant is beautifully decorated big area and bright. We were greeted appropriately and taken to our seats right away. Our waitress came within a minute to offer us drinks. She was very nice and knew the menu. As always I like to ask questions just to see how much they know. I got the crab encrusted salmon which was light and delicious. The portions are good. The only thing I did not like, was that we were sitting right next to where the waiters pick up the food.  Everyone  
  all the waiters and waitresses were standing there whether they had to work to do or not. Some were working hard others were standing around talking and sitting so close to that area they were not talking work. Would  I go back? Of course the food was really good and the atmosphere was  calming and relaxing."}
{"text":"brio!

friendly staff. great service. spacious. huge portions. ordered the pesto pasta - light, fulfilling, and flavorful. great quality!

will come back again and try other things on the menu! check out the picture i posted."}
{"text":"This is a very nice Italian restaurant in San Tan.  Food was tasty and they have a nice beer and wine selection.  A great place to meet up with friends for a night out!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. Still has the best lava cake I can find anywhere. The chicken limone is always delicious, as well as the Caesar salad. Pasta alla vodka was to die for! Also, get the bruschetta sampler if you've never had their's before. Guaranteed you will find a permenant favorite for the future."}
{"text":"It's like the Olive Garden made good (autocorrect changed it to \"food\" originally, and that's not a bad fix)."}
{"text":"Cant get enough of their happy hour menu! 

Their blackened shrimp with eggplant was to die for as well as their Beef Carpaccio and their Crispy Tuscan Tots. It was so delicious that we ordered two of everything! The Roasted Garlic, Spinach and Artichoke Dip was ordinary but I do like the Pita like chips they come with.

Im not a fan of alcohol but those Sangria Rosa's are yum! Beware though, two of those and you'll be at a good level.

Trying to make it a weekly HH date with girl friends."}
{"text":"This place used to be great - maybe they are just having one of those days today - but they can't even seem to give you a correct wait time for delivery pick up.  Was told 15-20 min, which seems pretty standard at 8pm -- showed up 30 min after order and was told it would be another 10 min.... this was after waiting 5 for someone to show up at the host/hostess desk...
I was hoping that the food would taste as good as memory served me and at least be worth the annoyance- unfortunately, quality must have been on the chopping block here... $55 dinner for two ... such a waste - I chose this over the Olive Garden for flavor and over Maggianos due to the fact they get my order right only half the time.  BUYERS REMORSE all the way.  Food was bland and flavorless - tasted like reheated Olive Garden and for 2x the price! Plus the wait I would have had at Maggianos along with the aggravation of being quoted the wrong pick up time and offered empty apologies.
Unless you're good with overpaying for a low quality meal, I would recommend elsewhere- there is an Italian place down the street that at least still takes pride in quality food and customer service.
Will not be back ever again; a shame - I have had birthdays here, brunches here, date nights here and it was always fairly decent.  It has been about a year since my wife and I had the taste to swing into a Brio - but will not make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Food fairly basic. Run of the mill Italian.  Came out quick. Our server Cody was very friendly guy."}
{"text":"Las Vegas is not a walking city.  The hotels are far apart.  The suburbs have strip malls.  The heat in summer (and the cold in winter) makes much of the year unpleasant outdoors.  But in the spring and fall we can have some absolutely gorgeous days.  Last night was a beautiful warm spring evening.  It was not windy and the clouds overhead were spectacular.  This was the perfect time for dining al fresco and what better meal to have than something Italian.  A friend of ours who works at UNLV suggested this new restaurant in Town Square.  Although we have been to Town Square several times (and visit Fry's next door regularly), we had not tried this restaurant.

We were seated on the outdoor patio promptly and ordered the carpaccio which was recommended by our friend.  I'm glad we did as it was delicious.  I decided on the lobster risotto and my husband had the Veal Milanese both accompanied by a lovely Italian white wine.  There was plenty of lobster and asparagus in my risotto.  My husband's veal was tender with just enough capers and lemon butter to flavor it, but not to make it soggy.  I am not much of a dessert person, so we skipped it.  Sipping the last of our wine while the the sky grew dark was the perfect end to a beautiful day.  We will be back."}
{"text":"First time dining here.  The service was good except our waiter forgot to bring extra bread then after asking a third time, it showed up and my husband's second drink never showed.  HOWEVER, the ambiance was great and the food was better.  Will dine here again."}
{"text":"The food is usually good here, but I had a very bad experience with a staff person during our last visit and I will never be back because of this. 

We came here to eat dinner outside. I have asthma and environmental illness, and I try to avoid indoor spaces unless I am familiar with them. We asked to sit outside. I waited outside with my kids, by the outside door, while my husband went in to get a table. There were 2 5-top tables open right next to each other. 

My husband was the only one in there. Told her we wanted to sit outside. 4+ a baby. She said \"ok, I'll seat you right away.\" Disappeared, and when she came back there were two men who came in after my husband. She approached them and sat them BEFORE US! Meanwhile I'm Waiting outside with my kids and the patio is busy and I can't go inside! So the kids and I went and stood next to the other available table since we knew she was going to seat us there anyway. 

ELISA the hostess came out and screamed at us and said we needed to come inside. I've never been so embarrassed. 

1. If she seated us right away and in the order of which guests arrived, we would be sitting already, and not in the way. But, she sat the people who came *after* us first; two middle aged men who do not have a disability and did not have to hold a 25 pound toddler (welcome to Trump's America where men are more important...). 
2. She was going to be seating us at that open table anyway- SO WHY DID WE NEED TO COME INSIDE?! She tried to say we were in the way of wait staff but we were standing together, right next to the open table that we were GOING TO BE SITTING AT ANYWAY. My husband started explaining to her why I can't go inside- she wasn't having it at all. Kept insisting we had to come inside. It was insanity! So we left out of frustration and aggravation. 

I called Brio and spoke to the manager, Vina, right after the occurrence. She was understanding and compassionate. Hence the 2 stars. But these staffers need to be trained properly. The way she treated us was outrageous. I was screamed at by a 19 year old in front of a crowd of guests at this restaurant because she was incompetent. Never again."}
{"text":"Decided on Brio for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised that they had a new menu. For happy hour you need to sit in the bar area, either inside or out and there are a few high top tables that are included. We arrived at 5:40 and had about an hour left of happy hour which runs until 6:30. The movie started at 7:30 so we had time to chill.

For drinks waters, a white peach sangria 5/5 and a cucumber basil gimlet 3/5. For apps we ordered the beef carpaccio 5/5, shishito pepper hash 5/5 very nice flavoring with the sriracha aioli and the potato skins topped with cheddar cheese sauce, applewood bacon, green onions and lime crema 4/5. Service was wonderful and very attentive. They came by to let us know it was happy hour last call so we got another round of sangrias and another beef carpaccio. 

Thank you Brio for providing such a nice start to our evening at Town Square."}
{"text":"Well the best thing is that they offer a happy hour at 9pm (last hour before closing) not just drinks but bar foods too. Very nice. Area is nice a little but quite for a Tuesday night. Lol.  Drinks could be a little stronger but for the price decent."}
{"text":"I came here with my dad.  I got a side salad to start which was delicious.  And I got the Chicken Limone as my entree.  It was so delicious!  My dad got the Fish Limone Pasta dish.  It was ok.  I think it would have been better if the fish was grilled or baked.  It was fried fish which made the already heavy dish even more heavier.  The only thing I didn't care for was my drink.  I got the tropical cosmo that was on happy hour.  The happy hour prices are unbelievable.  This was my first time here and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Normally i don't bother with town squaresince it's not my scene   but friend wanted to come for happy hour.  Service was great,  our waitress was friendly and attentive. The happy hour food and drinks were good,  the artichoke dip was delicious. The pineapple drink had a good balance of flavor and alcohol, forgot its offical name.  It was a nice atmosphere even when it got crowded."}
{"text":"The appetizer wasn't as good as expected the calamari wasn't cooked enough. The entree was really good and the drink they could use a little bit of more alcohol in it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant !! Went with a large group and service was outstanding would also like to mention that the food was fabulous. Pricing is also very reasonable for the standard of the restaurant. Wish I could remember our server's name she was very great at anticipating the needs of our table."}
{"text":"Yummy brunch this morning at brio. Ordered the Bennie and hubby got the French toast. Amazing!!  Only problem was, we asked for the heater to be turned on about 4 times and then Bloody Mary had to be remade. Otherwise a great time"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here Tuesday night for dinner with a plan to come a bit early, sit at the bar, and enjoy some happy hour cocktails.  Our plan was thwarted when we realized this place was some sort of cougar gathering place.  The bar was packed with little hope of somebody getting up.  So, we just took a seat in the main dining area without a wait.

Anyway, everything to say about this place has already been said on here.  I expected much more because of the location but it really was just an upscale Olive Garden that charges triple.

The Gorgonzola Lamb Chops appetizer was great and so was the Bistecca Insalata.  I should have just stopped there and let that be my dinner.  Instead, for an entree, I ordered the Garganelli Carbonara which was waaaay too creamy, oversauced and under-flavorful.  It was not advertised like that on the menu.  Almost everything else on the menu sounds good but I doubt the stuff tastes as good as it looks.  My wife had some sort of shrimp dish that looked excellent but was way to salty and no doubt contained frozen shrimp.

The service was very good but I probably won't be back.  I almost never have pasta so when I do splurge I want it to be delicious and the stuff here is just blah."}
{"text":"Given that 99% of Italian restaurants in this country serve Italo-American food and not authentic italian food (take it from me, I lived in Bologna, Italy's food capital), I will say that Brio's lasagna is the closest to authentic I've ever seen at a casual italian place in the US.  They use not only red meat sauce, but also a creamy bechamel, which is how it's done in northern Italy.  Now, as for the gi-gundo lasagna portion size, that is authentically american!"}
{"text":"Walking in, the restaurant has a Tuscan feel.  It had a sophisticated appeal.  There wasn't anything in the decor that set it apart from other Italian restaurants.

The main thing I got out of my lasagna dish was \"cheesy.\"  2 types of cheeses and the alfredo sauce made it pretty heavy.  What I did like about it was that it came in very hot.  It isn't what I would expect from a lasagna and I've had better home-cooked lasagna.

I love the dessert selections.  So many to choose from and all in little bites.  After a heavy main course, having small treats ends the meal perfectly.  I had the creme brulee shot.  The dessert was very rich and creamy, what I would expect from a full sized creme brulee dish.  I wouldn't say it was the best creme brulee I ever had, but the small bite satisfied my sweet tooth without feeling guilty of eating too much.

My suggestion, don't get the lasagna.  Try something different.  But enjoy the small bites of desserts."}
{"text":"went with a co-worker, nice warm evening so we sat on the patio. It was a nice atmosphere, but right next to the airport, so you'll be chatting enjoying the outside lights & warm breeze, then a  plane is directly overhead & you think a wheel might fall onto your table...
food was good, liked the non-booze drink options, free refills, service was very good. 
I would go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. I have always visited the location in Gilbert, but this Scottsdale location is definitely awesome. The surrounding area has tons of shopping and it's a gorgeous area. My personal fav food here is the lobster bisque; I never come here without getting it! The bellinis are also delicious! You won't ever get a Bellini anywhere else. Seriously, I've never had a complaint anytime I've come here."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and it was good! The sour dough bread they give you prior to your meal is phenomenal!  I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara and it was delish! Enough to share, especially if you order it for lunch. The Campanelle Carbonara had chicken, crispy bacon and spinach in it, YUMMY!

The only thing I would change on my end was the friend who I had lunch with, that's about all. :)"}
{"text":"NOTE: This is  not a 'walk to' restaurant if you are cruising Kierland....hopefully someone will think of building a pedestrian bridge from Kierland.
A Tuscan feel upon entering - to me if smelled of crusty bread too!!

I think the restaurant had only been opened a few days - so everything was quite new - including the service staff. No worries there.

We stopped in for a quick lunch - they had a great selection of salads - good portion sizes!.
Will be back."}
{"text":"I will only come here for lunch from now on dinners are to overpriced for food that is not top notch!!"}
{"text":"Alexis was out server and she was the best I've ever had. I'm completely impressed with our experience. You have to go here!!"}
{"text":"We booked Brio for a small wedding reception from across the country, sight unseen, and were pleasantly surprised with the venue. Not only was everything arranged just as I had requested for our dinner, but the food was amazing (steaks were cooked perfectly) and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"A good restaurant indeed! I enjoyed the food of course ..the location is at best. The waiter and waitresses were so nice. The ambiance is somewhat beautiful...I loved the one we ordered,that was a bomb...
I want to go back there again if given any chance and order the same dish haha!!
The only thing so so was the Caesar salad I ordered, plainly twas only lettuce and crotons plus they don't have blue cheese, failed..
Otherwise, overall I'll give 8:))"}
{"text":"Me, my daughter and three friends had dinner here this evening.  We were celebrating a birthday.  The meal was delicious, the service was excellent and they even let us bring in our own cake.  Our waiter graciously brought it out, candles lit, and served it for us at the table.  I would highly recommend this establishment for your special celebration or an evening out."}
{"text":"I always have a good meal when I'm here. Service is great, pretty big place so don't have to wait a while and they have an amazing HAPPY HOUR! Its too bad its mon-thurs because i'm always free on fridays.. but most of their food during happy hour is So incredibly cheap i end up getting all!!
My faves:
Harvest Salad
Tomato Bisque Soup
Vodka Pasta
Shrimp and Eggplant thingy.. (forget the name, its an appetizer)
Must try the above listed.. its amazing~! So good that i didn't know it was a chain restaurant. Good job BRIO!
**Not the best place for Vegan, but can be vegetarian friendly."}
{"text":"Really? I'm confused by all the glowing reviews. Brio is basically a glorified OG. Everything stinks of a chain Italian restaurant. I did appreciate the fact that they were very accommodating to our need for a speedy lunch. I had a flat bread pizza which was just fine. Tasted nothing like a true Neopolitan thin crust pizza, but its bastardized Italian food and for what it was it was just fine. If you're a fan of the OG this may be the place for you- plus they have a fantastic patio for outdoor dining."}
{"text":"People! What is the infatuation with kale?  I had brunch today and ordered the brunch bowl. It was very good, however, why screw up great taste with bitter nasty kale?  I picked the kale out and enjoyed the rest of the dish immensely. Nice service staff. I definitely recommend Brio for a charming, relaxed and enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Had dinner here Saturday night and the evening couldn't have gone better.  Our server, Amit, was excellent...personable and attentive without being intrusive.  Made sure everything was on time and just as ordered.  (Would return just to have him serve us again!)  Our meals (pesto pasta, Mediterranean shrimp special and chicken ravioli) were excellent and it was pleasant eating outside.  Glad to see the uncomfortable chairs have been replaced."}
{"text":"i went here will not go back. went with a party of 12. really lousy servixe i ordered veal parmesan it was greasy taisted bad was really a thin slice and the sause taisted canned. we also order seafood fettuccine and it taisted good but  uhhhh where was the seafood? also when i asked the waitress why she kept walking away and not take my order. she said because she didnt like me. Id like to add to this review i received a call from the manager it was sort of strange and hanging said he would call back but never did. I pray i never have to spend good money at this place again. Portions were just cheap."}
{"text":"I would give this place more than five stars if I could. The food is so delicious, and their outside patio is awesome! I love the pasta alla vodka. They have so many amazing appetizers too. The shrimp and eggplant, and calamari are my favorites. The service here is beyond great. My husband and I spent three hours here on our first date, and eat here at least once a month.  Everything has always been perfect."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for pasta and pizza, so Brio is totally my place! I lunched here a few days ago with my fiancé and his brother. We snagged a table outside and, even though it was blazing hot, we were kept cool by their awesome little misting machines built into the fence. Our waitress was Dominique and she was adorable and very friendly. 

We ordered the Beef Carpaccio to start and it was fantastic. I ordered a flatbread pizza and was pleasantly surprised-- I was expecting a long, thin flatbread with toppings, but I actually received a cracker thin crust pizza with gooey, browned cheese and crisp pepperonis. Delish! We also ordered mimosas, but they weren't very cold... but that's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Ate here for the very first time and it was absolutely delicious! When we arrived we were greeted and seated right away by the Hostess. 
 I had the Blackened Tilapia with grilled veggies which was cooked to perfection. Our waiter was very attentive and was super friendly! I love the ambiance of the restaurant and I look forward to dining here again especially for the price."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night it was pretty busy since it's the holidays... It's more of a casual dressy type of place... Our server was very slow he only came by twice to refill our water... We received bread and butter when we got there the food itself came by really fast... I ordered the shrimp and lobster fettuccine which was delicious the lobster bisque perfect for the cold weather. The truck did a great job the only reason it's getting a four stars instead of five because of our server I could  have died of dehydration!!!"}
{"text":"Lunch special was an angel hair pasta was really tasty and the shrimp was very fresh. I had the Eggplant Parmesan which was nice & crusty per the menu description with a very light marinara sauce but the buttered pasta on the side was not hot enough. Disappointing. Service is excellent, we got our food quickly.  We ordered the dessert sampler but they were out of the creme brulee and the server was very gracious and was offering us a good choice of substitution.  We ended up ordering the tiramisu which was very delightful!!!  A definite must try place!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. If you want to be ignored this is the place to go. The one and only \"Hostess\" decided to flirt/chat with servers and forgot about the people in the lobby. 
Our server noticed we had kids and kind enough to get us child menus."}
{"text":"Filthy, nasty, dirty, gross.  The cleanliness standards I experienced with my glass reminded me of a Texaco latrine.

 I was served a glass that was disgusting inside, the coup de grace was a 3/4\" booger-looking thing that I didn't notice until the diet Coke was consumed below the yellow and black organic mass approximately 1\" below the top of the glass.  Upon seeing that vile thing in my drink, I immediately noticed that the rest of the glass was nasty and appeared unwashed before coming back out to me.  I tried to go on with the meal but lost my appetite.  That glass was the most filthy thing I've ever been served in a restaurant or at any meal as far at that goes -and I've lived in Africa where hygiene is a luxury in some places.  I'm still trying to get the image out of my mind and feel sick that I drank from that glass.

This indicates a total breakdown in cleanliness standards.  From the dish washer to the soda fountain operator, anyone should have seen that the glass was nasty but failed to do so and served it to me anyway.

My wife still enjoyed her meal, and it was 3 stars by itself (pumpkin ravioli special).  We made sure to leave a good tip for our waitress because she did a great job under difficult circumstances.

The restaurant didn't charge me for the food I couldn't eat after the nasty; however, they didn't comp us anything for ruining my anniversary lunch.  I try to be gracious when this happens, but wow, that was disgusting."}
{"text":"Love the brunch on the patio. The salmon salad with shoestring potatoes just hits the spot. The egg whites vegetable omelet with fresh salsa is one of the best egg white choices out there."}
{"text":"Had dinner, lunch and brunch here many times. Food is always good, servers are great and there are no surprises. I've also been to parties there and the restaurant is always accommodating in the back room."}
{"text":"My husband and I love coming here for the chicken limone. They also have a fantastic happy hour - the peach sangria is the best. You need to show up before 5 to get a table because it's popular, but well worth it. We've taken our parents a couple of times and they went on and on about how good everything was."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere at Brio.  Although it IS indeed a chain, which is not my favorite part of a restaurant, it is still nicer than your average.

Their outdoor seating is spectacular.  The misters make it bearable to sit in the summer Vegas heat, the fire pits are great for the cooler evenings.

The food is pretty solid - I love their entree sized salads.  I can't comment on cocktails or desserts, as I've never had one there, but I'm guessing it'll push above average.

Overall, it was a great place for chilling on the patio or for a business lunch."}
{"text":"My family and I went to Brio for a nice Sunday lunch. The food is always good and I love the atmosphere. They gave my daughter some dough to make her own pizza. when she was done they brought back a mini pizza with olives as eyes and pepperoni as a mouth! She loved it! The only downer to a nice lunch was that the restaurant seemed to be COVERED in dust! Even the cloth napkins had dust/lint on them. Not very appetizing to say the least. Brio, please do some dusting and we will be back again!"}
{"text":"I ate here with a few friends. I had a salmon dish and it tasted great. The service was awesome, we showed up about thirty minutes before closing and the server was patient with us and made us feel right at home. We were the last ones out of the restaurant. I definitely will come back."}
{"text":"I must admit, I had high hopes for this place... and given the posh, upscale atmosphere, I was ready to be wowed. The only \"wow\" I had, however, was at how disappointed I was.

The food was far from spectacular; my Caesar salad had very little flavor (even for a Caesar salad,) and my eggplant pomodoro had just barely enough sauce to get some with each bite. The flavor on this, as well, was somewhat lacking. The spaghettini which came with it, however, was well presented and had a nice fresh flavor.

Then, of course, there was the service. I would highly recommend NOT going here for a quick lunch. We ended up being there for nearly two hours, 30 minutes of which was waiting for our check. In addition, the server was rather brusque when my friend asked for recommendations.

Overall, definitely not impressed. For as lavish as the decor is, and given the prices on the menu, I was expecting far better. Most certainly not recommended."}
{"text":"Went for dinner at Brio after a symphony at Tivoli event, I had made reservations. Once at the restaurant thank God for the reservation because it was extremely busy, the hostess was a little on the not so nice side but it was fine, we waited for about 15minutes and then got seated. We ordered the eggplant with shrimp and oh my God this appetizer is delicious. For dinner I got the salmon dish which was pretty good and the bf got the shrimp and lobster fettuccine which was delicious also. Definitely recommend this place, food is great."}
{"text":"Always a great experience when I come here. The staff knows their stuff! They're always friendly and helpful. The interactions are nothing but genuine and the atmosphere is awesome. Keep up the good work all!"}
{"text":"Shoutout to Gail for her excellent service!

The generous serving of Bruschetta Sampler was visually appealing and worth every bite. Tummy wishes fulfilled! It was \"molto delizioso\"!

I ordered the very appetizing and Strawberry Balsamic Salmon Salad, served with mixed greens, grilled-to-perfection salmon, grapes, Gordonzola and herb vinaigrette. Can a fish dish be refreshing? Yes!

My friend ordered the Mezza Chicken Limone (middle picture) with capers, lemon, roasted vegetables, and Yukon Gold mashed potatoes. Lovely!

Another friend ordered the Shrimp Mediterranean (top photo). Spicy, grilled shrimps served with orzo, farro, broccoli, asparagus, tomatoes, spinach, Feta, and drizzled with pesto vinaigrette. Mouth-watering!

I recommend this lovely eat-to-your-heart's-content restaurant in lovely Tivoli Village. Bring your visiting friends & family. They will enjoy it as much as you!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and really like it.

The food I've ordered has been really good.  They have a big menu with a ton of choices, which is always nice.  Even their dessert has a nice selection that compliments coffee or tea perfectly.

The restaurant itself is really nice too.  Its typical Tuscon decoration but it goes above and beyond.  

I've always had good service here so I have no complaints about that (lets face it, any restaurant can have a bad waiter at any time).

There is patio dining as well which I like because I love to people watch.

It is a little bit pricy, but the food quality is better than most. 

All in all Brio is enjoyable."}
{"text":"Yes, its a chain restaurant, but probably one of the best ones that makes you feel like you are fine dining. 

Although there is always a wait at the Town Square location, its worth it. 
The carpaccio is one of best in the city... Don't be shocked when you see the platter it is served on.. For a meal for one, it's perfect. 
My friends had the grilled salmon and pasta. No complaints.. 
As for the kids menu, WOW... a large selection with great portions to eat now, and lunch for tomorrow. 
The service was great, and I love the decor! Great place for a nice family dinner!"}
{"text":"One word...\"Bleh\".

I am thinking this is a place where writing a positive review is a condition of employment or something.  However, I do see that many reviews are for \"Happy Hour\".

My buddies and I took the 129 reviews and a 4 star rating as a guide but were incredibly turned-off.  Really a shame as we didn't have many opportunities to meet-up for dinner on the trip.

Decor like a typical pre-fab faux everything chain restaurant (which I later learned to be true).

Service  by a clueless 12 year-old.  Very sweet girl but clearly overwhelmed and not supported by any of the \"managers\" walking around trying to look cool.  No server assistant help either (we had to pile-up plates for them to figure-out it might be a good idea to remove them).

Food was horrible.  Yeah, not overly expensive, but how hard is it to make this kind of basic Northern Italian fare decent...if not great?  The bread is a joke, the noodles I had asked for as a substitute for mashed potatoes (yup) were dried out from sitting in the pass under a light too long, etc.  Really pathetic.

Oh well, we should have veered away when we saw it is attached to a shopping mall area.  Our fault (and the reviewers on Yelp sad to say).

So, veer...veer at all costs."}
{"text":"Elegant atmosphere and nice presentation of dishes. Sausage and spaghetti has great hearty flavor and chef Gustavo also will do custom dishes as well. He wants everyone to fully enjoy their dish and he is seen out greeting patrons. Good food with him there!!!"}
{"text":"Ambiance is exceptional, just wished the food matched.  Food is underwhelming."}
{"text":"My first time here was on a somewhat windy Thursday. There were 3 groups of people ahead of us and the restaurant was just opening; it was 11 AM.

We were asked where we wanted to sit, and we said outside for who knows what reason since it was quite windy that day. Our meal was delicious. I don't know the names of the two breads they put on the table, but they were really good! 

I spent approximately $60 for two people, during lunch. This included a shared appetizer, beverages, and 2 orders from the lunch menu. I haven't tried the dinner service at this location."}
{"text":"I was posting another review and came across a rather poor review for Brio.  I have been here about 6 times, but have never ordered a real meal.  We are more of the order 6 appetizers and drink a bottle of wine crowd, so I can really only comment on the service, apps, and wine.  Service has ALWAYS been great.  Never had an issue, or a wrong order, anything like that.  Everyone has always been friendly and competent.  The wine list is very good, and I am a wine snob.  Always served at the correct temperature, and nice selection.  The appetizers have always been really good - we especially like the seared scallops, gorgonzola lamb chops, beef carpaccio, and the lobster bisque soup!  Don't let the mediocre reviews here scare you away from trying it... pick a nice night and sit outside on the patio!!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Service was good and food moderately priced.  More of an open concept, so it is loud depending on the night.  I order the crusted filet and it was great.  I'd go there again."}
{"text":"June 10 was my first time at Brio as I was here for a family friend's high school graduation party. For my first time, it wasn't bad, but since there were so many of us in our group, it took a long time for our food and drinks to come out.
Though it was on a Saturday night, parking was decent and the restaurant wasn't really all that busy. Whether it's for another graduation party or a different event, I'll be back another day."}
{"text":"Very Nice place,so good service-fast and friendly staff,pretty view,food is delicious a specially bisque soup.so good for brunch and dinner"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner with the family or a group of people. The food was very good. I would definately recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is another one of those places I've visited a dozen times or more in a variety of locations, but seem to fail to check in most of the time.  The accumulated experiences mandate that it's time for a review.

For a chain, I think it's one of the better ones.  Brio's food is consistently good and most of the time, above average for a chain restaurant.  We find ourselves going there with some frequency lately since this location is just a few miles from the house, in the nearby and still growing Tivoli Village.  Easy to get to, great underground parking (a huge plus in the summertime!), and a nice place to stroll after overeating.  (Yep, it's gonna happen.)

The food:  Two visits ago I had the Pasta Fra Diavalo.  Not my first pasta dish here because they do a great job with not overcooking the pasta.  The flavors were wonderful as alway and the dish was served at just the right temperature.  I don't know if they heat their dishes, but I noticed that the bowl didn't cause the pasta to cool rapidly--something that happens too often at many restaurants.  During my most recent visit I was able to sample a number of new tasty menu items:  a fresh Caprese Salad.  It was especially specially fresh and had just the right amount of dressing to allow the mild tomatoes and mozzarella to shine through.  Next the group of us shared a Sausage and Pepperoni Flatbread, cooked well so that the flatbread was at just the right place between soft and too crisp.  Next, Black Pepper Shrimp featuring middle-sized, peeled shrimp served on slices of eggplant and drizzled in a fantastic sauce.  Brio found a great way to combine shrimp and eggplant into what became an instant favorite.  I'll definitely order it again.  I sampled Brio's take on bread pudding for dessert and was pleasantly surprised.  I wouldn't normally order bread pudding, but I'm glad I had the chance to try this.  The portion was just right to follow a full meal and the pudding and sauce were delicious.  I'd definitely get it again.

The beverages:  If you're in the mood for a little wine with your dinner, I recommend the White Peach Sangria.  I'm not a fan of sweet wines or drinks, but this was nice and refreshing, and not too sweet to keep me from enjoying it.

The service:  Top notch for this kind of restaurant.  The staff is always there taking care of you, but they're not in the way or hovering.  I also love that they'll always tell you the specials, then make recommendations if you prefer.  I almost always ask and when recommendations come, they seem genuine rather than what might otherwise feel like they were told to push a particular dish that day.

Overall, well done Brio!"}
{"text":"Updating my last review from three stars to five. After a rocky service on my birthday a few months back, my family and I decided to give Brio another go. The experience was just like the Brio I remember and used to frequent so often. Jessie the manager made sure to make everything right and went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience. Our waiter was so friendly and funny which really made the experience that much better. Kudos to Brio for doing it right and for reassuring me that this is definitely my forever go to destination for weekly girls cocktail nights and business lunches. All of their food is amazing and I'm glad this was such a pleasurable experience. They have excellent misters so don't be shy about sitting on the patio to enjoy a nice dinner or app."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend yesterday, our first time visiting. We ordered from the happy hour menu - and absolutely loved it! Food was great, drinks were great and the prices were surprisingly really well-priced. We also really loved the way it's decorated inside, beautiful atmosphere. Our server was excellent as well! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Went here with the family while checking out Scottsdale Quarter. Food was great. Service was good. Only thing lacking was selection of draft beer."}
{"text":"Came across this place while strolling in Town Square.  It was a perfect day for the patio so we sat outside.  The shrimp Mediterranean, lobster ravioli, and creme brûlée were delicious!  Service was really nice too!  My only complaint is that the lemonade tasted like a cup of sugar, but I generally dislike sweet drinks.  An umbrella toppled over onto another table due to strong winds that day, but luckily no major injuries.  Be careful of those desert winds!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good atmosphere. 3 stars only because I don't consider Brio's fine dining, but never had a bad experience there. Good portions as well."}
{"text":"Brio is absolutely AMAZINGGGG!!! We love bringing all of our out of town guests here. The happy hour is just so HAPPY! We love the Tivolli location because of the cuteness factor! The drinks and food are great! 
One little thing did happen last time we were in which NEVER EVER happens. They were out of our favorite dish :( the beef carpaccio. It was so sad because we normally both order one. It was still a great evening and we will be back soon for the beef carpaccio!!!"}
{"text":"I had brunch at Brio in town center this morning for a baby shower. I was with a large party and they accommodated us well, with plenty seating available for our large party and even a side table for the gifts and baby shower games. Service was prompt, and the food came out quick enough and servers were knowledgable on the menu. The cocktails I had were delicious and the food was good, however I could not tell you my servers name because he never gave it. Overall everything was \"good\", not great."}
{"text":"We had reservations but arrived earlier and were immediately taken to our table. The server arrived and took our drink order. We decided to have cocktails since they looked appealing on their promotional menu. We ordered the Berry Cooler and the Berry Cosmo and my gosh, were they disgusting! They tasted like chilled cough syrup. I asked my husband to let me try his and it was actually worse! So definitely a thumbs down on those! We ordered the Pasta Alla Vodka with shrimp and the Salmon Strawberry Balsamic salad. These dishes were amazing, totally made up for the crappy drinks we ordered (which were still at our table not to be touched)

Overall it was a good experience, we'd definitely go back. We just won't be ordering any mixed drinks"}
{"text":"Just had another great meal / great drinks sesh. Love this place always come back here."}
{"text":"Same compliments I sent to the restaurant as well:

This was our first visit to Brio and we were so impressed. Everyone was so friendly and warm and our server, Alicia was fantastic. She described the menu to us with great detail and almost making it hard to decide because everything sounded so good! We were so grateful Alicia told us about the Summer special (Chicken Milanese and Lasagne) helping make it easier to decide since it was such a good value. She was so knowledgable about everything the restaraunt offered, the menu and how the food was prepared. Way more than we could have asked for, but such a pleasant surprise. I don't usually expect spectacular service at restaraunts, but typically decent at least. She blew me away with her service skills. I am so happy about this awesome experience, excellent service and delicious food. I can't wait to tell my friends, post on Yelp and come back to visit! Thank you so much! Worth every penny I spent in your restaurant tonight!"}
{"text":"I would be such a happy camper if this restaurant chain opened up in California!  Their remoulade sauce and calamari is divine.  The shrimp and crabcakes with perfectly roasted vegetables (carrots, onions, peppers, asparagus, zucchini, etc.) are clean-your-plate ridiculous.  The cheesecake alone rivals the best with its cracked sugar crust, creme anglaise and peach melba (sweet raspberry) sauce drizzled all over its decadent behind.  Aww such bliss exists truly in a well prepared dinner!  The staff is also attentive and aware when you want to have a quiet moment or a full on party...."}
{"text":"This place is a ten out of ten. The outdoor seating is beautiful (fire pits, outdoor couch/chair arrangements, beautiful lighting) indoor looks like a palace. Service was above and beyond. We were treated like royalty. If you are in Town Square, this is an absolute must try."}
{"text":"Giving a five star review for the exceptional service we received from Jenna the manager and Mauricio who helped make things run smoothly. During Fathers Day we expected it to be busy and it was. The food tasted great and Jenna rescued the afternoon after several mishaps. So appreciated her helping us out and restoring the celebration."}
{"text":"Brio has a great happy hour. It is only valid in the bar and patio area, but the weather is perfect to sit outside right now and it makes for great people watching. You can't go wrong with the Tuscan Tasters for $3.95 each. My favorite is the shrimp and eggplant. Best part of the meal was our waitress, Kimberly. She was so personable and had great recommendations on everything from which Sangria to chose to dipping the hamburger in the sauce that comes with the shrimp and eggplant. We will definitely be back.. And will request Kimberly."}
{"text":"Food was great.... service was horrible!  I've eaten at Brio many times and always love the place.

I went with my daughter yesterday for dinner. We were promptly seated by the host. We waited 10 mins for our waiter to come over. She took our order. We never got bread. Our drinks came timely. Got our appitizers timely. Main course took forever! And the waiter never came back! I sat there with no drink refill for 45 minutes. We literally never saw our waitress after she delivered our drinks (meals are brought by other staff). I had to ask another waiter for our check and he tell us \"sorry I'm not your waiter\". He gets our waiter and she brings the check over. I put my credit card in it and leave it on the table. 20 minutes go by and she still doesn't take it!!! Rediculous!

Did I leave a tip... yes I did... $0.01. That's right I left a 1 cent tip because that's all this waitress deserved!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Eveytime I come to Las Vegas I stop here!"}
{"text":"I hate to say this, but this place is lame.

We made reservations for 5 at 8:30. We came in and waited to be seated. There was no host/hostess at the front. Waited for a solid 10 minutes and finally 2 hostesses came and apologized for the wait. Why are there 2 hostesses if they are BOTH going to be occupied at the same time? Fine whatever.

Got seated outside. We made reservations for 5. Got four plates and sets. I asked for one more set... And I got the \"Oh did I miss a set?\" Yes you did. No biggie. 

Service is really bad. Not even mediocre, bad. Waited forever to get our orders in, very disappointing. I ordered the lasagna, but 20 mins into it (after we were served calamari and carpacciio, the only decent items on the menu), they came in to let me know they ran out. 20 mins later? Whatever, fine. They told me they could make me a spaghetti with bolognese sauce. I opted for that. Everyone's meal came earlier and they all waited for mine to come out (even though I insisted they go ahead and eat). I finally got this \"bolognese\" but it was like a pasta stew. Everyone knows bolognese is meat sauce and it's not supposed to be mushy and soggy and filled with sauce, but meat. It looked like they threw on the lasagna ragu. It was terrible! Even the meat of the sauce was not edible.

At this point I was done. My mother insisted that I let them know I didn't get what I ordered. I assumed that my voice wouldn't be heard considered the already bad service... but the Manager was the only redeeming quality of this joint: She offered an apology (that's all I expected), and dessert around the table. She didn't have to do that and that was nice. For that, they get one star.

Without it, it wouldn't be anything.

I would NOT come back here again and do not recommend this place for anyone who wants a romantic or nice italian experience. Bad food, bad service."}
{"text":"Food tasted good and was presented very well, however, I am a Celiac and asked for gluten free. Didn't get it. Was sick immediately after leaving restaurant.
Jesse, the restaurant manager contacted me immediately. I'm sure she will make sure this doesn't happen again. I'll be going back for a gluten free experience."}
{"text":"Stopped here with some friends on a Friday evening. The waitress was attentive and friendly without being overbearing. We were seated immediately and water and bread were out for everyone right away while we perused the menus. I ordered a steak and a salad and both were very good and reasonably priced.

We noticed as we were leaving there was a cool outdoor patio with a fire going. Wish we would have stopped out there for a drink. Looked nice."}
{"text":"This is an excellent go-to spot for dinner after enjoying a night at TownSquare.   I have ate here with my wife and kids on multiple occasions without ever being disappointed.   

What we ordered on our most recent visit:

1) Shrimp Risotto with Lobster Tail - 
2) Lobster Bisque
3) Grilled Salmon off the kids' menu
4) Cheese Pizza off the kids' menu
5) Crab Cake as a added side

While some reviews will say the menu is hit-or-miss, you will be happy if you ordered any of the above items.  The lobster bisque was delicious with a good amount of actual lobster in the soup.  The complimentary bread initially served upon being seated was great for dipping into it. 

The shrimp risotto and lobster tail was excellent.  The lobster tail was mouth-watering and the cheesy risotto was bedded with a generous amount of great-sized shrimp.   My kids' loved their dishes and the crab cake, albeit on the small side, was very tasty and not expensive.

The ambience inside the restaurant is nice enough for a romantic date for two but also enjoyable for families or a group of friends.  On Tuesday's starting at 5pm until 9pm, live music is provided which elevates the entire dining experience.   Loud, but not loud enough where you can't make audible conversation at the table.

Our servers have always been well accommodating to our every need.   We have had no problems here.

I will add that on previous visits I've also had a good experience ordering the beef carpaccio, caprese salad, brio steak salad, as well as the chicken limone.   While others might have said  'hit or miss' I've come to note that their menu so far has been one giant bullseye."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had a breeze getting seated. 

I really like the fact that our server was knowledgeable of the wine list because I am one to appreciate a good bottle of wine. She suggested the White Oak Chardonnay and to my surprise, I fell in love with it. 

The slice steak bruschetta is a must try!! The steak and cheese complemented each other quite nicely if I may add. 

I ordered the chicken piccata which I felt like you could never go wrong with. It was mediocre. There wasn't flavor that really stood out for me. The salmon has a good amount of seasoning on it which enhanced the flavor of the fish. 

Last but not least, the dessert menu! The caramel mascarpone cheesecake won me over! It was simply to die for! 

I can honestly say that Brio did not disappoint! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Five minutes after submitting the below review, I received a call from Jesse the General Manager.  He was very apologetic for our experience, and promised the service would improve.  So, I will be coming back with a follow up review after we visit gain, but I do have to give cud-dos to Jesse for the quick response to my email.

Never again will I visit this location on a busy night with or with out a reservation.  I am so frustrated with the service we received at the Tivoli Village location.  First of all, we had a reservation for 7pm last night which I had made on Open Table.  We arrived at 6:50pm and were told it would just be a few minutes.  We told the hostess we would wait in the bar and we ordered a bottle of wine with the intention of having a glass and taking it to our table.  

By 7:30 pm, we went back to the hostess and told her we were still waiting.  She told us that were a couple of people ahead of us still, so we returned back to our seats at the bar.  At 7:40pm, our bartender Jose notified Jennifer (I believe, tall brunette lady working the bar) that we were still waiting.  She immediately contacted a manager (didn't talk to us, did this on her own initiative) who told her (and then she told us) that we would be next.  Finally, a bottle of wine down, we were seated at 7:55pm for our 7pm reservation.  

I finally asked for a manager and was greeted by a manger (he didn't introduce his name) and voiced my frustration about the delay.  He told me that \"we are busy today\" and offered an appetizer which neither my date or I were interested in.  Instead, we told him we were ready to order and would like to order a bottle of wine (I made it clear we didn't want a free bottle)  but again had to wait nearly fifteen minutes for a bottle.  

Anyhow, the risotto I had tasted hot but tasted as if it had been cooked early in the day and had been reheated several times.  Honestly, the whole experience was rushed and non romantic.  I was treated as number, and not as a customer.  Horrible experience, and the lack of remorse from the management really made this a bad experience that we will not repeat."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience there last night. Our server Jessica was very attentive and quite friendly.  Jessica made sure our glasses were never empty as well as checked up on us along with Jenna the entire time.  

My lobster and shrimp fettuccine was amazing, and the pasta was very fresh.  The sweet potato rosetteo was also amazing.  Finally, we couldn't have picked a better ending with the butterscotch pudding.

I have to say, this location is my favorite of all the Brios!"}
{"text":"Food and service here are fantastic. The managers are hospitable. The bar staff always makes me feel like a regular."}
{"text":"A great place for Happy Hour, sit around a high top, and chat and mingle.  My Red Sangria and Burger were okay, maybe I should have ordered less standard fare.  Next time!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: great. Appetizers: also good. The wine list: abysmal. Nothing under $50 was even drinkable. And everything over $50 was grossly overpriced. They have no sommelier on staff either. Next time, I'll just stop by Total Wine around the corner and pay a corkage fee.

Probably the BEST table bread I've had anywhere in The Valley. It was the closest thing to a real sourdough available in this state. Very tasty, and worth a visit just for that.

We had a horribly novice server that made the beginning of our meal frustrating. However, we complained to the manager, and then suddenly we had people falling all over themselves to take care of us. Good save, Brio.

The entrees were also a good save. The whole demeanor of our table changed when the main courses arrived. Wow, everything was really great. Good quality, good flavor, good presentation. We were delighted. The food was definitely a notch above any of the other Italian restaurants around.

Overall, not a bad choice if you live in the area. I don't know if it's worth a long drive, but it's a solid restaurant. Frankly, it's probably at least 4-Star worthy, but too many things went wrong on our first visit. Still, I'll be back (and hopefully be able to bump it up another star afterward)."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location 4 times now and have had an enjoyable experience each time. Yes, it is a chain. It does not try to be, nor claim to be a locally owned & operated restaurant. That being said, it is a very nice chain restaurant with a slightly upscale feel with lovely decor. I always order the Pasta Fra Diavolo with shrimp and have them add mushrooms to it. I like my diavolo sauce extra spicy so I also add some crushed red pepper which gives it a nice kick! It's a great dish so I don't bother ordering anything else. My dining companions have recommended the crab & shrimp cakes & the grilled salmon as well. The bread basket is also delicious, but be careful not to fill up on it! It's tempting, trust me!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Amazing food! Sat in the bar area on 10/17 got here around 8:10pm, everything seem to start off right bartender greeted me within 2 mins, gave me a happy hour menu. I ordered from the happy hour menu and my bartender walked away when he brought my drink over I had to ask for the regular menu. I ordered an Cesar salad, flat bread and lamb chops to eat. All my food came out in an timely manner but my bartender NEVER checked on me. My lamb chops were VERY tasty but came out cold. I had to physically get up and find an manager to come talk to in which they remade my lamb chops and they came out nice and hot! My bartender was aware that I sent back my dish but never followed up. The manager did come back within mins to check on me! Since it was extremely slow and the service suck that's my reason for two stars, I really wanted to rate 1 but the food was too good"}
{"text":"A nice place, with a good location. I liked the atmosphere, the food, and the service! Started with the Kale Caesar Salad, which was tasty. Then, I had the Lasagna Bolognese, which was also very good. A nice, balanced flavor. The Caramel Mascarpone Cheesecake was very light for a cheesecake, so it didn't fee like a brick in my stomach. I enjoyed it! Overall, I really liked Brio. You won't feel awkward if you dress up, or dress down. Definitely, give it a try!"}
{"text":"** YELP 100 CHALLENGE: 046/100 **

On our last Vegas trip, my boyfriend and I were in the plaza planning to watch Captain America: The Winter Soldier. We were starving, so we decided to look for somewhere to eat afterwards. Using my trusty Yelp app, I found that Brio Tuscan Grille was one of the highest rated restaurants in the plaza that was still open at that hour, so off we went!

The ambience and decor of Brio Tuscan Grille felt very classy and upscale. We weren't too dressed up, so we felt slightly out of place. However, our service remained top notch, and everyone was very nice, friendly, and attentive. Brio Tuscan Grille is a great place I'd recommend if you want a hearty Italian dinner. My boyfriend and I loved everything we ordered, which was the following:

-Roasted Garlic, Spinach, and Artichoke Dip: One of my favorite appetizers, so I usually always order this.. and Brio's is definitely one of my favorites I've had so far! The Parmesan flatbread they provide for dipping tasted so cheesy, crisp, and perfect. It was a good blend of flavors with the spinach dip, which was neither too salty or bland. Usually restaurants serve tortilla chips with spinach/artichoke dip, so I thought Brio's upgrade to parmesan flatbread was a very nice touch. Highly recommend!
- Lobster Bisque: Very creamy and filling. The lobster bisque I've had in the past had a stronger tomato, tangy taste. Brio's version is definitely more creamy and thick. While I liked it, it was probably too heavy to eat in conjunction with the spinach/artichoke dip.
- Pasta BRIO: I honestly don't remember this dish too well, since it's been months. However, we ordered this to share per recommendation of our server. I do remember the sauce being very savory and delicious, and I most likely enjoyed it. It's supposedly their signature dish, so I assume it's one of their more popular pastas.

Overall, I enjoyed my first dining experience at Brio Tuscan Grille. I usually don't like eating at Italian restaurants, because I'm never blown away by their dishes. However, Brio exceeded my expectations, and I highly recommend it to anyone in the area. If you're fan of spinach/artichoke dip, definitely order this as well!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Our server Cinamin was friendly. The restaurant setting is absolutely beautiful especially outside on the patio. Personally, for my taste, the food lacks something. I had the chicken limone and just thought the chicken lacked seasoning. However I did enjoy the shrimp and eggplant appetizer as well as the white sangria."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Made a reservation.  Waited almost  15  minutes to be seated.  Was then brought to a table near the kitchen doors and a service computer.  Refused that table and we were told they don't  take reservations.  The tables are on first come first  serve basis.  We were then given a different table.  Seated and waited 10 minutes before our server appeared to take out drink order.  No bread was served.  We asked twice before we finally received the bread. 

Food was good but service definitely did leave something to be desired. Granted the restaurant was busy but no excuse for slow and poor service."}
{"text":"I'm starting to get mixed feelings about this place.  I was first introduced to Brio a year ago when I was in Dallas.  Since then, when there is a Brio near where I'm going, I always make reservations.  

This is the 2nd time I went to Brio at this shopping center.  1st time was OK except when I ordered a glass of house Cabernet and have to ask 2 times and never got.  When I was charged, the waiter asked if I wanted to take my wine to go.  I thought really????  Wine to go???  I told the waiter to just cancel the wine and give me a new bill. 

My daughter and I ordered the following:

Glass house Malbec ($10): if they are going to serve a glass of wine, either serve it 1/2 the glass or serve it in smaller wine glasses.  See my picture, I got 1/4 glass.

Caesar salad ($5) - it didn't come with parmesan cheese.  who serves a Caesar salad with no parmesan cheese????  I had to ask for cheese twice. 

Campanelle Carbonara pasta ($20) - This is my all time favorite.  It comes with spinach, chicken and bacon.  I wanted to go vegetarian so I substituted the chicken and bacon with mushrooms. It was still really good. 

My daughter got the kids rigatoni with meat sauce ($7).  My daughter really liked it. 

I will definitely go back again but don't order wine and make sure that they put cheese on the Caesar salad."}
{"text":"This place has always had amazing service and food. We can only go when we're on vacation now because the last time we went we found that they have no phone service.  We have never had to use our phone until this time. When you're on call and the hospital calls, you can't be running around the building trying to get a connection. In case you need to though, head towards the Apple Store."}
{"text":"Went to Brio to celebrate my friends and my birthday. She arrived earlier than I, and sat for about 10 minutes without being greeted. I arrived and sat for another 5 minutes before our server finally came over and took our drink orders. We were pretty disappointed by this and asked to speak to a manager. The manager came and told us she'd get us another server. We sat for about five more minutes when our original server came back to bring us a bread basket, but not the drinks we had ordered. We were there for 20 minutes and couldn't even get water. We will never be back"}
{"text":"Literally had such an amazing server Gus!!! Went in on the 4th of July! We had happy hour right before it was over and he was awesome!! All of our drinks continued to be filled!! I never get such awesome service and as a server myself I am extremely picky! I live in Henderson so about 30 away from here but would come back for him!!!


Thanks;)"}
{"text":"I love Brio.  Their outdoor patio is so much fun when the weather is not hellfire.  I recommend that you sit on the patio, order a bottle of wine and cheese, and enjoy the best Las Vegas has to offer.  I've been to Brio numerous times and consistently had wonderful experiences.  

Only once was there something that concerned me (undercooked meat).  Should they have caught this problem before serving the food to my guests and me, yes.  However, the chef and server both apologized and made things rights.  No harm was done, and I've never had any other bad experiences.

This is a place I love to visit."}
{"text":"This is the go to place for my boyfriend and I when we want to have amazing food & look around townsquare. 



a month ago - I take off a star because the last time we were there we sat outside & had the worst service possible. We knew something was wrong when the hostess told the other hostess to sit us outside and she said, \" uhh you sure him?\" hah.The food was still amazing. Just the fact that it took them forever to bring us our wine at first & when we asked for the check ( From someone that wasn't our server, 'cause OUR server disappeared on us) it took longer as if we were waiting for more food!

We went to have brunch just this sunday and had a great time. I got the Eggs Oscar & he got the Chicken & Chorizo Benny. Add some coffee to the mix, Perfect. Server was awesome ( tall guy). 


All in all, we love this place & our last visit just solidifies why we always come back."}
{"text":"I have been dining here for about 2 years. The carpaccio, steak salad, & tomato soup are delicious. Happy Hour is wonderful for a meeting with friends. My family & I  return for the superb service.  We always request JOHN every time, he is a huge part of the reason we return quite often (so ask for John)."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here twice so far and definitely more to come! This place is amazing, super friendly service, great prices and tasty food. Even their children options are great priced and large portions. Sign up for their app to receive free items."}
{"text":"I liked the Town Square location the one or two times I was there. But the food I got at the Tivoli location was mediocre at best. The sweet potato and chicken risotto ($16.25) was gummy and tasted like paste. The fettuccine napoli ($15.95) was better, but nothing stellar. The best thing I tried was the kid's cheese pizza. Yeah, that means the place is kid friendly. The prices are reasonable -- although from what I hear happy hour is the best time to go since apps are $3 each."}
{"text":"I ate here on July 14. I had been wanting to try this place out forever. It took about 10 mins to seat us which was fine. It was just my son and I. My service was horrible through the entire meal. I'm surprised my server even showed up most of the time. My son ordered a cheeseburger that was charred and the bun was stale and crispy. I ordered a Caesar salad and the lobster with shrimp risotto. My salad never showed up and my risotto was still hard. The lobster was cooked perfectly. I will also add that my peach sangria was wonderful. Our deserts were pretty tasty. Overall I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Love this place!The decor is Tuscan and beautiful.Best lobster bisque ever!!!Warm and tasty bread basket accompanies the meal with delicious sourdough bread .Cant wait to get back here for happy hour soon."}
{"text":"Aweful!!! Literally tastes no better than my frozen Lean Cuisine lunches....and way over priced. I had the Pesce Picatta. Very bland! I had to add Parmesan, salt, pepper and squeezed a whole lemon on it. Helped a little bit not much. The fish tasted like a frozen fish stick and the pasta was very mushy!!  Italian restaurants should cook al dente. Ridiculous. I would NOT recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good place for sit down lunch l. Service is inconsistent, and will have a wait even if you see open tables. Liked the Roasted red peppers as an add on to meal."}
{"text":"Dinner last night was a big family gathering of 15 adults and 3 kids. We made reservations ahead of time (which was done by another family member and apparently was not the easiest reservation for some reason. The initial number kinda had a shocking effect on the restaurant -20 adults initially, not sure why). 
When I arrived, most of our family members were already there and had ordered appetizers and drinks. I ordered my main when everyone did so we could all eat at the same time. With too many good sounding options on the menu, it took me a while to decide what to order. Craving seafood and risotto, I decided to order one of the more expensive items on the menu, the shrimp and lobster tail risotto. My brother in law ordered the fillet minion and his wife ordered the shrimp and lobster fettuccini. Other members of the family ordered more dishes, if I saw correctly, one ordered the chicken risotto and one of the kids had an order of Mac & Cheese. There were chicken dishes ordered and pasta dishes and so and so forth. 
The food came out in a relatively good time, considering the size of our table. My dish was perfectly done. The risotto was creamy but with a slight bite to the rice, exactly the way it should be done. There was a decent amount of shrimp in the dish, maybe even a bit more than I expected. The dish might have been slightly over seasoned but for me, a person who always has to add salt to everything and likes bold flavors, this dish just nailed it. The veggies in the dish worked very well with the risotto, mushrooms, asparagus, roasted red peppers and tomatoes, everything tasted delicious. 
While my experience was great yesterday, I had to give the place 4 stars (and maybe could have gone for less if I tasted some of the other dishes). The comments on the table was \"something is missing, this dish isn't impressive\" that was for the shrimp and lobster fettuccini. Our second cousin who ordered the chicken risotto hardly ate any thing from it and refused to pack it and take it with her. The Mac and cheese from the kids menu came in an adult size dish with adult silverware and an adult size drink. This was kinda weird because everything ordered for the kids came out of the kids menu. Not complaining about their generosity but for a kid, this wasn't easy to eat, or drink! The fillet minion seems to have been ok, no complaints. 
Overall, my experience was great & service was excellent. Other members of the family, not too much, some may not even be returning to Brio because of the prices in comparison to the taste of the food. 
I think I would be returning with my husband next time (who couldn't join us yesterday unfortunately) and give some of their other dishes a try. I hope the other dishes will also be as good as the risotto!"}
{"text":"This place was alright. I had the chicken skewers and we got the bruschetta quattro for appetizers. The bruschetta was pretty good. The chicken skewers you practically inhale...i.e. small quantity. So I payed $16.50 for these and there were like three wimpy chicken breasts on sticks with a mediocre amount of wild rice. I don't know, maybe this is to be expected from a place that seems to go more for appeal rather than food quality. It's definitely trying to take its place in Scottsdale as the cooler, classier version of the Cheesecake Factory. It definitely doesn't match up in terms of food, and I won't comment on the service because i've only been here once and maybe I had a sub-par waiter. The management is unorganized, but more on that later.

 My dad had two drinks and he loved them. That's about the only sure shot fired by this restaurant. But I mean it's alcohol... It's easy to enjoy alcohol. The generic cheesecake was also good. Again, it's easy to enjoy cheesecake. 

OK, onto the management. I understand that this restaurant is fairly new in Scottsdale so it's gonna be busy on the weekends. That doesn't give management an excuse to give out multiple reservations and not be able to give tables when people show up. OK, fifteen minute waits here and there with a reservation on Saturday is fine, but when it becomes a half an hour, you goofed up somewhere. I don't know who to bag on for this - the highschool hostesses, or the manager that trained them to figure out what time to tell callers when a reservation is available. A couple actually walked out after being waited for I don't know how long. The hostesses didn't even bother filling up the lounge. I'm sure if they told half the people that walked through that door that the lounge was free-for-all, first come first serve, same menu, same service, grab whatever table - the lounge would be filled. Instead people were getting tired of waiting, then asking what that table was doing empty. Then the highschool chick goes, \"Oh that's just the lounge, you can sit there if you want. Same menu, same service.\" WELL s#%t, thanks for telling us now. 

I hope if you try this place you get good service and the $16.50 plate you order isn't meant to nibble on."}
{"text":"This review is for happy hour in the bar only.  If you are lucky enough to grab a table inside or outside before 630 pm you are definitely set to enjoy a budget friendly happy hour.  It was a Wednesday night about 6pm I was lucky enough to grab a table in the bar area.  It was very busy.  There was some weird guy playing a guitar and singing to keep me and my friend entertained while we waited for the table to be cleared and cleaned.  Not sure if this is a regular thing for brio now providing live entertainment but it was the first I have seen. In any case he was ok, not terrible.  Lol. Our waitress I believe it was Monica K. ( at least that's the name on our receipt) was great!  She ended every sentence with...\"it's my pleasure\".  Even though it was obvious she was slammed, she never lost her cool and never lost her smile.  She came around to let us know last call for happy hour, which was greatly appreciated.  We ended up with three martinis, one spinach and artichoke dip, two brio burgers and one chocolate cake all for $40.87.  What a steal! Especially since the food is great too!  Burgers are juicy. They have a great variety of items on their happy hour food menu.  In addition to a happy hour drink menu, brio offers $5 martinis all day Wednesday's and $5 wines all days Thursday's. Give it a try and check it out. They have a big outdoor patio.  See you there!"}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant, the grilled mahi fish is always good as it is a specialty. WE have yet to have a bad experience, the staff is great and if you come early before 6:30 PM. Minimal  Waiting."}
{"text":"Have you ever gone to a dinner party & EVERYTHING tasted great...even though you had made that same thing yourself before and it was just OK?  That is how I feel about the food at Brio.  I have been to the new Tivoli location a few times now and love the happy hour. Be aware that because this is between Kona grill and Sun City, so there is a wide age range.  It had been a while since I had a 65 year old man hit on me, but it wasn't creepy...(is that creepy?).  Service is great each time but if you sit outside the sun just blares down during the happy hour.  The house white wine is nice and light and a reasonable price.  A nice place.  My friends and I really enjoy everything we have tried."}
{"text":"Not the best experience when they give you napkins to sit on cause the booth is so dirty. And then to find something in your salad that isn't supposed to be there...not a good experience. At least the company was good."}
{"text":"Came for friend's 21st birthday. Caesar salad was so garlicky that it was inedible and left a terrible taste to start off the evening. Carbonara \"lightly salted\" was delicious, but it appears the portions have gotten smaller. Our server was very attentive and kind. Offered a complimentary chocolate dessert for the birthday boy."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch. To begin, parking was obviously chaotic at the fun-filled Town Square. I parked far but enjoyed my stroll over to the restaurant. Once we got to the restaurant, we were asked to wait a few minutes to get our outside table ready. The restaurant is large and well-decorated. I loved the high ceilings and it could be the elder, classier sister of Cheesecake Factory. We asked to be seated outside and the waitress who walked us over was kind and let us pick the table we preferred. Our main waitress, Sophia, was on her third day at the job. She was kind, fun, and considerate. She was respectful and did her very best to provide suggestions and answer questions. The other waiters were very kind, too. The starter bread was awesome, especially the thin, crunchy triangular crackers. The food was good though it was a little cold and could have used more flavor. I got the Margherita flatbread while my friend got the Lasangna that came with a salad. Each of us paid roughly $15 for our meal. One thing I really liked about the restaurant was that the  menu had the calories written on it--helps a lot for the health-conscious people at an Italian restaurant! All in all, food was good but the experience is what would make us come back again. Fun place to do people-watching at, especially while sitting outside!"}
{"text":"I love brio so much it hurts. I always have great service. Professional, friendly and attentive! 
My husband and I frequent here for dinner dates since it was the location of our first date when I realized I needed this hunk in my life. 
We've sat outside and inside and at the bar and liked all areas. all their pastas are to die for and my husband usually gets the salmon I believe. Or some sort of fish entire. He always loves it.  
And for. The amazing service and quality of food its such a great price. 
I'm usually not a fan of chain restaurants but I love me some brio!!"}
{"text":"We ate here as part of a fixed-menu wedding reception dinner. 

Our servers were very attentive and we never had to wait long for one to come around. I had the Chicken Limone which came with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies (zucchini, carrots, broccoli). It was a MASSIVE portion. It was delightful. I had moscato to drink and as a non-wine person, also delightful. The appetizer was the parmesan flatbread with artichoke dip. It was yummy. The Caesar salad was on the sad side, but the rest of the meal made up for it. I have no idea if the cake we had was by Brio or if it was brought in, but it was also wonderful. 

If I was spending the day at the mall here, I would definitely stop by for dinner on my own dime."}
{"text":"It was our first time coming here for my sisters Birthday. The ambiance was great. The food was ok. The waitress was nice. My complain goes out to the Manager if I'm not mistaken her name was Ashley... from the moment we were seated til we left I observed her going to the surrounding tables greeting them asking how their food was and so forth ,new tables next to us were seated a couple of times and not once did she walk over to acknowledge us. Sounds petty but it left a bad impression being that it was our first time there. The waitress walked over to check on us and I said nicely \" What's the managers name the woman who's been walking over to these tables next to us acknowledging every other table besides ours? Is it because everyone else that's here is Caucasian and we're not? \" She said oh I'm sorry I'm sure that's not what it is, I know being minority it feels like a racial thing sometimes but I'm sure that's not what it is.\" I made it very clear that I never ever feel that way because I have a multi cultural family. She asked if I wanted her to address the issue and have her walk over and I refused it. I did not want her walking over to us just because I complained. 
As a manager your supposed to set an example for your staff and I think she did a poor job at that tonight. So thank you but no thank you we will not be coming back to your establish"}
{"text":"I love going to this place. I haven't had anything here that I didn't like. Their customer service on the other hand is a hit and miss :(

However, their food speaks for itself so it hasn't dampened my opinion of this place. 

I love their steak salad. It's very, very tasty. Just order the dressing on the side though. It's over powering if you let them mix it in, at least in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Husband got sick after eating dinner about a month ago. Our daughter and friend went yesterday and the food was awful. I don't usually write bad reviews but this is now twice the food was bad. Service was good and atmosphere was good. Really wished food had been good too."}
{"text":"Went to Brio for dinner early Sat. night. They were on a wait (of course) so we opted to sit in the Lounge. (I have heard  that they offer an awesome happy hour, apps are $2.95. I am looking forward to returning and taking advantage of that!)  Anyways.. This is my second time here and both times I have ordered the Pasta Alla Vodka. Absolutely Delicious!! It was so good, I don't want to venture out and try anything else on the menu!  Our server was great. It was a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Brio has a terrific happy hour that my wife and I always recommend. All the apps are great tasting and reasonably priced. Hard to believe it's a chain. The bartenders (Brendon gets a gold star) are courteous and remember your name. Good selection of reasonably priced wines with a few great bargains on the list. Too many good appetizers to have a favorite but we often order the carpaccio and shrimp and eggplant (we like sauce on the side) and we usually get a Bistecca salad which is really good. We often eat dinner at the bar because the bar staff is so friendly. Our favorite regular menu items are the shrimp risotto and the double cut pork chop. Lastly the management here really cares that you have a good time. Any missteps are usually taken care of without us ever having said a word."}
{"text":"Recently went for lunch with a couple of friends. Sat at the bar!  What a mistake!!! The food took forever to come out, and when it did it was cold. Sent it back, and took another fifteeen minutes. The bartenders were overwhelmed, and didn't seem to have enough help, came accross with attitude when they had to take the food back! Not a good day here!"}
{"text":"This place had some darn good food.  Ate here fir a friend's wedding rehearsal dinner and loved it.  The food was all amazing.  Great appetizers and meals portions are nice and large.  Drinks were good also and reasonable prices.

I had a great experience and would go here on dates regularly."}
{"text":"The unorganized front desk to check-in should have been a good indicator that the rest of the experience would be as bad as that was. Our waitress had to be hunted down by another waiter. During her first visit to our table we ordered drinks and our meals. 

The people that came in after us, and were  seated after us got there food 20 minutes before us. The waitress finally came by and joked about how long it was taking, yet offered no apologies. 

Now, I understand that it's a Sunday, and Valentine's Day, however a little more organization and consistency would have been nice.

This will be the last time I visit this restaurant due to the horrible experience. I do not recommend it to anyone anymore.

UPDATE: Someone from Brio replied to my review that they would message me. 6 days later, I'm still waiting for a message. They must be on the same schedule as the restaurant was that day."}
{"text":"Amazing service, excellent food, definitely will let everyone I know, locals and visitors to not look any further than Brio for an excellent meal. Brio has really met and exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Promise next time i will take a picture of the food.
Brio town square is my favorite location than the rampart one. half bar is inside the building half is \"outside\".
i Love their bar seating area where they offer a very nice Happy Hour deal from 3pm to 6:30pm monday to friday at the bar area only (at the bar or the 4 high tables by the bar or the couch facing the bar)
Love their sangria, white peach or red sangria. Robert handles the bar with his team and he is just Excellent at remembering what you like to drink! Is that bad when he sees you and already prepare your drink without asking?? 
They are so so busy at the bar, no matter what you always get a smile! 
Happy hour time I to order their beef carpaccio, captées salad, artichoke dips, sliders
The lobster bisque and the steak salad are to die for!
The main restaurant is very elegant and cosy! I love the decoration. To avoid the wait, you can always book your table :)
Staff is friendly. Good address in town for good food and great service!"}
{"text":"Came here two days in a row! First on a Friday during Happy hour with Nieves D. One of the best HH I've had. 

HH specials are for food & drinks and it's from $4-$6 which is a pretty good deal with the amount of food they give you! For foods we got Beef Cappaccio, Crispy Eggplant fries, black pepper shrimp, Crispy cheese ravioli, and Roasted garlic spinach artichoke dip. All oh so delicous! My favorite would have to be the Crispy eggplant fries which is pretty crazy because I do NOT like eggplant at all. Also I think the Crispy Cheese Ravioli was to die for. It wasn't too cheesy, it was the perfect amount of cheesiness! 

For drinks we got White Peach Sangria, Sangria Rosa, & Mango Mojito. I really liked the Sangria Rosa. Now it's really not real sangria because real sangria is fruits marinated in wine but they just put some fruit in a cup & add wine with vodka. Still good tho.

Best bartender there, hands down is Geoffrey. He accomodated each of our needs. When the door was open and the wind was blowing our hair all over our faces, he shut the doors. We were right under the AC vents which was blowing cold a** air right on top of us making us shiver uncontrollably, he made the waiters turn the vents off. He also made us his speciality shots, on the house! 

2nd time I went was the next day for brunch. Not as good as Happy Hour. I got the Salmon with Angel Hair with Lobster Bisque. Was not that good. It had a sauce that was kind of on the sour side.  & the lobster bisque was on the salty side. There was a fly buzzing around our table that was annoying me! 

This place would be a solid 5 star rating for me if I did not come back for brunch the next day. None the less, I would probably return for HH again!"}
{"text":"Went with my family last night for dinner and I was very underwhelmed. The server walked away so quickly after drink orders that I couldn't get in an order for an appetizer. The food was very mediocre, my asparagus had no life. When the food was delivered, all of our meals were given to the wrong person at the table..very odd. Overall, I was not impressed and don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"I tried Brio's offerings (bruschetta and mocha panna cotta) at the Yelp Ultimate Science Fair and was so impressed that I decided to go there last night. Let me start by saying that this place was exquisite and beautiful. I loved the drapery from the ceiling and all the decor. We started by using the free appetizer card we received from the party on Calamari with a lemon aioli some kind of chunky tomato sauce. Both the aioli and sauce were delicious, however, the calamari could have better. The batter was good but I think they were overcooked cause they were a bit rubbery. We also received a bread basket. While the sourdough bread was pretty good, the rosemary herb \"crackers\" were a waste I felt. For a meal, I ordered the mushroom ravioli while the hubby ordered the chicken Milanese. Both of us enjoyed our meals very much. Both were large portions which made the higher prices are little more worth it. For dessert, I decided to try the bread pudding since I am huge bread pudding connoisseur. I am on the fence about this one. In some areas, the texture and flavor was good. However, in other parts of the pudding, it was dry and no flavor really. Not sure what happened but definitely not making the list for the best bread puddings. The service was impeccable. Would I go back? Yes I would try it again because I really did like the mushroom ravioli and their bruschetta (if its always like it was at the party) is to die for!"}
{"text":"Okay experience. The food is really bland and overpriced. Also this location is not very well designed inside. Kinda felt like I was eating inside of an old casino. Service was great however, and their strawberry shortcake dessert was yummy."}
{"text":"So we are not big Town Square people, my man doesn't like crowds much so we don't go as often as I would like.  We were there for a specific item and decided to have a few drinks.  While having these drinks we wanted food.  Looking though the options we decided on Brio.  Which amazed and thrilled me, he doesn't like Italian (because he never knows what to order and picks the wrong stuff) I love Italian especially because I get it so rarely! 

I got the caesar salad, yummy.  Perfect amount of dressing to food.  He got the Wedge Bistecca Insalata, he loves wedges so he was happy.  He finally followed my lead and got what I ordered, the Lobster & Shrimp Fettuccine.  His mouth watered when he saw it and he finished my leftovers when we got home.  So finally we can eat Italian and he will be happy, I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love the food. The service is very good. So far one of the only places that prepare the Pasta just perfect. Down side is that its a bit pricy for pasta.
But I highly recommend it...dont forget the deserts are great.."}
{"text":"Best Brunch in Town and Always Outstanding Service!"}
{"text":"I'm here with my daughters and friends for my 50th birthday and we were denied alcohol on the patio because we were having too much of a good time. I've lived in Vegas for 10 years and have never been treated with so much disrespect.   Never ever going back to any Brio in Vegas EVER!  Food other than lobster bisque not worth it."}
{"text":"Chopped salad was great and so was the flatbread. Open tables outside but we still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. Atmosphere and service were good, I would recommend."}
{"text":"The Brio Steak Salad is one of my favorites. Absolutely delicious. Each time I order it, I enjoy every single bite.

Just wanted to add a picture."}
{"text":"Love the Happy Hour.  It would be great to have a couple more low carb options. My group loves the burger and shrimp dishes. I wish they would have converted my burger from buns to lettuce wrap, but it came out with just the meat patty on the plate. It would have been great to substitute the chips for vegetables.  Oh well, still yummy.   

Came again for the Brio Steak Salad. One of the Best in town."}
{"text":"Good and consistent service and food every time.

We usually order the bruschetta quattro ($14.95) for apps unless my little cutie pie decides on the Margharita Flatbread, then we get the Calamari Fritti ($10.95).  My fave is the Grilled Salmon salad ($14.95).  My hubby likes their Lasagna Bolognese ($17.65).  We like the house Chianti or Pinot Noir to go with our meals....or just water.  We may check this place out for their HH.

One of our girls night out go-to coffee and dessert too!  The servers are always very nice and accommodating. We've never felt like we're being rushed.  

The individual size servings of desserts are the main attraction for us:  creme brulee, cheesecake, pudding, tiramisu and milk chocolate cake...Oh my!   Five for $10.95, everyone is happy!

Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy!"}
{"text":"We were unhappy with one of the servers here and then moved to Abi's section. She was amazing and changed are whole night. Well be back to sit with abi again :)"}
{"text":"Arctic salmon  That's all I gotta say! The food there is great! Nice a fresh and always plated looking good. Unfortunately the service I had at the bar was straight up crap. He got our order after a little bit than didn't even make our cocktail until 25 mins after and poured two waters 15 mins after ordering. The food took a listle while to come out as well. He didn't ask or check up on us really at all until the very end of the meal whitch when i had the plates stacked in front of me. We would definitely come back and give it another shot maybe this time at a dining table."}
{"text":"The chicken under the brick is axing along with the eggplant and shrimp appetizer it's a must try"}
{"text":"I really don't get the high average of reviews here.  I think people are being blinded by the location. Sometimes a great ambience will make you feel the food tastes better than it does.  The ambience (decor and furniture) is top shelf.  BUT, the food here is really quite mediocre.  Just a step above a Sbarro's, with more flair.  I've received plates that were not to temperature (too cold), and inconsistently prepared (like the roasted, planked chicken I used to always go for, until I got the feeling that it just wasn't what it used to be.  The location at Town Square still does this dish fairly well).  The pasta is fairly good.  The salads are decent.  Other dishes are decent. The bread is quite good, and the only offering I've had so far that I don't feel I could make just as well, if not better, at home.  (When I go out to eat, I expect to partake of a meal that I could not do better at home!)  I think the menu is a bit too large, and they should do more rotation, and do more specials.  But this is not the reason for a 3-star review.  The real issue is the service.

The service is more miss than hit, in my experience here.  I have rarely felt that my server could care less about me and whomever I was eating with.  And because I work in the area (and professionals seem to gravitate to this place for lunch), I've had the experience of being here numerous times.  I've gotten out of it a few times, though, by suggesting other nearby spots!  (Like Vintner Grill).  I just have never felt especially welcomed or treated with warmth or enthusiasm here on any occasion whatsoever.  Even though I am quite a friendly person!  The girls up front are usually clueless, can't answer any questions about the menu, can't tell you if someone you're waiting for is there, make you feel as though you're bothering them if you sit and wait in the lounge chairs by the door for your party, wear the most ridiculously short skirts or dresses, or cleavage tops, and are snobby, and apparently catty.  Even the young guys give you \"I'm too sexy for this place\" vibes.  It's so not luxury.  And so at odds with the ambience of the environment.  I just don't GET why you would--out of all of the options at Tivoli Village (e.g., Echo & Rig)--pick this place."}
{"text":"Nice place with ample outdoor seating. Food was delicious but service was a bit slow. Waitress kept blaming it on happy hour. Overall a good experience and the pork chops are amazing"}
{"text":"Service is okay. We had reservations and were not seated for 30 minutes. Manager came to our table (16 in our party) and sincerely apologized. She sent us 6 appetizers. Nice recovery. Our server was good, not great. I had to ask twice for a refill, and he forgot my side of veggies. 

Quality of food is good. All hot and fresh. However, nothing special. Everyone in our party agreed food was good but not great.

Prices are too high. We don't mind paying high prices for great food, service, and experience. Brio did not quite make the grade."}
{"text":"Loved the food and ambiance. Only about $80 for a family of four w/wine, appetizers, entrees and dessert. Very reasonable. Will return next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"The crab crusted salmon special was fantastic. The portions were just right. The sourdough bread was an excellent compliment to our meal.  The atmosphere is very nice like an Italian courtyard. Will definitely come back here the next time we visit."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in town. I love love this location . The bartender Jade maybe Jayde I don't know but she is the bomb! Her attitude is always upbeat and her service is amazing . She bartend, cocktail and runs our food. Everything comes out amazing and she never forgets anything. The food quality and presentation puts the icing on the cake. Superb!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, upscale decor in Tivoli. Friendly but disjointed service. Our salads arrived but mine didn't.  Was pleasantly surprised by the Bistecca Insalata, crisp fresh greens with the right amount dressing when it finally arrived. My Veal Milanese was a big disappointment, tasted oily and reheated, the angel hair pasta was dry and the veg were either under cooked or dried out and wrinkled. The caper wine sauce was almost nonexistent. 
The other 5 in our party were satisfied and enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"I went to Brio for dinner today and I had the pork chop with veggies and it was pretty good. Although you might need to order 2 pork chops since the 1 did not fill me up completely. But everything was tasty especially the creme brulee for dessert."}
{"text":"Well I waited more than a month for a response from Brio's corporate before finally deciding to write this poor review. I really wanted to address this with Brio and not the rest of the world, but with no response whatsoever, here I go. I had brunch a month back, and ordered the eggs, home fries, and bacon. It says it comes with brioche toast on the menu. It does not. After addressing this with the waitress, the manager comes over. He stands there for a little while (very awkward) before finally asking what the issue was. Wasn't sure if he was waiting for me to say something first? Anyhow, he told me they don't have or have ever had brioche toast, and I asked him why the menu says they do? He says he doesn't print the menus and that corporate does. Wow!! I couldn't believe his answer! Maybe the correct answer should have been, \"You know you're right, it must be a misprint, I should let corporate know.\" It's very deceptive to advertise brioche toast to people and then serve crappy white stale toast. I rarely bring up anything I am displeased with at a restaurant, but this was Brio's third strike with me. The last time it was a cold omelette that I didn't say anything about. I wanted to give Brio another chance since I have been going here since the opening, (and their eggplant shrimp appetizer is actually pretty amazing), but three strikes and you're out."}
{"text":"One of my biggest pet peeves with restaurants is when they don't expedite properly.... within three minutes of each other, I received my bread and butter, my salad and then my dinner. What's absolutely ridiculous is that the server/bartender all have the same response \"Wow, that came out fast\" as if it's NEVER happened before.  So, there I was with three plates of food in front of me, not being able to enjoy any single one really. It's almost like they're forcing you to order one single item at a time. I can understand how this might happen when it's busy and they want to get patrons in and out as fast as they can... But, this was a Sunday late afternoon and they were maybe 1/3 full. I'm not in the restaurant industry, so I'm not sure if this is a bartender issue or kitchen issue. Either way, it ruined the visit for me and I won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Brio Tuscan Grill located in Town Square on South Las Vegas Blvd.  Brio is an Italian restaurant with an American flare and a trendy atmosphere.  Noise levels can be a little loud when it's really busy because of the open air design. The bar area is small but acomadating with full menu.  They also have a large outdoor seating area with umbrellas and patio heaters to help keep the temperature just right during your dining experience.  They have a good happy hour and morning Sunday all you can drink mirmosas.  Good food, great wine good times!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Menu is great for dinner but lacks around the lunch hour. Drinks are resonable and good. Order the calamari and the Caesar salad as a combo!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife to kill time while my kids played at the Gameworks right up the street for some small bites. We ordered the Bruschetta sampler which was good wish the steak was more tender. We also got the Brio chopped salad it was also good needed more veggies in my opinion but it was satisfactory. Now what I was most excited about was the prosciutto and Burrata pizza I wasn't disappointed it was good but after I got it immediately wanted the crust to be thinner maybe next time overall it turned out to be a nice time waster and the company was awesome. The staff are nice also they put us out of the way of the other people we also had our giant twin stroller so they do accommodate strollers even at lunch go figure."}
{"text":"Brio is one of my favorite restaurants in vegas my husband and I come here often however tonight I have some different feeling towards this place.   Our server seemed annoyed everytime we asked her for something,  we waited and waited for our apps to come out, one made it to the table one did not, everything took forever, our server disappeared for what seemed like hours,   very poor service tonight and I was not happy.  Get it together brio"}
{"text":"Good place for happy hour. I have gotten everything on the happy hour menu. It's always good. Brio burger is the best. Service is great and they have a very nice atmosphere. We will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"We love Brio.

I'm stuck ordering one thing always, Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccine.  I see other appetizing things, but can't not order the fettuccine as it's so wonderful."}
{"text":"4 of us went for a birthday celebration. Very attentive and food was good."}
{"text":"I go here regularly for their salmon salads and steak salads, so good!, never have any issues. I had a little situation last time with my food (my half empty lobster and shrimp bisque had no shrimp, and my steak salad came out with cold steak, half the salad drenched with sauce, the other half dry), and I asked our waiter (who was very nice and a good waiter) if he could get a manager over to us. Being a regular, I was curious if they had switched chefs or something since I was having so many issues. She saw my salad, apologized, and brought me back a new fresh one immediately (waiting there the whole time while it was being made). She also took care of our lobster bisque. Great food, and great customer service, gives then 5stars. Every restaurant has an off day here and there, but the way the situation was handled will keep me a regular at this place!"}
{"text":"Kai was awesome.  We were outside alone in the chill by the fire and he picked up our table.  Fabulous!!!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong at this place. I highly recommend the pasta brio. Also during the week if you can get here on time the happy hour is amazing!"}
{"text":"I like Brio. I have been there several times but the service in/at the bar is, simply put, TERRIBLE!! very disappointing !! bartenders are rude, clueless."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late dinner and decided to eat in the bar.  The bartender, Brendan, was great!  Service was fantastic!  He makes the best peach bellini EVER!   During the summer they have a reverse happy hour for the last hour of business.  We had the tomato mozzarella salad, a flatbread on the HH menu, and lamb chops and dessert ... way more than enough to eat, it was served quickly, and everything was great!  The chocolate lava cake is the best dessert they have, and although it came out under-heated the first time, it was corrected right away!  The manager, Vinnie, came by to make sure we were satisfied with everything.  That's customer service!  Always clean and nice decor too.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Cons: 1) in one of woman's cabin toilet didn't work light; 2) warmer outside didn't work eather; 3) tiramisu has too much cream; 4) there is a big line but outside and inside is plenty of free seats. 

Pros: 1) big and good food; 2) has a gluten free menu; 3) waitress is nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"A word of warning, this is not what most would consider authentic Italian, and I agree. It isn't. However, it's still tasty enough for me to enjoy and want to come back! Parking is a hassle since it's in the Town Center but just park in the lot about 3 blocks away and you're fine. Assuming you don't mind a bit of a walk in Vegas weather.

I had the Pasta Alla Vodka and it was tasty. It was ricotta filled with pieces of pancetta and a spicy tomato cream sauce. I do feel there could have been a bit more pancetta. The garlic was almost too absent to be considered a big contributor to the dish, which disappointed me because I'm a big garlic fan. 

They have some really interesting cocktails which unfortunately i wasn't able to sample since we were driving back after lunch. 

Decor is nice and dishes maybe be more than moderately priced. Came for lunch and it was about $16 plates. 

But I'll def be back"}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times throughout the past few years, but this is the first time I have decided to write a review. 

Now, normally when I see very fancy places located in popular areas, I tend to assume they are overpriced and over hyped. This restaurant, however; is an exception. While they are a on the pricier side, their food never disappoints. Everyone that I have ever been here with, myself included, finds the food to be well made and very flavorful with great consistency. 

Some of the crowd favorites for my friends and family are: Shrimp Mediterranean, Sliced Steak Salad (my personal favorite), Grilled Salmon Salad, Grilled Salmon Fresca (boyfriend's favorite), and Pasta Alla Vodka (best friend's favorite). Their warm chocolate cake is also divine, and they always serve focaccia and warm french bread as a starter. Although really, anything you order will be good. 

The only reason I docked a star is because we have had a few slow servers that weren't very attentive, and I highly recommend calling in a reservation on weekend nights. Things can get pretty busy and last time my boyfriend and I were here, our server was nice but very out of it. It's just a hit-or-miss in the service area.

Overall though, very nice place for meals and it lives up to its reputation of having fine Italian dining."}
{"text":"Went this evening for the first time actually as a fluke. Was waiting for a table at Postinos, but they had a wait there thay was a hour long. My friend and I were roaming around and stumbled upon Brio. We went in to just get a drink at the bar, but was greeted with such friendly service that we decided to just stay for dinner. Wednesday was $5.00 martini day in the bar area. Had 2 different ones that were great. A lemon drop and a peach one. The yummy basket of bread was a nice treat until our salads came. Great wedge salad. Got the vodka sauce pasta with ricotta, and it was so tasty. Cooked to perfection. What a nice restaurant to just stumble upon, but will be back again soon. yummo"}
{"text":"My husband and I recently got married in Las Vegas.  We live in Orange County, CA.  I called several restaurants to host our dinner for 50 people.  The management at Brio was more than helpful and made me feel comfortable and at ease at hosting the dinner.  We had never eaten at a Brio restaurant. Picking a place to eat from out of town is a little scary.  We were more than pleased.   They did an amazing job at securing our group in the back with a semi private area yet still part of the restaurant.  50 people sat comfortable.  We had our own table for two in the middle of our  group.  The tables were beautiful.  Everyone raved about the food and choices offered on our preset menus.  We had our own 3 servers and they did a spectacular job.  Thank you for completing our wedding day."}
{"text":"I love Brio! We come here all the time and are never disappointed. The happy hour is amazing, great options for food and drinks. The other night we had the brushetta Quattro, an all time favorite, minestrone soup, Caesar salad and tomato caprese. The bartenders are great, Larry and Brendan always take care of us. Chef Mike and the manager Kayla stopped by to see how everything was, definitely appreciated. Rarely does the manager AND chef stop by the table at other restaurants! The customer service is on point here and the food always exceeds expectations. I will be a Brio fan for life!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. The sourdough bread in the bread basket is outstanding!  I always get the lobster bisque, just so I can eat more bread. 

The chopped salad is my favorite!  Seems like it would be boring, but I love it. Lots of flavor!  The service can be pretty slow, but it's always very friendly. Since the restaurant is so busy, I kind of expect service to be slow. 

Originally, I was going to give them 4 stars. I bumped it to 5 because of how friendly and easy they were to work with. I had to deliver a wedding cake there. Many venues don't allow the cake to get there too early, but they let me deliver it early and they carefully stored it and presented it to the client.  It was 3 tiers. Outstanding business to business service!"}
{"text":"Their light menu is fabulous. I had the salmon Fresca and the flavors were so delicious, especially the sweet potatoes and balsamic glaze. Loved the healthy options. Outdoor seating on a nice night is also great! Also recommend the peach sangria, sweet and refreshing."}
{"text":"Great service, outstanding flavors, variety, and huge wine selection!
You can stay as long as you like, there's never a rush to leave!
I love the patio when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"Great decor and very good food!  Service was very mediocre this past visit although the manager saved with a complimentary bisque.  The group we hosted loved the restaurant."}
{"text":"My review is for the Happy Hour. This place is packed for happy hour basically every day. Recently, my wife and I were lucky enough to score a table on the patio. The restaurant, bar and patio are beautiful. The patio has plenty of umbrellas to keep the sun out of the eyes while you sip on some cold beverages. The service was courteous and prompt. I actually felt like a guest.

They have raised the prices on the happy hour bites from $3 to $4. We ordered a Brio Burger with cheese which was cut into fourths and it was huge. Not a bad tasting burger. The Picante Shrimp was excellent as well. The sausage and pepperoni flat bread was just ok for me. But last time, we only spent about 12 bucks for food plus whatever the drinks cost. And of course taxes and tip.

This is a great chill place with a lot of ambiance to hang out with friends for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"I ordered Pesto chicken pasta! What a rip of!!!! When it came, I asked where is the pesto. I was told that it was a light broth. Wish someone had told me I was ordering a bowl of cooked pasta-ugh!"}
{"text":"OOOOHHhh My GOOODdNesSSSSs!!! The moment you walk through the doors.. you just know this place is a winner. I am writing this review with a smile on my face because if you have ever tried Brio... you know why. First and foremost, the restaurant is beautifully constructed inside and out. HUGE outside patio with fireplaces and inside you'll find a very open area with high ceilings, flat screens, large booths, and busy friendly servers. I ordered the mushroom stuffed ravioli with brown butter (holy mother.. absolutely to die for!!!) appetizer, lobster bisque (creamy.. just the right consistency and flavor with lobster pieces on top served in a cute white porcelain bowl) and the Sausage Gnocchi (perfect with red bell peppers, browned red onions in creamy red bell pepper sauce.. just a hint of spice). I cannot believe there isn't a Brio here in So Cal!!! The menu is very simple: brunch, soups, salads, pizza, pasta, and bruschetta (perfect portions). I am so sure whatever you go with, you will not be disappointed. I plan on taking everyone I love, here for a scrumptious toothsome Italian meal! BEL CIBO!!!"}
{"text":"If I'm craving Italian, I go for Brio. Every time. Their Tuscan Harvest salad is the perfect blend of savory and sweet with the most amazing homemade dressing. Their pasta alla vodka is the most delicate pasta filled with the creamiest ricotta, and smothered in the best vodka sauce you will ever have."}
{"text":"Kept hearing good things about the happy hour here so we finally stopped in. And WOW, can't believe it took us so long to check it out - it's now one of my new fave places. The happy hour is INCREDIBLE! For $3 you get some amazing food, got 2 apps and it was more than enough as a meal. 

The 2 apps I had were the shrimp/eggplant which was so MOUTH-WATERING-DELICIOUS-I-WANT-SOME-RIGHT-NOW good, and also the margherita flatbread (also tasty). 

Hubby had the Brio burger and it was HUGE. 

The drinks were not on happy hour (boo) but I was happy to pay the $8 for the pomegranate martinis because they were delish! 

We loved the place so much we took advantage of their gift card special, buy $100 and get a $20 card free.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went here after i got married. We had 19 in our party and the servers were wonderful. All of us were really impressed. We even had a private room. Its a little expensive, but worth the extra dollars. My steak w/mashed potatoes and roasted veggies was around $30. The atmosphere is nice, its very laid back.  Thank god for the private room, we were able to stash away my very loud family of comedians!"}
{"text":"Had a really nice lunch with a friend on the patio. All of the hostesses and our waitress were all very accommodating and friendly. I wasn't expecting them to be very friendly after reading some of the reviews but we actually received excellent service. We split the Quinoa Salad with Asparagus and Grilled Chicken. It was very good, filled with flavor and was just right for a light lunch."}
{"text":"I had the lobster bisque soup and carbonara pasta and it was very good! I came during lunch and it was not too busy.  The service was good, although I had to ask for a spoon for my soup.  Also they had a kids menu with activities but no crayons or pencils.  My experience was good overall and I am giving four stars simply because it was not a WOW experience.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very professional service and food. I came for the cool location. Outdoors can actually get noisy so if you dont like it too loud, avoid."}
{"text":"I've been to Brio twice. The first time I had a decent Caesar salad. It wasn't anything special but I know experience wise, Brio is one of the best and most popular places in Town Square. It's been more than a year until I heard about the happy hour. Their bar happy hour features $5 drinks and $3.99 items. I went with the chips and burger and for that price you can't go wrong!  They also have shrip, ravioli and another 5 or so items on the happy hour menu starting at 9PM. Ill definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Underwhelming.  Food was just ok.  Maybe because we had a group of 10, but we were there on a Sunday and hardly anyone was there.  Food was cold and service was just ok. They hardly refilled our drinks and never offered dessert.  This used to be one of our favorites."}
{"text":"Excellent menu! Friendly staff and great environment. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Been going to Brio for over 6 years here and in NJ. Tonights service during happy hour at the bar with Phillip as our server was the worst EVER. We tip VERY WELL having worked in the industry. This is the second time we have had Phillip as our bartender, the next time we arrive and see him at the bar we will move onto California Pizza Kitchen or Claim Jumpers.

We have had both Jade and Roselle as our servers at the bar and they are both EXCELLENT. Phillip needs to take a few lessons from their playbook!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Delicious food, elegant atmosphere, good service.

Cons: Out of the last 4 times I have been here, I have found hair in my food 3 times. Gross. Lost my appetite entirely."}
{"text":"Ummm... Five stars for Brio's happy hour, am I taking crazy pills?!

It feels odd, but I must have hit this place at the right time because the service was incredibly fast, the food was beyond expectations, and the price was stellar, $3.95 for a Margherita flatbread pizza? I'm in!

I came here after working an event, just looking for a quick snack before hitting the long road back to Henderson. I bellied up to the bar and almost fell off my chair when I peeked at the menu saw the prices; the most expensive item was the Brio Burger for $6. I didn't order this, but instead went with Black Pepper Shrimp, Beef Carpaccio, Tuscan Tots and a Margherita Flatbread. 

Everything was very good, but the Black Pepper Shrimp was the winner of the meal. Seared Romano crusted eggplant with seared shrimp on top and some insane cream sauce, definitely not a low calorie option, but worth totally worth it. The beef Carpaccio is must order, it wasn't too fatty and cut paper thin it will literally melt in your mouth. 

The Tuscan Tots were sneaky. I was thinking these would be your basic tater tots, but they are small mashed potato balls that are coated in breadcrumbs and filled with bacon, mozzarella cheese and fried, I'm done. The Flatbread pizza was great, covered in fresh veggies and flavorful basil, but compared to everything else it was probably least favorite out of the bunch, but still worth ordering.  

The price point was the best part of the whole meal, with two cocktails each and with all the food mentioned prior, our tab didn't break $40. 

Happy Hour goes from 3:30 - 6:30pm and then again from 8pm to close. Great atmosphere, no smoking and great food.... duh, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We have been to Brio at least a dozen times and after this last visit we will not be returning.  We had family in from out of town and we were telling them how great this place was....Well we are so embarrassed that we took them here.  The service was so terrible and the food was not much better.  We had a table of five, and it did not seem to be a very busy evening.  Every meal came except for one and we were told it would be right out.  Ten minutes later we asked about the meal and we were told that the kitchen made it wrong again...What?  We were not even told it was wrong once, only that it would arrive in a few minutes.  We decided to cancel the meal since everyone was waiting to start their dinner so that one person would not be eating alone. The waitress said \"let me get the manager\".  He came over and was a complete ass.  He said \"what seems to be the problem?\" So we told him our issue and his reply was \" we are making it on the fly\".  Well if he knew what the problem was why did he ask? And then when it came to the bill the waitress said \"I wish you would have ordered dessert, it was on the house\".  Nice to know it, after the fact!  Just a colossal mess.  Everyone makes mistakes, just let us know...Don't leave us hanging."}
{"text":"I ordered scallops on risotto because they had advertised it although I never saw the price. Shrimp risotto was $16 so I wasn't too worried. The scallops were burned black on both sides. I kept waiting for it to improve. It was like a charcoal sandwich with tasteless scallops in between.  The risotto tasted like a can of sauce was dumped on it.  I hated it but kept eating because I was so hungry.  I should have said something right away. When I got the check and saw that the scallops were $25, I felt I had been scammed.  I didn't want money back, just an answer. The waiter didn't help.  I will never go back..not happy hour or anything.   Brio chef's cooking stinks and they serve it anyway. Yuck."}
{"text":"The go to place for entertaining guests. great for a meal with family and friends. The open space is very welcoming with tasteful furnishing. Far above-average fare for a chain, you get your money's worth in both food and atmosphere combined with wonderful service. The place fits well in the Town Square environment."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian spots in Henderson.  The food and ambience is amazing"}
{"text":"Just wow, Brio, you blew my socks off!

Spinach and Artichoke Dip:
- Has a hearty, cheesy flavor
- Great for veggie-haters too, you can barely taste then
- Perfect chip-to-dip ratio
- enough for six adults

Gerber All-Natural Lemon Pepper Chicken:
- beautiful presentation
- not sure how to describe the vegetables, but the way they prepared it is a mix between fresh off the grill and also steamed (??). My point, veggies were delish!
- the skin in the chicken was crisp and crunchy 
- the meat on the chicken was moist, I didn't even need a knife
- not a huge mashed-potato fan but it's mixed with 'mystery' seasoning that revolutionized my thoughts on mashed-potatos

Our server was genuine and knowledgeable. I just can't give that fifth star because of the hostess though.. It was dinner time when we came in (6 adults and 2 kids) and she told us it was about an hour wait. Understandable. We were all tired and weren't about to walk to another restaurant though. Noticing a few empty booths, we asked to be seated there but she promptly told us it's only for parties of 6. They looked pretty spacious and the two kids are no more than 4. We said we didn't mind cramping together and she told us, 'She would need to ask because they don't set the tables for 8.' She seemed extremely annoyed at our request as if placing two more plates was such a huge hassle -.-

Good customer service is a big deal to me. Brio's got their food DOWN PAT, they just need to work on service and they'll be awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here for a very late lunch and got a table easily. It's such a gorgeous space with high ceilings and very old Tuscany look and feel. My boyfriend and I ordered a bunch of plates to share: Bruschetta, Flat bread, and crab and artichoke dip. The bruschetta had balsamic vinegar drizzled on top which I did not like. I don like balsamic vinegar and wish it said that on the menu :( The crab and artichoke dip was my favorite dish, mhmmm so creamy and had huge chunks of crab! The flat bread was yummy but I was so full at that point I couldn't have too much. The portions are HUGE and we were so stuffed after, so much for a light lunch. The orange juice however is not fresh squeezed lol I saw them pour it out of a huge generic brand bottle.

P.S. bathrooms are very pretty. I love me a pretty bathroom."}
{"text":"Love coming here!  Jeffrey, Mandy and Wendy are awesome bartenders! Always service with a smile! Wish I could come by more often! One of my favorite dishes is the black pepper shrimp with eggplant!"}
{"text":"It is what it is. A very pretty chain Italian restaurant. If you are looking for authentic or out of the box original, don't go here. If you are looking for solid, safe Italian American fare, this is your place. There was nothing wrong but nothing outstanding either, oh, except the butter, it was awesome. And to Jason B., all the shrimp that we get in Arizona is frozen. All of it!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed lunches here and decided to take my Aunt and Uncle for a special dinner. The ambience is beautiful, the server was cheerful and seemed attentive.

What was disappointing was the cold food. Everyone in the party had cold food, except for my pasta meal. My Aunt's grilled chicken was very dry and seemed over cooked and cold. how does that happen. Was it the server? Was it the cook? 

The Alfredo fettuccini was a side dish and we know why. It tastes like an Applebee's sauce. It's good, but not enough Parmesan cheese flavor. Worse...it was cold. 

My favorite part of the meal was the sourdough bread, special crackers, and butter served while waiting.

I guess we will stick to lunches. The lobster bisque is amazing."}
{"text":"Go to happy hour!! Cheap and very, very good. And the appetizers arrive FAST. You have to sit in the bar to get happy hour prices, but it's worth it. The place is fairly upscale and the restaurant is expensive. The bar packs fast, so go early. Happy hour lasts until 6:30."}
{"text":"$2.95 appetizers during Happy Hour

Great deal because the apps are d-lish!

My table ordered almost everything on the Happy Hour menu and we were thrilled with everything.  The shrimp-tini was light and tasty.  The mozzarella and roasted red peppers bruschettta was not light... but it certainly was tasty.  

You can easily make a whole meal out of the Happy Hour menu for less than $10.

The downside... HH ends at 6:30pm."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of the chain restaurants but this one I love. The ambiance is chill and the food and drinks are consistent. 

We sat on the patio and it was a beautiful night to do so. Enjoyed some drinks, appetizers, desserts and coffee. One of my favorite go to dish here is the Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant appetizer. It's all about that sauce. This dish never disappoints and I usually always get this when I visit Brio. No, seriously!!! A few other favorites I have had before (but not on this particular visit) include Beef Carpaccio, Lobster Bisque, Bistecca Insalata, Roasted Whole Chicken. 

On this visit, we had the Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant, Bruschetta Sampler, Pasta Alla Vodka, Torta di Cioccata, and Creme Brûlée. Everything was good! Our server Jason was very good. Friendly, informative and attentive. We'll be back!

I also had a Cucumber Basil Gimlet which may be one of my new favorite cocktails. Hendrick's Gin, fresh basil, crushed cucumber, Angostura bitters, fresh lemon and lime, on the rocks. Refreshing and light drink."}
{"text":"Brio has one of the best happy hours in town. Awesome spicy shrimp, chicken nachos and tomato mozzarella salad. Great food and all great big portions even for happy hour."}
{"text":"Food & service was okay.  Maybe it was the time of day, but I counted 15+ employees just standing around by the kitchen area. No kidding! Probably wont't eat there again."}
{"text":"This was a top notch dining experience. The food and service was excellent. A tad on the pricey side but worth it for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Been going to Brio for several years now, used to frequent the Town Square location but recently started going to the Tivoli one more often. I have to say, this location is great! It's an open kitchen and you can see pretty much what happens in there. The chefs, cooks, & servers seem to have a great dynamic -- service is great and food gets out quick.  

I've had most things on the menu, but I'm very partial to the Double Cut Porkchop with Gorgonzola crust. Amazing! Also, the cauliflower side is my favorite. 

Don't sleep on the Mascarpone Cheesecake as well for dessert. 10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"My first time there this meal was one of the worst I have had in a long time my wife ordered a rib eye medium it came out dry over cooked sent it back then it came out ok but for $32 it was not high quality I ordered shrimp and lobster linguine the shrimp did not taste good seemed like they were very poor quality the manager offered a free dessert which I choose the cheesecake to take home so i just tried that wow horrible so I decided to leave this review $75 dollars later so many other places better could have went to Flemings for $20 more or Cheesecake Factory for less"}
{"text":"I want to love this place, but I just don't.
Everytime I eat here, I wish I were eating at Olive Garden....
For a chain, I just don't have any memorable items that I'd come back for (as opposed to Olive Garden's crack like breadsticks)

Meh"}
{"text":"solid food, great salads, good service.  comfortable and pleasant setting.. good bang for the buck.  what else do you want?  hot sourdough bread?  they have that too..  super nom nom.     the summerlin location is def mellower than the Town Square location."}
{"text":"Wow - this place has gone downhill quickly.  My son came into town, and we picked him up at his hotel on the Strip, and drove the whole way out here because I had bragged on how good it was.  Well,needless to say, the service was terrible.  The food was mediocre.  We were overcharged ($15) on the bill - and we will NOT be back.  The bill was over $100 for 3 people, and the Pasta Brio which is usually quite good was dry, unflavorful, and very disappointing.  My son also ordered the Brio Pasta, based on my previous recommendation, and he did not even finish the dish.  We had to ask fro butter and bread three different times, and never received it. 
Also, if you are desirous of traditional Bruschetta, do NOT order the Bruschetta Quattro - it is bruschettas with red peppers all over them.  YUK!!  When I order Bruschetta,I want chopped tomatoes, cheese,cilantro and italian seasonings on toasted bread.  

I was embarrassed to have bragged about this restaurant that I have been to MANY times in the past.  However, I would not recommend it to anyone now.  I know my son was disappointed....and it made me sad because I wanted to enjoy a wonderful evening with him.  Shame on Brio for their decline.  We will NOT recommend or be back.  RIP OFF!"}
{"text":"We love Brio!  They have the BEST steak around bar none!  And the creme brûlée is phenomenal too.

We have always had great service as well.   

If we could only get in for happy hour it would  be perfect."}
{"text":"I love the food here.  It's fun, it's carbs, and it's yummy.  If you're looking for some good food in Town Square that isn't the typical stops, try this place.  Great decor, great service and a tasty menu."}
{"text":"This place is not worth the money! Went there lastnight and had crab stuffed fish with veggies and my girlfriend ordered the Lobster-shrimp stuffed Ravioli. She said it was the worst lobster stuffed ravioli she has ever had and its one of her favorite foods. So i tried a bite of her food and she was right, it was almost tasteless. My crab stuffed fish was good but, the potatoes that came with it were burnt! Like really really brunt, like almost black. All the veggies were over seasoned to the point that i didn't eat them. And i'm not one to complain, i like a lot of seasoning and i love veggies. 

Over all both our dinners were boarder line terrible. Oh and when they brought our food out they made her the wrong thing. So on top of the food quality being very bad they screwed up the order. They did give her a free desert for screwing up the order so that was cool of them. Nice atmosphere...not very good, overpriced food."}
{"text":"Salmon was great  
Service excellent 
Local beer, ill try again 
This guys never disappoint, this is the care that you get in a family owned restaurant with the highest everything"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in Las Vegas! And if you don't agree, please message me and let me know which place has a better happy hour! This review is for their happy hour only since we didn't look at their regular menu. Happy hour is from 3:30-6:30 and I believe they have a late night happy hour as well but I could be wrong... so call and double check. 

If you park in the structure near Staples, you can walk through Inglots to Brio. I wasn't expecting such a fancy place but it was! Bar is self seating and they had some couches and benches on one side, and a covered patio on the outside along with a wrap around bar. Service was a bit slow in terms of getting drinks out but our server, Danielle was sweet and checked on us often. 

Brio's sangrias are on the sweet side, but they are definitely tasty! I ordered the white peach sangrias while my gfs ordered the sangria rosa. The white peach sangria was a bit sweeter than the sangria rosa. Brio also offers $5 martini wednesdays and $5 wine thursdays! The martinis that they offer include the classics but also some interesting specialty ones as well. I'll have to come back on a Wednesday to check it out!

We ordered 3 beef carpaccio (yes, it was THAT good). I wasn't too fond of the parmesan flatbread... which was more of like a chip to me. The field greens salad was lightly tossed with a dressing which worked very well with the beef carpaccio. 

2/5 Sausage and pepperoni flatbread: the flatbread was a bit TOO crispy IMO. I think they might have slightly overbaked it. There wasn't enough ricotta on there, but the pieces that did have ricotta were delicious. 

3/5: Brio burger: the brio burger is one burger, cut into 4 pieces with their homemade chips on top. I didn't care much for the chips and neither did my friends. I thought it was too salty. We ordered the burger to be cooked medium, but it came out to be medium well, which wasn't a big deal. The meat was juicy and the bun reminded me of a hawaiian roll. 

4/5: Black peppered shrimp: My friends LOVED the sauce that came with this dish. I thought it was a bit spicy (just a kick) but enjoyed the eggplant. There were about 9 pieces of shrimp in the dish. The shrimp was small, but nicely presented and for the price, it wasn't too bad. My friends ended up dipping the burger into the left over sauce. 

We were all stuffed at the end of our meal and the bill for everything, including 2 white peach sangrias and 5 sangria rosas was about $70. Not bad at all! Brio is our new happy hour spot and we can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Wanted to give Brio another try with my family joining me Thursday evening for dinner and drinks. The first time we went the food was very good, but the service was terrible at best. Had to ask for everything from utensils, napkins, water numerous times, and they forgot part of our order and still charged us for it. This all occurred in the bar area on a weekend so we decided to give it a try in the dining room on a weekday. Totally different experience... the food was very good and the service was excellent. Glad we gave Brio's another shot.... we will just avoid the bar area and go to their dining area during the week!!!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed... not what it used to be. Seemed very much like Macaroni Grill. Plus the men's room was filthy. They must've run out of paper towels, so the threw a package of paper napkins in the towel holder.  Plastic still around the napkins. Brussel sprouts were virtually raw.. green beans way too saltly. Pasta over cooked. Steak prepared raw, when i asked for medium. Cockroaches outside (i know, but still a big turn off when you know they're walking around by your feet and the sandaled feet of lived ones). This is the second time there in 2 months where the experience was subpar. Bloody Mary's are better on airplanes. Bartenders act like they are doing you a favor by serving you a lousy drink."}
{"text":"We have gone here twice now and love it!!  It is a HUGE restaurant so you probably won't have to wait for a table.  It is just beautiful! High ceilings and big booths. I love the décor. it makes you feel like you are in Italy!

The staff is always great and dressed very professionally.

We got the warm bread to start, then spinach artichoke dip which was great!!

For meals, I got a salad and it was huge!! Enough to take home for a second meal.  My boyfriend got a pasta dish and he loved his as well.

We went back a second time when we had family in town and they were all pleased with their meals as well. So overall, it is a great experience!"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in Vegas. Food and drinks were great and the service at the bar was no different."}
{"text":"Great happy hour if you can get a seat. Come early, but don't expect a spot if you show up after 530PM. Decent entree's, but overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"I once went to Brio and we had such a good food. After that first outing I would give them 5 stars. Then I went with friends twice on a different occasion and I was somewhat disappointed with my steak both times. Well done steak does not mean burned steak. Also, it did not have any flavor.  I had to ask for a steak sauce.  Jumbo shrimp was medium size and a little too garlicky for my friend's taste. 
Calamari appetizer was crispy and not chewy so I would give it 4 stars.  Sauces and wild rice - very good.  Bread also nice and fresh.  Pleasant atmosphere outside on a patio and good service."}
{"text":"Two friends and I just got back from Brio at Town Square.   This was one of the better Italian meals I've had in a long time.   

The atmosphere is comfortable, nice bar area, outdoor patio seating makes this a very nice place for dinner.

One friend had the Lobster Ravioli and we both thought they were excellent, She didn't leave one bit.  Darn it!   (We always taste each others dinner.)

The other friend had the Mediterranean Penne, she loved it.  I thought it was pretty good.

I had the Chicken Limone which I love as Chicken Piccata when I make it at home.  This one was awesome.  Two large, very tender chicken breasts in a creamy butter/lemon sauce.   Sides of crispy potatoes and roasted veggis made this a truly wonderful choice.

The Caesar salad we ordered, (mine with very good anchovies) were a little on the dry side but very good flavor.  The romaine lettuce very fresh.

My Cosmopolitan  was perfect as was the others' Fruitini.  A fruit flavored martini.  

Service was good, except our waitrees forgot to bring me extra lemon for my chicken.   Not a big deal.  The place was full - unusual for a Tuesday evening and she was very busy. 


Valet parking is available if you can't find a spot on the street.  This is one we will definitely return to soon."}
{"text":"I went here the other night for my wife's birthday with 10 people total and the general consensus was that the pasta dishes weren't good.  I split my wife's pasta dish, shrimp and pasta and the pasta wasn't cooked correctly and the sauce tasted bad.  Other pasta dishes at the table tasted the same since we shared dishes.

The service wasn't great either, and we had 2 servers.  The food took forever and one of our friends didn't get her food until well after we did, which is never good.

We tried this place because it looked good and for the location, but there's plenty of other places I'd try before ever going back here based on the service and quality of food."}
{"text":"Italian Moscow Mule is amazing here, so is the lobster bisque and. Everything else on the menu. Definitely a must if in Town Square"}
{"text":"First time in this new location.

Meh.

Looks like they've fizzled out. Noting special. Nothing really good."}
{"text":"Walking into Brio is like walking into some kind of palace. 
Its highly ornate decor, combined with the well dressed staff make me feel like royalty.

Princely, I order, with a quick hand gesture shooing my waiter when finished. I'm in full character now. 
All further communication with my server will be hand gestures, either kissing the fingers on one hand to signal bravo, or the back of my palm in a waving, dismissive manner.

I do neither.
Instead, I enter into a vegetative state, still in shock from seeing the shallow little bowl of Pasta E Fagioli they just served up. 
Then I taste it. 
That's when I wish they would have assigned me a royal taste tester to make certain an unruly chef wasn't trying to poison his magnate. 

I get through the soup, but I'm still unable to speak for fear the next thing out of my mouth will be \"Off with his head!\"

I've learned the hard way it's not pc to invoke the term 'head' when on a date, and in such palatial surroundings."}
{"text":"I hosted my sister's bridal shower here and they were absolutely fantastic to work with especially considering I am located in Los Angeles and not familiar with the area, they were very considerate of working with me in order to make this a fantastic day for my sis.

They have two private rooms for private parties that are very nice and elegant.  Since our group was smaller in size, we opted for the public outdoor patio which was very nice.  They also let us bring in our own desserts to celebrate her.

Our food was great which included an aritchoke dip appetizer and then I had their Citrus Green Salad which was really flavorful.

The service was excellent.  Crystal was our catering coordinator who was great to work with leading up to the event.  Michael, the manager, was also super friendly.  Our day-of server (I can't remember his name sadly) was also great to us and very patient allowing us to occupy the table for a long time.  

Would definitely go back there the next time I am in the Vegas/Henderson area."}
{"text":"When the stars make you drool
just like a pasta fazool, that's amore!..


try their pork chops, freakin awesome!"}
{"text":"Big fan of this restaurant! First time at this location and it won't be my last. We started with the Roasted Garlic, Spinach, and Artichoke Dip with a Parmesan Flat Bread. One of the best I've had; the ones I usually get are too salty and lacking in flavor, but this one was perfect.

As an entree I got the Pasta Pesto, my father got the Pasta Brio (his go to), and our friends got the Ravioli di Bello, and Balsamic Braised Beef Short Rib. 

The Pasta Pesto was amazing. Didn't want too hardy of a sauce and too much food so this dish was perfect. It had a light sauce (since usually pasta dishes have too much). The Pasta Brio...there is no wrong with this dish! Again, not an overwhelming sauce, portion is bigger than the Pasta Pesto, but perfect for eating it the next day. I can't vouch for the Short Rib and Ravioli, but I know our friends enjoyed it VERY much. 

Our waiter was great. He made the experience even better. Great recommendations, very personable, made us feel very welcomed. Also, it was my Aunt's birthday 2 days prior and we mentioned it casually and he ended up bringing a small dessert for her without us even asking. Haven't had service like this for a while."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Its a very fancy place but casual at the same time. Food was amazing. My steak was cooked perfect and my sangria was deeeelish! Cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"very nice looking restaurant.  I was going to order the full size chicken lemoine.  we went with the light menu having had a late lunch. Big mistake.  While the full size dinners looked  large.  I was very disappointed! Three in our party  One person had the penne pasta.  nice bowl and i had a taste nice.   one other person in our party and i ordered the light chicken lemon.  I thought instead of  two chicken breasts i would get one. Well it looked like The Kitchen gave the other person 3/4 and I got a piece of chicken  2 inches by  2.5 inches.  Most likely carved from my parties chicken breast.  I was a guest and kept myself silent.  To serve me such a small portion of chicken that  had four corners as it  most likely was carved out of my parties breast.  For 12.95   such an embarassment to Brio.   Short cuts in the kitchen.  No supervision ? And here we were planning to return  Sunday with our family and most likely full plates.  Bad move Brio.  Your kitchen ruined my dinner and Your reputation.  Sorry .  you got one star , the warm bread was nice and my veggies were  just ok.   To short  someone on the  ontray.......   poor kitchen supervision.....   I'm afraid to return!   our waitress was very  good.  Needless to say if wasn't with who i was with i would've screamed."}
{"text":"The Brio  (location #2 west of the strip), is a new favorite stop when we come to Las Vegas. Service was outstanding, our wait staff highly informed and knowledgeable about all the menu items. We were there with a group of 10 and the service didn't suffer at all.  I couldn't recommend this restaurant higher.  Can't wait for my next visit..."}
{"text":"I tried this place after hearing good things from my father, and can honestly say that I am glad he recommended it. I didn't have the full service,I just sat at a table near the bar and ordered some of the great happy hour specials they offered.  I had a mojito,mango with rum and some mint, which was very fresh and well made the bartenders are very professional looking (one even had the old time mustache). The appetizers range from $4-$6, and there are good ones at all three prices. The Margherita flatbread is an amazing tasting tuscan pizza like creation with great ripe tomato slices, and fresh cheese and basil,it was light and enjoyable.  We tried to order the spinach artichoke dip but we were talked out of it by our server who recommended something else (besides the ravioli) so we ordered the shrimp, which came with a great flavored sauce (a bit peppery) and served over a delicious fried eggplant which gives it great texture and another amazing flavor. We also had a small salad that came with a big slice of prosciutto and some greens with a fantastic vinaigrette dressing which I would recommend you try on any of their salads. The overall presentation of the place is great,it's in the Scottsdale Quarter so it's tucked away. Inside its amazing,large shelves encase some fantastic pieces of italian cookware in a rustic manner, and the temple style ceiling that raises to a point in the center of the floor is amazing as well. I would like to try the regular menu,it's quite expensive but I'm sure it's worth it,and the service will make it all worth while for you,I highly recommend you drop by for appetizers at least, they are great priced and well worth it."}
{"text":"We came here 1/1/09 right after viewing a traditional New Year's Day movie next door @ Rave Movie Theatre.  Since it was 10pm, it wasn't crowded at all.  I picked up a card right at  the entrance to the restaurant for a free appetizer with purchase of an entree (score!).  We ordered the fabulous mussels (usu $11.50) that came in a bacon cream sauce.  The entrees were delish but my dining partner didn't like the lasagne due to the fact that it did come in a cream sauce but I thought it was great because it wasn't thick & lasagne noodle-y.  My veal milanese classico was tasty & is lemony with (in a good way).  Our waiter, Allen, was fine, not weird as was mentioned in previous reviews but forgot to fill our water & ice tea.  Pretty decor, plentiful food, had a lot of leftovers for the next day so all in all would definitely return but I'll also ask my Italian colleague what she thinks"}
{"text":"Seriously Taylor, worst customer service ever! Not only was I on hold for 10 minutes, you passed me around 6 times and had everyone tell me to hold. Then they say your in training, so be honest if you don't know what your talking about."}
{"text":"I left 4 star reviews previously, decided to come back to this place. Being at the restaurant for the third time, I am convinced that Brio became one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Have been a regular for years and the food keeps you coming back. It is also one of the best happy hours in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We showed up with two cranky hangry toddlers and were blown away by the service Tony and staff provided on a Friday night. When I say blown away, I REALLY mean it y'all. The coloring tablecloth and play dough brilliantly kept our toddlers busy and happy. Happy kids equals happy parents that got to enjoy their drinks and yummy dinner in peace. Thank you Brio, we shall return!"}
{"text":"The name is more marketing than a showcase of authentic Tuscan cuisine but the menu is full of items that are tasty to the American palate. Attentive service, serviceable ambiance,  and a menu that probably has 20 dishes I'd like to try.  They also have a great \"light\" menu for those of us paying 'lip service' to diets."}
{"text":"My golfing buddies and I were starving when we arrived.  The waitress was bright and cheery.  We ordered the calamari appetizer and surveyed the wine list.  We ordered the wine and our entrees.   The waitress returned with our wine.  She said the calamari was coming and left.  Then, the servers brought our entrees.  Still no appetizer.  The waitress apologized and offered to get it, but we told her not to.  I had the Pasta Brio--excellent.  More than I could eat.  The other guys were very pleased with their meals as well.  We finished our meals and received the check.  We were charged for the appetizer.  

Summary:  Nice decor.  Good dining atmosphere.  Cheery but poor service.  Very good food.  I've eaten at Brio a number of times (in Birmingham) and have never been disappointed.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Amazing! Located at town square on LVB. 

I've only had them for delivery but still was happy most of the time. Few times was delivered late (not the restaurants fault and that was addressed)but was still good luke warm. 

I don't care for lobster that much but love the lobster bisque! 
Loved several of the pastas. 
Chicken meal and others all impressive and flavorful. 

Give them a try! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What can I say, the ambiance when you walk in looks like a nicer, more upper class version of Cheesecake factory. It has high ceilings, drapes, expo kitchen... everything you'd want in an Italian-american spot.

The wait staff seemed kind but a bit \"above the rest\"... if you know what I mean. Just because the location is in Scottsdale doesn't mean you need to act out the assumed local attitude.

In the food department, the food looked beautiful. Plated for a photo opp, so that was nicely done. As for flavor, it doesn't stand out to me as a place that is AMAZING... it is more of a 'good' place to eat. I would definitely not drive out of my way for this restaurant. But if I'm again in the area and craving this type of cuisine, I'll most likely stop in"}
{"text":"I love this place when I'm in the mood for back home Italian. I have to say, I've been here a handful of times and have only ever sat in the bar area and had apps (I'm a creature of habit!).
The Italian Wedding Soup is some of the best I've ever had (seems to be served most Saturdays) - it's what draws me here.
My PIC says the lobster bisque is just as good.
The calamari is delicious, and is compete with banana peppers!! Finally, Vegas!!
The bruchetta and flatbreads are also delicious; my favorite is the sundried tomato or the margarita.
My only complaint: the wedding soup is a soup de jour, but should totally be available everyday."}
{"text":"I work at Scottsdale Quarter and this little gem never disappoints! I always receive Outstanding Service! I'm constantly stopping in for my quick lunches which they accommodate by being quick with my order! Also, several peers I work with enjoy meeting up for drinks or a snack on the patio!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my mother late night and was surprised to see that it was quite readily available and busy enough to enjoy on a weekday. 
Loved my wait staff: chef accidentally placed chicken in my salad, and my waiter caught it just as it hit my table. Super awesome. 
Ambiance: beautiful outdoor patio with mist so you don't get too hot. Trendy/casual vibe. The tables are really big and round so it's nice for conversations and food sharing with groups. 
Food: got the pesto pasta with salmon. Super good! Love how you can make your own pasta. Just wish there were a few more flatbread options."}
{"text":"I have to say the whole reason I give this restaurant 5 stars is because of our server Adrian- he was so personable and friendly!! He catered to our large party and was very consistent with his service, I really appreciate a restaurant that hires someone like him who truly cares about our experience. I will be back thanks to him!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Heaven. Bríos happy hour is wonderful but be prepared to wait a while. It's always packed because it's always good. I came here with some friends and we ordered the red sangria which I thought was delicious but my friends said it was too bitter. I think to each their own. They preferred the white sangria. 
We started off with the tomato and mozzarella salad, the beef carpaccio and the black pepper shrimp! Everything was delicious of all three my favorite was the shrimp. 
Next we ordered the dessert trio and a dessert. I have no idea what we were thinking, I guess we were hungry at this point the alcohol had set in and our server convinced us. The trio had mascarpone,creme brûlée,and a strawberry short cake mason jar. We also ordered the brownie sundae. Delicious! My favorite was the mascarpone. All together our check was less than 50. What a steal. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Brio is a good chain italian food restaurant. Food is consistent, service is good and has nice environment. It is not the same as going to your neighborhood italian spot but does a nice job.

Brio is always willing to make modifications to dishes as long as they are able.  I usually order the Penne Mediterranean and change out the sauce and cheese they are always willing and able.  The dish the way I choose to do it is so good and I have even had servers tell me that it should be on the menu that way.

Brio can get pretty busy, especially on weekends so get there early or wait.  The dining room is very large and there is a pretty large patio as well.  There is also dinner service in the bar area.

Brio offers a solid menu and service therefore making it one our favorites."}
{"text":"menu has nice variety for those who like to eat heart healthy. Happy selections are tasty.  Friendly staff and very professional.  Worth a visit..."}
{"text":"A more authentic Olive Garden. 

I like the place, just not blown away. There are so many great Italian places in the Cleveland area and I just don't think Brio can compete. I guess for what it is, it succeeds. It is a more original and authentic chain. It takes the crazy over-Italian of the OG and brings it back a bit. 

I am a fan of the bread for starters. It isn't that greasy white garlic bread at the OG. The atmospheres kinda cool, lively and spacious. 

I generally get some pasta dish here. They have a good version of a chicken Diablo like dish. The savory sauces and spices are always a plus for pasta. It is good food, just not great food. 

The desserts and drinks are always on par. The wine menu is much more impressive than most chains and even some small shops. 

The fact that this one is in Crocker park really makes it feel more chain-like and less authentic. I like coming here but there are so many great options out there, it is hard to justify."}
{"text":"This place is our \"Go-to\" girls night out location and tonight we had the pleasure of meeting James. He was our server and he is TOP NOTCH!! Thank you, James, for not only putting up with us but convincing us you actually enjoyed yourself. We'll be back (sorry James)."}
{"text":"Long story short:

The food was pretty good: 4 out of 5
The ambience/atmosphere: 5 out of 5
The service: 2 out of 5

Based off the reviews I'm reading from this place, the service is pretty mixed. You'll either get an attentive waiter who'll fulfill your needs or have someone who seems like they'd rather be at home than waiting tables. You can tell which type of waiter I got.

With that said, I'd come back though. The food is pretty amazing, but like I said, the service varies here."}
{"text":"My Four Stars is for the bar area and Happy Hour Only which is from 330-6pm & 9pm-close . 

I would of given it a five but place was pretty packed and seating is limited cause they closed the patio area due to it being a bit cold outside. Went here with my mom and brother . We ordered 5 drinks and 4 appetizers which totaled about $56. Not too bad. The appetizers were really really tasty and the portions were decent. Service was pretty good as well ESP for it being happy hour. I would def check this place out again for another happy hour and maybe even dinner ."}
{"text":"A few days after the amazing Yelp event at Brio, I decided to go back to enjoy my FREE bruschetta! This visit was yet again, AMAZING! First off, Kimberly, our waitress, was the most personable, helpful, awesome waitress ever! She was very insightful and suggested some pretty tasty appetizers. I'm not a fan of eggplant, but she assured me it was to-die-for. She was not lying, it was delicious!

They also had the same live music as the Yelp event had and he was just the perfect sound for a happy hour date on the patio.

Then, to top it off, the manager that was hosting the Yelp event came over and introduced himself. Thanked me for going to the Yelp event and for coming back! So hospitable! I felt like I had a second royal treatment!

Thanks Brio, you guys are awesome!! :)"}
{"text":"wife & I thoroughly enjoyed the happy hour appetizers while receiving excellent attention & service from Ken the bartender. We have to go back now & try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Good was very average . Mines was actually cold but this is not the reason for the 3 stars only . I just don't see the hype at all for this place . Wasn't bad at all . Wouldn't return though . Just my opinion"}
{"text":"Not worth the money, I have made better pasta myself. We went last night and 3 of the 4 of us didn't like the food whatsoever, the other person wouldn't pay that price again for the small amount they received."}
{"text":"This is my 3rd time coming to Brio since it's opened and unfortunately I'm never really happy with my experience. I always try to give it another try but my experience is usually the same. The servers are not very friendly almost feel like they get annoyed if you ask for something. I got the chicken limone didn't care for it much. I'm so picky about Italian food... I really wish restaurants would focus on seasoning. My food was pretty bland. My mom got the pasta pesto also very bland.  I wasn't really impressed with the Calamari either. The presentation was wonderful but the food itself was not. It's a beautiful restaurant....Maybe for cocktails but not to dine."}
{"text":"I'm half and half with this place. I went in expecting that there would be a least a few pasta dishes on the menu, but there wasn't. Grudgingly, I settled on another dish of lemon chicken with vegetables. It was good, but it wasn't anything I was amazed with or would encourage me to come back. The same with the dessert: delicious, but not anything amazing.

Oh and they give you bread and the weirdest baked tortilla like thing??? I'm not quite sure how to describe it, but it was just weird and personally, it was kind of a mess to eat.

Lastly, be prepared to wait, not for a table but at your actual table. I felt like the waiters could have been a little faster with the drinks. I don't mind waiting for food, but it kind of sucks when you're super thirsty and your waiter is MIA."}
{"text":"I went on a saturday early afternoon. I noticed alot of staff, but service kind of took awhile. Maybe it was because most of the party weren't at the table, and they (waiters) didn't want to repeat herself. ( i don't know).

Food was different. I wanted some fettucini italian dish. But the one i ordered had ham, and some other pork meat. It was sweat as well. I'm more used to Olive Garden fettucini alfredo. So it was different. I will go back again. Try something else."}
{"text":"Went were walking by and decided to stop I got a few drinks. We had the sangria and it was amazing, if you're in town square and need a refresher on the weekend I'd suggestion stopping by. It's only 8$ per drink and it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Went out to dinner with my son we had a wonderful time sat on patio and we had a wonderful view even The valet parker was nice and helpful The waitress Shell was friendly and engaging recommend it some excellent choices the food was great even the bus person with amazing hair was wonderful The manager Tiffany came over and introduced herself with a bright smile upon receiving the check we excuse ourselves and went to the restroom. We had yummy leftovers that we planned on devouring I'm at the end of our night at home. When we came back to the table all our food was thrown away accidentally. The hostess Alexis was very apologetic and immediately found my server and the manager. Shell was very apologetic and wanted to accommodate us in anyway. The manager Tiffany came right over and apologize and prepared a whole new meal how great now that is some customer service I will be back! The food was wonderful but this service really made our evening thank you for great  great customer service !!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here twice with my husband and daughter. The waiter recommended for my daughter, this very yummy gourmet like Mac and cheese. It was so good my husband ate half of it. I got the prosciutto and burrata mozzarella sandwich. It was delicious. My husband got the cheeseburger and he enjoyed it. Waiters are very good and friendly. Definitely a lovely place with a nice atmosphere for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great food. Not your traditional Italian menu. I bit pricey, but large portions. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Thanks for a great evening and wonderful service by Jess! Food was great, and I loved the suggestions! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I have eaten many times at their Gilbert location and usually enjoyed the food.  Today was National Lasagna Day according to the restaurant, in the email they sent to me almost daily this week.  Lasagna at half price folks, who could resist? I have not missed this holiday with Brio in the past 4 or 5 years and always enjoyed their take on lasagna.  I remember it being better in the past but it has slipped from a 4 to a 3, still quite tasty, perhaps a bit too salty this time.  There are better choices on the menu but it was Lasagna Day!  The locale itself remains elegant and upscale.  The wait staff friendly and efficient.  We had a doctor's appointment to get to and I told our waiter that we needed to be out in 40 minutes, and we were.  Can't wait for Ravioli Day, better than their lasagna.  As usual, it was quite noisy and difficult to have a conversation.  It is good enough to return to fairly often, see you there perhaps:)"}
{"text":"Well I guess I'm a pretty patriotic kind of guy!  My last review of this great restaurant was National Lasagna Day last July and this time National Ravioli Day which might mean that I just love a bargain at half price.  We ordered the two half price ravioli dishes on the menu, Portobello Ravioli with Cremini mushrooms, tomatoes, Parmigiano-Reggiano and fresh thyme in a light champagne brown butter sauce, $8, the better of the two, and Lobster & Shrimp Ravioli $10, prettier than the first but not as great tasting.  Service was impeccable as usual, cleanliness too!  An attractive environment and usually very busy, people know good food. I guess I need to get back here more often and not wait for half price meals :)"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 5 for 6:30 pm.  We arrived and within 5 min were seated.  It was Friday night and it was totally packed and about 50 people hanging in the foyer and out the front door waiting for seating.  The noise level was UNBEARABLE.  I could not hear my husband talking to me and he was right next to me.  The people at the next table were trying to talk but had to yell and they did...non stop...as were everyone in the restaurant.  We were waiting for our other guests but could not take it anymore and gave up our table, called our guests who were just getting out of their car and told them to meet us at Twin Creek that this place was not acceptable to a social evening.  What a shame...it is so beautiful inside.  We have only dined for Brunch outside in their really nice patio...and for that experience I would give it 5 stars...but definitely not the place for a social Friday night .....at least inside the restaurant...outside it was pouring rain, so not an option."}
{"text":"Soup tastes like it just poured from the can. Salad is small and tastes super-salty and acidic, they put some marinated kale all over. Service is slow and pushy for sells, if they make mistake- don't expect apology, they will try to make you buy something else to keep the dinner price up."}
{"text":"I never realized how good the service in Vegas was until I moved out. Aside from the good food, the place itself is beautiful and the waitresses and waiters I've had have always been kind and knowledgeable. I will definitely miss this place :')"}
{"text":"Loved this place service was excellent waiter was ver thoughtful we went there Thursday Jan 26 party of 5 food was great the only thing we couldn't find a handicap parking anywhere close outside matter of fact never did find one anywhere atmosphere was very nice  I has had the lobster and stuffed shrimp everything on the table was excellent"}
{"text":"Went for birthday dinner with my daughter, along with wife and mother-in-law.  Had been here before for happy hour and it was pretty decent but we only ate appetizers that time. Decided to give it a try for dinner.

Since it was a special day, we went all out.  Drinks, appetizers, salad, entrees, and one dessert.  All in all, the food was only fair (except the shrimp and eggplant appetizer-wonderful!) and we were pretty disappointed.  Over $200 with the tip left me with sticker shock as well.

Bottom line - if you want Olive Garden quality food, go to Olive Garden and save yourself a bunch of money.  Or...stick with happy hour and some appetizers."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and was \"waited\" on by the world's least attentive waitress. For $30- no appetizer, lunch lasagna and one glass of wine- I at least expect the service to be good. I'd like to point out that she didn't seem particularly interested in any of her tables. The lunch lasagna comes with a wedge salad. The salad isn't bad, but it sucked that she dumped both that and the lasagna on the table at the same time. I'm not sure if the lasagna was served hot since by the time I got to it, it was lukewarm. Also- no offer of a refill or grated cheese, in fact the next time I saw my server was when she dropped off my check- still no offer of a refill, dessert, bread, etc. Taking her not-so-subtle hint I put my card in the booklet and then proceeded to wait, and wait, and wait. During this time I picked at my lasagna and ruminated that it looked like cat food and tasted like school cafeteria food. Ugh. I left her a standard 20% tip and told the manager how pissed I was at wasting $30 and a good tip on this crappy restaurant. Save yourself money and time and find anywhere else."}
{"text":"The Happy Hour at Brio is extremely jolly!  We love the offerings at the Brio at Town Square in Las Vegas, and thought we would try the Phoenix version of the same restaurant.  We dropped in on a Wednesday for Happy Hour  before going to a film, and were astonished by the size of the portions.  Some of the items were similar to Vegas\" menu, but the servings of the Shrimp and Eggplant and the Pizza Margarita were twice if not three times as big!  Delicious spicy shrimp and crispy flatbread pizza accompanied by two large Margaritas made for a great preview to coming attractions.
The space at this restaurant is also more generous, and we were able to eat inside in unhurried luxury!"}
{"text":"Okay, I wised up and had a Bellini, the beautiful Italian cocktail combining peaches and Proseco (sparkling white wine).  It was smooth as silk, icy cold and slid down my throat.   I had just had the pleasure of the drink at Harry's Bar and the Four Seasons in Florence, so the Bellini had some tough competition, but withstood the test!

We chose the scrumptious and spicy shrimp and egglant, the shrimptini, and punctuated it with the sliders, which turned out to be one big burger cut in quarters.
We preferred the steak bruschetta, but enjoyed the happy hour fun before our golf lesson across the street!

Funny waitress, and a great table in the shade near the bar!"}
{"text":"Last night (New Year's Eve) was my first time at Brio, and my friend and I came in for dinner before going out. It was busy, which was expected, but were able to find a perfect little table for two in the bar area. I'm not going to sugar-coat it - once we sat down, we waited for a really long time to get our order taken, to get our wine and bread, and to get our meals. But on busy nights even at good places, things can go wrong - and I'm a firm believer that it is 100% about how staff and management handle themselves. Brio did an excellent job at recovering our experience. Our wine order wasn't put in and we had to flag the manager down after 15 minutes of wondering what was up, but she got our wine to us, and took the glasses off the bill. In fact, while we were having dinner, our server even brought us over two extra glasses. (The wine was delicious, one of their pinot noirs, but I can't remember exactly which one.)

I didn't know what to expect out of our food since I'd never been here, but I was really impressed - the food is so good! I had a hard time deciding between their chicken pesto pomodoro, the pasta alla vodka and the pasta brio, but I decided on the pasta brio (rigatoni, roasted red pepper sauce, mushrooms and grilled chicken) since it's their signature dish and came highly recommended by our server. It was SO delicious and very flavorful - it wasn't spicy but still had the kick I crave! My friend had their chicken pesto over angel hair and didn't really love their pesto- according to our server it isn't true pesto - its base is chicken broth? So maybe that was why. But he ate it and had some of my pasta brio, and we both agreed that dish was incredible.

Coming in on such a busy holiday, I think everyone at Brio handled themselves very well, even when there were mishaps. The atmosphere was really nice - had good lighting and seemed sophisticated but also jovial. And you can't beat the location - Tivoli Village is so pretty. I loved our experience here and can't wait to come back and bring my husband!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in Gilbert! The service is great and the food is so yummy! Especially loving the new items on the menu! The Burrata & Ciabatta, always love the bruschetta sampler, kale caesar salad,   Espresso Rubbed Ribeye, the salmon Fresca, and the strawberry shortcake!"}
{"text":"We've been here several times.  Usually for happy hour, or \"reverse\" happy hour (after 9pm).  Note that happy hour on Friday does NOT include drink specials, just food (go figure).  One time we ate in the dining room.  This review will be about the happy hour and bar menu.

The food here isn't really authentic Italian.  But it's good.  They're shooting for \"high class\" while remaining \"casual\".  We've sampled everything on their bar menu, and it's all good.  The \"Brio burgers\" are tasty, the flatbread pizzas are almost authentic and pretty good, I didn't really care for the dip but my wife liked it, and the beef on bruschetta is really good.  And you can feed four people for under $20 pretty easily if you are doing happy hour.

The bar area is a little loud, and a bit small.  It can be difficult to see any of their TVs because you have to twist around and/or crane your neck to see.  The booths are about the only places where it's easy to watch, and they only have two of them.  It is not uncommon for the bar area to be full, but they will honor happy hour specials in the outdoor seating accessible from the bar area."}
{"text":"Love their food! We had my daughter's baptism party here and the manager Jenna was very nice and helpful during the arrangements.  The staff was very attentive the only thing is that it seemed they tried to get too many of us to sit in a too small of space so we were a bit squished. Other than that the food was of course excellent. 
We also have been there for brunch. Their breakfast food is not as good as their regular stuff.
Love the location. So nice to sit outside in the evenings and look at the surroundings."}
{"text":"The happy hours here Rock. Get here early otherwise you'll be waiting for a seat so Mike and Madison can take care of you. You won't be disappointed. Everything from the pepper shrimp to the Beef Carpaccio to the Caprese salad to the Brio burger and potato skins."}
{"text":"I love this place ... It never disappoint .. The food always delicious and the Sirvece is really nice and the atmosphere just amazing"}
{"text":"Excellent Italian Food!  I've been a few times and the Happy Hour is the way to go for value!  In a nice/new shopping center Town Center Mall."}
{"text":"My husband (the lucky one of us) won a gift card to this restaurant, so we planned a nice meal here with another couple for double date night.  Normally we wouldn't venture so far from home base, but we weren't disappointed.  It was a lovely experience.  (Did I just use the word \"lovely\"?  Yes...I think I did.  Huh, that was weird.)

We'd made reservations for a Saturday night and were seated right away.  All the hostesses and servers were super friendly and polite.  The restaurant was very busy, so the open dining area was somewhat loud, making conversation a bit challenging at times, but we'd been there before so knew what to expect.  It has a very open feel.  Certainly not intimate or private, if that's what you're looking for. 

We ordered an appetizer of Spinach Artichoke Dip, served with Parmesan flatbread, which was very good...but the bread seemed more like large pieces of cracker.  I wasn't a huge fan, felt like the dip needed some thicker, fluffier bread to really make the most of it.  But it did all get eaten.  The couple we were with ordered a single glass of wine, mentioning to the server that they would be sharing it, so the server brought out two glasses and poured very generously for each, which was nice.  My friend ordered lobster bisque and said it was delicious, although it was only lukewarm when it arrived, so she very sweetly asked if she could have it heated up a bit.  The server was gracious and accommodating, did not make us feel as though we were putting her out at all.

For main dishes, I honestly don't recall what the other couple ordered, but they did seem pleased.  I ordered the Ravioli di Bello...yum!!!  My husband ordered the Whole Roasted Chicken and let me tell you, that was a LOT of food.  The plate they brought out for him covered about a quarter of the entire surface area of the table.  For a guy, that's probably alright I guess, but if I'd ordered the whole chicken and they brought that plate out to me, I personally would've wanted to crawl beneath the table from embarrassment.  Anyway, my hubs is a pretty big guy and even he couldn't finish the entire plate, so he ended up boxing some of it for later.

Both times I've eaten here, I've really enjoyed the food and service.  The prices are to be expected on that side of town, so at least you get a lot of food for what you pay for.  All in all, a great experience.  And don't forget to check in on Yelp for a free Tuscan Taster with beverage!"}
{"text":"It's nice to go to a restaurant that remembers how important the little things are. The food is awesome and the service is great as well, we sat in Michelle's section and she is hands down one of the best servers we've had in long time!"}
{"text":"Been here 10 minutes and every single wait person walks by with eyes averted. No acknowledgement whatsoever. Debating whether to leave. 

UPDATE: We finally got noticed! The nice manager apologized and gave us a free appetizer. When our nice meal was done, our server said she talked to him and they comped the whole meal! 

Food here is very good. Not the best ever but we've been before and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is very good, service is great.  Always been treated well here.  

My favorite things about this place:
-the bread basket
-drinks are good
-tiny decadent desserts"}
{"text":"Hmmmm. I would say our visit was a 6/10. We had a party of 10 with two waiters. Food was a 8/10. Decor and setting 8/10. Problem was food was missing from different orders and my husbands lamb dish never made it to the table until everyone else was finished eating their meal. (We were eventually told it would be a little bit before it would be out, so he asked everyone to eat while their food was warm.) The staff was polite and helpful, offering to comp my husbands dish. That is nice, but he came to dine with his party. We will pass and try somewhere else next time. There is a lot of establishment competition out there to make mistakes like forgetting someone's entire meal."}
{"text":"First time coming here and probably last... the moment we got there no host was in the front to sit us as I had to go walk to the bar to tell someone to sit my daughter and I. Finally we got seated and began to look at the menu, dinner time. My daughter was set on the shrimp and lobster fettuccini. Took me awhile to have my mind set as the menu choice was great. Many things to pick from. I ended up getting the beef short ribs. Quite a wait must I say. Very upset too our server was just rude (wish I got the name). I kept looking around and saw there was bread at the tables with people eating and we did not get any so I figured it wasn't complimentary. We got our food after a wait and my daughter politely asked our server if the bread was complimentary and why we didn't get any and she straight up goes, \"it is but you should've asked earlier, your meals already here.\" I had to bite my tongue as I know my daughter didn't want to cause a scene. My short ribs were dry right off the spot. And I expected a thicker meat. I look over to my daughters and it looks great! But where was the shrimp and lobster?! It was just sauce, pasta, and tomatoes etc. she loves seafood too so she was pretty bummed out. We both just ate it as we were about to spend money on this meal we could've made at home. 

I wanted to get her dessert because she's been with her mother a couple days so I just wanted to make the dinner better but the \"warm chocolate cake\" wasn't even warm. We were over it already. Slow seating, rude sever, and disappointing food. Would I go back to try it again? Possibly. But this whole experience was just sad."}
{"text":"Writing this as I am sitting at the table waiting for the waiter to come back, it's been over 15 mins and our server is no where to be found. The food was very good, but the service was lacking. I could understand if the restaurant was really busy, but it's almost closing time and there are only 3 total tables seated right now. If I could split the rating for service and food separately I would give them a 5 for the food, and a 2 for service. I've come here many times, and always had great service, but tonight is definitely is far from it."}
{"text":"A great place to eat, but you will be wanting more after your meal. Unless you are already full out of your mind, that is."}
{"text":"Went to Brio's with my bday group of 8 girlfriends.  I, and 2 others ordered the calamari, and unfortunately we were disappointed in it. The manager came over and took replacement orders from us for the steak salads. He then credited 3 out of the 9 lunch orders to apologise for our initial disappointment.  What can I say, service like that makes me very loyal, and all my friends agreed we would continue to visit Brio's where the food is always tasty and the service is impeccable. Thank you to the manager for making my lunch special for me instead of the disaster it could have been."}
{"text":"3.5/5. Stopped in before a movie for a few drinks and appetizers today (Sunday afternoon). It was pricy, but we knew that in advance. I might have given five stars, but we listened to several female bartenders complain over... and over... and over again about what a bad day they had at work. We get it- it was busy. Please be more mindful of what your patrons are listening to. The side of the bar we were on was empty- there certainly wasn't a wait for the restaurant. It was a bummer to listen to them complain. They were VERY nice to us- food was amazing- the mood was just a bummer. We'll think twice before coming back with so many other nearby options. No weekend happy hour."}
{"text":"Seems too foo foo to me.  not sure why.  the food is fine but it seems like upscale for the sake of upscale.  If it had a view of something other than a mall maybe it would feel different."}
{"text":"Been there twice for dinner and both times were good. Big open room which gets kind of noisy, but it's a fun place. This is a chain, somewhere between Carabas and Maggianos. I tend to get the veal piccata type of dish at Italian places as a measure, and the veal here was very good. the wines were reasonable, waitstaff attentive, food was good. I looked over at my friend's lasagna and it looked gooey, sloppy, whatever to me. He enjoyed it. The prices were reasonable enough to put Brio on the list for a night out during the week."}
{"text":"The reviews are all over the map so far for this recent entry into the Kierland-area restaurant scene - and for good reason. It seems that for each pro there exists an equivalent con. 
On arrival, you will find a choice between extremely inconvenient parking or $6 valet service. Not unusual in this area, but nonetheless irritating.
I have visited twice now, both times for lunch, mixed results. Generally speaking, the food is constructed of quality ingredients, presented in an appealing way and won't leave you hungry. 
Service both in the dining area and the bar was amateurish, as is normal for a chain. Timing was way off.
Once seated, we were presented with a bread basket as we ordered drinks. The bread was fresh and warm, and a nice start. Drinks arrived correctly, but I have had better coffee at .... well, everywhere.
We placed our orders, each of our party of three finding something on the menu that we were interested in trying.
As we waited for our meals, we observed the operations throughout the dining room, as seperations between tables were low. While this made for interesting people-watching, conversation was nearly impossible, with nothing to buffet the cacophony of flatware meeting dishes. 
Salads arrived, and they were fairly large if uninteresting. Entrees followed: pastas were very good, hot, tasty and with no shortage of garlic. Pizza however was a flat, soggy mess. 
Dessert tray consisted of a collection of espresso cups filled with a variety of standard offerings. One of the two selected contained a little surprise - a piece of cardboard. I did not order a replacement.
They might have garnered another star, but then we got the check. At about $15 per person, not including tip, we were left feeling quite underwhelmed. 
Altogether, I am left with very little reason to return."}
{"text":"The best food I have EVER eaten!  My mouth danced the whole time.  Beautiful and unique admosphete and exceptional service. Ahhhhhhhh!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Pesto pasta, shrimp Alfredo, spinach dip by the fire. The atmosphere is very mood setting with dim lights and decent music. Price is reasonable. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great atmosphere. It's an excellent place for a date. 
The bruschetta is incredible to start and save a little room for dessert to top it all off. 
It'll be a regular for us. Very highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went for the happy hour (Monday-Friday 3-6:30, Monday-Thursday 9-closing). Must admit was very impressed with the apps for $3.95. Ordered the burger, artichoke dip and the ravioli. Bartender was friendly enough to tell me the eggplant shrimp is the best thing they've got, so I take him up on it.

He was right, the eggplant shrimp was very, very good, and I don't even like shrimp that much. Ravioli was good too, I'd probably get it again. Burger had a charred taste to it I liked. The burger was pretty simple, but hey, it's $3.95.

For the drinks I believe they only have Sangrias, Martinis, wine, and Mojitos for $5. No beer as far as I could tell.

The bartenders seemed nice and knew the regulars by name, the ambiance is good, parking is easy in Tivoli Village, and the prices for happy hour are worth it. Nice spot for a slightly more \"upscale\" happy hour at cheap prices."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place and was really excited to try it but my experience was awful. I never write negative reviews but this was exceptionally terrible. The waitress acted like she was bothered serving us, she almost stabbed my mother (slid a sharp knife across the table instead of handing it) and didn't bring us silverware after we asked several times (not sure why it wasn't already on the table). Anyway the food was mediocre at best, I've had better Italian food at Olive Garden. I had a Caesar salad, but I tried the chicken and penne ala vodka. My chicken was burnt and the others were just ok. Aside from a hair in the food and sticky silverware. Will not visit again."}
{"text":"Love their happy hour. Once of the best ones in town. It use to be 2.95 awhile back ago. They raised the appetizer prices to 3.95... but seriously, it's worth it. 3.95 is still a steal especially for this girl! 

Not much of a bar area compared to their other location at town square. It's also quite busy so if you don't go there early, you may not get a seat. 

Appetizers we ordered:
1) Brio burger: Cut into 4. Simple burger.. but really well done. A fluffy bread with a juicy patty. 
2) Ravioli Caprese: 5 pieces of breaded cheese ravioli. Fried to perfection. 
3) Beef Carpaccio: MY FAVORITE DISH. Thinly sliced salty meat. What more could you ask for?
4) Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant: Another delicious dish.
5) Crispy Shrimp Piccante: Boyfriend l

It was more than enough for the both of us but we seriously wanted to try everything. 
The drinks are delicious. Just martinis mostly. No beer. But well, it's all good. Cause I have my 3.95 appetizers."}
{"text":"Oh Brio, I wish I met your happy hour sooner. 

For your dining pleasure (during M-F, 3 to 7 & M-Th 9 to close), TUSCAN TASTERS FOR 2.95! Woop woop! Good quality food for such a little price. 

The service was great despite the fact that the server was by herself (or so I overheard). Sarah was her name. She managed to keep a smile on her face and was very polite.

The best plate from my happy hour was the Spicy shrimp and eggplant. The crusted eggplant had a sligh crunch and paired nicely with the black pepper cream sauce. However, the shrimp tasted spicier than the eggplant for some reason. 

The Brio Burger was decent.. Go for the other tasters instead. 

I also enjoyed the sliced steak bruschetta. The tender pieces of steak were topped with yummy gorgonzola.

I wish there was drink specials on the menu... ::sad face::

The seating area in the bar was very nice. There was two lounge areas complete with a love seat and arm chairs. Luckily, I got there in time to bag one!

The mini desserts looked so good but I choose just one. The vanilla creme brulee. The strawberries tasted so well with the vanilla custard. I which I ordered three of them! One was simply not enough!!

Brio! I've never been to Italy but I think you just gave me a small taste of it!"}
{"text":"It was good, but not good enough to justify the prices. I will admit that the service didn't seem like a franchise place, it felt more intimate and welcoming and the setting is nice. The price to food quality ratio was a little off though."}
{"text":"A very nice restaurant. If you ever wonder about a good appetizer you've got to try the Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant is hands down the best appetizer there!!!
It is a little spicy because if the pepper, but it is delicious! I think that the eggplant just adds an amazing flavor to it and your palate will thank you. Try it and thank me later"}
{"text":"The Tres Leches is just delicious! It is really a challenge to get it right (the Tres Leches) but they pretty much nailed it! Basically a good place to come with the kids and let them pig out lol"}
{"text":"The Sourdough was amazing, the server suggested Olive Oil and Parm, fantastic. Food amazing (Shrimp Mediterranean) and shout out to Tony the server, really great!"}
{"text":"My husband and I going out for Happy Hour every other Friday night.  We go to a different location every time as there are so many different places in Las Vegas.  
Brio had advertised a $5.00 Martini. I selected one of the specially priced Martini's but when I received the bill, I had been charged $8.99 for it. I asked my server and she ignored me.  
The $2.95 small plates were good but after being charged incorrectly and ignored, I'll never go back again."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for brunch for our birthday month brunch celebration.  We went in around 3 pm on a Sunday and the wait was only 10 minutes.  (Just a little side info: the pager that they give you to tell you that your table is ready will work across the way at Victoria Secret!)  Once we sat down, we were greeted by our server who immediately asked what we wanted for drinks.  Although it wasn't listed on the menu, they offer a carafe of mimosas.  When we asked the server about it, she wasn't sure if they do that and had to go and check if that was possible.  The server returned saying that it was possible and she told us that it would be $18.  We felt like that was a better deal amongst the 2 of us.  One glass of mimosa was already $6.  The carafe ended up being 2 and a half glasses each! 

I ordered the open faced chicken avocado omelet and my friend ordered the ravioli di bello. Since we came for brunch, I decided on a brunch dish, but was also interested in the ravioli.  My friend beat me to it!  While we were waiting for the food, bread and butter was brought out to the table. The food itself was delish although I wished that I had gotten the ravioli di bello! The flavors in that was amaze! It made my chicken avocado omelet seem a bit bland."}
{"text":"What to say...  The appetizer we had at lunch is the only reason they are getting two stars instead of one.  The artichoke dip was pretty good, nothing super, but pretty good.  Had the shrimp and crab crepes for brunch.  Scrambled eggs, shrimp, crab, and asparagus rolled up in crepe served with fresh fruit and fried red potatoes.  Sounds awesome.  It was far from it,  To start off the smell of the over ripe melon in the fresh fruit overwhelmed my plate with a horrible smell.  Strike one.  Next I moved to the potatoes, over cooked to the point that  they were black and burnt to a crisp.  Strike two.  Next the crepes, the eggs were over cooked and dry, there was not crab or shrimp in them, the asparagus was flavorless and overcooked, and the hollandaise sauce taste like something out of a box or package.  Strike three.  Sadly they had a fourth strike as well.  Everything on my plate was the same temperature, the crepes and the potatoes were cold, and the fruit was warm.  I try to give everyplace a second chance, but I am not sure this place is worthy of that."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service was not good at all. Our server was annoyed most of the questions we had. Believe me I get it.....it can be annoying but we literally asked 4 questions, maybe 1 too many for her. (I wish I could remember her name) 
I asked about the raspberry mojito and told her I didn't want it that strong if they can please put extra raspberries. She looked at me like I asked her for her social security number. Lol
My drink was beyond strong. Of course she didn't make it so it wasn't her fault but I asked if she can have them put a little more of the raspberry syrup in it. She said \"it's not syrup it's fresh actual raspberries\" (with attitude) woah! Okay then we'll can you ask them to not make it strong please. 
She charged me for 2 drinks. By the end of the night I was exhausted talking to her and we paid the bill and left. 
I don't know if I would go back."}
{"text":"Had a table of 12 for a birthday celebration. Ordered some appetizers for the table, artichoke dips, bruschetta etc. All were good, dips came with a nice bread and lavosh. Salads were tasty, portions average. Orders varied from cod with grilled veggies and pasta  to Beef Medallions with Gorgonzola. All was very good, dinner portions a little small. Service was very good, friendly and quick. Definitely recommend. Dishes were a little pricey, but that is to be expected with the minimum wage increase."}
{"text":"I've had lunch here a couple of times and dinner once.  I love the patio seating and people watching.  The food is good, and the service is better than you would expect from a chain.  I love the different items on the lighter side menu.  Great place do dine with friends."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Not the best, but a lot better then Olive Garden or Macaroni Grille."}
{"text":"Great dining experience.  I typically love Brio for business lunches but decided to bring a date for dinner.  She loved it.

Started with the bruschetta quatro.  4 different types of bruschetta.  All delicious.  I ordered the crab and shrimp cakes.  Very tasty with large pieces of crab and shrimp throughout.  My date ordered the tilapia which was cooked perfectly.  

All with a few glasses of sangria thrown in made for a lovely date."}
{"text":"Brio is amazing.  I've never had a bad entrée or a bad experience.  This is across a couple of locations and a good stretch of time.  

Love coming here for lunch, business or personal.  The strawberry chicken balsamic salad... wow.  Maybe my favorite salad ever.  That being said everything is good.  Try the salmon,  try the gorgonzola crusted beef medallions.  It's all good. 

Bottom line, come here, eat well and have some vino."}
{"text":"No greeting at the front door from the hostesses (of which there were 2). Two other couples were waiting to be seated upon checking in but no one acknowledged us until they were sat and that acknowledgment was gruff and unfriendly. Our server made up for it with a great attitude, wonderful suggestions, and a genuinely positive attitude. I had wanted to leave but am glad I didn't because of the service once we were sat."}
{"text":"I give two stars strictly because the customer service was TERRIBLE, I guess we came late and agitated our server, but who knows. The food was very good I had a flatbread that was excellent and the carpaccio was also good and HUGE. The mall that Brio is located in could really use a jolt of electricity, but that seems to be all too familiar these days with the funky economy."}
{"text":"This is as good as it gets for Happy Hour. I am only rating Happy Hour. Brio, Monday to Thursday, 9pm to close at the bar, $2.95 per Tuscan Taster, which are supposed to be appetizers but are the size of entrees. $5 Martini Thursdays can apply to the Tuscan Taster Happy Hour special, and if it's not Thursday, but you have a card to show that you're in the food and beverage industry, you can get $5 martinis even if it's not Thursday. 

They used to have the Steak Bruschetta, but they took that off the menu and replaced it with the Mozzarella Red Pepper Bruschetta with Arugula. Anyway, to the food.

Brio Burger: ordered this at medium, came with crisp chips and a nice plain brioche bun. The meat was delicious and fresh. The chips were really crispy. Dip this in the tomato sauce of the

Ravioli Caprese: 3 pieces of ravioli, circular, with cheese topped with basil and tomatoes. 

Beef Carpaccio: paper-thin slices of raw beef (about 6) with a little aioli, capers, some leafy greens, and a pizza-shaped slice of crisp flatbread. Everything was fresh and tasted great.

Sausage and Pepperoni Flatbread: Crisp flatbread baked in a wood-fire oven comes topped with bits of sausage and pepperoni cut into four triangles.

Food deserves 4 stars. Service from Nicole M. deserves 5 stars as we only had happy hour items and raspberry iced tea, but she still treated us like any other guest, and ambience and happy hour menu deserve 5 stars. I have been to Brio Tuscan Grille about 5 times for their night time happy hour.

Give this place a shot if you haven't tried it yet for happy hour. You'll be surprised - pleasantly while enjoying the view of the Colosseum and the background Italian music that so dearly reminds me of Firenze, Italia."}
{"text":"I have now gone to Brio several times and my experience is always the same, GREAT!! The ambiance is sophisticated but laid back. I had a party of 3 and we were offered the outside patio or inside for seating with little wait. The menu can be a little intimidating but our waiters have always been very helpful. You receive warm bread that's freshly baked. Their lasagna was super rich but you could definitely taste all the cheeses and meat. The Filetto Di Manzo Toscano steak is always cooked perfectly! I have never had a steak cooked and done so well! We also asked for the grilled salmon which was just as delicious. All the plates came warm and in big portions. I recommend the peach sangria! You can't go wrong with any of their dishes. Fabulous work their chef is doing!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming to Brio whenever we're in Vegas. The food is delicious, the service is efficient and friendly, and the ambiance is very classy. The last time we ate at Brio for lunch, we were starving so we ordered an appetizer, entree, and dessert. 

Steak Bruschetta - The bread and arugula tasted so fresh and the steak had great seasoning. I definitely recommend ordering this for your appetizer! 

Pasta Carbonara - My boyfriend loves ordering carbonara whenever we go out for Italian food and has ordered it from Brio in the past. However, the carbonara during this visit was very bland and tasted like it needed more seasoning. 

Pasta Alla Vodka - Delicious! The creamy marinara sauce was very flavorful and the ricotta filled ravioli were so good. I'm definitely going to be ordering this next time.

Chocolate Molten Lava Cake - One of the best lava cakes we've ever had. The caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream paired perfectly with the rich chocolate lava cake. We scarfed down the dessert within minutes. 

Overall, Brio is an excellent Italian restaurant and the quality of the food and service is always up to par."}
{"text":"If this review was solely based on the happy hour it would be a solid 5 star . So if your like me and you hunt for the best happy hours out there this is definitely one of the best ! They have huge portions and the food deals are $4,$5 & $6 . 

I like the beef carpaccio $4, black pepper shrimp $6, caprese salad $5 and the eggplant fries $4. They also have good deals for the drinks . But keep in mind that happy hour is available only in the bar area ! It's from 3:30-6:30 Monday - Friday . 

I've eaten here non happy hour a few times , and it was okay , it's a totally different experience in my opinion. I had the risotto and it was okay portions were good but it did not wow me . 

The main area is really pretty and they have outdoor seating as well so you can people watch if that's your thing . For hot days , they also have mists to keep their patrons cool on their patio. 

I love you brio !"}
{"text":"Fancier than olive garden but not stuffy.  A little overpriced for Italian food that I can make at home.  It's really yummy though and sitting on the patio during a cool night is sublime.  Nearby shopping makes for an entertaining evening and a nice after dinner stroll.  Servers are very accommodating.  We asked to move to a table near a heater and they were more than happy to move us."}
{"text":"Ok food. Ok service. I had the lobster bisque which was good but only one piece of lobster. My husband had the rotisserie chicken, good but dry. Our server was nice but every time she approach d the table she must have decided we were ok, so she turned and walked away before communicating. Food came out quickly but almost too quickly between courses. I will probably try out another place in Scottsdale before returning."}
{"text":"Brio is an Italian restaurant whose main view overlooks the parking lot, but the patio is spacious and perfect for cooler nights.

I love Italian food, so I was stoked to try their Tuscan recipes. I 'm not sure I ever want to dine there again after my experience, though.

Our server was wonderful (actually, all the servers who came up to our table were wonderful), and the food and drinks came out promptly. We received freshly baked white bread first, which was soft with a crispy crust. It was good but nothing exciting.

I then dug into a Brio Chopped Salad ($4.95), my favorite part of the meal. It was so huge, I should have just ordered that alone. I loved it-it had tomatoes, olives, onion, cucumber and Feta cheese, and I had it with ranch instead of the usual red wine vinaigrette it usually comes with. It was a really well-rounded salad, and the portion was a great deal for the price.

I had still ordered Mushroom Ravioli Al Forno ($14.95), which I got with BRIO's tomato parmesan cream sauce instead of alfredo. The sauce was really bland to me-usually it's my favorite sauce because of the kick it has, but this had none. Also, the pasta was sort of rubbery-definitely not handmade. I took most of my meal home, which was boxed for me.

When I ate the rest of it later at home, I almost (thank gosh I didn't) bit into a pea-sized piece of ceramic. I have no idea how that got in the box, but it was buried under the pasta and would have chipped my teeth if I hadn't have noticed it before biting into it. That, combined with my lack of enthusiasm for the pasta, leaves me with no desire to rush back, no matter how awesome that salad was.

My friend got Smoked Chicken and Portobello Brushcetta ($11.75). She said the consistency was weird, and to me, the presentation also looked sloppy, as well.
 
I'd recommend going to True Food Kitchen before BRIO."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this very pleasant atmosphere at brio and my spaghetti with spicy sauce I come here for a special occasion to spend time with my family"}
{"text":"I really love brio and have been coming here mug too often lately. Their food is always good.. lunch, dinner or weekend. Ranch.. yes they served brunch, who would have thought. My favorite is their happy hour, you can be sealed anywhere and don't have to fight over a chair in the bar like typical places, you can actually bring the whole family and enjoy the great food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've been here over 6 times and the food is about the same as the Cheesecake factory. Lunch time is a good time to come because the salads are cheap and the carpaccio is a good portion.

Fish dishes for dinner are quite good. I've tried several and none have been overcooked. That's good for consistency.

There's nothing special about the wine list but the choices are alright. The great thing about this place is the outside seating."}
{"text":"Brio has fantastic food. It's great for brunch, lunch, dinner, bday dinner, etc. 9/10, we get great service. Love their happy hour. Love their bread and cocktails. Outside seating is awesome when the weather is nice and they even have an outdoor bar."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Service was great, food was delicious.  We highly recommend the pork chop it's huge and juicy. The Alfredo was perfect!"}
{"text":"This place it's better if you come by yourself , because it's great , amazing staff delicious food but it is &
$$ if you don't want to spend more then 20$ don't come here . I usually don't repeat restaurants , but definitely I will come again . I got Fresca Salmon which is potatoes , tomatoes , asparagus , spinach I was surprise with the ingredients  cause it also had fresh cheese which was odd for me but as soon as a taste it I fall in love for dessert don't forget to ask for warm chocolate cake as well as the white wine collection"}
{"text":"Brio is the perfect restaurant to visit after a long day of shopping! In fact, when the Quarter first opened up and H & M arrived, my sister and I made it a girl's night out and after several hours of shopping at H & M, enjoyed wine and dinner on the patio at Brio. It was such a fun night and the Brio patio was calm and relaxing. 

Fast forward a couple of years and now the Quarter is thriving with many more shops and restaurants, but Brio still remains a favorite to me. I think this is the perfect restaurant for families who have kids and want to have a nice dinner at a restaurant, but in an environment where the kids won't stand out if they get a little louder than normal. This is also a perfect restaurant for a date night on the patio or when you have friends in town or need a nice dinner spot for one with the parents. It's really a good all-around restaurant, especially the patio! 

The food here is hearty, filling and tasty Italian cuisine. My go-to favorite dish are the lobster raviolis. I don't know what they do to the sauce, but it's a perfect combination of creamy and sweet and goes perfectly with the ravioli. I really enjoy their chopped salad as well and it has a perfect blend of fresh veggies. For dessert, you must try the chocolate souffle. Oh my! I go into the evening planning on having one bite and find myself having 10!"}
{"text":"It just keeps getting better. The Sweet Potato Risotto is amazing, and so is the Tournedos Di Manzo. I have yet to have desert still... I really need to get on that.

I've decided the Town Square location is much nicer than the Tivoli Village one- although the service at Tivoli seemed slightly better."}
{"text":"I've come here many times and have always had a great experience. However this time was a bit different. We ordered our food from the server in a timely manner and waited for the food to arrive. When it did one of the items was incorrect and I pointed this out to the service staff but was told no this is the item you ordered. After checking the menu it clearly was not. That was quite frustrating. No one checked back to be sure we were enjoying our food. When we were done eating we asked for some to go boxes. The server brought two boxes but nothing for the pizza. We waited 20 mins for the server to come back. We asked him for another box and the check. We proceeded to wait another ten mins before we were paid out and ready to leave. Very slow service and frustrated with incorrect items ordered."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here and my second time eating at this chain. I wanted a Cesar salad with the same steak they out on the steak salad. The waiter who was rude from the get go said then I should order the steak salad with Cesar dressing with only romaine. Kind of odd but ok. When my salad came out it's had romaine lettuce, blue cheese Cesar dressing and a vinaigrette on it. We told him this is not what we ordered. He tried to argue with us and walked away mad. My salad was finally brought out correctly. 

Bad customer service and slow service"}
{"text":"Awesome place for lunch. Very nice atmosphere and love the patio area.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great manager, Marlin, great server, Jennifer.  Pasta and other dishes were excellent,  2 night in a row. Will definitely come back.  High recommendations!!! Beef carpaccio excellent,  great pasta  and veal milanese!"}
{"text":"Food is always amazing, I've never had a single complaint. One of my favorite Italian spots!"}
{"text":"After recently returning from Italy I discovered the Brio Tuscan Grill while shopping at the Apple Store.  With a new appreciation for Italian food I tried the Risotto and Insalata on the lunch menu.  

The Bistecca Insalata (a quarter cut of head lettuce and creamy ranch dressing with tomatoes and bacon) was crispy and tasty.  It could almost make a meal by itself with a glass of red Tuscan wine along with the seed filled crackers for extra taste.

The Risotto with Shrimp and Scallop was a small but adequate portion.  A little more flavor but not nearly the size nor quality of fresh shellfish I had along the waterfront in the Fishing Village below the town of Sorrento.

All in all a good new spot for lunch on the patio as fall finally approaches the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"How is it that we find ourselves in Scottsdale so often? Ugh. But, when you have an opportunity to partake in some lunch with a bestie.... 

We had heard that Brio was really good, and it did not disappoint. The hostess at the front was nice, sweet, and had a great sense of humor. We were seated promptly, and ordered Arnold Palmers and water for 3 as we waited for our 3rd. The lemonade is fresh squeezed and made in house. Honestly, the AP's were BOMB!

I ordered the Chef's Special pasta, which had bacon (MMMMM BAAACON!) and carmelized onions in it. It was good, but the Lobster Bisque I ordered before my entree showed up was exquisite.

GF ordered a breaded chicken salad, which I had a couple of bites of, and I thought it was great too. 

Service was top notch, and the price was fair. All together a great experience. 

I love the interior decor, as well. It is well lit from above, but not too bright from the sides. The lights are super cool also. 

Looking forward to going back for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"This place is very nice inside. Fancy. The food was good but I wouldn't rate it more than 3 stars. They do have a pretty nice presentation though"}
{"text":"Happy hour was great! Food was great too. Everyone was very pleased with the quality and portions were pretty big."}
{"text":"Service was great, the bruschetta was decent but rest of the food was so incredibly bad. We ordered two main entrees and a kids meal- all were not worth eating. I really hope we don't have to eat here again. Sorry brio!"}
{"text":"The dining room is comfortable and offers a variety of seating. Also there is a shaded outdoor patio. Happy Hour  lounge indoor and outdoor seating  is a great deal with food and drinks.
On this visit we had dinner in the dining room. The room was conversation friendly. For a starter we chose the Bruschetta Quattro which was wonderful. Our entrees were the Chicken Limone and Cioppino. The Chicken was a large portion, very moist
and perfectly cooked. The Cioppino arrived with 2 clams and 1 mussel that were not open. Our waitress apologized and reported the problem to the chef. She returned with a large plate of clams and mussels and again apologized. The Cioppino had a good variety of seafood and I would order it again. Overall Brio has a large menu with something for everyones taste. The service is professional and timely."}
{"text":"Spontaneity kicked in.  I'm here; I'm hungry!  Feed me, BRIO!!!  Take me on a mental escape to Tuscany! Okay too quick...  What happened to my food?!  

I ate it.

I'll have to return for another escape.  Signed up for their loyalty card.  We shall see what perks are upon me in the future.  Though I found it odd the form asks to write down our password access to sign up for it.  Fine.  Make it kooky.

Stacy, the waitress attending to my table, is super sweet and smiley.  I hope you get her as your waitress.  Was polite and checked on me enough; not overdone.  Even looked cautious about asking cuz I was on my phone... Yelping ppptthh :P

I enjoyed my short rib & white cheddar open faced sandwich.  Challenge was not being able to eat it like a regular sandwich nor like a pizza.  Made use of the interesting fork and knife.  Plus it's cleaner for the face.  I didn't want 'BBQ stick face'.

Really nice interior decor and high ceilings.  Booths are pretty spacious.  Bar area was quiet for a Saturday, but loungy.  It'd be nice to hold a small party here.  Patio seating has umbrellas and palm trees.  An enjoyable space.

Now if Italian music were playing instead, that might make it feel more like another country ;)"}
{"text":"While I do frequent Brio, it truly is hit or miss.  Typically the service is always great but this past week it wasn't even busy and the service was awful to say the least.  

Brio is the perfect spot for a date, celebration, or just a good meal.  They have reasonable prices and the food is always good.  

I typically always get the sliced steak salad.  It's delicious.  I have gotten the lobster bisque a few times and it's overly salty and doesn't have almost any lobster meat in it.  

My friends have gotten several different dishes and always enjoy them.  This past time we had the beef carpaccio which is presented very nicely but it's definitely not the best I've ever had.  

A huge plus to me is Brio's loyalty program.  Almost every time I dine here I have a $10 off on my card which is great!  If you don't bring your card they can easily look it up with your phone number as well!  How convenient!

While i'll definitely be back I think they have a few things to improve their overall customer experience."}
{"text":"I love the food and drinks here but the bar back showed more attentiveness and better customer service than my bartender Jennifer did. She took my drink and food order quickly but never followed up with me. She was working hard to help others but didn't give me the time of the day, for some reason. Customer service is much better at the Town Square location. Not once in an hour and a half did she ask me if I needed anything."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic food and service!  Only a few minutes away from the strip.  What a great value!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Reasonable service on a very busy night. The roasted veggies were good. The lemon chicken was hard and dry, not at all warm and they were stingy with the butter. We had to ask several times for more bread and butter. This was not my typical experience here, the lunch experience was much better."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, only for lunch. The latest time, I had the \"Chipotle Chicken & Bacon Panini\". At first, I wasn't sure about the texture, but the flavors that melded together really worked well together. I think the sandwich would have been better had there been a chicken breast or cutlet, to give it a little more texture, otherwise, very good."}
{"text":"Good food in a nice and relaxing setting.  I come primarily for the Beef Carpacio - a huge platter of very thinly sliced raw beef, drizzled with a delicious aioli, a healthy sized salad in the middle, and big Parmesan crisps.  It's delicious!!!

We've had the pastas, lamb chops, steaks, and other entrees here.  Generally speaking we find them to be a bit salty for our taste, but the portions are healthy and the quality of ingredients is very good.  

Overall a pretty consistent restaurant in a nice setting.  We've been to both the Town Square and Tivoli Village location and have enjoyed them equally."}
{"text":"I haven't been back there in a while and things have gotten a lot worse since my last visit.  Some genius decided that billboard size menus were a good idea.  They are seriously rediculous in size.  Also the food is good, but they raised prices way beyond the quality. They also deliver smaller portions while SIGNIFICANTLY increasing the cost!  This was my last visit unfortunately."}
{"text":"We had a 15 minute wait and I only had 10% of battery left on my iPhone.  The reception counter uses two iPads for reservations and one of the cords was not being used.  I plugged my iPhone in and was going to let it charge.  Nobody noticed and it wasn't even visible, but I felt that I should just mention it to the receptionist.  

She said that I could NOT charge my phone there.  I asked why, and she said that she didn't know whether my phone had any viruses.  I asked how my phone could infect their system thru a charger adaptor?!  She had no answer but said no.  Wtf?!?  I've never had a bar or restaurant refuse to charge my phone.

The food was good as it usually is.  Started with calamari and steak carpaccio.  Entrees of veal milanese, pasta brio, pizza, mac & cheese... All tasty.  

Service was good from our server but they don't have bussers or other servers touching tables.  It took forever to get plates cleared off our table.   We had our empty app plates stacked on top of each other until the end of our meal.  Plus it took forever to get refill on drinks and order more cocktails."}
{"text":"This is our favorite spot to go to for happy hour. Monday through Friday after 9 PM is an amazing happy hour where we always get the burger and the shrimp! Go here and it will not disappoint! 
I have eaten in the dining room many times and have always been very happy and pleased with the food that was prepared.

My wife and I also have our rehearsal dinner her at Brio! I can't say enough good stuff about this place."}
{"text":"My sister, Mom and girlfriends come here for girls night and James K was amazing and attentive! Brio and staff never disappoint, we were spoiled and pampered beyond belief.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great food and pretty darn consistent when it comes to quality and service. It's become one of our monthly spots.

The only reason it's not five stars is the AC is clearly not working well today and it's over 100° outside."}
{"text":"My family and I came to Brio for Mother's day dinner.  We decided to sit outside as the weather was great.  Our waitress came right over took our drink order and returned with a bread basket about 5 mins later.  Please note that at this time we still did not have silverware. After 15 minutes of her returning with our drinks (2 Waters, chocolate milk, Sprite) and no silverware my family decided to leave throughly upset.  I then decided to call the manager to let her know my experience as a 1st time guest.  She immediately apologized and insisted that my family return as we were 5 minutes away.  

Upon arrival we were immediately seated with silverware, drinks and bread.  The experience from this point on was top notch customer service and good food.  My family will return.  Not pictured is the eggplant and shrimp app., Spinach artichoke dip."}
{"text":"Service sucked!! Food is salty and the price is expensive. The three main category of a restaurant! Just did not do it for me. Will not come back ever!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to. or shall I say \"Tuscan\". this place has AWESOME happy hour mon-thurs from 3:00-6:30 and 9-10 pm. and the menu is awesome for happy hour the brio burger is a MUST HAVE!.. also the diavlo pasta is excellent as well.!"}
{"text":"Located in Town Square which is a ways off from the strip but since we were a big party and had kids with us this was what we were looking for.  There's patio seating with mist for the hot Vegas weather although we chose the air condition inside.    Made our reservations on open table for a large party of 17 for my mom's birthday.   We were seated earlier than our reservation and Heather our server was very attentive from the moment we sat down.  

Everything we ordered was amazing from the rib eye steak with a lobster tail on the side, shrimp risotto with a lobster tail, braised short rib, shrimp and lobster fettuccine.   The mac and cheese on the kids menu was not your normal kids Mac and cheese and actually tasted like pasta.  It was a portion for an adult or even three kids!   

Now for dessert, order the caramel marscapone cheesecake.  We ordered the creme brûlée, tiramisu, chocolate torte di chocolate but the cheesecake was my favorite.  

It was my mom's birthday and they even gave her a birthday card.  Very nice touch to already great food and great service."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  Had a soup and salad,  excellent.   But I have to say our waiter was probably the best I have ever had in any restaurant.   I mean ever.   He was probably 30 or so,  but he was phenomenal in all aspects of serving.   Kudos to Brio,  great hire!!!   It is so nice when the food great and the wait staff if equally as great.   Totally enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"I visited Brio for about the 5th time the other day. Once again, a delightful and satisfying dining experience. Whether you're in the mood for a hearty Italian dinner or something light and fresh, Brio does not disappoint! 

The menu was slightly different the last time we went. We had the roasted red pepper bruschetta. The balsamic glaze is amazing. I had the grilled salmon fresca. It was definitely fresh and extremely delicious!"}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for the first time.  A friend took us to lunch at Brio, and since I'd been looking forward to meeting her there the entire trip, and the experience was awesome, they could have served Peanut Butter and Jelly, and I'd probably rave about it.

But Brio serves much better food than that.

The setting is cute, very tall ceilings, Mediterranean style, chic.  The service was friendly and attentive.  The menu had enough of a variety that I had a hard time making up my mind.   Well, that and we gabbed away for 20 minutes before even looking at the menus!

We shared the Brushcetta Sampler and Lobster Bisque appetizers.  (I can't resist Lobster Bisque)  Brio's version was rich and creamy, with good lobster flavor.  I do like more large chunks of lobster meat in my bisque, though.  The bruschetta was a total winner.  There were 4 different types, which our server described as she set down the platter.  I loved the BLT bruschetta.  There was also a Roasted Pepper, and a Beef and Arugula.  They were all fabulous.

Our entrees were:  A chicken and veggie pasta in a light cream sauce (Friend), a Chicken and Applewood Bacon Panini (the Boy), and Scallops with Arugula, Roasted Tomatoes, and Lemon sauce (Me).

Could we be any different?  And yet, each entree was great.  The Scallops weren't overcooked.  (BIG Plus)  The pasta was huge, and the cream sauce wasn't cloying and heavy, and the Boy's panini was crusty, savory goodness.

We shared their dessert sampler (Photo) consisting of miniature cups of selected samples.  Tiramisu, Raspberry Cheesecake, Brownie Sundae, Blackberry Rhubarb Compote, and Apple Caramel Ala Mode.  HOLY YUM!!  (Tiramisu was rated the Best, followed in my opinion by the Blackberry Rhubarb Compote.)

The experience was awesome, the company was fabulous, and the food was great.  I can't wait to visit the one we've got at HOME!  In Denver!   I'm so excited!"}
{"text":"My kids favorite place to eat. My favorite is the 3 medallion fillets with fried tomato, the kids favorite is the pasta Brio. I love sitting on the patio when the weather permits. Desert is awesome here as well. Wait staff is always fast and nice. I love the peach sangria too."}
{"text":"Best part of the meal was the Carpaccio!!! 

The steak was okay and the caesar was okay, by okay I mean much better than I'd get at many places, but not the best. The flatbread crackers they serve before the meal are delicious.

I think the service correctly resembles anything I'd expect from fine dining, there's no rush and a lot of room to breathe and relax. Usually there was a server within eyesight and they were eager to help.

The atmosphere is all that, great for a nice night out or once a year family gathering. 

Overall, worth the trip!"}
{"text":"At Brios grille tonight with my wife and girls. Our server Jessica is great very friendly and quick with the order and did not push us. My meals lately have been ask the server to surprise me just nothing to spicy. She did a great job tonight plus it had bacon. The sauce was silk smooth with good flavor a vodka sauce with stuffed ricotta. The three other meals were good and big servings. We sat outside since they have the misters. Inside has great A/C and ambience was inviting but a lot of people so a little loud. Plus tiramisu was great."}
{"text":"We usually come to Brio for dinner and drinks, and this time we decided to stop in for brunch (and drinks, haha!)... so glad we did!

I ordered Berries & Cream French Toast and he ordered Eggs Oscar... um, well, I ended up eating half of his plate. 

The waiter was so friendly and incredibly patient with me, as I could not make up my mind and was ready to order three or four different items. He recommended his favorite and also whipped up fabulous for-the-morning drinks.

I also have to mention valet service, as this is usually a hit or miss for most restaurants. Brio's valet obviously figured it out because they're fast, friendly and go off of tips... with an ATM machine nearby if you don't have cash.

Definitely impressed with brunch selection and dinner was always five stars!"}
{"text":"The dining room at Brio is warm, casual, and comfortable.  Service is quick and friendly.  Our party sampled several dishes:
Pasta Brio - very good and perfectly al dente
Lasagna - solid but not phenomenal.  Huge portion.
Bread basket - delicious rustic loaf and crackers
Steak carpaccio - excellent.  Must try!  The sauce and salad that accompany it are great.
Florentine steak - juicy with a crisp seared exterior.  Excellent!
Shrimp Mediterranean - here's where the experience fell short.  The shrimp was ok and had a lot of kick.  The orzo and farro that came with it was extremely oversalted.  It's as if they put a canister of salt into the cooking water.
Dessert trio- very good.  The cheesecake was my favorite.
I'd definitely come back.  Just skip the Shrimp Mediterranean."}
{"text":"My family eat here pretty frequently. Every time we come here, we have amazing service. I really liked our waiter tonight, Frank. He continuously checked up on us to make sure we were taken care of. He served our dishes with a smile. The shrimp and eggplant appetizer and mascarpone cheesecake are the best!"}
{"text":"Saturday, Brunch. Outside. Mojitos. Perfect. Service was great. Not too pushy to get us out of there. (they were busy) I hadn't tried this part of the the menu before and wasn't excited about it but the omlet was just fine. I usually eat the crab cakes at the location at Town Cener. But, the service there has gone downhill. It's like McDonalds Ronalds playland when you sit outside there. It sucks. You try and have a great meal and surrounding you is kids crying and running. Yes, I said running, around you. Nobody seems to notice ? I told the server I wouldn't be back since that was the 2nd dinner I had that experience. Apparently is not just a family restaurant,it's kiddie land....So, stick to the location on Rampart, so far, they haven't gone downhill..."}
{"text":"This is one of my usual happy hour spots when I need a good drink and some good food. Came tonight expecting their $2.95 small bites menu and found a brand new HH menu :/ the prices are a bit higher but some portions are bigger than before. I ordered two strawberry mojitos (Yum! One of the few places that carries Cruzan Strawberry Rum) and toasted Ravioli. The BF got a Keylime mojito, a Manhattan (aka Bourbon on the rocks, or that's how it tasted lol) and the Brio Burger. Food and drinks were great and service was quick since we sat at the bar. Only downside was the higher prices - our bill came out to around $36 for happy hour - for two apps and four drinks....might not seem so bad, but I think we were just used to the old menu and prices. Oh well that's Scottsdale for you! :)"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while so went back to renew acquaintance on a Thursday night. Dinner for three of us was excellent - fish and angel hair pasta for dad and son, chicken limone for mom. All were very good and just as expected. Service was fine with no slip-ups."}
{"text":"The food here is good, upper end for a chain. The steak I had was done perfectly -and the pasta vodka with ricotta filled pockets was very nice.

Now the reason for the low score...

The place was single large room packed with people. Not great if you want a semi-relaxing meal... and when I'm spending a decent coin I don't want to be crammed into a massive room with a few hundred people and hear everyone's conversation from all over the place.

We had coupons so the price was fine but at regular price, for the same $, I'd go to several other places with better food and a better, relaxing and more quiet, atmosphere."}
{"text":"Oh my, lobster bisque! Bring me 3 bowls please, and 2 loaves of that bread too. Everything here is delish, great outdoor seating and nice bar area for colder days. Highly approve!"}
{"text":"Grilled Salmon Fresca!

I'm on a very strict diet preparing for vacation and this dish is OUTSTANDING!!! Get all dressing and feta on side."}
{"text":"We visited Brio Tuscan Grille about 20 times. I always enjoy the steak salad, lamb chops and my 6 year old grandson  loves the lobster bisque soup."}
{"text":"Never fails! Anything and everything is delicious! One of my faves, is the Gorgonzola filet mignon... Always cooked perfectly and try their Bellini!!!  And it never hurts that the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour. Out door seating is awesome, fast service and great food. The flat bread pizzas are great, but my favorite was the beef carpaccio. Only had the apps, but they were tasty enough we didn't need to order entres."}
{"text":"I really like this Brio location.

The high ceilings give it a large feel and the food is always good."}
{"text":"This is an awesome happy hour spot.  Food and service were good.  Sit out on the patio.  Order flat bread and eggplant fries, yummy!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service.  My son was especially delighted that his burger extended all the way to the edge of the bun :-)"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I have mixed reviews about this place. There are times when I have been here where the food and the service is just not up to par and the last time I was here, was not any different. 
   I brought my sister here for her birthday dinner. We decided to sit outside since they had the misters outside turned on to cool things down a bit. We didn't order any appetizers but we decided to get drinks. The peach and raspberry sangria with moscato in it not only looked good but it was very refreshing. My sister ordered the shrimp risotto and I ordered the angel hair pasta with pesto sauce and shrimp. The risotto dish seemed fine, each dish had jumbo shrimp in it but my pasta was dry and had little to no sauce on it.  
   In the middle of our dinner, the restaurant decided to turn the misters off, even though it was only 7:30. At that point, it just got too hot and uncomfortable to even enjoy our meal. We were just ready to go but our waiter seemed really busy so we just sat out there in heat waiting for him to come by with our check. 
    May be next time I come here, I will sit inside so I am not melting in the heat and can try to enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"Food is really good,  like always. ..  We come here often but tonight is just an exemption.  We brought our niece from Italy for her birthday and to impress here of our food and service.  Like I said, food is phenomenal but absolutely no service at all.  We have to ask three different servers just for a bread.  Can't get no water and our main server had to ask the birthday girl if she wants a surprise dessert.   I thought its called a surprise."}
{"text":"My sister and I had passed this restaurant on the way to my job and decided to try it out. I had the calamari fritto and she had the salmon. Both were terrific with just the right portions and seasonings! I would strongly suggest eating here as it is well worth the try."}
{"text":"Boy did we stumble upon a gem.
One of the best all around meals we have had in a while.
Started with a great Peach Bellini, then we split a very nice chopped salad. Our waiter, Cody( he was excellent) suggested the Lasagna and he was right on, it was one of the best ever. I ordered the braised short ribs, and again, they were outstanding. Included mashed potatoes, roasted carrots and mushrooms, again they were super.
If you are in The Kierland area of Phoenix, this place is a must. 
Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night for Valentine's Day and ate from the Valentine's Day prix fixe menu. I had the lobster bisque and the crab stuffed shrimp and lobster tail. Both of these items were DELICIOUS. My husband had a cesaer salad, the filet mignon, and the fingerling potatoes. His steak was devoured pretty quick, but I did get a chance to try his potatoes and they were great. For dessert, we got the dolcini trio consisting of the caramel marscapone cheesecake, creme brûlée, and a seasonal banana pudding. The pudding was my favorite-so good! Our server was Jenny and despite the fact that they were extremely busy and she was hustling, she never let our drinks get low and she was very attentive. We will definitely be back in the future. We had a great experience!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've tried both locations on town now (Town Square & Tivoli) and I've had 2 great dining experiences.

Very cheap happy hour at the bar from 3:30pm-6:30pm and reverse happy hour from 9pm-close where all the food on the happy hour menu is only $2.95! The only drink specials I saw were $5 martinis on Thursday's.

Service was friendly and very welcoming and the food at is amazing. I recommend the Pasta Brio, which is rigatoni with a seared mushroom and peppers sauce, the Pasta alla Vodka, homemade pasta filled with ricotta, and the seared shrimp risotto is also delicious. Portions are good for the price and the menu has a lot of choices.

This is my favorite Italian restaurant in town. Everything is a hit in this place and if you haven't tried it yet you should get in your car and drive down there right now."}
{"text":"Average at best.  We went during brunch on a Sunday and stood at the front counter for a good five minutes without a greeting.  Then when we finally got seated and it took another 10 minutes just to be greeted by a waitress.  From there we get our menus and complimentary bread and wait another 15 minutes for our waitress to deliver our drinks and take our orders.  

Next, we were not given silverware or plates for our bread.  And unbelievably our waitress could not be found and was not even in eyesight until 15 minutes later.  So we ended up eating bread off of our menus (which she for some reason didn't even take away once we ordered) with no napkin or anything.  

The utensils finally came along with our meals.  The food itself, an omelette and brunch quinoa salad, was just alright.  The portion size was good but the eggs themselves didn't seem anything too great and probably not worth $11 each.  I guess you're paying for the ambiance of Tivoli in that case.  Buta gain the waitress struggled when we asked for some extra condiments and it took her so long to track some down that we were halfway done with our meals by then.

We overheard the waitress talking to another party about getting some food comped since her service was so bad for them, so I'm guessing we just got stuck with a new waitress who was having a bad day or something; but still, it gave the restaurant a very poor first impression from my point of view from her service.  

I hear the Happy Hour is worthwhile so I could be back for a drink or two in the future, but it's not likely I'll ever come back for a full meal, especially at the Tivoli location."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was quick.  The waiter checked in periodically but also gave us time to sit and talk.  Great evening, great food, great friends."}
{"text":"I had noticed  this place and had been meaning for awhile to try it but forgot about it until a week ago when I was at the San Tan mall shopping. I told my hubby we would try soon to go there and it happened to be today. OMG I can't believe I did not try this place sooner! Food was absolutely fabulous! It is even close to us YEAH!We loved the decor and the staff were very nice and accomodating. We had the spicy shrimp and eggplant app to start. Heaven on a plate! In fact, our server told us in the future we could ask to have this served with pasta and asparagus as a main dish in the future. (I guess this is popular among staff) The sauce is wonderful. I so wish I could get the recipe. Eggplant was cooked crispy to pefection.Topped with a single perfectly cooked shrimp. The sauce is so Yummy! Creamy, hint of wine.Has a bit of spice to it. Loved the bit of heat that lingers in the back or your throat.We lapped up every last drop of the sauce with extra bread she brought us. Today we brought our two kids. I had a hard time deciding what to order so it was good we were all together to sample each others dishes. I had the mediterranean pasta.Wonderful. Plenty of garlic. Feta cheese, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes spinach, pinenuts and plenty of basil. Nice and light. Daughter had the pasta with vodka sauce,Her pasta was perfect. Shaped like a little sache. Perfect texture with the wonderful Vodka sauce. Son had braised beef fettucini.The beef portions were like butter. If I had no teeth I still would have been okay. Lastly hubby had the mushroom ravioli. Creamy and rich, but not overly rich. Nice sprinkling of panko on top. I loved that the ravioli was not overloaded with cheese. I like tasting the mushroom.All were excellent. It would be really hard to decide which I liked best. Every dish was diffferent and full of favor.Prob would be difficult going there in the future without the 4 of us  if I had to decide on one dish. I am  almost embarrased to say we all cleaned our plates. However,don't be scared for my waist line, this was our only meal for the day. We ate our days worth :) Dont worry kids did eat light dinner) We decided we could not leave without trying dessert. We ordered the creme brulee trio and a single serv of cheesecake. The small servings are perfect. Creme brulee was light and lovely. Dinner with tip for 4 was$104.Not something we could do every week however when I go out I want it to be worth my money.Would definitely be a great place to take a date or to impress family or business clients.  We will definitely go back. My birthday is in a few weeks ;)"}
{"text":"Because its in Crocker Park, I've eaten at this restaurant several times, due to the convenience. 

The service is terrible. Four girls at the hostess stand that just stare at you and take 5 minutes to figure out if you can get a seat or have to wait. The person taking you  to the table rarely speaks or makes eye contact.

The food can hardly be called \"authentic\". Very bland and over priced. Same with the drinks. And if you forgo alcohol for water the server is very slow to refill the water. 

The positive thing about this place is the location and the nice patio."}
{"text":"The desserts. Delicious. The setting was upscale casual, food was good, nothing superb, but overall a good place to enjoy a nice dinnner"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Saturday and although it was pretty busy, we were seated right away. I ordered one of the lunch specials that includes a soup/salad with an entree. I got the wedge salad and the portion was HUGE and it was delicious. Really a meal itself. I also ordered a simple tomato basil pasta that was perfect. My mom ordered the flatbread and it was also delicious. I was really impressed with the quality for the price. Also, the children's entrees are HUGE. More than enough for an adult. Great dining experience."}
{"text":"I like the vibes of Italy @Brio, the food is great especially the happy hour @the bar! Check it out!"}
{"text":"My server julio and the food was awesome!! I will comeback for sure, the place have a nice location and friendly stuff, prices are very affordable, i will recommend this place to all  my friends"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with a friend.  I was impressed.  The wait to officially sit outside was like 45 minutes so we opted to go to the outside bar and found a table there.  There was waiter service.  We had a few cocktails and ordered an appetizer and a salad to share.  It was just what I had hoped for for a girls night out.  The cocktails were interesting and very tasty.  The food was good, and what you would expect from a place like this.  The outdoor patio was nice and the service was good.  We implied that we wanted to just drink and be mellow and he left us alone for the most part.  

I would go again, very nice place."}
{"text":"Yes it's a franchise and blah for a unique culinary experience but man, they always deliver a good meal, good service and always plenty of seating in a lovely restaurant setting. So for a mega restaurant it's great. Plenty of Kids options, family friendly, decent prices and the food pleases everyone. If you want farm to table, well, this ain't the place. But I love their huge plate of beef carpaccio, calamari, flatbreads and love their selection of small plates."}
{"text":"The Lobster Bisque at Brio is amazing! I always order the soup every time I dine in. I also order the Salmon Fresco which is also good, however, the Lobster Bisque is truly amazing in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm not an Italian food fan, but I simply come here for their Beef Carpaccio. Its SO deng good! Their servers are very knowledgable of the food they offer on their menus, and we always get A-Plus service when we come here."}
{"text":"For now my review is five stars. However! I did not have a full dining experience. Me and two coworkers went here after work on Friday around 1:30pm and we just had sangria and appetizers. We sat outside in Town Square because the weather was beautiful. We ordered the white peach sangria, which was excellent beyond belief. I'm typically a red sangria person because the others are too sweet but this was just perfect. I ordered the steak bruschetta. My goodness. It was so awesome. It had a touch of Gorgonzola cheese on it but it wasn't too strong as it sometimes can be. It had arugula and Parmesan. The steak was so tender and flavorful. I was legitimately impressed. 

Our service was very good and attentive as well and she split the check three ways for us which I appreciated...considering this is sometimes a painful task. 

I was glad we sat outside where is was quiet and shaded. I saw a glimpse of the inside and it just wasn't inviting. It looked dark and loud."}
{"text":"Happy hour at Brio is awesome.  The ambiance is amazing, and the food is extremely inexpensive, while being decent portions and absolutely scrumptious.  If you're curious, my personal favorite is the spicy shrimp and eggplant.

Aside from regular happy hour attendance, I've also hosted a special event on the covered North patio.  Everything was absolutely perfect, from the decor to the personable and knowledgeable servers.

It rained and was a bit cold, but the heaters more than made up for it.  Additionally, the rain made it so that or event was significantly under-attended relative to our predictions.  The management staff was extremely gracious.

Whether it's for an informal happy hour or an important exclusive event, Brio is a great choice!"}
{"text":"For starters, the place is pretty..  But!!!!!  The food was terrible.  The Cesar salad had almost no dressing.  I ordered the lobster, shrimp fettuccine and the noodles where under cooked.  No not aldente!!!  Under cooked and sticky..  the lobster on the other hand was OVER COOKED.  Cooked till it was tuff with no seasoning.  The mushrooms where almost raw and the shrimps had no flavor either.  As for the service.... well the service wasn't very good either!!!  And where my lemon for my Fricken water??????"}
{"text":"A favorite for happy hour.   Great food, service, atmosphere and cost.   Love the energy here."}
{"text":"I've only been to Brio for special occasions. The first was my 21st birthday, the next was the night I got engaged, and the last was for dinner after my husband and I had our civil wedding.

Brio does special occasions like a buncha pros. On my birthday, they made me feel so special, with a free dessert that said \"Happy 21st\" and a coupon for a free appetizer on my next visit. We didn't get engaged until after dinner, so they didn't do anything for that, lol. But it was still a really romantic date (as far as I knew at the time!) Then, for our wedding dinner, it was me and my husband and our parents, and they really went out of our way to make it a celebration. The waiter was so friendly, and we got an entire dessert sampler complimentary. My husband was wearing his dress blues since we came straight from the wedding, and the staff was thanking him for his service, which we thought was cute.

Bottom line, I love this restaurant. Eat here!

Foods I love: the spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer is to die for, the caesar salad isn't too anchovy-tasting, and the mushroom ravioli is my favorite dish. :)"}
{"text":"Happy hour and a martini is always good here.... And at night or in the winter they have a fire pit...!"}
{"text":"wretched and overpriced. i'm embarrassed to say we even ate here - but it was here or cheesecake factory so i figured, italian! how bad could it be. the answer? VERY. if you consider yourself a person even remotely well versed in good food - avoid avoid avoid."}
{"text":"Tasty, well sized meals. Pricing was a bit overpriced but it was a very lovely atmosphere."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I were around San Tan village so we decided to try this place out. The restaurant reminds me of carrabas and Olive Garden put together. We started off with some calamari which were really good. It came with a marinara and spicy tarter sauce. I liked how they had some fried peppers with the calamari. Then my boyfriend ordered the lobster and shrimp fettuccini  and I got the shrimp Mediterranean. Overall great food, great service and atmosphere"}
{"text":"been here many times and service always good.  Food amazing.  love the ravioli and the medalions.  atmosphere always spot on.  dessert of the warm chocolate cake yummy  we add an extra scoop of ice cream and devour away!!  Love this place"}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food was meh.  We had the bruchetta as an appetizer.  The flavors did not blend well at all.  They SHOULD be considering it's an italian resturant.  We ordered the shrimp lobster fettuccini to share.  Well, there was only one tiny piece of lobster. One piece of lobster does not make it a shrimp, lobster fettuccini, so of course my dinner partner was sweet enough to give me the one tiny piece.  The sauce was just okay.  Could have used more flavor.  On a plus side, the bread is pretty awesome.  Too bad it looks so pretty on the inside.  Won't be enough to bring me back unless there are no other options and it's extremely convenient."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, pleasant and attentive hostess and wait staff.  Had the Pesto Pasta, enjoyed!  Angel hair compliments the spinach, red pepper and chicken.  Very light! We parked in the garage, but valet is available.  P.S. watch the parking meters - take quarters with you, and limited to 2 hours."}
{"text":"My experience with this restaurant was not as I expected. The feeling I got as soon as I walked in and asked a simple question was as they were doing customers a favor by letting you in. 

I choose to ignore their lack of courtesy, asked for patio which faced towards Victoria Secrets and behind their bar, they said it was closed although there we people sitting there. Then they took us instead to another outsite section which basically had no one sitting in the area.

I simply left this restaurant and inmediately ran into California Kitchen, which had a much better attitute towards customers.

Maybe some badic manners trainning would help this hostes at the entrance representing Brio."}
{"text":"I really hate that I have to give Brio 2 stars but based on my visit this weekend I have no choice. I have been here a few times years ago and the experience was much better but Saturday was a disappointment. The wait for a server to say hello was not acceptable. Being that this is the first impression and setting the stage for our visit I say it was a fail. The wait to get drinks and bread basket was longer then it should have been as well. The food.... Oh how I was excited for the food to come but wow was I disappointed. I got the Mediterranean Shrimp dish that cost $16.25 and it was so bland. The shrimp were dry and rubbery, the  veggies on the plate were fine as was the orzo pasta but this dish needed some sauce or a heck of a lot more of the vinaigrette that was just in spots on the sides of the plate. Overall very boring dish for way too much money. My son liked his chicken fingers but we told the server he wanted ranch. At that time the server should have told us that Brio doesn't have ranch but rather uses a Parmesan dressing.  He didn't tell us this and my kid was rather disappointed when he dipped his chicken in it. My point here is the lack of communication from the server. I felt like we were just a nuisance to our server. When we left the restaurants was up front and didn't even say goodbye. This experience was so disappointing for us. I hope no one else has this experience."}
{"text":"They have a really great brunch on the weekends!

I had some crab stuffed crepes that the bartender recommended and they were better than I could have hoped for - yum!  I also tried a few signature cocktails and they were just as good.  It's nice to see something different on a drink menu.

Service was excellent, very clean, nice decor.  All around a great dinning experience."}
{"text":"I joined my mom, sister and grandma here for a ladies lunch. The inside is beautiful and the patio looked cute. One thing I really like about Brio is they do brunch Saturday and Sunday all the way till 3:00. (Some of us are not earlier risers on the weekend and like to do our brunching later in the  day.)
Although, on this trip I was feeling more lunch so I had one of their lunch platters which came with lasagna and your choice of salad. I had the chopped salad which was very fresh and yummy. The lasagna may not be authentic but you could tell it was made with real ingredients, not thawed and cooked like at the OG. 

The other ladies at the table tried the risotto which received several mmms and ahhhs. They have two different kinds of risotto scallop and shrimp or the chicken with sweet potato. I tried both and they were fantastic. My grandma had a gin martini and she is VERY particular about her cocktails and she said it was made perfectly to her specifications. 

I would come back here for brunch or lunch but I do think the dinner prices were really high. Go in the daytime because you get dinner sized portions but at reduced lunch prices."}
{"text":"Salmon salad for the win! No cheese and gluten free, this fresh salmon salad is phenomenal. Paired with a good dry white wine it's perfection! 

Carpaccio and shrimp and eggplant apps are amazing as well, mine and Andy's go tos! 

You also can't beat the happy hour. Everyday I believe 4-6:30pm. Get there around 4 and you should be golden!"}
{"text":"I love this place atmosphere.
The food was delicious  and service was quick. Also one of my friend can't  eat gluten but they had gluten-free food.
Definitely we will come back."}
{"text":"The food is great but to me the best was the service! Joey was our waiter and he is the best! He was very quick and he knew what to help us out with. He gave the best suggestions and he was not wrong! I loved Ravioli Di Bello!! SO GOOD!! My dad loved the Lobster and Shrimp fettuccine and my mother had the grilled salmon fresca and was delighted. She said Joey was one of the best waiters and when we go back to vegas we are going in his section ONLY!!! Go to Brio and go for Joey!!"}
{"text":"My uncle took my mom & I to this restaurant over the weekend to celebrate her birthday & my graduation. I'm usually pretty skeptical with Italian food in general because I'm allergic to gluten and can't eat much...but I figured I could find something to  suit me.

Loved it here. It's located in this high end outdoor mall (which we didn't see too much of, thanks to scorching Vegas weather...) and the restaurant itself is beautiful. I loved the building with it's high ceilings & open space. I made me feel like I was dining in a castle :)

It was still a little early for dinner (about 5:30), so we were seated right away, although we had no reservations. We were given a bread basket with some flatbread crisps to munch on while we were looking over the menu. I didn't try any of it, but my mom & uncle said the bread was yummy. I ordered the sweet potato & chicken risotto and a  salad, my mom ordered a flatbread pizza and my uncle got the crab cakes. We all decided to share the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer.

The salad was amazing. Best cesar salad I've had, and I've had quite a few in my time. The dressing wasn't too salty...and the tanginess was perfection. The dip was a bit too salty for me...but I tasted a little bit of the parmesan crisps that come with it & they were great. 

When my food arrived it was very pretty :) The risotto wasn't gummy (which is usually the case) and the flavor was great...but I was a little weirded out because they used dark meat chicken. There were ligaments still attached, like they used a chicken leg instead of a chicken breast. Not that there's anything wrong with that, I am just used to seeing white meat used, as opposed to dark. It tasted fine, tho...I took it all in stride.

I ordered a creme brulee for dessert and it was pretty good. Not the best, but definitely up there.

All in all, the ambiance was nice & the waitress was very friendly. We had a good time here. I'm don't usually visit lavish restaurants when we're in Vegas, but I'd definitely give this place a try again. I'd love to try some pasta here, but I really would hate to land myself in the hospital..."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the great reviews on Yelp. We had bad service and very bad food tonight. The waitress was rude, the food was cold and very bland."}
{"text":"That's is my to go place! I love to chill on their patio during summer. I usually go during happy hour, I recommend you guys to take the black pepper shrimp with black pepper sauce.. if you want a refreshing cocktail during summer, you can't go wrong with their white peach sangria!! Oh!! And I almost forgot the lava cake who's excellent :)"}
{"text":"So, I'm not big on chain restaurants, but my experience with Brio over the years has allowed it to remain on our list of family-friendly options.  My most recent visit did nothing to dispel that notion.

Thursday night dinner...place was relatively busy.  Fortunately, I was seated right away.  The reason for the fourth star is our server, Kristen.  She was very friendly, and generally had our food and drinks to our table in short order.  She was also very nice to our kids, a touch that means a lot to the parents of three kids in their single-digits.

The food is not bad.  My lasagna tasted the same as my last visit (very filling), although a bit pricy at $18.  My biggest complaint (besides the price bump) was the calamari appetizer.  The portion was much smaller than we remembered, and for $11, they shorted us a bit.  We were willing to overlook it because everything else was okay, but it didn't start our meal off on the greatest foot.

There are a few better options for Italian in the area (which I haven't tried yet), but Brio is perfect for families."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here today and the food was amazing!! Service is great and the outdoor sitting area was refreshing! It is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Vigor's of Tuscany.....and grill...eh! Eh! ....oooh

Lazy Sunday after missing the movies since I didn't want to stand in line. Attended this place since I heard great things about their HH -- I had no Vigor in me this day so HH sounded awesome.  However, no HH on Sunday!  Errrr -- well I was not dissatisfied.  We order some drinks and appetizers.  I had the Raspberry Mojito -- definitely cooled me down!  We ordered some Calamari and guess what the star of the dish wasn't even the Calamari -- the fried peppercini peppers did it for us.  So we had a special request for just that and guess what -- they obliged - Thumbs Up!  My friend ordered the Steak Bruschetta's and I don't remember her eating it....just saw the empty board haha! 

We said outside on the bar patio with the misters while people watching.  Service was great and the drinks flowed.  What can I say; I'm coming back for HH next time. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have to say the food was a letdown this visit.  I think I always remember Brio to be better than it typically is.  My husband ordered the Vodka pasta, it was thick and rich.  It was very good however the pasta and chicken seemed dry.

I ordered the scallop risotto and although the risotto was very tasty the scallop I tried was both undercooked and very gritty and sandy.  I told our server who was horrified and quickly allowed me to choose something else from the menu. To be honest I'd lost my appetite and just chose a wedge salad. Our server offered us the warm chocolate cake and it was the best part of our meal.  Rich and indulgent.  The sourdough bread was also amazing.

You may ask why I'm still giving Brio 4 stars.  The food was a 2 and our awesome server Alex offered us 5 star service.  He was dynamite!  Thank you Alex!"}
{"text":"This was a terrible lunch experience. We sat out on the patio by the door. The waiter wouldn't even come all the way outside he would just stick his head out and ask if we needed anything. The food was awful and if the waiter had actually come out we would have told him. Or possibly a big clue would have been no one finishing their food! Awful place, not ever going back!"}
{"text":"Very nice ambiance and the staff was friendly and attentive.  The food was mixed. Some of the dishes were very good (especially some of the appetizers) but my entree was very disappointing (had the shrimp/lobster fettuccine). As a result I have to give it 3 stars but it is the type of place that I would be willing to try again while ordering something different."}
{"text":"A good family restaurant for a night in Crocker Park. Even though its a chain, it doesn't taste or feel like one. This location is a little less well lit relative to other locations but the food is equally as good and the outdoor patio is very nice on a summer evening."}
{"text":"Great server! She was attentive but not overbearing as we had to wait almost an hour for another person in our party to show up. When our food arrived, my food was cold and it was the special of the day. The other two people with me said their food was very good, especially the port chop. Being in Vegas, the atmosphere is wonderful, especially if you sit out on the patio which stretches around 1/2 the large building."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere especially on the patio on a warm, breezy, day in Vegas. Our waitress was great! She was new but very friendly, efficient and attentive even though we waited almost an hour for the 3rd person in our party. I ordered the special on the menu insert, salmon. The flavor was good, but unfortunately, it was on the cold side. The others in my party were very happy with the steak and pork chop."}
{"text":"Meh. As my fellow Yelper said to me a few days after we ate here: \"No Brio review, I'm shocked!\" 

I didn't jump on writing this review because I was pretty underwhelmed by the experience. The ambience sucks, the service wasn't very good and the food was totally average. 

My cursor is blinking at me and I still don't know what else to say about my time spent here. 

Ambience- looks like an Italian cheesecake factory. Why are the collumns so huge?!

Service- the bartender kept interrupting us to take our order when we STILL weren't ready. Jeez, does it look like I've moved my menu in the 53 seconds it's been since the last time you checked? And then disappeared when we were finally ready. 

Food- 
-carpaccio, not bad but does it seriously need to be that huge? The two of us didn't even come close to finishing it. 
-Mediterranean pasta, pretty much the only one without a cream sauce on the whole menu. They split it for us which was nice and it tasted all right with mushrooms and chicken and stuff. 
-tiramisu came out frozen. They were super apologetic and didn't charge us for the replacement, but it was still awkward. They obviously just heated up a piece which made it melty and just not that great.

So yeah, that's that."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance inside and outside but just OK beyond that.  The service was good but there ends the pros. The beer selection was minimal (and no IPAs) and the food OK but nothing special.  When I think I could have made a much better meal at home I realize why we don't eat out that often.  The salad was Iceberg lettuce which to me is a turn off = no nutritional value and no flavor.  In summary, our first and last visit here."}
{"text":"Beyond 5 stars!!! The service was amazing. The food was spectacular. If the pumpkin ravioli is on the Specials menu I highly recommend it. It was the most decadent dish I have ever had. It has an Amaretto cream sauce that is so unique. I would order it again for sure. It was so hard to pick what to order, everything sounded so good. And the calamari appetizer.....oh they fry peperoncinis in with it. It was a really good combo. Highly recommend this restaurant. Pricey but worth it. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Thank you Brio Tuscon Grille for great lunch earlier this week.
Thank you fellow yelpers for your check in and reviews.  When fellow yelpers check in, I do look up and if it is something interesting for me, I book mark. I do enjoy reading reviews online, otherwise I would not have been able to experience so many yummy dishes. This place is no exception, when one of the yelpers checked in, it sounded so interesting, I had to try for myself.

We arrived here around noon, and it was about 80% full when we got there.

I glanced at the menu and almost decided on salmon when my friend kindly pointed out on today's special menu.   My eyes were glued to the pumpkin ravioli from the moment I saw the today's special menu.

I must tell you, if you haven't tried the pumpkin ravioli, try once. You will not regret it. First of all, it's fall, it's pumpkin season. Second, pumpkin is so good for you with vitamins.  Ravioli is served with many vegetables to make this dish more healthy.  And best of all, this was the best pumpkin ravioli I've ever had. I especially like the sauce used in the ravioli, nicely complemented the pasta dish.

Don't forget to check in on yelp for free appetizer with two orders of entrees. We ordered tomato salad (Caprese salad). I thought they used really good quality of mozzarella cheese, I enjoyed the salad very much.

For desert, I ordered mini-size tiramisu. It was so moist, I ate this small desert very quickly. I had to go jogging for 60 mins that night to burn all the calories from my desert, but it was so worth it.

Coffee was very good as well. I like when restaurant invest in good coffee, saves me a trip to coffee shop after my meal.

Service was very good as well. They were busy but they kept moving very efficiently.

Looks like I found my new favorite place to eat, I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Went there last night and had a better experience than prior.   We started off with the Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip with parmesan flatbread.   YUMMMM!   Not too much of a garlic taste to feel as thought I would have garlic breath but just enough to taste it.   Correct combination of spinach and artichoke hearts.   Chunks of artichoke that I appreciated.  My companion had the Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccine  and I had the Shrimp Mediterranean.   Both dishes were delish!    I had the shrimp dish prior and enjoyed it; therefore, I had it again since I had basically pigged out on the warm sour dough bread and flatbread and the dip and parmesan flatbread.   The fettuccine had the smaller shrimp than mine and lobster and the correct combination of cheeses and spices.   I would order that next time.

Our server was Jonathan in the bar since we would have had to wait for seating in the dining room and there were plenty of booths and tables in the bar with no wait.   Jonathan was very competent, efficient and friendly.

I definitely will be going back, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"The service here is hit or miss. More misses than hits, unfortunately. I love their steak salad but it took them 3 times to get it right. There have been times where we were completely ignored. No water or bread for 30 minutes.
I just don't know what's going on here:("}
{"text":"AMAZING!! My husband and I were doing some holiday shopping at the San Tan Village and decided to try out Brio for dinner. We were greeted by a very friendly hostess and were told that it would be a short wait. We were seated within 10 minutes and were given a very comfy booth. The wine list was small but had some great options. Our server was very friendly, knowledgable and answered all of our questions on the menu. I had the salmon and my husband had the pork chops. My salmon was cooked perfectly and was served on top of a breaded tomato. It was to die for! For dessert we had a mini tiramisu and a mini cheesecake. Both were very tasty and the perfect size to finish off the meal. The service was excellent. They don't rush you or forget about you. My only complaint is that it is too far away! We will definatly make the drive again just to vist them."}
{"text":"I decided to take my wife out on a week night and it was totally worth it. The service was excellent and our server Viviane made the night wonderful. Her timing on everything was perfect as we never had to ask for anything. We love apps and found the steak bruschetta and margherita flatbread quite tasty. My wife tried the shrimp risotto and lobster tail and I the pesce piccata and they were both delicious!! \"We share\" I would totally recommend going to Brio if you are in the Scottsdale Quarter's area. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Brio is definitely my favorite chain Italian spot in town! If you didn't know you would have no idea it's a chain joint. Everything is solid, great portion, and tasty just a bit over priced in my opinion but well worth the visit during happy hour. I love their bruschetta so I got the bruschetta sampler which was really tasty and a great variation of flavors. Their bread assortment is quality as well as their soups and salads. I ordered the chicken pesto pasta had tons of flavor however they went a little light on the pesto for my liking so if you really like pesto make sure you ask for extra! My friend got the crab cake entree which looked amazing I tried a piece and I will probably order it next time I visit. All in all a solid Italian restaurant that I would recommend if you are in the town square area!"}
{"text":"Good happy hour. Our server was friendly and very good. One of the other servers that helped bring out our order gave us a little attitude (brunette) when we asked for another setting. Bartender seemed a little slow....took a long time to get our drinks. But even with that, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Me and a friend  were shopping in town square. Decided to stop here for lunch. As we walked in I was impressed the restaurant is nice and classy. We were greeted right away and seated immediately, since they were not that busy. The ambiance of this place is great it's very relaxing. They have a variety of choices on the menu to choose from and the price is very reasonable. My friend had the pasta brio with Alfredo sauce. I  went more traditional and ordered the Americana burger. Both dishes were very good. Now as for the service it was very good our waitress always made sure we were taken care of. I really enjoyed this restaurant and suggest you give it a try."}
{"text":"Four stars although my experience was up at the bar and we were entertaining each other talking like school girls. Strawberry chicken salad was big and tasty. Calamari good. Bread yum m, pasta dish my friend ate but I didn't pay attention too. Good price drinks and glasses of wine."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, firstly on Dinner time and recently for Happy Hour. (pictures) Food was spot on both times. Ambiance is beautiful, setting (plates and utensils) was clean - no spots no nothing, cheerful and knowledgeable servers. It was a great experience from having a family dinner or a date to a kick back after work - this is the place to be. Their happy hour prices are unbeatable: quality of the food was outstanding hand in hand with their low prices. I have yet to give another star when I come back (most definitely will soon). So look out for my update. I'll probably try their lunch time and see if everything is consistent. So far so good though. Worth the drive from Chandler. I left the restaurant happy and satisfied. :)"}
{"text":"Food was great, but service was horrible! Got seated outside with our waitress Robin, should've known how the service was going to be when it took close to 10 minutes just to get our waters. Chicken limon was EXTRAORDINARY! I ordered the salmon freshca no red peppers and what do I get red peppers all I got from Robin was oh they don't seem to be listening tonight. Had a bite of my friends chicken limon and I wished I had ordered that mmmm so yummy. Then we ask her for a dessert menu and again a 10 minute wait only for her to come back and apologize that she's taking long. Then another 10 min wait to get our dessert, creme brûlée is fantastic. Overall food was GREAT, however the service made my first time here not so pleasant."}
{"text":"So these stars are for the way my complaint was handled. After waiting three days for someone to contact me I decided to call and ask to speak to a GM, he was not in and I spoke to Adam who is a manager. Adam refunded my charge, invited me back with a guest for a meal, but MOST IMPORTANT,  listened to me and apologized for my experience last weekend. I will come back and give this Brio another try. This is how my situation should have been handled that night. This is customer service."}
{"text":"$4 happy hour apps and a $5 Aperol spritzer? Ain't mad at ya.

Maybe the magic is a bit built up, hailing from a state with zero drink specials (thanks Blue Laws!), but stepping out of a blustery, sleet-driven Friday in to the warm, fabricated hearth of a Brio set the stage for success.

Cheap food that's just cheap food? Hardly. We dabble in a spinach dip, sliders, ravioli caprese, crispy shrimp and a sausage & pepper flatbread, all at the paltry price of 400 pennies each. Keep your expectations in check, and the shrimp and caprese will pleasantly surprise you.

The atmosphere is a kick-up from the ultra façade most mega chains spit, and the servers were attentive without being obnoxious (whereas the bussers were perhaps too aggressive with plate snatching and stacking).

Brio is not the place I'll beckon any shopper in Crocker Park to make a B-line for, but would I kick the $4 bar apps out of bed for eating crackers? Not tonight; it's cold outside."}
{"text":"We are fairly new to the Vegas scene and we came from a town that had bee limited options. So this is one reason why I love bug cities...the eateries!!! The food! This was our first sit down Italian restaraunt and it was pretty good. They gave you good size proportions and we had to take it to go.  The pasta was very yummy and soft..almost like homemade pasta. And the deserts were delish!!! Planning on going back soon to get the lobster and shrimp fettuccine again!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a Wednesday night.  $5 martini's and fairly good appetizer specials.   Short rib nachos were tasty but not enough cheese.  Bartender (male, short dark hair) was efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"This is not Olive Garden........I don't mean that in a bad way. Here it is a little more classy. More relaxing and great food! Nice place to take a date or the wife to enjoy a quiet meal and just relax. Servers are very good and nice here."}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE AND if u want a gathering don't think of this place I will never again 
Not sure where to start I booked this place for my daughter's baptism in there privet room I had 36 people they gave me two servers so can u only imagine the service we got we ask for water it takes 30 minutes and most of the drinks we order we end up not getting and not only that it was my daughter baptism and I wasted so much time and effort to get everything and yet the restaurant had ruined it all so embarrassing in front my group friends and family the food they said we will bring food till everyone is full that is not true my tables were empty and I asked them to bring more food and the server tells me that they will charge me more and they brought food out enough for 32 people and she pouts at two kids I had they were eating small portions with us she like I didn't count them and they through us off for food I looked at her I said how much u think they ate I had smile on my face like r u freaking serious and I told and anyways I have picked one of ur family Styal menu then she's like let me go check and my people start asking for food because they didn't get enough so my husband told just bring us more food she like so will charge u double he we were so shocked but my husband is not that type of person that would say anything but yet he said that's fine so now the manger calls overly husband he was the same one I did all my taking and set everything up with me and him I had even asked him how is ur menu is it like family styal he said yes will be bring food till everyone is full so then when he asks for my husband he talked to him and he tells him I will give u %50 off of the second order of food so my husband didn't say anything because again I was dealing with everything so my husband said okay so I go to see what's going on the manger walks away so I ask my husband and he told me what the Magee told him I was like what he thinks he's doing us a favor I wanna talked to him because this is not what we talked about and the manger never came I asked for him twice and he never came we end up paying for 50 people instead of 36 and the second round food was worth nothing because we only got couple of plates and u know what's so sad not the we end up paying that much but was the service very bad and we waited for the food over 30 minutes it made us very mad and embarrassed with our people for my daughter's baptism I will never ever go there or tell anyone about it I have never put a bad review on a restaurant and we own one but this was just too much not to tell people about I don't wanted it to happen to anyone they really ruined my day"}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible here. The server had an attitude like they didn't want to be there. The food was bland, the soup was warm. Bad experience. I read the reviews I guess I probably came at a bad night."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with a friend.

The marlin special sounded good so we both ordered it.

Not such a great idea.  The marlin was overcooked.  My friend said it tasted like chicken.  The roasted veggies were just ok as well.

Next time I'll stick with one of the pasta dishes."}
{"text":"So first of all we had the worst waiter we had ever had in our experience dining out. He was more concerned with his hair than asking my Mom just once if she wanted a refill on her coffee. He just stood in the corner and messed with his hair. We never received bread with our meal and when asked about it he said he would bring it which he never did. We asked about the menu change and he seemed annoyed at the question. On our way out we mentioned to the Manager that we were disappointed with the service and all she said was I'm  sorry in a very insincere way. Will never return to this restaurant chain again"}
{"text":"This is a solid restaurant. 

I've been to a location in Orlando, and now the one in Las Vegas. Every time the food has been consistent, flavorful, and served hot. This particular location has paid close attention to the aesthetics, which from a designer's point of view is always appreciated. 

More important however, when considering any restaurant with multiple locations and above-average prices is the food and service. Again, I have yet to be disappointed. Considering the brusque treatment I got at the Grotto in the Golden Nugget, I was afraid that might be par for the course. Thankfully it isnt. 

Brio's Vegas location in a walking mall is a nice change from the more parking lot-oriented locations in other states. Its nice to be on a patio that isnt overlooking only cars but real pedestrians going about their business. 

For a nice bite of Italian close to McCarran, Brio's Las Vegas location gets my nod."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place great atmosphere and very friendly staff. I had the veal Marcella with fettuccini Alfredo wow just wow it was perfect and tender and enough to take hone for later"}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying if I could give 0 stars I would. This was my first experience at Brio. My boyfriend searched on yelp restaurants in town square and we saw it had great reviews. When we first were seated, the chairs had food on them and we had to switch them out. We decided to order drinks, which took about 20 mins to come. For our entrees 
My boyfriend ordered the chicken limone and I ordered the pasta pesto. It took an entire hour to come to the table. In between the wait, the waiter and manager came over at several times saying it was \"coming out soon \" when the food finally arrived, they informed us they had no angel hair pasta and instead gave us fettuccine. It was old clumpy and not cooked. The meal looked gross and even the waitress agreed it was terrible. The manager came over and apologized but never offered us anything except to remake our food that would take another hour. I will not be returning here ever again!!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! Lobster Bisque is amazing. Food was delicious. Would go again."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a nice surprise.  
My husband and I were vacationing in Vegas and were sick of the constant stimulus of the strip.  This place was recommended for a quiet meal with a romantic vibe.

Let me tell you--Service is important to those who've worked in the service industry. (I used to be a waitress. I know how hard the job is!)

Boy, did we get blessed.  Tamara was our server.  Her bubbly and genuine smile really stood out from the glazed and frozen grins we were starting to get used to.

My husband ordered the salmon salad and said it was a large but perfectly filling light meal.
Tamara dealt with my modifications to their Garden Salad and handled it like a CHAMP! The grilled chicken added to salad was so juicy!  It definitely wasn't some 'garbage' chicken that couldn't be used in another dish. (Again, I know how restaurants work...)

Tamara  wasn't miffed that we weren't drinking and ordered Pelligrino.
But, THIS is Vegas and she did tempt my husband to stumble...off his low-carb diet! 
Per Tamara's suggestion, John ordered the light cheesecake bite AND the peanut butter cup. (When he falls off the bandwagon...forget about it!) He said Tamara's taste buds were right on the money KA-CHING! Her cheesecake won top billing.

If we lived in Vegas I could definitely see us coming here a lot.  In fact, every time we stop by Sin City, we will be nabbing a table here. 

Great job, Tamara. You made this incredible restaurant an experience we will definitely remember. With a smile and attitude like that, the world is your oyster!"}
{"text":"Dear Brio,

After giving you such rave reviews back in 2009, you have kindly let me down in the most unexpected way. See I do understand that you do not take reservations for happy hour, and I totally respect that. However the fact that I came to give you a courtesy head's up that I was bringing around 40+ people over the three hour time spam for my birthday happy hour a week in advance and you kindly but adamantly let me know that you could not accommodate me left me speechless. Your friendly manager kindly explained that he did not want a \"rowdy\" group and that he wanted to keep everything orderly.  He let me know that no I could not hold two tables once I arrived and that my party would be seated separately as they came in to keep everything orderly. So no standing around and being unorderly, et al. Again the look on my face was priceless. Last I check I was almost 40 and my friends don't get \"rowdy\" but ok whatever. However I still had a friendly smile and thanked your manager for letting me know that in so many words he did not want my business and that I needed to find a new venue.

Yea hmm wow. No worries. I found another place that welcomed me with open arms for my birthday happy hour and they don't mind if we stand around and get a little \"rowdy\".  

Love,
Ebs"}
{"text":"Me and two girlfriends were out and about in Vegas this past weekend and after all the window shopping we had done, we realized we were famished. So we drove and came upon Brio. The first thing out of me and my friends mouth was HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS!!!! See we frequent the Brio in Scottsdale and we love their happy hour special in which a select few of their appetizers are all $2.95. We snag a great parking spot and walk into Brio where the sign says happy hour 3-7 in the bar. SCORE!

We are immediately seated and our waiter comes over to take our drink orders and we say may we also get the happy hour menu. He proceeds to say that happy hour doesn't start until 3:30pm but I say your sign says 3pm.  He proceeds to tell me still needs to be changed but happy hour does not start to 3:30pm. We say fine, we will wait the 20mins until happy hour starts. He proceeds to walk away but what he doesn't realize is that I am still watching him and I swear the look on his face was like these bitches.... So needless to say when he came back I called him out on it. He let me know that if his face conveyed that then he was very sorry and that he apologies for the misunderstanding. Hmm suspect... (however he got back into my good gracious later)

We order Brio Burgers, Ravioli Caprese, Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta and Sliced Steak Bruschetta. Now we have had this before at the Scottsdale Brio and each time the burgers have been perfect and the bruschetta has been divine. This time not so much. The burger was perfect on the inside but burnt on the outside, the Ravioli and all the Brushchetta came out lukewarm at best. Our waiter came over to ask how everything was and I was like eh do you really want to know? So we told him that we weren't happy but we were hungry and we would eat it anyway. He offered to make everything again but we declined as we had already waited for about 30 mins for the food after we ordered. He says I will tell the manager and she may come over to talk to you.

Well the GM came over to talk to us and asked how things were. We told her that we were use to how great everything was at the Scottsdale location and we came here because of that notion and we were disappointed but hey for $2.95 per appetizer, we cannot complain too much. She said that she had just spent a month at the Scottsdale location and this was her first day back and she apologized for the meal and she said she would take care of it for us. We were all like wow, thank you that is very generous. She asked if we wanted anything else and we declined and thanked her again.

Little did we know that when she said she would take care of it for us, she meant the entire bill!! Drinks and all. We asked for the bill thinking we had to at least pay for our drinks and our waiter let us know that the entire bill had been taken care of. WOW! We did leave our waiter a nice tip and left out of there shaking our heads. 

So maybe this Brio was having an off afternoon but I give it 1.5 stars for the food but 5 stars for the GM for being extra generous."}
{"text":"I know two reviews for the same restaurant. Hey it was different locations so they each get their own review.  :) 

Unlike the Scottsdale location in which I was there for happy hour, for this location, I was here for lunch and let me tell you they did not disappoint. The decor was really nice on the inside, however since it was such a nice day outside, we decided to have lunch outside. Our waiter was a sweetheart who could not have been a day over 16 tops.  I think we made the poor kid blush on more than one occasion. 

So onto the food. Me and my friend Tanya ordered the same thing, Crab & Shrimp Cakes. OMG they were so, so good. The came out nice and hot and were filled with lots of shrimp and crab. Unlike some places you just get alot of filler. Here, they definitely did not skimp on the amount of shrimp and crab they put into these cakes. I swear if we could have licked our plates we probably could have.

You would think that that the yummy lunch would be enough. Oh no, we just had to have some dessert as well before we started on our shopping excurision. (Note to self, don't eat so much before going shopping or nothing you try on will fit quite right). Ok so back to the dessert, although I am not sure it is still on the menu as we visited during the summer, the dessert I chose was the key lime pie mini dessert. Now can we say that was just a huge tease! lol. Seriously it was very good and it took everything in us not to order another one each. All in all, I had a great time while visiting Brio and I look forward to going to visit again soon."}
{"text":"We had a discount coupon for this restaurant and visited for the first time. Upon arrival we discovered the majority of the seating is outside on an enclosed covered patio. Even though they had heat lamps it was chilly. We decided to wait for an indoor table. The wait lasted almost 30 minutes and there's very little area to stand in while waiting.

This restaurant has a VERY lively bar that you can also dine at. It was full and loud. The layout of the restaurant is laid back but accommodates few tables in the main dining area. The entire end of the restaurant restaurant is taken up by the trio that plays on the weekends. Fearing the noise we were happy to find that the trio played familiar but low keyed music that didn't interfere with the dining experience.

Now the food. It was very good with emphasis on Italian naturally. We ordered different items and all were quite good with enough left over to take home. Our waiter was outstanding, friendly, competent and kidding. Every time he brought out a dish he would say, \"Take a Picture\". It was funny.

Anyway I don't think we will go back. While we enjoyed the food, the atmosphere just was found wanting. When you make a reservation that should ask if you want indoor or outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Although the Lasagna remains one of the best in the valley- the overall  condition of the restaurant and the lack of server professionalism prompts this less than stellar review. A past favorite however, the restaurant needs a serious deep clean! The  floors, chandeliers, silk plants and even the wall areas around the kitchen vents (clearly in view from the dining area) seem neglected and in my opinion unacceptable in a restaurant. It made me feel - what is the food quality?  It was fine by the way!
Our server, Ashley- needs additional training on service as she constantly walked up to our table and abruptly interrupted our conversation.  
With so many options nearby - this location needs attention to stay in the mix !"}
{"text":"I've frequented Brio plenty of times with friends and family, and it has always been a good option. With that in mind, there are a few\"Dos and Don'ts\" that I'd recommend:

~ Don't be afraid to explore the menu. I enjoy a myriad of different dishes ranging from the steak to the pasta. My friends also enjoy dishes such as the pork chops. 

~ If venturing for dinner, I would avoid the basic salads as the price doesn't warrant the size. Lunch time is a much better deal. 

~ GET THE CARAMEL MASCARPONE CHEESECAKE! IT'S F***ING AMAZING!!!

~ For this specific location, I've found that during peak times, their service seems to slow down quite tremendously--more so than you'd expect. Off-hours are best and quick if you're in a hurry. 

Overall, if you're looking for a good restaurant with a wide variety of options, Brio is a solid pick. And remember...GET THE CARAMEL MASCARPONE CHEESECAKE!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  That being said, I was ultimately surprised when our waitress in the bar section was a little too sarcastic or trying too hard to be nice, like it was physically hurting her to do so... She explained our menus like we looked confused as to what she even had handed us.  I was turned off immediately by how apathetic she was being.  We were done with our meal and two other waiters asked us if we wanted the bill.  15 mins go by, four servers stood by the checkout while we painstakingly waited at our table.  We honestly could have just got up and walked out with no discrepancies...  Also I bartend, my fiancé is a competitive bartender as well so we know professionalism.  A older bartender got woodford reserve out and left it on the bar for 5mins... He free handed the sketchiest old fashioned I've ever seen... And then did not put the bottle back in its place.  The second bartender came around and poured water yet did nothing about the bottle that was still out.  The original tender passed it four more times without putting it back.  He also proceeded to stick an unopened straw into a shot he poured but had found something in the drink that wasn't supposed to be there. It was an unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"I am a little disappointed. My friends were bragging how great this place is and how wonderful the food is to eat.

We sat on the patio and the seats were not very comfortable. I thought for a nice restaurant, the seats would be more cozy. They were not very comfy on the seat part. I also noticed that they were snug on the sides which could make it tight for those with bigger hips.

Next was our waiter. He took our order then he disappeared. He never came back for refills. I ordered a wildberry lemonade and got my dinner first before getting my drink. I had to remind our waiter about my drink. I guess they ran out of berries.

Next I ordered a chicken risotto. Good, but it didn't seem like very munch compared to the rest of the dishes at the table. I finished first and ended up watching my friends eat. Our waiter came back, took my empty dish and my water cup. No refills were offered. When he came back asking for anything else, I asked for a water while my friend ordered a cappuccino. I had to WAIT again, this time just for water.

I probably wont come back here again and I WILL not recommend this place to friends. It's a shame what a bad experience can do."}
{"text":"Valentina was a great server very polite and efficient. The food was great also it was my first visit and would recommend it to my friends."}
{"text":"Came here for my little cousins birthday yesterday for lunch, all 30 of us! Let's just say our server did pretty well accommodating all of us, and was pretty attentive. I ordered the carbonara and I wasn't too impressed, but my spouse got the alla vodka and it was delicious, will definitely order that next time. Pretty atmosphere and food came out in a very timely matter!"}
{"text":"Brio is your typical Italian chain. It's ok, not terrible, not great. They have a gluten free menu, which is good news. My daughter was able to order GF Mac n cheese. She was happy but it did taste pretty salty. They have a huge beef carpaccio which is pretty tasty. Their carbonara sauce doesn't have peas in it and is not as fresh tasting as I would like. My other daughter had salmon, she complained to me that it was too cooked on the bottom. The food obviously wasn't great but our waiter was fantastic."}
{"text":"Well, I picked this place for our 22 year old daughters birthday dinner.  Thought it would be a nice little place for our dinner.   Service was horrible. I waited tables back in my youth, just like most of us have, and this guy was just incredibly rude, snotty and a complete jack ass.

The worst part of this nightmare was I had to have my husband pull over 3 times on the way home so I could vomit.

When I got my meal I wasn't quite sure what was wrong with it but I ate it.  BIG MISTAKE.  Then everyone at my table tasted it and all said it was sour.   Yes.  The second time around I can confirm.  It was sour.  Very sour.

And to think I paid well over $100 to vomit.   On the side of the road.  Three times.  

Wouldn't go here again if it was the last place in the valley serving warm food.  No thank you.  I'm going to brush my teeth and never think of this place again."}
{"text":"I have to say this place gets ALL FIVE STARS!  Delicious!  I've eaten at a lot of places in Las Vegas and Food is good, service is great (in particular our waiter Justin), everything is top notch."}
{"text":"Tivoli Village location has horrible service. That alone made this place so terribly annoying. I have eaten at Brio all across the U.S. because its consistently good food and service. Not this location unfortunately. 

Waiter took 20 min to acknowledge us. Was nowhere to be found during the meal and filled our glasses once. I had to get up and look for the guy in the front of the kitchen to get him to come back to our table. And to top it off my $20 plate of Chicken Limone was nothing more than chicken on pasta. Missing the lemon completely on taste and only present in presentation. 

I should have ordered what I normally order but I was feeling adventurous. I live in this neighborhood and am here daily so I expect to come back and have better service. You need to if you are going to stay afloat in Tivoli.


I'll revisit and update, hopefully with better news."}
{"text":"Another review started the beginning of December... I'm seriously falling behind! Server was great... Crab cakes were ice cold inside... GM Chris was awesome. Tried his best to make it right but I have a strict 'don't eat sent back food' policy... Appreciate the effort but every time I try this location, I am disappointed. The pasta always tastes like it was partially cooked and then was re heated but not all the way? Like rubberie...anyway, great patio location!"}
{"text":"I choose poorly. Came here today on a business lunch. My first time here. Everyone raves about it. Beautiful restaurant. Great waitstaff. Everything on the menu sounded great. I choose the shrimp risotto with tomato bisque. The soup was the best thing. The sourdough bread was fantastic, but my risotto was disappointing. I think it was a little over cooked. The shrimp were great. Cooked fresh to perfection, but I think the risotto might have been sitting around awhile. Seemed more like oatmeal. A bit bland too. For an $11 lunch item it was very small. Smallest portion at the table of five. The club sandwich next to me was at least twice as much food. I cleaned my plate and was satisfied but not full. The guy next to me couldn't finish his sandwich and homemade chips, which were pretty good."}
{"text":"While shopping one afternoon around the mall on a warm day, my friend and I decided to have a light bite at the Brio Tuscan Grille. We started with the ever so delicious raspberry mojito. It was light and crisp; just not so heavy on the alcohol and just the perfect amount of sweetness. We ordered the Beef Carpaccio with extra field greens. To our surprise, thank goodness we ordered the half portion, the plate was pretty big. The mustard aioli was very good. 

The very next day we decided to go back for dinner, which is the reason why I gave this restaurant 3-stars. The afternoon quick bite experience wasn't as great as the dinner one. For dinner, I ordered the Shrimp & Scallop Risotto and chopped salad and my friend ordered the Pasta BRIO. Unfortunately, the chopped salad came after we were served dinner and the risotto was almost like uncooked rice. Yah, not so much! So, the manager of the restaurant brought my plate back and brought me out another order. This time the risotto was better, but not great. I wasn't that impressed. My friend enjoyed the Pasta Brio very  much. 

All in all, the location, the ambiance, the service were good, but the food was ok. I guess I'll order something else next time."}
{"text":"Shout out to nick at front desk. After a mishap at carry out. He owned the mistake and offered a full refund. For a young guy he already understands the importance of service recovery. Also provided a teachable moment for my kids. Thanks Nick you will always be successful in service with this type of attitude."}
{"text":"The food is so good. 
Service was on point 
Parking is good, only if the mall is not too busy!
The food portion was good. 
I ordered children's plates & they were full. 
The ticket for 3 adults & 2 kids was around $100.00"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant five stars because they went out of their way to make our party of 20 a perfect evening. The service was outstanding and the food was delicious and they took care of 10 adults and 10 kids with no problem. If you have a large group I highly recommend this restaurant. We sat in the north Terrace and we had the room all to ourselves. Thank you all including the general manager who came out and greeted us as well for a great experience."}
{"text":"I visited Brio last saturday; and we were treated like royalty; the service was perfect; food was delicious; wine recommendations were also divine!  This restaurant is a must for Italian food/service!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and beautiful venue. The bread app that they start you out with is to die for. Server was very attentive and very friendly but I forget her name. I got their ravioli pasta and at first glance, it seemed small but by the time i was done, i was full."}
{"text":"Olive Garden is better for way less money. The food is nothing special and the pasta is too well done. The bread was good however. The decor is good but I can't eat it."}
{"text":"Solid spot good for large groups. Menu and food is nothing to remember but wouldn't expect much more given it is a chain."}
{"text":"I like to come to Brio when in Cleveland. A nice menu, good staff, and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant located off the Strip in the Town Center shopping mall.  The food is consistent and the atmosphere is good.  Prices are not bad either.  If you want good Italian food, come here.  We had excellent service, and they had live music outside.  We had the iceberg wedge salad, a pasta dish and shrimp mediterranean and all was excellent.  They have large deserts if you want to share, or small ones if you want to have something different.  The area is nice to walk off your meal too."}
{"text":"5 star lobster risotto if there were 7 stars I would give them all. Perfectly al dente cooked, very nice taste. This dish is top 5 on my bucket list."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour . Seated ourselves in a booth . Sat for 12 minutes before we were greeted . Sat 10 minutes before water , then asked to order . Waited about 45 minutes for our appetizers ... 
 Sat another 10 before we received any utensils to eat our food . Wanted ketchup ... waited 10 minutes before our waiter told us they are out of ketchup LOL .  
Honestly it was slow service and ok food .... waited wasn't nice or rude . 
Probably don't be back ."}
{"text":"Best Italian restaurant that I've been to in Arizona the waiters and waitresses always greet you with a smile and they take very good care of you and every time I go whatever manager is there is always very involved in the customer's experience they're always visible and walking around asking everybody how's it going there's nothing that I would change"}
{"text":"Wow. I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting the Olive Garden but this place is much better than that. Their food isn't anything groundbreaking, but it is good. I had one of their dinner specials, the blackened scallops on pesto risotto, and thought it was great. The scallops were large and weren't gritty at all. The risotto was a pretty good consistency (not the best I've ever had, but still good) and had some bold flavors with the pesto and mushrooms. This dish is different than the shrimp and scallop risotto on their daily menu, by the way. 

I love the fact that you can get small samplings of their desserts for 2.45 a shot. They're large enough to satisfy your sweet tooth without feeling like you're bingeing on a huge piece of cake or whatever. Most of the desserts are tasty, but not spectacular. The tiramisu and cheesecake are probably the best. I was impressed with the food and the interior of the place. It was a nice casual atmosphere and a relatively inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"Love this place, food is good and price is good. 
I love the strawberry salad, pasta la vodka, risotto are my favorite.
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Really slow service, manager nowhere to be seen. Staff caught lying and give you inconsistent stories and excuses about a request to move to a different table or to at least open the umbrellas so you don't fry while you wait 20 minutes for a mimosa or 30 minutes for a simple caesar salad or a total of an hour for your main course. If you go, hope all goes magically well but don't expect unsatisfactory situations to be fixed or be handled properly."}
{"text":"Great restaurant...I work with someone who lives in the northwest part of the valley and since I'm in the southeast...it's a great location for us to meet in the middle for lunch or dinner.

The food is excellent - not on the inexpensive side, but definitely worth the money for such good quality and taste.  I'm particularly fond of the Mezza Chicken Limone and end up getting that almost every time we go, although I've had the chopped salad as well and it's great.

I like that the menu flags a number of items that are under 595 calories so if you are counting them at all or just want to know what might be a healthier choice - they make it really easy.

Love the outside seating (and there is plenty of it) - especially if we're trying to get some work done...the inside can get a little bit noisy.  Service is excellent...beyond reproach, in fact.  Definitely the place you want to go to for a business lunch."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with a great ambiance. However, with that being said, the perfection of the decor and space did not match the food. We had a party of 6 and we ordered different things and all dishes were mediocre at best. I ordered the lasagna and my mom ordered the fettuccine and both dishes were very dry. My mom had to ask for more sauce for her dry noodles. No where close to traditional Italian food, very disappointing. The wine list was decent though. Also we had excellent service. Just wished the food lived up to the beautiful space and great service, since the food is really what I'm paying for."}
{"text":"A franchise restaurant in a mall adjacent to the airport posing as Le Circe with prices that are far too expensive for a dressed up Macaroni Grill with vaulted ceilings that are unable to mute nor dampen the subway station levels of noise on the main dining floor."}
{"text":"Called and spoke to Crystal who was going to have her manager Brian contact me. I was looking for a place to do my co-workers retirement party. Never received a phone call back. This was going to be a party for 15+ people. Makes me laugh that they have all this money that they don't care enough to pick up the phone and call. Thank gosh for Maggiano's, they were awesome and excited to accommodate us. So if your looking for a professional place that can handle a big party. Maggiano's is your place."}
{"text":"5 star food and service. My wife and I come here all the time. An awesome place to eat, people watch and enjoy in town square. I have been coming here for a long time, I guess today was the first time i'm writing a review."}
{"text":"I've been to brio several times and I'm not sure why but I never leave feeling like the food was great, just okay, and I've tried new things every time. I'm not sure what it is to be honest"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed by this restaurant. We expected to be impressed, and simply were not. This place does not live up to its hype. 

We came here for a birthday dinner, and I had a certificate for a free Beef Medallions with Shrimp Scampi. We also ordered the Brio Chopped salad and Calamari. 

The salad was delicious, but we weren't impressed by much else. The calamari was tasteless to say the least. The beef medallions were not cooked to our preference- we ordered them medium rare and they came out well done. The shrimp scampi included only a few shrimp on top of the medallions, all sitting on a bed of orzo pasta and small pieces of roasted vegetables tossed in a sauce. 

We were just disappointed. I would suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"My department of 8 came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon.  Without a reservation, we only had to wait 5 mins prior to be seated.  The lunch menu was pretty decent.  Many options to chose from, such as salad, pasta, paninis, flatbreads and more.

I decided to go with angel hair pasta with salmon.  The angel hair pasta was cooked perfectly, not too soft, not too hard.  The salmon was a a tad bit more cooked than I would have liked, but because there was a nice scampi butter sauce, it was still delicious.

I will definitely return to try their items on the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Good food 
Amazing atmosphere 
But such a slow servers. 
It's took as almost 45 min to start eating
The manager was very friendly and try to help as out but if they can't handle full dinner let as wait outside better than have a bad service"}
{"text":"Gave it another shot, and we had a better experience. 

Salad was great, and my chicken was great. 

Still not at the top of our list, but a good quick date night. They also do reservations! Nice for this area of mormon food junkies."}
{"text":"Best tasting happy hour food by far!!! Came after work with some coworkers & will def be back. 

The egg plant fries are BOMB!!! The shrimp is BOMB!!! The burger is BOMB!!! All off the happy hour menu. 

Not a disappointment when the food is delish!!"}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Had to flag down server for more water and to order wine. Crab Cake Entree came out cold. Caprese Salad has tomato with the sticker still on it."}
{"text":"One of the best place I've been in Las Vegas. We sat outside at the bar. Despite the heat we had a great time. The food was very tasty. The portions generous for the price and the staff very friendly. The wait time isn't bad for such a good place. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"El fresco. Patio dining at its best.  Celebrating my birthday with two special friends, Pat and Joan. Can't go wrong at Brio."}
{"text":"I don't get a date night that often.  Gave it a shot with this reputable brand but was disappointed.  Food ordered was calamari, caprese salad, and the nine ounce filet with Gorgonzola crust and roasted vegetables.  I ordered a planned dessert of creme brûlée to be brought after our dinner was consumed.  Meat was phenomenal.  Was cooked well done despite my tastes, yet retained juice and texture.  Amazing bite.  The accompanying veggie partnership was well thought of.  

I found no issue with the caprese or the calamari.  Both were well made for a hometown Italian place like this.  I was impressed with the flavor profile of the mozzarella and the crisp texture of the squid.  

My issue was with the timing.  We received our apps, salads, and main course simultaneously and then never received our dessert at all.  The timing had put off my date, whom said Brio is fired.  Despite my likings for this menu, I probably won't come back much, due to this experience."}
{"text":"I decided to get myself some dinner after a nice day of shopping in Vegas yesterday.. I should've went to the whole foods around the corner instead of this Italian restaurant because the service was horrific !!! the bread was  stale I ordered penne alla vodka with no pancetta and the gentleman brought me a gnocchi ravioli with ricotta cheese ....when I went to send it back he tried to argue with me to tell me that in the menu it says something else ....and I told him that I know what the menu says because I ordered Penne alla vodka  he then sent the manager over who was very nice she offered to pay for my entire dinner asked me if I needed anything else and I told her that she needed to hire people that can read and write... Let me add that I specifically requested penne pasta with allla vodka sauce no ricotta cheese and no pancetta ..if The waiter or the chef had an issue with my order they should've told me but instead of that my order was completely disregarded and that's to the gentleman who decided to message me privately who is now blocked"}
{"text":"Can't say that I have had a better Italian meal.  The veal was awesome...I inhaled the scrumptious pasta and roasted veggies...the bruscetta sampler was very tasty and the dessert/dolcini sampler was over the top outstanding....too bad I was too full to competely enjoy.  The wedge salad was also tasty and the lemonade was so good.  Best service in Vegas....Q was the most attentive waiter ever...he even told me...we will make anything you want....who says that?  Can't wait to return in November ...our new favorite! !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal.  The portions are big too."}
{"text":"Pretty solid place in Town Square  for lunch or dinner.  Good food with a nice flair, pretty noisy because it is usually crowded.  Happy hour has some cheap dishes if you want to try some different things.  I recommend the Chicken Milanase and the Caesar salads.  Average prices for the type of restaurant.  Great place when the weather is nice to sit in the patio with the fire pits.  Great place for groups as well, very accommodating.  I recommend this, one if my favorite places in Town Square."}
{"text":"I have no complaints for a change. Brio had a lively atmosphere, and the host brought me to my table. She was sweet and talkative, very nice indeed. My server came and discussed the specials then brought me my ice tea. The bread was warm and delicious and then I ordered my meal... 
For starters I had minestrone soup, it was rich and savory, I could taste hints of bacon, ground beef,Garbanzo beans, and so much more...Delicious. Then my ceasers salad, the croutons were the best. 
For my main course, I had blackened Tilapia with potatoes, and it was PERFECT. The server was spot on with my ice tea refills and I have no complaints. It was a very good dining experience and the food did not disappoint me."}
{"text":"Beautiful place inside of Town Square. Usually order the Lasagna but went with the Crispy Chicken salad. Really nice place. Waiter was very friendly & knowledgable."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a solid 4.5 stars but I had to bump it up for the location. This spot is definitely one of my favorites close to the strip. Town Square is such a great place to walk around and shop and then to stop here and have a bite to eat of some bueno Italian food with a beer or a glass of wine is a great way to top off the night unless you go see a movie afterward which is great too. 
I like to sit outside and enjoy the Vegas summer night and watch people walk around as they go in and out of stores while I eat my food. If it's to hot outside the inside is very well designed and looks extremely fancy with good A/C and it's not as expensive as it looks like it should be."}
{"text":"If you order the family pasta Brio for delivery, be sure to request extra sauce or it's DRY when it arrives.  Hope the kitchen adapts the recipe for delivery.  Also beware of the sharp tin lid to avoid cutting yourself on it. Grub Hub provided prompt service and it was nice to have tasty food without heating up the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Around 4:00 on a Sunday my boyfriend, brother and I go in and we get promptly seated because there weren't too many people eating that early. Our hostess and the woman who sat us were pleasant. However, after over ten minutes of not being acknowledged by any of the severs walking by, we got up and left. The hostess and woman who sat us watched us walk out with no acknowledgement-no longer pleasant I guess? I can only assume this is how they treat anyone who doesn't look like they \"fit in\" to a \"nice\" restaurant like theirs. We are young and although we were dressed appropriately, it must not have been nice enough. I only assume this because I couldn't see any other reason we didn't get served. I have been on the other side of the food business and know that there is a stereotype against young people and them not tipping which I have always found ridiculous because I know it's not true. But, good thing The Cheesecake Factory is right there and that server seemed to appreciate our business."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant Brio is always on point. The food is excellent quality and well prepared. The service and experience is consistently good. Service was most excellent at this location. We enjoyed the appetizer flat breads and my salad was excellent. We were in a business meeting so the waiter was great about keeping water and soda glasses filled without interrupting us. Great experience."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding but the experience is big chain restaurant unfortunately. Let me be clear, there was nothing wrong with the experience of lunch today at this wonderfully located spot, but there is an opportunity to give an experience that is special. Our experience was nothing short of average - staff act like we are out of town tourists who won't come back again. A little training on service and delivering a good experience would go a long way to make this spot 5 star.

With that said the food is outstanding - fresh, properly flavored and displayed. The food will bring us back, the overall experience needs work."}
{"text":"Our night started off with a 25 minute late reservation, but in spite of getting sat so late, the food and service were exceptional. 

Our waiter was super friendly and knowledgable about the menu. He made some good suggestions. 

I had the bruschetta quatro along with the salmon Fresca. I wasn't feeling in the mood for salmon so I swapped it out for chicken. 

Overall this place is good. Love the environment, the food is great, and we liked the service."}
{"text":"Great food and greatt service! The restaurant is beautiful! Makes you feel like to are in Italy!"}
{"text":"After the day I had dealing with lousy customer service reps, this was an oasis of awesome. Our server Michael was truly excellent. Funny, attentive and knew the menu. Made great recommendations. We loved our food. I had the lobster fettuccine and my husband had the pesce piccata. Love! Also try the raspberry monitor. A prefect experience start to finish."}
{"text":"Part of the national chain.  Great place to go before or after a movie since you can make reservations on Open Table.  Great for Sunday brunch.  Good selection of appetizers and pasta and non-pasta entrees.  Good wine list.  Attentive service.  Solid choice"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, everyone in our party enjoyed their meals, from cheese stuffed ravioli to lamb to veal.

Service was attentive and prompt."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is one of the best Happy Hours in town. Hours are 3 to 6:30.   I had attempted to try Happy Hour here once before but it was packed and now I know why.  All the drinks are $5 and the apps are $3.95.  I had the Strawberry Mojito and the boyfriend had the Mango Mojito.  For food we ordered the Margherita Flatbread and the Ravioli Caprese.  Everything was good.  This is a spot you need to get to early to secure seating but well worth it!  Five stars if  it ended at 7:00!"}
{"text":"I feel I have given Tivoli Village long enough to get their shit straight. I don't know if the cost of rent in this place is so low it invites the kind of \"who cares if it fails\" culinary experimentation, or if it is so high restaurants are forced to try and sell you crap at a premium. 

As an outside observer, it would seem as if Brio Tuscan Grille is the only restaurant that has managed to survive the Tivoli Village curse. Unfortunately, its mere survival does not preclude the fact that the restaurant as a whole is, well just blah. One look at the main photo on its Yelp page speaks volumes, the burger looks like something I would expect at my third cousin's \"backyard birthday bonanza\" for her 6 year old - they even cut it up in sections for the kiddies.

The food is not bad, and quite honestly I am impressed with the portion size of their appetizers, as they simply whet your appetite, not drown it. The unfortunate part is that the appetizers are only good if they are half off during happy-hour - I can't imagine paying full price for that. Which leads us to the rest of the menu, where the price points are where you would expect them to be if you were dining on the Strip. Not that I don't have great hope that Tivoli eventually becomes a great dining destination worthy of the high-dolar restaurants, but if it is Friday night and your place is half empty - well I'm just saying.

The service itself was okay, but one doesn't feel an abundance of warmth from the staff. Don't get me wrong, they did everything right and in a timely manner, it's just that there was no warmth there.

I won't go as far as to say that Brio Tuscan Grille is a disappointment, I just can't imagine waiting in line for this place, which is probably why there isn't one."}
{"text":"Went for the Happy early happy hour.All the food items are $2.95 from a selective menu at the bar area so we tried a few.
I enjoyed the Ravioli Caprese the Burger,ans the Shrimp and Eggplant. They were nice big portions and full of great flavors. The steak brushetta was ok, a liitle overwhelming with the cheese. I had 2 beers and my wife had a mixed dink and our bill was only$30. Great place to have a few drinks, a bite to eat and a cool scene if your lucky enough to get a seat on the couches outside. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite and shared the Bruschetta Sampler, Bisteca Salad, and a Fettuccine dish that was a couple minutes shy of al dente...

Luckily the Italian peach tea helped me wash the pasta down. The dessert tray didn't look appetizing, so we passed on the sweets.

Next time we're in the area, I'd rather dine at Yard House instead...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Right up there with good non-chain restaurants. My daughter and I had the salmon salad and gluten-free grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. Everything was done very well. My salmon was cooked to perfection, crispy in the surface and yet tender and juicy inside. Her chicken was tasty and moist as well. Solidly good wine list too, if a bit pricy for such an establishment. Service friendly and efficient. I'd definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The location is splendid.  Truly elegant, despite being a fast casual restaurant. The food is a bit uneven.  Not sure they are the most fastidious with the cleaning and service, either.  But if you're out shopping and touring, not a bad place to stop in for a bite.  Desserts are large and filling, as are the pasta plates."}
{"text":"Great for a lunch salad with girlfriends...  if you're not into rabbit food, the pasta lunch specials are tasty too, but be prepared to nap the rest of your workday... :)"}
{"text":"The interior is sooooo much cuter/nicer than I would have expected from the outside. We sat on the patio which was really nice, although, you do hear all the planes flying overhead the whole time.  Service was fast and polite. The bread brought out before our entrees was really delicious and warm. I don't know why, but I thought I would mention that...
I ordered the brunch special which was Eggs Oscar - two poached eggs with a shrimp  crab cake over potatoes and veggies. It was very tasty and the eggs were cooked perfectly. My sister got the pesto pasta which she said she really liked. I tasted it, a little bland for me, but she really seemed to enjoy it. 
We didn't try it but I have been told by a few people that the white peach sangria is really good. 
We got the little desserts in shot glasses - tiramisu for me (good) and key lime for her (amazing!!!)
I would love to come here with a group and sit inside because the atmosphere is so cute and the menu seems like it would have something for everyone."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience at Brio.    Here for a volleyball tournament and was asked by the captains to set up a dinner for the team and parents.    

Made a reservation for a party of 30.   They were very accommodating and didn't even demand that we order off of the catering menu.  So we were able to sample from the dinner menu.  

We were amazed that they were able to serve us all at the same time, the food was hot and everyone enjoyed their meal.    For 30 people that was a feat.  Service was exceptional.   The restaurant was beautiful.    Their mini desserts was wonderful as each of us could sample something yummy without overdosing on sugar.  

Would highly recommend Brio Tuscan Grill to parties large and small - For special occasions, first dates and groups."}
{"text":"What a joke! I've wanted to go to this place for quite some time. So yesterday a friend and I planned to go for happy hour. Well we went and was quite disgusted about the way they handle the seating arrangements for happy hour. You can have happy hour at the bar or at designated tables with fire pits on the patio ONLY. Oh you can sit at a table right next to the ones with a fire pit, a mere 3 inches away; but you have to order from a regular menu and pay full price. Who's hair brain idea is this? Poor business practice and well, just plain fucking stupid. So save yourself the frustration and go to Tommy Bahamas or the Blue Martini as every table and person is offered the happy hour menu and pricing regardless of where you sit, just so long as you go during the designated hours. I'm still in shock.  Completely disappointed.  I'm spreading the word to any one that will listen. I will never give this place one dime and I would encourage those reading this to do the same. They need a new business plan and manager."}
{"text":"My 93 year-old Father-in-Law, husband and I have lunch every Thursday somewhere in town and Brio is one of our favorites.  Not only is the Valet parking virtually right outside their entrance to make it convenient for Dad's walker (and stamina), the greeting we received by the host and hostess was genuine.  From the moment we sat down the waiter and other staff were very attentive and made us feel welcomed.  From the outrageously good sourdough bread to the coffee at the end of the meal, we enjoyed our time together in a relaxing, beautiful atmosphere.  Thank you Tom (our waiter) and Jesse (manager) for a special day at your fine restaurant.  We will continue to come back more often."}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this one!? Okay, I know - the atmosphere! The Town Square location is the grander of the two in the Las Vegas area.  There are dramatic high ceilings with beautifully draped material flowing from the rafters.  The place is huge and although there is a wait at times, it moves along quickly.

The food has been consistently good. Being Italian, I dislike Italian chain restaurants, but this is not one of them.  The ravioli is superb as is all of their pasta dishes judging from the reaction of our guests and our own experience.  Their desserts are wonderful, and they even have \"tapas\" size to make you feel less guilty.

The newest location in Summerlin is smaller and a little less showy than the Town Square site. However, this just makes it a totally different experience; same great food, but \"cozier\" feel.  Lots of fun on a Saturday when the Farmers Market sets up at the site!

For lunch or dinner, this place is a sure hit."}
{"text":"I love Brio!
I eat here several times a month, sometimes lunch, sometimes happy hour and often dinner. The staff is always friendly and efficient. I voted for Executive Chef, Joe Milbert's fabulous Autumn pasta dish and he won a trip to Italy over all the other chefs who entered. He is now the acting General Manager and is doing an excellent job in an extremely busy position. 
The food is always delicious. Today I am wolfing down my favorite wedge salad anywhere, the Bistecca, but at happy hour, my choice is often the super good burger. All the servers are upbeat, and give us extra good service!
I will be looking for you, join us at this lovely restaurant."}
{"text":"We have a group of friends who love Brio's and often enjoy the Scottsdale location but we agree unanimously that this San Tan location is even better. Not only is the room much fresher and quieter  but the staff is outstanding! We were greeted at the front door by GM Joe Milbert who escorted us to a very nice table location and made sure we were all comfortable and had everything we needed to make our visit perfect. We had a very skilled waiter named John who showed us just the right combination of constantly attending to our every need but not smothering or bothering us. He was most charming. The lobster bisque I ordered was so delicious and had more lobster meat in it than any I have tasted. Their wedge salad is the best ever. I try to order it often because of the huge chunks of tasty blue cheese, bacon and tomatoes. GM Joe explained that they used to call it the Bistecca because it is served with a really big steak knife. He also backed up our waiter to make sure I got my birthday discount and that we all had a separate check and our Brio Club visits recorded. We all felt like members of a special Italian family by the time we left. Thanks Joe and John for a 5 star lunch."}
{"text":"The bartenders rock!! Brandon, Mike, and Christine rules. They always remember their customers. That's best of the best.  Also those flax crackers are unreal. One of the waitstaff always keeps me loaded."}
{"text":"Food was good but nothing exceptional, the restaurant is quite busy and noisy on a Saturday even when the rest of town square is calm. Good wine and apps probably a great place for happy hour given the wine selection but generally a bit overpriced for the quality of service."}
{"text":"We've always enjoyed this restaurant! We've been here for corporate holiday dinners and just normal night out at town dinners. If you go here for brunch on the weekends I recommend coming in around 1045am. They open at 11am but the doors open at 1030am. 1045am will only be a 15min wait.. if you come right at 11, the wait time might be longer. It does get busy at open, especially Sunday mornings. For the quality of the food, the price is excellent! Great food for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place.... 5 stars without a doubt! The food, service, parking, people... I love every single thing about it. This place is a place you would want to take a business associate ... Or you significant other... Or your best friend... Or your... Or your... Just about anyone that wants to enjoy and awesome fresh made meal! I had the salmon salad that was to DIE for. I asked for my salmon medium... And it was perfect!  The service was impeccable and the place was clean as a whistle! I loved that they didn't have a bar scene with a bunch of bar flies hanging around. This place is clean and classy!! I will be back EVERY CHANCE I get!!"}
{"text":"EPIC Happy hour. Soooo I came to this place a few years ago to meet a girl friend of mine for happy hour. EPIC. The food is great and cheap and the cocktails are the same. The location is CLEAN and open and busy.  All of the locations have a bar that wraps around from inside to the outside patio with a cover and misters... since it gets so darn hot in Vegas. I love that and love to sit out there when its not soooo hot. 

Parking here can be a challenge depending on the day, so you will want to park in the South Parking Garage and walk across the street.

Now, if you start with an appetizer and a few cocktails and decide to move to the main dinning area for dinner, they are more than happy to accommodate you. Or.... if your fine in the spot you have choose, DONT want to move to the dinning room.. you can do that too. 

The Staff here is AWESOME!  I cant tell you how many times I have been here looking to get a booth in the Bar area for happy hour, to meet some friends, and the waitress or waiter has made it a point to watch out for me to grab the next open one :).  I love it when people are nice and looking out for you.  

the food is GREAT, Service is GREAT, location is CLEAN and Bright AND... It can accommodate a TON of people. 

This is my Favorite Happy Hour spot for Vegas... so far!"}
{"text":"Basically Brio is basically a slightly upscale Olive Garden. It is slightly upgraded in every way. The decor is more handsome and there are some expensive materials used to help justify the pricing. The unlimited bread sticks have been upgraded to seeded flatbread (which I actually find quite addictive). The pasta is presented with slightly more flair and maybe even a bit more flavor. None of it is better than you could make at home buying ingredients from Fresh & Easy. The prices are high for the portions and particularly the quality that you are served. It is all passable and passionless.

It is rather popular, as there is not much that passes for fine dining in Gilbert. The food is by no means terrible and the servers are friendly, if forgetful. However, it does not compare well with an authentic passionate italian restaurant,"}
{"text":"Brio is a great option if you're at the Quarter looking for Italian. Plenty of outdoor seating in addition to their large dining room inside. I ordered the pasta alla vodka - ricotta filled pasta with a tomato cream sauce. Either my appetite is gigantic or the portions have been average at the Italian restaurants I've been to in the valley because I licked my plate clean. 

Entree prices range from $13-20."}
{"text":"I remember the Brio restaurant chain when it first opened more than 10 years ago and the food was really good. Unfortunately, the quality of the food has deteriorated over the years. it's just meh. The service is always good, and it's a busy place -- just wish the food was as good as it used to be back in 2006."}
{"text":"Came last minute for a bite to eat and it was brunch time. MImosa was good but no specials on drinks for brunch. My husband's omlette came out wrong and my daughter's cheeseburger was over cooked. However our server brought out 2 new dishes and really made up for the mistake! On a Sunday afternoon when they are busy, I can get over the mistake especially when they do their best to make it right. Carlos deserves 5 stars for that! Thank you."}
{"text":"So far, I've tried 3 out of the 118 Brio Tuscan Grille's.

I've tried their location in Alexandria, Virginia, which I previously reviewed (3/5 Stars), a couple visits to their location in Gilbert, Arizona (4/5 Stars), and was close to this location, and thought I'd try it.

On this occasion, I had a training class in the area, and wanted a quick bite. 

I had never been to this location, but I've enjoyed their other locations.

Although the decor is a little kitschy-over-the-top, I like it.

Everything I had was OUTSTANDING.

THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE

On this occasion, we wanted a girls only lunch, and we picked Brio Tuscan Grille in Gilbert, Arizona.

I had been to this location a number of times before, and thought it sounded great.

We had reservations, but we didn't really seem to need them, as the place was only 1/3 full.

Although the decor is a little kitschy-over-the-top, I like it. 

Our server, John, was super fun.

The drink menu has all sorts of specialty fruity drinks, so we ordered them all just to try them. My favorite was the watermelon martini. VERY TASTY INDEED. 

We split the mediterranean salad, the shrimp appetizer, and the calamari.

Everything we had was OUTSTANDING. 

CONCLUSION

{"text":"This place sucks big meatballs(see what I did there) service is bunk as hell. We sat there for 15 mins with no one helping us. So me and my party left. On our way out,We then told the manager what was going on and her response was on some half ass \"I'm sorry\", \"we can get you menus now\". She needs work on her managerial skills cause she seemed as if she doesn't have that.(she might need to take a class) Maybe it was because we didn't fit the \"look\" of her crowd. In any case, that's the first time and last time at that spot...just go to yard house for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I am sorry to report that I had a terrible experience here last night and it was my birthday!!!  It was 103 degrees outside and the front door was open.  The restaurant was hot,hot it must have been about 83 inside.  I asked the hostess to please turn the  air conditioner up and she told me that I was the only one complaining. How rude can you be.   Meanwhile I saw employees fanning themselves with menus.  She finally told me that she asked the manager and he said he would adjust the temperature to 68 and see if that helped.  CLOSE THE DOOR.  If you can't adjust your temperature you should close shop and move on.  We had already been seated and we did not want to relocate.  I was miserable and so was everyone else.  There are more polite places.  I must say the waiter was wonderful his name was Yanni.  I will stay away and suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not great either... this place has a really nice atmosphere & service isn't bad. However, it's overpriced to say the least. Not a great menu selection compared to pretty much any other restaurant of equivalent size/style. Overall I'd say this is more the type of place you go to when you're trying to enjoy a nice & impressive layout, as apposed to just getting a good solid meal & leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Just had a great brunch with hubby Howard at Brio Tuscan Grille in Scottsdale. Had their beef carpaccio. 
Large enough fo two with capers, special mustard and olive oil and forcaccio crackers. Fabulous and two great bloody Marys. The perfect Sunday light brunch for under $25. need I say try it!"}
{"text":"Have been to a Brio before and remembered it to be very good but no such luck last night. I had the Chicken Limon and we also had a double Pork Chop. The Chicken was dry, did not have any of the sauté sauce as would be usual, and had very little flavor. The vegetables it was served with were inedible. No idea what was wrong with them but bitter and terrible tasting. My partner only ate 1 of the 2 pork chops as he said that was not good either. Disappointing. The bread was good, the server was very nice and attentive ... only positives ... ahh well."}
{"text":"Had lunch with some friends that live in Summerlin area.  They said Brio is a mixed  bag, sometimes good, sometimes average...Service was good, food better than Olive Garden.  probably would not go back....."}
{"text":"Whoa, I enjoy this place. Never have I ever thought I would enjoy this place. Abby Q was a very pleasant server. I would recommend her to anyone who is trying to dine at this restaurant. Much gratitude!"}
{"text":"Stopped off here on a recommendation from a local. We were not dissapointed. It was delicious. The best brunch we have had in a long time."}
{"text":"M and I have eaten here many times over the years. We went back Thursday night so we could have dinner and then do some shopping in the mall. The menu has changed and I was sad to see the chicken and sweet potato risotto was gone from the menu. The free-range chicken they used was marvelous!
Anyway, now they have calorie counts on all their dishes listed on the menu and I LOVE that!  I was able to make a smart meal decision and it tasted really good. I had the Salmon Fresca. The portion size was so much better that I finished it without being stuffed or needing a to-go box. It came on a mix of chopped tomato, spinach and red bell pepper. M got the grilled chicken breast but wasn't that impressed. However, he made a lower calorie choice as well. 
The service has always been good there and we mostly sit in the bar. We used to go for happy hour food and drink, but now we can make better food choices."}
{"text":"You can't get any better than $2.95 special plates during happy hour!  The menu is small for happy hour, but the food is AMAZING !  
We had the Margharita Pizza, Steak Bruchetta and the Burger.  It was enough to fill our tummies.  The drinks we got weren't on happy hour, so we paid more for beer/ wine than food.  LOL.

I suggest sitting in the bar and trying out this happy hour.  It seemed popular, and the price can't get any better unless it is Freeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Brio Tuscan Grille.  I recently ate there with my husband and kids. The food was fantastic and, even though, the atmosphere indicates a more upscale restaurant, my kids were welcomed with no hesitation.  The chocolate dessert that I shared with my daughter was out of this world - so gooey and delicious.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It is rare that I have a dish that is unlike anything I have ever had...that makes me think I only wish I lived locally so I could have it again...but that is how I feel about the sweet potato and chicken risotto!.  It was extraordinary.  Fresh asparagus, pancetta, and pine nuts mixed in make it all just delicious- bite after bite.    And we dropped off our kids across the street at Safari Kid Care and all together it was a great vacation evening!!  Kids had fun, we ate well and had a nice short walk across the street to our car.  YUM."}
{"text":"I've typically gone to Brio for their happy hour ($3.95+ for small plates on weekdays), so I've never really gone here during regular lunch & dinner hours as I thought their prices were quite high.

However, I came here for lunch with my coworkers & I didn't realize they have a lunch menu (from $10 -$17), and their prices are very reasonable. It's not fast food cheap, but for its quality & ambience, it's definitely worth it.

Overall, servers have been nice & check up on my party in a timely manner. However the food takes a little longer to come out compared to other restaurants. Nonetheless, their complimentary bread & crackers satisfy one's appetite while waiting.

Honestly, everything on their menu is pretty tasty & delicious."}
{"text":"Sad day for me today service has never been bad today it was awful what's up brio I don't know how many people I've told about the great service there and today I got treated like a dog yesterday my bar tab was $17 and I left a $10 tip the same guy behind the bar was there they treated me like you didn't even know me we have gone there probably 25 times in the last 4 months oh well maybe we'll try one more time see if it gets any better"}
{"text":"We recently had our wedding reception here.  We are from Los Angeles and had never been to Brio Tuscan Grille so I didn't know what to expect.  The food was delicious and all my guests keep telling us how good the food was, how beautiful the restaurant was and how the location was perfect and so nice to get off the strip.  Everything went so well from booking to finish.  The staff is so amazing and so accommodating.  I can't thank everyone enough for making our wedding so perfect and easy.  P.S.- We had our reception on the outdoor patio and it is so pretty on its own that you don't need any decorations.  It's perfect."}
{"text":"Wow. What can I say? The place is boomin, so there was a short wait understandably, but only 15 minutes to seat 7 people? That's no time at all. The atmosphere, with the old paintings and Roman look, is great. I would decorate my place like that if I could. Next, the service. Our waitress' name was Kimberly, and she was great. Very attentive and a fantastic personality. She got a good tip for sure. Lastly, the food. Frickin fantastic. I had a mushroom ravioli with an alfredo sauce that knocked my socks off. I also tried the tortellini and lasagna that was also just as good. I would recommend this place to anyone, especially lovers of Italian food."}
{"text":"Yummy! Brio's bruschetta was soo good. I got the Bruschetta Quarto which featured four of their delicious bruschettas. I also tried their lobster bisque and the caesar salad. The salad was boring and lobster bisque came in a neat bowl, but had a weak flavor. For dessert I had the caramel creme brulee - very tasty! 

Brio is a loud restaurant - not a good place for conversation, but even with all the bustle and noise we still ended up having a great time."}
{"text":"Maybe it was just us (M and I) that had an very off and weird visit.  They told us that it will be 15 mins for a table.  Then they came back in 5 mins and said a private area is open & will sit us there.  Ok, they sat us on the patio.  Cool.  The heaters were on and I was melting, so we moved to another table.  

We were enjoying view and noticed the table we moved to was not cleaned yet.  OK, it was not dirty, it just had a used cloth napkin in the corner of the table.  We placed our order and talked.  Then I noticed a feather in M's hair.  I was like where have you been?  I removed it out of her hair.  When the appetizer and salad show up, M was pooped on by a dove.  YIKES!  I heard it was good luck?  She moved to the chair across the table.  When she sat, I noticed a fold white item underneath her chair.  I was like OMG, it is a maxi pad.  Where the heck did that come from?  

Here is the low down on the food and service:
Appetizer:  Pepperoni & Sausage Pizzetta - YUMMY!!!
Main course:  Chicken Milanese - Was pretty good, but not GREAT...
Main course:  Whole Roasted Chicken (M's meal, but I had some) - Flavor was good, but the chicken is DRY!
Dessert:  Chocolate caramel something - It was ok.
Service:  It was ok too."}
{"text":"Came here of a business dinner with my crew, and regretted this choice. Seemed like an over priced Olive Garden with tacky decor. Yikes!

Wish we went elsewhere."}
{"text":"My favorite thing about this place is their Happy Hour!  $3.95 food specials and now $5 drink specials (that's new it think)!  Can't beat that. The bar area does get very busy, and it's not that big, so be prepared to wait for a seat/table.  We have eaten there for lunch and dinner also and everything has always tasted amazing!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and ordered the chicken Marsala. It was amazing and the vegetables were fresh. I love grilled veggies. I wasn't disappointed at all and the service was great. Definitely will come here again"}
{"text":"Meh. Chain restaurant... 'nuff said.  8/6 visit.  None of the food was that good - I ordered the Balsamic Braised Beef Short Rib which was under-seasoned, bland and absent much flavor (er... saaaay Balsamic vinegar!?); my daughter ordered Pasta Alla Vodka which was slightly better.  Substantial portions, neither was worth taking home as left-overs.

The wine pour was mediocre.

Appitizer of Artichoke Dip was the star of the show; dessert of Dolchino Trio was great.

Server was friendly enough, but service sucked (disappearing for long periods of time; needing to be reminded of our requests numberous times - frankly I think he may have just had too many tables, despite the nearly 7p seating and a 1/3 full restaurant).

Hostess was wonderful, both being on the ball once we arrived; stewarding a late arrival back to our table; offering to charge my phone at the front when I was looking for an oulet.

Bigger price for an Olive Garden experience."}
{"text":"Always love coming here for happy hour, prices are awesome $5-$6 food and $4-$6 drinks! Happy indeed! Lol service is pretty great also, the workers are nice and makes sure that you got everything you need.

I just don't like how dark it is at night when you're dining inside it's a little hard to see, maybe just because I don't like to use my glasses but a little more light and it'd be great!"}
{"text":"Wonderful staff and amazing food. It's a bit loud if the restaurant is full but you forget all of it when you're served. Love it!"}
{"text":"This was me and my husband's first time eating here. I ordered a frozen alcoholic beverage (can't remember the name) but, it was amazing! I ordered the chicken lemon and my husband got the shrimp and lobster fettuccine! Both absolutely amazing, outside of our amazing food was the amazing service. Our server's name was Alex (aj) you could tell he really loved his job, the food, and I making our experience one of the best we would ever have! We will definitely be back and will be asking for the best server there, aj!"}
{"text":"I give Brio Cacina Italiana 4 stars simply because they deserve it!

Have frequented Brio Cacina Italiana many many times.  Have even celebrated my birthday here! Great fun!  What I love about the Brio is that they have a variety of dishes that I find delish!  From their Beef Carpaccio to their Eggplant & Shrimp appetizer to their perfect pasta! Just love them... if you go during the week, you can catch their Happy Hour & get the Beef Carpaccio for $2.95, baby! Yes, I said it! I went one early evening  for appies (appetizers) & drinks with my girlfriend and our bill was a mere $30 something when we finished! How can you beat that? We noshed on the Carpaccio, Shrimp cocktail and wine!  Also, the environment is great - I love chilling by the outside bar on the lovely spring / summer evenings... always a Gem in my book!

to be more up to date: Saturday, 29 Jan 2011 was date night - even tho our mood was less than nice... we still enjoyed our meal! :)

your constant companion,

{"text":"Great food, great happy hour. Five dollar martinis are killer. Gin with blue cheese stuffed olives , beef carpaccio appetizer , and chicken and quinoa for entree. Everything was so good, service was even better. Special thanks to bartender Diane and manager Cory for going well above and beyond what they needed to do to take care of me. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had in Vegas so far! Great service also. They are usually very busy, but it's well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great food in a fun, upscale atmosphere, but you can come here dressed in anything.   Restaurant can be loud, but you can still talk, so that is good.  The food was excellent, although the service was slow for our table of 6.  The restaurant was busy, but our server seemed overloaded.  All the food we ordered was great, though and everything we saw that went by looked yummy."}
{"text":"As good as it gets.We're in town for the Drags and staying near this area. Our server Frank was friendly, informative and efficient. The food was delicious and presented well. The Salmon fresca was absolutely delicious. The chopped and wedge salad both had a perfect combination of ingredients and dressing. We plan on eating there again tomorrow. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I started visiting Brios about 7 years ago and fell in love with anything and everything they put in front of me.  I'm afraid the love affair isn't what it used to be.  Tonight was a deal breaker for me.  The steak salad used to be exceptional.  Unfortunately, the quality and recipe has changed over the years.  I think this evening may very well be my last order.  It's very sad and disappointing.   I don't know whether the restaurant is looking to cut corners and save money or whether a change in chefs over the years may be behind the changes, but overall it's not the same restaurant I grew to love.

We ordered through Door Dash this evening.  Delivery was late but we are talking about Valentines Day. . . so they deserve a bit of slack here.  When the salads arrived, we noticed right away that the lettuce looked more like what you'd expect to find in a buffet added as an afterthought to a taco. . .chopped up into very small pieces and very light in color.  Not much nutritional value.  Looked more like scraps than a nice mix of romaine and other types of lettuce thrown into the mix.  I'm not sure I understand why the pieces were so small unless they really are scraps. Sarcasm aside. . .The dressing recipe has changed considerably.  Unfortunately, that's what really added the WOW factor to the meal back in the day.  You honestly could not find better.  The small containers of dressing that they did send was about 2/3 full. . .barely enough for a third of the salad provided.  We wound up digging in the fridge for additional dressing just to finish the salad.  I'd like to say that there was enough to at least hint at the taste of dressing, but that would be a stretch.  Walnuts were nearly non existent as well.  I will say that the steak was cooked to perfection, but that's about it.  Two salads delivered came to just over 51 dollars with roughly 20 coming from taxes, fees, delivery and tip.  We would have been happier driving through Jack in The Box for one of their salads and saved a few bucks. 

Very sad. . .I'm in mourning.  :0("}
{"text":"I typically shy away from chain Italian especially in Vegas but Brio is always a favorite for a casual meal with great food. I love their beef carpaccio, the presentation is awesome, it's like boat of beef. I enjoyed the chicken and quinoa salad. The chicken was a little cold and overdone, but it totally satisfied my cravings. I love their bread too, for some reason it's so addicting. The service was nice, cook time on the food was a little long especially for a party of 6 (mostly salads), but I love the environment and the parking is easy."}
{"text":"Had a meal here yesterday afternoon about 3:30-ish with my daughter as we had $10-off coupons for lunch entrees.  I have to agree with another reviewer, the prices are truly out of line.  $14.95 for a lunch entree is ridiculous.  I had the blackened tilapia with the side of seasonal vegetables and, while the fish was just luscious, the veggies could have used some more time in the steamer, particularly the carrots.  When will the chefs learn that carrots take longer to cook than zucchini?

Since I was driving, I avoided alcohol and ordered a cranberry juice and soda with lime.  The first one came in a tall glass with the lime on the lip so I could squeeze it if I wishes.  When I asked for a refill, the bartender chose that time to take a break, so the other waitress (not ours) went behind the bar to prepare another one, which she put into a wine  glass and squeezed the lime herself.  Consistency, thy name is NOT Brio Tuscan Grille.  

My daughter had the Mediterranean Shrimp and said it was very good - I had a small bite of shrimp and it was quite spicy/bitey, but good.  She said that she has eaten at this location several times and has never had a bad meal -  I'll take her word for it. 

The food was good, I think I would rather have sat at a table than at a high-top in the bar, as we were witness to a couple of not-so-nice remarks from one waitress to the other.  I think they need a lesson in how to behave around customers.

Since I don't live in this area. I probably won't be back.  If I lived here, I probably wouldn't be back anyway.

AND I STILL WANT TO KNOW WHY EVERY DAMNED RESTAURANT WITH A BAR AREA TRIES TO BE A SPORTS BAR!!!!!!  Turn off the televisions and let the music play."}
{"text":"Me and my friend decided to try out brio at the quarter on Sunday very disappointed on the service we asked for one thing and the waiter brings something else after two hrs. The  food was nothing special, I will not recommend......"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time Monday night for a birthday dinner of a friend. The service was fantastic don't remember his name but looked like a young Charlie Sheen.  Answered all questions on our meals and they were delicious.  Compliments to the chef and his team. Will tell people to come to your great restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Called in an order was told 15 min so I waited 10 before driving giving 25-30min time I understand it's busy dinner hour on a Friday. 
When I walk in the hostess is polite tell her I'm here to pick up etc.. she takes my cash money says I'll be right back going to grab the food... now this is where we start going wrong.. their are to go orders in the corner but I don't say anything, she comes back says it's almost done perfect!.... 10 min go by 2 people who ordered amazon come and go me on the other hand nothing, so I ask excuse me  any info on that order she asks me was it on amazon... I just gave you cash and you said my food was almost done how And why are we talking about amazon. She says the manager is taking care of it so it will be another 10 min! Nope I ask for my money back she has the nerve to ignore me go sit a table. I keep asking for my money without becoming angry because it's just food but ALL OF SUDDEN. My food appears no manager (even tho he came up looked at me and walked back) NEVER AGAIN BRIO SORRY SERVICE !!!"}
{"text":"just ate lunch there. super good and highly recommended. the food was delicious, the service was wonderful and the environment was very appropriate. the filet is delicious. as well as the shrimp on eggplant, and I HATE shrimp. the desserts were good too. try to get in chris' section, he was probably one of the best servers I've ever had."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a late lunch today and really enjoyed it. The bread, soup and lasagna were incedible. The service was perfect.  Had a great time."}
{"text":"I love this place their choice selection for italian food and pasta is great! I came for happy hour, and I tell you their happy hour really makes you happy! they have a $2.95 happy hour menu for your basic appetizers, finger foods, and a regular sized burger. Although they don't have a happy hour menu for drinks. I think the over all quality of the food makes up for it all. The BRIO burger is awesome, and definitely a steal for the price! The buns are toasted, and the meat is so tender and juicy. Full of flavor! We also ordered a bunch of chorizo fonduta. I would highly reccomend that along with their margherita flatbread. You will definitely get full fast, and still have some left over!"}
{"text":"Brio Is just one of THE BEST places to go for happy hour! You sure do get your fillings with only ordering all their Tuscan Tasters. I mean $3.95 appetizers and $5 martinis, sangria, and wine? How could you beat that? You'd really have to decide which would come first, a food coma or a drunken state.

My personal faves here are the Beef Carpacio, Ravioli Caprese, and the Eggplant. For the drink specials-it's all about the Peach Sangria, and the Mojito. Best believe they don't hold back on the alcohol either!

Also, their angus burger which is also on the happy hour menu is definitely a double BANG for your buck. I took my aunts here for happy hour and just got a kick out of it1 They loved the decor, and the ambiance, and most of all they loved that they were full off of yummy appetizers. 

Our server was also very helpful and friendly. She even went out of her way to separately send out our dishes so we weren't overwhelmed with food. Not like thats a bad thing or anything!

I will crave you again soon Brio."}
{"text":"As many of you already know, Tivoli Village has a ton of great restaurants. Brio Tuscan Grille is one of those restaurants. Their great food and other awesome features certainly set Brio apart from many restaurants.

Brio's food was 10/10! My friends and I ordered 9 different plates including 3 kids items. There was not a single dish that we weren't satisfied with. We ordered 2 appetizers and 4 different main dishes. I cannot remember the exact names, but we ordered a variety of items in different categories. Everything from salad and pasta to seafood and steak. All dishes tasted very fresh and well-put-together. Even their kids items were impressive. They had better selections for kids than most other restaurants. We also had some of their mix drinks, and they were good as well. Absolute 10/10!!

The service could not be any better either. The server was very kind and friendly. He knew the entire menu by heart and gave us great suggestions. The drinks that he recommended went well with the food too. I especially liked his friendliness to the kids.

The atmosphere was elegant, yet comfortable. The noise level was not high, but it was not uncomfortably quiet. 
 
Brio Tuscan Grille is one of my favorite restaurants in Summerlin now!"}
{"text":"Brio is a great place for lunch not too busy, dinner on a weekend you may have to wait.They do alot right, I don't have anything negative to say. 

Free WiFi also..(hope they still have it) 

Brio bakes and cooks most things in house so everything is fresh, You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  I love the smoke chicken sandwich, and pasta's at Brio.
Very comfortable setting and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and couldn't be more pleased. Great service, great decor, great food and an exceptional Bellini. 

The soup of the day was tomato bisque and it was the 2nd best tomato bisque I've ever had, just delicious. I had the lunch special, Mezza Chicken with mashed potatoes and roasted vegi's and it was good, 4 stars.
The 5th star was for the amazing peach Bellini and tomato bisque. The next time I am in Vegas, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I have experienced in Arizona and I was surprised because it's a chain. My guy and I were ooing and ahhing throughout the meal. I had the Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli with Crab insalata and it was a perfect portion, perfect flavoring and al dente! AMAZING. The only thing this place needs is Spumoni (minus the candied fruit)!!! Our server didn't even know what it was! What? i know!"}
{"text":"We go to this Brio all the time because it's more convenient for our family get together. Food is always good but the service can be improved on. They seem to get our orders wrong and do watch out for the bill and double check. There has been several occasions that we got charged for more things than we should. But the kids love the food and we don't have a choice when they choose this place. Maybe the Summerlin location has given us a better experience in the past..."}
{"text":"Perfection!  Bartender Ken, General Manager Joe and the entire staff provided us with an incredible experience. Friendly, well trained and very efficient. Then comes the food-- we had the  shrimp lobster ravioli and the Mediterranean Shrimp. Both were exquisite!  We will be back, maybe tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Although, I like Olive Garden...Brio is definitely a step above

I got the Pasta Brio to go & it was so delicious! The dish had roasted red pepper sauce over rigatoni with grilled chicken & mushrooms. It was very flavorful & not heavy  pasta dish.

I also got the chocolate cake & it was also a winner! It was rich with flavor yet, it was still light."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but it's on my list to visit again next time I'm in Vegas. 

It has been quite a while since my visit, I wasn't even going to review, but there is a dish that is still on my mind, even today, so I feel it's worth a shout out. The best thing we ate here was the roasted grapes. My folks kind of looked at me cross-eyed when I ordered it, but it is easily one of the best dishes I have ever had. My parents still talk about it. This dish was perfectly executed. The texture and flavor of these sweet little gems was so delightful, I forgot where I was and went savage with my fingers. I just could not get enough. 

All of our food was very very good. I'd give 5 stars, but our service was lackluster. Not sure if someone called out or our server was just not good, but we seldom saw him very and when he did stop by, he wasn't very helpful. 

Despite that, Brio is a beautiful restaurant with great food that will be a pleasure to visit again."}
{"text":"I've been to the Happy Hour twice in one week!  This is a really great HH, but let me warn you, it's a girly HH.  Because as my husband said, \"There's nothing but martinis and mojitos on this damn drink list!\"  It's true, 95% of the menu is sugary and girly concoctions, but sometimes I like me a good lemon drop!

Opinions on the drinks:
The drinks are nicely made and tasty and they're all only $5.  My favorite is one of the special ones they have on Wednesdays that is like a lemon drop with basil.  The sangria rosa is better than the white peach sangria.  The strawberry mojito tastes like fresh strawberries.  The red wine is a good, dry one.

Opinions on the food:
This is the money maker right here.  During HH, they have a special food list where everything is $3.95.  My husband and I ordered a hamburger to share.  Wowza, when it came out, it was like the size of a Carl's Jr. burger and it came with homemade potato chips.  What, what, what?  This whole thing is only $4?  And it was a delicious hamburger with melted provolone cheese and a zingy little secret sauce.  The gentleman next to us ordered the spicy crispy shrimp and a sausage flatbread, both of which were also generously sized for the $4 pricetag.  When I went with my friend, we ordered the ravioli caprese.  Very tasty, but it only comes with 3 ravioli.  Come on...you give out a huge burger and chips, but only 3 ravioli?  I was a little disappointed in that.  We also ordered the shrimp and eggplant which has a really nice smoky sauce to it.

It does get crowded during the HH, and sometimes you have to wait a while to get the bartender's attention, but that is what you have to expect when it's a great HH.  My advice: get there around 3:30 so you can find a seat and put an order in before the rush!"}
{"text":"There are many things that come to my mind when I think of Brio.  Interesting food, great quality, elegant atmosphere and friendly service.  But one thing has stood out recently since I have gone there and that is, $2.95 appetizers in the bar until 6pm.  When you think something is $2.95, you probably think it is either a small portion, not good or both of these things.  Well it is neither of these things.  The appetizers are generous portions and great tasting with several selections to choose from.  I want to just make it easy and say to the waiter, I'll have one of each please.  I love a good cheeseburger and the Brio Bistecca Burger is definitely my favorite right now.  It comes on a tasty bun with mozzarella cheese and is served with well done potato chips...yum!  You don't even get messy eating it because they cut it into quarters for you.  The bruschetta is also easy to eat because you can just pick it up and bite it.  They have two different kinds on the happy hour menu.  Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta with fresh basil and a balsamic drizzle and Sliced Steak Brushetta with Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano and Tuscan Italian dressing.  There is also a Margherita Flatbread that is prepared with Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil cooked in an authentic Italian wood-burning oven.  I don't eat calamari but my friends ordered the Calamari Fritto Misto which was fried to a crisp golden brown with peperoncini and they liked it.  This is probably just either half or less than half of what they offer for $2.95.  I still haven't tried either shrimp appetizers or the eggplant appetizer.  The Beef Carpaccio served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and fresh Parmesan cheese looks excellent as well.  Tuscan culinary creations are perfected at Brio.  If you decide to go, please save me a seat in the bar.  As you can imagine, they go rather quickly.  Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I like the Brio. It's really a nice venue and they have great outdoor patio seating. Also, their entrées are a cut above for an upscale fast casual restaurant, and their prices are reasonable. The entrées on my previous visits have been consistently good. Not so much on my latest visit. I ordered the Ham & Biscuit Benedict, $10.50 off the Brunch Menu. It consists of two poached cage free eggs, Cherrywood smoked ham, housemade biscuit and hollandaise, served with brunch potatoes. First, I was disappointed in the fact that my breakfast was not hot and was served cold. Bottom line, hot food should be served hot. The Cherrywood smoked ham had no flavor due to it being over cooked, as a result it was tough and chewy. Likewise, the house made biscuit was hard as a rock. On my previous visit their brunch potatoes were a big hit with everyone. This time they were over seasoned and very salty. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hollandaise was good. Two other people in our party had the same entrée and made same or similar comments. Service was great. Our server was friendly and attentive. In closing, I recommend the Brio. However, I do not recommend this entrée."}
{"text":"Simply put, I have never had a bad experience coming here. I've come here for happy hour, for dinner, for lunch, and I've even been to their Sunday brunch.

One Word: Amazing

My parents actually attended the soft opening and they told me that I HAD to come to Brio. Best advice my parents may have ever given me. I've come here for my last 2 birthday and that's a pretty high honor in my family. 

The best part of Brio is that there is really something for everyone and for every food mood. When I'm feeling pasta I order the Pasta Alla Vodka or the Mushroom Ravioli. When I want to eat healthy I order one of their amazing salads (hint: their balsamic is delicious!!!). When I want meat i get their Mezza Chicken \"under a brick\"

One of the best things about Brio is their desserts. They offer some large \"full size\" desserts and they offer little dessert shots. There are some desserts that they always have, but they also add new ones from time to time. I appreciate the variety the offer.

Everyone I've taken here has loved it and I will swear by this restaurant"}
{"text":"I have only been here for happy hour but tonight we decided to sit down for dinner and I'm glad we did.  We had some of the most amazing food.  I highly recommend the gluten free chicken pesto.  We had amazing service with Kirsten so if you get a chance ask for her."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Went on Mother's Day and the good and service was excellent! They went above and beyond and we enjoyed our experience. We will be back! Some of the best food in San Tan Village."}
{"text":"I've been going to brio for quite some time, and i really like this place. Beautiful patio, good service, and great food would describe it all. My friends and i are regulars already!"}
{"text":"We decided to go there for lunch as my wife had a work outing there and enjoyed the food.  The restaurant was less than a quarter full and the waitress was friendly.  The food was decent (calimari, lobster bisque and salads) and the portion sizes were fine.  I was just puzzled why it would take over 30 minutes to receive our salad orders and soup.  Since the restaurant was empty I did not expect to wait that long for a rather simple order.  We then had to wait over 15 minutes to pay.  My final impression of my experience was having 3 hostesses (or waitresses) hanging out by the front door gossiping and ignoring me."}
{"text":"I've been to brio at town square and selected items are good.  Others not so much.   I was totally turned off by just coffee and dessert here.  Coffee want memorable and cheesecake was old and disgusting.    Our server was coughing up a lung and should have been sent home 

I am giving it two stars just because my experience at the other location was ok.  Otherwise it would not even get two!"}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch happy hour and I have to say that Brio maybe possibly have the best happy hour I've ever had! The food portions are very large, the prices are great, and the service was phenomenal! Our waitress (I believe her name was Mary, short reddish brown ponytail) was so sweet, she constantly had a smile on her face and was so attentive even though she was very busy. So excited to have discovered this happy hour and my boyfriend and I are looking forward to coming back as soon as possible! Thanks Brio"}
{"text":"Brio is a typical chain restaurant.  Everything is pretty consistent but nothing stands out.  I had lobster bisque which was way too salty and carpaccio which was fine.  Lunch service was quick in and out."}
{"text":"Great try.... Missed the mark (but worth a second look)

My wife and I tried Brio on the recommendation of a friend.  When we arrived we were greeted by an overly perky hostess who directed us to our table.  The place is decorated like a Coppola film, red velvet sashes and all.  

Earlier, we had a heavy lunch so my wife and I opted to just share a couple of appetizers.  While reviewing their menu I noticed they had one of my favorites, carpaccio.  If you are not familiar with Carpaccio, it's super thin shaved beef loin seved with mustard aioli and some sort of cracker or toast points.  (If you want EXCELLENT carpaccio, go get it at Fleming's - it's the BEST carpaccio)  So, I ordered the Carpaccio and my wife ordered the \"Chef's Seasonal Bruschetta\" which is described a \"Housemade, using the finest and freshest ingredients\".  

After we ordered I had to remind the waitress that we had ordered drinks from her earlier and that we would still like to have them.  Aside from having to wait 10 minutes for our drinks, they were very good.  My wife had a pomegranate martini and i had a slightly dirty gin martini.  

Our food arrived shortly after our drinks.   As the wait staff  presented our food, i had to insist they bring us silverware and couple napkins.  

The first thing that i noticed was the portions were huge!  The next thing i noticed was that the Bruschetta my wife ordered was sizzling - as in it just came out of the oven.  The bruschetta was actually 7 little sausage pizzas.  They were very tasty and I did enjoy them, but it was not bruschetta made with \"the freshest\" ingredients.  

The carpaccio was disappointing.  The meat that was used was not as good as it could have been, it was overly salted and the aioli was overpowering.  Additionally the over-sized portion came with 3 large crackers, not nearly enough (had i wanted to eat the entire portion).

I was underwhelmed with my first visit.  I will have to return as my friends tell us that we just \"ordered wrong\" and need to go back...  I guess will as i will try anything twice."}
{"text":"Great service and food. Highly recommended and perfect casual lunch and dinner place for everyone."}
{"text":"When I walked in I felt like I was in a restaurant in the Venetian or Balaggio hotel. Realy nice and the host staff and waiters gave the best service you cuould possibly get. I ordered the homemade tortellini stuffed with a ricotta mixture covered in a pink vodka sauce. The dish was right on, 5 stars for this dish alone. I only wish there were a few more tortellini cause i could have eaten them till i exploded. Anyway dad got the pork chops topped with gorgonzola . He loved them. My mom and girlfriend got the steak topped with hollidaise. They both liked that but the steaks were over done a bit. They had a huge party they served before us and think our steaks were forgotten about and were a little over cooked. We told the waitress and they took both dishes off the bill and gave us free dessert. We got the dessert sampler and molten lava cake. Freakin unreal desserts. I will be back I would have given them 3 stars cause of the over cooked steaks but they made up for that in a big way and I will be back."}
{"text":"Dined at Brio last night with my husband to celebrate our anniversary. When we checked in with the hosts, they asked us if we were celebrating anything and we informed them of our anniversary and they congratulated us and made us feel like we were royalty. They sat us in a nice big booth, so big we could have had other diners join us! I ate the Gorgonzola medallions and let me tell you, they were AMAZING! The meat was so tender and tasty my mouth is watering just talking about it. My husband ordered the Lobster and shrimp fettuccine and he loved it, he cleaned the plate off. the manager kiya (im sorry if i chopped that up) came up to our table while we were eating our entrees and checked on us and made sure everything was on point and she also congratulated us for our special occasion. Our waiter Pedro was one of the best servers ive ever had! He was attentive to us the moment we sat down, friendly, and made sure we had a great experience. The atmosphere at brio is lovely and comfortable. Im glad we decided to go to brio to celebrate, we definitely plan on going back very soon. Thank you Brio!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!!! The Salmon salad is superb. They have gluten free menu, great wine, great variety of foods that are all delicious! Desserts are worth saving room for!

They also have a frequent buyer app which is awesome! $10 off after first visit & discounts after every few meals.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, nice decor. A little on the pricey side but overall a very nice place for dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've eaten here a few times now and there is not one thing that has not been above standard. When ever we are not sure where to go out to dinner this is our go to place. just love it!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place, and tonight my love grew even stronger. Although it's rather loud inside (and hot outside!) I was able to have a great business meeting where I could hear my partners well. Had the lobster with crab and pasta, mmmmmmm!! Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"We have come to Brio's on several occasions and each time we've had a very pleasant experience. The food is consistent and good. I guess we have been lucky with our service because it's always been great. Or maybe it's just Jermaine...

I will say you will be hard pressed to find something else worthwhile at San Tan Village. I guess there are those who settle for Panera and Chipotle.

All in all this a great spot and we will be back"}
{"text":"Personally my experience was awesome,  the food is really good,  they doesn't have a lot of wines for be a place with an Italian name and serves pasta,  the wine's menu is not so extended."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My husband and I came here after our wedding ceremony with our group of 29 people. There were a couple more people than we had anticipated. I felt awful because we had to ask for more table space for an already large party. But the staff was on it. They were so understanding, and when we apologized, told us not to because it was our special day and we shouldn't be sorry for anything. They were so accommodating and gracious. And the food was amazing. The lobster bisque was phenomenal. My best friends husband hates seafood, and even he loved it. I also have a friend who's vegan; they  crafted a dish just for her. My sister-in-law has a shellfish allergy, and they accommodated that without hesitation as well. By far some of the best service I've ever had at a restaurant, and the food was beyond worth every penny. So delicious!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Brio in Tivoli Village since it opened. It's the place we bring the many guests that come to visit us in Las Vegas and they always tell us we made a great selection in choosing Brio. We recently went to Brio with friends from Florida. From the moment we were seated we were impressed with the attentiveness of our server Bre, the presentation and flavor of the food.  Our guests were raving about the service we received and the beautiful atmosphere . Having spent several years in Italy during my military career, I know excellent Italian food when I taste it and Brio has it all together. A nice  touch was added by Brio Manager Prado who stopped by to ask if we were satisfied with our service and food. With so many restaurants in the surrounding area to choose from, there is little wonder why we choose Brio when we are looking for an exceptional night out"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Had a nice lunch with my aunt and the food was delish. I had the pasta pesto which was to die for and the portion was just right. My aunt had the Caesar salad and margarita pizza which I tried and was yummy. Service was good and seating was roomy."}
{"text":"This was my third time at Brio in Scottsdale. The quality of the food has taken a nose dive. 
We were a party of 5. My pasta dish was served warm - not hot. The side kale salad was mediocre - at best, One of my friends ordered a pasta dish with chicken. It was served without the chicken (Hello). My guess is that the chef has never had real Italian food. They seated us a the only table in the (fairly empty) restaurant on which the sun continued to shine. So my friend had to keep shifting her chair around the table to avoid being blinded by the glare. Sadly, I was the one who recommended Brio, as it was my birthday. I must say that the dessert was delicious. The waiter was attentive, but he should have moved us to another table. Disappointed BIG TIME."}
{"text":"Sorry....but this place was an utter failure.

I know all places have bad nights but there were too many issues from different parts of the house to ignore.

First..and foremost..the waiter. Careless..and almost like he didn't give a rats ass we were there cause he deserved a tip anyways.

My wife asked for the a pasta dish and NO mushrooms...of course it came out with mushrooms. Mother in law ordered the steak with veggies and mashed potaotes. Whoever was on the line was horrible. Veggies and mashed potatoes were ice cold and never should have left the kitchen. Another order of the fish was a letdown with over cooked and dried out fish.

Come on..the line failed, the person on the gill failed, and the server was a joke. Another example of over trendy and overhyped Summerlin crap."}
{"text":"We love this place....great pasta dishes and we love the ambiance!"}
{"text":"Latest visit was pretty awful.

Came here for lunch one afternoon with a coworker and there was a huge line of people waiting to be seated. Luckily we had reservations and so we were taken to our table. We each ordered an entree, since I'm part of the restaurant's loyalty rewards program I get discounts and promotions in my inbox regularly, I was informed by the staff that I couldn't use my promotion due to some weird random company policy. 

The prices have increased significantly in the last 6 months, AND the food quality has definitely gone downhill. The chicken dish I got was rather stiff and over cooked. Service seemed very absent, and not very friendly. 

Really really disappointing, and I will very likely cancel my account and never set foot here again."}
{"text":"My family and I love brios food, but the service is awful every single time. Making the restaurant unbearable to visit even though it is one of our favorites"}
{"text":"The pasta brio is absolutely delicious. Always consistent regardless of the location."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a decent Italian place, Brio is one to check out! Located just South of the Strip, Town Square is a great place to relax, hang out, and shop. The ambiance of the restaurant is relaxed and quiet and put together very well. Their outside eating area is huge and borders the restaurant along a couple of walkways for pedestrians. It's a really nice place to relax and enjoy your meal.

I've had quite a few dishes here. The lasagna is great as is the lobster bisque. I've never had a problem with quality or taste here. They also have a great wine selection to pair with your meal.

They're service has always been on par and friendly. This is a great place to have business meetings or to take business persons you want to have an intimate and business-friendly meal with.

The restaurant can get quite busy during the holidays so make sure you have a reservation in place before you head here."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good. The music is a bit loud for conversation. The pasta with Vodka sauce was creamy without losing the marinara flavors. The chefs special of Braised Beef Pappardella was excellent. The long ribbons of Rosemary infused pasta paired well with the braised beef. The beef fell apart with each bite. Nice offering from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Three of us just went to Brio this last Sunday to take my mother-in-law out for her birthday. It was my suggestion to go there because I have enjoyed it in the past. I ordered the chicken marsala because that is a standard I like to order when I go to an Italian restaurant. How disappointing! I received what looked like a prepackaged grilled chicken breast with a small amount of marsala sauce on it and beside it. The chicken was so highly seasoned with herbs and tasted like oregano that it was so out of place in this meal. If they aren't going to make it from scratch they should at least cook a plain chicken breast in a garlic butter sauce not oregano! I never expected this to happen at an Italian restaurant like Brio. I spoke to the manager and made it clear that I wasn't trying to complain but just to ask questions about how they normally prepare this. I thought for sure they had run out of their usual chicken and substituted this instead. He said that's how they make it. I saw another review from 2013 which said something very similar to my post. Crocker Park has other options for dinner so I'll probably go elsewhere in the future or at least not make it my suggestion to choose Brio. They took the marsala off my bill which I didn't ask for but which was appreciated. The manager also said I could have asked for the chicken to be prepared plain. I didn't think I had to tell them how to prepare chicken marsala it is such a standard Italian dinner item. Olive Garden has a very good chicken marsala and I thought I was going to get something similar here."}
{"text":"Would have liked to try the food here but we wait at least 20 mins for someone to come & take our orders (& this was just drinks) the people that got seated after us were already getting bread & appetizers. & still no one approached our table, even though my aunt made eye contact with some of the waiters who still probably couldn't get the hint that we we're obviously waiting for someone to take our order. Of course we just left & just went for Yard House. Disappointing for a nice restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing: optimistic, results-oriented, curious, innovative, and adaptable people work here and make excellent suggestions on food. I always get the best service and food here. Our friend complemented the Moscow mule made by Sara: very sweet and talented bar tender. The manager is pleasant as can be and booths are ambient and comfy. Thanks Brio and keep doing amazing work on pleasing our taste buds"}
{"text":"Brio has great service and very friendly staff. The food quality is a bit inconsistent depending on what day you visit. It's a great family place and the portions are large so expect to have leftovers."}
{"text":"Bartenders John and Chris were awesome! Super professional staff that makes you feel so welcome. If you have any questions these are the guys to ask! The restaurant was very accomodating to my Celiac (gluten intolerance) with yummy GF pasta. 10/10 will come back!"}
{"text":"I'm glad there are so many great reviews here.  Too bad mine won't be one of them.  Went there for brunch and I ordered the Ham & Biscuit Benedict.  The only thing warm on the plate was the hollandaise sauce and even then it was barely warm.  I would have liked to have told the server that everything was cold but, sadly, she didn't bother to check back to see how everything was.  I don't know when the potatoes or asparagus were prepared but I'm not even certain that they were made the same day.  Tasted like leftovers that I could pull out of my own refrigerator.  Maybe it's that particular dish that they don't prepare very well but I did not enjoy my meal or the service.  Atmosphere is nice though."}
{"text":"Tried the Bruschetta Quattro...SO GOOD. I only got the Brio Chopped Salad because I was full, however my husband got the Gorgonzola Crusted Bistecca - PERFECTION. So moist, succulent and ;....I'm drooling. Best ever. My BIL ordered what I wanted originally, Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. AH-MAZING! So flavorful and innovative. The BIL's gf (haha I love acronyms) needed gluten free dishes only and the server was most accommodating. Actually, the service was the best I've had in years. Overall the ambiance is in a beautiful setting in a 'strip mall' look of Town Center, but I am now craving for the bistecca and live no where near a Brio :( Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from here twice now and both times have been full of noms. However, it's a little pricey for my expectations--I don't think they are probably using any higher quality ingredients than Macaroni Grill, Olive Garden, or Maggiano's, but it seems to be quite a bit more expensive.

Yesterday I had a lunch combo... a half salad and a small portion of risotto. The risotto was really great with a lot of veggies (squash, asparagus, tomatoes) and pine nuts. What's not to love about that? The side caesar was good too, and the combination of the two filled me up without being too heavy of a lunch (even though it was a generous portion of creamy risotto!). 

I would love to go back and not have it for takeout--I'd like to experience the food fresh out of the kitchen instead out of plastic to-go boxes. However, it is a good option for takeout in Town Square!"}
{"text":"Tasty brunch / lunch of shrimp & grits with a perfectly poached egg. Our waiter Kelvin was very nice. He did great at keeping drinks full & was present as often as possible without being obnoxious. Overall great visit."}
{"text":"Great cocktail menus and a go-to place for my friends and I when we visit Las Vegas.  Happy hour is a great deal, but you can only enjoy the deals in the bar. 

They have a new option on their menu where you can order 2, 3, or 4 small dishes of appetizers or side dishes for a decent prize.  Although listed as a small dish, the size and portion is more than enough for a group of 3.  

Best thing I've had here and a must for anyone to order is the spicy shrimp with the crusted eggplant.  So delicious and flavorful!  One bite, you'll want to eat the whole dish.  Not too spicy but definitely full of mouth-drooling flavor.  

Their brussel sprouts and caprese salad is also delicious as well.  Something I'd definitely order again. 

From their cocktails, I got the Cucumber Basil Gimlet with the Hendricks Gin.  Very refreshing and great palate cleanser as well.  Their sangrias are also decent as well.  

Service is great and no complaints there."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Their happy hour is definitely one of my top picks in Las Vegas. The quality and portion of the items on the HH menu are very well worth your money considering they start from $5. You must try the beef carpaccio, period. You definitely will not be disappointed and you'll probably order more than one. Another favorite is the Bruschetta Trio, very flavorful and savory!
Aside from the food, the inside and outside is really comfortable and sleek so it makes it easier to stay there for a good amount of time."}
{"text":"This place has a nice ambience and has a classy feel to it. We started our meal with a Calamari Fritto Misto which was delicious fried Calamari! They're bread was pretty special, one was made like a \"pizza\" shaped fried bread with spices on it.  We ordered a Lobster Bisque that was very tasty as well. My girlfriend ordered the Campanelle Carbonara which had grilled chicken, bacon, Parmesan cheese, spinach and Alfredo, it was done very well. I ordered the Pasta Mediterranean which had grilled chicken, mushrooms, feta cheese, spinach and tomatoes in it. So good! Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Let me say I come to Brio especially because of their super delicious tomato bisque I can't get enough of! My only wish is that they served it more often during the week and on weekends, and not only on Tuesdays, a weekday when I rarely go because it's about 40 minutes from where I live and weekdays are always super busy. I also love their beef carpaccio, it's amazing and a must-have. It's all I ever eat (plus the soup) when we go there. Service may be slower sometimes but we keep entertained and fed with their great bread. Brio is one of my faves but please make the tomato bisque available more often!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best happy hours around. Just be there early to get a seat and if you're at the bar you may be sat a bit close to another customer. The food here is good and the cocktails are well made. My main criticism is the service. It really is one of the worst of places I've been to for slow service. The last 2 times I went, I waited over 40 minutes for my class of wine and the other time it took so long to get the menu that we nearly walked out. They really need to step up their game with the service here, otherwise this place would be fantastic."}
{"text":"I really only want to give 3.5 stars.  Went last night for happy hour.  There were 9 of us.  The food was awesome!  Really loved the black pepper shrimp and the burger!!  The busser was attentive as well!!  Unfortunately the waiter seemed to not be very interested in taking care of us.  I specifically told him when there were only 3 of us there that I wanted what I ordered to be on a separate check that would be brought to me.  At the end of the evening I asked for my bill only to be told that it was all on one.  He then stated he hadn't heard me.  Did say that he would handle it but then STILL brought a single check.  Had to ask for bread three separate times which was finally brought by the bus boy.  We will be back ONLY because the food was really hood but will hopefully get a different waiter!!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my \"last fling before the ring!\"  Not only was the food fanastic, but without us even requesting, they put us in a private area away from the rest of the diners and gave us a wonderful server, Danny, who took care of everything we could possibly need.  It was a great way to spend my bachelorette weekend with all my of closest friends!"}
{"text":"I normally have a great experience when I come here, not this time.   The food was not up to it's normal standards and we had to send a dish back because it was cold.  They changed the noodles to a sticky so called angel hair..  If it ain't broken don't fix it.  Service was slow and he forgot to bring a salad to one of our guests.   I miss the old Brio and will give it one more chance hoping it was just a off night for the staff."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience with my friend. Roy was our server. Honestly, I wish I could give him 100 stars. This guy is awesome, friendly, and chill. Got he wedge salad; and lobster bisque. IF YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THIS RESTAURANT and another one (Tommy Bahamas) CHOOSE BRIO.!! Lol you won't be disappointed. We were sat out on the patio. Beautiful weather. Busy night. Good vibes. Servers time management was on point. TRY THE PEACH BELLINI!! Yass"}
{"text":"Perfect place for date night or after a long week at work or a get together with some of your friends. Ambiance is casual but can get loud when it gets crowded. I made reservations online and got seated right away when we got there. I noticed some people who were waiting to be seated had to wait a little longer than those with reservations. It pays off to plan ahead!

Me & my boyfriend started off sharing a the chopped salad, which was tasty but would have liked a little more.

For my entree I got the shrimp Mediterranean, very nice presentation. It was grilled shrimp over a bed of orzo and assorted veggies, all super tasty and the portion was just right for me. 

For dessert we shared a snicker doodle peach cobbler that was topped with vanilla ice cream. It was sweet & fruity, nothing short of satisfaction.

I want to come back, perhaps for happy hour or try something different on their huuge varietal menu."}
{"text":"How can I not give this restaurant five stars after trying to dine at their neighbor, Kona Grill and being ignored the whole time? We were seated promptly and our server acknowledged us right away. He got our daughter a high chair and even asked if she wanted juice. Service was excellent! The calamari, peach sangria and the lobster ravioli was excellent. It was a perfect dining experience and definitely what we needed. Thank you, Brio!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit Vegas, it is always a struggle for me to find a good restaurant to hang out with friends or family, be as loud as I can be, have a trendy atmosphere, reasonably priced, not on the strip, and the food is packed with flavor. 

I'm from Las Vegas - and there isn't a single time where I think I NEED to go to a restaurant.  Since leaving this place, I have been to restaurants that I never knew could exist - restaurants where you can hang out in a trendy restaurant, eat phenomenal food and not spend more than $30/person? What?!

I don't know what it is about Vegas. Maybe it's the fact that Vegas values the bright lights, brand names, glitz and glamour before anything else. 

Anyway, a group of us (10 + 1 baby) needed a restaurant that can hold us, have great food, reasonably priced, trendy, and away from the strip.  My friends even though they've lived here all their lives can't even give me any suggestions (I'm flabbergasted). Where I live (Phoenix), I can give you my top 10 and then some. So I decided to on Brio and I've eaten at this restaurant before in Phoenix and was not impressed. Restaurant reminds me that of a Cheesecake factory, chain restaurant.  

They did seat us right away, which was nice. The bread came out and the group was having a fun time.  We are loud as ever and the noise level of the restaurant was loud so we didn't feel like we were bothering anyone with our obnoxious rants an laughs so that was good.  I ordered the gluten free grilled salmon with lemon and caper sauce. The flavor was ok. Nothing to rave about.

I wish I had better options to fit what I was looking for in my dining experience. At the end of the night, it wasn't the flavor of the food that made the night a \"good\" night.  It was the fact that a group of 11 was able to get together, talk and laugh as loud as we want, not cringe at the bill, and still be happy and full."}
{"text":"Amazing food, excellent wait service, and accommodating staff: we had to change tables because of the boisterous atmosphere (my dad couldn't hear due to hearing aid issues), and they were amazingly sweet about it. The pasta aka vodka was creamy yet had a mild red pepper kick--the pasta itself was done perfectly. We also got the trio dessert plate--to die for."}
{"text":"I have sent the restaurant a private message as well, shall see if we hear back.  Went for dinner here with a party of 9 a few weeks ago. The place was packed, while we were seated quite promptly for our reservation, everything from that point on was far from prompt or good. Sat down at 7, finally were able to place our food order at about 7:40, by 8:30 still didn't have our food. Everyones luke warm food finally came, except for my husbands, he waited another 7-8 minutes for his, lucky him, he had the only hot dish. It was like everyone else' meal sat under the heat lamp, like a gooey mess of pasta and we even had a rare lamb chop in the mix :-( Manager came over to apologize and say that he was sorry and would take care of us. Had a few creme brulee's comped and the lamb chops. Will not be dining back here again, manager just seemed to be putting out fires and we were one of them. Our waitress tried her best and was apologetic. Very unimpressive, pricey meal for what we got."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come in the Spring and Fall when you can sit outside on the patio with great weather.  During the Winter time, we like to come here and hang out in the bar area and have a glass of Wine or three.  We normally don't eat dinner here, but enjoy meeting friends and colleagues for lunch.

The last time we were here, I had the Bistecca Insalata (Wedge of Lettuce, Gorgonzola, Bacon, Roma Tomatoes & Creamy Parmesan Dressing, $5.25).....I love Gorgonzola Cheese and find it difficult to resist a Salad with it.

Overall, it's one of our favorite places for lunch.....looking forward to Spring and the outdoor dining!

Return Factor - 91%"}
{"text":"Service was great from the moment we walked in until the moment we left! 

We were seated outside, our drink orders were taken promptly and the bread basket was brought to our table soon after. We started off with Caesar salads, then I ordered grilled lamb chops with mashed potatoes and my gf ordered angel hair pasta with grilled salmon..... everything taste great!! Cooked to perfection. Our drinks kept on getting refilled, they were never empty and dish pick up was quick.... they were \"on it\". For dessert they brought out a variety of dessert samples to our table for us to decide on . We ordered tiramisu and berry cheesecake... they were very good."}
{"text":"How to have a 5-Star experience at this 4-star chain restaurant:

Bruschetta Quattro 5 star
Spicy Shrimp Eggplant 5 star
Steak Salad 4 star"}
{"text":"Our dinner here was part of a Vegas deal that included dinner & a helicopter ride at night above the Vegas strip. So the shuttle dropped us off here before the flight informing us we had about an hour and a half before pick up. We were seated and then given a ticket receipt to show our server and then in turn order from their prix fixe menu. Our server some young guy was obviously annoyed by our dinner package and kept making it clear that gratuity was not included the deal. For drinks I ordered a bellini and for dinner we had a caesar salad & a wedge salad , along with their lasagna & a pasta dish I can't remember. The white sauce with the lasagna was a bit strange since I'm used to red sauces but it was good, everything was good. The restaurant seemed like a fancier version of olive garden but I enjoyed Brio's much more. The server was the only thing that made this visit unpleasant, his presence was scarce and I knew dinner included a dessert which he claimed to forget but seemed like he just wanted us out. Would like to return and experience a better dining experience."}
{"text":"This review was meant for another Italian restaurant. Until I can update one for Brio or delete this, I apologize for the mistake. I am human after all. I would have caught this sooner but we had a family tragedy the following day and I have been unable to be online until now. 

I sincerely apologize to the owners and management of Brio Tuscan Grille for my mistake. I don't have time to do a full review right now but we have eaten at your establishment, your food is delicious and as I said I will give a more detailed review in the near future. Please accept my apology. Thank you. 

As for the woman who sent me a very nasty message, perhaps you should think before you write to people. The words you spoke were very mean spirited and uncalled for."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to say the food is absolutely delicious!  Everything that was ordered satisfied my taste buds. Atmosphere outside is quite enjoyable.

On the service side, we thought it was strange and a bit rude that one of the waiters came through the gate outside. Which was right next to our table with a sign that read \"this is not an exit\" and moved a chair to get in and did not say, \"excuse me.\" I guess it was an entrance? Lol

Also our waitress could have been less splashy on the water refills as she dripped all over the floor and splashed some on my friend and the table. 

Other than those little things it was great. Nothing that would stop me from eating here again. Do recommend!"}
{"text":"We celebrate most birthdays at Brios. The food is good,  the waiters are friendly and the environment is nice.
I recommend it!!"}
{"text":"After a terrible dinning experience somewhere else last night Mandi at the bar cheered us all up. We walked into reverse happy hour and a bright and helpful smile from Mandi. Thank you for turning our frowns upside down. A consistently great place to eat as well."}
{"text":"Brio was the 1st leg of our progressive dinner last night (8-14-2013)  It was my dining companions birthday celebration and he had never been before.  I chose Brio for appetizers.  We were greeted promptly and seated.  I had stopped by the restaurant earlier in the day to drop off a birthday card and flowers for our table.  At that time I explained that we were only having app's there and moving on to another restaurant for our main course and a 3rd for dessert. All was well when we were seated, card and orchid in place (whew).  I ordered the Carpaccio and the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant for appetizers.  Wonderful was the food and service.  Until the server offered a dessert for the birthday boy.  Just an oversight, but all was well.  Thank you to Brio for making it a great start to our evening!!!"}
{"text":"Lobster bisque should be renamed to tomato bisque. There was no lobster flavor or pieces. Coming from New England I've had the best and this was not. Takes a long time for your food to come out. My daughter had a simple cooked salad and the lettuce was not fresh. Staff were ok. Not friendly enough but ok. Didn't fully hate it but won't return."}
{"text":"Brio has been a reliable lunch spot whenever I have guests in town. It never failed us! 
Ambiance - Check
Service - Check
Food - Check
Location - Check
They have it all~~"}
{"text":"Happy Hour with the girls.  Arrived Brio early and the place is empty.   The snowbirds are mostly gone and we have the place to ourselves.  Greeted and seated quickly.  Waited for our 4th person who arrived shortly.  We decided on 3 orders of Pepper shrimp, carpaccio, and potatoes.  The service was slower than usual but not sure why.  The food arrived all at once.  Nice presentation and good eats.  The place got more crowded as the hour got later.  We enjoyed a nice eve out.  Happy hour prices are great and you get a lot of food."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in town. I have been here for lunch, dinner, and happy hour. 

My favorite drinks are the Tuscan sangria and the strawberry basil smash. 

Both the Caesar and bistecca salads are good. Very fresh. 

Favorite pasta dishes are the lasagna, carbonara, and salmon angel hair. 

The chicken limone and lobster bisque are also very good. 

For happy hour the spicy shrimp with eggplant and the fried ravioli are my faves. 

I never have room for dessert here so no details there. 

Great place to eat outside on the patio or by the fire pits before or after shopping at Town Square."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and sat at outside patio. It was a great mother daughter  day for shopping and brunch. The brunch menu was nice I had the Tuscan bowl without the  sausage  but instead  avacodo which was delicious.  The quinoa was cooked well with the kale, mushroom  and eggs made it a velvety delight. My daughter ordered the french toast which she said was fluffy and sweet. Nice meal the server was scarce at times but the overall experience was great."}
{"text":"Great food when you're craving italian. Their house dressing is also delicious."}
{"text":"Ok. First time at Brio. Excellent first impression by our server Amit. He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and what suggested items to orders. Salmon was fantastic. Excellent presentation. My boyfriends cod was slightly dry, but we decided not to say anything.

It was two birthdays and we were surprised with two desserts. Creme brulee and caramel cheesecake. Delicious.

Overall, everything was wonderful and such a pleasant experience. Will definitely return for another dinner date"}
{"text":"This place never let's me down. Consistent good food. I usually get the steak salad, which is always perfect. I try and sneak a couple bites of my friends food, so far I've tried the lasagna, shrimp risotto, both have been excellent. The bruschetta is the best in town. And the outside seating with fire pits puts this place on my number one list to eat at when I'm at town square. This is a pretty good spot for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Tuscan restaurant I have ever been to! I had the gluten free pasta and it was very good. I normally can't eat pasta at restaurants due to my gluten and dairy allergies but the Brio staff were very accommodating and knew exactly what I could have. I didn't have to sacrifice flavor for a stomach ache, and that is a rare occurrence. Not only was the food excellent but the staff were delightful and very fast. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Me n my boyfriend decided to do a little early birthday celebration for me  so we decided to try brio  ,the experience was very beutifull and amazing, we wore very satisfied with our service, the food and wine was amazing, we are looking forward to repeat this amazing dinner again. .great job for the service n to the cook,"}
{"text":"I have always had good luck at Brio in Town Square for lunch, Happy Hour, and dinner.  Service is always good and the food and drinks are well made and full-flavored.  If you like Brio, I reccomend joining the MyBRIO REWARDS club.  You get a free meal on your birthday and various discount offers throughout the year.

This trip we came for lunch to try the new Lighter Side Menu.  About a 5 minute wait...not bad for lunch time.  Our server arrived right after we were seated for our drink order.  She was very attentive and super sweet.  I wish I remembered her name!  

I had the 5 oz Filet Brio with asparagus, cubed sweet potatoes, spinach, and roasted red peppers.  $19.95 and 365 cals.  It definitely tasted better than 365 calories...and was more filling as well!  The filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare, juicy and savory.  The portion size was just enough to share a few bites with my friend without feeling like I needed more.  For some reason I was expecting mashed sweet potatoes, but they were tiny roasted cubes and were delicious.  The asparagus, spinach, and red peppers were also prepared superbly.  All the ingredients complemented each other and the meal was delightful.  I will definitely get this again.  The price point seemed a couple dollars too high for lunch, but the meat quality was very good, so I cannot complain.

My friend had the Shrimp Mediterranean, also from the Lighter Side Menu.  $14.95/ 470 cals. It came with orzo & farro pilaf, feta, broccoli, spinach, and asparagus.  She let me sample her dish; it was very tasty and something I would order if I was not super hungry.  I think mine was more filling because of my protein choice.

All in all, another good Brio meal!"}
{"text":"I can't begin to say how much I enjoyed this restaurant. If I had the money I would open one. The ambience was amazing and the food was delicious. We had the bruschetta sampler and I couldn't pick my favorite. The lobster bisque is out of this world. Service was a little slow but he was very nice and helpful. The best was the mini Creme brûlée. Yum. Found there's one in Irvine, I'm going again very soon."}
{"text":"Brio is a nice Italian restaurant in the heart of Town Square. The prices are affordable and comparable to any other chain restaurant found at a mall such as Cheesecake Factory. I like that they offer a number of gluten-free options including their pasta. The restaurant itself is huge with a nice high ceiling. Service was prompt and our waitress checked in on us frequently.

Lunch started off with a couple of appetizers including the beef carpaccio and calamari fritto misto. Although the carpaccio color appeared on the paler side, the actual beef mixed with greens, capers, and mustard aioli tasted delicious. I was disappointed that the calamari was on the soggier side. We were served the standard bread and Parmesan crisps, but I was annoyed by the ice cold and rock hard butter, which has always been a major pet peeve of mine. 

Lunch specials included a two course meal featuring a soup or salad plus a pasta dish. I got the lobster bisque, which was good, but on the salty side. I had a feeling that it was mostly filled with the shrimp to cover up for the lack of lobster meat. Nonetheless, it was a nice excuse to eat more bread. For my pasta dish, I got the campanelle carbonara. The plate was less than a full entree, but by that time I was getting pretty full. For drinks, they don't carry any beer on draft.

Although, I wasn't super impressed with the food, given the service, space, and prices, Brio is pretty fancy for a mall restaurant and a nice fit for Town Square."}
{"text":"Great Italian style eating!
Dinner with family valet parking lots included!
Anthony waited on us and was very pleasant and efficient ! 
If you are in Summerlin  county this place is a must!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy eating here. One of my favorite's in Town Sq. Especially if I am in the mood for Italian. I believe this has overall a much higher quality of food than some of the other Italian chains out there. Decor and ambiance is also very inviting and pleasant. Its easy to wait for  a table as you are in the middle of town square or even head to the Brio bar and hang out. Overall a great experience every time I have gone."}
{"text":"Great location, reasonable prices and impressive decor BUT mediocre food. We celebrated our anniversary there and are fortunately still married. A typical chain...won't be on our revisit list.

Update (9/20): met a friend there for Happy Hour because it was convenient...how bad could their appetizers be...they were! In fact, when the waiter acknowledge that receiving only 2 out of the 3 appetizers that we ordered was \"not bad\", we knew that our expectations (fair at best)  were met. 

NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I came here for a wedding reception and I was very upset with the service. 

First of all if your planning on having a wedding or any reception here, I don't recommend Brio Tuscan Grille for it. The room isn't very private, they don't have doors to close it off, they just have curtains. You can hear everyone in their main dinning room. The worst part was my table was by the kitchen. While the wedding party was saying their speeches, all I can hear was plates being bang left and right, the staff having LOUD conversations and overall a ton of feedback. 

The food that was severed was family style. We had a chicken dish (very dry), fish was pretty good (that's what my one star rating is for), pasta (was alright) bread and salad (not enough dressing). The food presentation was so messy and dirtying looking. 

Very upsetting on how they rushed us the whole dinner. They should have slowed down on clearing our plates and focused more on customers service and filling up our water. 

Lots of other restaurants in the areas to choose from."}
{"text":"This location is very pretty, is great for people watching (if you sit outside) and has some good food! The patio area is gorgeous and they do have some delicious appetizers and drinks. It's a great spot for meeting friends. 

Their brunch is also delicious. I was surprised that we were able to get brunch reservations for Easter Sunday the day before! 

Both times that I've visited the service was great - the second time our waiter was especially good with the toddler in our party."}
{"text":"Excellent time for 3 couples to dine and catch up.
We had may great entrees and some outstanding wine.

Or only challenge was that they had a great fish special and 2 of our party was told at 5:55pm that it was sold out.  so for a weekday the specials are suspect.

The service was kind and attentive.  The value was good and great taste in the food.
Worth  the drive from Tempe

{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place!  My wife and I were recently in Las Vegas and stopped by here with a friend.  The server was excellent...and even brought some pizza dough to occupy my daughters attention!  I had a bruschetta sampler that was amazing.  Their wine selection was excellent.  We were even visited at our table by the executive chef.  After all was said and done, he paid for our meal and drinks!  Food, service, and decor all top notch in my book.  I do not give 5 star ratings easily!"}
{"text":"Brio is a very pretty restaurant, and the food is not bad (although far from outstanding)....but it's so damn crowded, and the wait for a table is so long that I won't go there anymore.

On Wednesday, it was so jammed that when I asked the hostess how long the wait for a table would be, she said \"oh, just 30 or 40 minutes\".
I told her to never, ever, put the word \"just\" in front of a \"30 or 40 minute wait\".

There are many other Italian restaurants in Las Vegas where you will get better service, and better food."}
{"text":"Happy hour food and drinks are amazing! Great prices! Shrimp tasty and dirty martinis all night long"}
{"text":"Very average experience. One of the places that mostly charges you for feeling all grown-up in white cloth napkin paradise which is fine except most people come to restaurants for the food and it was very mediocre. 
My red sauce pasta with overcooked chicken didn't feel like anything worth more than $5, and nevertheless it was $15; bruschetta was missing the zest and freshness. I guess wine and bread were good. Service was very attentive ( almost as if they also tried my pasta and knew it was a rip off). In general this place is as far from perfect as Cleveland from Italy."}
{"text":"I could eat here three times a week. Since I don't live close by I always seem to order the same thing. The beef carpaccio and spicy shrimp and eggplant are so good it is hard to go off the beaten path. The desserts are all delicious especially the tiramisu and cheesecake with berries. The wine list also has a lot of great options. There is not a better option the next time your at Town Square."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went last night and our server was very hospitable. I'm a server as well and it made me appreciate her patience with our dietary restrictions even more. Just a suggestion to mgmt is to keep staff up on table maintenance and cleanliness. When we sat our table had not been wiped, there was still coins on the table from a prior guest and the floor below us was filthy. It is a great & beautiful establishment. Keep up the good work. :)"}
{"text":"I have been to this Brio location a couple times and each time has always been a great time! Whether with big groups or with just one other person, I've always gotten great service!

For this experience in particular, I decided to sit at the outside bar sonce the bar on the inside was already packed (also because the inside bar was a little too dimly lit for me). Upon sitting down, the bartender immediately greeted me and my friend and provided us with happy hour menus and asked if we had any questions regarding the menu. Her attitude was so nice, friendly and happy it instantly made me happy! I wish I had gotten her name. 

I ordered the sangria rosa which was honestly so yummy. It was just right and not too strong. Definitely wins my heart over the white or red sangria. 

For food I ordered the blackened shrimp with the eggplant. It was literally sooooo good and sooo filled with flavor and spice that I had to order it a second time. Definitely love coming to this Brio location especially for their HH!"}
{"text":"Outstanding service by Chase. Truly exception for our group of six adults and 2 tired kids. 

The atmosphere is comfortable and food was tasty, as always at Brio. We had the Gorgonzola beef medallions, 5oz filet, pasta far diabolical with chicken and chicken Milanese. Several substitutions (fries for mashed, etc) and no problems at all. 

Service was quick and friendly. Food was hot. Overall a great experience for a family on vacation. It was my sister in law's birthday and it was the perfect place for a nice evening. The free app with Yelp check in is also a nice perk. 

With the free app, Chase made several recommendations and adjusted it to our needs. We ended up with the bruschetta sampler with 4 steak and 4 roasted red pepper. Omitting the ones with bacon. 

I highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go for a group of people at work. When I arrived, the hostess was rude and kept trying to look around me at people coming in. She handed me my bill, and when I handed it back with the credit card - she replied that it would be a few minutes in a snobby tone. 

The food was fine... probably the only thing that made me round up to 3 stars. 

Strawberry Balsamic Chicken Salad - good, lots of chicken, could use a little more Gorgonzola cheese. 

I also noticed that the Fettuccine Rusticca looked good. 

To go order was well prepared with utensils and napkins. Also included a bag of bread and crackers - both were pretty good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to hang out at and do work. Very calm atmosphere, staff is friendly , food is good. The white peach sangria is my favorite on a hot day. It's typically my go to spot to meet my girlfriends, or can be a swanky place to meet for a business meeting. I've went to multiple locations and love where the owners have chosen to build the restaurants. Will definitely continue to go to brio."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since moving to AZ and have had bad experiences both times. The first time I ordered a lunch special and paid extra for a salad. When I got home I noticed that I only had a half portion of pasta and no salad. I called and spoke to a manager who was very nice and apologetic. She told me that the next time that I was in that I would get lunch on the house. My husband and I decided to visit after shopping and it was his first time coming. We ordered the calamari and asked if our son's pizza and fruit could come out first. The calamari came out and the pizza didn't come out for another 10 minutes, then we had to ask our waitress for his fruit, 10 minutes later we got his fruit. An hour went by and we never received our pasta, yet the table behind us received their food and they arrived after us. The waitress acknowledged that it was taking a while and kept saying \"it will be out shortly\" after waiting over an hour for ravioli and having our son become tired and upset,  we decided to just pay for the calamari and pizza and leave. My husband happened to run into the manager to see if he could pay our check, in which I told her that we never received our food at all. She was very nice and comped the check, our waitress never even told her that we had been waiting that long. We certainly won't be back. Not a good experience on separate occasions but the manager was very sweet."}
{"text":"As you can see I do not review very often (or at all). I felt this place should be reviewed though. I work long  hours and many days of the week and I happened to have some time off to spend with my wife and my 2yr old son. I thought it would be nice to go \"try out the Italian place in Town Square.\" They have outdoor seating and I love Italian food. I have ate at many of the other restaurants there in Town Square but not Brio.

When we get there we asked to be seated outside since that was one of the reasons for choosing the place. We sit and wait a few minutes but not too long for the waiter to come by and take our drink orders. He leaves and is gone for a while but then comes back with waters which we didn't order but that is ok. Still waiting on my beer though. He eventually makes his way back to our table with my beer and takes our orders. 

After he leaves I take a nice big drink from my beer to realize the glass is dirty!! Now I'm a aircraft mechanic, I don't mind being dirty and have a certain tolerance for dirty, but when you charge 8 bucks for a beer I would like it in a clean glass or at least one that isn't sticky!!

Now I wait a while for the waiter to come back to let him know the glass is dirty so he can replace it. Once again he finally shows up so i could inform him of the issue. He apologizes and says he will be right back. He does come right back with a new glass and proceeds to pour the beer from the dirty glass to the \"clean\" one. No bullshit. Isn't that like scooping water from the toilet bowl and calling it clean? Needless to say I drank the water. 

I ordered one of the 14oz steaks since I was happy to spend time with the family. I ordered it medium because thats the way I like it. However, I got it well done, so well done the edges were burnt to s crisp! You got to be kidding me. A 30 dollar steak that you cooked all the flavor out of! I eat it because I am not the kind of person that will fuss about an overcooked steak only to get a properly cooked steak with spit in it. Especially after the dirty beer incident. 

I don't normally turn back food or complain since I am easily pleased but I think for a 100 dollar meal you should be pretty damn happy with all aspects of the service. 

I will never go here again! There are plenty of places to eat at Town Square and new ones are opening all the time. I'm hoping soon there will be a new opening in the Brio location. 

Do yourself a favor......eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular. Great atmosphere and fantastic food. Our server was phenomenal and gave us great laughs while enjoying our meals. They even gave me an iced latte, which isn't something they typically make, and it was made perfectly. This place is great and I will certainly be making a trip back here again."}
{"text":"We came here for Valentine's Day and they were slammed. We had to wait 20 minutes after our reservation time to get seated. I understand the wait because apparently they had 1200 reservations today! We sat outside and our service was outstanding. Our server Joey R was awesome! He made sure our food came as quickly as possible and was just right. He was very funny and kept making jokes which is a huge plus in my book. He made handling so many customers seem easy and still spent time talking to each table. I love this place and had a great experience tonight!"}
{"text":"My family and I were celebrating my mother in laws birthday, when a pigeon that had gotten into the restaurant pooped on my sister in law!  It did it twice; the first time we thought someone had flipped sauce on her, and three of us helped her get it out of her hair.  The second time, we looked around and noticed the bird above her head.  The staff was disgustingly unprofessional, insulted us with a 20 dollar gift card after we spent 500 dollars on food (that's not even enough to go back and have the meal paid for!!), the waiters and waitresses laughed, told other guests, swore, and mocked our family.  Your staff implying that a filthy disease ridden animal defecating on guests near the kitchen of your restaurant is out of the company's policy to make things right makes me shudder to think what else you would not help on.  I've had better customer service in every single other restaurant I've ever attended.  To make matters worse, when posting complaints on your Facebook wall, after talking to my sister in law who ever manages that account LIED and said she was fine with how things were handled!  Your customer service is disgusting and as we now see on more than just your one restaurants standard.  We are a family of 20 adults with in laws, 30 grandchildren and have been established in Las Vegas.  Your lack of class and neglegance has lost all of our business and all of extended family and friends business."}
{"text":"Worst ever! Filing complaint waitress was horrific the worse experience ever another couple was just as ready to leave as us. Very sad people can be so rude"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a nice, classy, ladies night.  Drinks, and good food are always fun. Love drinking their sangria on the patio even though service does tend to be a little slower. Have had several dishes and their menu and all were good! Love the bread and oil! I really did enjoy their calamari and stuffed mushrooms! Lots of flavor and different selections! Fantastic deserts to chose from!
 I will say that it's not the best Italian food but, the ambience and service does make of for the food not being the greatest."}
{"text":"Ordered several items and drinks to try.  Some items tasted a bit salty to me. But overall had a nice experience.  The waitress was extra friendly. The high ceiling tuscan dining room was much more impressive than anticipated. Next time I would love to try the crab cakes."}
{"text":"I wasnt impressed but the wife enjoyed it. Meal took a long time to come out. Waiter didn't ask us for refills until food came out. He forgot my soup. I had chicken, she had salmon."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat . The food is amazing and the service is top notch .you'll the the happy hour as well."}
{"text":"I was coming here since this place (finally) opened on my side of town.  The happy hour is just amazing.  It was $2.99 for like 8 different dishes, but I recently went back and was disappointed to find that happy hour dishes are now $3.99.  The bartender told me they have some newer items, and the portions are bigger.  I wouldn't know as I went for the burger, which did not change in size.  They also told me they added $5 cocktails, which also didn't matter to me as I was drinking a regular priced Stella, if I remember correctly.

I came back a few weeks later and had two apps, the beef carpaccio and the crispy shrimp.  I almost always get the carpaccio, so I was pretty excited when indeed a bigger plate arrived.  Except once I was digging in, I found that they had sliced the meat thinner than before, and so it seemed like the same amount... or LESS!  The meat kind of stuck to the plate, so it wasn't the same enjoyable appetizer that I was used to.

The crispy shrimp were a nice addition to the menu, though.  Tasty, plentiful, and not too much breading.  I definitely enjoyed that.  I also tried a $5 sangria rosa just so I could sample their drink menu, and it was good, but it didn't blow me away.

This is still one of the best happy hours on this side of town, but it's not the \"oh my god we have to go there\" deal that it once was."}
{"text":"All I know is that I sampled pizza throughout the Rise Up Japan bake sale, and it was pretty delicious pizza.  All the workers were pretty friendly.  One day I'll have to actually try this place out, though I'll probably wait until their Boca Park location opens."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, I had the pasta alla vodka which was delicious and my boyfriend had the pasta Brio which he finished. The issue with this place is the service and price. We came here for my boyfriends 20th birthday and I specifically let the server know. When we had finished our meal, the server offered us a dessert menu since we were celebrating. What kind of restaurant doesn't give out a birthday dessert to a customer specifically deciding to spend their birthday at their restaurant? Even if it's just a cookie or small scoop of ice cream. For the price of the food, they should at least have the decency to give out a birthday dessert. Will definitely not be going back here for any special occasions because they obviously don't care about investing in the lives of their customers or what they're celebrating."}
{"text":"I've been to Brio 2x in the last month.  My first time was because I had a gift card.  The second time was on my but obviously enjoyed it enough the first time to return!

This place is busy right up until 10PM on weekends so call ahead and make a reservation.

Very neat ambiance.  Reminds me of the Venetian in Vegas.  Upscale and wide open so the noise level is slightly above average.

The food....  Yummy as can be!  I'm one who counts carbs so why am I going to an Italian restaurant?  The salmon is to die for.  The steaks are to die for.  Even the salads are yummy.

Service is average to a bit above.  Bottom line is that this is not the place to go to if in a hurry.  Great for a group."}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars I could. We visit often as we work at Tivoli. We came for dinner on a Sunday night. Chicken Parm was good. Could have been great with more melted mozzarella. The short rib was a total no go. This is the second  time the majority of the short rib was fat and lite to no meat. Posting the before and after pic as I had to share my chicken parm because there was no meat on the short rib."}
{"text":"The food was awesome as always. However, this is the second time I've sat in the bar and had the bartender as my server. He is awful!! I asked for my check and it took him 10 minutes to bring it to me and then it took him another 5 minutes to pick it up. I was on my lunch break so I was in a bit of a hurry and he just didn't care. He did this the last time I was there too. Just awful service..."}
{"text":"What a great experience we had at lunch today at Brio Tuscan Grill at Scottsdale Quarter. Our server Scott was very professional and service was great. It was extra special when the Executive Chef Joe Milbert came to see if we were satisfied with our meal and if we needed anything. Bravo for Brio. Recommending to my friends to frequent this establishment."}
{"text":"4 of us had to go to Gilbert and have always loved Brio. Being from Ohio it's like being home. The GM Joe Milbert greeted us and made sure we were comfortable. Very welcoming and very professional. Our server John was top notch. Service was impeccable and fast ---John was very knowledgeable and quick. Next time we are in Gilbert we will definitely come back to Brio Tuscan Grille"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service, hits the spot every time. A+

Definitely recommend. Try the New York steak"}
{"text":"Great hh here. $3 appetizer menu!  The quality was pretty good too. Drinks r only .50$ off tho"}
{"text":"Olive Garden?

Italian restaurants are a dime a dozen and this is yet another chain eatery to add to the list.  BUT, it is a notch up from Olive Garden.  Food was good, drinks were passable and I left wishing I had spent my money at Montesano's instead."}
{"text":"I've had my eye on this place before it even opened and finally got the chance to check it out! 

Inside is just BEAUTIFUL (see pics) An upscale but casual feel.
They also have a spacious patio area.

All the staff that I came in contact with were very friendly and informative. 

I ordered an Ice Tea........it was good. 
They served me hot crusty bread with these Fabulous Rosemary Cheese Crisps.......I asked for more they were so good!! ;-) (see pics) 

The waitress told me I could modify any item on the menu if I needed to or special order anything I didn't see.... 

..that is a HUGE plus when a place is willing to go above and beyond to accommodate you and also means they obviously are preparing these items fresh if they can change any item. I definitely appreciate that. 

I decided on ordering the Roasted Chicken and Butternut squash risotto, Lunch portion comes with salad. (see pics) 

OMG.....SO Delicious and piping HOT, it had such amazing flavor depth, topped with crisp prosciutto and fresh basil chiffonade. 

I was in heaven, I'm gonna dream about that dish for sure! 

Now for dessert, they offer about ten different things in a mini teacup size...........WOW! That is so cool, you can try more than one thing without being a total pig or spending a fortune! LOVE IT!! 

I decided on one of the many creme brulee' flavors, I got the brown sugar (see pics) Perfect size Perfect Flavor, truly!

I noticed on their website that they serve a Brunch menu on the weekends until 3pm. I'd like to try that as well.

I honestly can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Everyone's talking about this place and I finally had a chance to go with my girlfriend's. We went during their happy hour and the food was great. Each of us ordered the Brio burger and let me tell you, I was impressed that it had great flavor, yet it wasn't heavy like some burgers at restaurants like this. My only compliant was that I ordered it medium, but it was slightly over medium.  However, it was still moist and juicy.   The beef carpaccio was delicious and so was the fried cheese ravioli.  For drinks I had the peach white sangria.  It tasted great and was very refreshing. The prices are the best I've seen yet for happy hour.  I spent about $13 for the burger, carpaccio, and drink.  Not too bad, especially when you're on a budget.  The service was also good. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I was actually so full with my portion and I couldn't finish the whole thing. There are so many flavours and it touches every single centimetre of your Tuscan palate. Calamari is fantastic and we got out reservation within the half hour we called it in. Perfect service, and she was fantastic and talked to us a lot. The only problem was that no birthday wishes were sent to my mother--who had her 50th that night. I called it in through the phone and they said they would wish her a happy birthday, but nothing happened. 
Maybe I'll pull the waiter aside next time!!"}
{"text":"First time in, food is very good, staff is very friendly, I would give it a 5-star but, they need a little more assistance with the food servers. Even though our server was very nice and very helpful, you can tell that she was rushed, Not stressed, just rushed. She needed some assistance which I didn't see anybody else helping her. Besides that, I would highly recommended for a very good experience in dining."}
{"text":"I've visited this place a few times.. Went last night, and noticed their menu was different and that all their pastas and entrees do not come with complimentary soup/salad anymore! You have to pay $5 extra if you want a soup or salad!!! And all the prices went up!! My pasta dish was $19!!! It used to be about $16. My boyfriend got somewhat of a chicken Parmesan and that was $20!! And nothing special might I add! I will not b going to this place unless it's for an event or something it's definitely NOT WORTH IT!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were driving looking for a bite to eat and went in last min tonight for Pasta, Happy Hour Food and Drinks.  We sat in bar area..Megan was our server and a guy named Dillion (her busses) and  another guy who was the food runner who's name I can't remember (although I wish I could) but my service was amazing.   My friend and I BOTH work in the industry and were so blown away at the TEAM work!  We ordered two orders of beef carpaccio, spinach dip and a pasta vodka dish along with several drinks....one drink I even asked Megan our sever to surprise us and it was a delicious concoction I would have never thought to create."}
{"text":"I've been to Brio twice. Brio's pasta with vodka sauce is at the summit of the pantheon of great pasta dishes. Their appetizers are all superb. Don't miss enjoying great food in a wonderful setting. Five stars all the way."}
{"text":"The best happy hour! Yes, they have good items in their non-happy hour menu but MAN for the quality + price in their HH menu u need to go!

HH is @ 3:30-6:30pm but I can't remember if it's mon-fri or mon-thursday, always call and ask!

HH FOOD 5/5:
-Beef Carpaccio ($5): WOW this was amazing. It's like raw meat but it's flavored really good. The plate they serve it in is also huge.
-Black Pepper Shrimp ($6): This plate doesn't taste like there's eggplant in it. IT IS SO DELICIOUS. Super soft and the shrimp doesn't taste fishy.
-I heard all the other items in HH are good, but I haven't ventured out to try them."}
{"text":"Talking about a disaster. I am writing this review immediately after one of the worst services i've experienced ever. I have never been so ticked off by a server in my entire life. The service provided by this server named Monica (as indicated on the receipt) in the outside area was just pathetic. 

Our friend arrived at the table early and got a table on the outside. But when we arrived, because we had our dog, we requested a different table where my dog could be better isolated from the rest of the crowd and the two other little puppies near by. The reason for this was that even though my dog is friendly but she loves food too much and she begs other people for food. When we asked for a different table, what we got was a sarcastic response from the host that \"well your server won't be (name).\" nevertheless, she reluctantly left all the menus and left. I was pretty annoyed by that response but decided not to let something like that messes up our perfect morning. 

Well that was just the beginning. Our server Monica was just awful. I don't think she knows how to smile. My mother asked if there was any breakfast entree, she snatched the menu from my mom's hands, turned it around and tapped on the menu to show her the two breakfast entree. I almost stood up in my seat to confront her but my mom kept me on my seat. I then said I am not ready to order yet because we just sat down, Monica just turned around and left. There was no \"I will give you guys a minute to decide.\" 

The service remained laughably bad throughout. She only gave us two water even though we had a party of 3. I needed a coffee refill; I gotta ask someone else for it. I needed water refill; Glgotta ask someone else for it. I needed a change of your drink because a bug fell in it? I asked politely and she gave me a dirty look, turned around without saying a word. She then came back 5 minutes later with the drink and left it on my table without saying a word and then turned around and left. It was like if I was causing her the biggest trouble in the world. Never once did she come by check how we were doing like the other Brio servers would do normally. Never once did she come by to refill any of the drink we ordered. 

The only thing that stopped from me going to a manager just now is because we didn't want to mess up our perfect morning with a friend we haven't seen in awhile. But the more I think about her pathetic service, the angrier I get. Her service was unacceptable. 

My family is regular here and they said this was an isolated incident. But still this was the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I am in disbelief that this type of service is allowed at a Brio resturant. I am reasonable so I will give one star for the good food and the other servers who were great at helping us becuase Monica couldn't. In all honesty, the experience deserved not a single star."}
{"text":"Happy Hour: Monday through Friday 3-7 pm and then again from 9 pm to close.

The Details (taken from Internet): While we were surprised that they offer no drink specials, we were delighted by Brio's menu called Tuscan Tasters, which features a variety of hearty appetizers for $2.95 each. The standouts on this menu include the Steak Bruschetta ($2.95), with a balsamic sweetness to it, and the Sausage and Pepperoni Flatbread ($2.95), with its thin crispy crust, was easy to eat and very flavorful. The servers, weaving their way through the crowd of people waiting for tables, were helpful and ever present. They seemed to work as a team, and help each other run food, fill water, and give other general support. Each of them claimed the Brio Burger with homemade chips ($2.95) to be their favorite."}
{"text":"BEST BRUNCH IN WESTLAKE.
While the food is generally pretty good at any time, the brunch is definitely my favorite. A little on the pricey side for the portion size but quality ingredients.  Their fresh fruit sangria is amazing paired with the Tuscan Omelet! Very healthy also!"}
{"text":"This place was so great! Food was delicious, very good quality. Our server was super professional and took great care of us. Alcoholic drinks are good and reasonably priced! Would recommend and I would return."}
{"text":"I used to work at a nearby store in Town Square and have been in this store for a few times now but only managed to write a review now due to the amazing service of our waiter Amit or Ameet (not sure exactly how you spell it). He was very accommodating, patient, and great with his recommendations (the eggplant/shrimp was sooooo good)! 

The location is great too, feels very fancy but welcoming. You can either dine inside or outside depending on the weather. 

The only thing I wish they would change is the complimentary bread coz it lacked a little bit of flavor and it wasn't warm, plus the butter they served was cold so it was a bit disappointing trying to spread some on the bread. I prefer a side of good olive oil and balsamic vinegar as opposed to cold butter."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat and good food.  However I don't appreciate being rushed through dinner. The past two times we've gone three the server(s) have wanted to take our drink, appetizer, & dinner order all at once.  Last Sunday the waitress tried to take our dinner order after our drinks arrived I had to tell the waitress that we would order our meals after the appetizers arrived.  Our meals were good but the minute we put our forks down she was immediately there asking if we needed boxes & wanted dessert."}
{"text":"We had lunch yesterday and we were disappointed. For the prices we really expected better. My friend and I shared the Brio chopped salad. It was a mediocre salad with a smidgen of feta cheese. There were a few sliced black olives clearly from a can. Overall a very disappointing salad. I had the Shrimp Mediterranean which was very tasty. It wasn't pretty but I enjoyed it. My friend had the Lobster Ravioli.  There was a sign outside with a picture that looked delicious. The plate served looked nothing like it. The ravioli clearly was from frozen and proved to be so in our opinion by the lack of flavor. A big disappointment. Honestly we would have been willing to pay a bit more for something much better but what we were served made the price far too much. 
The service was okay. Yes just okay. We had Iced tea and had to ask for lemon. I guess asking before bringing our drinks wouldn't have been efficient. We were asked if we wanted another serving of iced tea after our meal, yay! Of course we had to wait and then ask for more lemon. The tea was fresh and so was the lemon so there's that. We did leave a generous tip because our waitress was young and maybe just learning. 
I gave 3 stars but honestly with those prices I won't be back even though the ambiance of the restaurant is very nice."}
{"text":"I still love this place. Their happy hour (330-630) is so bomb. Great martinis, sangrias, blackened shrimp, flatbread pizzas, and nachos."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here for our anniversary dinner. It was very easy to make reservations online.

The restaurant is very dim, interior was beautiful and classy. We went on a Sunday night and they seemed to be pretty busy but their service was very fast. We got our drinks and appetizer right away. Our food came not too long after that. Which was great! Usually places being that busy take quite awhile. 

We ordered calamari as an appetizer and blue moon and moscato for our drinks. My bf wasn't please with the blue moon coming from the bottle. But I was very pleased with the moscato and the calamari was good. For our entrees, I ordered lobster and shrimp fettuccine and my bf had the 8oz filet mignon. Although, my bf was disappointed that the steak was almost smaller than my fist.. both entrees were delicious!

Would come here again whenever I crave Italian!"}
{"text":"We discovered this one after shopping the west elm, and stopped in for a snack, had the meatballs, which were tasty, and served with polenta, which we liked, Decided to come back and try the happy hour, had their burger, really good, shrimp cocktail, not that interesting, more meatballs, still liked them, and the service was efficient if not overly warm, The place looks like an Italian version of the Cheesecake factory, all big and fancy and chainlike, but the food is definately pretty good, so we ll go back and try dinner soon,"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch, and we ordered the soup and salad, the Bistecca
 salad, and minestrone soup, really good price, and the salad was chilled, it was delicious, the soup was pretty good too, I think I like Olive Garden's Minestrone better, my girlfriend says their Happy Hour is really great also !"}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my experience at Brio. This was my first time in the town square area. My friend suggested coming here before dropping us off to catch our flight back home. I assumed they are a bigger city franchise, but it was still fun to try a place we don't have in lincoln. Service was exquisite and our waiter was very nice in answering our questions and frequently refilling our waters. We all opted for the lunch combos-reasonably priced and ended up being the perfect amount of food. I got the pasta brio with the red pepper sauce, chicken, and mushrooms over rigatoni. It had really good flavor in the sauce and was evenly portioned with the chicken and mushrooms. I also got Caesar salad for my side and loved it. It was the type of creamy but yet still oily homemade Caesar I expect at Italian restaurants like this. My husband got the fettuccini Alfredo and liked his dish as well. My friend said the tomato basil soup was one of the best she'd ever tried. They made sure we had enough bread and got a second basket as well. I really enjoyed the seasoned flatbread, in addition to the traditional bread that was served. This was a great meal to have before getting on the plane-filling but not overly stuffed or something that is going to make you feel sick after. I'd try brio again! Nice, clean ambiance similar to that of an Olive Garden but still with a casual feel so you don't feel obligated to dress up."}
{"text":"Great food. Our waitress was awesome. All in all this was a very good dining experience."}
{"text":"Came in and my friends had already been seated, and actually ordered already.  As soon as I sat down, our server handed me a menu and took my drink order (strawberry lemonade FTW!);  She quickly returned with my beverage, and I was ready to order... Steak salad.  Weird, I thought, but it turned out to be soooooo good!  Our service continued to be on point, and we left quite satisfied.  The mini size desserts are perfect to complete any meal.  I had a cute sized creme brulee that didn't leave me overwhelmed.  I will be back here next time I'm in Vegas. The location in Town Square is great.  There's meter parking right outside.  Covered free parking also available for those who don't mind a short walk."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend to this place! We got a seat out by patio and waited about 15 minuets and No one showed up!! Got up and exited this place!! They try to be upscale but its a joke!
Would never return!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with the family the day after Thanksgiving.  It's located in  Tivoli Sqare,  The food was above average, restaurant is very nicely decorated, and the service was ok.  The price, $$$ not worth that.  I'd come back if there is no other place to go."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious reasonably prices. Went for brunch. The chips with the chipotle chicken sandwich not the best rather have had fresh fruit instead."}
{"text":"Great Food, Great Service! Not one bad thing to say. Two thumbs up all the way around"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant with outstanding service.  Had a ladies night there and they accommodated all our needs. Loved the buffalo chicken nachos they were delicious!! If you are looking for a great place to meet up and enjoy great food with a fun atmosphere Brio is your place."}
{"text":"Ted was an excellent server! We were there Wednesday night. Had the salmon with crab cake topper, diced sweet potatoes & asparagus. It was phenomenal. Please add to your menu! Would come every week for that dish. Birthday dessert trio was very good."}
{"text":"My family loves this place. We go here for a lot of celebrations and holidays. Only complaint is the wait is a little long even if you've made a reservation."}
{"text":"Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (33 of 365). I have a lot of catching up to do!

This 5 star review is for their Sunday Brunch. Although, I can say that their week night dinners there are just as yummy.  But their Brunch I have to say, is super yummy!  For dinner, I like their lobster ravioli; exceptional!

As for my lovely brunch, they mix their early morning mimosas and bloody mary's real well.  They have like 3 different kinds of eggs benedicts.  My friends and I decided to order all of them to to try.  We had your normal canadian bacon, another one with shrimp and crab, and a very different one: chorizo and chicken.  All of them were so good.  You must try them all!

To top off our buffet of eggs benedicts, we shared the Rasberry creme stuffed French Toast.  Nice 3 big slices that we each had or own good individual piece.  All of this was to die for.  We will definitely be back for Sunday brunch!  

Fair warning: there is quite a wait for the brunch."}
{"text":"Quickly seated and served but the overall quality of the food was very poor. Killed the mood for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"We were there for a birthday party. Service was great, as was the food. We really enjoyed ourselves and the ambiance contributed to the good time."}
{"text":"Food has never failed on my visits to Brio. Since we had such a rainy day yesterday I craved non other than than their famous Lobster Bisque-a harvest colored creamy goodness in a cup. I always order this and so should you.

Sauvignon Blanc was crisp and cold, warm sourdough bread basket was a perfect compliment. We shared some Caprese-sliced buffalo chunky tomatoes, olive oil, drops of balsamic vinegar and arugula was fresh and a perfect start.  

The hubby can't resist a wedge salad and I can't resist trying it. The creamy blue-cheese dressing was mild and the big slice of ice-burg was covered in bacon bits, tomatoes and onion. MMM.

Service was friendly and atmosphere always lovely.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Brio Tuscan Grille has become our new hotspot.  We love it.

Food is always fresh and delicious

Service never fails and the restaurant is gorgeous!

Sourdough and crispy thin bread basket is fabulous, but don't fill up save it for your entree!

Risotto with chicken and sweet potato. Yum!

Caprese just like I had in Sicily...fresh tomato and greens with buffalo mozzarella, olive oil, and balsamic with the perfect amount of S&P.  

Amazing service-everyone was smiling and very friendly, nice hostess, great waitress, love the kids menu which offers healthy alternative like salmon, broccoli and mashed potato's one of the reasons we come here...it's my child's favorite!

Four Seasons Service!

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I figured this was another one of those places that spent more money on decor than quality of food boy was I surprised.  We started with the bruschetta sampler I snagged a steak one with tomatoes parm and a nice hint of balsamic that was great the best thing I had that night.  Also got one of tomato and goat cheese ones which were pretty tasty too.  Next a salad with their creamy parm dressing which was balanced very well also.  Just enough cheese, onions, maters it was great.  Some others had the lobster bisque and said it was fishy even to seasoned fish eaters.  On to the pasta they had a fruit of the sea special which was great hint of spicy red pepper flakes a light sauce that didn't drown out the seafood.  I did have one problem with the dish I got 4 mussels maybe 3 oz of fish. Cut to the size of baby scallops and the scallops that were supposed to be in there were AWOL which is probably why the fish was cut that way.  Now the 4 shrimp I got in there were tender tasty and perfectly cooked just like the rest of the seafood were great but for me I would like to see alot more fruit of the sea. Service was friendly but not best I've had.  Overall a good place great tasting food and one of the few places that I've seen give more than a few raviolis in those dishes wanna go back and try the lobster raviolis and if that plate is smaller than mushroom ravioli plate I'm gonna be pissed.

Also the kids plates are really good and the portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"Came here to meet up with a couple of yelpers.  We sat at the bar area to try their happy hour bar food.  I had a strawberry lemonade and as far as happy hour food goes I had the spicy shrimp and eggplant, beef carpaccio, and shrimptini.  

The spicy shrimp and eggplant wasn't that spicy, it was perfect.  The sauce was great, if I was at olive garden I would grab a garlic bread and wipe the plant clean.  The beef carpaccio was delightful.  I wanted to chew on the beef like a piece of bubble gum until the flavor ran out.  The salad had just the right amount of dressing.  The shrimptini is your regular shrimp in a martini glass.

The happy hour goes: 
Monday - Friday from 3:30pm-6:30pm & Monday-Thursday 9pm-Close.

Stop by, if you can find a seat, and enjoy a quick snack while you shop around!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is always good. They stay open until 11pm. I finished my meal off with two deserts: cheesecake and cream brûlée! Delicious I must say!!!"}
{"text":"The wifey wanted to come back to Brio after her and her girlfriend came the week before for Happy Hour.  Honestly, it was just OK.

I agreed to go because since its opening I still hadn't been to Tivoli Village.  I'm for 'yuppie-ism' in many cases, and seeing how rich people sometimes like to spend their money just amazes me (and somewhat annoys me at the same time).  But to each their own.  Who am I to tell the local Summerlin millionaire that the restaurant chains they visit are often vastly inferior to the local Mom & Pop Italian deli down the way?  They'll probably just scoff then go back to their yuppie gym (I'm looking at you David Barton) where apparently only people with 8+ abs, and Armani workout clothes can sweat it out.  Yes, I am in fact wearing last, last, last season Adidas sneakers (but in my defense they are a rare blue pair) and a pleather jacket.  

Tivoli Village was nice, but I was right in that it caters to specific clientele.  I like window shopping (unlike my homeboy 50 Cent) and wow, 'what-I-cannot-afford-even-if-I-tried' syndrome took over.  But I digress on back to eating (and fantasizing I was P-Diddy's hidden 16 year old bastard son).

Seems like Brio is one of the only restaurants that has survived the turmoil of Tivoli Village.  A number of eateries here have come and gone over the year.

Now I can only comment on their late night Happy Hour after 9 PM in the bar area.  I will have to try the regular restaurant some other time if we ever go back.  The hostesses were nice, showed us exactly where the bar area was in no time.  Seats were open, and we were told to sit anywhere in the bar for Happy Hour.  We chose a nice little table towards the wall section.  Our waitress was quick, and asked if we were interested in some drinks or if we were going to stick around for Happy Hour.  We told her we indeed there for Happy Hour and were immediately offered one of their bar plate menus.  

There are a decent number of dishes available during Happy Hour, around 10 or so.  The pricing is good, between $4 - $6 each.  There are a number of drink specials as well.

I stuck with a Peroni beer for $4, not exactly a value, but apparently it's cheaper than normal.  Really?  Damn markup must be massive!  The wifey and I wanted to share the Black Pepper Shrimp plate, but according to our waitress they were out of the cream sauce for it.  Huh?  How hard is it for a kitchen to whip up a cream sauce exactly?  I certainly hope you have an ITALIAN kitchen that can make cream sauces all day long!  Alfredo, anyone?  Was just beyond me but OK.  We opted for the Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip instead.  We also got an order of Beef Carpaccio, and two BRIO burgers.

Plates took around 20 minutes to arrive, average for most restaurants.  But it wasn't exactly busy when we were there so I don't know what the holdup was.  I gotta say though that our plates weren't exactly news to write home about.  Yes, I know it's Happy Hour, and yes I know the pricing is considered 'cheap', but come on now.  These were some ugly looking plates!  Poorly executed for the most part.  The Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip with flatbread triangles was alright.  It seemed to be sitting under the heat lamp for a bit on the long side, top layer of it was hard.  It tasted ok, but should I be ashamed to say it tastes like something I can pick up at Costco?  Let me get on with the BRIO burger.  Wow.  $5 for this?  A thin burger patty with Provolone and roasted tomato mayo on what looks like a Costco hamburger bun?  And a side of housemade 'chips', once again, that could be from Costco?  Now before you get your panties in a twist, I adore Costco and shop there weekly (and drink a kale shake almost daily).  I'm just saying, if I can make the same stuff from ingredients at Costco, why go to Brio?  Why?  And this BRIO burger was plated funny too.  A 5-year old can make a plate better than this.  The burger, no lettuce, no tomato?  Cut into four pieces, and chips stuffed in the middle of the plate?  Rookies!  It didn't taste the greatest either.  Burger was overcooked and dry, the cheese was near non-existent, the roasted tomato mayo was barely there, and there was too much bun!  For the price I could have gone to Wendy's right nearby and gotten a bigger burger.  Just so-so for me.  The best item of the night was the Beef Carpaccio.  Ultra thin slices of raw beef, topped with dressed field greens, capers, a mustard aioli, and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano.  This plate was DELICIOUS.  Beef was nice and cold, greens had great crunch, capers and the mustard aioli added a nice bite, and the cheese gave it an extra layer of flavor.  We heartily ate this up.  All for $4!  Next time I won't waste any effort and just get two orders of carpaccio.  And maybe a Peroni.

Rant done Brio."}
{"text":"We got there at 11, just as they opened do there was nobody there. That was awesome! Our server was awesome too. He never let our glasses get empty, brought our appetizer out almost immediately, was ready to make suggestions on lunch, and brought out a dessert to celebrate my birthday after my hubby made sure he knew we were celebrating! The food was delicious! We loved the spinach and artichoke dip. The meals hit the spot too. The Alfredo sauce was super-rich and I couldn't finish it. My hubby also filled up in the dip so he couldn't finish his club sandwich. Yummy leftovers!!"}
{"text":"We go here often and have had pretty much everything on the menu.  Great food, good service with friendly wait staff.  Bartenders are cool also when we sit in the lounge for happy hour which has good deals also!!  Can't go wrong here with a 5 star rating!!"}
{"text":"I've been 4 times now.  I continue to have a \"meh\" opinion.  Food is OK.  Certainly overpriced.  Comparable in quality to other chain Italian joints but higher in price.

The service is always great and the happy hour is really nice.  Worth a visit but don't expect GREAT food."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful experience tonight- sat outside to enjoy a glass of wine and appetizer- our waiter was the best- so polite and professional.
Clifton made our experience special!
Love going out and being able to enjoy the beautiful outdoors.
Thanks Clifton ~ we will be back soon and will hope to have you with us again."}
{"text":"When I hit up Vegas I don't usually hit up restaurants.  I know some of you are probably thinking... Why not?  Don't they have tons of great restaurants out in the City of Gluttony?   True that... But!  Remember!  This is also home to endless scrumptious buffets as well!  How can I let that slide right?  Ok... so I ended up at a restaurant this time around... Buffets I'll see you on my next trip.

Stopped by this hidden shopping plaza near the South end of the strip... Yes!  There is one real nice shopping mall and it's not an outlet!  (Town Square)  This plaza is totally nice and especially during the winter time coz it's got such a cozy feel to it... since we were looking for food, we came, we searched, and we landed at Brio Tuscan Grille.

Initially I thought I wasn't going to like it, but I'm glad that I was wrong.  Let me tell you why this is definitely a place that I'd go back again...

Décor:  Awesome!  Interior design at this place rivals those at the Grand Lux café except much fancier!  Dim, beautiful lighting, and awesome outdoor patio with a fire pit for a nice little gathering should you have a large party.

Food was actually more tastier than I was expecting...  Here were just the few that I've sampled

-Calamari:  Flash fried to perfection with aioli dipping sauce, yum!
-Penne Gorgonzola:   Off the hook good with just the right amount of sauce
-Fettuccine Rustica:  Just ok... not enough sauce for my taste
-Chipotle Chicken and Bacon Panini:  One of the best sandwiches I've had!  The bread was toasted beyond perfection to a point that it is crispy yet chewy!!! Not sure how that happened but I really need to try more paninis and see if they all taste this good!  Then the chipotle flavor coupled with load of chicken was just awesome!  (Yes, this was my dish!)

Service was wonderful too!  Water was always filled to the rim without requesting them to come by to do so, and they also allow dogs to be right by the gate so our buddies can share some food with us!  (not inside but at least near us)

Price:  Very reasonable!  Majority of the dishes for lunch runs no more than $15 and good portions too!

If you are in the Sin City and craving Italian, do help your wallet a favor by giving this place a visit instead of some fancy Italian joint inside the casino... you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"So glad we ended up here last night!

We started off at Texas De Brazil but the wait was over and hour and a half! Then we tried Tommy Bahamas and they were closed for a private event!

Finally we happened upon Brio and their wait was over an hour!

We slipped into the bar and as fate would have it a table was getting up to leave right as we walked in!! So we swooped the table like the stealthy women we are and all was right with the world.

We had an amazing server! We had a few drinks and I have to say their Raspberry Mojito is a must try!

We started with the Carpaccio appetizer and it was absolutely heavenly. Like I'm crazing it right now at 8:00AM just writing about it good.

For our main course we had the Steak salad and the Salmon salad. Both were ginormous portions and incredibly tasty. Neither of us were able to finish them and we left incredibly satisfied!

This will definitely be a go to for girls night!"}
{"text":"Wooo, very great food and great service. Thank you Mary! I applied a coupon on yelp, then I ordered a tomato mozzarella(appetizer) dish which is good for diet( low calorie). And it was very delicious! After lunch, I was told the lunch was $0 balance! A surprise!   I will definitely come back with my friends and highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Loved loved loved it. Great treatment, great food and atmosphere! A top favorite of ours to visit and order delivery from with #doordash."}
{"text":"Great meal. I had the shrimp and crab cakes. They were a bit small but quite tasty. If you are very hungry, I would order an appetizer first. The spinach and artichoke dip was very good. A little on the pricey side but well worth it for a nice lunch meal."}
{"text":"They have an awesome happy hour, but unfortunately we missed it by 5 minutes. No one else's fault but ours. I had a corona and my husband had a couple long islands. The bbq chicken flat bread was good, nothing special. This place kind of never hits the spot for me, and the food is always just O.K. This time we even knew the assistant manager but it didn't help that the restaurant was so crowded and servers looked a little overwhelmed. I really like the atmosphere thought, so might go back again for happy hour."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant food is great . My advice is don't sit outside , there were Pigeons all around our table , so gross ugh .Their Sangrias suck they are so bitter my friend had to doctor hers up not cool ."}
{"text":"I have lived in Europe and wanna-be-Italian restaurants in the States are just always disappointing to me. The only thing I liked there was the fresh bread. My husband ordered the grilled salmon over angel hair pasta and I had the risotto. The grilled salmon was very plain and almost dry.. really nothing special. A small piece of salmon over a bed of pasta... The risotto almost made me cry.. It had BACON in it! The bacon flavor was so overwhelming I really couldn't eat it. Don't give me wrong I do like bacon BUT not in ITALIAN risotto... Thats just wrong! Sorry! Service wasn't perfect either.. We paid about $40 for 2 people (small appetizer included) no drinks and I left the restaurant hungry and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"The staff is always very attentive and the food is solid. There is nothing amazing about this restaurant it's consistent. I feel this 
may be my most ambivalent review yet but I am just not moved emotionally either way on Brio. I will go pro vs con and see if that helps. 
Pro . Nice beef carpaccio 
con. Not many anti-pasta you would expect. Marinated Veg, Charcuterie, or maybe roasted carciofi 
pro. Nice size pasta bowl 
con. Although I love Ricotta and Vodka sauce this dish was a little 
blah. 
pro. Outdoor seating 
con. chair was so tight and uncomfortable I found myself fidgeting the whole time
pro. Cold Peroni and glass
con. Dirty glass
pro. location is very convinent
con. Chain(BBRG)
I am gonna go with 3 strong stars just can't go 4 on this one."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Town Square to return some items, a friend and I decided to eat lunch at Brio Tuscan Grill. It was around noon on a Friday, and since there was a wait to sit inside we decided to sit on the patio. 

The overall attitude of the hostess worried me a bit... She wasn't welcoming, did not try to engage us in any conversation, walked way ahead of us, and did not check to see if we were ok with the table she put us at. And we weren't, as soon as our waiter came to take our drink orders we asked to be moved to an area that was slightly shaded. 

After checking over the menu I was unable to decide so I decided to ask  our waiters to help. We had multiple waiters, one was being trained by the other. Between the snooty hostess and trainee-waiter this could have been a disastrous lunch but thankfully the waiters  did a great job together. They convinced me to to try the citrus garden salad with shrimp. My friend had  the mezza chicken under the brick. 

The bread did not come out until after our food, but our food did come out pretty quickly. My salad was huge, had lots of perfectly cooked shrimp and the linguine was surprisingly good, which made me happy since I was worried I wouldn't like noodles on a salad. The dressing was a light lemon vinaigrette, and the dried cranberries and pecans were nice compliments to the cilantro and peppers. 

Based on how quickly she devoured it, I think the mezza chicken under the brick was pretty good as well! 

Total damage for our 2 lunches and 2 ice teas was right around $30 before tip. I am looking forward to visiting Brio again during happy hour."}
{"text":"My first time to Brio Tuscan Grille.  I know, I know...I've been missing out.  I love me some Italian food, even though I don't get to eat it much.  Based on their menu, there's enough of a selection for everyone.  

There's even a \"Lighter Side Menu\", which I chose to partake in. Lighter side choices range from lean steaks, chicken, salmon, salads, and some white fish (i.e. Mahi Mahi and Tilapia). Of course, I went with their 5 oz Filet Brio.  This was served with asparagus and sweet potato.  You can't go wrong with grilled asparagus and their sweet potato was amazing.  My only issue with both...wish I had more.  As for their 5 oz filet, I had this cooked medium-well.  In the last 2 weeks I've had steak at least 3 other times at well respected steakhouses.  No joke...I think Brio's was up there in tenderness, taste, and presentation.  My entree was less than 400 calories and a little over $20.  Bang for your buck without a bang on your nutrition!

The ambiance was great. You gotta love the tall ceilings.  Our server was great as well. I know that this is an Italian restaurant and I didn't get anything Italian.  But their steaks are good and for that alone, I am a fan.

{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went here for restaurant week and this was a good choice. The deal was good and the food portion wad a lot, we took food home so that's always a good thing. For appetizer we had the tomato bisque and the bruchetta. For the main course we had the lobster and shrimp pasta and rock fish they were both good. For dessert she had the termusu and I had the cheesecake. Food was so good we will come again for sure."}
{"text":"Started with the Lobster Bisque which had just the right zing of spice followed by a caramelized pork chop cooked to perfection. My lovely wife had the Mushroom Ravioli de Bello which was outstanding. The seating in this restaurant and outside patio was spacious with space to pull out your chairs without touching the adjacent guests. Service in the restaurant was fast but not so much in the bar. Overall it was a great value and experience."}
{"text":"We were looking on Yelp for a good seafood restaurant near the Phoenix Mayo Clinic tonight and found Brio Tuscan Cafe had good reviews. Not only that, but Yelp offered a free appetizer. We were so glad we tried it! Our appetizer, Roasted Garlic, Spinach and Artichoke Dip, was yummy, and our entrees were uniquely prepared, presented, and delicious. I had the Grilled Salmon Fresco, and my husband had Shrimp Verduta. Can't wait to return and try some of their other wonderful options!"}
{"text":"Nice Italian place. Food is nice, service is amazing, and my girlfriend and I all had a great night at here. Thank you Brio."}

{"text":"Matt r was a great server it was my first time coming and had a great experience to be honest we were going to Texas day Brazil but for some stupid reason they're closed at lunchtime on Mondays and Tuesdays so we ended up here and it was probably better the Hostess were hot too 


Back again and LOVE jessica from Ohio.  Great service.  So friendly.  She was so nice I'm not even gonna leave the comment part about how they messed up my pasta and it came out 15 minutes later....    oppps just did.   But the food and service was great"}
{"text":"Indulged in happy hour today! Great drinks and very reasonably priced appetizers (under $3) until 6:30 at the bar, who could ask for anything more? The bar was busy, but finding seating was not too difficult. The service was great and bartenders attentive. We tried about half of the appetizers on the happy hour menu and all were great! The steak brochette, their version of the shrimp cocktail, breaded ravioli's exceptional. I had a Bellini (which is a frozen drink at Brio), which was perfect sitting at the patio bar on a warm evening. Brio is going on the \"must frequently visit\" list!"}
{"text":"We went to this location on Christmas Eve we were celebrating our anniversary. Everything was good but later that evening I got really sick! Violently sick! My husband called and told them but we have not got any kind of response back! I would not recommend going there!"}
{"text":"Beef carpaccio, lobster bisque, any of their salads. Awesome happy hour. Mmmmm bellinis! Chocolate peanut butter pie! Now I want brio!"}
{"text":"Planned on dinner with the hubby tonight and we sat in a booth in the bar area.  Waitress takes 10 mins to come by.  This should have been my first clue.  We ordered water. We finally are able to order about 20 minutes in.  We ordered an app and 2 entrees. Oh and the app is free cause I used the yelp check in. As we are waiting and starving another 1/2 hour goes by and still no food. Then the power goes out. I see the waitress tend to all the other tables and I'm trying to flag whoever I can in the dark for an update. The hostess walks by on her cell phone and she said that they are still cooking food. Another 10 mins go by and still no food and I see the waitress on her cell phone and tending to the tables outside. Now the tables around us, the waiter places candle so they can see but not our table. I started to get up to talk to the manager and as soon as I got up she ran over. She said that she's been busy with the tables outside. And I said that we are sitting in the dark not knowing what's going on. She said last time this happened it took 3 hrs for power to get back on and that they are not cooking any food now and we could wait. So almost an hour in, we get up, starving and leave.  I know the power outage is not her fault however the extremely poor service is no excuse. So the one star is for the awful service."}
{"text":"great food..spicy shrimp with egg plant and lamb chaps are amazing"}
{"text":"Love to come here for HH and all their great appi's. Tonight was first time coming for dinner and we were not disappointed.  Our waiter, Danny was personable and attentive and only here to make everything to our pleasing. The spicy shrimp and eggplant appetizer is our favorite and what keeps bringing us back. And we love to bring our out of town guests in to enjoy it as well. Enjoyed Danny and the whole staff!  Thank you."}
{"text":"Last Sunday I paid $70 to get good food and horrendous service. I guess if you're ever on the run from the cops and want to hide in plain view then sitting at the bar top at Brio in Gilbert could be a very viable option for you. I even reached and emailed their corporate office and not surprisingly I did not receive a follow email or call. I will certainly not be returning here."}
{"text":"Service was lacking. It seemed like our table
Didn't matter. We ordered food the waiter didn't remember and we never got. We had to keep asking for things and he would never remember. It seemed like our money wasn't important enough. The floor ma anger came by with the same lame concern. Wasn't good enough. 

Finally got food, SALTY, Salty, salty! Yuk. I love Brio, but Town Square has better service, and food was much better."}
{"text":"Very nice (read fancy) ambiance, even in the bar area.

My BFF and I came here for dinner one night. The raviolis were sooo good. My BFF had the chicken pomodoro, but since she's a vegetarian they had no problem subing in eggplant (which she said was delicious). Their raspberry cosmo is really good, and not too strong. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. All in all a great visit. We'll be here again!"}
{"text":"A much better place than CPK. 
The food quality is better and the customer service as well. 
AND THEY HAVE RAVIOLI!!! I love their fettuccines. The flavor, texture, everything is perfect. My favorite is their artichoke dip appetizers. Omg, i get this every time before i order our entrees. I am a very loyal customer so once you get me going, i will return. And this is my second time here. 
My first time was the best. The waiter was also the server and he looked like he enjoyed working there. If i was able to request who my waiter is, and if I remembered his name, i would have done it in a heartbeat. Unfortunately, i cant because the second time, the customer service was so off. My waiter was great and friendly, but my server was not. He just threw the bread onto the table(it even slid upwards). Like wtf? Crapper server. Pissed me off. And then when he brought my dish, he left the plate half hanging off the table in front of me. It could have easily fallen all onto me but I grabbed it and pushed it in. Something he should have done because I can easily burn myself from that. Usually, all the waiters will tell you to not touch the plate. This guy just leaves it half hanging from the table and expect you to take care of it yourself. Also, when he came to pay time, i waited for a long while and had to ask someone else if I can get the check and to go box. :/ my waiter just disappeared on us. 

However, i will still leave this a 5/5 because i personally love all the other waiters. Especially the waiter from our first time being here. He was so ecstatic to serve us and take our order. He has really good opinions on what to eat and everything. The food itself has always been delicious. The first and the second time, I can honestly say I rather go to brio than cpk. The pricing is only $2-$5 more expensive than cpk but its also $2-$5 worth more than cpk.

*edited, changed it to 4/5 since the manager here completely avoided my concern about how the server during my second visit was rude."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at the quantity and quality of food here.  The kids meal portions are HUGE!  I cannot see a kid actually finishing their meal here.  Though I thought the food here was a bit on the salty side, the food was tasty.  Service was average.  Prices a little on the high-side."}
{"text":"Love the decor in this restaurant- it makes it seem very upscale and authentic to European cuisine. However, the prices are too steep and portions are too small (compared with the nearby Maggiano's). The service is nice and the complimentary bread has some variety, which makes it quite interesting. Here are some dishes we've tried:
- Pasta Brio: the most unique of the bunch & quite tasty
- Shrimp & Lobster Fettuccine: rich sauce, would've liked more seafood though
- Campanelle Carbonara: slightly disappointing and very run-of-the-mill flavor"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable price, good ambience.  Always some talent to see. I would recommend either a Friday for the bustling energy or the happy hour specials. Best time to be here.  I will have to say that the service could be better."}
{"text":"I love this place. Its good simple Italian Food, drinks are great and the service is on top of it. The moment you walk in they are very welcoming and happy. 

The Best: Food Food Food
I love a simple pasta with great service.
My girlfriend and I especially enjoy the desserts! Lava Cake! Amazing

Brio Rocks"}
{"text":"Was okay.. Very generic menu . Entrees do not come with a starter salad or soup.. Service was okay had to ask waitress for Parmesan .. Not attentive and felt like we were avoided  and rushed"}
{"text":"I love the little shopping center in Tivoli Village.  Patio seating, bar, and regular dining is offered.  I came here expecting Italian food (my usual is the lobster & shrimp ravioli) but went with the 5 oz. filet instead.  It was cooked perfectly - honestly one of the best steaks I've had!  It cut through like butter, the flavor was amazing, and I gobbled it down.  The portions are really small at Brio.  I was expecting my plate to be a bit more loaded for the price I pay compared to hole in the wall Italian restaurants found in Las Vegas.  I'm not talking about the filet, but the pasta dishes are rather small.  Otherwise my experience was positive from the food, the server, and the restaurant setting."}
{"text":"My wife and I received a gift card to Brio and since we had heard great things from a few people we decided to stop in for a quick dinner. 

We only had an hour due to a conference call that was scheduled for 6:30pm. When we arrived we told the waitress that we were short on time and ready to order right away. She seemed annoyed at us and said something like \"well I'm taking drink orders now.\" I replied that she could get our drink and food order at the same time. She seemed miffed!

We ordered the bruschetta sampler to start, thinking it would come out quickly. It did! The bruschetta was for the most part pretty good and a good value. It wasn't as authentic as I would have hoped - the chef's seem to decide what they think bruschetta is themselves. We might be a bit biased because my wife and I had sampled bruschetta all over Italy during our honeymoon in October. Bruschetta = B+

I don't even remember what we ordered for a main meal, which we decided to split (another goofy look from the waitress)... What we got was plain pasta and a brick of over cooked chicken-something. The good news was it came out fast. The bad news was it wasn't worth eating. I was too hungry and in too much of a hurry to send it back so we choked it down, refused dessert, got our check and left. 

I hope to try Brio again some day. All of my friends said our experience wasn't typical so maybe we just caught a bad waitress on a bad day, and a bad cook on a bad day. It could happen, right? 

Oh and one more thing. I'm only 155lbs and the chairs on the patio squeezed the crap out of my rear end. Those are the most uncomfortable chairs I have ever sat in. Unless you are 110lbs you should sit inside. Come to think of it - maybe they did that for a reason to keep the skinny people on the patio and the \"regular\" people hidden inside. :)"}
{"text":"Our server, Robert, was great. He knew just when to approach our table and when to give us a moment to have our dinner and socialize with our friends. I would give 5 starts if the salmon salad I had was better. The salmon portion was delicious. However, the salad portion needs some changes... for one, the asparagus still has its stalks and therefore you had to spit out chunks of the end instead of being able to consume it whole. The salad was also a bit mushy... I'm not sure how to change this, but if it can be done, I would highly recommend it. And lastly, the forks can use an upgrading. I was thankful to have an extra fork to use when the first one felt as though the prongs were bent in different ways... unfortunately, the second was similar in fashion although not as severe. 
That being said, the atmosphere was great! We'll be back and I'd love to try a different dish."}
{"text":"I ordered through door dash and had it delivered. I had the camponelle carbonara, nothing special about the dish, the Alfredo sauce is very bland, greasy, and basic. There was barely any chicken and for the price, proportions are very small. You are better off going to the Cheesecake Factory for pasta. The calamari frito misto is overpriced and basic. I love calamari and this is probably the worst I've had. There wasn't even lemon to squeeze on the calamari. Everything is overpriced honestly except for the kids meals. The best thing they have is dessert, both of their cheesecakes specifically. The tiramisu is dry and awful."}
{"text":"1. I love that they now have a GF menu. 
2. I love their shrimp and crab cakes (not GF but worth cheating with)
3. Staff is always friendly, helpful and on time.
4. Beautiful terrace seating in the Summer."}
{"text":"This location is great after a few hours of shopping.   Since we were there fairly early, we were able to sit out on the terrace which was really nice.  Trevor was our server and was there promptly to take our drink and food order.  He mentioned fresh bread would be coming out of the oven in 3 minutes and sure enough, it came out piping hot and fresh.

I had the lasagna, which is a huge order and came out hot and gooey, just like I like it.   My husband had the veal milanese with a side of linguini Pomodoro.   The veal was very tasty, and the only complaint he had was that his food was not very hot.

All in all, good choice.    Service was excellent and food was very good."}
{"text":"Brio Crocker Park was disappointing November 18th.  The lobster bisque was too salty, very thick and fishy smelling and tasting.  Three of us sent it back to the kitchen.

The shrimp and eggplant appetizer (which I've ordered before) was horrible.  Again, the shrimp salty, overly-seasoned, and the shrimp were over-cooked, shriveled-up little things,  lacking taste.The sauce - drowned the shrimp & eggplant- and was meh.

Not returning to this location.  Legacy Village will be my go to from now on.  Or, until a new head cook is hired!"}
{"text":"We had a luncheon for a friend's birthday today at 11:30am and all went well. I had an appetizer the shrimp and eggplant - it was delicious.  2 waiters were great. I think I would give 5 stars if we didn't have to ask for bread and coffee. The parking garage is a bit confusing and seemed to be busy today.  We had a few empty chairs, but 11 people is a good size group.
Thank you Brio staff for a good lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Booked my 8 year anniversary dinner at Brio via their website which linked to Open Table. I made a note that it was a special occasion AND called and spoke to one of the hostesses around 5pm advising of this.
The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, if a bit loud for a romantic dinner. The spinach artichoke dip was the best I've had, the desserts were amazing, the drinks were well made, and we were asked by two managers how everything was. All good things.
Unfortunately, I ordered the shrimp and lobster (I think) pasta that was pretty bland and did taste like it could have come from Olive Garden. My wife ordered a chicken risoto which she seemed to like. 
Overall it was good, but nothing special was offered, nothing was comped even with ordering 4 drinks, 2 main courses, and 2 desserts. I even wrote \"Anniversary?\" on the credit card slip hoping it may prompt a call back. It didn't.
My overall feeling: so close, yet so far- especially for the $110 we spent."}
{"text":"Went here for afternoon drinks and appetizers. Our server Andy was super nice! The outdoor atmosphere was perfect for a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Both the food and peach bellinis were delicious!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I received a gift card to brio and we decided to try this place out for an early Valentine's Day lunch. Everything from the ambiance to the service was fantastic! The decorations all around were beautiful, and the high ceilings with the curtains really caught my eye. 

Our server, Cortney, did an amazing job coursing out our food and handled all of our requests. 
We had calamari and the shrimp & eggplant for appetizers. The runner who brought them out even said they were the two best things on the menu for appetizers, and he was right! The shrimp and eggplant had a peppercorn sauce and grated cheese. SO DELICIOUS. And the calamari had fried peppers in it and came with two sauces, one that was tomato based and the other mayonnaise. For entrees, my boyfriend had crab stuffed shrimp and lobster tail. He didn't care for the orzo and broccoli on the side, but I found it delightful! It also came with lobster bisque!!! And I love lobster bisque. I had the chicken limone. Delicious was an understatement. It was seasoned perfectly & nice and tender. I am so sad that I was too full from the apps to finish it, but at the same time, i can't wait to warm it up later  Cortney boxed up our calamari and my chicken and even gave us to go sauce for the calamari. Her kind smile and great service really made our first time experience a great one! 

Overall, from the low prices, big entrees, cute decor, and amazing service, we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Brio a few times for happy hour, full-on dinner, and just drinks when shopping at Town Square. As another reviewer mentioned, I am not especially 'jazzed' to be writing a review for a chain like this.. but it is what it is. 

Had this never been a part of Town Square I would not ever have heard of it I don't believe. So having said that.. I had come in for dinner a few times. I am that guy when it comes to a non-belief in \"American Style Italian\" or whatever Brio claims to be.

As for the quality of the food.. it isn't bad.. just nothing spectacular. Lately My friends and I have been dropping in for Happy hour on Thursdays as they have a $5 'martini' menu along side their daily happy hour of $2.95 'Tuscan Tasters'' .. 

The thing is, they get so swamped with customers during happy hour, that the service gets seriously patchy. I'm totally down for someone hustling amongst the tables they are waiting on, just trying to do the job and make some descent money.. in fact I can appreciate it. It's the consistent mistakes on the bill, the negative attitude, especially fromt he bar staff, and the disregard for any style of customer service from the staff. There is constant conversation about everything but work, and in a very loud way. 

I honestly know that this is literally a step in some direction from a place like 'Chili's\" or 'Friday's\" but with the environment of a bit higher end restaurant that they are trying to create.. you would hope for more is all I am saying. 

In the end of it all, I would be back for the Happy Hour.. as it's good prices and descent nosh when you are shopping or heading to a movie.. but I think I will be looking for other options when I am next down at Town Square. Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"We always enjoy our dining experience here...
I love the atmosphere-the high vaulted ceilings,the lighting,outside seating is neat too accompanied by a fire pit for those chilly nights. It is so pretty inside like you are about to be a witness at a wedding!!!
The service is quick & I never encountered  a rude employee (yet)...

This place is one of the few places that my daughter enjoys (too picky)!!!
There hasn't been a dish that I have sent back. The bread basket is not only filled with soft bread but you get crispy flat bread with sesame seeds as well...The Pasta Fra Diavolo (Spicy Shrimp wih Angel hair pasta), Cheese Ravioli, Ravioli Caprese(Crispy Cheese Ravioli) & the Wedge Salad are just a few of our favorites. 
I just tried Fettuccine Napoli which has Smoked chicken,carmelized onions, broccoli, tomatoes,& chili flakes. The chili flakes is what sold me and sadly, I felt these chili flakes were just flakes minus all the chili. Not spicy at all-what happened ? I also had to add salt (I hate having to add salt to anything).
So even though this dish was a miss for me I can still appreciate that just because this is a good restaurant doesn't mean you are going to like everything. Brio can tend to be pricey....
We will be back...."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Food is always amazing and the Lobster Bisque is seriously addicting it is soooo good!! Gustavo the executive sous chef has gone out of his way to accommodate my sometimes very particular requests! We have always had great service but a huge shout out to Valentina who did such an amazing job and was so sweet! Probably one of the best servers we have ever had!!"}
{"text":"I went here last night for a business dinner and was quite impressed. Our table had the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant appetizer as well as the assorted Bruschetta Quattro - YUM!!  We were also treated like royalty, I might add, by the staff. Of course, it probably didn't hurt that one of my new co-workers used to work with the General Manager! LOL

For dinner, I ordered the Citrus Chicken w/Shrimp Scampi and Orzo. Wowwee wow! Tasty - went well with our bottles of White Oak Chardonnay. 

I didn't have any dessert (I'm trying to lose 7 lbs), but did try my new director's Creme Brulee and it was HEAVEN in a dish!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friends birthday.  It was about 12 of us in total.  Everything started off great until it was time to recognize the birthday boy.  (I'm going to rewind about an hour into our dining there was a birthday party in front of or table. About 4 waiters sang happy birthday and lit the birthday dessert as well as clapped and celebrated which is what I've always been accustomed to when parties are being celebrated at restaurants). Proceeding with our dining it was time to celebrate our birthday boy with the same song and excitement.  1. Our waiter LIED and said the restaurant DOES NOT SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO GUESTS.  2. THEY BROUGHT OUT HIS CUPCAKE, QUIETLY SO PPL AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE TABLE DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT HAD BEEN BROUGHT OUT. The reason this irritates me is don't lie to me after I just witnessed your courtesy to other patrons and don't hush hush a celebration that was shared at your establishment.  3 stars because the food was good.. took long to come out though.  No refills on drinks,  waiter seemed overwhelmed and irritated.. felt rushed out even though people were still ordering desserts.. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I've had several very enjoyable meals here in the past.  I would strongly suggest the spinach artichoke appetizer!  I've never been disappointed!

My mom and I decided to stop for a snack while we were in Town Square.  We tried the tasters menu...$2.95 each.  So good!  We had the raviolis and baked mozzarella brushetta.  Very satisfying!  Hit the spot!  Nice little portions, perfect for splitting.  We agreed ordering 1 or 2 more would've made for a filling meal.  

We both really enjoyed the food and portion sizes.  However, our favorite part of coming here was the service!  You have to sit in the bar or outside on the couches to order the tasters menu.  We sat at the bar and actually had 3 different bartenders waiting on us!  Each was more pleasant than the next!  Very nice to have attentive service!  Each of us are planning on inviting co-workers or friends for a happy hour to enjoy the tasters."}
{"text":"Tried Brio for the first time tonight. It was good. I very much enjoyed my dinner and the atmosphere. Came in around 6:15pm and we were seated right away. Our waitress was attentive and got our drinks out quickly. I tried the berry acai Italian soda which was just okay, I probably would not get it again.

The bread that was brought out before our entrees was very good. A combination of sourdough and a crispy baked focaccia type cracker bread. My sister and I both had Caesar salads before our meal and they were great. I ordered the pasta fra diavolo which had campanelle pasta with a spicy vodka cream sauce and chicken. I asked for it extra spicy and it was delicious. My sister had the ravioli di bello which was a portabella mushroom ravioli with a mushroom cream sauce, I tried it and it was also very tasty. 

Service was great throughout the meal. Food was wonderful. Prices are moderate but worth it. Overall good. I will be back."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I'd been to Brio twice before (once here and once in California) and this time, out with friends, will probably be my last time. While our waitress was very nice, she was forever missing in action and when she would take our table of 8 drink orders, she'd return with only 5-6 drinks, the others would sit thirsty. We'd flag her down and politely ask if our drinks were coming and she's look through her notepad and look confused, then 10 minutes later deliver our remaining drinks to our parched friends. Salads and appetizers ordered, again, a salad is missing and as two of the three appetizers are brought to the table, the third elusive appetizer never arrives. Meal orders placed, all miraculously arrive. I ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo, which, by its name alone signifies it is a spicy dish. Ugh, no. Quite flavorless honestly. Bland as the napkin on my lap. My husband ordered the Under the Brick (or something like that) Chicken, he said it was not very good, again, lacking in flavor and depth, he was disappointed. Other items ordered was steak which was said to taste very gamey and sat on the plate next to the watery mashed potatoes. Lobster and Shrimp raviolis were said to be okay, but not fantastic. The friend who ordered the Blackened Tilapia said it was very good, however the plate next to her was the Chicken Milanese was not good at all, overly salted and dry. 
Our check took forever to be delivered. Once we paid it was $113 per couple, including a cocktail each. I usually am not super high maintenance, but I felt like I had to beg for a refill of water or the check. The food was not toothsome as one would hope. Big let down."}
{"text":"Three separate times my girlfriend and I have had issues here.

1. We came on a day when the restaurant was fairly empty, maybe 5 tables in the whole place. Food took forever, waitress would disappear for a long time.  Everyone has an off day but this did leave a sour taste.

2. My girlfriend wanted to have her birthday party so we wanted to go visit the restaurant and while there set up the party. We arrived and the wait was 45+ minutes.  No biggie but we didn't have time to wait.  She asked if the manager was available to discuss a party of 20+.  The hostess was extremely rude. Had she said, \"I am sorry, the manager is busy right now so may I take your information?\" then that would have been fine.  But she was like \"The manger will not see you right now. We are in the middle of dinner rush.\" in a very rude voice.  We called later and the manager said he would have been happy to see us and that she was indeed being rude.  He did not try to salvage the party reservation.

3. Last night we went again. It started off great with the waiter seeing to our needs. We got our appetizer and soup and then he disappeared for a long time. When he returned he informed us that he had forgotten to put in our dinner order.  He took off one soup, which was nice of him, but in this situation the manager should have visited the table.  We were there for a long time and left with a bad taste in our mouth.

We love the lobster bisque but will not return."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been to Brio twice in 2013 and loved it both times! Unfortunately, this year was a major let down. We were quickly seated upon arrival...and that's when the speedy service came to a halt! We waited ten minutes before the server came for our drinks order. Upon receiving our drinks, we quickly placed our food order. During our wait, we received a basket of stale, old bread, which stayed at our table until we were finished with our meals...it was a waste basket by this time, but the server left it there anyway.

At this point, our expectations were low. And when our food finally arrived 35 minutes later, we were even more disappointed. My wife ordered the rather expensive Beef Medallions, which she had order before and loved. The presentation was sloppy and the food was simply flavorless! It tasted neither good nor bad. I ordered the the Carbonara...an Italian classic. It was mediocre at best. I would compare it to perfectly microwaved Marie Calendar!

I do NOT recommend this restaurant. The only good thing about our time was the conversation we shared with each other...we can pay a lot less money for good conversation."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior.  Nice patio area.  Staff was very nice.  our food was very good.  Our server had nice suggestions, everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Went into Brio the other night as SQ is close to home.  The restaurant was very nice looking and being as it was happy hour I took a seat at the bar.  The bar staff was very friendly and I was happy to find out they had some awesome deals for happy hour.  I tried their shrimp and eggplant appetizer and it was amazing.  I'm not usually a big veggie guy but between the shrimp and sauce this dish is delicious.  The bread was warm and fresh and I ended up using too much of it to sop up the sauce from the appetizer dish and made myself full.  Can't wait to come back and try more."}
{"text":"Our waitress was awesome!  She had us right at a little table next to the bar at a couch where I could put my feet up.  They were busy back there making drinks, yet she was super attentive and down-to-earth.  I had the margherita pizza and it was heavenly.  My husband had a pasta dish that was amazing and I kept stealing his side of vegetables.  The bruschetta is amazing too!  This is a great place to stop any time of day if you are doing a little shopping in Town Square."}
{"text":"The staff goes out of their way to make sure we have a positive dining experience. Servers are always pleasant and attentive. The kids menu has excellent and well priced options. Thanks Brio for feeding us!"}
{"text":"The service was great, very attentive to our needs.  The food was fabulous, flavorful and elegant.   Cooked to perfection.   We had the Gorgonzola created steak medallions and spicy shrimp with eggplant.   If we lived closer I'd eat here all the time.   Way to go Brio crew, Chris was our waiter and did an excellent good meeting our needs."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant! I probably eat here 2-4 times a month (especially happy hour, can never go wrong with happy hour), it's just that good! Once you come in, there's kind of like, an Italy-feel atmosphere. Which I love because it feels like I'm eating lunch or dinner somewhere in Italy. 

Their service is PERFECT, they're very welcoming and always introducing themselves in a friendly manner. I come here too often to the point where they recognized who I am and my order, kind of embarrassing but at the same time, am proud to be a regular! 

Unto the food, so far I've only tried their tuscan grilled pork chops, beef carpaccio (this appetizer is a MUST), filet mignon, and some pasta. ALL of it were perfectly cooked. I'm very picky when it comes to eating meat and I'm just so glad I found a restaurant that are consistent with grilling their steaks. Although, I've been ordering my usual (pork chops and carpaccio) the last couple of visits, I think it's time to expand my options, but I shouldn't have to worry about getting something that I won't like because brio never disappoints. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant.  The ambiance was wonderful. The food and service were amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance.  Amazing service. We would go back and request our server Whitney."}
{"text":"Resonable price 

Service team was challenged being short handed

Food was good for the $$

Not bad

{"text":"Nothing worse than ordering your food, going to the bathroom to wash you hands, and watching a server walk out of the bathroom stall and then walk straight back out without washing his hand and start serving people's food. While you stare at the sign that says \"all employees are required to wash their hands\" . . . . Never eating at this location again."}
{"text":"THE best Italian food . Decor and a service are 5*.Eggplant appetizer is one of my favorite ever. Everything tastes delicious."}
{"text":"Brio is one of my favorite places, especially for the Lasagna, but today was a huge disappointment! I ordered the Eggs Benedict with asparagus and potatoes. The eggs were fully cooked through, the potatoes were cold and hard, and the asparagus was dry and wilted! The best part of the meal was the Mango Mojito! If I return it will only be for the Lasagna and Mojitos!!"}
{"text":"I love Brio! We were there to celebrate my daughter's birthday last night. The restaurant is pretty the food is good but last night the service was above and beyond! Our waiter was AWESOME! He worked hard to make it a special night for my daughter and her friends!"}
{"text":"Despite the noisy open air atmosphere, I loved the food. Calamari is awesome and pasta is fresh.  Cheesecake was so-so."}
{"text":"Amazing service, fantastic food. Manager stopped by and was so pleased with how happy we were he comped our drinks as a thanks. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I've only been here for happy hour, but it's great! 3-6pm and 9-11pm, $2.95 taster menu with 8-10 items on it, drink specials on wednesdays. I've had everything on the taster menu and it's all amazing!!!  A friend and I shared 3 items and were stuffed.  I've had the pasta a la vodka, also amazing.  Definitely worth a visit!!!"}
{"text":"We came on the evening of Black Friday - there was a 20 minute wait for the indoor seating but they could seat us right away outdoors. We were hungry so we chose to brave the elements. It was a bit chilly - to be certain. We were glad for our jackets and I ordered a hot chocolate.

The decor was nice, outdoor tables could maybe use a few more heaters on the cold evenings. We loved the idea of the fire pit though it's not super comfortable for dining - better for drinks/appetizers I suspect.

We started with the ravioli appetizer. It was quite good, though perhaps could have used just a tad more tomato/marinara sauce.

I ordered the steak and I have to say it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. Perfectly cooked, much larger than I expected, perfectly seasoned.  Nicely done sides of mashed potatoes and vegetables.  Really outstanding. The rest of the table seemed to enjoy their dishes as well.

Service was friendly, professional and attentive.  He made a small mistake on the check in not crediting our free appetizer coupon but immediately recognized and fixed it with an apology.  

The only downside I can think of was it being a bit chilly, but we can't fault Brio for the weather. Look forward to going back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for my brother's birthday last night. It was my first time and I heard good reviews so I was excited. The sourdough bread and crackers they brought out first were delicious. There's a Yelp check in offer for a free appetizer with purchase, so I ordered the roasted garlic artichoke and spinach dip. So yummy! It comes with a Parmesan flatbread. For my entree I got a Caesar salad and the Fettuccine Campania (fettuccine with spicy marinara, capers, kalamata olives, basil and parmesan). Really good! I normally don't like pasta but this was an exception. I didn't like the salad, too much dressing and cheese. My brother got a mini dessert, key lime pie. Yum. It was great overall. I loved the nice decor and the bathrooms are swanky and smelled good. They have a private dining area and a type of sunroom with a fireplace."}
{"text":"We will call this Strike One. It's hard as busy parents with 3 kids to get a night out.
Came here on Friday night, Expecting it to be busy. We were told a 30 min wait for a table for 2. After about 15 mins we received a text message (great idea and system) to let us know our table was almost ready. We returned and checked in at the hostess stand. We were told we would be seated in the next 5 mins. After 30 mins had passed and everyone else waiting had been seated the hostesses overheard my wife and I discussing the wait time. Then one of the hostesses came over and asked what our name was. We told them. They went back to their screen. Then they asked us if we had checked in with them as if we had never existed. (Pretty much looking at us like we were no longer in the waiting que.) At this point it had been 45 mins since our arrival, but 30 mins since we were told we would be seated shortly. They looked at each other like we were not going to be seated anytime soon. As the 3 hostesses looked at each other like \"uh oh what do we do\" we said we will find somewhere else and we walked out."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my family and I had the worst experience eating here tonight. The only positive was the view while eating outside. The lobster bisque soup we had was not only cold but tasted terrible. Then my brother had the lasagna which was also cold and tasted terrible he couldn't eat it. My pasta had no flavor whatsoever. Very disappointed. Why was that kind of food given out. I'm just in shock."}
{"text":"Love the environment and set-up. Trendy with a bit of class. I had there egg plant apetizer and it was amazing! The sauce was great!"}
{"text":"Went here for Mothers Day with the family.  Up-scale italian food.  Service and food were good.  I would go back there again.  Check it out some time."}
{"text":"Went to Brio on 1/24th for my birthday dinner. We were seated right away with a very friendly hostess staff. The restaurant was busy for a Monday night with several large parties going on. Our waitress was outstanding and very knowledgeable concerning the menu and timeliness of expediting our food. The food was outstanding, lobster risotto and scallop risotto was very good. Thank you Brio for making my birthday so special."}
{"text":"Really 2.5 stars...

Ok. I would definitely say do not come on a holiday. We came here for Father's Day. I made reservations a good week in advance knowing that it would be busy. We were seated 10 min after our reservation time which was 11:30. Our server did take our drink order fairly quickly about 10 min after we were seated and took our food orders about 20 min after that. I knew it would be busy so I expected to have some kind of wait. We were seated right next to the kitchen and so I could see what was happening. We finally got our food around 1 pm but the part about it that bothered me was that I could see my kids pizza sitting underneath the light for a good 20-30 min. In my opinion, I feel that they should have served that pizza right away since they know it's for a kid. So we finally got our food and it seemed like everyone enjoyed their food minus my kids because the pizza was rock hard. I made a comment to the server about it but he didn't respond. Ok, it's whatever at this point. I think there should be a better system when it's a holiday or just in general. Food shouldn't be sitting underneath that hot lamp for the long anyways! Overall, service was lacking (I was trying to find my server a few times to ask about the pizza and to get refills) but we only saw him twice after he gave us our entrees. I'm assuming it's better when it's not a holiday but I would definitely skip it on a holiday."}
{"text":"I do like Brio regardless of its \"chain status.\" It has never been a disappointment to the palate. I decided to come here for lunch....I've never been! I ordered the Crab/Shrimp Cakes.....delicious! If you are starving, I wouldn't recommend this plate or you can order an appetizer if you are that hungry. There were large pieces of shrimp and it was tasty, but a lil on the small side. It came with crunchy potatoes (much like potato chips) and some zucchini, carrots, onions and red pepper mix. My favorite entree from Brio are the pork chops. Their pork chops have always been so tender and juicy...its literally to die for. Yum! As always, me and my sweet tooth....loves the creme brulee sampler. I like Brio and I can't deny it."}
{"text":"I always enjoy my time here. The food and ambiance is amazing. What I order: Artichoke Crusted Fliet Mignon with mashed potatoes, house salad, Shrimp Verduta (angel hair tossed in artichokes, shrimp, garlic, sun dried tomatoes, feta, spinach, with pesto and bread crumbs), and their white peach sangria. My family usually orders all of these and splits. My mom always asks if I want to check out other restaurants when I am back home, but I always insist on going to Brio."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been coming almost every Wednesdays for months. We come during happy hour and sit on the patio. Usually, the host is very helpful and we are sat right away. The happy hour prices are very nice, their Tomato Mozzarella salad is awesome! That's what I get all the time.
However, we do not come here for the service, that's for sure, to be honest, it is quite horrible. Which is the reason why I only put 4 stars.
I came here for dinner a few times as well, their pasta are delicious!"}
{"text":"Welp...I don't even know where to start. I have eaten at this exact location several times and always enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. Had reservations for Easter Sunday at 4pm. Really it wasn't very busy at that time. Our server had one small table and ours (party of 8). He was so odd, weird, said all the wrong things while trying to joke, put in wrong food orders, some of our food came out, others were not ready. The set up they had for larger parties was horrible...The servers have to walk by with trays over the customers heads...it was super dangerous. Just an overall bad experience and definitely will not be back here for awhile!"}
{"text":"While I love this place & the food is great as is the service, I find being seated beyond irritating. In an empty restaurant, consistently being offered the worst table because of \"server rotation\" is just unacceptable . How about customer preference?"}
{"text":"Came to Brio for their happy hour. It was Bomb Diggity! Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant is a must! Outside seating is sooo pleasant. 

As for service that depends on the person. I sat in two different areas. The first server wasn't too pleasant, but the second was phenomenal!

One BIG complaint... although outside seating is wonderful, there happy hour outside seating is not so nice... limited to about 12 - 20 people. One star off for that one."}
{"text":"I'm going to agree with my friends Stefany and Clint. 

 I must quote Clint, \"The food is medicore at best\".

We went there with my son and his wife. The last time I went to a Brio was the Town Square location, with my wife, on our second date, four years ago. It hasn't improoved in that time. 

My chopped dinner salad was a good portion, but very dry and tasteless.  My wife had the \"big\" pork chop. It was big and meaty, but very dry. My daughter in law had a chicken dish worthy of a cheap buffet. I forgot what my son ordered, but I tasted it, and it wasn't very good.

The service was very good. Our bread baket was constantly refilled, our drinks always full, and when my wife complained to the manager about her dry pork, the manager did offer a substitute, but we were already full (mostly of bread).  She did send a comp'd desert as a way of saying \"sorry\".

Even though the service was very good, I would say it was a Rich Man's Bucca Di Peppo, with smaller portions, and an alternative for a High School Date to The Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mezza Chicken Limone, and it basically was coated with an omelette. It was supposed to be a piccata, but instead of an egg wash and flour dipped chicken, it was coated in a thick layer of scrambled egg. Sent it back but was given the same again. 

I'm a big fan of piccata, and have ordered the same dish here before, but sadly they've forgotten how to make it. 

I googled an image of this dish to verify how it should be made, and there are loads of Brio images that don't include the coating of omelette. 

I'm now left disappointed and with a rumbly tumbly."}
{"text":"I come here for happy hour often and in my opinion they're the best in Vegas! Great happy hour prices, wide selection  of drinks and plates, and big portions! This location doesn't hurt either ;)"}
{"text":"I'm totally coming back here y'all, oh lord. Right off the bat, the place can be loud and busier than other restaurants, but given the location, I think this is expected. 

I came here for dinner with my mom and her friend and we started with a round of drinks at the bar. I ordered my usually Moscow Mule and was underwhelmed. Maybe it's because I had been sick a little earlier in the week, but it definitely did not rank as one of my top favorites. 

The food totally made up for the drink though!! We started with the Calamari and the Bruschetta Trio Sampler. I've never had bruschetta, but I really enjoyed it, especially the one with the prosciutto, ricotta and bell peppers. I think this was the chef special for the night, but I hope it's available for more than one night. 

For dinner, I had the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccini and WOW YALL. So good!! Slight spice, wonderfully creaminess and a portion that was out of this world ($22.50 I believe and I still took some home). 

For dessert, we had the New York Style Cheesecake and Creme Brûlée. I love me a good creme brûlée, and this was def one of the best ones I've had. I wouldn't have ever come to this restaurant on my own, so I'm really glad my mom and her friend decided to take a different route for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour which recommended by my friend that lives in Vegas but I guess we came on the wrong day because it wasnt happy hour. She said that all appetizers were $2-$3 and drinks and that was what i was hoping.....well, since we were all already here we just order some drinks and some appetizers.  Suprisingly it was not too expensive but would rather have it during happy hour though!

Pretty nice atmosphere especially the female bartenders!! They're pretty hot!! Great location which is right in the middle of the mall but the parking is horrible.  Maybe because we came here during New Years weekend, bad choice.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We've been to Brio every time we visit Vegas and never had a bad meal or service until the evening of Monday April 20th. We were disappointed with the lack luster service (if you could even call it service) and room temperature food. Cold mashed potatoes are just gross and a server that is never around is just sad. It's to bad because the food is usually awesome and in the past we loved the creme brûlée enough to make a special effort to go there when we're in town. With so many other restaurants to choose from, Brio will not be one on our list again for a long time if ever."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant numerous times over the past few years and I just can't resist coming back. Whether I'm meeting with friends for an early Sunday brunch or grabbing a quick cocktail after work during happy hour, I'm always thrilled with the quality service I receive. Not to mention, their happy hour prices are insanely cheap! My favorite combo is the red sangria and the black pepper shrimp, which are a part of the regular happy hour menu, but if you're looking to spice it up a bit, each location has their own set of chef specials so you can always try something new to please your tastebuds and add a bit more variety to your pallet."}
{"text":"My partner and I decided to give Brio a second chance. This time, our experience was so great! Our waitress was super sweet and attentive. The food and drink suggestions were accurate based on her observations.  It was a much pleasant visit.  We were very satisfied about the entirety of our food and our service.
I want to thank the general manager for taking time to make sure we were taken care of.
It made us feel welcomed and comfortable.
I will continue to give my patronage to Brio."}
{"text":"Had our friends birthday dinner here the other night and it was great. Fast service. Food was delicious. Anthony was our server and my wife and I ordered the salmon salad to share and he came out with it already split for us. Our water was refilled every time we got half way empty. Thanks for the great service Anthony! Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Went to brio for a nice dinner. it had great service (as to be expected). Server knew his \"script\" well, but didn't know much else about the dishes. I ordered the Shrimp Verduta and my girlfriend ordered the sweet potato something risotto. we also had the quattro appetizer of bruschetta.

The bruschetta was ehhh, nothing special it, was all really standard dishes. The steak one had a nasty smokey tanginess to it that i didn't like. Overall i was not impressed by any of the four types of bruschetta.

My dish was alright, i could have made something a lot better on my own. I would eat it again, but i would not order it (if that makes sense to anyone). Shrimp was cooked nicely, the sauce was just there.. it wasn't anything to tell anyone about at all.

My girlfriend's dish was wack. I didn't like it at first. It tasted a lot better as a leftover the next day. I don't think it is something i would order again or even eat if i got it for free.

This place is nice to go, but not for a romantic date. It is too loud, i would call it a step up from carraba's. It was really busy there, 20-30 minute wait for a table for 2. Next time i am going to do italian food in that area i'm going to maggiano's.

At least i had a free appetizer's ticket from the yelp event earlier this year! sweet..."}
{"text":"Love this place. I've only been twice but everyone wanted to come grab something after a movie. It was a little chilly by walked over from Harkins (nice that it's close) and we go to walk by the stores on the way. Got the lobster bisque and Cesar salad. Was great. Lots of flavor and seasoning. It was a little bit fishy but wasn't a problem. Awesome environment and just fun."}
{"text":"That is the worst food ever I ate in my life. my God chicken was raw not cooked the mash potato is cold the a asked them to switch the beans to pasta they forgot oh triable."}
{"text":"There was nothing overtly above-average about this restaurant that would warrant a solid thumbs up. We walked in with no reservation, and when we were seated prior to our estimated wait time we were pleased. That came to an end by the time we were seated. We waited around 10 minutes to be introduced to our waitress and get our orders in. There was an average of 20 minute increments between getting our drinks (besides water) food, any refills and the check. This was a Thursday evening towards the end of the night, no reason at all for service to take that long.
As far as the food goes, it was okay. The spinach dip appetizer was hot and full of flavor, definitely a large enough portion to share with 3-4 people. I had the Campanelle Carbonara which had an overwhelming flavor of bacon. It literally took over the entire dish. My boyfriend had the Chicken Limone which was a nice well-rounded entree between the meat and veggies. Dessert was a Torta Di Cioccolata and was the best part of the entire meal- melted chocolate inside the cake complements very nicely with the scoop of vanilla gelato.
Maybe we'll come back for Happy Hour next time, I've heard good things. Hopefully we score with better service than this evening."}
{"text":"When ever we come in, it's always beyond busy so rather than wait an hour for a table, we usually request to sit at the bar bc there's hardly ever a wait, service is quick and they have tvs for those days when we wanna watch a game.

Carpaccio is my FAV here, I crave for the damn thing. Unfortunately I get too full off of that and the dinner bread that I don't really get the chance to try anything else. DISCLAIMER: I don't eat very much so appetizers usually do me fine as an entry-- don't judge me.

The ONLY complaint that I have about our visits to this restaurant is that the parking SUCKS. We end up putting the car in Valet than bother with parking."}
{"text":"Ambiance was good, service was good but the food was forgettable. Nice outdoor seating for the fall or spring season, view of the passing traffic, foot and vehicle. Their dessert was their savior and only reason why I am giving them 3-Stars. 

They had shot glasses filled with different desserts: Vanilla Creme Brulee, Milk Chocolate Caramel Cake, Tiramisu and Strawberry Cheesecake. We, husband and I, shared them. I like little samplings like this in places that you're unfamiliar with their food, it allows you to taste some of their desserts without having to order a large portion of something that you may not like. 

Brio isn't a place that I'll be visiting again, at least any time soon. I wasn't wow'd by anything that they had. The dessert was good but not outstanding."}
{"text":"I'm writing a review solely to the HH. 
I was able to try a few items when a friend hosted a BBQ and had the food catered. I was really surprised at how good down of the dishes were, and went to the restaurant the next day. 

Their happy hour deal is AMAAAAAAZING, since you can try their signature dishes for a potion of the price. Too bad it's only on weekdays, but it is definitely worth checking out.

I was not fond of the alcoholic beverages whatsoever...the mojito didn't taste like a mojito. They hadn't crushed the mint leaves so the flavor was one noted. We had to ask for mint too, since there were two leaves in there. 

The Manhattan was just terrible. 

Let me move onto the food though...
Flat bread pizza - 5/5 stars
Shrimp and zuchinni - 5/5 stars 
Beef carpaccio- 5/5 stars 

Everything else was 3-4 stars delicious!"}
{"text":"3 Stars - Food. The bruschetta was good but not outstanding.  Insalata caprese was very good with nice mozarella.  The pasta vodka was overspiced, overcooked, and unimpressive.
2 Stars - Atmosphere. Much of the silverware was dirty and had to be sent back before we even started. The restaurant itself was very loud and felt more like a shopping mall than a restaurant. 
1.5 Stars - Staff.  Bored, unattentive, and seemed bothered when we ordered. 
1 Star - Price.  Go elsewhere to get intimate or authentic.  Come here if you want to show off poor spending choices for a friend or relative you don't particularly like."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here today on a whim. Hungry for any lunch and driving down Scottsdale Rd. we found this place by accident. Never heard of it before and if the menu wasn't appealing, we were going to go to Sol for Mexican food. The menu had Lobster Bisque and we were sold. 

The inside is vast and very open, with high ceilings, enormous \"chandeliers\", and draperies. Everything is burnt yellow and pale orange colors with simple artwork decorating the walls. It was nice, but not my favorite. Looking around, I think we were the only diners under 30 - except for the one baby. Everyone else was either in their 40s or much older. This didn't look like our typical lunch crowd, but we didn't feel out of place.

I ordered the crab and shrimp cakes with roasted vegetables and hubby ordered the soup and salad - lobster bisque and Caesar. A bread basket came out, with half a mini loaf of sourdough and 3 pizza slice sized crackers with miscellaneous spices on top. Sourdough was good - hot and fresh. Hubby liked the crackers, but I didn't try - too messy.

The food came quickly afterwards. Mine was really good - especially the crab cakes. Only two cakes came on the plate on top of sauce, but there was a heaping vegetable portion. The cakes were soft and moist - the crab and shrimp very apparent throughout and delicious. Hubby's bisque was good, with visable chunks of lobster. Certainly not his favorite, but he said he would eat again. 

Overall, the food was good, but it wasn't spectacular. Also, later we found out Brio is a chain restaurant and for the most part, we try to avoid those and eat locally. If in the area again and have a craving for lobster bisque, we'd eat there, but probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Surprisingly uncrowded for Sunday afternoon.  Big portions, lunch prices for the win!  I wouldn't go for dinner because its overpriced IMO, but avoiding the crowds by going at off times and hitting it up for $14 lunch size pasta is a fair price in a non-chaotic environment."}
{"text":"My wife and I came for a quick lunch during one of our visits to LV.  Knowing that we were in a little rush, they brought our food quickly with a smile. The service was courteous and speedy. Try the creme brûlée!"}
{"text":"Nice discovery ! Kitchen and service was professional and clean. Just no time to finish our dishes that the server has removed our plates...
Good place to eat quietly outside !"}
{"text":"This review is only for their happy hour. I came here a while back for their dinner menu, but I don't remember my experience then. That'll be a future review.

Their happy hour is legit. I would say better than Yardhouse happy hour, but then again I'm not a big fan of Yardhouse. Their food menu is great. Multiple options for only $3.95 each!!! And drink specials are only $5!! And they aren't little skimpy appetizers either. Order about 2 or 3 items along with drinks, you'll definitely get full (well at least I did.) 

We ordered the spinach artichoke dip, shrimp piccante, margherita flatbread, brio burger and 4 cocktails. All came out to $35!!! Not bad for an afternoon of food and drink. Their peach sangria was definitely tastey and I was already on my second one even before the food came. All the items we ordered were delish. Good portions with a lot of flavor on each. Easy to share and reasonable on the price. The bar was busy so the bartenders weren't really on the chatty side. In conclusion, I would say this was a successful happy hour!!!"}
{"text":"There is a thin line between taste and haste I rarely get to Summerlin met a friend at Brio we ordered the chicken limone Got Served the pesce Piccata decided to just roll with it... the presentation was delightful the dish was so uninspired even after asking for crushed Chili Peppers short of dumping Himalayan salt fresh ground pepper maybe a bit of garlic or something on it I just found it the most bland dish I have had in ages"}
{"text":"Honestly,the best place I've eaten at! 
Definitely the best Italian place we've ever eaten! 
So so SO good!! Our server was amazing as well! Just great time overall. Can't rave enough!"}
{"text":"Came her on a family dinning trip and food was very good, my wife loves the lasagna here. Service was good. We will definitely return"}
{"text":"All their food are super delicious, love the ambiance, and their waiters are friendly and will be there whenever you need them."}
{"text":"Brio is one of my favorite places in Town Square. The decor is beautiful and they have great food. I have been here several times and the service is usually great. I feel like it is better when you sit at table rather than the bar. I prefer to come here during happy hour (3:30 to 6:30 pm) because the prices are more reasonable. They also have a late happy hour which I believe starts at 9 or 9:30pm. They have the most delicious shrimp and eggplant dish that is available for happy hour.  It is called the SPICY SHRIMP & EGGPLANT Pan seared shrimp, Romano crusted eggplant, black pepper cream sauce for $12.75 regular and half off for happy hour. I also love their Imported Bottled Peach Tea peach tea. SAN BENEDETTO for $3.25 each. They also have a nice kids menu with activities and crayons to keep them busy when I bring my 8 and 5 year old. They loved the food and feel like we are going to a fancy place because everything is so clean and nice. Town square has a lot to offer so if you drink here you can head to Blue Martini afterwards to dance."}
{"text":"Great lunch at brio! Get the quino and chicken salad and skip the fruti de Mara. Really nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Located in town square. 
Wonderful ambiance and awesome happy hour. 
Great place to grab a bite to eat after doing some retail therapy. 

Outdoor patio. 
Full bar. 

Brio is somewhere in between Olive Garden and an authentic Italian restaurant. Not horrible, but not quite THERE on the amazing Italian restaurant list. 

All the waiters are incredibly friendly. If you aren't in the mood for pasta they have healthy salads and meat dishes available as well. 

Come here after shopping in town square, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here with my family for dinner on a Saturday and I would definitely recommend making a reservation, as it is extremely busy on the weekends. There's an open bar with first come first serve seating. It took us about 10 minutes before getting seated with a reservation, and the service was friendly and our food came out fast.

For an appetizer, we ordered the Bruschetta Quattro. It was a little overpriced and overall just okay. For entrees, all the plates were huge and sharing is probably best. I ordered the Chicken Milanese and thought the crust of the chicken was very crunchy and made the overall plate delicious. Other entrees ordered were the Bistecca Alla Fiorentina and Gorgonzola Crusted Lamb Chops. The steak was cooked medium rare (medium is probably good if you only want a little pink) and very flavorful. The lamb plate came with 6 chops and the gorgonzola flavor was a little overpowering, but the lamb was tender and still good. Both plates came with creamy garlic mashed potatoes and some steamed vegetables. For dessert, we got the tiramisu. The whipped cream on top was carbonated which was an interesting surprise, but not necessary. The cake itself was very delicious though. I would come back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Consistently good.  Good service.  Good location.  They messed up my order, but made it right and took care of us.  We left happy.  Even if something goes wrong they make it right.  The food was great.  We will be back again sometime."}
{"text":"I wish they had an option for less than one star-- my mom and I came in for happy hour and found a high top- sat and waited for over 15 minutes without anyone even greeting us. We walked out and they lost a customer out of both of us."}
{"text":"The best happy hour menu! Their beef carpaccio and brio burger are my two favorites! The only thing is that their happy hour is only at the bar and its first come first serve. It gets filled up pretty fast so you have to get there early."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Horrible. 
I spoke to the manager about it at the time and he was unwilling to do anything for us, explaining that \"the person was new and it was a busy day.\"

then I yelped it, and the manager or owner (like on several reviews here) wrote to me assuring they'll make things \"right\" if I'll remove my Yelp review. 

I did so. That was four months ago. We tried again, but were treated about the same.

I wish I hadn't taken down my original posting, but I do have the letter here on Yelp, that was written by Brio, saying if I'd take it down, they'd make things right. :(

Never again"}
{"text":"I can't even describe how much I love this place, service and everyone who works here period. Been coming here every Wednesday for past 2 years. It's literally my second home."}
{"text":"Okay, it's a chain. Finding a restaurant that's not a chain in Phoenix is a challenge, to say the least....for the most part it comes down to finding one that's part of a smaller chain (rather than, for example, an Olive Garden or Red Lobster), and that's what Brio is. 

That said, the food is quite good. We got invited to a free lunch here just before they officially opened, and it was good enough that we returned as paying customers. The dishes are reasonably authentic compared to what you'd get in Tuscany region, and the service is superlative. Great appetizers, great desserts....in short, one of the few places in the area that's not a carbon copy of everything else. Pricey but not unreasonable, and certainly worth it."}
{"text":"The best adka vodka pasta I have had in a long time!! To die for. Service was great and love dinning there every time! I haven't had a bad meal yet!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise that I received a phone call from the general manager and when I  return from vacation I'm taking him up on his. offer for a complementary lunch/dinner. The general manager was warm and friendly on the phone and I look forward to meeting him!"}
{"text":"Came here for an early dinner with a friend I ordered the steak salad, The cauliflower, and the brussels sprouts. The salad was very good however I did not like the Gorgonzola it was a little overpowering. I was told that the sangria, white sangria,was very very good but did not try it. I saw a few state dishes and even a lobster dish that looked delicious so I will be back to try Brio for dinner. The ambience is very pleasant especially with the outdoor seating just be prepared to have sunglasses if you decide to come on a sunny day."}
{"text":"Met my POPs for dinner here while in town for the evening. Started at the Bar with a lovely Mendocino Petite Syrah.. moved to a table where our crew joined us after shopping all that Tivoli Had to offer . What a nice experience. We each ordered something different and all were delicious . Therefore, it's a safe bet that since we had 5 completely happy satisfied bellie's.. whatever you order will be perfect. The staff is absolutely wonderful. Everyone smiles and greets you no matter where you are in the restaurant. 
Since this is a regular place for my POPs.. I will make it my destination dinner each time I come to town. 
Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places! I've been coming here since I moved to Gilbert 3 years ago. The service is always great and TJ is the best bartender ever! Always entertaining!"}
{"text":"-happy hour regular; so posting just for HH, not restaurant. 
-can get very crowded to no seats in happy hour area, and people don't move that quickly to vacate.
- bar service can get slow, two bartenders for HH rush hour?  not enough. 
- HH food is a good deal.  pepper shrimp!  
- sometimes the food can come out cold, my flatbread pizza is hit and miss"}
{"text":"Came here for my cousins rehersal dinner and the first dish out was the lobster bisque and it was one of the best things ive ever ate !!!!!! AMAZING, I could have ate 10 more bowls of this and forget the main dish.
the main dish i got some chicken dish that i dont remember that well. I do remember that it was over pasta and the pasta was great, 
I also had 2 GREAT dirty martinis ,"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there on a week night the food was ok but the service was slow.
My wife had there signature salmon dish which was good and I had there signature Shrimp dish, shrimp was excellent but was buried with rice and vegetables.
The employee at the Apple Store across the street had more personality then our waitress. Asked for a second glass of wine when my dinner was serviced and when I was done eating they serviced to me told them no thanks them the waitress came back and said it was on the house again told her no thanks I just wanted it with my meal, oh well.
They told us they have a location in our home state but don't think we will be visiting that location.
Need to do something about the wait staff big time."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice so far during their happy hour special. We have enjoyed every bite! We tried every appetizer on their happy hour menu and especially enjoyed their burgers and shrimp cocktail."}
{"text":"Omgeeee so good. It was my first time me and my kids enjoyed our food and experience. Service was good. They did forget to bring us a high chair but it was no big deal, so we didn't bother to bring it up to our server. Over all it was great we will be back"}
{"text":"Wow. I had the Lasagna this time, and let me just say one thing about it: Amazing. What's funny is the kids spagetti was good too lol - I think next time I will get it ... It was good AND big enough of a serving after eating all the bread and stuff.  I love Brio and can't wait to keep going back and trying more on the menu."}
{"text":"Cheesecake Factory is way better. This place has very slow service and the hostesses seemed stuck up. The food wasn't all that great either, but the appetizers are pretty tasty. I think this place is way overrated."}
{"text":"Great food and beautiful location. Perfect place to chill with a drink and an app. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Brio had great atmosphere and food!

Cocktails: cucumber Basil gimlet, was so super tastey.  It was like freshest, coolest lemonade I've ever had. My favorite item by far and it was only $7.50!
I also had a glass of Sketchbook pinot noir and it was nice with dinner and reasonably priced at $9.00 a glass.

Food: The caprese salad was good quality ingredients and reasonably portioned. My only complaint is it def needed more balsamic. Their balsamic is a good one by the way.
We also had the lasagna bolognese. This item was really tastey. Nothing crazy extravagant and certainly nothing to complain about. It was just a great item 
The prices were pretty good in my opinion. 10-20 a person without drinks.
When we got there we were seated on the patio. The weather was fantastic so that only added to the awesome atmosphere. 

My only complaint for the evening was our waitress. She was a total bug a boo. I felt rushed and like she wanted us out of there. 
However, the staff was amazing other than her and I can tell she was the only annoying staff member."}
{"text":"This review is on their happy hour. They have really good food and drinks for cheap! The ambiance is also nice. The outdoor seating is cute and a great place to hang out. It gets pretty crowded for HH though so you might need a little luck to find a good spot."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we were celebrating a very special occasion. So we were hoping for the best...and that is what we got! The service that we recieved that night was awesome and the food was delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"5 stars all the wayyyyyyy!  Cinnamon was a great server!  She made our time there the best!  She was so attentive and pleasant!  Next time we are there, we will definitely ask for her.  I asked her to bring a small dessert to my friend who was celebrating her birthday.  She made our time there so fantastic!  Food was awesome...  So glad that we chose Brio's."}
{"text":"I love the food here, but the service is never good. We come  at least once a month, have different servers and it's still the same story every time. The water never gets refilled, we have to wait way too long to order and way too long to get our check."}
{"text":"The Parmesan crusted chicken salad is to die for. My husband just had the Smore's dessert and it was amazing! You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Brio Tuscan Grille is a chain of formula restaurants serving Northern Italian  inspired food, much like Maggianno's Little Italy  is a chain that serves more Southern Italian inspired food.

It has about 30 locations and is HQ in Ohio. There is another one in Gilbert, AZ.

The decor is sumptious and large, with high ceilings, dark woods, draped white cotton materials in archways and to the center of the dining room, with Tuscan marble color inspired motif in beiges and terra cota, and faux terra cota wall textures in golden orange hues.. 

The bar is a classic marble top with dark wood storage canopy overhead, and several booths where there is no wait. The dining room is very large, almost ballroom size. There is also a large patio for snowbirds to enjoy the Scottsdale winter weather. 

I-Pop plays incessently on the speakers. (I-Pop is Italian top 40s music, not the latest music player from Apple!)

The food is Tuscan inspired but has an American slant to many dishes and ingredients. And like Maggiano's, the dishes are HUGE!

I sat at the bar for lunch and ordered from the Primi portion of the menu (meaning first, or appetizers) a Beef Carpaccio ($9.95) and Spicy Pepper Shrimp on Grilled Eggplant ($9.95).  

They were served in long narrow oval dishes. The Carpaccio was in a plate about 18 inches long! Nice raw beef, covered with olive oil, capers, and a streak of Aioli. In the center was a stack of arugula in a nice, sweet, but light dressing, and served with 2 triangles of brittle cheese infused bread crackers.

The Shrimp came in a rich cream sauce, with each shrimp laying atop a breaded and grilled Melanzone, or eggplant wedge, with a healthy dose of black pepper throughout to spice it up. The flavors were great, but a little overdone in richness and peppers, and too oily in the eggplant. 

They serve fresh warm bread and herb seasoned cracker wedges with butter, complimentary. Iced tea was $2.50.

Service was very friendly, and professional. All staff wear white shirts and Ties, like you would find in most restaurants in Firenze, Italia..

This is a great place to bring family and friends in the beautiful new Scottsdale Quarter mall, which is still under construction and right across from the higher end Kierland Commons on North Scottsdale Road."}
{"text":"Duh Solid!  I love their ambiance and their food is very tasty.  I've heard complaints that it is a chain resto but seriously doesn't feel like there is any lack of service.  The waiters are usually very well mannered and competent.  One quick tip is to check out their Happy hour (even on friday nights!) totally worth it and the prices on the food is RIDICulous for the quality you get!"}
{"text":"Always consistently pretty darn good! the menu is huge! prices are a little more then olive grade, place is ginormous with an amazing patio and bar!"}
{"text":"I've been to Brio a few times.  This was my first visit to this location.  I had a chicken and Quinoa salad off their low calorie menu.  Very good.  Also had the tomato bisque  which was excellent!!!  Service was good.  Everything about lunch was good. Good spot for a business lunch.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We went for the amazing happy hour deals, but the bar was too full for us to find a table for our girls night out.  We sat on the patio instead and had the greatest server ever, Brandon.  

The strawberry basil lemonade was incredible and the food was so tummy.  But the true highpoint of the night was Brandon.  He was kind, funny, knowledgeable and clever.  

If you have Brandon as your server be kind, he deserves it."}
{"text":"Great food with a lovely view of shopping area on outside table service. Only problem I had was keeping my napkin on my lap due to the wind! Brunch is served til 3 pm. If you're in Vegas check out this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now for dinner about 6 months apart and my experiences have been similar (not bad, not outstanding, and I would go here again but it is not at the top of my list). The place is expansive, loud, and has an upscale chain-like feel to it and it is very busy around the Happy and Dinner hours. My group scored some seats in the bar on my last visit while waiting for our table and I will give them good marks for some straight forward and affordable adult beverages. 

The luster decreases a bit in the dining room. The decor is upscale in appearance but the service and volume detracted from that. Servers were not always around when you were looking for them and the noise level was so high that our table of 4 could barely hear each other and had to keep leaning in throughout the evening to ask the person speaking to repeat themselves. It was my impression that the servers were short-staffed (I literally saw 2 of them at close to full sprints on a few occasions trying to get back to the kitchen to pick up ready meals at the pass) while our table sat unattended to. The noise level was accentuated by the lead chef who was expediting by occasionally yelling (literally screaming) at the kitchen crew. It was entertaining at first as I like to watch chaotic kitchens get their rhythm but this did not occur throughout our meal and the outbursts became a little distracting after a while. 

The menu is a bit unfocused in my opinion and seems like it tries to offer something for everyone as American chain restaurants like to do. Portion size is good and the food was tasty but not over the top great. One gripe is that their $6 side of Brussels sprouts was pretty measly and it took about 45 min for food to hit our table. That sort of confirmed for me that the kitchen did not have its act together on my last visit.  

In the end, I think an \"A-OK\" rating of 3 stars is right on. I've had better and worse meals in my life and I like enough aspects of Brio to go back but it is not the place that I think of first when searching out dinner in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Food great but the best happy hour in Vegas!!! Price is really low & great sizes to share. & the drinks are like the price of a soda"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and the past THREE times I've come here something always goes wrong mostly the food isn't right and it goes back to the kitchen then I have to wait and eat my food and it's cold. It's get tiring ridiculous it makes me not want to come back to this restaurant because they can't handle someone's order...."}
{"text":"I wanted to LOVE this place since we were planning to reserve a room for our daughters birthday but we've had a change of heart. While our server was a bit slow, which was understandable since it was a busy night. But my husband's order(short rib) was frozen! Seriously frozen inside. How does a restaurant charge $20 something for a frozen meal?! This place is nothing but an overpriced Olive Garden. Without the awesome soup and bread!"}
{"text":"Located in Town Square on Las Vegas Blvd. Let me get this out of the way, I am not a big fan of pasta (It's boiled dough for cryin' out loud) and ordering chicken at a restaurant (unless it comes in a bucket), that being said they many other options, and just salmon, actual beef! This is a great date place, only because women really like it, as a matte fact I may be the first male to review this place. And the only reason I have ever been here is because of a date many months ago. (the date turned out badly, the meal however was quite good). So fellas take your lady here, you will both be happy. Oh I almost forgot download their app for groovy deals and offers. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Brio when I wanna be casual classy. Ya know, classier than Yard House, but not paying Fleming's classy prices. 

One of my favorite date night restaurants. Great decor inside, good food and good selection of wines. Awesome service. 

My 4 stars is mostly for the ambiance and not so much the food. The mushroom ravioli is pretty good, but when I went this past weekend, it was so-so. I'm hoping the next time it'd be as great as when I tried it the first time. Orrrr I should probably order something else. 

Who doesn't love free bread? I usually wait a while to eat mine so I can use it to soak up the sauce from my pasta. 

Overall it's a decent experience here as long as you don't set the bar too high. But it's great for any occasion: catching up with friends, date night, family dinner and I even came here for my birthday once. 

Good place to check out while you're at Town Square Mall."}
{"text":"I love this place, my food has always been wonderful. Hats off to the chefs. Unfortunately like I have seen in previous reviews the bar is definitely not the place to sit. Being in the industry for more than 15 years and a bartender I generally sit at the bar and can be critical I am sure. The problem is a server had to actually help me. When the bartender came finally I was never greeted. She never checked to see how my food was until nearly done. I sat without a drink for awhile. I am usually forgiving but I am one of two people here and the fact that most of the time she just kept gossiping with a fellow worker. I know all the juicy news. I know this happens but it shouldn't to the detriment of your two customers. I still recommend the place maybe just not the bar area! Shame!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in Tivoli Village, an upscale mixed-use retail and office development. The restaurant offers classic Italian fares, such as Bruschetta, pasta pesto, pasta carbonara, etc., in addition to a nice selection of appetizers, fish, chicken and steak dishes. I tried the pasta carbonara; one of the best I've had this side of the Atlantic. The serving was generous enough that I had no room left for dessert, so I am determined to go back for more..."}
{"text":"One of the many restaurants located in Scottsdale quarters. Mix of American and Italian food. We went for lunch. The pasta entrees were great. One of the salads came without the dressing but that was taken care of immediately. Checking into yelp does get you a free appetizer. Service is friendly as well 
This place has an excellent happy hour with several great food items."}
{"text":"Celebrated our 35th wedding anniversary at this restaurant. The place reminded me of Cheesecake Factory, but on a higher level. The dining area is adjacent to the bar so you can see the three TV's. It's not a very romantic restaurant, used Open Table to make reservation and added a note about our celebration.
When we arrived, we had to wait about 10-15 minutes because they were backlogged. When we were seated, the table had two red napkins shaped as a rose. The manager came by and gave each of us a complimentary glass of champagne.
When I logged into Yelp, there was a coupon for a free appetizer which we used for the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant. It was delicious and not that spicy. 
I ordered the Shrimp and Lobster Fettuccine and my wife had the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake dinner. The fettuccine was cooked al dente, excellent and the sauce was superb. My wife's crab cake was awesome with the tasty fingerling potatoes.
To top the dinner off, they offered us a free dessert to choose from three. We selected the Brio's Famous Cheesecake. That hit the spot. I ordered coffee which came half full.
The server needs to pay attention and ask additional questions: Do you take cream with your coffee, (so I can get a full cup) and when I ask for a knife, don't wait 20 minutes and get remind. 
With our check, we received a note from the manager congratulating us and offered us a free appetizer on our next visit.
Now this restaurant knows how to entice their patrons...customer service is what it's all about."}
{"text":"Weather was perfect for outdoor dining. Had the shrimp & lobster ravioli with a Caesar salad. Salad was perfect. Ravioli was delicious; tender shrimp with lobster ravioli and a sauce with a little heat. Service was quick! Great dining experience!"}
{"text":"We went to Brio for our 4 year anniversary and were very disappointed. It was our first time ever at Brio and we've heard good things so we thought we'd try it. Our server was great, but the food not so much. We don't mind spending extra money on good food but we ended up spending extra money on mediocre, bland food. My boy friend got raviolis which were 16 dollars and came with 5 bite sized raviolis. My pasta was bland and I ended up adding extra pepper to it just so it could have some flavor. We ended up spending over $100 on bad food.  Needless to say, we won't be going to brio ever again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for happy hour and am never disappointed. The appetizers are amazing and the drink specials are very well priced. I recommend the spicy shrimp!"}
{"text":"The food is great but the hosts are nasty. At the Brio's entrance two young guys (host) giving arrogant look and waited until we ask them for the table. Excuse me, not me, they have to be hospitable to ask if we want to have a table. Anywhere in Italian restaurant hostess speak first not the guests."}
{"text":"Great Italian resturaunt off the strip.  Didn't go during Happy Hour but everyone says it's a bargain.  Food quality excellent and nice decor.  Had the lasanga and it was awesome."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my boss at this place last week. Very nice on the inside, surprised to find out this place was a chain.

Had the tomato bisque and split the bruschetta sampler. Both plates were excellent. Everything was freshly made (our waiter reiterated this fact several times). My favorite bruschetta had the caramelized onions on it. Also, I loved the mini deserts. Great way to have something sweet without paying/eating too much. I ordered the Bread Pudding and it was AMAZING. I"}
{"text":"The food was great however, the service was horrible. I am a server at a fine dining restaurant myself and I must say.. the service here was below average. Rachel was our server.. She had no personality nor did she try to up sell a single item on the menu. I like to offer my guests a glass of wine or a beverage to start. It seems like she just wanted us out of there because we had 2 young teens with us. I felt like we were rushed and not given the proper service we deserved. I made a reservation through open table and noted a birthday.. She could've at least greeted us with a happy birthday? Instead when dessert time came around she just left the dessert menu on the table without even explaining to us what was on it. I'll be back for the food.. But definitely get out of Rachel's section! I have better customer service at McDonald's. At least the workers there smile and are polite. I'm now on my way to have drinks elsewhere"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, but most recently I ate here for a work dinner. Each time I eat here I am reminded that I shouldn't judge chains so harshly. This one is doing it right with food and service.

Our service was very good, especially for a large group. Our drink orders were taken immediately and brought out quickly. They also did a good job of keeping up with fresh drinks for the heavy drinkers. Our starters came out quickly and meals followed shortly after. Every need was addressed right away by our waitress. 

I started with Lobster Bisque and the Chopped Salad. The Lobster Bisque is well flavored and the serving is perfect for a rich bisque. The Chopped Salad has a nice variety of vegetables and black olives with a tangy vinaigrette. I liked that it's chopped for easy eating. 

For my main entrée I ordered the Pasta Fra Diavolo with Shrimp. There was plenty of large shrimp in the dish and the sauce packed the heat I was looking for in the dish. The portion was plenty. Paired with starters I was only able to eat half and enjoyed the other half for lunch the next day. 

All of the dishes ordered at the table looked delicious. The next day everyone discussed how happy they were with their entrees and that we were pleasantly surprised by our Brio experience."}
{"text":"Let me just say do not order Chicken Under the Brick. Without the marsala on it (I ordered sans due to a dietary restriction), you can easily tell it is a very cheap, flat cut of chicken. Not whatsoever worth the price. It looks okay in the pictures I've seen on here but again, without the sauce it's pretty pathetic. 

That being said, it was quickly replaced with a house salad that was excellent, my grandmother ordered the steak salad which looked fantastic too. I took a couple bites of the steak which was a well-prepared, good cut of steak.

Our server was really great too!!! The bartender was also accommodating even though we had a server. Excellent service here all around. 

They have a *very* small craft beer selection but had what all I needed. 

Despite the chicken mishap, I'll definitely be back. They probably would have been a 3 star, but their excellent server saved them. I'm docking one star for the chicken, but if I had an entree comparable to the steak salad in taste/quality I wouldn't have a problem updating with a 5."}
{"text":"This place is pretty dang awesome for a chain!

We went here for an early birthday dinner celebration in the later evening. They were pretty packed, but service was still good. It's very pretty and romantic inside, so it's a nice place for a date or a bachelorette party. 

We ordered the chicken milanese and the sausage pomodoro. Both dishes came out fairly quickly, and tasted wonderful! It's probably hard to go wrong with any of the dishes though.. everything smells really good! I also opted for the peach bellini, which was fruity, sweet, and totally did not have a hint of alcohol! 

They also have a pretty good menu for happy hour on weekdays! :)"}
{"text":"Love Love Love Brio.  The food here is delicious and original, not to mention they have a fantastic Sunday Brunch menu that can help kill even the worst of hangovers.

Service is prompt and the prices are all extremely reasonable, and there's always a ton of seating and I've never had to wait for a table.

Huge portions that I always have a hard time finishing, though I always try really hard!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch the other day.   Nice place. Service was very good.  The food tasted great.  But i guess the lunch menu the portions are smaller.  For the price. Its not worth eating there at lunch.  I ate all my food and walked out hungry.  As good as food was  i cant see going back for those prices. Our bill was 50 dollars for 2 lunch meals and 2 iced teas."}
{"text":"They have the best frozen peach Bellini drinks for brunch. The stuffed French toast is also delicious!"}
{"text":"This has been the BEST restaurant we've ever been to in Vegas and I've lived here my entire life!!! We had the sweetest waitress named Mary and the General Manager made our visit incredibly inviting. The food was insanely good! Not one thing was off on our visit. Our kids had a variety of dishes and raved about it the entire night. They loved the pizza dough they sent out for them to play with. I ordered their wedge salad and everyone wanted to have some. It was the BEST salad I've ever had!!! Seriously, if you haven't tried this restaurant then you're REALLY missing out!!! We live 55 minutes from this location, but will make the trip just to enjoy quality food with our friends and family. 5 stars really doesn't do it justice. Keep up the GREAT work Brio Tuscan Grille and staff!!!"}
{"text":"I give the food a 3, and the service a 1. We went for happy hour and our service was a joke. Empty plates sat on our table, it took forever to get our drinks, our food was cold, but was otherwise pretty good. It took so long to get my husband's glass of wine that our friend had to walk to the bar to get it. My Italian margarita had so much sour in it I couldn't drink it, the mango mojito tasted like club soda. After dinner my friend called and told the manager about the service and her response was, \"I'll talk to the food server.\" I won't go back."}
{"text":"Food is good, Service though definitely needs improvement!!  This was my second time here, and unfortunately I'd have a tough time coming back.  Even for happy hour.  (which is a pretty good happy hour).  Our server, (Alecia G.) might have just been having an off day, but as mentioned above my previous visit, was a male server, who had no clue how to describe the food, or to suggestive sell on martini's and or cocktails.  This visit though was on a slower night, and I expected better service, than just having to ask for water refill (it is hot in AZ... you'd think water would be almost a given each time I got a cocktail).  We had to ask for the 4th place setting when our food came, and by the time we got that, the flatbread pizza was cold, and pasta the same.  At least there are other restaurant options in the direct area, (SOL, Eddie V's, etc)"}
{"text":"One of our go to restaurants. The food and service is always great and occasionally you will run in to a celebrity. I met Kim Coates (Tim from Sons of Anarchy) there and he was super cool. 
The food is always good. I love their carbonara sauce. 
Great wines by the glass and bottle and an awesome selection of apps."}
{"text":"I came here for HH to see what the hype was all about, and it surely does live up to it!

Drinks are $5 and appetizers are $3.95.  We started with their white peach sangria and beef carpaccio, spicy shrimp & eggplant, and four cheese pizzeta.  We thought that the food wouldn't be enough, but boy were we wrong!  The portions are HUGE for the price.  One appetizer for each of us would have been enough.  The flat bread pizza was good and paired well with our sangrias.  But our favorite dishes are the spicy shrimp & eggplant and beef carpaccio.  The spicy shrimp was laid on top of the eggplant with this creamy sauce ladled around it.  The beef carpaccio is definitely a star all on its own.  Its such a steal to get a huge plate full of thinly sliced beef for less than 4 bucks.  I've carpaccio at sushi restaurants, but this was way different.  The beef melted in your mouth and I could've probably scarfed down the whole plate if I wasn't sharing it.  

My first time there did not disappoint.  I'll definitely be back for a beef carpaccio of my own and try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Maybe we just got a bad night ,but the food was not that good very salty. I gave a 2 star for the service the waiter was outstanding. The prices were very high for what you got. Definitely better Italian food restaurants in Summerlin."}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas from Seattle.  We met up with some \"local\" friends who took us out to Brio.  The patio was packed and the inside was pretty busy too.  We had to wait four approximately 30 minutes for a table (Saturday night and lots of prom goers to contend with).  Once we were seated our waiter came right over and took our drink order.   We also received a bread basket that included herbed, baked cheese crackers which were an excellent alternative to bread.  I ordered the steak salad - PHENOMENAL! The flavors were amazing, lettuce, arugala, steak, feta cheese, balamic drizzle and a delicious dressing.  I will go back next time we are in Vegas.  I would never have known about this place if not for our friends that live there.  We wish there was one in Seattle!!!"}
{"text":"Day 2 and they're off to a good start!

--warm, firm-crust sourdough bread, my favorite;
--gorgonzola-topped lamb chops didn't work for me. they just don't go together.
--crusted lavosh tries too hard, too much rosemary;
--crab cakes moist and nice texture, needs more crisp;
--warm garnish (lettuce, spinach) salads perfectly cooked!!
--lobster bisque has cheese! ew;
--shrimp diavolo, needed chives not green onions, penne not right choice for pasta, wanted tomatoes, not just sauce;
--no steaks for lunch, except steak salad. very north-scottsdale

--ratio of staff to guest is at least 4 to 1, and the place was pretty full (lots of manager types watching your every move); they've spent a lot of time prepping for service details and it shows ... and on the 2nd day!
--exciting restaurant opening, you can feel the energy;
--chandeliers and wall treatments and \"curly fantasy\" remind me too much of  Cheesecake Factory (just across the street)
--chef stands at the pass in front of the kitchen, Hell's Kitchen-style. he even has the pencil perched on his ear, and he yells out the orders to the kitchen. all that's missing is the \"YES! CHEF!!\"

can't wait to go back next week for a steak dinner."}
{"text":"I really dislike this place and I'm always surprised to hear I'm in the minority here. It's got a very grand setup with nice looking menu offerings. But I've had so many bland, boring meals with forgetful and unfriendly servers. I was polite and even agreed to come here recently for happy hour on the patio, only to find our favorite part of the late afternoon happy hour food and drink being the cover singer and guitarist who played for us. 

Brio is certainly better than Olive Garden, but it has that similar chain restaurant flavor. Underwhelming, especially for the price. 

I pray that my in-laws find a new favorite restaurant before our next family get together."}
{"text":"We had no prior knowledge about Brio, and decided to check it out because had a free appetizer coupon.  I'm curious if Brio is owned by or related to The Cheesecake Factory because the interior and ambiance is very similar.  We didn't have to wait very long to be seated.  We were seated outside, where there are heat lamps (cold this time of year in Arizona). We chose the bruschetta sampler for our appetizer - each 
and every one was delicious. Brio is a bit pricier than say, Olive Garden, the appetizer itself was $15, but relatively reasonable considering the food quality, service, and restaurant ambiance.  We both chose pasta dishes. The serving sizes are hearty, and food was good.  Have never been for happy hour, but sounds worth checking out!!

Even though Brio has the cookie cutter chain restaurant feel, the service and food was good, and enjoyable will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 13 people. After we sat down, there was a 20 minute wait for our two waiters to just take our drink order. After we FINALLY got our drinks, they took our food order. Halfway through the order, a different server took over. Then, we waited an hour for our food. Two people in our party ordered the lasagna. As they were delivering the food, they informed us that they only had one serving so they split it in half and served it. We had two children under the age of 5 with us and we asked for dough for them to play with four times before they brought it over. Also, had to ask for drinks several times before they were brought to the table. The manager never came over and talked to us. From where we were sitting we could see that he was looking at us and talking about our table. When the brought the bill, there were still the 2 separate orders of lasagna on it, even though they took one full order and split it in half for two people. I was highly disappointed in the service. Not once did they apologize or ask if there was anything they could do. I will never return back to this restaurant or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I like to review my entire experience.  So this is what I have to say.

First the bad, or not so wonderful things: it is CROWDED.  Of course it's loud (would never come here for a romantic dinner) and the tables are spaced far enough apart, but the walkways are tiny.  All of them.  It made for a couple almost embarrassing 'run-ins' with servers.  It was very busy on a Monday night too, so there was a lot of hustle and bustle.
Second and this is more of a 'miff'.  I understand the bar menu is separate and that's fine.   What I don't like is when a restaurant does not carry over happy hour pricing into the dining area, at least just the drinks.  The bar area is very small.  So for those of us that have a family...most of us aren't going to pay $15-30 per entree and plop down $10-15 for a glass of wine.  I really wish you could at least offer the happy hour drinks throughout the restaurant. 
The decor is very much like a Cheesecake Factory.  It's pretty, I like it.
It's a little pricey for what you get.
The sourdough bread is good but about the furthest thing from Tuscan bread.  
Now for the good.  The food.  It was delicious.  Salty..but I love salt.  For those who don't it might be verging on the edge of too salty.  But my party enjoyed everything they ordered.  I would return.  I know it's a chain, but the quality is better than a lot of standard chain restaurants.  Our service was good as well."}
{"text":"WTH BRIO you broke my heart.

I have visited brio in town square numerous times. but the Brio on Rampart is so much closer to my home. I came to enjoy their wonderful happy hour and great sangria and was heartbroken by the WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

1) it took the waitress 35 minutes to take our order. fine fine i'll let that slide..
2) the waitress didn't bring us any bread. we thought it was because it was happy hour but all the surrounding tables had bread. 
3) we were sitting at a tiny cocktail table with 3 cups of water pitcher of sangria with 3 wine glass plus the salt/pepper sugar... summary. Not much room. when our food came he wouldn't take other dishes away. we asked him nicely to if he could take some dishes away and even passed it to him and he just walked away! HOW FREAKING RUDE. i thought he was going to put something down and come back because we CLEARLY had no room on our tiny little cocktail table to put 4 giant plates on the table and eat comfortably. but guess what. he left. like the jerk he is. 
4) when we needed the bill to get out of this place the waitress was no where to be found. this was suppose to be a quick drink eat and go that ended up taking over 2 hours because the waitress forgot we existed. 

the food was still consistent and delicious as expected. but nothing ruins an eating experience worse than bad customer service.

the worst part of this visit was not only was the waitress terrible and inattentive. the food server guy was also terrible. it wasn't just one person that ruined my night. it was TWO. TWO TERRIBLE WORKERS. i couldn't believe the lack of customer service we received at this place.

I'll never come back to this Brio again."}
{"text":"My Shrimp and Lobster fettuccine was delicious! I also ordered the Sangria which was amazing. Great service and a great atmosphere. It has about the same atmosphere as Cheesecake Factory, and it's in Tivoli Village. That means there's a lot to do after dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place. Me and my mom come here all the time for happy hour. We love it. It is hard to find seating for happy hours since it's only available by the bar and they do get busy but once you do so worth it. My mom usually gets the peach sangria it's her favorite. I get different things. But we always. Always get the spicy shrimp sauce and eggplant appetizer. It's to die for."}
{"text":"Brio is a pleasant surprise.

I thought it would be Olive Garden on steriods, but it wasn't.  Thank god we made reservations, though, we would be waiting forever.  This place was jam packed (on a Thursday, 7:00p).  Maybe because martinis were $5 a pop?  

Our server was friendly and informative.  I was scared my friend wouldn't enjoy the food because she is vegitarian.  My girlfriend and I ordered the roasted red pepper and mozzarella bruschetta (which was delicious!) and the mushroom ravioli (to die for).  We couldn't say no when he brought the dessert tray.  Bread pudding warm and glorious!

All in all, a success."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour, which was totally loud and busy!  We got the last bar table.  It took a little while but finally someone took our drink and food order.  They forgot one of the apps, so we had to ask the waitress.  We also had to ask her repeatedly for refills.  Other than the waitress and staff who need a  bit more training in customer service, we thought the food was very good (vegs and hummus, spinach/artichoke dip, shrimp, caprese salad).  There are pita chips with everything, I'd like to see them offer something that's gluten free.  Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome ! Everything about it from the moment we were sat down by our server to the moment we left.  Great decor, wine selections, appetizers, entrees and of course desserts. Our waiter Chuck did an amazing job making sure we had everything we needed. He was very attentive and informative.  Chuck made our visit all the more pleasant.  Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Brio is one of our loves and the place we like to go for birthday dinners, family get togethers. It's very pretty inside and the beautiful decor reflects the good food.
They have a full bar and happy hour and a wonderful outdoor seating area where you can people watch while enjoying your meal.
I have a great affinity for the flatbread that comes in their bread basket. Crispy triangles that are coated in herbs, sesame seeds, and cheese full of flavor and texture.
Our favorite is the Pasta alla Vodka. That is why we come to Brio.
My heart skips a little beat when they put this dish down in front of me and shower it in finely grated parmesan cheese. The aroma of the vodka sauce is one I have not experiened in any other Italian restaurant. Can't quite put my finger on what makes that distinctive delicious Brio Vodka sauce so special. Maybe it's the garlic that's been shaved thin (with razor blades?), or the fresh basil that perfumes the sauce, or it's the star of the dish...the soft pillows of heaven...the delicate ricotta filled pasta purses that melt in your mouth and go oh so very well with the sauce. I swear someone else must be eating my dish because it goes too quick until you devour the last of the pasta and reach for the sourdough bread to sop up the rest of this amazing sauce...it would be a sin not to!
This is all I want to write about Brio, because when you come there you must order the Pasta Alla Vodka :)"}
{"text":"Dog friendly patio. Wonderful atmosphere, pleasant staff that executes good service, quality food at reasonable prices. We love the carpaccio. Valet staff is super and remembers us from previous visits."}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing lunch I had the carbonada it was great... the most friendly bartender Rosel  and Jackie the manager was on top of everything we has a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a really good salad and this place totally satisfied my craving! great service, nice atmosphere, tasty food. Ill be back."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the service was POOR at best. Only 8 tables with customers at the time and they couldn't handle basic service. Our waiter poured our waters and asked what we wanted to eat. He took our order and disappeared. We flagged him down after 5 minutes or so and asked for some bread. He said it was still being made then disappears for another 10 minutes, shows up with our 2 entree salads and a chicken Marsala and said the bread is almost done.  2 minutes later he drops off the bread and disappears for the rest of our meal. He never asked for our drink order, didn't check on us during our meal, or even refilled our waters.I asked for the manager and explained what our experience was like so far. He apologized and said he would be right back to refill our waters, which he did. Even though we told the manager that our waiter never took our drink order, HE didn't even care to know what else we might want to drink besides water. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and figured Brio was out of sodas, teas, coffees, beers, wines, and liquor for the rest of the weekend. They offered us free dessert, but at that point we were just done.  Remember, this was when there were only 8 tables that were occupied. I can only imagine what the service would be like if the place were slammed, but then again maybe that's why the place was empty on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"After doing a little shopping, decided to stop in for a bite to eat!  Service was great, and the ambience was nice!  Wasn't too hungry so just had a salad and a cocktail.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed happy hour here. The Sangria was excellent and would highly recommend it. The pricing for the happy hour really makes it a worthwhile stop.  However, I did not like the spinach and artichoke dip.  The rest of the appetizers were decent.  Overall the restaurant is much better than the happy hour at the bar, but the price is right to hang out, have a Sangria, and a few appetizers."}
{"text":"Always great service, accommodating staff, service with a smile! I'm addicted to their steak salad. The Best!"}
{"text":"Excellent food & service ~ ordered the bisque (divine!) chicken Cesar salad & the brio pasta with caramel marscapone cheesecake for dessert YUM!! 
Loved everything"}
{"text":"Food was excellent as always but unfortunately the portion size has greatly gone down & incidentally making brio overpriced. It's too bad because I used to really dig this place but now I feel like I'm get'n rip'd off! Everything we ordered look'd like It was either off the kids menu or was the size of an appetizer. Don't get me wrong though, if money is no object, then party on Wayne! I personally can't enjoy anything that makes me feel like a glutton lol"}
{"text":"The Risotto duo was GREAT...one was lobster one was scallops....beautiful presentation and both were delicious"}
{"text":"You can really never go wrong with Brio. Hands down the best local Happy Hour IMO! 

Brio has Happy Hour Mon - Fri from 3:30P - 6:30P. HH is available at the bar/seating around the bar indoors or outside. Bartenders and servers are incredibly attentive on a consistent basis and the HH bites and drinks are so worth the visits to Brio.

Below are my go to recommendations:

- Beef Carpaccio $4
Thinly sliced carpaccio topped with greens, capers, and mustard aioli. I will be honest... There has been a few times when the carpaccio has been chewier than preferred but I'm hoping those were a few one offs. The past two times I've visited, the carpaccio has been on point! 

- BRIO Burger $6
Never disappoints. Comes already precut in quarters to share and the patty cooked to your liking. Also served with a side of homemade chips which are always delicious 

- Black Pepper Shrimp and Eggplant $6
My favorite!! I don't think I've met someone yet who hasn't enjoyed this dish. Sautéed shrimp paired with small pieces of breaded eggplant - smothered in a creamy reddish black pepper sauce with just the right amount of spicy kick to it! I can easily devour an order of this myself 

- Tomato Mozzarella Salad $5
Slices of tomato and mozzarella topped with basil and greens tossed in a light vinaigrette. Balsamic drizzled on top - a very light and refreshing salad

I personally indulge on their wine during Happy Hour - $5 for quality wine is quite the deal and the pours are great. Love their house Chardonnay. 

I've been to Brio for lunch and dinner (they have a delicious bleu cheese steak salad and a variety of tasty pastas) but I'm definitely more a promoter of their Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!!!  We tried most of the happy hour items and they were all delicious.  The sangria was outstanding.  Our waiter Danny provided very attentive and professional service."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.  Happy Hour.  So good, so inexpensive!!  We took a group of 10 for happy hour to celebrate my birthday.  Not only that, but there are Brio gift cards at Costco.  So it was quite the deal.  Between all of us, we tried everything on the happy hour menu.  Everything was really good.  My fav, beef carapaccio  was terrific and so plentiful.  There are lots of decent wines on the 5$ list.  The favorite mixed drink of our group was the Italian lemonade (vodka)."}
{"text":"Had lunch there this Sunday, and we liked the experience. I wasn't impressed by the décor, but didn't bother me either: as long as it's clean, I'm fine with it. I care more about the food and the service :)
The field greens salad was simple and nice and the bf loved the lobster bisque. We shared the vodka pasta, and even though it looked small, it was just enough food for the two of us."}
{"text":"Lunch Menu/Service Review

I met a client here for a lunch meeting, along with a couple other co-workers. Luckily we arrived before the lunch rush at 11 AM, right when they open. We were seated in the expansive dining area at a large booth. The server arrived right away and took our order.

Bread service - comes with sliced white bread, kind of dry, and seasoned toast points. Olive oil/balsamic come along for the ride, as well as butter. OK.

Next up - raspberry iced tea, incredibly sweet, obviously some sort of soft-drink style concoction, not great.

Main entree: Pasta BRIO - \"Rigatoni, grilled chicken, seared mushrooms and roasted red pepper sauce\" - $14.85

While pasta was well-cooked and sauce was delicious, chicken pieces had something to be desired. Mushrooms however were a nice addition, although I didn't get any hint of the searing, it seemed like they were just cooked in with the pasta. Overall, OK, but for the price kind of deflating.

Price points my party felt were a little out-there compared to the quality and quantity of the food we were served. 

Coffee service after the meal - a very strong brew accompanied by individual creamers for each person in the party (I liked that).

Service - good and on point.

Atmosphere - Nice when we arrived, but as the dining room filled up it became VERY loud and it was hard to carry on a conversation, especially business-related since we didn't really want to yell into any other person's face over the noise.

Overall - A-OK. Better than most chain Italian restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this isn't just your average Yelp review, we actually had our wedding reception at this Brio location this past Sat, Aug 16th 2014, and we could not be happier. We live in Los Angeles and were planning a wedding in Las Vegas, so I was very nervous about planning this via email and telephone, however the GM was extremely kind and helpful. First off, lets start with the fact that this location doesn't even have a \"wedding\"/or banquet room, the first time I called the manager informed me about their other location closer to the strip that had space to accommodate large parties and I explained to her that because our ceremony was in Summerlin, we wanted our reception to be there too so that guests wouldn't have to drive so far back and forth from the strip. She completely understood and welcomed our business. So, instead of taking up the majority of their restaurant on a Saturday night, they gave us the patio as well as a wrap around lounge area. Again, I was a little skeptical about the idea of my reception being on a patio, but we were running out of time and options within our budget and we booked Brio mostly because of their kind professionalism and because the food sounded delicious.

So, we began planning our menu, I emailed the GM probably around 20-30 times in the course of 3 months, and every time she responded within 24 hours and never seemed bothered or irritated. She allowed us to have table decorations and when I explained I was worried my family member would miss the ceremony due to setting up the tables, she offered to have some employees set up the dining area for us, and never even mentioned a service charge. Amazing. Also, she accommodated us with our menu choices completely and everyone in at our reception said the food was amazing and that they were going to look up the nearest Brio in their areas.

 I'll save you all the sob story, but basically we had some hiccups at our ceremony (insane photographer) and we were about ready to tell the limo driver to just keep driving and not even take us to our reception when we pulled up to this amazingly beautiful, twinkly lit patio that took both of our breath away. We ended up having the most amazing reception. We danced. We drank. We laughed. We cried. It was everything I wanted for my wedding and I have Brio to thank for it. Not only did our reception at Brio make up for a pretty lousy ceremony, they also told us \"not to rush\" and to \"stay as long as we're enjoying ourselves\". That is amazing. The servers not only went above and beyond all night long, they were attentive, personable, extremely quick and one of the girls even danced with my brother who has Down's Syndrome. She was such a sweetheart. I have never experienced such great service along with such amazing food in such a beautiful restaurant. Brio truly has it all. We are eternally grateful because you gave us the most beautiful wedding reception we could have asked for."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque was Amazing!!! I went back they changed the menu around. I tried the new stuff but it was bland or burnt tasting and I loved the old menu but I was really sad and disappointed perhaps it's a new night chef but the lobster bisque didn't taste the same either... I will give it one more shot though..."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the only reason I come to Brio- where you can stuff your face for less than what one drink costs! You have to sit in the bar area to get the happy hour menu. Bar service is always fast, but you will be within earshot of the employees which is always a fun time. They talk a lot of crap about one another or their personal lives, which shocks me every time! I've sat with a couple of friends in the booths in the bar area and occasionally had female servers with bad attitudes, but I suppose I would too if my customers only came in between 3 and 6:30."}
{"text":"we come here all the time for happy hour. love the food and service! I highly recommend the spinach dip and the flatbreads. So yummy!"}
{"text":"My mother and I tried Brio for the first time today. The customer service was outstanding from the moment we stepped foot in this place. Our waiter took his time to let his General Manager Jesse know it was our first time and he personally came to greet us and suggested his favorites on the menu. The food was amazing! To top it off Jesse even had dessert sent to us on the house. BEST cheesecake you will ever taste! I will definitely be coming back! 
Thank you Jesse and your team for exceeding our expectations!"}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome food! I met some friends for a late lunch and had the chicken marsala, wow!! Very flavorful & good portion. Our server was on top of it too and had a fun personality. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Oh well, Brio is one of my favorite restaurants for the happy hour meals. Everything tastes delicious, I would recommend the burger, the eggplants, shrimp cocktails, 
each dish is 2.29$, nothing can beat that
cheap and the food is good
strongly recommend"}
{"text":"I love to come here for Happy Hour from 3-6 pm or 9- closing because everything on the menu is so good. My favorite is the Carpaccio, I ate 3 orders myself in one sitting. Only con for me is that the happy hour menu is pretty limited and anything that is not on happy hour menu is a little pricier than I'd like. I would definitely keep going back for happy hour!!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for good service. Brio delivered.

Once we got seated, we were shortly after greeted by our server with two waters. Seems small, but understand the difference between being asked would you like a water, and the anticipatory service of deciding for you, \"here is a water. You need it to live. Drink it... or not. It's there for you to decide.\" 

Our server was a bald, white gentleman who referred to me as \"my man\" a lot. It made me feel like he was the Caucasian Denzel Washington straight out of 'Training Day,' and if I'm being honest... I didn't hate it. Endearment aside, he was also incredibly attentive, hospitable, and patient with my indecisiveness. More on that here:

I couldn't decide what to eat. The menu was one page long but it was intimidating. I'm an Olive Garden loving Italian food kind of guy (aka basic AF). I wasn't ready for foods I've never heard of, cheeses I can't even pronounce, etc. It seems all to much for me. Our server quickly took note of that and took it upon himself to create a pasta order from scratch collaboratively with me. It was incredibly kind of him to do. Shout out to the White Denzel! He's a real one.

I ended up getting a fettuccine pasta with both alfredo AND marinara sauce, with an order of grilled chicken breast and grilled shrimp as add ons and that meal was F-I-R-E! I probably would have been the loser that came here for soup and bread if it wasn't for him out of sheer intimidation. 

I'll be back for happy hour next time. I hear its poppin."}
{"text":"The food is always consistently good, BUT the service at the bar is horrendous.  My friends and I come here often and sometimes get the same bartender, Nicole M #224.  She is not attentive or pleasant.  It's always the same with her, so I finally decided to speak up.  I'm not sure how management allows this."}
{"text":"The beef carpaccio is the best thing on the menu. With those free crackers they bring. They should bring more. Seasoned to perfection... Way more!"}
{"text":"really good food & a good bar.  the location is good too.  definitely gone back numerous times.  parking is a bit of a pain, but not horrible and they have valet, although i think valet is the biggest scam around."}
{"text":"I was quite pleasantly surprised by my meal at Brio. I had the salmon al Fresca and it exceeded my expectations, it was quite delicious. Bread was just ehh at the beginning of our meal. My house salad was fresh and tasted pretty good. Our server was pretty good but it was obvious she was super busy all night. I had to wait until after I finished my meal to get my 2nd glass of wine because she was so busy... Wasn't sure what the point was then but oh well. My sister had the chocolate cake which was pretty phenomenal and I had a mocha crumble gelato. Overall, not a bad meal!"}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant and the hostess continually is extremely rude. It ruins the experience when the greeter is rude to you several times. It is otherwise a nice place, however I don't recommend it due to poor customer service."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday for $5 Martinis and for Happy Hour in the bar area.  Almost every seat was taken, except for 2 chairs at the bar.  They were located on Rampart Blvd in the Tivoli Village in Las Vegas.

We ordered 3 appetizers and a couple of Martinis:

Spinach, Garlic and Artichoke Dip:  The dip came in a small bowl with parmesan flat bread.

Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant:  The bartender recommended this dish and it was very good.  The egglplant was lightly breaded.  We needed some complimentary bread to soak up all the sauce.

Shrimptini:  We ordered one each.  There were 8 good sized shrimp on a bed of lettuce in a martini glass.

My friend ordered a Pomegranatini with a slice of lime and a Flirtini with a cherry.   She liked the Pomegranatini better and would order it again.

We would order all 3 appetizers again and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great surprise. Took clients there and family and was always great food and great service even when crowded. Good overall value"}
{"text":"The Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant appetizer is to die for!!! A must try when dining here!"}
{"text":"Hand-Made Pasta in house... Great creamy Red Sauce. Crab Cakes with real Lump Crab Meat... Appetizer calamari was light and flaky with the right amount of Breading. Our waiter (James W) was awesome and delightful, like he wanted us there."}
{"text":"Though we live pretty close to Tivoli, this was our first visit to Brio for dinner.  Our last attempt was for Happy Hour a year ago, but we bailed when we were directed to sit on the side of the patio in which every seat was in full sun -- and it was 112° outside!  Happily, though the temp was five degrees hotter tonight, we ate in air-conditioned comfort.

We were with friends who are soon-to-be locals (if the husband ever gets his way), and our waitress, whose name I unfortunately don't remember, was extremely attentive and efficient throughout the meal.

For starters, we ordered the Bruschetta Sampler platter.  None of us realized until we were biting into different tastes that it was made up of all the different bruschettas they offered.  Some had prosciutto, some broiled tomato, and some were heavy on the balsamic (this is a good thing).  We enjoyed it a lot.  We also liked the Spinach and Artichoke dip, with the crunchy triangles of flatbread that accompanied it.  

Brio tends to have a Mediterranean flair that tries to up it a notch from straight Italian, but for me this wasn't a plus.  I do love the food at Mediterranean restaurants, and am also a fan of Greek cuisine, but I'm not keen on feta cheese.  While trying to decide on an entree, almost everything I wanted to order had feta.  Happily, I was able to substitute gorgonzola in the Mediterranean Shrimp dish I settled on.  I could have also changed it to parmesan.  Four nicely-broiled shrimp sat atop a delicious melange of orzo, farro, broccoli, and artichokes.  I haven't had farro before (though I have a package of it in my pantry waiting for me to cook), and I liked the nuttiness that it added to the mixture.  If I hadn't already been full from the appetizers, I might have thought that there should have been one more shrimp on the plate.  Then again, it was 14.95, the shrimp were meaty, and I was stuffed before I started.

Two others ordered Chicken Milanese, and the third had Filet Mignon, which came with veggies and his choice of crisply roasted potatoes instead of the mashed it came with.  I didn't taste them, but they looked like a small version of potato skins without all the toppings, and he really liked them.  The Chicken Milanese was covered with mozzarella, which is unusual.  Add some red sauce and they would have had chicken parm.  That was served with a side of linguine in a plain tomato sauce.  The chicken was reported to be tender and perfectly cooked.

We shared a bottle of California Riesling; I think it was Wente, and wasn't overly sweet or dry, just right.  My only nit was the bread, because the dense bread with the hard crust that I love turned out to be sourdough.  I don't like sourdough, but others will disagree with me.  Other than that, it was a very enjoyable meal.  And we'll try Happy Hour again if the heat wave ever breaks.  Like in October  :)"}
{"text":"Went here for my daughters birthday, small portions, overpriced. We had to fill up on bread because they were so tight with the food portions, I got the crab cakes 23.00  and I had 2 small greasy crab cakes a few green beans and maybe a few pieces of roasted potatoes.
Whenever we go to a restaurant we have leftovers, not here we had to keep asking for bread because most of us were still hungry. I had to ask for a water refill 2-3x so the service was not that great either. It was a Friday night and it was so so noisy it was hard to have a conversation.
Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I love going to Brio's happy hour ! There are select plates for $3.95 and mojitos for $5.00. I typically get the burger ,crispy shrimp and the pizza. It works out great because my coworkers can order one item each and we just share of each others plates. The Mojitos really hit the spot after a long day at work . They are nice and sweet! The patio area also has comfy couches you can sit on but I would suggest bringing sunglasses when dining in the patio area because the sun can be  quite strong. Brio has the cheapest Happy Hour I have experienced. You would think for the price they would skimp on the food but their portions are big enough to share!"}
{"text":"9/18

Checked out their happy hour- select apps $2.95 each!  However, no specials on the alcoholic beverages, with a quick glance at the wines-by-the-glass revealing prices of about $9 and up.  Thank goodness Total Wine and More was holding its grand opening (w/ a penny wine-tasting!) that day... Violeta and I decided to try a few apps here and then head straight to Total Wine for the liquid component :)

I should make a correction to the last statement above- it was I that tried a few apps- the Sliced steak brushetta and the Brio brushetta quattro,\" while Violeta H. tried the Margherita flatbread.  My apps were both outstanding!  I could probably be satisfied w/ two orders of the steak brushetta (loved that Tuscan Italian dressing!), while an order of the brushetta quattro would suffice (it's their burger, quartered, and a side of homemade potato chips).  While I had my hands full w/ the two apps AND their great sourdough table bread (there were also some great-looking seeded crackers/flatbread, too, but I couldn't try it due to food allergies), Violeta confided that she loved her Margherita flatbread.  

Brio Tuscan Grille's happy hour, despite the lack of discounted beverages, provides impressive hors d'oeuvres at exceptional value.  I'll definitely visit again =)"}
{"text":"Stopped by yesterday for Happy Hour; the bar was packed. Seating was only available outside. The staff was giving disclaimers about how busy they were and service would take some time. Despite the disclaimer the server did her best to serve me with a smile and provide a satisfactory experience. 

My only complaint is the lack of misters on the patio. This is Vegas, misters are a necessity.

By the way the eggplant and shrimp is the best"}
{"text":"Spent last Saturday cruising the Tivoli Village Farmer's Market and once we'd loaded up on Kettle corn and asparagus, we decided to grab a bite to eat.  Having dined at the Brio in Town Square, and enjoyed it several times, we decided to give this location a go.

The patio was lovely at 11am on a Saturday. We managed to get there before the rush, so we had our pick of seats and it was quiet and very relaxing. 

Our server wasn't the best in the world. He was a tall slim guy (though all the servers seemed to be super tall and slim) with a huge band-aid on the side of his neck. I assume this was to cover some kind of tattoo, but it wasn't that appetizing, i'll be honest.

However, because he was so soft spoken and meek, I thought maybe he had some kind of life-saving throat or neck surgery and cut him some slack.  His service was super slow and he forgot about us a few times, but I refused to let it ruin the brunch and let Mr. Potential Cancerous Goiter and/or Criss Angel Tattoo off without griping.

The peach bellini is TO DIE for. So good and comes in a giant pint glass. I thought it was going to be a simple bellini in a champagne flute, but no, this was like a booze slurpee. For $7. I'll have two next time.

I had the eggs benedict, which was absolutely delicious. The grilled asparagus that came with it was gone in 30 seconds. I like my poached eggs on the medium-well side and mine came so runny they were almost cold inside (which I realize is how some folks like them). But the manager, who happened to be walking by, had them remake them, despite my protests. She was really attentive and personable. I should've gotten her name -- she's got long dark hair and blue eyes, kinda on the wee side.

I'd definitely go back to this location, especially  for brunch. There's some berry stuffed french toast I've got my eye on..."}
{"text":"I stopped into Brio for a mid-week lunch with a large group of co-workers.  After quickly arranging a couple of tables, we were seated promptly on the large patio.  The first thing I noticed, and really my only complaint, is that the patio chair are insanely uncomfortable. I've never worn ass pants, but perhaps this is what it feels like.

Our server was very friendly, and helped us newbies with the menu. There is a nice selection for lunch with reasonable prices.  I had the Grilled Salmon Fresca, which was a perfect portion for lunch. It had grilled red peppers, asparagus, sweet potatoes, spinach, and tomatoes.  On top was a small portion of feta, some fresh basil and a light drizzle of balsamic.  The Salmon was grilled nicely and overall the dish was light and flavorful, just perfect!

The inside of the restaurant is spacious and very classy.  It looks ideal for a romantic date night.  Although I only had 1 meal here, I would definitely recommend Brio!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Brio the home made lemonade is great if you are not a wine drinker bit the house sauvignon is also great with most of the dishes tonight I had the calamari and pepperchini appetizer which is delicious. For my entree I went with the pasta alla vodka and added shrimp it has a nice little spice to it and the pasta was cooked perfectly AL dente  my gf had a mixed seafood pasta dish that I tasted it was also very tasty. One thing I have to say as a downfall was that our waitress seemed to cater to the bigger tables and just check on us when she felt like it but we had a good table convo going so it wasn't that big of a deal. Prices were fair for the food we ate I see a lot of company's about that on here but this is vegas own your wallets people come on. All in all a very nice dining establishment and being in town square would be a really cute date spot for you lovebirds out there."}
{"text":"Chicken pesto pasta was very Bland and simply put a glorified Top Ramen. Sorry guys who missed the mark on this one!  Although the dish left something to be desired the decor was very elegant and a very pleasant dining experience.

10/13 very impressed that within days I got a phone call from the manager at Brio.  She was very apologetic about my disappointing experience and even sent me a nice personalized note in the mail.  I look forward to trying a different dish and hopefully it will be a better experience. Look out for an update!"}
{"text":"It was our first time here. Our service was wonderful and our food was delicious! I loved the aesthetics and interior design. We will be coming back whenever we come back to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great attentive hostess and waiter. Fantastic atmosphere!  Great artichoke dip with fantastic flatbread.  Lobster bisque is fantastic along with an entree of Lobster Shrimp Fettuccine making for a great meal. I could sit and eat here all day, the Lobster Shrimp Fettuccine was perfect from the perfect noodles to the balance of everything .  Compliments!"}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here with my husband recently. I enjoyed the crab and shrimp cakes with roasted vegetables ... very tasty particularly when paired with the Santa Ema Sauvignon Blanc. My husband was very happy with his Pasta Pomodoro and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"My husband and I love the atmosphere at Brio Tuscan Grille.  Upon walking in the door we were greeted by five smiling friendly faces at the hostess desk.  As a hostess walked us into the dining room I asked her to seat us at a booth, which was not a problem since It was early in the evening.  Our waitress was just as friendly. We ordered two appetizers and savored every bite of the crab and shrimp cakes and gorgonzola lamb chops...YUM!! (These appetizers are also listed on the menu as entrees.) My husband ordered a fish special as his entree.  I don't recall the fish name though our waitress explained it was similar to sea bass.  So far everything we ordered was perfectly cooked...moist with plenty of blended flavors.  The entree I ordered was spicy shrimp with orzo and vegetables. The veges were tender though the shrimp was a bit over cooked. I'm crazy about orzo...this was extremely oily. After several bites I gave up on trying to justify the oiliness.  This wasn't our first time at Brio and certainly not our last. Their menu has so many scrumptious sounding items I'm getting hungry writing about them!"}
{"text":"Had shrimp vertuta, sauce was like soup. The chopped salad starter was wilted. What Italian uses feta cheese on pasta and salads anyway. Service was good, food was Horrible! Not even remotely authentic! Never again!"}
{"text":"So I'm here eating and the manager is completely rude. After all our food was sent back and the cooling vent leaked all over me. We call the manager over to ask/bring to her attention all the discrepancies we had. She should've came over when the food was sent back initially but she didn't. She acted like a complete bitch!!! Wasn't even thinking about accommodating us and when I told her I was writing a review the bitch said as she was walking away \"You do that...\" to be that rude and unaccommodating in this type business is really ridiculous."}
{"text":"Very good.  When you check in you get a free appetizer! Every yelper can get excited over that. I chose the spinach artichoke dip and it was good, on the heavier richer side but yummy! Than I ordered the sliced steak salad which was delicious but drenched in dressing. We finished up with the lava cake which was AMAZING! So decadent. They had chocolate ice cream on it instead of vanilla and I loved it! The bite of cold ice cream warm cake  and hot filing was just SO good. I'm talking drive her again just to have the lava cake good.  Worth the splurge on calories"}
{"text":"We got here at 730pm and it was an hour wait so we took our chances at the bar and got seated right away. We started with 2 red sangria paired with the beef carpaccio, calamari and bruschetta. The beef carpaccio was good But I had better at Giada. Calamari you can't go wrong crunchy and tasteful. The bruschetta is the best! Assorted toppings with different flavors, highly recommended.
For dinner we share the Bistecca Alla Fiolentina a 14 oz strip steak which was very tender, juicy, and mouthwatering. it was paired with mash potatoes and grilled vegetables. Overall, I gave Brio a 4 star because of the server, she told us the appetizers came in small servings. So, ordered 3 and it filled us for the dinner. Plus, the sangria was sour and watered down."}
{"text":"This place never seems to disappoint in the area of food.  The management and leadership can still use a little work.  The open at 11:00am and first the girl  had a hard time unlocking the door and keeping it unlocked.  Once she got past that everyone was let in and from the first person on, you were told it was a 5 minute wait to be seated, REALLY???  There was no one seated yet, what was the 5 minute wait for?  

We requested to be seated outside but when our name was called the person taking us to our table took us to a table inside.  We told her we asked for an outside table and were taken back to the front and told to wait while her and the host figured it out.  In the meantime, other people were seated both inside and out.

Finally we were taken to our table outside.  There was no one else sitting on that side yet so there was a wait for the server to be notified that people were starting to be seated in his area.  

From this point on, everything was awesome.  I had the 5oz filet with sweet potatoes and asparagus was cooked more towards medium rare then medium which is not unusual for this kitchen but none the less it was good.

We also had a salad which was amazing.  At the end we ordered cappuccinos and some desert.  When mine came, I noticed it had cinnamon sprinkled on top.   I called the waiter over and asked if it was cinnamon and he said yes with a surprised look that I was even asking.  I looked at him and asked, Don't you remember I told you I was allergic to cinnamon and we had an entire conversation about this and the sweet potatoes?  He thought for a second and said, oh yes we did talk about that and this was his mistake and he was sorry and would get me another one.  

So even though the food is really good, from the hostess not listening to where people would like to be seated (inside or out), to the kitchen not really preparing food properly as ordered to the server not really paying attention to his customer and the customer needs is the reason for the 3 stars and the statement at the beginning of this about the management needing a little more work and leadership experience."}
{"text":"I have been to Brio many times at Town Square and once at Tivoli.  Tonight the service was so so, but the food was the star again.  This time I had the steak salad.  Often times restaurants just \"phone it in\" on steak salad, but this one was fantastic.  I asked for medium and it was cooked perfectly, very well seasoned meat.  I asked for no pecans and asked for the creamy parmesan dressing instead of the horseradish.  In my opinion, it is THE BEST dressing there.  I will always enjoy a visit to Brio."}
{"text":"Was at the Brio last night,the service was so bad,Hay brio what is wrong with u,,the food was good"}
{"text":"Meh.

I'm not a fan of Italian, but I can eat good Italian.  This was not it.  It felt Macaroni Grill-esque.  The food was heavy and unimaginative.  When I told the waiter I liked Sangria he suggested something not on the menu, I am not joking when I tell you it tasted like a wine cooler.

I'm was thoroughly unimpressed, and shocked that it was so busy."}
{"text":"I am starting a yelp just because of Brio! It was fantastic! Our waitress was Rebecca and she walked us (my daughter& son in law) through the menu. 
I had a delicious mimosa and a great and the portobello ravioli. 
 After dessert I was very happy and so was my family. 
Restrooms were clean and fresh. 
Bar looked well organized. 
Hostess was happy and greeted us as we came in and as we left. 
Management was always present and looked as if he ran a tight shift. 
Thank you Brio!"}
{"text":"My fella took me here on an afternoon we both had off for a nice much  Their bread basket is delicious and fresh!!!I ordered the soup and salad combo with Field Greens Salad and Lobster Bisque....delicious! He ordered the pasta and egg plant off the lunch menu...also too darn tastey to describe! The hostess lacked personality and looked a bit put off and uninterested in being friendly with guests. (Although she did seem chummy with tithed staff.)  Our waitress was super friendly and stayed on top of our iced teas.  We enjoyed our experience and will likely return."}
{"text":"My goodness!  I room a friend new to town here.  I talked it up since I had such an awesome time at the Tivoli location.  Walking in, the AC is so cold that I could see penguins.  We asked to be seated outside and were quickly seated.  We were quickly fogotten.

After waiting for some time, a nice himsel man introduces himself and takes our drink order but never returns. This keeps happening over and over.  Finally we get someone and we ask for drinks before we order.  

We had to keep asking for the bread basket but they kept forgetting. The server didn't know the soup of the day.  Finally we ordered and our food came. The dressing on my Field Greens salad was too heavy on the vinegar and the salad was drenched to the point that the greens were soggy!  My soup got cold because no one brought me a spoon and I had to ask a couple times. No one brought me any crackers, offered pepper or cheese for the soup or salad, or my friends omlette.  Our drinks were often empty.  

Fortunately the manager walked by and we were able to share about our experience.  He was too kind and comped our meal, but I am quite reluctant to return to this location."}
{"text":"Ah the happiest of happy hours! I'm not sure how it took me so long to try one of Brio's happy hours, but I'm so glad I finally did. My girlfriend and I came here on a Monday evening around 6pm and were easily able to snag two seats at the bar. I personally loved the service and set up at this location. It seemed a bit more intimate than the town square one. 

As for food we shared the tomato mozzarella salad, beef carpaccio and black pepper shrimp. I honestly loved everything I ate. The salad was very fresh and well balanced on the ingredients. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of spice to it. The carpaccio was delicious and not too thin like you tend to get at some other restaurants.

100% I cannot wait to come back again and try more of the menu options. You also can never go wrong with $5 drink specials. Thank you Brio!"}
{"text":"When you are tired of paying Strip prices for a meal. Go here we had an awesome meal from sampler bruschetta to steak crusted with gorgonzola and sampler desserts. 

Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Food was great! A bit pricy for my budget but on date night it's a good place to go.

Parking is tough to find but there is a free parking garage half a block south. Easy walk through the stores to get there.

Service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Considering the 3 star rating says \"A-OK,\" I will definitely agree with that. Brio really is a decent place to go for some Italian. I have had mostly their pastas ranging from their lasagna to their ravioli. You really cannot go wrong with these pastas as they should not be that difficult to make. I also will compliment them on their bread before appetizers. I enjoy sourdough so that is my bias, but they also have these crackers that are quite a treat.
My only con on any of their dishes really is their risotto. The flavor is really lacking for a risotto as it tasted really only of those awful pine nuts.
I'd recommend Brio if you aren't an Italian food snob. It's not bad."}
{"text":"I have only one complaint about Brio, but it is really not their fault that the bar gets filled up too quickly to enjoy Happy Hour!! Other than that, you get great delicious food for under $4 dollars during Happy Hour!!! The beef Carpacio, the fried ravioli, the flat bread pizzas and the spicy shrimp with fried eggplant are highly recommended. Beautiful atmosphere and inviting \"al fresco\" patio dinning with fire pits. I have been here too many times to count (parties, happy hour, lunch and dinner service) but have always had great food and service!! Speaking of service, I once slipped and fell as I entered the bar area. I was more embarrassed than hurt. In fact, I was fine. But the wait staff and a couple patrons rushed to my aide. Their concern for my well being was very touching!! The Manger gave me her card and insisted I call her if I needed to seek medical treatment due to my fall at Brio. Happy to report I was fine and I did  not need to seek medical attention. It took longer to recover from the humiliation of the fall than the pain from the fall itself...lol!!"}
{"text":"When for Valentine's Day dinner. We had a 5PM reservation. We had to wait as the table was dirty from prior guests. We placed our drink order and waited 20 minutes for the drinks. Next we placed our order and waited 30 minutes for our salads one of the 6 orders was wrong and sent back. We ordered our dinner as soon as the salads arrived hoping to avoid another long wait unfortunately that did not work and another 30 minute wait endured. Again one order was wrong and sent back. The mashed potatoes were cold and returned again a wait. Lastly we were told they would comp our deserts. Nice but again we waited 30 minutes for the desert.
I was told that they took 900 reservations for Valentine's Day, I don't know if that is correct but they certainly had more reservations than they could handle. Our total time at Brio was 3 hours. \"Unacceptable\""}
{"text":"Brio is always a great stop but Mothers Day brunch was a delight.  Our server Brittany made us all feel extra special.  We will definitely be back and recommend Brio to friends."}
{"text":"True italian rustic, like most Italians this place stuffs you with a ton of food. Breads, salad, main course and dessert...you won't leave hungry."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and Brio has done just swell. Start with a decent wine, of which they have many. You don't have to break the bank to get a good one. We found a nice Ruffino that we liked so much, we had a couple bottles. Small groups do great here -- especially in the sharing department. (The bread/cracker basket is dangerous, be forewarned). 

Now, should you order the carpaccio appetizer (which I recommend you do), be prepared for a large portion that you'll either share, or have no need for an entree.  Good meat, tangy argula and shaved parm: all good.   This second time, I was set to have a salad but randomly queried if there was anything not on the menu. Gazpacho I was told, and yay to that!  It had excellent flavors, and a pleasant texture, complemented with just enough kick. Mmm. And it was cold, of course. Truly an excellent way to start a meal -- especially since it was, um, 110 degrees outside -- at least!

Despite the weather, we were very comfortable inside. Service flowed effortlessly -- or maybe that was the wine. Still, I enjoyed a very good Filet, cooked to order. This is not a steakhouse, of course. Rather Brio has many things they offer - with a Mediterranean way about them. Entrees are typically served with their mashed potatoes (which I couldn't imagine), but our Server was flexible: she easily swapped the spuds for spinach. 

The pastas looked, and I'm told, are good. There was a nice salmon a few folks ordered. Tasted it myself, and it was perfectly fine -- with some memorable flavors that right now I forget. Really, there were no sour notes here. Which leads me to dessert --- always fun with a group. We tried several, and they were all outstanding. Seriously, we must have had three or four we worked on. Top things off with good coffee, or espresso, and you're good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to stop buy when shopping at town square. Simple menu. Good variety of flavorful Italian dishes. Nice peach ice tea. Reasonable prices and good deserts. Tomato bisque is one of my favorites along with some of there signature entrees. Good selection for salad. They also have a diet calorie menu sometimes I see floating around for those conscious. There is also bonfire setting for the colder weather and sprinkling for the summer outside seating areas. Can accommodate large party's very well with seating. Crowd is well composed typically, usually family's and couples dating. Great personable atmosphere with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've got to say that I've never had a bad meal here.  Lacked in the service department the last time I went, but the food was fantastic!  Just wish the overall experience was equal to the food.  For the price and locale, the level of service has to be a step above the rest.  I won't hold it against them though.  In the words of Governor Schwarzenegger, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Horrible dining experience and bad customer service. We were highly disappointed in Brio restaurant service. The food was absolutely terrible and without our consent our orders were changed and customized to a leftover uncooked fettuccine. Never returning to Brio again and we weren't the only unsatisfied and disappointed customers!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Try the steak salad on the lunch menu. Very good! This location and the Town Square location, both have consistently good food and great service. The Tivoli Village location is closer to home, but they are both good."}
{"text":"Sitting on the patio in May, evening time is excellent!
Savored the appetizers - samplers of 3 bruschetta types, absolutely enjoyed the cold Moscato with cod fish on top of tortellini"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Brio in a long time but it was great coming back. The service was good and came right when I was ready to order. 

I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was amazing as always. It was very creamy and the lobster was plump and flavorful. It's just too addictive! The spaghetti bolognese took much longer because they messed up by giving what the chef called spaghetti but was actually not. It was wayyy to thin and flat to be spaghetti. They remade it using actual spaghetti when I explained what spaghetti was LOL. (I would know because it's what I order every single time aEverything was very good and the view from Brio was beautiful on a sunny Saturday with the harvest festival going on in Tivoli Village."}
{"text":"They have the best most accommodating staff !! Thank you Brio Waiters !"}
{"text":"The service that we received yesterday was incredible!  We don't get to have date nights very often, so the hospitality we received was special! Our server, I believe his name was Jessie, was very charismatic, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. From the wine suggestion he made to the help he gave us deciding on our meals- he was an Allstar! We felt like we were a special table even though we know how busy it was. Overall, a great night- make sure you ask for Jessie!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a lovely Father's Day brunch here. The Artichoke spinach dip is wonderful but only enough for 2 people as an appetizer, you so you are aware. Service was spot on, and food was consistently good. Lasagna, Chicken Marsala, Yukon gold mash. Warm chocolate cake for dessert. wonderful!
Thank you Bill"}
{"text":"I love Brio! I used to always order pastas such as Pasta Brio but of late I've been obsessed with their wedge salads! Let me tell you about how savory it is! So it's a big piece of wedge lettuce as a whole, topped with bacon, tomatoes, blue cheese and their house made Parmesan dressing! This dressing is amazing! It's what has me addicted to this salad. I usually order this as a main course with grilled chicken and it is amazing! It's a great meal! 

Also their bread is addicting!! I love their flatbread, it's a top grains and Parmesan. It's delicious! 

I have yet to be disappointed with the service and quality of food. The atmosphere is serene, it can be an upscale classy dinner or it can be casual. I love the patio seating at night and it's a great environment to hang out with friends. 

BTW they have happy hour at 9PM to closing!! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here tonight for my moms birthday dinner and honestly we were really disappointed in our time here tonight. From the get go it was one thing wrong after another. We sat down and got our bread, butter and water. 

We then ordered an appetizer and while we were waiting asked for more bread which we never got until asking a second time. Then when the apps finally came out there was only three settings instead of six. I had to get up and go to another table and grab three extra settings for the rest of our party. Such a rookie mistake on the service. 

Then after placing our dinner and salad order we wait for fifteen minutes for our salads to come to no avail. I finally ask Mandy where our salads are and she said they would be ready in one minute. By that time I'm annoyed because I know that the dinner would be coming out any minute. And I really wanted my salad. Who wants to eat their salad in one minute or eat it with their main course. So I told her I didn't want it but my dad still wanted his. He finally gets his Cesar but as predicted our dinners come out thirty seconds later. They should have held our dinners until my dad was finished with his salad. But the food runners didn't care. 

Then for my moms birthday desert we had to tell Mandy and remind her even though we told the hostess when we made the reservation. Why do the hostesses ask if we are celebrating anything if we have to tell our server in front of our mom that its her birthday? 

They comped our appetizer which was nice. So one star for that. But we really just couldn't enjoy our dinner fully because of the lack of attention to detail with the service. This is probably our last time here."}
{"text":"This is for the Crocker Park location. The atmosphere is very pleasant. Very large room with a  Tuscan feel. Erin was our server and did a wonderful job! Dad can be difficult. Happy Thanks Giving! Grandma couldn't make up her mind. But the food was prompt and delicious. We were celebrating Grandma so Erin brought out a little cake with a candle in it, so nice. The desert was caramel, coconut and creamy yummy! I will come back!"}
{"text":"Before we set foot in Brio, valet is quick and friendly to park my car.

The decor in this place is awesome. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. And the food? I've never had a bad meal. The risotto and Ravioli di Bello are unreal. The carpaccio is huge! I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great Italian experience in a modern atmosphere. Ciao!"}
{"text":"The experience at Brio Tuscan Grille was not one bit short of SUPERB!  My family couldn't stop ranting and raving about this place for days, and I was tickled to have pleased such a difficult group!  I had my son's graduation lunch here.  He graduated from UNLV last May 13th, and we were all from Los Angeles.

From the moment I contacted Brio's Banquet Team, Nova (Banquet Manager) was so wonderful to communicate with... so patient and careful to answer all my questions quickly since we're from L.A..  I tried the big Vegas hotel buffets first and most of the banquet/catering staff were difficult to deal with -  very slow to respond and I never felt like they even cared about my small but large party of 25.  They really made me feel like we weren't a big deal to them.  With their high prices for the Mother's Day weekend, I had high expectations so my patience wore thin very quickly.  Brio did not even require a deposit for our event, yet Nova had a clearly written Event Proposal showing the details of our meal selections and the pricing.  No surprises!

Like clockwork, we were seated at exactly 2:00 pm as stated on our Event Proposal!  Then we met THE MAN....  Amit, our head server!  He was an amazing guy who lit up our tired selves with his positive energy and excellent service skills.  He said we were his first large group, but no one believed that!  The food arrived also like clockwork... it was almost like a staged show.  The intervals were perfectly in sync with our guests' eating behaviors.  We couldn't believe that service!  First drinks, then appetizers, then salads, the main course dishes and dessert... all perfectly timed in harmony.  The entire time, Amit was checking in with me, in constant communication with me and on top of the whole game.  Even small details like no empty drink glasses and lemon wedges were never forgotten.   By the end of dessert, we were about to take this man home with us to L.A., he was so good!!!!  The entire family loved him and just could not stop speaking kind words about him!  

The food was amazingly awesome... from the calamari, to the lemon chicken, to the grilled salmon... and that amazing \"we wanted to lick the plate\" vodka pasta!!!!  The dessert was the icing on the cake....  caramel marscapone cheesecake in small cups topped with whipped cream!  Delicious to the last bite!!!!   All were scrumptious dishes that warmly satisfied our hunger pains after 5 long hours of graduation ordeals and traffic. 

Nova, Amit and the BRIO Banquet Team -   A HUGE THANK YOU FROM THE SANTOS FAMILY OF CALIFORNIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WE LOVED EVERY MINUTE THERE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't look for food now based on what sounds good. I ask myself what haven't I Yelped? For lunch, the answer was Brio. While sitting in the car outside the restaurant I consult my Yelp application on iPhone and noticed Matt S. had been there and reviewed the restaurant just last week. One thing I have learned, if Matt says its good, its good. 

The first impression I had walking in was \"wow!\" The deco was awesome - the fabric covered chairs reminded me of the Hotel Monaco, the style and detail was something I wouldn't expect to find in Gilbert. Service was excellent - Tom, our waiter, arrived quickly and asked if this was our first visit. He offered to bring some water while we familiarized ourselves with the menu and upon his return, he went over the specials as well as introduced some of the more popular plates. The bread and tortilla was excellent - nice herbs and flavor. 

Following Matt's review, I ordered the spicy eggplant and shrimp appetizer. Tom said it was the best app on the menu. The eggplant was fried, topped with a shrimp and bedded in an excellent spicy sauce. Yum!At $9 it sounds a little pricey for an app, but it was great size. Even if we had a party of 4, there would still be enough for a couple per person. As it was with two of us, there was plenty. 

My friend ordered the Mezza lasagna & insalata - the salad was a smaller version of one of three standard salads (she chose the Chopped Salad). The lasagna was good, not very thick, but definitely rich. It wasn't outstanding, but had a good flavor and was very cheesy. The price was $12.95, which wasn't bad considering a side salad alone is $4. Good value with the combo.

I wanted something a little different. I went with one of Tom's suggestions - the Eggs Oscar. Many, this dish was loaded with flavor! Two poached eggs, a small crab & shrimp cake, potatoes, asparagus, artichokes, spinach, red peppers and topped with lemon butter & hollandaise sauce. The size of the portion was huge and worth the $13.95. 

The reviews for dessert were good, and I do have my Happy Finish list to work on, so as tough as it was, I had to push forward. It is for research after all. I am not doing this for me, but for all of the Yelp readers...Tom brought out a plate of 8 mini desserts and a cake. There were 3 types of Crème Brulee on the tray, tiramisu, cheesecake, cobbler and apple nut bread pudding. It should be mentioned that this mini desserts are only $2.45 - you can order the crème brulee trio for $6.50 or the dessert sample featuring the other 5 items for $10.95. Good deal if you have trouble deciding. We chose the cake and wow! Save room for dessert!! This was a chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream, chocolate ganache, what they called vanilla whipped cream, but it was more of a vanilla sauce (excellent) and a dusting of chocolate powder. Topped with pirouette cookie. 

The total bill was about $45, which is a little high for brunch, but the service was great, atmosphere excellent and food incredible. Definite happy finish with the dessert.  As others have said, this is definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"I had high hopes of decent Italian food here.  The decor is beutiful, easy parking etc.   But OMG,  this is garbage.  I had Veal Marsala with a side of linguini in aurora(pink) sauce.  So awful, I returned the dinner for a refund.
I eat this same dish made by Italians in my small town and I have eaten this same dish worldwide.   Unedible.  Marsal sauce tasted like the brown sauce on a beef dish from the age of hot airplane food.  the linguini sauce was so awful.  I am not sure this corporate restaurant chain even has a clue about italian food."}
{"text":"Friends have raved about Brios in other parts of the country, so I finally went to the one near me. Absolutely loved the Pasta alla Vodka. Handmade pasta filled with ricotta cheese, bits of prosciutto, in the best vodka sauce ever. My friend ordered the crab cakes & also loved them. Great service, nice atmosphere, all around wonderful dining experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE this establishment! I have eaten here at this location twice. My first experience with the Brio was at their Rancho Cucamonga location. I had ordered one of their flatbread pizzas which was good but not nearly as good as my friend's short rib. She shared some of hers with me and that's where my love affair began. That taste of heaven remained with me ever since... I went back and ordered it for while in Vegas for my birthday. They serve it over a cheesy polenta along with Brussels sprouts and oh my goodness.. the flavors all meshed together so well. This was the best meal that I've had in a restaurant. Unbelievably delicious. The short rib is fork tender and melts in your mouth. Full of flavor! I was also given a caramel mascarpone cheesecake for dessert. Perfect sized portion and very rich and decadent! Soooo good! I ordered it again yesterday during a late lunch and their steak salad which was really delicious. Service and quality of food has been outstanding at both locations. I'm really surprised that they don't charge more for their food. Their price point is excellent for what you get. highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for a great dining experience.. A great pick for a special occasion. Very nice ambiance too.. Don't forget to order the short rib and the cheesecake! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch after peak lunch hours around 2:45pm. We made a reservation and the hostess at the door is nice and friendly. She seated us right away after verifying our reservation. 
   I really enjoy the ambiance of this restaurant. They have both outdoor seating and indoor booth/table seating. It has high ceiling and private room area for small parties. It gives guests an European feeling which is hard to find here in Vegas. 
   As for the service, I can only give 2 stars max, Our server is very nice and he seems to know a lot about the dishes but he does not check back with us often enough to make sure we are ready to order and we are satisfied with our food. As a matter of fact, we had to get someone to get him to take our order. Same situation with the water too, we always have to look for someone. 
   We ordered two dishes and shared, Crispy Eggplant Pomodoro and Mezza Chicken Limone. The Eggplant is dry and the sauce has nothing special, while the Mezza Chicken is juicy and tasty. Probably not going to order the Eggplant Pomodoro next time.
   I saw a lot of good review in regard of happy hour at this place, Would love to give it a try."}
{"text":"you can never go wrong with Brio. They have a good variety of options and pretty much everything on their menu is very tasty. I would highly recommend this place for happy hour. You can not beat their prices on their food and drinks
services: Good
prep time: 15 min
atmosphere:  trendy, clean 
Best Thing:  free bread !! :)"}
{"text":"Definitely worth a try, great food and Perino on tap, my favorite beer."}
{"text":"This place is great. Delicious food, delicious drinks and friendly staff. The Sangrias are bomb and I had a strawberry rum Fresca thing I can't remember the name of that was divine, in fact I had two. The salmon salad is my go to and it was perfect. It was a beautiful day and we sat outside."}
{"text":"Really nice looking, high-ceilinged (is that even a word? LOL) venue with a great waitstaff and hosting staff.

The food was definitely delicious, but I'm from New York, so it takes a lot to impress me with italian food.

I got nothing against the place, it's actually the best italian that I had when I was out there. I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a few weeks ago with my co-workers. Everything was first rate, the drinks, the food, and the service from Michael. Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Years ago I use to really like this place, but now I'm disappointed and amazed that this restaurant stays in business. Located in the Scottsdale Quarter, Brio should be standing right alongside many of the other good corporate owned restaurants in the area, but it falls behind in both food and service. On a quiet Sunday afternoon the place was not busy. I arrived before my friend and sat at a table in the bar area. I waited nearly 10 minutes before the Bar steward came over to greet me and give me water (in hot Phoenix August). My companion arrived but still it took 15 minutes before our waiter even brought over menus. The waiter seemed preoccupied, but eventually we ordered appetizers and a main course.......but still more waiting with nothing but water on the table...finally the waiter came over with some bread saying that he had been waiting for a fresh batch to be ready (well he could have told us that!) But the bread wasn't even warm just dry and unappealing. Our appetizer Brushetta Sampler finally arrived. There was no consistency or freshness about it, pieces of the Brushetta bread must have been cut from a stale loaf because they were really really hard, and the meat on the other pieces was unedible even though the bread on those was much softer. 

We kept waiting for our entree to arrive (45 mins) and it wasnt until after we flagged the waiter down that we found out for some reason he had not put in the order! Forgot to put in the order? Its not like it was a swamped busy Friday night! Finally after nearly fainting from starvation our one entree of Angel Hair pasta with Tomatos and Pesto arrived (we split it). After only a few bites we both realized the pasta was barely cooked! I know what Al Dente is and this was not it. If this was suppose to have a Pesto sauce on it it failed miserably, it was dry,  unflavorful and frankly I was embarrased for the cook.  Seriously? A restaurant of this caliber serving unedible food? Come on were in Scottsdale no less! And the waiter seemed to just disregard that we were there even though there was only one other couple in the bar area.  I was trying to be patient, I was trying to give the place the benefit of the doubt....maybe they only had one cook today, maybe they were short staffed?? I kept looking for a reason to like my experience there.

By this time we thought OK, lets have dessert and coffee since everything else was unedible and we're still hungry. We ordered the Carmalized Cheesecake with Strawberries. It arrived looking nothing like a normal cheescake slice. Upon sampling it we couldn't figure out if it was a cake or a cheescake.  It had a lone Strawberry on it but no sauce. The flavor or lack thereof was indescribable. We didn't finish it. It was also horrible. How can you offer a tasteless cheescake?

Eventually the manager came over realizing that there were problems and he tried to make amends but by this point there was no reason to order anything else, we'd spent over 2 hours in the place with each dish beingreally bad. Luckily, he comped most of the meal but I felt bad for him as well. As a manager he should have been aware of food quality, any problems that might be going on in the kitchen, overseeing staff and checking in with customers as they dine.... regardless, there was no excuse for this terrible food and unprofessional service. I'm normally a generous tipper but this waiter missed the mark completely. it gave me and my friend no reason to even want to return. The only highlight of the meal was the company, the water....and the friendly Valet parking attendant! He got a good tip from me."}
{"text":"This was our second visit to Brio Tuscan Grill.  The food is very good and fairly reasonable.  The biggest problem we encountered was one of meal timing.  We ordered our dinner, a salad, and a bottle of wine.  The salad came out very quickly.  Before we were half finished with our salads, the entrees arrived.  Finally, the wine showed  up.  I felt we were being rushed so they could turn the table over sooner.  Not sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Went to Brio for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the place. The house cab-merlot blend was really good and not expensive at all. We ordered the artichoke-spinach dip to start and the service was VERY fast. The dip was a very generous portion, plenty to feed 2 people. After the appetizer, we had the grilled salmon and shrimp and crab cakes, respectively. They were very flavorful and filling. Both of us were pleasantly surprised with the speed of service. I would most definitely come back to Brio."}
{"text":"Brio is delish, plain and simple. I have yet to get something that isnt tasty. I live about 15-20 miles from one so I dont get out there too often but I do wish there was one closer to my area."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour last Friday and had such a great experience! I was greeted as soon as I walked in. Your host kaylee was super helpful with describing the happy hour menu and very sweet. We got the peppered shrimp and burger which were both delicious. And our server gave us remarkable service everything came out at the perfect time. Great place to spend Friday night with my husband. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here on 05/28/2015. I ordered the Grilled Salmon and enjoyed it. It tasted fresh and the cook/ chef put the perfect amount of sauce. The entree was on point, but the service wasn't.  The server forgot to ring in our appetizer and she also made a mess on my table by spilling water while pouring it. She never tried to at least dry it. One thing I do not get about this restaurant is why they only hand out one dessert menu if there was 5 of us on the table.  I had to wait for my turn to look at the menu and while I was picking my dessert the other people in my table already ordered and the server had to come back to ask for mine. In summary, I had to watch my cousin and her friends eat their dessert while I waited for mine. That was ridiculous! Well, at least the dessert was on the house since the server forgot our appetizer. She made up for it. I lost desire with this restaurant. I thought I was going to have a blast..."}
{"text":"Ate here with esposa and our two daughters.  It was a beautiful Scottsdale afternoon, so we sat outside.  Our server was top-notch from start to finish: witty, personable, and knowledgeable.  Ambiance is nice and comfortable.  Menu offers a nice array of Italian offerings.  Everything was very nicely presented, fresh, hot, and flavorful.  Wine list is a bit limited, but has excellent choices.  OVERALL: VERY GOOD.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant!  They have a lot of options on their menu, and all of them looked delicious.  The atmosphere can't be beat; it's a beautiful restaurant with a charming ambiance.

Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Whenever we ran out of bread or water, he was there immediately with more.  When asked for a box to bring our leftovers to family, he offered to put fresh bread in with it.  He had a great attention to detail.

There were three of us enjoying our meal there, and we all loved what we ordered.  I had the sweet potato and chicken risotto, and others had the lasagna and the salmon.  All of the food is plated and presented beautifully."}
{"text":"Ravioli portobello was AMAZING and so was the Margareta flatbread!! The other pasta we had was so so."}
{"text":"Normally Brio is great, you know what your getting but the time I went to this location it was sloppy. Everything was thrown together as if the staff was anxiously waiting to get off and had checked out for the day.

The food was fine but no one was paying attention. We waited forever for a refill on the water, our burger came out at the wrong temp, we asked for sauce and small things on the side and they never came. Dissapointing Brio, step up your game !"}
{"text":"Totally overrated and overpriced. I've been out to eat there three times now. Usually I go grab happy hour because they have a pretty good deal. So this time I went in for my birthday and had a pretty bad experience. To start off they put us (8) at a small circular table that was cramped. Next the server would disappear for 20 minute intervals and we had no idea where he went. The server was anxious and highly stressed running around and wasn't able to play close attention to such a large party. That was just the beginning. The food was sub-par. I ordered a $29 8oz filet medium rare and it was like I was chewing gum. Usually, a filet that price should be cooked the way you ask. Maybe it's the style of restaurant or chef but I received the rarest steak. I had to eat food from others at the table to be satisfied at all. My sister ordered the salmon and had to send it back because it was extremely overcooked. She has been a server for 12 years and has some kind of knowledge on food. I think for the price the food should be much higher quality. I was there for my birthday and definitely won't be going back for anything, maybe the happy hour. I hope they get this message and make some changes."}
{"text":"Service was great. Waiter Jeff was very attentive and pleasant. Husband had Pasta Pesto. 560 Cal but felt like more. Good job. Very filling.  Had a double cappuccino and fantastic lava cake!!  Good lunch spot."}
{"text":"The food and service are really good. My husband and I had seafood pasta dishes. I especially like the dessert menu. The list of \"dolchinos\" come in little espresso-sized cups and only cost a couple dollars each. We had the orignial creme brulee, chocolate peanut butter creme brulee and cheesecake. Yum!"}
{"text":"I love brio. Great food, great environment, great service. But I can only speak for the location at town square. Waited about 10 min for anyone to come up to our table from the moment we sat down. Then they messed up on the appetizer salad and didn't come out till after our main entree. After we were done we waited even more. About 20 min or so till we got some service and that's because I had to go up to a manager to ask. And all this waiting we were watching our server walk past us many times without any acknowledgment that we were in his section. Never would I have thought I would have a horrible experience here. They did at least do the right thing and comp'd a bit off the bill. But free things aren't important. We were just looking for an apology and customer service. (Tivoli village location)"}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night and dinner was amazing. We started with a nice bottle of a red blend wine and ordered the calamari and sampler bruschetta. Calamari were crispy and tasty. The sampler was a nice size for five of us and was good. The bread was a little hard but it did taste good.  We ordered dinner: roasted whole chicken, campanella carbonara, pasta pesto, mezza grilled marsala chicken and I had the balsamic braised beef short rib.  Everyone seemed quite happy with their dinner choices. Mine was amazing!!! The meat was so tender, no knife needed, cauliflower puree was seasoned beautifully and the roasted carrots were perfect and mushrooms just as tasty, totally complimenting this dish. Of course some how we managed to make room for dessert and we ordered a couple of the caramelized Brio cheesecake to share. Perfect ending to a lovely dinner. Our glasses were filled promptly and the staff was very nice. I would say the only possibly negative thing was that the appetizers took a little long in coming out... but we had bread and we weren't in a hurry. I will be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"We ate here the other day. Nice looking restaurant with outstanding interior design. 

Food:
Carbonara- I was so hungry so this dish hit the spot. I love carbonara spaghetti so I may be biased. So good and love how they put a large amount of food.

Service:
The staff were nice. The service was fast and we made it on time for work during lunch time."}
{"text":"My line sisters and I needed to find someplace to eat and exchange secret Santa gifts & we picked Brio. We came a little earlier than 3:30 but they let us sit at the bar area & wait. They gave us waters while we waited for HH. 

We fit 8 people in the booth - pretty squished but we fit! As soon as 3:30 hit, our server came over to take our order. Each of us ordered 2 plates and some drinks. I got the Brio burger and the black pepper shrimp. I normally don't like burgers but I really like brio's burger! I think the bun is pretty heavy though so I usually take the top off. I think my favorite dish off of the HH menu though is the black pepper shrimp. It's sooooo good! It's like a curry dish with shrimp and eggplant! Order it. You definitely won't regret it. For drinks, I got the white peach sangria. I went to a different Brio and thought these were pretty strong but it wasn't as strong here. 

The service here is also really good! They did, however, took a long time to bring one of my sister's burgers... and didn't bring it over until we were almost done with our meal. They also forgot to bring a flatbread but compensated with bringing a bigger flatbread. Lol"}
{"text":"I've been of age for quite sometime and idk why I waited so long to come here for happy hour... and I love happy hour!! I'm actually not quite sure the exact time of their HH lol I think it's from 4-6? Or 5-7? Somewhere around there. Anyway, upon arrival, you seat yourself by the tables at the bar or just at the bar. 

There were 4 of us at the table and I'm pretty sure we ordered everything off of the HH menu. There wasn't a lot to choose from but a good variety! So I'm not a big fan of burgers but the burger they had was actually really good - I was very impressed. I think my favorite though was the shrimp & eggplant dish! Really rich & creamy & just super yummy. I don't think there was anything that I didn't actually like, which is surprising lol. I also had one of their sangrias - I believe the white one. The drink was delicious, not too strong. 

The lady who was serving us was really nice, but I think she was the only one back there. She came to our table maybe once or twice after our initial order & there was a good amount of people there. I would suggest staffing more people back there for HH so they're not so stressed. But will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went here for a late lunch. We ordered the eggs Benedict, steak bruschetta, crab and shrimp cakes, Margherita flatbread, and lobster bisque. All was pretty tasty and nothing spectacular. 

The reason I gave it 2 stars was because the wait staff seemed slammed even though it was like 3 in the afternoon. The other reason was that the lobster bisque came in a bowl but was only filled halfway. I asked why was it filled halfway? The answer given to me was since all food was hand/tray carried they only filled soup halfway. The problem with that is from the customer's perspective; it just feels like they are shorting you. Most if not all restaurants carry their food out on trays and my soup is always filled to satisfaction but not here."}
{"text":"Brio Tuscan Grille at Town Square is a nice Italian restaurant to take family and friends when  visiting Las Vegas for the first time.  The food is full of flavor and fresh. I eat there at least once month.

On Saturday I had brunch with a friend. My server Erika was friendly and informative of the entrees. She was concerned that I was ordering to much food since their portions are large, so she convinced me to split a Cesar salad with my friend instead of ordering one for myself.  

Erika was right, it was too much food, I was stuffed after eating my Calamari appetizer,  Cesar Salad, and one omelet with roasted potatoes.  Yes!!! It was to much food. 
Thanks Erika for having my back!  I also witnessed Erika's interaction with other patrons, and she was polite, professional and friendly with each encounter. 

A few things I would recommend, is to offer refills on beverage service without me having to ask. Trying to flag someone down for a refill for my Arnold Palmer was annoying. In addition, when serving an appetizer for two, please bring serving utensils, it was difficult to serve ourselves without any cutlery or spoons for the sauce.

Brio should have a loyalty program for their regulars offering lower priced cocktails and food. 

Cheers & Bon Appetite!!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the worst service ever. Sat for 45 minutes with no bread or inquiry of our food order. Finally ordered food including flatbread. 20 mins later manager can over (who has since disappeared after multiple attempts for his reappearance) and told us they had no thawed dough. Seriously. It's Friday night at 8:30. 
Had to ask for bread again. Had to ask for food more than an hour in when all other tables had been fed. 
Asked for manager again. Assuming he slipped out the back. 
Food fine. Horrible service.

Comments stand. Since writing, Brio did the right thing. New manager Larry comped everything. Other manager never reappeared. Bad experience but they do the right thing. Thank you Larry."}
{"text":"Ahhhh Brio... sweet Brio....

When I saw those pics of the beef carpaccio - I was sold. I didn't realize, however, the grand SIZE of this dish.... best bring a fellow foodie to savor this delicacy- it'll become a sweet memory for y'all... \"remember that one time we split an arms length worth of beef carpaccio??!! Yeah.. GUUUD TIMES!\"
Just go for it...

My person & I ordered the same dish after much deliberation and bouts of indecision .... lol. We both ordered the pesto pasta and man.. A+. Had lots of vegetables & good amount of chicken... just all around GUUUD. highly recommend. But really- everything on their menu looked worth trying.. so I'm planning on swinging by for that. 

we also split a side of mashed potatoes ... auguuguh amazing.com.org.edu.uk.usa.gov 

AND we didn't forget dessert ... I forget the name of it but it was a chocolate cake filled with chocolatey liquid goodness... with some raspberries & vanilla gelato I believe !! I DIG IT.

Our server was pleasant & polite .. it was a busy Saturday night so we were glad we made reservations ahead of time! We only had to wait 5 minutes to be seated ..

YOU GO BRIO!"}
{"text":"We decided to give this restaurant a 2nd chance for dinner.  We started off with a shared Caesar salad. My wife ordered the crab and shrimp cakes that were accompanied by roasted vegetables and creamy horseradish. My entrée was blackened ono served over garlic mashed potatoes with a trace amount of Hollandaise sauce and topped with a spoonful of a delightfully spicy charred tomato relish.  My fish was overdone and there was very little, if any, garlic in my potatoes."}
{"text":"Conveniently located in a great neighborhood is all I can say for this trip?  Service was professional and friendly -most in our party were happy with dinner - just wasn't my day, I guess?  :-( .  Restaurant and restrooms were noticeably... well, could be cleaner?  Meals were small in portion, wine was way over-priced for the offering or am I spoiled by COSTCO?  ha, ha.  Fry cook for a chef?  Don't order the Salmon.  I've been very please in several visits in the past... don't know if there was a change in managers or the kitchen might just be having a bad day?  I'll try em again - and might pick up the tab next time :-) Thank you Bob, for dinner - the company was awesome!"}
{"text":"My family and I literally didn't even get to sit at a table but the \"We're just getting a table set for you.\" Yeah okay lady. 20 minutes later and still not seated! Nice. It was someone in a suit type thing that came up to us. Assuming she's a manager. The host and hostess both ended up seating a couple that came in 10 minutes after us. HA. What a joke. Off to cheesecake factory we went!"}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch on our way home from the airport and a little shopping. What a pleasant surprise. This restaurant is plenty large for ample seating and is a very nice ambiance with classy atmosphere, Delicious meal choices and a great selection of wine. 
We usually share to avoid over eating and had the shrimp Mediterranean \"specialty\", shared the chopped salad $4.95 entree addition and a 9oz glass of rose.  It was perfect for two! I would certainly return here again if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Refer to my review of Brio Tuscan Grille at Town Square: http://www.yelp.com/biz/brio-tuscan-grille-las-vegas#hrid:72dL3FhMlp7omkE4eh5lLA

My fiancé and I first experienced this location at their grand opening event benefiting AFAN (Aid for AIDS of Nevada) in April 2011. We were immediately impressed with the set-up and interior of the restaurant. Compared to the Town Square (Las Vegas) location, it has an \"open\" feeling since the whole seating area of the restaurant is under one beautiful canopy of drapes. The outdoor seating has a beautiful view of the center of Tivoli Village.

I thoroughly enjoy both Las Vegas locations and merely choose one based on where I am in the valley at the time!"}
{"text":"From my first visit in 2008 to many, many visits in the last five years, I have enjoyed EVERY meal and experience. Perfect for an intimate evening with your beau, a light lunch with your shopping partner, or a celebratory meal with a group.

Having dined here so often, there are few dishes I haven't tried. These are my favorite that are classics and, unfortunately, some items that have since been removed from the menu (seasonal, making room for new dishes):
CALAMARI FRITTO MISTO: It's no surprise that I love calamari and it's one of my *benchmark* dishes to try at new restaurants. I like their batter, the lightly-battered peperoncini that creates a nice, refreshing note, and their delicious marinara for dipping. I do not like the creamy sauce (not really sure what it is) that is also served.
LOBSTER BISQUE: This is definitely one of the best lobster bisques (or bisques in general) that I have eaten. Nice pieces of lobster and this version is finished with a touch of sherry. Delicious. BTW, the cup is enough; trust me, don't go for the bowl unless that is all you're planning to eat.
POLLO AL FORNO FLATBREAD: Grilled chicken, tomatoes, bacon, feta cheese, green onions with a tomato sauce and creamy parmesan. SERIOUS YUM. The bread is the perfect thickness, creating the right vehicle for this delicious medley of ingredients. Sadly, this is no longer on the Vegas menu!
CHICKEN MILANESE: Romano breaded chicken with herb spaghetti served in my favorite sauce - pomodoro. The breading is crispy without overwhelming the dish and I love their interpretation of the pomodoro.
CHICKEN LIMONE: PIccata-style chicken with a blend of lemon, capers, and white wine - another preparation I really enjoy. The chicken breast is always juicy and the sauce is tangy. They used to serve it with their cripsy potatoes (large chucks of well-fried/sauteed potatoes with herbs and peppers - think \"Potatoes O'Brien\"), which I really liked.

There are many salads, appetizers, pastas, flatbread, and bruschetta that they offer, I've eaten, and have enjoyed very much. You can't go wrong! The only dish that was less than satisfactory was the Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto; bleh.

This year, they introduced \"The Lighter Side of Tuscany\" with menu items that have reduced calories (I believe they are all below a certain amount, say 600). I tried the INSALATA BRIO: Mixed greens, roasted red peppers, grilled asparagus, tomatoes, grapes and candied pecans tossed with an Italian vinaigrette and balsamic drizzle. Just 345 calories! Well, I removed the gorgonzola and asked for the dressings on the side, so that I could get it as \"Vegan\" as possible. Very delicious!

They have a specials menu that is updated daily, so make sure to check it out because their seasonal cocktails are certainly worthwhile. Some of my favorites that were offered in the past (and I believe one may have become a permanent menu offering) are the STRAWBERRY BASIL LIMONATA (Muddled strawberries and basil in a limonata, so refreshing and yummy) and the APPLE CIDER MARTINI (A little brandy, apple cider, spiced rum, lemon juice, rimmed with cinnamon, YUMMM). I've recreated both cocktails at home and it has consistently been a crowd-pleaser."}
{"text":"Fantastic decor and spacious.  The most amazing desserts and scrumptious salads.  I really enjoyed the lobster bisque and the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto was phenomenal!!!  I also like how they didn't prepare their Sangria cheaply with a carbonated beverage.  Couldn't quite pinpoint what they put in it, but whatever it was... I'm a big fan!"}
{"text":"Danielle was awesome.  So genuine and knowledgeable about the menu.  Quick and prompt service even though she was busy in lounge.  Happy hour is from 3:30-6:30 in bar and lounge.  Ask for her if possible."}
{"text":"Written by Kyle's wife- Deb Stantus :) 

I can't begin to say enough great things about my experience. I'm from out of town so planning my sisters baby shower from Arizona was a bit nerve wracking. Nova could not have been more helpful! He gave incredibly helpful and detailed advice, was patient with my many questions throughout the process and ensured that every single request we had was accommodated. He went above and beyond throughout the entire experience which gave us such peace of mind. We were grateful to be working with him on this and would highly recommend both him and Brio to many friends and family!! I also want to mention Matt, who we spoke with one day throughout the process, who was also extremely helpful with his advice on the menu and updating a few things for us. They make a fantastic team! Responsive, professional and incredibly accommodating and happy to help. On the day-of the event, Mauricio was a lifesaver!!! He helped us hang so many signs and banners that we could not have done it without him. He was also so patient and happy to help. This made the morning set-up so much easier and brought our vision to life! We could not have been more grateful to have his help throughout the entire morning. Both Mauricio and Nova deserve kudos for executing the event perfectly both in advance of the event, and on the day of. We truly appreciate this as it made a very special day for us memorable and all the guests had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Really friendly waitstaff; very attentive and aim to please. 

The food was really good. I made a mistake and didn't realize pancetta was bacon (I don't eat pork or shellfish) and as soon as I realized it was bacon in my dish, they said \"No worries, it happens all of the time, we'll take care of it!\"  7 minutes later, I had a brand new dish without the piggy. My husband and friend both cleaned their plates, so in assuming they liked what they ordered. 

The ambiance was nice. Open, well air conditioned, and not too loud.

I really have no complaints. I wasn't \"wowed\" but it was really tasty, and I can see myself coming again and again when friends are in town on the strip and we need a solid and central place to meet and dine. Town Square is great. 

I'm going back next weekend with a group and if I have another great experience, I'll up it to 5 stars. :)"}
{"text":"This Brio location is a great restaurant as a whole. The design is beautiful. The staff is wonderful. The food is very good. Collectively the group I was with had salmon, shrimp, their peach beverages and chicken fingers. Everyone was very happy with their food and drinks. I would highly recommend this restaurant !"}
{"text":"Happy hour are the best hours to go! I was in town square and had gone here before. I decided to see their happy hour menus to enjoy.

Variety on happy hour is limited but their regular menu items have a wide variety. The food is good it's and the drinks were really good as well.

The service was normally they seemed a bit impatient maybe it was because he bar area was packed for HH. 

I'd go back since the food items have vegetarian options."}
{"text":"We only went for happy hour, but we spent $35 between the three of us and left stuffed. The ravioli was out of this world! I will go back just for that and also the eggplant fries. Everything was so good! No drinks this time, but I'll try them next time :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and we've had issues before but this takes the cake!  We sat in the private area due to the amount of people already dining.  Totally fine, Brio does have a nice private/patio area with a fireplace. After sitting for awhile, my friend found feathers in my hair which was really odd.  But then, a bird pooped on my arm- it is good luck and we were in an Italian restaurant.  The dove was stuck up in the rafters and could not leave the area.  The server did know the bird was in the rafters, but didn't seem to care either way.  I didn't make a big deal out of it, just odd.   I moved to another chair and below the chair was a woman's feminine product-wrapped.  Again, odd.  Then we got our food.  The roasted chicken was pretty dry and over cooked.  This is the second time, I've ordered a meat entree and both times, the meats were under cooked or overcooked.  To top the night, I chip a tooth.   I'm not sure if I will go there again, never really a great experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 2 dozen times and never had a bad experience 
I love the Bellinis and the happy hour
Been here for large parties with friends and family. 
Parking may be a bit tricky at times
But it's central location is a good pit stop 
I shop at the Victoria Secret, and Bebe regularly"}
{"text":"Food was excellent!  Decor was fabulous! Would have given 5 stars but was a little bit noisy.  Will absolutely be going back.  Soon I hope!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Nothing but the best here.... we took my parents for there 43rd anniversary and they had an amazing time."}
{"text":"We got in here without a 50 minute wait that was the option at True Food, which is our go-to place in the Q.
The service was excellent and the waitress got me a nice cushioned chair from inside that made me comfortable.
The starter was very good, Bruschetta Quattro, or something like that. But I had the Mediterranean Pasta which was just blah! My wife had Salmon salad which was OK but nothing special. I was tasting my dish and just thought that nothing stood out at all. I do not use dressing or flavoring so it was just not tasty food.
I guess we will stick to True Food, it has a long wait for a reason."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good menu selection. Food and presentation were very professional . I would definitely return to this location.  They are able to handle/serve large groups without difficulty. For an Italian restaurant, there are a lot of steak options which is nice :) Overall this is a nice restaurant, not your typical stuff you up on bread and feed you pasta kinda place. Good for business meetings, date night, meeting friends etc."}
{"text":"I was here last month for my birthday and had  8 friends join me. I was debating if I wanted to do anything in the first place and finally decided a couple days before to go to Brio. I hadn't been here in a while and forgot how far in advance to make reservations.  Luckily they were still able to squeeze us in.
The food and service was great! They gave me a birthday surprise with my dessert which was beyond what I expected.
Thank you!"}
{"text":"Brio is on of my favorite happy hours!  No, they don't offer drink specials, but they do offer some tasty treats at $2.95 each.  The portions seem to have gotten a bit smaller since they first started doing happy hour, but it is as delicious as ever.  The specials are also only at the bar area or patio area, so be sure to snag the first seat you see; it's first come first serve.

My favorites have been the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant (you have to scoop up every bit of that sauce!), Braised Meatballs and Polenta (I had no idea what polenta was before this, but now I love it), and the Sliced Steak Bruschetta.  There are many more items on the menu but these have stood out to me the most.

Dining outside is great, especially in front of a roaring fire on a cool fall evening.  Inside is nice but it gets loud.  My biggest complaint is the service; it can be difficult to get your waiters attention, even though it's been a while since they've checked on you.  Still, the cheap eats make this a must try."}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic. Came in with my family of 5 on Saturday evening. Had to wait a few minutes for a table, no big deal, as a party of 11 came in before us. We got seated near the bar in a large booth, but the table was itty bitty. Especially for 5 adults. 

By checking in on Yelp, I received a free appetizer. We got the Margherita Flatbread, and it was delicious! Rather big, perfect for sharing - enough for all of us. I can't remember everything that everyone ordered, but my mom and I split the Grilled Salmon Salad and it was SO good! Splitting it was perfect size; they do offer 1/2 sizes on the salads. All of the food came out very quick as well. 

Our server wasn't the best, he was very slow, and not good with recommendations. It felt as though he didn't want to accommodate my brothers request to change sauce on one of the pastas, as it took away from the taste or something like that he said. He was also very, very slow. He was too busy leaning against the counter by the computer at the end of the bar, drinking his beverage, and flirting with another server. We had to ask the manager to refill our drinks. 

The restaurant it pretty large, very clean, and well decorated. The bar is rather big too, and they have a few TV in there. I will definitely come back here next time I am in town.

5 stars if the service was better."}
{"text":"I just have to say how incredibly impressed I am with this restaurant. I have been planning my Vegas wedding since February and was having a hard time finding a place that was elegant with excellent food without breaking the bank. Nova is the banquet manager there and he was truly amazing. He addressed my one million emails prior to the dinner and was a true advocate for helping me have an outstanding dinner even when I lived in another state. It was stressful being so far away but Nova made it easy for me. 

Let's start with the food. I had visited the restaurant before I signed a contract to try the food. The chicken milanese was great but the real highlights were the filet  and also the pasta with vodka sauce. The pasta was handmade and to die for. We were also served two types of salad and potatoes/veggies. Everything was great but my wedding group raved about the filet for days. Who would have thought you could get such a great steak at an Italian restaurant. 

The service was great. Tamara was fun and very concerned about making sure I was a happy bride. I paid for a bar package and was not disappointed. The staff was very attentive and took multiple drink orders. I definitely felt that we got more than what we paid for. The servers also cut and served our cake that we had ordered. 

Overall it was a fantastic experience and I am sure that we will go back each time we visit  Vegas to relive the memory. Thank you so much Nova and Brio Tuscan for making my wedding so memorable."}
{"text":"Excellent food & great service! The staff was prompt and the food was delicious. Nice plating. I especially enjoyed that they have a lower calorie options menu. Did not expect that from an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely love this place! If we could eat this everyday, we would do with a smile on our face every time.

We always get the beef carpaccio. The. Best. Thing. Ever. Everything about this appetizer is delicious. If you can handle rare beef then I suggest you try this appetizer. It's so good one time my bf and I went and they were all out of the beef carpaccio.

My boyfriend always gets the lobster bisque and every time he orders it. He's never disappointed. Ever.

For me, I either order their lamb chops or their salmon. Always really good and tasty.

As far as customer service, they are very kind and polite. Always on top of things I don't recall them ever asking them to refill my drink. 

I didn't hesitate giving This restaurant 5 stars if that's not a good enough for you guys then I don't know what is."}
{"text":"If I could give ten stars I would!  Brio staffers, including Nova as the coordinator of our wedding reception, were phenomenal.  I was not able to get them our place cards before the event, and they not only improvised where I had not provided these, but they made everything beautiful for our reception.  The food was amazing (guests LOVED the menu) and the service was truly exceptional.  The staff took time to make the centerpieces look perfect, the cake table decorated with their attention to detail and everyone just made our guests feel pampered and special.  After all this, the prices are some of the most reasonable on the strip.  We will be repeating our vows again, and will definitely be long-time fans of this restaurant and staff!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant with prices this high, I would expect a better meal. The food is decent quality, but definitely nothing special. The wait staff is decent, but definitely nothing special. I have only been here for work dinners, but would not necessarily choose to come here on my own."}
{"text":"I was with a party of 10 on a Friday night. The place was packed. Because of how busy it was, service was quite slow. For appetizers the table ordered calamari and spinach dip. The calamari was good, the white dipping sauce that it came with was straight mayonnaise. I couldn't believe it. I hate mayo with a passion. That killed it for me. I ordered the Grilled Salmon Fresca substituting the sweet potatoes for mashed potatoes. The plate came out looking beautiful. The salmon was very good, cooked perfect. The mashed potatoes were bland, had no flavor, I don't even think they used salt. That part was disappointing because I love mashed potatoes, that's usually the part of the dish I eat first. For dessert I had Tiramisu. I wasn't thrilled, I've had better from the Smith's grocery store bakery. Overall I give this place 3/5...I'll come back to try other items on the menu on a not so busy night."}
{"text":"Brio has become a classic staple for both casual family dining, and date night with friends. My husband and I had our wedding rehearsal dinner here also, so it's near and dear to my heart.

You start off with a basket of free bread, and Parmesan crusted sesame crackers that are delicious. I ask for oil and vinegar as opposed to the butter that comes out with it regularly.

The menu has a wonderful variety of salads, pasta, fish, chicken and steaks. My favorite menus items include: the strawberry chicken salad, steak salad, and chopped salad , the ricotta stuffed pasta in the spicy vodka sauce, the lobster bisque,  salmon Fresca, and also the beef medallions. I'm picky about my steak being cooked all the way through, and they always do a great job.

This place is also super kid friendly. Crayons to color on the paper tablecloth, and the most delicious kids size Mac and cheese that is easily shareable for two children. 

Brio, don't you go anywhere."}
{"text":"Beachbody dish: 2 fillets of Blackened Salmon, medium rare, over chopped salad
Plenty of good protein with a healthy serving of veggies

Another good protein snack is the beef cappacio, ask for no salt / light capers to cut down on the sodium

I miss their linguine frutti de mare (shellfish pasta on red sauce).

Basket of bread is complimentary after you place a food order and use your Brio rewards (give either Brio # or the registered phone #) to earn $ off or free meals.  They have a generous rewards program and it's worth it."}
{"text":"Last night's dinner at Brio was wonderful! Our waitstaff Rosie was superb! She deftly attended to our party and we never had to ask for anything. The atmosphere was warm and inviting. I had the Chicken Limone. The lemon sauce was tart like I like it and the chicken was tender and juicy. The veggies of carrots and zuchini were standard. The mashed potatoes were good. The dessert! Oh the dessert I had! The chocolate lava cake was scrumptously delicious!!! Triple yummy for chocolate lovers :)
I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant while looking for a Hello Kitty store for my daughter.  Undecided as to where we were going to have dinner, somebody suggested Brio.  We took one look at the menu and we decided to try it out.  Sitting outside in the middle of December is not highly suggested, thank God they have heat lamps!  For starters we had the spicy shrimp with eggplant per our server's suggestion...it was really good!  I had the Shrimp and Scallop Risotto (also our server's suggestion), substituting the risotto for their yummy fresh fettucini.  It was good but didn't hit the spot since it wasn't was I was craving for.  The servings were huge, the price reasonable.  Will definitely suggest this place to friends when they're in town."}
{"text":"Understated Classy for a corporate chain. Menu is meat heavy but at least they have calorie counts to let you know and a sub-600 section.  Chicken limone was a standout,  especially with angel hair instead of potato.  Desserts were very reasonable in price and size.  Wine list is very accessible with the sustainable IL putto a bargain. Service was great and the Table fly-by chef Jimmy was a nice touch.  Recommend"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. They still stand for something and keep the community entertained. 
Brio has a lot of events like a paw on the porch . The food is amazing. I literally have to stop going to the 3-6 happy hour ! 
The service is amazing and I appreciate the mist outside ."}
{"text":"Have to give this place five stars! Visiting my friend here in AZ and she brought us here for happy hour. The food was delicious and drinks were outstanding, the service was awesome and the prices couldn't be better!"}
{"text":"Well what can I say. Even my favorite place can have a bad day. Arrived back in the country and planned to top it off with a nice meal at out favorite restaurant.  9:30pm I'm guessing isn't their favorite time. No receptionist, waited about 5 to 8 min. People around but no one paying attention so we figured we could sit at the bar and get service there. No luck. Went to the front  to search down a menu and was confronted with a server that was kind enough to give me two. For the next 10 min with three to four servers and bartenders within 10 feet, we were totally ignored. Shocking to me, not the Brio I know. Waited a little longer and there was no attempt to acknowledge us by anyone. We stood up and slowly walked to the door and it seemed they were happy to see us go. Lack of awareness was stunning. Can't rate the food or service , we never received  either. Wake up Brio you are better then that."}
{"text":"Stopped here after we went shopping for some clothes over at H & M and I'm glad we came in here :)

The space speaks for itself. It's large and open with vaulted ceilings. 

Customer service is very formal and inviting. 

Portion sizes are generous as well as the costs haha.

If you feel like stepping it up a notch from your average dining experience but still don't wanna break the bank then this is a good choice for Italian food lovers :)"}
{"text":"I went to Brio for a work dinner, and as usual I loved it. We started off with the spinach dip and the bruschetta and both were really tasty. For my entree I ordered the Filet and it was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend this dish, if you're in the mood for steak. I went with a group, so I was able to try several other items as well. The pork chops were delicious, but I don't eat much pork these days. If I did, I might order this myself. The lobster bisque was just okay. The last thing I tried was the Shrimp Mediterranean and it was the best of all. It's served with orzo pasta, which is my favorite.

I've been to Brio several times and I have yet to be disappointed. It's a place that I know I will visit again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The food was ok, but the desert was FANTASTIC.  Try the Creme Brulee cups - it came in pumpkin, peppermint and cocoa flavor. 

Would come back to the Square on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I came here for Happy Hour with my girl friends for their tasty appetizers and drinks. Happy hour is served only at the bar though, so it was a bit cold when we had to sit outside during the winter. Luckily they provided heat lamps and had curtained off the outside area.

My favorite appetizer is the black pepper shrimp with parmesan eggplant, it has a very flavorful sauce. I used the complimentary crusty bread to sop up all that deliciousness. The crispy eggplant fries are served with a fantastic creamy horseradish sauce is very tasty and the beef carpaccio with capers and topped with mustard aoli and shaved parmesan cheese was also very good. 

The tomato margherita flat bread is simple and straightforward, nothing special. The Brio burger is decent and was sliced in fours to share. The roasted garlic, spinach & artichoke dip is served with parmesan flatbread was also good. And of course you have to wash down all those appetizers with a dirty martini or two. They have pretty good happy hour items and prices and I always have a good time here."}
{"text":"I enjoy Brio every time I visit. The service is often top notch, the bread and butter at the table is delicious, and it has some of the best lobster bisque in town (pairs perfectly with that bread and butter!). Sometimes the food is a bit salty or has an unexpected kick. Otherwise, the experience is great. Don't be surprised if one of these days you find me devouring some lobster bisque in the corner like a scene from Beauty and the Beast... Don't mind me..."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is with national or regional restaurant chains lately.  I've had nothing but bad dining experiences there, as compared to smaller 'mom and pop' family run local eateries.  In any case, we have been going to Brio's for years, and do like the food there.  However, two weeks in a row, my shrimp dish (Shrimp Fra Diavolo) was served undercooked and even raw!  This might be excusable once, but TWICE?!?!  I think i'll lay low for a while before I even consider returning.

UPDATE (October 2014):  Well, we did return, but i'm afraid I cannot upgrade my rating.  I have nothing against many of the kind and competent servers, BUT our food was served merely warm (not hot, as it should be), and our bill was much too high!   BRIO's prices have gone WAY up, and it cost us a little over one hundred dollars (tip included) for 3 people, whereas in the past, we would typically pay fifty to sixty dollars for the same food.  And we have been customers since they opened, probably having visited BRIO's at least 40 or 50 times over the years.  At this point, we just don't feel that they are a good value, and this is probably our LAST time there!  BYE BYE BRIO's!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and wine.  The guy who brought our water and soda was funny and attentive.  Our server Julianne (girl) wasn't very impressive though.  My son is autistic and he shook her hands, after she took our drink order, my son wanted to shake her hands again, and she said \"no more, we already shook hands.\"  I was shocked!"}
{"text":"WOW What a experience I had with my fiance. The Chef Sous Michael specifically came over our table to welcome us. (This does not happen to me)

Michael has a warm, friendly personality that anyone would like. We spoke for a while and I felt I knew him for years because of his magnetic personality.

I ordered the Grilled Salmon Fresca and my fiance ordered the sliced steak bruschetta and this food was the best I have tasted in years. 

I want to compliment the Brio for having personal like Chef Michael. 

We liked it so much we are going back Saturday !!!

Thanks again Chef Michael  !!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Now all of you reviewers need to tell me what you did for service?

Regardless if happy hour is discounted pricing, you all understand that's probably one of their busiest times of day. 
Considering its the time of day people are getting out of work, if you hand a menu to someone and disappear for 30 minutes it's hard to sit still. 

We came in at the beginning of happy hour! Seated ourselves near the little booths by the bar. It took 13 minutes just for a menu. NOT COOL.luckily my boyfriend and I have some amazing conversations or else I don't know how else to let the time pass. 

We eventually got our menus l, took a look. In a matter of minutes, especially after waiting so long for a menu, we finally are ready to give her the rundown on everything we want. 

We keep seeing the same server rush back and forth so we keep waiting. After we see her and have her tell us she's about ready to take our drink order, she looks over and sees a party of 20 rush outside. 
Where do you think our server went?!

Never got to put that drink order in :( 
All we wanted was a nice happy hour!
After all, grandma had the little one all day so we might as well take advantage. 

After being so patient to try out this elegant restaurant, we thought maybe yard house was a better choice. They know us there so there's never waiting for a drink! 


Maybe we gotta be dressed lookin like a million bucks, or go with a fat group! 
I wanna try it again, my man was just really tryin to get that happy hour on so it might take a little convincing."}
{"text":"An old friend of mine turned me on to Brio and I fell in love! I have never experienced bad service at the Tivoli Village location. The down fall for my husband and I is that the bill can add up quite quickly, by the time we have added drinks, salads and a few of those little mini desserts. It's worth it though, the peach sangria (get the pitcher) is yummo, and those mini desserts are even better! 
My husband can be a picky eater too, and he is always able to find something on the menu that he can eat. The kids menu is pretty good too, the kids hamburger is huge and they love the fries!"}
{"text":"I have been to Brio a few times prior to this and each time has been nothing special so I never thought to write of those experiences. On Monday a friend of mine and I decided to eat here after some shopping. There was no wait and we had the pleasure of being seated in Amanda's section who was an absolute delight!! I could not have asked for a better server or better service! She was extremely knowledgeable of the menu, engaged in some wonderful conversation and even joked with us when appropriate. 

We started with the amazing Bruschetta Sampler which Amanda recommended, perfect choice! My friend went with some sort of pasta and I chose the lamb chops with Maple Balsamic Brussels Sprouts. 

After the food was delivered, Amanda checked up on us to ensure everything was great. I actually finally was able to convince my friend to try lamb for the first time. She actually loved it  and we expressed that to Amanda. After a couple of minutes Will, some sort of manager came over and asked if everything was ok, we confirmed that it was and he continued on his way. After I finished the first lamb chop, I took a break to show my friend something on my phone when we were rudely interrupted by Will, the manager. He immediately asked if we wanted boxes. We hadn't even had our main dish for longer than 10 minutes and I told him that I was not finished and I was still working on it. He then said he would go get the check, he returned a few minutes later and said \"No rush!\"  I was kind of confused because there wasn't a wait for seats and there were several tables that had been at their enjoying their dinner longer than we were even in the restaurant. 

Amanda came over and even was confused on why he was bothering us, we explained that we felt that we were being kicked out and were not even offered the dessert menu which we were actually going to order, but since we were made to feel unwelcome we would just pay and leave. Amanda decided to get another manager to come over and apologize for the experience. Jenna came over and apologized and offered free dessert but our experience was already ruined and since we were made to feel like we were not wanted we just wanted to leave. 

We paid the tab and decided to leave. Again I cannot tell you how amazing Amanda was, Jenna was very sympathetic and tried everything change our experience. 

Honestly, Will should not be allowed to work with the public. I do understand why we were basically told to leave before I was able to even taste my side dish.  I definitely will not be back at this location!

I forgot to mention that after this was posted, I did receive gift card in the mail as a way to make peace, but also a personal phone call from Will informing me that he was bothered that someone would feel this was about him, he apologized profusely and even offered to buy me drinks, i kind of feel weird that they gave him my number and he kept me on the phone for a good 30-45 minutes trying to win my approval. It was strangely uncomfortable but at the same time nice to be able to tell someone they were the reason for a low review, just weird he has my cell phone number."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was great! About the same level as Carraba's, but quite a step up from the likes of Olive Garden. Fresh and modern interior, great service and great food. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Been about 3 years since I came for lunch.  Tried it again for a business lunch on Friday.  The place was very busy.  Had the salmon lunch entree with angel hair pasta.  The salmon was good, but the pasta was drenched in too much butter sauce.  The meal was decent for the price, but nothing wowed me."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. Went in for lunch on a Sunday and it was dead. Our waitress was fine but the food made the Olive Garden look like a Michelin star restaurant. I sent back my salad because it was wilted and slimy. The minestrone was super salty and tasted like it came out of a can. My sister's ravioli wasn't good... It tasted like it was heated up in a microwave. My mom got a caprese salad and it was okay but nothing to write home about. The flatbread was cold with very anemic looking tomatoes  and tasted like it had canned Parmesan cheese on it. For $60 with tip, even with the salad taken off, it was like highway robbery. Absolutely the worst italian food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Their service is always great at this location.

I planned a large group dinner for a birthday party & we were able to get a private room. They also helped me surprise the birthday girl.

I always find myself at their happy hour because their drinks are so good. They have $4, $5 & $6 plates & pours to choose from.

I have tried everything on the food menu. If you're with other people, I suggest getting the \"Brio Burger\" for yourself & another plate to share with each other to have variety.

As for drinks, the \"Sangria Rosa\" & \"White Peach Sangria\" are my go-to. They're only $4 & they taste amazing.

Shout-out to Danielle who has been my server a few times & is wonderful!"}
{"text":"i was really disappointed at the price for the food we got.  My \"spicy\" pasta had little flavor.  The pasta itself was mushy.  Hubby got the lobster ravioli, his favorite meal, with a vodka sauce.  Again, no flavor, just mush.  The two starts comes from our server Frederick who was on top of things.  Drinks were always full.  Bread refilled.  He also brought us a free dessert.  The chocolate mousse was wonderful.  I would not go back"}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived in Vegas on 5/15/16 and decided to eat here for dinner. My husband had the lasagna and I had the salmon. My husband said the lasagna was absolutely amazing. My salmon was cooked well and was tasty but it needed more salmon and less veggies. The lasagna was made with a white sauce and it was really good with it. My husband scarfed it down in no time. 
The upholstery was a little outdated,cushions at our booth was torn and the back were worn and stained. Other than the upholstery, everything was good."}
{"text":"The happy hour @ the bar is a lovely experience! The little menu has great pricing (anywhere from $2-$4 I believe) and the bartenders are always witty enough to mix up a drink of your own concoction. The bruschetta & brio burgers are always pretty satisfying."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and service was impeccable. The food is just okay, definitely over-salted. We had the kids cheese pizza (which was generous in size), ceasar salads, the roasted vegetable panini and risotto."}
{"text":"Alex was the BEST! 
Great happy hour and small bites !!'
Try the soup - lobster or musgroom!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by brio and found most everything there to be above my expectations. We went on a Monday night during restaurant week a little later in the evening, around 8 o'clock as I didn't get off work as early as I would have liked. So brio was close to home and felt a bit on the safe side. I guess my expectations were somewhat low because it's Italian food and most Italian chains aren't known for their quality.  We sat in the dining room because it felt like there was more atmosphere than there was on the patio. Our table was great, like a private booth with barrier walls on each side. The ceilings are high and chad and I were both reminded of Vegas when we sat down. Our server, Jonathan, was wonderful. Funny and attentive without being intrusive. We both had the bruschetta samplers to start and chad really enjoyed it but to be honest I was less than impressed. I mean, I ate it all and it was by no means bad, I just didn't love it. The bread wasn't crispy as is customary with bruschetta, it was just cold, but I just assumed this is how it's done here. Also I had no idea what I was eating. I should have held onto the paper. For entrees, chad had the filet and I had the lobster and shrimp ravioli. Chads filet was wonderful, even though he omitted the Gorgonzola cheese. Cooked to perfection and tasted fresh. I thoroughly enjoyed my pasta dish. And it was huge! Once again we both gobbled our entire meal right up. On board for dessert was a creme brûlée for me and caramel cheesecake for chad. Once again those were gone in a matter on minutes. 
Brio really has the feel of a grand ballroom and I enjoyed the atmosphere immensely. Overall the food was good and tasted fresh, which isn't often the case with Italian food. Even the bread at the beginning of the meal was good. And for restaurant week they offered a glass of house wine with the meal that was a nice added, and appreciated, touch. However, no Vegas style Italian restaurant would be complete without a little bit of tacky. The paper on top of the table clothes? Saves on laundering costs I supposed. And the way the plates say \"brio!\" across the top...? Just in case we forgot where we were. 
I would definitely come back again for restaurant week or some other offer, but I honestly can't see myself going out of my way to come here. Good experience but nothing super special."}
{"text":"I'll start off with a positive. The food! First time getting lunch at Brio, I got the kid's portion chicken with mashed potatoes. Well seasoned chicken, amazing mashed potatoes.

Unfortunately, that is where the positive ends. Customer service, mostly on the order ahead/pick-up end, needs improvement. Personally working in the customer service industry, it is my passion to give each and every customer a great experience, and leave smiling. There were several issues, from 'uh-huh's' and eye rolling, to taking 10 minutes to print my receipt. Picking up the food ate 15 minutes into my lunch break. I didn't feel as though the hostess or manager on duty cared to hear my concerns, and suggestions. I would recommend a moral booster for the team! Because the food is delicious, but because of the service, it is unlikely I will be a returning customer.


From,

A hungry college student who just likes smaller portions (hence the kid's meal)"}
{"text":"I must say this is one of my favorite happy hour places. It starts from 3pn to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Thursday. There are a lot of appetizers and drinks on the happy hour menu. My favorite one is the Beef Carpaccio, and the eggplant shrimp. The drinks on the happy hour menu were decent and I think it's a little diluted on the alcohol. If you want to check out this place try to come early as it tends to get pretty packed during about five or six mark."}
{"text":"Nice environment, clean establishment.

Wouldn't recommend for food. 
They don't accomodate vegans very well.  
Food has no Wow factor to make it stand out for the prices. 

Go to the Bootlegger bistro up the street another 5mins or panevino.

Sorry brio. I only come here to sit out side really.  Happy hour is OK."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar last night at Brio and it was wonderful! The two bartenders Marian and Brenden were the perfect hosts!! They were friendly and beyond helpful in deciding on what to eat! Thank you so much for taking such good care of us. We are most definitely coming back to Brio of Scottsdale!!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night and MAN! Is this place worth yelping over or what. First of all, great ambiance, great location. 

The menu had lots of choices and was very busy. We were on our way to the airport and told out waiter that we were kind of in a rush. He punched in our food and it came out I would say within ten minutes. I was extremely impressed.

Not only did the food come out timely and our server was very attentive, but the food was DELICIOUS! I had the Tuscan Harvest Salad and it was so delicious. It had chicken, bacon, dried cranberries, fresh apples, and a nice vinaigrette to top it along with other things that I can't remember.

For the price, this restaurant exceeded my expectations and I will DEFINITELY be coming back!"}
{"text":"Chef John and Server Samantha,  treated us like Kings and Queens.  The entrees were scrumptious. 
Chef John even created a Scampi dish for our 
young diner."}
{"text":"Really pretty interior! It was all decorated for Christmas when I went today.

I went with a friend because we were in the Scottsdale Quarter and were craving bread. We went in around 4:30 and it was pretty slow (awkward time). We got a bread basket and it had a half loaf of white bread and some crispy flax/rosemary crackers. The bread loaf was warm and good to satisfy our craving. It wasn't crusty bread, but it was good enough. We asked were oil and vinegar and they brought it out promptly!

We ordered the Strawberry Balsamic salad ($15) to split. It was good, but standard. Came with strawberries, gorgonzola cheese, balsamic dressing, grapes, and candied pecans. Definitely overpriced, but it's all we ordered so whatever. Service was good, we had Ethan.

Might go back for happy hour, but it probably won't be my first choice restaurant--more of an \"in the area so it's convenient\" type."}
{"text":"Brio Tuscan Grille is located in a very random shopping area that is a little further away from the strip. If I wasn't going to dinner with my family I probably wouldn't have come here. It is just too out of the way, especially if you don't have a car or you would rather go wild. This is not the place for you. The patrons who come here are mostly an older crowd or families, so this is not a party spot.

The food here isn't too bad. It isn't gourmet, but it isn't trash. We ended up ordering the Pasta Pesto (Angel hair, grilled chicken, caramelized onions, spinach, tomatoes, red peppers, Feta, basil, light pesto sauce) and the Fettuccine Rustica (Fresh egg pasta, spicy marinara, capers, basil, Kalamata olives, Parmesan). They were both just ok, nothing special. A little on the bland side.

Overall, I would probably try this place again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I have been to this Brio a few times and everything is always great!  I am a huge fan of the lasagna.  The different sauces really sets it off!  The service is great too.  Great food + great service = 5 stars!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love the brunch here! The stuffed French toast is sensational and they have a variety of delicious cocktails like sangria and bellinis. We always enjoy sitting outside. Sometimes they bring the kids a little plate of pizza dough to play with, which keeps them entertained until the food arrives, and they'll even bake it if you choose. We've gone back many times and have always had great service!"}
{"text":"First impression was that this was going to be a great meal. I was right! Our server was Tamara and she was excellent,in fact everyone who worked here was outstanding. The food was fresh and served as it should be. Tasty,hot, promptly delivered in order not ahead and not too slow. Tamara went out of her way to see that our meal was excellent and it was appreciated in my tip. They also have the best tasting flat bread to nibble on while you wait for appetizers and main course. To my shock I discovered that this is actually part of a chain. This is the best chain I have ever eaten at for Italian food. The impression was more like a fine dining experience in beverly hills or pasadena. I think that they have an incredible future if they stick to this formula. Meticulous attention to detail and of course great tasting food. I will definitely be back as I live in summerlin and I discovered they have a place at tivoli."}
{"text":"Good solid establishment. Friendly, good serve, clean. Lovely outdoor seating.

Our server, Ashley, was friendly and competent. 

Thanks, Brio!"}
{"text":"Town Square is always a fun choice. Brio has a lot of options and whether dining at the bar or dining room you can't go wrong. 

One of the better happy hours in town square and the reverse is even better. When the weather is great sit outside and people watch!!"}
{"text":"Brio reached out to me to come back to make up what happened last time back in February.  We haven't been back to Brio since Valentine's Day.  We normally go here once or twice a month before Valentine's incident.  Service here has changed from what it was years ago.  It's always a hit or miss.  We tend to spend about an hour to an hour and a half here, depending on how the service is and how busy they are. 

We came on last Wednesday night with the same couple we went on Valentine's Day.  I didn't tell them we were invited back.  We all weren't too hungry this time around and only ordered 3 glasses of wine and an entree each.  I did have a gnat in my glass of wine.  They replaced it right away.  Service was much better this time from the hostess to our server.  I added one of my friend to the dinner and asked the hostess to tell our server to hand me the check at the end, so I can pay for the bill and tip properly on what was being taken care of.  We didn't order so much food and drinks, maybe this is why they took care of our visit.

I really do appreciate the kind gesture from the management.  After being a loyal customer of Brio since 2010...  Either this location have to get better in customer service or we'll have to suffer through the service.  LOL"}
{"text":"Great service by our server.  Calamari was off today.  Spicy Shrimp Bruschetta description much better than actual item. Chopped salad great and fresh! Pasta alla vodka was very tasty."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  From the crusty fresh hot bread to the yummy desserts, Brio is the best.  Our waiter, Danny, was phenomenal - great attitude, super customer service, very attentive and professional.  It was the perfect evening to sit outside, sip a cocktail, people watch and enjoy a good meal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here on a tuesday night with a group of 4 after one member of our party declared she'd been burned out on spicy food, and required some pasta. It was 9:30 at night, we didn't want to spend $32 a plate on the strip, and so we decided to give long passed-by Brio a try.

The verdict; upscale olive garden that knows what Al Dente means. So 3 stars at least for that. We had hoped to sit outside, but after putting our names in for a table, got so quickly ushered to a seat next to the miniature Colosseum replica (?!...Why would you build that?!) that we sort of gave up on asking.  Very much has the same \"upscale chain that doesn't want to be considered a chain\" vibe as a Yardhouse or a McCormick and Shmick's. 

There was absolutely nothing wrong with the food. We had a calamari appetizer, 2 basil gimlets, a lemonade, 3 pasta dishes and a salad. We might have all been really hungry, but we also finished everything, and then nibbled at some of the crumbs. I actually wish they would have offered a refill on the bread, as my jerk tablemates ate all the french, and left me the crackers, but this offer was not forthcoming. That was sort of the modus opperandi. Nothing extra or surprising or special, no extras extended. You get what you ask for, you pay for what you ask for. Nothing wrong with that, just nothing to get super excited about, either. 

I had the sausage and tomato pasta, which was good; the pasta actually had flavor and texture, which I had hoped for but not expected. The tomatoes were actually fresh and the fennel sausage a bit on the dry side, but crispy and very flavorful. I ate the whole thing and enjoyed it. I just doubt I'll remember anything about it a month from now. 

Brio seems like a very safe bet; I'm sure if I went back in 6 months I would have a very similar experience. It would be a great place to take my utterly unadventurous friends and relatives when they visit from out of town. If I was still doing the dating thing and on a blind date, had to do a working lunch, or meet an estranged relative I knew nothing about, this might be a good place to avoid judgments."}
{"text":"We came in with less than an hour of closing- the lady who seated us was professional and very kind! Bread was at our table quickly from when we sat. Our waiter, a guy with some cool funky hair, was wonderful! He got our apps and dinner to us quick. The eggplant and shrimp- so delicious the shrimp is seasoned perfectly, and I don't even like shrimp that much. The lobster bisque- my boyfriend loved it so much. Not disappointed at all. I got a chicken and angel hair pasta dish- I'm kinda a snub when it comes to pasta, but there was nothing to complain about! My boyfriend got the crab cakes- the veggies were pretty salty but the cakes great! We got mini cheesecakes to go we didn't want the staff to have to wait on us past closing: not really fair. My only complaint about dinner is that our table wasn't cleaned off completely. But will be returning again."}

For appetizers Calamari C-, artichoke dip- B, caprese salad B.

Lobster tail TINY and DRY.  , vodka pasta- B+, pesto fettuccine-F. No pesto to speak of, flavor blahhhhh. 
Sides were ok at best. 
Won't be back"}
{"text":"WooHoo! As good as it gets!  That's an understatement!

This place is a triple threat.  The decor is warm and relaxing, the service was great, and the food was spectacular!

We enjoyed the bruschetta for our appetizer.  The various flavors were great and the balsamic vinegar glaze couldn't be more flavorful.  

For dinner, I had the gorgonzola crusted lamb cutlets.  AMAZING!!

You cant have that good of a meal and not indulge in a little dessert.  The creme brule  and terramassu were awesome.  

It takes a lot to wow me but this place came through!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at both locations in Las Vegas and they're both excellent.

Pros: Food is always great. I've never had a single bad dish and tried many. Lasagna is my absolute favorite and it's smothered in cheese, it's incredible. Drinks are always good and if you sit on the patios you get great views at either location.

Cons: None, place is pretty great

I will definitely continue eating here as often as possible"}
{"text":"Great family friendly menu and very helpful wait staff.  The portions are very large, even on the kids menu!  We hit this place on the way out from Vegas back to LA and were very happy with the food and service.  At first we were not sure it would be a good place to take our 2 year old but everything was great!  I had the red fish with potatoes (daily special) my wife had the mushroom raviolli and our daughter had the pizza (of course!)
The food seemed thoughtfully prepared and fresh.  The atmosphere was great for lunch and it was not overly crowded.  Our waitress was VERY attentive and our glasses were never empty.  
I would definitely revisit Brio and recommend it to anyone looking at Brio as a possibility!"}
{"text":"Came here on Father's day at 5PM. It was a pretty full. The decor is very nice, reminds me of typical Cheesecake factory. The main dining room is a little loud, fortunately we got to sit in a round room in the back of the restaurant that was very nice and quite a bit quieter so that a normal conversation could be had. I ordered the espresso ribeye steak with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus. The steak was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was mild. It was Very good. I tried a few of my neighbors dishes, cod over angel hair with lemon caper sauce, and Brio pasta. They were all pretty good but I felt I made the BEST choice. Most of their dishes range in the $20-30. The sourdough bread is warm and crusty. delicious."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, the decor was very nice. The staff was very friendly. And the food was great. I loved the flat bread and bread loaf they brought to the table. Bruschetta Quattro appetizer was really good. I had the Pasta Pesto, but asked if I could have some alfredo sauce on the side. They obliged me on that. It's definitely a place to go for a special occasion. And we definitely go back."}
{"text":"I just love Brio....they are very consistent. I can always count on Brio to serve me up some tasty vittles when I'm hungry for some good Italian fare"}
{"text":"Well the food is good the service staff leaves a lot to be desired. I work in the plaza, was looking to have lunch. Because it was just 1 person I was asked to sit in the bar I wasn't offered a table outside. Basically turned away


Update the manager contacted me, I've tried them a couple of times and the service and food has been outstanding"}
{"text":"LOVED THIS PLACE! My girlfriend and I were really bored one night and were driving around and just spontaneously decided to come here for dinner... 

We were seated right away and we were able to pick our table we wanted outside. They were very nice and accommodating. Our waiter he was really nice however I think he was a little overwhelmed that night.. we got forgotten about a couple times, but seriously the food made up for it 100 percent. 

I ordered a Mango Sangria and ohh let me tell you how tasty that was! Best Sangria I think I have ever had. 

Definitely worth checking out. For a chain this place was awesome. The food was outstanding our calamari was cooked perfectly.. I hate when it comes out rubbery. Their caesar salad is so amazing as well as their Pepperoni and Sausage Flatbread... just writing this review is making me crave the flatbread again.."}
{"text":"We went to Brio for the first time to celebrate an anniversary. The hotess sat us at an intimate table. When we arrived to the table there was a card waiting to congratulate us. The atmosphere and decor was great. The server seemed a bit overwhelmed at times, but the meal and sangria were delicious. At the end, the server surprised us with a cheesecake with two candles. It was a great evening!"}
{"text":"WINNER, WINNER, NO BRIO FOR DINNER!!!

Ok, here's the overview: Brio is one of those swanky, but casual kind of joints...A businessman in an Armani suit may be sitting across from a college kid wearing a t-shirt and flip-flops. The interior kind of has a Cheesecake Factory meets Bellagio feel to it. The average dinner runs $18-20.

So here's what I liked: Brio has hands-down the best after-dinner mints in a jar near the front enterence. Don't feel intimidated sticking your hand in the jar because the hostess is staring you down, heck, they're free...take advantage.

Now, here's the dirty: The last two times I went here (about 2 months apart), I had chicken dishes, both of which were undercooked. The first dish a couple months ago was grossly undercooked and had a very cool pink center. My most recent chicken dinner was just slightly undercooked...but pink enough to complain, nonetheless...Total gross-out!!

What sealed the deal for me to never go back is the manager telling me the reason my most recent dish was pink is that Brio brines the chicken for 48 hours!! Are you kidding me? Ok, I know that when you brine chicken it will turn a little pink. However, the time factor now becomes the problem. 48 hours will darn near cook it (chicken ceviche)...not to mention give you a stroke.

I'm not sure what to think...Brio was quickly becoming my favorite Italian restaurant in the East Valley, but these two most recent visits have got me looking for alternatives!! I am also a little bitter they stopped selling canoli's.

Recommendation: Want to impress your date, but don't have a lot of loot? Load up on Brio's free dinner bread and water and get the hell out of there. The sourdough bread is pretty tasty and the herbed cracker's (yet while messy) taste high-quality. Before actually order dinner and spend your hard earned money here, have an instant recollection about someone you know who almost got salmonella from eating raw chicken there...twice.

Recommendation #2: While Brio doesn't offer wi-fi, there is an open wi-fi connection (with a strong signal) from one of the restaurants near-by...I won't mention the name of that business, but I found you get the strongest signal if you sit to the west side of the building. :P"}
{"text":"I think at this point I may not check in but I have been going into Brio for quite some time now and I have to say the service here is phenomenal! The food is also just as amazing as the staff! The atmosphere at this location is awesome I prefer it over the other location on Rampart. Always come here with my mom. Definitely a hot spot! 

Kai....just go see him! He makes THE BEST cappuccino! and you'll receive the best customer service from him! :D He checks in at the right times, he makes an effort to suggest other items on the menu. It is nice to see servers know their menu and can suggest other options to explore as well. Great job! :)"}
{"text":"I have eaten hear previously and the food was good except for the last two times. 

We had reservations for dinner as it was Mother's Day. Our waiter was great . Appetizers were good we had brochette sampler . We ordered two orders of the fettuccine with shrimp and lobster and shrimp and lobster risotto. Also the six ounce filet. 
The Pasta in one of the entree's had been left sitting and was cold and rubbery looking ,as the person eating it is a manager in a restaurant she was not happy.The lobster in all three pasta dishes was mushy . Therefore none of us ate the pasta. Mothers day dinner was bread and appetizers. The steak was also burnt. 
The manager took all off the pasta dishes and apologized but that did not make up for not having  dinner."}
{"text":"I have dined with Brio Tuscan Grill in the past, but this time felt compelled to review.

I arrived at Brio Tuscan Grille  just before noon on a Friday and to my surprise did not wait to be seated - the restaurant, albeit busy, provided immediate space.  The restaurant is that of a large, open floor, high ceiling dining space.  The \"Tuscan\" décor is immediately apparent and the high ceiling with streaming tapestry is a nice touch.  Regretfully I felt as though I spent the entire meal yelling at my colleague as the roar of the patrons is stifling.  The dining room rumbles with dialogue from the tables, each seemingly attempting to talk louder than the next.  This may be the result of the large dome-like space.

The team serving us was friendly, not unlike the hosts, but did unfortunately need to be reminded of extra table flatware, indications for drink refills, and simple things like a spoon to stir my coffee, however, negating these oversights with accommodating pleasant demeanor.

I cannot speak on my friend, but I ordered the Mezza Chicken Limone and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys characteristic chicken.  Aside from the elegant name, this lunch fare is simply Lemon Chicken with Campanelle Florentine.  The chicken was flavorful, with lemon obvious with each bite, and the bed of greens accented the capers nicely; the portion size is perfect for a healthy lunch as well.  I would also like to note the Campanelle Florentine was just a bit overcooked, but not enough for most to notice.  Again, I recommend the Mezza Chicken Limone and Brio Tuscan Grille to all - we'll see how things are next time: at dinner."}
{"text":"We went to Brio at Tivoli Village last night to celebrate my father in law's 60th birthday. I wish I could remember our server's name because she made the night (white, dark blonde hair pulled back, funny)! 

The food was great. 2 of us got the gargonzola crusted beef medallions. YUM! One got tortellini and one got the gargonzola crusted lamb chops. We also had calamari and caesar salads for appetizers. All food was great. We had cocktails and then got a bottle of wine. The wine selection never disappoints. Toward the end of dinner, they brought out creme brulee with a candle for the bday boy which was nice. The table ordered dessert drinks (I had an amazing port wine!). 

So why only 3 stars? We loved the service and the food. The problem was the fire alarm. It went off not once but twice during dinner. So loud thay everyone was plugging their ears. Strobe lights flashing. It took a very long time for it to stop each time. I understand that this might be out of the restaurants control, but they could have done something to appease the few tables of people in the restaurant. After the first alarm, a manager walked around apologizing. After the second, nothing. There weren't many people in the restaurant at 9:30 so it would have been a nice gesture to at least offer a drink on the house or something. No more apologies or compensation. It just seems a little unprofessional when we're spending $300 and had to sit through alarms twice. 

If you can go and avoid the alarm (or don't mind them not caring if it ruins your dinner), everything else is great!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! It's my husband & I go-to place on our date nites. The food is delish, the ambiance is nice. Alittle loud for ur typical \"date-nite\" setting but u can have a normal conversation w/o yelling. Service is great & quick. The wait staff know the menu and will help u choose if ur stuck, regardless of what u end up with u won't be upset! My hubby fav is Tomatoe Caprese and I get the beef carpaccio as our 1st sides always! 
Ty Brio!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Brio was very quick to respond to my post and stated a member of management would contact me. I then received an email from William and we spoke about my experience.  He was extremely apologetic and concerned about my experience.  I provided the details of my visit and again he was very apologetic.

I am very happy that Brio reached out and responded with an apology.

Thank you to William and Brio for listening to my experience and apologizing."}
{"text":"I think who your server is can make or break your view on this place...I've been here numerous times and always in the dining room and had exceptional service...My friends and I went there last night for a birthday celebration and sat in the bar for happy hour- which the prices are fabulous for that! Our server was ok at the beginning but as the evening went on the service went way down hill- we didn't see our waitress for big chunks of time and had to wave her down to ask about the free dessert my friend should have gotten for her birthday and after we paid our bill, we never saw her again- which turns out was at least 45 minutes!! We even had a friend join late and she never asked if she wanted anything- dumb move since I would have ordered another drink and my friend wanted food- Note to servers: If people are going to take up space in a booth anyway, sell them food and drinks at every turn, bigger bills means bigger tips ;)"}
{"text":"After a horrid experience moments before at a nearby restaurant, it has felt good to relax and enjoy a nice meal here. Eating outdoors with misters keeping things cool, pleasant music, and wait staff who knows the difference between hovering and serving, very very nice.

Disappointed in the chicken (too dry), but everything else was great. No wine cooler on the menu, but that didn't stop them from serving that when I asked.

Bread is top notch, worth the price of admission.

No dessert this time, maybe next.

Server's name: Trevor."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location before and it was always ok.  This last time I dined the service was terrible and the food even worse!  We couldn't get anyone to give us refills on our water.  The steak salads were missing the tomatoes and candied pecans and just didn't taste right.  It was rather disappointing after dining here in the past then having this experience.  We usually go to the location in Tivolti Village and will continue to go there as the service is excellent and the food amazing!"}
{"text":"I like this restaurant! Come here every time I'm in Scottsdale. I like the food and the prices!"}
{"text":"First time coming to Brio, and don't think I'll be recommending it to anyone. Food was really mediocre. Felt kinda sick by the end of it because my braised short rib just didn't taste good or outstanding in any way. 

Strawberry lemonade was decent. If I could rate the atmosphere, I'd give it a shrug out of 5. Just a shrug."}
{"text":"Great Restaurant! I went with some friends and tried the brucshetta sampler! awesome!. 
I had the lobster and crab meat ravioli. Was delicious. Very classy place and nice decor. a dress up place for sure. I would recommend this place for a special occasion for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! 

If I do return, I'll be wearing DEET.  If you're going to leave the front door open, you need to deal with the damn gnats.

{"text":"Had to pick up some walking shoes for our upcoming trip, so we decided after seeing this urban style mall several months ago to check it out, that way we wouldn't have to drive to N Scottsdale for the Ecco store.  After our 1.5 hr drive into the valley we were starving and as we approached the San Tan mall we thought maybe there might be a non-chain we could get a bite at.  Well this is totally a chain mall with not one independent anything.  So it was between the Mexican or Italian chain.  We opted for Brio, thinking we could get a panini or such for lunch.  It was an early weekday and they were slow.  Opted to sit on the patio, which was on the N side, so it was a little shady.  Why don't these places plan better when in development and put the patio on the E and S sides of the building.  Okay my designer fundamentals are showing.  We quickly perused the menu and say they had a lunch special of several items, opted for the pizza and a chicken/portobello pasta, both $7.95.  I thought at that price I won't mind that it isn't great.  The server brought out some bread and Italian herbed crispy flat bread that I really liked.  A short while later the manager came over and told me they had made my pizza incorrectly and they were remaking it and it would take a bit longer.  I was pleased of the fact that they notified me and I wasn't just left wondering what is taking so long.  The food arrived and I must say I was impressed.  The crust on the pizza was slightly sweet, baked perfectly and the toppings added nice flavor to the crust without overwhelming it.  The pasta dish featured their homemade marinara, which was chunky with fresh roma tomatoes and lots of oregano.  Paired nicely with the grilled chicken breast/portobello smothered in melted provolone.  Surprisingly a great priced lunch in a chain within a chain mall.  A first for me!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant few weeks ago.  The food was great including the desserts.  The service was very good."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since it opened, with good memories of one of their locations in OH from years ago.  Good service, with experienced waitstaff that recover from gaffes easily (such as not knowing their own drink menu during dinner service).  First time I had the shrimp and scallop risotto, which was poorly executed to say the least: rice was still overly al dente, sauce was thin and overall just needed a bit more TLC and it could have been good.  The second time I had the shrimp and lobster pasta, and putting aside the miniscule amount of lobster present (two small chunks for a very large pasta portion) the pasta was fresh made and done well and properly sauced.  For apps I have tried the carpaccio (not dressed with any olive oil or lemon and cooked) and the fried calamari which was passable, but not even to the standard of Cheesecake factory.  Finally, most things have been heavily seasoned.  All in all, I will probably end up giving them one more shot"}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance.  Very good service and delicious food.  The menu is extensive.  I can always find items I'd like to try.  It has a resort atmosphere with the high ceilings and lush decor.  It's definitely a place to bring someone for a special event.  There is a happy hour but I've never been there during that time."}
{"text":"Oh Brio's HAPPY HOUR is probably one of my top HH places! You can not beat their $3.95 appetizers and $5 drinks! Well actually before their apps were only $2.95 but hey it's only a $1 increase.. I can handle that! Haha my must haves when I go are the beef carpaccio & spinach artichoke dip! My man and I usually share the burger as well.. The sucky part about this place would be that you can never tell if you're going to be able to get a spot or not.. The best place to sit is inside in one of the booths or outside by the firepit if you have a big group but it can get pretty busy.  ... Boo! But hey what can you do..!?

{"text":"I've gone to Brio a lot but just never gott around to writing a review.  Lunch here get's so crazy that I rarely go, but I was meeting some ladies for a little early for a business meeting so we decided to go here.  They had already gotten a table when I got there so there wasn't a wait.  However, there were only two place settings at the table and our server never even offered to bring me one or a menu or anything once I sat.

We ordered our lunches and still no place setting.  When our food came I had to ask for silverware, which he brought, but no napkin, which I had to ask for so he finally brought it.  I had ordered the steak medium rare and it was medium.  I ate it anyway and didn't complain since I wasn't paying for lunch and I knew these ladies were in a hurry.

If I had to rate Brio on all my visits together, I'd give it 4 stars, but based on this last visit alone I have to be honest and say it was only a 3-star visit."}

{"text":"I want to start off by saying my wife and I love brio. We usually come about 6-8 times a year and even did our rehearsal dinner for our wedding here. We got seated right away, 4 total in the party, and for about 10-15 mins no waiter or anyone noticed us or said anything until I finally asked a bus boy to grab her. Not a good start but whatever, the service was bad for brio standards tonight, at least she was friendly. 

So the good, the reason we come. The food was great. We had calamri and sausage pepperoni pizza to start. Great. I got the lobster bisque and as always great. For dinner I had lamb, great!!, my wife had rissoito, pretty good, my friend had shrimp Vodak pasta, very good and his girlfriend had steak salad, which she enjoyed. For dessert we split tiramisu and creme breleu, both very good. Overall great meal and mediocre service. Will come back as the service is usually much better than today."}
{"text":"I visited this place during happy hour and it is one of the best in the area! The happy hour goes from 3:30-6:30pm and it includes a selection of drinks and food. The wine glass is $5 and it was good to see that they offer more than just the house wine during the happy hour. 

The food is simply amazing! I ordered the crispy shrimp (spicy Remoulade, green onions), the margherita dip (four cheese blend, tomato compote, Reggiano, basil, grilled ciabatta) and the black pepper shrimp (romano crusted eggplant, spicy black pepper cream sauce). All three of these dishes were delicious. I would order all three again. 

When I visited this restaurant it was a Thursday afternoon. The place was really full and it was difficult to find a table (even at the bar!). Because of how busy it was it was sometimes difficult to get our waitress attention in order to place an order. Even though she was swamped with work she was very friendly. 

This is a place I am def coming back. Thank you for the awesome food!r"}

{"text":"I ordered a salmon dish and a glass of great wine to pair. The waiter seemed new but I liked that they had the lighter calorie menu to choose from. You don't typically get that from an Italian style menu.

The prices aren't cheap, but I felt that my $37 for meal and wine was reasonable.

Good for groups."}
{"text":"Great service ( Anna) and great food! We had the flatbread  for appetizers and with a party of 6 had a variety of entrees.  I had braised short ribs with Brussel sprouts ( no pecans - I'm allergic)and polenta.  Others at the table had salmon, crab cakes , lasagna, chicken Caesar salad and shrimp alfredo."}
{"text":"We love Brio and come here pretty often for good food. Tonight we had the usual spicy shrimp eggplant, as always it was spot on. We also tried the sausage ricotta flat bread, was pretty good. My husband ordered the sausage tomato pasta, spicier than it looked. All in all the food was good. Would be giving 5 stars but our service was a bit slow. All of us were very thirsty and our server seemed annoyed that I wanted her to take down our visit credit. So that was a bummer for one of our favorite places to eat."}

Lasagna which I must say was The Best
my discerning palate has ever enjoyed.
My 3 guests also enjoyed their selections as well....and only left the design on their plates uneaten.
The prices are a little bit higher but well worth the quality and quantity proved.
Try it I'm sure you will enjoy it as well."}
{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and I had one of the best dining experiences we've ever had. Craig B. was just brilliant. From the moment we sat down, he was so friendly and personable. We had never been to Brio before, so he explained the menu to us and answered my (many) questions. Craig was very attentive and went above and beyond to make our experience memorable. He even brought over complimentary tiramisu for the both of us, which was delicious. I had the Vodka pasta and my boyfriend had the lasagna, both were absolutely amazing. My favorite part of the evening, besides the wonderful server, was the atmosphere of the restaurant. There are lights strung in the trees and you really feel at home. Coming from a couple who dines out frequently, please don't hesitate to visit Brio in Town Square, you won't regret it. And ask for Craig, I cannot put into words just how wonderful he really was."}
{"text":"Went a while back for a little birthday dinner and order the mushroom ravioli. So delicious I cleaned the plate! The servers and bussers were friendly and helpful without interrupting too much and even turned on the heaters outside and set it up real close to us because it was cold out that night. Much appreciated. We got the dessert sampler and all three were so good, especially the creme brûlée. Definitely a nice spot for dinner that doesn't have to break the bank."}
{"text":"The happy hour is awesome! Great price for awesome food.  My boyfriend and I were just running errands at the apple store and we stumbled upon this amazing italian resturant.  We decided to sit at the bar during happy hour.  We ordered eggplant fries, beef carpaccio, and a burger. 

eggplant fries- breaded and comes with a yummy garlic aioli 

beef carpaccio- really yummy.. super thinly sliced beef with fresh arugula

burger- we were pretty blown away by how good this burger was.  Great price for great quality!

We will be back to try more items on the menu :)"}
{"text":"I gave them 3 stars because I couldn't believe that ordering a burger and didn't want lettuce and tomato on there they said they couldn't do it that way. They had to put it on there. WTH."}
{"text":"I don't want to give this place 1 star but after last night I have to. I've eaten here many times and it's always so good and the service is good. I made a reservation for 8:30, checked in with the hostess and she said we would be seated soon. Unfortunately we sat there for 45 minutes past our reservation time. Not happy with that at all. 

The only explanation we were given was that they were running behind because it was Valentine's Day! Well obviously that's why I made a reservation. Maybe you shouldn't double book your reservations so you can seat people that expect to be seated on their specified time.

Disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Update (5/19/2008)

For my original review, see below.  However, an update and upgrade in rating is called for.  After submitting my complaint to Brio's management, they took exceptionally thorough remedial measures to correct the issues I had.  They talked to the waiter and offered a discount on my next meal.  I understand that screwups happen, but when a restaurant takes the effort to mitigate the poor experience, that's worth a lot to me.  It means the restaurant does care about your dining experience.  The management staff was very attentive to my concerns and I would go back to give them a second chance. :)

(Prior Review)

For 75 dollars for a group of three, this place is was a major disappointment.  The decor is nice with vaulted ceilings.  The ambiance is loud but acceptable.  The problems with this place are significant.  I can recommend the carbonara since it was the only dish that was properly seasoned.  My two associates ordered the lobster risotto and veal scallopini.  Both dishes were sent back for being underseasoned.  The risotto was overcooked and thereby mushy with only a hint of lobster taste.  The scallopini was so underseasoned that my associate had to cover it in vegetables to give it some flavor.  The service was equally disappointing.  Our bill was mixed up with another table.  If I didn't check the receipt, I would have overpaid.  I informed the waiter who corrected the mistake.  However, when I asked for the receipt showing the prior charge was voided, he argued that the receipt was fixed.  I think he was too busy trying to argue with me that he wasn't listening to what I was asking for.  He then blamed me for not being clear.  Holy crap.  Are you serious?!  I left a 4 dollar tip only because leaving ZERO is reserved for particularly egregious service but this case came close."}
{"text":"My Hubby and family and friends take me out to Vegas for my birthday and I have to say this one was the best place I have ever been. I loved the atmosphere and the food was so good the service was top notch. You start off with salad bar lobster bisque and they have sushi too. The waiters come round with all sorts of meats and sliced right at ur table and all the varieties of the meats I can't count em all... However my favorite was bacon wrapped filet mignon . I even had a birthday cheese cake and everyone sang to me. I highly recommend you try this place when out in Vegas . I will be coming again and I'm bringing my kids. What an experience ."}

Pasta alla vodka (taste was as expected, but pasta was overcooked)
Sourdough bread (normal)

{"text":"First time here at this restaurant & I will be coming back. Awesome experience. Awesome customer service & they have a beautiful clean establishment. Lovely staff. Kai was my server & he was amazing. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My guests and I were seated and we asked for bread, as one couple had just gotten off a plane and they  were starved.  We got it 20 minutes later after asking 3 more times and threatening to leave.

The Calamari appetizer was the worst ever.  50% of the plate (not exagearting) was old breading, and the calamari was tough and overcooked.

I ordered the Shrimp Risotto, which used to come with shrimp and scallops.   No more scallops.  But of course they raised the price on the dish anyway.   Welcome to new American dining.   Cut the food.  Raise the prices.

Brio presents a nice atmosphere because it was physically well designed.  Problem is, they forgot to hire anyone who can cook or provide nice table service."}
{"text":"Pretty good italian chain restaurant. The outdoor seating at this location is really nice."}
{"text":"Got to try this place because while in Vegas - we met up with family and they recommended this place to meet up and I am SO GLAD they did!

I had their Brio Sliced Steak Salad - This was SO GOOD and I LOVED it.  The salad had tender slices of steak with a chopped salad that had a delicious balsamic dressing along with tomatoes, gargonzola, mushrooms, spicy pecans and I think there was a bit of creamy horseradish that gave it that perfect BITE with the steak!! Wish they had this dish at home! 

We also had the special which was the Seared Scallops with Risotto - I think my hubby pretty much inhaled this dish and the plate licked clean!  Other family members had the Lobster and Risotto!  The TAIL was HUGE - they LOVED it and each of the risottos were paired with wine which went perfectly with each of the dishes!

We were so stuffed we couldn't eat dessert but i have to tell you - the food, service, atmosphere was PERFECT! We sat around and enjoyed our meal and company with water glasses getting filled and just great service all around.

I actually wish we had a Brio Tuscan Grille in the bay area but at least now we know a go to place when in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Just had our anniversary dinner at Brio with our family..,in one word, FABULOUS!  This was not our first time dining here , and as usual, it was not a disappointment! Three of us in our party had the Chicken Marsala and one had Pasta Brio.  The Chicken Marsala was tender, large size portion, Marsala sauce was flavorful and good consistency, plus they don't scrimp on the mushrooms. The asparagus was seasoned to perfection and cooked perfectly, as well. We all had Caesar salads that were fresh and with a great tasting Caesar dressing ! The Pasta Brio was also a huge hit... rigatoni with grilled chicken, and seared mushrooms , in a roasted red pepper vodka sauce! Just a winner of a night all the way around! Fantastic dinner, outstanding service, beautiful ambiance,  and lovely company to enjoy it all with!  Anytime you want to awaken your taste buds with a flavor-bursting meal, Brio is definitely the place to go! :)"}
{"text":"My first visit here by recommendation and oohhh why oohh why don't you have a location near my home?? 

I had the medallions encrusted in artichokes, fresh grilled veggies and yummy mashed taters. I most often alter my mashed but these were so buttery and creamy they didn't even need salt. 

My boyfriend had one of the specials for the day. Grilled yellowtail with mashed taters and grilled asparagus. The fish was grilled just perfect and the seasoning was very good. 

We also had their signature bruchetta which I am still dreaming about and trying to figure out a way to make it myself since they are not local to me. 

I also here they have a great Happy Hour but e were here on a Saturday s we did not partake."}
{"text":"Town Square is the place to be for happy hour!  With so many choices - Brio Tuscan Grille is a great place to get your grub on for cheap!

Their Tuscan Taster Menu is available in the bar area only and runs
Monday through Friday: 3 pm to 6 pm
Sunday through Thursday: 9 pm to close

All nine of their mouthwatering items are only $2.95!!  What a steal!

* Braised Meatballs & Creamy Polenta \"Topped with Marsala tomato sauce, Reggiano and parsley.\" - Three generous sized meatballs in a tasty and tangy sauce.  The polenta is a minimal amount the covers the bottom of the dish, but a nice touch.  The Husband really enjoyed this and was about to get another!

* Beef Carpaccio \"Served with field greens, capers, mustard aioli and shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\" - Our favorite of the ones we tried, so we got two orders.  So good and tasty, and the field greens are a nice complement to the dish.

* Margherita Flatbread \"Fresh Mozzarella, vine-ripened tomatoes and fresh basil.\" - Very basic flatbread pizza, no fancy frills here.  A nice simple crunch.

* Sliced Steak Bruschetta \"With Gorgonzola Dolce, arugula, fennel, charred tomato, shaved Parmesan and Tuscan Italian dressing.\" - Four slices of bruschetta makes this a hearty dish with the cheese and beef.  Good flavors though and sauce adds a nice sweetness.

Unfortunately, their happy hour only extends to the food so there are no drink specials.  (When I called, whomever answered said there were drink specials but it wasn't so when we sat down.)  

The bartenders took our food and drink orders, and the food came out promptly.  We had no issues with service as a result unlike the other reviewers.

Overall, it's a nice place and we enjoyed ourselves here.  The dining room looks like a grand hall with all the drapery.  I suggest getting your grub on here and getting drunk somewhere else if you want to save a few bucks.

Update! 07/15/09 - Went back again last Friday and finished off the entire Tuscan Tasters menu.

* Brio Burger \"A quartet of BRIO's famous Bistecca Burgers, with smoked Mozzarella and housemade chips.\" - A very decent size burger for three bucks that was tasty and cut into four, perfect for sharing.  Chips were yummy too!

* Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant \"Grilled shrimp with Romano crusted eggplant and a black pepper cream sauce.\" - A surprise goodie!  Came with eight shrimp/eggplant stacks and definitely would definitely order again.

* Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread \"Fresh Mozzarella and housemade tomato sauce.\" - Good pizza where they aren't shy about the toppings.

* Shrimptini \"Chilled shrimp served in a martini glass with roasted tomato cocktail sauce and fresh lemon.\"  Uneventful of the bunch, fine for simple shrimp but lacks any excitement.

* Roasted Red Pepper & Fresh Mozzarella Bruschetta \"With fresh basil and balsamic drizzle.\" - Tasty bread bites with four pieces of bruschetta.

This time we went with a group of four and ordered one of everything.  It pretty much filled us for the most part, although if you're hungry, just double up on the burgers and meatballs.  We grabbed a little table this time in the bar area inside and our waitress was fine again.  It took a bit of time to get the table cleared and for the orders to go in, but nothing to complain about.  

Overall, they did well again for filling our tummies on a budget!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the brio in town square every time I was in town, but this one is just as good, without the crowd. And it's closer to where I stay. 

PS...I've recently stopped eating meat. When I ordered my usual dish (a pasta with chicken, pine nuts, tomatoes, idk what it's called but it's delicious) but asked for it without chicken, the waiter asked if I wanted to sub anything in it's place. Yes please! I asked for eggplant. I think I enjoyed it more with the eggplant than I ever did with the chicken. Hopefully if I end up at another location at some point they will do the same."}
{"text":"I walked in and felt like i was in a hotel. Maybe bellagio cafe or something. not sure. But it didnt feel like any italian restaurant ive ever been to. not that thats a bad thing. the bread they put on the table was somewhat epic. im not sure ive ever said that about bread, but it was. the butter was on the sweeter side but the bread was so good it didnt need butter. for an entree i ordered the chicken pomodoro classico. probably the best pasta dish ive ever had in vegas. Direct from the menu...\"Angel hair with grilled chicken, tomatoes, pine nuts, basil, Parmigiano-Reggiano and pesto drizzle 14.15\"...yum. the pine nuts were a really nice touch.

what i dont understand though is why they dont have gingerale. the waitress was really sweet and tried to make it by mixing pepsi with sprite. but it didnt taste like gingerale. so i just had a pepsi. 

overall really good for lunch. im told lunch here is better than dinner. who knows. get gingerale!"}
{"text":"Brio hands down is fantastic. From this location, patio, bar and restaurant, food and drinks, we always find ourselves coming back here. We either sit on the patio or at the bar when Mandi is working. She's so awesome and pays equal attention to all of her guests. Very down to earth with a fun personality. Her espresso martinis are one of the best. Trust me on that! The food has never once when disappointing and the flour less chocolate cake is one of the best! Also to note they offer a rewards program! They have an AWESOME Happy Hour with food and drinks. Plz check out the menu as there is almost something for everyone. The patio is casual with tables and also offer laid back lounging with cushion patio furniture. 

Also note the patio is not puppy friendly so no pooches allowed there.

Other then that this restaurant is great!"}
{"text":"I've driven by Brio many of times and never really had any desire to visit this place. My family talked me into it the other night. So it was game on for this place. 

Walking into Brio I was a little surprised. It seemed like a more upscale Macaroni Grille. They use butcher paper for their table tops but fancier than MG. They have high ceilings and somewhat reminded me of some of the Las Vegas places with high ceiling and huge lights. Very nice decor. 

We started off with their bread basket of hot sour dough and flat bread. Really good. Down right outstanding. So if this was good I can't wait for our meals so come. 

I ordered the Sausage Peperonata Pomodoro. Very nice dish. Nice amount of sausage that had a little kick with tender pasta, cherry tomatoes, and Broccoli. The cream sauce was really good. It was really tasty and I really enjoyed it. 

I would say the star of our dinner was my wife's Balsamic Strawberry Chicken Salad. Wow. Outstanding. My wife was raving about it and everyone tried it. Both of my kids said that next time they are going to order this salad. It was the BOMB. I don't remember what was in it but it was booming with flavor. 

My daughter really liked her Chicken Pomodoro Classico with the red sauce. Looked really good and she just gobbled it up. My so ordered the Raviloi Di Bello and it had mushrooms and tomatoes. I tried this and the Raviloi was so fresh with cheese in the middle. It was very good and filling. 

We had a really good meal and everyone enjoyed their dinner. Our server was Dane S. She was really good. She welcomed us very quickly at our table and brought us our water cups. She was always paying attention to us. She did a great job but she was all business. She didn't show no personality but that's okay. 

So let's see. Nice decor, high ceilings which makes the place a little loud (that's okay), very good food, and excellent service. What more can you ask for.  So I enjoyed a great meal and will definitely be back. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I was initially let down that there was too long of a wait for the patio as it was a gorgeous day outside..nothing their white peach sangria couldn't fix! I'm normally a red wine kinda gal, but seeing as this was recommended by both my boyfriend and the server I decided to give it a try. It was good until (almost) the last drop...last few sips tasted like straight soda. 

    On to the food. I have had quite a few beef carpaccios in my day but none come even CLOSE to comparing to the one they have at Brio. It was about half the size of me, unbelievably fresh and drizzled in what tasted like a garlic aioli. Mind. Blown. The Caprese salad was pretty tasty as well but needed a bit more balsamic glaze; I was too emanored by the carpaccio to remember to ask for more hehe. We also had the bruschetta quattro, Pasta Brio and the special bruschetta, which was a spicy shrimp with lobster butter. I, being allergic to shellfish, could not have the special bruschetta, hence why we ordered this way.

    I deducted a star because the shrimp bruschetta was on the serving plate with the other assorted bruschettas. My allergy is not deathly so I simply avoided the pieces on either side of the shrimp, but as a server they should be a little more careful when a guest states they have an allergy. Hives aren't exactly my idea of a \"fun\" Friday night. 

   On a side note: The Pasta Brio tastes just as good cold as it does fresh out of the kitchen."}
{"text":"I had the chipotle chicken and bacon panini- it was the bomb! Also had a bite of the risotto chicken, and it was good. Some of the decor and ledges were a little dusty, but overall really great dining experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service, it was my second time I was excited to bring my mom here for her birthday but the service just sucked!

We came in around 7pm & was seated right away. Our table was far from everyone else kinda in a corner but 20 mins after they sat a bigger party on our side. But it felt like we didn't matter, kinda felt embarrassed bringing my mom here for her birthday. 

Our server couldn't remember her name but she would forget things, they were having specials about steak and lobster that we were interested in she had told us she'll bring us the brochure never did, when we asked her for it she said there wasn't any left but I don't think she bothered to check...
It took 40 minutes for our food to come out, at the 30 min mark she asked how was everything? All they brought out was our soup & salad, we had asked where our food has been she had no idea.. she knew we were frustrated so she had her manager Hannah apologize to us... but what's apologize going to do when everyone is starving on top of that getting horrible customer service??
She also kept refilling the coke my sister had ordered but not once refilled our water until we finally had ask the MANAGER.

Over all not a good experience coming from a restaurant like this..."}
{"text":"Brio is one of the best happy hour restaurants around. The food is a great deal! The shrimp and eggplant dish is my favorite. The burgers are juicy and full sized at happy hour prices. The sangria, both red and white are delish! If you want a deal, and quality food, look no further!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. A bit loud that's why it's 4. Otherwise the service has always been great. The wait is not too bad. The food has always been good. The lobster bisque is a bit too oily but other dishes are great. Would definitely recommend it. In fact among all the restaurants at Crocker park, I would recommend Brio for quality. 
Oh by the way the happy hours is also great. They have the most amazing burger."}
{"text":"The fresh bread is to die for, I think I have gone to Tuscany heaven!!! I had an  omelette, this time. Nice flavor served open face. Great atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch and a glass of wine every time I am in Las Vegas. Are usually opt for the shrimp Mediterranean which is a very tasty low calorie option on their menu. It is plenty of food to feel satisfied and still healthy. Add a glass of rose and that round out the meal very well. The cracker bread and sourdough loaf that they serve or both delicious as well.
Today I just stopped in for a glass of wine and to use the Wi-Fi so I could get some work done while waiting to check into my hotel. I found a comfortable seat in the bar area and couldn't believe how great the service from both the bartender and the support staff were. I had to write a review just to comment on how wonderful they were even though I wasn't eating. 
Great job and I will return next month!"}
{"text":"Did an online order and I picked it up.  First I waited 30 Min beyond scheduled picked up time.  They forgot the salad that I ordered with my $35 steak meal.  Ordered medium rare and was given well done...not edible.  Called the manager and was told if I come in regularly to find her and she will give me something extra.  Well I won't be going back...can afford to pay for another wasted meal

Follow up:  I actually never experienced such good customer service to resolve my issue.  I was contacted by Brio and really received a sincere apology."}
{"text":"LOVE Brio. Food is always great service is always on point. And let's not forget how awesome the bellinis are!!! Highly recommend even if just for a lunch for one."}
{"text":"It feels like if you're not willing to shell out big bucks for the extravagant restaurants, you're going to eat crap. I was very grateful for this restaurant because food was reasonable and tasted reasonable as well.

I ordered the pasta alla vodka, and it was delicious. I love stuffed pasta, and this didn't disappoint stuffed with ricotta. The portions aren't as large as you'd expect from Olive Garden or some other pasta place, but larger portions doesn't always mean better food anyways. We saved half of our entrees to save as leftovers and munched on an extra serving of fresh bread. Yum!"}
{"text":"Brio is very pretty, light, quiet, not the best place if you have rowdy kidlets. 
 The Calamari is VERY good, and the Lobster Bisque is uite tasty. The desserts are smal enough to be crazy, except the cheesecake, but if you're prdering cheesecake calories may not be your focus. heh
 We had two great servers, and were checked on often, but my daughters coffee never got refilled. There was a chari in a sitting near us LEAKING. Dripping onto the floor. No one knew why and the servers stared at for a long time after I pointed it out, but no one cleaned it up.....? Really?"}
{"text":"I was here last week for Happy Hour with friends. Staff was friendly and helpful as always and the food was spot on.

I've been going to Brio for years. They are always consistent. Regardless of when I'm there, the food is always flawless.

The convenient location in Tivoli makes it the best place to stop for a quick bite before a movie or routine Summerlin shopping trip

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I was initially concerned because it is located in a shopping area but was extremely impressed when I walked in.  The restaurant is beautiful and very inviting!  I absolutely loved the ambiance...if you like Tuscan Mediterranean decor with wrought iron, rich colors, and beautiful architecture..this is the place....it is loud, but hey everyone one seemed to be enjoying themselves...Our waiter introduced himself as Mr. Meat and he had a great personality and made great recommendations..we started out with the calimari..loved the marinara on the side but not a fan of the white sauce though.  Their chopped salad was fresh, and crisp with chopped olives, tomatoes, cheese and mouth watering vinaigrette.  My husband had the shrimp mediterranean...grilled prawns, spinach, cherry tomatoes, tossed in a delicious light sauce over a bed of orzo..loved it!   I had the creamy cheesy bacony chicken carbonara with baby spinach tossed into the mix!  Bread was delish..  Loved the experience..will definitely be back when visit Vegas again.."}
{"text":"We had our weeding dinner in their banquet room. Their staff was top notch and accommodating. The banquet planner had everything set up well and the food was outstanding.
It created an experience for a lot of my family who were not accustomed to a dinning experience like this.
We are very grateful to their whole team for making this day memorable."}
{"text":"This place was really just ok.  Its overpriced Italian food but with a beautiful ambiance.  Went here and made a reservation.  Thank goodness we did because the wait would have been over an hour!!  And even with a reservation they sat us 15 mins later.....

We got water and menus promptly and decided to order the pasta tuscano, the vodka pasta, the shrimp and eggplant appetizer and the beef Carpaccio.  Food came out relatively quickly and we got everything at once.  The beef Carpaccio was plated beautifully.  It was in this gigantic plate that took up the whole table space.  Beef was sliced super thin and stuck to the plate.  You can't even pick up a piece of it without tearing.  I don't know if that's good or bad.   But it was delicious and fresh.  The eggplant and shrimp was probably my favorite dish.  A little salty but the eggplant was perfectly fried and crispy.  It was not mushy at all even though it was smothered in sauce.

As for the pastas, the noodles were cooked well.  It wasn't aldente and I actually liked that it was softer.  The tuscano pasta is Bolognese made with sausage instead of beef.  I was disappointed because it tasted overly cheesy and the sausage is overwhelming.  I think I like the original version with beef better.  The vodka pasta was very good.  It was ricotta stuffed pasta in a creamy tomato sauce.  The ricotta was light and airy and the tart tomato sauce balanced it well.

Overall, this is not a place I will come to again on my own.  Its a nice ambiance, but too expensive for the quality of food.  Our waiter was also super FORGETFUL.  Had the ask for water, plate, fork, check TWICE."}
{"text":"I originally intended to hit up their happy hour, but it being a Friday night, it was too packed. Decided to get a table for dinner instead. I was hesitant because it seemed a bit on the pricey side for some of their dishes. But after tasting the food... no regrets. I had the pasta alla vodka. Our waitress said that it is their best selling dish. I can see why. Oh, and the marscapone cheesecake? OMGRN. My only qualm was how loud the dining area was. I will try to go back on weekday for happy hour."}
{"text":"OMG, I LOVE LOVE LOVE this Brio location! Practically every single time we go there, we have exceptional service and tasty food (the bread is to die for!). If something's not right, they fix it right away. 

My favorite dish is their beef medallions...I don't know what's in the sauce, but it's addicting! And their desserts are good too. The restaurant has a very nice ambiance to it, it's very rustic and relaxing. 

I highly recommend trying Brio out if you're in the mood for some good Italian food and great service!"}
{"text":"The food was great and the dessert was excellent. We had the Dolchino Trio dessert plate. Best of all was our server Alexander. He did everything right. He served us the night of 11/11/2017. We didn't have to wait for anything. He offers us bread after we finished our first bread plate, filled out waters frequently, recommended plates."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with my bestie n had great time. Food was delicious! We Had my favorite beef carpaccio as appetizer. My entree was shrimp & lobster pasta which was so yummy!! Service was good n the place wasn't crowded this time. Dinner was very yummy as usual."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and were pleasantly surprised. They have a $2.95 food menu for happy hour and the options were very good. I had the Margarita flatbread and my companion had the Angus burger. Both tasted great. The burger, although on a $2.95 menu is a full size burger cut into 4 pieces. I also had a mojito which was very good, although this can easily vary by bartender."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. The food was horrible. I complained to the executive chef who was working last weekend. He didn't even have the courtesy to come and see me when asked. Found a band aid in my food. The management criticizes employee's right in front of you. I would hate to be an employee there. A manager Tony belittled a female employee almost to the point she was crying. How extremely unprofessional. Eat at Claim Jumper next door!!!! I would gave NO STARS but I had to give 1."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Brio in Tivoli Village and Town Square for happy hour, lunch and dinner many times over the yrs, sometime with our friends, too, and always have good experiences. 

This evening my wife and I went for an early dinner. The pleasant hostess took us to a nice and quiet corner table. The dining room was not crowded, yet, so was pretty quiet, although the bar area was hopping, as the patio was a bit too cold, even for the tough young crowd. Our server, Kim, was very friendly and helpful, and got our beer orders (Blue Moon, $5.25) started immediately. Good thing she did that for us, too, because the barkeeps were kept super busy by those happy yuppies, who \"never seem to have to work!\"  Boy do I envy them!  ;-)  
The wait staff quickly brought us our favorite bread basket with warm and delicious rolls, which we enjoyed over our beers. And I started feeling great!

BTW: Brio's STILL  DON'T serve Blue Moon on DRAFT, yet, only in a bottle! SIGH! 

For dinner, my wife ordered the \"Sliced steak salad\" (15.95), and I had the \"Mediteranian shrimps\" (15.95). Both were delicious! The steak was tender and juicy and in good quanty; shrimps were cruchy fresh and very tasty! Their presentations were quite appetizing - I totally forgot to take any pics of our dishes, being distracted by our hunger and discusions on our travel plans for 2014! Trust me, our dinners looked good! 

Our sweet server Kim (no, she is NOT Korean) was attentive and pleasant; her crew was efficient, keeping our water glasses full, and putting our finished dishes discreetly away. Kim also did us a great favor, taking the time to straighten out the mistakes with my Brio's reward account and honored my $15 reward credits - very nice of her!

During our dinner, the hostess (perhaps also mgr) came by to say hello, and later helped the waitress out with our check. [i.e., taking it to/from the cashier, but NO, she did NOT really help out with the $Check, You Silly!]  ;-)   - A nice business practice! 

The Brio brand is characterized by its reliable, good italian style cuisine of VALUE; spaciousness, comfy ambience; vibrant bar scene; excellent service. Hmm...table cloths also add a touch of elegance. Of course there are other comparable restaurants, but I think Brio stands out in ITS CLASS. 
- My friends say, it's like dining in a \"Mid-Upscale\" restaurant at Olive Garden prices. 

For me, the Brio's in general and this locale in particular is one of the places I would go on a whim for happy hour (their $4 tasty small plates, Wed Martinis...are hard to resist at times) and/or for a tasty meal - NO SURPRISES!

{"text":"As we were still dining, I literally thought of those award shows where the recipient thanks everyone including their kindergarten teacher for helping them become the success they are now. That is what it's like to dine here. The hostesses were friendly and greeted everyone warmly as soon as you stepped inside. 
     The waitstaff is knowledgeable about their menu, friendly, and attentive. Seriously. You can gaze around you and see that at every table. 
     The place itself is nice and they make sure that it stays looking that way. The people busing the tables were prompt and thorough. One second it seemed like their were dirty plates on the table next to us, and the next, gone. 
     The food! Everything we ordered was cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. When you leave thinking about what other things you want to try as well the next time because it was so good... 
     By this point I'm sure that you get the reason for the 5 stars and why I recommend this place to anyone reading this review.  They do have outdoor seating, although we didn't see anyone dining outside at the dinner hour we were there. Dress seemed more casual with those who looked under 30 and casual nice to a little dressy for those older than 30. Just what I observed."}
{"text":"The food was good.. the only thing I'm taking couple stars off the review is because our waitress kinda sucked.. I understand that it was dinner rush but she hardly checked up on us after the food was dropped off.."}
{"text":"This time was good, I ordered porkchops. Service was good. I've ordered some pasta dishes in past but I think I'm going to stick with the grill menu items if I am coming here."}
{"text":"I went in during happy hour with one of my friends the selection was fantastic and the bartender was so friendly the only thing I would say is there was some other lady behind the bar that wasn't the bartender I don't think and she was so unfriendly I was nervous to ask for a to go box I would definitely come again and one bad apple doesn't spoil my experience I loved the soup"}
{"text":"Although this is an Italian chain restaurant, I really think Brio is above the rest of its chain competition.  An old friend reached out to me the other day and suggested we do dinner, so we decided to visit this place last night.  

The place is dramatic.  There's linen draping the entire top of the inside.  The lighting is dim and super intimate.  Great place for a date!  Our server was cordial and didn't bother us much during our meal.  I appreciate very personable service and a lot of interaction, so it was a little quiet for my taste, but not bad to say the least.  

Tonight, we got a bottle of the Tavolo Matto (house brand) pinot grigio.  It was good enough for a house wine at $24 for the bottle.  I also go the sweet potato & chicken risotto for $17.65 which is a weird price.  One thing I can always count on Brio to deliver is an awesome risotto!  So creamy and perfect!  I LOVED the big chunks of sweet potato, asparagus and chicken.  Brio tends to change what they add into their risottos however, I don't mind.  Whatever they add, I know is always good.

I don't tend to visit this place often because I consider it on the higher end of my budget.  I don't really think spending $30 a meal (including drinks) is spending my money effectively, however, it's a great place to visit once in a while.  Tonight was a special occasion and I'm convinced that Brio will be a great place to return to on another occasion!"}
{"text":"Attention: Their Happy Hour Menu is BETTER than McCormick & Schmicks!

I thought I would never say this, but for the quality (better) & price (same) you can get more for your tummy & money here.

Monday - Thursday 3 - 7 PM, 9 - 11 PM + Friday 3 - 7 PM you can enjoy their Tuscan Tasters menu for $2.95. You don't even have to purchase a beverage to get this deal either...just sit in the bar area. 

The bar area is half-inside and half-outside with a bar, but also high tables and even some nice chairs (but they go fast!)

We tried the: 
*Brio Burger - great \"soft\" burger w/ homemade chips
Ravioli Caprese - crusted ravioli w/ tomato/mozzarella drizzle
Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant - seared shrimp & breaded eggplant
Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread - self-explanatory on cracker bread
Steak Bruschetta - steak & arugala on french bread

Liked all of them...burger & pizza were the most filling. Shrimp was small, but tasty. Bruschetta & ravioli had a nice taste to them.

Dessert Trio: hazelnut/chocolate cannoli, caramel cheesecake & choc chip bread pudding. 

This dessert was awesome! We were about to leave, but I saw the dessert tray (better seeing what you're getting in person - great marketing tactic for visual learners like me) and was hooked! 

Each dessert had tons of flavor that you had to take small bites to enjoy each sensation in your mouth. 

I can't say enough great things about this place. The fact it was off the strip and mostly locals went there was one of the best parts. I learned that waking the strip is quite overrated....

Service was great and I am definitely hitting this place up EVERYTIME I go to vegas..."}
{"text":"This place is really beautiful.
My date took me here on my birthday. 
We were seated in a huge round booth in the back facing the whole restaraunt, it's so beautful especially from that view. I love the ceiling decor.
It was $5 Martini Thursdays! so of course I had a caramel chocolate martini and he had a dirty martini with blue cheese olives
he gave me one of the olives, so good!
for Appetizer we had Lobster Bisque Soup and Spicy Shrimp with Eggplant, both were delicious. I don't even like Eggplant, but this was actually good.
The appetizers were filling so we shared a entree of Gorgonzola Lamb chops (not on the menu) with this great spinach salad. I definitely recommend BRIO, those lamb chops were to die for. They pre split it up for us and we both had 4 miniature lamb chops and a side of spinach. That was thoughtful.

For dessert they bring over examples of all the desserts they offered. I ordered Butterscotch Pecan Bread Pudding and another caramel chocolate martini.

Then they surprised me with a Raspberry Mascarpone Cheesecake with 3 lit candles on it. That was so sweet. I made a wish and blew them out."}
{"text":"Was there while ago with my girlfriend, we ordered Vodka pasta and fillet mignon. Server was nice, complimentary bread, to be honest, I touched a bit and did not even pay attention onto. bread was cold, and hard. And it did not go well with butter either. But what made us our day was the main dishes.

Vodka Pasta - Flavor that I never tried it before. Creamy, flavorful, usually if you eat pasta, it sometimes does not have flavors that smothered into the pasta. At least the pasta that I tried, it was just so good and the cheese inside really harmonized well with the pasta and sauce. Which was one of the best pasta I have tried.

Fillet Mignon - Ordered Medium Rare, and it was cooked perfectly. I have never tried fillet mignon that is as juicy and tender as the one that I have tried here. And also, their side dish, I don't know what its called, but side of the potato and sauce on the top was just a killer. Something that you must try.


overall, it was a great experience and after I have tried all the other steakhouse, I will for sure come back to eat pasta and steak again."}
{"text":"We came in and were told it was a 45 minute wait or we could sit on the patio and be seated immediately. Seeing that it wasn't 120 degrees outside, we went for the patio. Our server was friendly and promptly brought us ice water and we ordered our spinach artichoke dip appetizer which was so good! My husband ordered the lasagna while I chose the shrimp and lobster fettuccine and a lump crab cake. So this is where disaster could have struck. We finally realized we had been waiting over 30 minutes for our food and the server finally arrived. While my dish was great, my husband's was ice cold. It looked congealed and just gross. We asked for a manager and he came out and we explained the situation and I said I wouldn't pay for his dish. The manager apologized and asked if he could redo it and make it to go since it was obvious we wouldn't be waiting any longer. He said the meal was on him and I said that was nice but really, just remove my hubby's dish. He ended up comping our meal and I had to get a soda to go so I could tip my server since we had no cash on us. I'm not going to punish her when it was an issue with the kitchen! That is the type of manager more places should have; it was apparent he cared about his guests and place of business and went over and beyond what he had to do. I really really hope he is recognized for this and we will be back again since we love coming to this place."}
{"text":"I came here with a big group from work for lunch last week. There were 3 servers assigned to our table, and they were all friendly. They were also pretty good about keeping all of our drinks filled, especially considering there was 12 of us.

I was trying to be healthy, so I ordered the tilapia and roasted vegetables. It was surprisingly good and had a little spicy kick to it. Plus, the portion size was very generous. Everyone else seemed to be pretty happy with their food too.

Although I had a good experience, I don't think it was anything special, especially considering the prices. If I had to actually pay, I think I would have been a little disappointed. All in all, it's not a bad place, it's just missing that certain something to push it up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Ahh, Brio. The finer side of dining. It is one of my favorite place to eat pasta and salad. But not at this location. Town Square is much better, and nicer too! 

Ambiance: 3 - I mean, since you have the huge one at Town Square to compare it to, with TS's nice, high ceilings and romantic lighting..this location would be average. Tivoli seems like it caters more to families than the couples, adults, and tourists that crowd Town Square, sipping on wine and fancily buttering their bread. 

Service: 4 - Our server was extremely funny and had a great personality. If there's one thing about Summerlin..they know customer service. 

Food: 3 - First thing that has to get out: Food is a bit too pricey for what it is. I mean $15 dollars for a steak salad?! Come on now haha! 

I do admit that I am really into salads lately, and Brio's sliced steak salad is one of my favorite combinations of meat and greens. But I do remember thinking that it was wayyy better at TS. 

It was the meat that was -just slightly- better in quality at the other location. JUST slightly. It just tasted better at TS. 

Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. It was average. Brio Tivoli is still a fair place to eat. But if there was a race... Brio Town Square would win."}
{"text":"I had a really good experience here at Brio; the food was warm and good..the dessert was delicious, but the menu isn't anything really special. they are just regular, run of the mill items.

It's clean, the waiters are nice and it's not very crowded! it's in a pretty cute area that you can spot it from the street. 

my opinion is that the one thing that stands out at Brio is the steak salad and the alcoholic beverages. those are my go-to favorites!"}
{"text":"This is a sad story of a restaurant that when first open had great food, service and prices.  Unfortunately, I have seen the prices go up and everything else go down hill.  I hadn't been there in some time because I was not impressed with the last few times I had been.  But, as someone who goes out to dinner several times a week, I thought I would give it a try.  I ordered the salmon and could not believe what a small portion it was, but even sadder was when you flipped it over it was char BLACK on one side!!!  The waiter did take it back but it should have never been served and how awkward is it for the other people at the table to eat their food???  Don't think they will see me again!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite happy hour spots and usually it's the first place that rolls off of our tongue on our Friday date night..everything that we have had is very good and so far we have been able to come right in and sit at the bar or around the bar.  So my 5 stars is worthy and we have been coming here for since they opened."}
{"text":"We had a great time at Brio the server Max was on top of everything very friendly and the manager Joe was very gracious and welcoming. We had ordered the lobster tail shrimp and risotto was an epicurean delight   We all 6 plan on returning soon and will be hosting a birthday party soon and plan on taking our friends there."}
{"text":"Have the opportunity last Monday to go to Brio Tuscan grille santan was warmly greeted by the general manager Joe who directed to our table John was our server he was did a very professional job the food was amazing and we will come back more often thank you for your friendliness having such a great general manager and server. You are the best."}
{"text":"I was wanting an inexpensive but good steak. I went with Pork chop plate instead-it was delicious! The vegetables did have an interesting flavor...
This was our second visit and not our last. Good variety of options for the good price"}
{"text":"A double cappacino with artichoke heart dip and caprese.  Dining outside on Easter Sunday...here's a tip. No wait for outside dining and fortyfiveminutes for inside. Inside is noisy and your words bounce off the wall 

Having a salmon salad.  Oh yum. Lots of options under 500 calories by the way"}
{"text":"I have wanted to eat here for a long time but my boyfriend is not fond of Italian. My mom and I Planned on coming to town square to hang out and do some shopping and we we're both hungry so I remembered Brio had a happy hour and it was almost 4 so perfect timing. 

We came in and sat by the bar for happy hour and I was kind of worried it would be too hot since it was hot outside , but the bar area is shaded so it worked out fine. Even if you do sit by the patio by the walkway and street they have misters and umbrellas. 

I decided to have a white peach Sangria which is $4 on the happy hour menu it was so refreshing and perfect for the hot weather and presented very pretty. My mom had a virgin Italian Lemonade because she was scared to drive with a drink in her :). For food we decides to go with Crispy Eggplant Fries ( recommended by a friend on yelp Thanks Nieves ! ) crispy ravioli and Tomato Mozzerella Salad just to start. The eggplant fries were perfectly crispy and super yummy. The pomodoro sauce for both the ravioli and fries was so yummy. The raviolis lacked flavor in my opinion. The tomato Mozzerella salad was really fresh and the balsamic glaze was perfect. It could have had more basil and glaze but that's ok. I just asked for some more glaze ;). I'm glad we only ordered those three dishes because a few raviolis in and some fries later I was stuffed. 

All the servers were friendly and food and drinks came out fast. Despite how busy it was. I suggest coming early and seeing if there is a wait because it filled up fast for happy hour. I will definitely be coming back to try the regular menu as I'm lasagna lover and I'm out to find the best in vegas. That I'm yet to find maybe it's hiding here at Brio. I'll find out sooner or later."}
{"text":"An excellent place for an early lunch as it fills up fast! It's huge inside and will remind you of a cross between an Olive Garden and a Macaroni Grill.

Similar food as the above mentioned restaurants with a tad nicer dining room.

Service was VERY good and FAST.  Food comes quickly.

Meals that include the salad are few, but for what it's worth, the chopped salad is incredible!  It's a meal by itself so make sure to share it.

The bread and crackers included with the meal aren't memorable and aren't served with any oil or spices.  Just butter."}
{"text":"Excellent evening, and wonderful spot for a date. We were seated quickly and greeted right away by our server. She got us waters while we looked through the wine menu. Brought us back bread and waters. We ordered wine and shortly after, our meals. Our meals came out quickly and hot. It was delicious. He ordered a steak and I ordered a pasta dish. Our server checked on us several times, bringing us more wine, more bread and refilling our waters. After eating, we paid our bill and sat and talked until we noticed a line forming at the door. We felt bad for keeping a table so we moved to the bar area for more wine. The staff there was attentive as well. The bar area is a nice area on the side, I think next time we might try sitting outside by the fires. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I came here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend and we loved it. Food was great and our server was so friendly and energetic despite probably having worked a long shift for Valentine's Day. Food came out promptly. I had the Lamb and my boyfriend had the New York Strip. 

The Lamb was seasoned well with lots of flavor and they were big shanks. I got the Brio potatoes which were very big and had this white sauce drizzled in which our server was a mix of ranch and cheese. Would recommend these. 

My boyfriend got the New York strip which was cooked perfectly however was lacking flavor. It wasn't anything to rave about and could've used even just a bit more salt and pepper. This is the reason Brio doesn't get 5 stars.

Dessert was a chocolate lava cake and it was so darn good! Molten chocolate inside and the cake just fell apart and mixed in with the ice cream. Definitely recommend this as a great way to top off your meal. 

Brio was not as romantic as I had expected. Don't get me wrong it was a beautiful restaurant, but it was very open and big. I was hoping for something a little more dark lit and intimate, but Brio better represents a nicer Olive Garden. I would say Cheesecake Factory is a better choice for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday and had to wait 20 minutes. After waiting, walked inside and half the restaurant was empty. 

After being seated and ordering, we waited 40 minutes for our food. When I asked how much longer our food would take she said \"it takes 15-18 minutes to make your food\" in a very snarky tone. 

When the food came out the steak was cold and the salad was soggy like it had been plated and left too long. The 2 pasta dishes we ordered were fine. 

In years of dining out, I've never had to speak to the manager of a restaurant to complain about service. The manager wasn't very helpful either and said she would check with us to make sure everything was ok but never saw her again.  The restaurant was obviously understaffed and mismanaged."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. I can't wait to return. Had a strawberry chicken salad. They serve you warm bread. Happy hour looks really good. I plan to return for that. The service was 5 star and the ambience 5 star and food 5 star. Everything I saw coming out of the kitchen looked so good. I will be back soon. Tivoli village is such a beautiful place too."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in several years. They do a solid job. Food was prepared just right and service was pretty good. Nothing to complain about other than my personal bias against chain restaurants as they all seem to have an institutional feel and there's never anything too exciting on the menu, just stuff that appeals to the masses. Overall pretty good and reasonable price for what you get. Good spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Planned my wedding reception in the round private room in the back here in 2011. When arriving to go over things the night before my wedding which was already hectic, the service I received was crap. However the next day the pulled it out and did an outstanding job. The day before is my only reasoning behind not giving them five stars. Without mentioning the total amount I paid...lets just say a small fortune. That erked me. The food was delicious and the prefixed menu came out nice. They did screw up the seating chart but who cares. The ambiance were nice and all and all it was a good choice."}
{"text":"I love coming here for happy hour! $2.95 food menu :) 

The only thing that sucks about happy hour is that it's only in the bar area only and the bar area can get packed really fast so come early to get a good table. Also, another thing I love about this place is their chocolate mints haha I think it's so much better than olive garden too. 

The staff here can also be a bit slow and lazy. Because every time i come here and there are empty plates on the table, the server would not pick it up unless we handed them the plate ourselves. It's a bit obvious that we're done with the plate when there's nothing left on the plate"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to sit at the bar today because we didn't have the kids and it made our experience so amazing! Bri was one of the beat bartenders in Vegas we have ever had the pleasure to meet. Thank you bri for turning around our opinion on service here!!!! We will definitely be back just to spend time with her and indulge in the delicious food! To top it off we ran into Alyssa who was an amazing server in another restaurant months ago. Good job Brio for hiring experienced personable servers and bartenders it makes the difference especially when we only have a couple hours alone!!!!"}
{"text":"I just experienced the sea scallop risotto and it was delicious.  As was the chopped salad. As was the bread and butter...lol.  I was greeted with a smile.  Served with friendliness.  Best place I've eaten in town square so far."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale with my girlfriend and went to Brio for dinner. Had the pleasure of meeting Chef Jeffrey Perin, who gave us some fantastic recommendations. We started with the Bruschetta Quattro, a nice sample of their house-made bruschetta. We then moved onto the Fennel Sausage & Roasted Tomato Trecce Pasta, which was very flavorful and satisfying. Next, we enjoyed the 14 oz Gorgonzola crusted Bistecca, which was outstanding. The meal ended on a sweet note with a petite, peanut butter & chocolate mousse. All in all, it was a great experience and a delicious meal! Next time we're in town, we will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to. Have been there several time and every time: Horrible service. Food is mediocre and overpriced. Also, the veal is extremely salty. Not sure why it has so many stars....lol working for the food industry for years, I can't understand how they have such good business. One of my coworkers even left to work there and came back to the original job within a month. Not worth it to go there, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a wedding and this was the reception. We arrived and I was skeptical because we we're at a mall and I was like \"Really?\". Turns out I was totally wrong! We arrived and we were taken to the back for the reception in a big open room. Food took a while but it was worth the wait! We received two different salads. One was a blue cheese with bacon and the other was your normal Caesar salad. Next came was fruits slices of grapes, blue berries, pineapples, and watermelon. The entrees finally came and it was freaking insane! We had asparagus seared with salsa salmon, creamy mashed potatoes, filet mignon, and their house pasta. The chicken pasta was my favorite dish because I had never eaten anything like it. Super delicious was the steak, tender and juicy with each bite. The salmon was a bit dry and the asparagus was sweet and crunchy.  Desert was a little coffee cup with cream, caramel, and cake. Very good place to eat and I would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"I went here with my sister one afternoon, and the service was a little off putting, seeing as I go here a lot. I was disappointed in my experience and told management about it. 
About a month later, I went in with my boyfriend. Got a nice bottle of wine, and we ordered some amazing food! I really liked the blackened tilapia. Our server was really awesome. Because of my experience last time, the management came to our table and was very apologetic. And discounted the whole meal! (Which I said I'd pay for the majority of it.) I was so impressed with my visit this time around I had to tip the waiter nicely, seeing as I got my meal comped. Will be back around to possible drink 2 bottles of wine :P"}
{"text":"I don't usually review a chain restaurant but this one is special.  Although it is located in a \"mall\", it offers great outdoor seating in a comfy environment.  

Big plus, its meant for Vegas residents so its inexpensive.

They have a great tasting bar menu from M-F 3:30pm-6:30pm and M-Thurs 9:00pm till closing where all items are just 2.95.  Not just talking fries or chips either.  Great burger, sausage and pepperoni flat bread, beef carpaccio, spicy shrimp and eggplant, etc.  

Don't make the mistake of ordering the entire menu like a buddy and I did.  First your server and bartender will laugh at you (noob), and second, no way you will finish it (wasteful noob).

Wines are very inexpensive.  Large by the glass selection and generous pours are the norm.

If its a cooler night, sit outside by a fire pit and make some friends.

Service is very friendly (its a locals place).  Family friendly.

Oh yeah, the regular menu for lunch and dinner is also very good and fairly priced but you cannot beat the bar menu for price.

Well worth it."}
{"text":"I gave this place three tries over the course of a year.  I really like the decor, so I added a second star.

For Italian, it is Olive Garden grade at best at twice the price.  I have tried pasta, sandwiches and steaks, all of which didn't impress.

Tonight, the fettuccine was mush, stuck together and pasty.  It was obvious that my shrimp and lobster fettuccine was the first of five entrees complete and sat too long.

As they served, they handed me my plate and told me watch out, it is very hot.  Wait, what?   How about doing your job and presenting my entree to me on the table.


More disturbing, I ordered a bottle of wine.  The server poured and I took a couple of sips. I them noticed a two inch crack in the glass.  These things happen, but the waiter wanted to pour the wine from the cracked glass into another glass.  Wait, what?  (Again)

Overall, mediocre food, mediocre service, VERY LOUD ATMOSPHERE and pretty pricy.

Go to Olive Garden and save your cash."}
{"text":"My fiance and I went to Brio for our fourth anniversary.  We had nothing to complain about - the atmosphere, service, and temperature were really comfortable.  We ordered the artichoke-crusted beef medallions, bistecca insalata, and stuffed peppers.  The food came out faster than I expected and each course was well-timed.  The waiter did a great job keeping our table neat and checked on us appropriately.  Everything was cooked to perfection and very flavorful.  We had a great time and will return for another special occasion... we're poor college kids, so we can't really afford to be \"regulars!\""}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of chain restaurants. Olive Garden, Cheesecake Factory, Outback--you catch my drift? To my palette, everything tastes the same--buttery & salty. I've sampled the Brio dinner menu on numerous occasions and I will not be returning for any entrees.

THE BAR: I frequent Brio for an entirely different reason: a half indoor / half outdoor bar that brings refinement to the ever frowned upon day drinking. In the Spring & Summer, I can be seen in my designer heels relaxing by the bar with a book, sipping on a glass of over-priced shiraz or moscato on a bright, sunny Tuesday afternoon. Town Square is such a pleasant place. A little pop-up of class down the street from what I consider to be the tackiest shopping mall in Las Vegas (Premium Outlets South). 

BAR FOOD: I can't help but jump for joy at cheap food. Brio has a bar menu that's only $2.95 a plate. I've sampled everything on that menu. At 3 bucks a pop, I think I can afford to do so. Serving size is pretty big too. I always order the beef carpaccio: thin-slices of raw beef drizzled with olive oil and other delectables. The flat-breads and ravioli are mediocre. The spicy shrimp is too salty. The burger is a burger. And the ravioli is pretty basic. Then again, at those prices I wouldn't expect anything too fancy.

In short, olive garden food at cheap prices, alcohol, and a pleasant drinking environment to make your day-drinking the slightest bit more upscale."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, the decorations alone in this place is super nice.  I really enjoy seeing the italian coliseum, wood floors, hanging lights.  Something you would see at caesars palace but off the strip.  The food we ordered were a bit lacking.  I ordered the burger which i immediately regretted as i should have ordered something authentic.  My gf ordered the flatbread sausage and pepperoni and you think this would be good, but unfortunately the taste was just okay.  Flat bread pizza tasted like crackers.  The lobster bisque was good.  The lunch menu had some decent pricing though and the meal was quite inexpensive

I would try the raviolis or pasta if i coukd next time i go."}
{"text":"I often come here for happy hour and though there selection is good, I am specifically writing this review on my bartender (nicole). Being as an employee in the industry, a Vegas veteran, and etc. I have to say that Nicole is the sweetest bartender I have had. Now of days (especially in the summer when your working out in the heat) bartenders are short and crabby, Nicole was very sweet, and made my visit comfortable!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasant  experience. Above average chain restaurant, very clean, servers are nice and food is delicious! Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"1 star for the server in the bar and the manager. Went in early during happy hour. Was seated immediately, greeted by male server and drink order taken. Server said he'd bring a happy hour menu. Another food runner/server brought the cocktail to me and I waited 15 minutes...for a menu. 

5 stars for the hostess (all of them, actually--every time). I asked to be reseated and the hostess was extremely apologetic and quickly took care of the issue. She had the manager take me to a new table. When I explained what happened to him, he said nothing, but \"Would you like to order off the bar's happy hour menu in the main restaurant?\" While I appreciated that offer, an apology would have been the appropriate action, talking to the offended server would also have been an appropriate action (I doubt this happened). I've eaten there dozens of times and this manager is severely lacking in customer service skills. 

5 stars for Jennifer the new server. She was friendly, knowledgeable and turned my dining experience around. Thank you Jennifer and the hostesses. Brio almost lost a neighborhood customer."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Service was great. Food was excellent. Their happy hour from 3-7 is great. 3.00 entree's.  Everything from a 1/2 pound burger to margherita flat bread pizza is just 3.00.  

Amazing appetizer is the shrimp and eggplant in black peppercorn sauce."}
{"text":"Good food and cocktails went for happy hour had the blackpepper shrimp and the black berry martini. Good bartender and the quality and portion of food is very good"}
{"text":"I'll save you time having to read the rest of this review with this right here:

Good food
Small portions
Big forks

If you want to continue...this place is pretty tasty and for franchised Italian I'd place it above Carraba's and way above the Italian Denny's they call the Olive Garden.

So why 3 stars?

I felt the portions were really small compared to what I can get at a mom and pop Italian joint...perhaps two ravioli entrees for one person would have been sufficient. Also, although the flavor was excellent, I found the sauce accompanying the lobster and shrimp dish a little watery, but the shrimp on top of the raviolis were cooked perfectly. My date liked her Ravioli alla vodka but felt it was small for a dinner portion.

Also the warm bread wasn't bad but wasn't anything amazing and the butter wasn't soft...and the atmosphere is a little dark, but I guess that's what they're going for.

On a bright note, the food came out fast, the waiter was attentive and I went during \"Ravioli Week\" so the 50% off was a great deal...had I walked out hungry paying the normal price of $55 (tax+tip) for two small ravioli dishes I'd have felt ripped.

Did I mention I like their big forks?"}
{"text":"Just had a most delicious strawberry chicken salad at Brios.  Very good service.  Enjoyed the mango tea as well.  Busy place."}
{"text":"We LOVE this place. One of our favorite happy hour spots. Goes til 7:00 so we even have time to go if one of us gets stuck at the office later than expected.

Food is incredible on the happy hour menu. Do yourself a favor and order the Margarita dip for an appetizer. It's unbelievable and super affordable on happy hour.

Probably the best part of coming here is the service. Amber is our favorite waitress and always takes great care of us. Ask to sit in her section if you come!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not incredibly good, especially considering the prices. Most entrees were 18-25 dollars.  I was annoyed that my pasta was undercooked but the dish, Shrimp Verdata?, was pretty good overall. The lobster bisque was excellent. And the waiter and staff were extremely friendly and helpful. When we went there, they were full and booked solid. One friend was 30 minutes late but no one pressured us to hurry. So it's not a bad place to go, but you can get the same quality for cheaper elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food ...good value...nice portions...great service....first time customer gets a free appetizer....wow"}
{"text":"Seeing a familiar place made me very happy.  i was able to order what i knew best.  The service and atmosphere was what i expected.  

Only fault i saw was the bartender failed to explain their specials and had to find them on my own by remembering that i saw signs outside as i was walking in."}
{"text":"On a crazy busy 'day after Christmas' restaurant hunting expedition, our family in Scottsdale took us to Brio.  The food was all-around excellent, and the appetizers were out of this world.  The spinach dip and beef/shrimp appetizers were particularly memorable.  

An extra star for being so kid-friendly!   Our children were crazy/screaming by the time we were finally seated, and the waiters pushed the kids orders through quickly to maintain our sanity.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I ate there on the 4th of July and the service was excellent they had a special running with salad dinner and dessert only $30 the food was excellent worth quite a bit more than the $30 we paid for it my girlfriend me my mother and father all we're stuffed afterwards and decided the food was the best we had a long time the dessert was absolutely incredible the service was speeding the server was polite and pleasant all in all a fantastic restaurant in the Fantastic location Tivoli square is a beautiful little shopping area so much nicer than some of the other locations in the valley"}
{"text":"Came in for the famous lobster bisque. The burrata plate with roasted tomatoes and toasted baguette is awesome. Service was energetic, enthusiastic, and speedy, followed by a check back to make sure the food was up to par. 
          Las Vegas is hit or miss for good service. This time at Brio my wife and I had a fantastic experience. Ask for Josh. Bearded guy with glasses. The guy is just precise."}
{"text":"Brio is definitely a house favorite for my family and I. We're definitely a regular for multiple reasons! 

From the lovely ladies who greeted us to the front to the gentleman that continued to monitor our table to make sure our drinks were refilled as well as our bread basket. Our server was and always is very friendly and needless to say patient. We're pretty indecisive mainly because every dish is so great. I usually don't step out my comfort zone and try new things but here I have no issue picking something new! Yes, I'm that annoying customer who will ask the server what their favorite dish is. I wanted something spicy so I got a pasta dish and as I write this review I've forgotten the name. The point is though you can't go wrong with whatever you choose. 

One thing I will recommend to fellow yelpers is you have to, HAVE TO try their Spicy Eggplant and Shrimp. Don't let the eggplant part scare you off. I know it's not everyone's first choice but you can't go wrong with this dish. It contains pan seared shrimp, Romano crusted eggplant and the best part the black pepper cream sauce. It'll immediately turn into one of your favorites. 

Also, this location had a great happy hour with live music on the patio! It seemed like everyone was enjoying their time while we choose to sit in dinning area. 

Great service, great dishes and a nice atmosphere; WINNING."}
{"text":"One of the best happy hours in Las Vegas. Great food (spicy shrimp, caprese, flat breads). Great drinks. Can't beat the prices. Great ambiance inside or outside."}
{"text":"Such an amazing experience. Came back to this particular Brio because of a prior great experience. The waiter Pedro was really good!! The night went smoothly because of him. He provided great customer service. I keep coming back because of the hospitality that is provided. Fantastic establishment."}
{"text":"LOVE coming here! Nicole M is the best bartender ever! She takes great care of us and is very precise and attentive, even on the busiest of nights! The food is great and the staff is very friendly! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have only been here for appetizers and sat at the bar each time.  The bar is big and has an indoor and outdoor space to choose from. The bartenders are friendly and attentive.  The appetizers are all pretty good.  I enjoy the different types of bruschetta a lot.  They have good drinks and happy hour specials as well."}
{"text":"Friday night was the second time I've visited this place. Atmosphere was nice, pretty dark, servers were very attentive but the food was not something that I would go back for. Especially a third time. Prices are pretty high but I was out with a friend and didnt have the family so that was ok. But the food once again was just mediocre. I ended up having the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. Sauce drowned everything out and made it very soggy tasting...The only thing that made up for the food was that I wasnt paying and my peach bellini (AMAZING)..."}
{"text":"I am super picky about my martinis and have never been disappointed. The food is good but they have hands down the best dessert...."}
{"text":"I love, love, love this restaurant! My husband and I go almost every weekend for dinner or brunch(both are equally great), but my favorite time to go is during their weekday happy hour. The staff is very friendly and efficient, the bartenders know us by name and even remember our cocktail order. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting or who is new in town:) 

p.s. Try the black pepper shrimp and eggplant"}
{"text":"Great off Strip restaurant. Great staff and service. Food is always great. Being Gluten Free is always tricky finding somewhere that caters to intolerances but this place has a great Gluten Free menu."}
{"text":"My review is only for their happy hour, which happens to be AWESOME. $2.95 deals such as a hamburger, shrimp cocktail, steak and gorgonzola bruschetta, and so much more. I must come back here and try everything they offer. It all tasted great. They also have a wide variety of drinks. I ordered the white sangria, which was good. Next time I want to try the strawberry drink. They have wonderful unique options and some have fresh herbs in them. The service was also great. It doesn't get better than happy hour here. I must tell you that if you order the food, there is no special prices for the drinks. However, the drinks are around $7, making the overall deal well worth it."}
{"text":"Nice place..great svc. brad the  server wa great . Yes, food was good. veal marsala with pasta.  the. ac could have worked better. My friends chicken dish was fine;
No free birthday dessert,   boo."}
{"text":"Got a table using the open table app! Had their ravioli, with a Caesar salad that was soooo good. My wife ordered some fish which was also really good according to her. Glad we found this place and had this great meal."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with some friends and everything was great. Had a couple appetizers. Food was amazing as well as the service. Perfect place for any outing."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and have never had a bad experience.  They have plenty of different food options.  Good beer, wine and mixed drinks and great service.  They don't have a bad salad on the menu.   The burgers are great and all the appetizers are on point.  If you want a small meal and some drinks come check out the happy hour.  You won't regret trying Brio."}
{"text":"Brio's food is always the best! A small group of friends gathered for a birthday dinner one slow Tuesday night. The service was great! I recommend the pesto chicken pasta dish!"}
{"text":"Coming here during Happy Hour is like getting a Gourmet-five-star-meal at McDonald's prices. But Better. Much Better. 

A friend and I looked at the Happy Hour Menu ($2.95/item) and ordered: 
1) BRIO Burger - Absolutely so delicious. We split this in half and got full of it alone. I still can't believe it was $2.95. Seriously? That's like 10x better than that 'fancy' Six-Dollar Burger at Carl's Junior. 
2) Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant - My favorite dish. I could have licked the plate til the sauce was gone. The spices and shrimp were so good I know I have to come back here for more. 
3) Sliced Steak Bruschetta - Also another delicious dish. 
4) Quattro Bruschetta ($14.95 value, and we got for free!) - This is the second time eating this bruschetta and the bread was moist with some of the most delicous toppings on top. 

And, our meal only cost $9.63 before tip between 2 people. That's under $5 a person! I highly recommend this place for anyone!! Next time I'll have to try the drinks -- its $2 off during happy hour too!

Tip: Sign up with Brio on their website and get a complimentary Quattro Bruschetta for free!"}
{"text":"Evening before New Year's Eve, my kids, husband and I were hungry after a long day of walking the strip and sightseeing. Been in Vegas countless times but usually for work, so know the restaurants and bars in the hotels. Rarely do we ever leave the strip but the teenagers were asking for Italian so I got on Yelp and found Brio Tuscan Grille. We drove over and found a cute strip of restaurants. We were seated immediately even though they were busy. The decor is cool, the service excellent and the food was on point! Salad was fresh, pastas were made to order. Everything was top notch. Definitely a staple on our future visits to sin city."}
{"text":"location is good, Service was great but my food I have to admit was ok ordered the seared shrimp risotto was salty and oily, unexpected?? But i was hungry and ate it,as I came with a big party and did not want to complain,, but it seems the chicken and sweet potato risotto,looked more like risotto, mine look like a red mess,, maybe I will go back and try  their martini thursday, happy hour..."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Brio from time to time. The interior decor is astonishing. High ceilings, beautiful tables, lots of choices for seating. It's quite appealing.

The food is delicious. Calamari is crunchy and very flavorful. It comes with two sauces, one being marinara. Yum! I usually order the Lobster and Shrimp Fettuccini. People, this entree is beyond this world. My taste buds went on a ride and never came back! Also, the lobster bisque is quite fascinating. Best I've ever tasted.

Service is delightful. I usually get the same server which is just my luck. Happy to say I'm pleased with the staff here.

The price is a bit on the higher end, although you pay for what you eat. Which is royalty.

There is free WiFi, no password needed. No bike racks nearby. Outdoor seating is optional. Reservations aren't required but they always help expedite your seating.

Overall, I'm pleased with the service, food, and amenities here. I'll be back in a few weeks."}
{"text":"Brio, what can't you do!!! My pasta comes out amazing every darn time! Happy hour is boss because you not only save paper on drinks, you also save on food items!!! You can dine inside or outside, or even at the bar. I prefer inside during the day and outside at night. The decor is phenomenal. It feels like I'm dining on the tank. No joke, it's extremely appealing and favorable to the eye. Also, there's tasty candy on your way out by the door. Snatch a pack and enjoy the final touch of your dining experience.

Pros: Delicious food, well priced, great decor, great service, free wifi, takes reservations, clean bathrooms

Cons: Food takes some time to reach the table

Overall: I'll see you shortly! In love with this spot. I can come here alone, with a friend or even with a date! It's great for all occasions!"}
{"text":"I visited this location and ate the Roasted Vegetable Spaghetti (Add chciken breast)on the recommendation of the server. The meal was very good. The service from Amanda F was great, super friendly and very efficient. The atmosphere was pleasing, modern, and the dining area was clean."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!  I loved my flatbread and my friends loved their meals as well. Service was average. I haven't tried their dinner menu so I'll definitely be back to try that."}
{"text":"Happy Hour: 
Monday- Friday from 3pm-7pm 
Monday-Thursday 9pm-Close.
Special Menu of $2.95 items.

I finally made it here to try their \"Tuscan menu\", and had the beef carpaccio, burger, shrimp cocktail, bruschetta, flatbread.  The burger was a little dry but worth $3, everything else was great!"}
{"text":"I am not especially jazzed to be writing a review of Brio as it is more of a chain establishment; however, it has a couple of things going for it that elevate it a couple of inches above Wal-Mart, so I am doing it.

These things are atmosphere and tiny desserts. Let's start with atmosphere: the place is giant and perhaps bordering on tacky, but at least they tried, and they have probably the largest, most impressive patio in Las Vegas featuring not only tables but love seats and plenty of umbrellas. It must be at least a solid two blocks of outdoor experience. Of course, all of this is undermined by the fact that Town Square sits solidly underneath the flat path for McCarran, so every ten minutes you have a 757 flying over and rendering conversation impossible for about a minute. After about 15 minutes of this, my mom commented, \"I hope they got a good deal on this property.\" I would say this makes what could be a five star atmosphere a three star experience, possibly even two if you are sensitive to jet engines.

Yet, they have one more trick up their patio: tiny desserts. Really, this is a brilliant idea, and I am not sure why more restaurants do not do this. Brio offers six miniature desserts. They come in what is best described as a sweet shot glass, which is probably the volume of 3 shot glasses. Each mini-sweetie only costs $2.45! My mom and I had the Peachberry Crostada topped with pecan streusel, vanilla bean gelato and Melba sauce. My mom wanted to order five more, and I can't blame her.

We both had salad and soup for our lunch, and those were done well. They also have a nice happy hour, but you have to sit at the bar to get those deals. I recommend just creating your own secret happy hour: grab a table on the patio and order $2.45 desserts until your sweet tooth begs for mercy. It's a good plan."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The atmosphere is lively but a bit loud. We were seated close to an outside door, so it was cold whenever the door was frequently opened - overall 5 stars. Our server was Abby - she was great!, ask for her section :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch at BRIO today. Food was good as always. Unfortunately it was freezing inside the restaurant. We noticed that three large double doors were open to the outside patio where two guests were having lunch under two large space heaters. We asked our waitress, then the hostess and then the manager if they could close some or all the doors. We were advised that the fire code REQUIRED that all three doors remain open if there were any guests on the patio. Seemed strange. After more guests inside complained about the temperature (61 degrees) in the restaurant they closed one of the doors. Still freezing. Seems that the manager lied to us about the fire code or he broke it when he shut one of the doors. Does anyone know?

By the way as we left we noticed another restaurant next door where people were eating outside on their patio under heaters and none of their doors were open."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Great patio seating and if it's a hot day seating in the patio I recommend seating there at night time. Food is good and service is excellent. Food selection is plenty even if you are vegetarian, pescatarian, carnivore, whatever over acting wanna be healthy not really you are... there is a food item here for you. Okay... ambiance haaaa, good vibe. And there are plenty of wine and cocktails to choose from too. You can burn everything you eat afterwards by walking around the shops in the area. I recommend this place. Happy Italian eating nom noms! :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed! With a reservation we still had to wait 15 minutes for the table. Once escorted to the table there was foid spilled and left over from before on the carpet. I guess they don't clean in between customers. Someone had a food fight before we sat. Out of six dishes , three pasta dishes were okay. The other three , one was sent back to the kitchen and the other two were nothing to write home about. In between the appetizers and salad, we had to pile up the dirty dishes in the middle of the table to make room and finally ask the waiter to please take it away. Not impressed and will not go back!"}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times since my last review, and I no longer feel like it's too crowded. Food is excellent and service is superb. I definitely recommend the pasta brio!!!"}
{"text":"My wife had a friend visiting from out of town so last night we decided to go out to eat at Brio.  My wife had eaten there once several years ago and my wife had purchased some Brio gift cards at Costco.

We were very disappointed in the food.  For a fancy restaurant we expected a lot better.

I ordered the Chicken Milanese, which is basically Chicken Parmesan.  The chicken is sliced very thin and then breaded and fried until it is quite tough.  It's probably over-fried.  3 weeks ago I had a root canal with a permanent crown attached 10 days ago.  I was seriously scared that chewing this chicken would knock my crown off.

My wife got the Balsamic Braised Short Rib.  She liked her meal and because she liked it, this rating is 2 stars and not 1 star.

My wife's friend got one of the pasta dishes.  I'm not sure which one.  But much of the pasta was all stuck together. into a solid lump.  She only ate part of the meal.  She complained to the waiter who told her that that's how the pasta should be because the sauce forces the pasta to stick together.  But after he cleared the plates, we could see the waiter showing the plate of pasta to someone from the kitchen.  Soon the manager came out to our table explaining that the pasta was over-cooked and offering to get her more pasta.  She declined as we had already finished our meal and had been in the restaurant an hour and a half by that point.  The manager wasn't offering to bring her the same dish prepared right, but  just some more pasta.  Like she wants to eat some pasta by itself.

The manager said he'd give us a discount on our bill for the bad pasta dish.  When we got the bill, it was an insult...  a $3 discount on a $79 bill.  When something bad is served and the manager admits it was prepared wrong,  it should have a greater discount.  With this insult, it would have been more respectful to have not offered any discount and just let us believe the quality of the food is bad.  Now we know the quality of the food is bad and the manager is disrespectful.

And I didn't even mention how bad my Chicken Milanese was.

But my wife was happy with her meal and one thing I've learned in my marriage is if my wife is happy, then I'm happy."}
{"text":"When I am in Vegas I always make it a point to stop at Brio once or twice for either lunch or dinner!  The Tuscan style decor is awesome!  Like you are in an old Tuscan vastly, with super high ceilings.

If you like a frozen drink, the peach Bellini is the best frozen concoction I've ever had hands down!

They have a salad on their lunch menu that is bomb!  The Romano crusted chicken salad.  Basically, mixture of fresh greens, kale, romain, cucumber, quinoa, feta and a few other ingredients.  Along with two crusted chicken breasts.  It is amazing.  Service is always fast and upbeat!

5 stars"}
{"text":"As a rule I'm not a fan of chain-restaurants. It's kind of a thing with me. 

Brio is one of the rare exceptions. I LOVE this place. Great atmosphere and service ...and of course, GREAT food! A+ anytime you go. 


They have an outstanding happy hour deal for small plates and drinks from 3-7pm in the bar area. 

Some of my favorite dishes there include the Beef Carpaccio, Pork Chops, and beef tips. The sides and flavors are always on point. 

It is a bit pricey for such a cooky cutter experience (as apposed to a unique high end or boutique dining experience) but it has a comfortable consistency. 

Whenever I'm hungry at Crocker Park or Legacy ..Brio is my jam. Lovely patio during nice weather too!"}
{"text":"Consumption of Italian food is one of my favorite pastimes, and I've found Brio to be a pretty good spot to do that.  It's location within Scottsdale Quarter, which does not have the best parking situation, is really the only negative here.

I'm usually coming here for dinner, and most recently we treated ourselves to a bruschetta sampler plate as an appetizer.  It came with three different variations, three pieces each, and all were spectacular.  I especially like the mozzarella and red pepper.  The bread was crunchy and the mozzarella was pure deliciousness!

For my entree I went with the Lasagna Bolognese.  Portion size was great.  I find a lot of places usually skimp on the meat with these dishes, but this one had a lot, which was fantastic.  There was a little too much cream based sauce topped over it for me, but that is a relatively minor complaint.

All in all I've enjoyed every meal I've had here, and I'm sure I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"I was at Brio on 9/25 and Joey was our server. He made the entire experience, I've never been so impressed by a waiter or waitress in my life. He seemed like he really wanted us to enjoy our dinner. Aside from the excellent customer service, the food is remarkable. If you are ever at Town Square definitely check out Brio!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Happy Hour! The Caprese salad is to die for. I've only been here for happy hour but what I've experienced service-wise is top notch. Will definitely be bringing friends so they can be wowed too!"}
{"text":"This absolutely earned 5 stars from my husband and I. The food, the service, the atmosphere were all outstanding. The beef medallions with shrimp were served with vegetables that were perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned, and accompanied by a rice pilaf that is every bit as delicious as Mama makes."}
{"text":"We have been to Brio several times with the kids and I am been to Brio soooo many times on my own.  And here is a hint, take the kids with you and share the food that is served for the kids.  The portions are huge for children and half the price of adult entrees.  While my husband and I did not do this the two times we have taken the kids, we keep joking that \"next time\" we are going to do just that!  The food is consistent.  I typically hate chain restaurants, but I will make a slight exception for Brio, if I am craving the lobster bisque."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work. Came across this  restaurant after a 15 mile bike ride in the desert. Food was awesome, wait staff was excellent, I think my waiters name was Michael.
Will be back on  my next trip."}
{"text":"I had an incredibly lovely weekday lunch here. Their lunch specials, while not cheap are filling and delicious. I had one of the paninis and was quite pleased. The atmosphere is nice, and the outdoor patio looked awesome. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"As my wife and I are partial to Italian food we gave this restaurant a try. We found the interior brightly decorated but a bit noisy. The restaurant was very busy at an early dinner hour (~6:00).
We had the foresight of having made a reservation, however. Our service from Jazmine was quite good throughout our visit. I ordered the Pesce Picatta and the wife ordered a chicken dish with pasta. Her meal was very good. My seafood was either overcooked or prior frozen, or both. It was very chewy and hence, disappointing. On the positive side, the manager came by and laid a complimentary sampler of bruschetta on us - a nice surprise. All in all, the experience was less than I was expecting from what appears to be a popular restaurant."}
{"text":"The spicy shrimp and eggplant is an addictive appetizer. You will come back! If you are looking for a patio seat, ask for the patio by the bar.. not crowded. Great night out and romantic setting with awesome service!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch after walking the mall or to even make the trip solely to come here! 

Tuscan inspired food with well developed flavors and plenty of attention to detail in the presentation as well as the preparation. 

To start, the bread... oh my... the bread!  Warm bread with perfection when it comes to the outer crust vs. soft inside ratio.   I should mention that there was also a crispy flavored flat bread  but honestly, I just could not get passed the Italian bread and butter!

We shared the Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip
 Served bubbling hot with Parmesan flatbread  ($8.95).   It was good, pretty standard restaurant dip but the flat bread served with it definitely kicked it up a notch. 

I enjoyed the Pasta Pomodoro with Chicken
 Angel hair with grilled chicken, tomatoes, pine nuts and a cilantro pesto drizzle ($13.65).  It was fresh with the chicken prepared and seasoned well.  The flavors complimented each other very well and made the dish satisfying but not overwhelming.

My companion had the Brio Bistecca Burger*
 With bacon, Provolone, lettuce, roasted tomato mayonnaise and Pinot Noir onions. Served with housemade chips. ($12.35) (sub fries for the chips)  Yes, a burger and fries at an Italian restaurant!  He seemed very impressed with it and commented several times that it had really good flavor. 

Service:  Very helpful, extremely pleasant and very accommodating.  

I should mention, if you sign up for their email club you receive a free meal of Steak and shrimp scampi for your birthday.  Being that I don't eat red meat and don't like shrimp they allowed me to substitute my entree for that.  By the way... definitely worth signing up for the email club! :)

Love this place whether for a casual lunch or would be a great date place too!"}
{"text":"the food was exceptional and the waiter was awesome...everything was timed perfectly...my wife said her chicken was one of the best dishes shes ever had...i had the lobster and shrimp linguini...excellent...the strawberry shortcake was fresh and very tasty...definitely would go again"}
{"text":"Brio
You made me order way too much good food
Highlights:
Tomato Mozzarella Flatbread- yummers
ITALIAN wedding meatball-yessers
Chicken Pomodoro and Milanese- ok I eat a lot of chicken, and I will always prefer chicken. BOTH of these dishes are great

Dessets- I love chocolate anything and all their mini desserts are awesome

This place is always packed but they seat you pretty fast.

I can't wait to come here again, very nice, romantic and lots of good looking people come here

THE END :)"}
{"text":"Trying to be nice since we moved from the Columbus, Oh, the home of Brio/Bravo/Lyndeys(founder) etc.

In the few months we have been here, we have had dinner, carryout and happy hour.   It does not seem to be the same quality food and attention to detail in any of the 3.  The worst is the \"happy hour\" food which per other posts is inferior quality.  The portions are just right and the prices are great but if the food sucks so what's the point?   Also, they broadcast Happy Hour but the bottle of wine was full price and we were not given other choices.The carpacio is always excellent and not bad at happy hour as well but everything else is salty, greasy and lacks the freshness and zip that I can't believe I am saying, from the midwest locations."}
{"text":"Went with my wife and 3 yr old daughter.  The greeter highly recommended the Pasta alla Vodka, so we split that along with a Bruschetta Sampler and lobster tail.  For the kid, she got a cheeseburger with fries from the kids menu.

The decor is great.  Kinda reminds me of Cheesecake Factory.

The service was good.  The waitress brought out some dough on a plate for our daughter to play with.

The Pasta alla Vodka was great!  Slightly spicy which I enjoyed.  We did like the Bruschetta of course.  Wife said lobster tail was ok.  

Surprisedly the kids cheeseburger was adult size.

It was a pricey dinner but we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"You cant go wrong with Brio, I have been to both locations Rampart and Town Sq and they have a good happy hr menu along with a lunch/dinner menu.. if you are looking to eat dinner at one of these locations, I recommend making reservations. Service is always on point and there is always something for everyone with in your party.."}
{"text":"Brio has a fantastic happy hour with everything $2.95 and drinks resonably priced!
You can get a hamburger, pasta, pizza, artichoke dip, caprese, etc. 

It is worth going early to find a nice spot in the bar since seating can be limited!"}
{"text":"Loved our food but what made the date night special was Meagan!  We asked her opinion on all of our choices & she was spot on each time.  She even recognized that my 2nd Cucumber/Basil Gimlet looked wrong but had me try it before taking it back.
She made our once another outing great.
The food oh yeah the food was fantastic!  Pasta Pesto was so light & perfect for a hot night & my hubby's was heavier, beef & pappardelle but oh so yummy.
Thanks Brio for making our evening away from a toddler so awesome!"}
{"text":"First, I have to admit this place ain't cheap. However, the experience was very good.

1. Food was good. I had Lobster bisque and a Lobster and shrimp fettuccine. No complaint.

2. Service was excellent. My uncle's lamb chop was over cooked, they pleasantly replaced it right away and offer a lobster bisque while he waits. Excellent service.

3. Wine price mark up is also reasonable. But you can't bring your own wine."}
{"text":"Caprese was excellent. Delicious tomatoes and nicely portioned mozzarella. Had the frittata for brunch and although good, there were so many rich components.  Ask for the Alfredo sauce on the side. Service was okay. The general environment felt a little unorganized and off."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite places for Italian food!!! Such a good fancy dinner for a reasonable price. Our waitress Samantha was clearly trained well and super personable. She did such a great job and made the experience fantastic!"}
{"text":"Place is nice and big. Service is pretty top notch and their food is pretty good. Be aware that you might spend a good amount, but don't worry. Their quantities were pretty good."}
{"text":"A step up from the typical Italian chain restaurant.  The food was very good, the service excellent, and the ambiance very nice.  Had the pork chops for dinner and the apple crisp for desert based upon a friend's recommendation.  Glad I did because was one of the best chops I had in awhile."}
{"text":"Happy Hour visit. Return trip, the prices are half off so you can't beat that. The mini burgers were tasty, the carpacio also very good. I get it with all the stuff on it and its always been amazing. Also had a taste of the shrimp and zucchini (get it unbreaded). The Blueberry Martini also very good, had two (hey its Happy Hour). After all that was actually quite full, The bill was about $20. The atmosphere was good, we sat at the bar so we can talk with the bar staff who are very pleasant. Miss out gal Lara though what used to be there she was always awesome and knew what you wanted."}
{"text":"This was my very first experience at Brio and I had heard really good things about them.  We were promptly greeted and seated immediately. We did have reservations so I'm sure that helped because on a Saturday evening this place was busy.  Our waitress was great in explaining the specials and anything we had a question about on the menu. Prior to our meal we were served a bread basket which had a nice sized piece of warm sourdough bread and real butter. It was really good. We decided on Peach Bellini's and they were delicious. We also had lobster bisque, which had a bite of lobster in every spoonful. Next the entrees were served.  We had the Brio pasta, Salmon and asparagus with a crab cake, and the lasagna bolognese. All were delicious. We had a temperature problem with the crab cake but it was immediately corrected. An awesome dinner and a beautiful dinner area made for an amazing first time. I will return."}
{"text":"Very disappointed by Brio last night. Had horrible service from the get-go when entertaining clients. 2 different parties of 4 who came in after us got served drinks long before we did. After we brought this to the attention of our waitress she was extremely unapologetic and in fact showed a markedly soured attitude towards us after that. We flagged down an also unapologetic seem-to-be manager, who first pointed to our waters joking that we \"did have our drinks\" and then got very busy describing how he kept glancing over at us during his walk thrus and everything seemed okay... weird that he was so defensive. His (wrong) \"impression\" is besides the point. .. He offered to \"buy us the round\" but never checked on us again. In fact,  we had to ask that the drinks be taken off when the increasingly snarky waitress didn't know a thing about it when presenting us with the check. All in all bad, unfriendly, non-empathic and disrespectful customer service. No fun to encounter flippant staff with an attitude. I will be telling my friends about this experience."}
{"text":"An upscale Italian restaurant.  Today a group of  us decided to try Brio's brunch out and we were pleasantly surprised.  The breakfast side of the menu was very small, yet simple. It contained the typical eggs, potatoes and bacon dish.  However, the brunch side of the menu contained a number of their top selling menu items.  They also have a small brunch section of paired drinks as well."}
{"text":"The Bottom Line: Great service with decent food and a nice atmosphere make Brio a good place to grab lunch or dinner with friends.

Try:
Pasta Alla Vodka
Mushroom Ravioli Di Bello

Pro:
With quick, friendly service and a well appointed interior, Brio makes a great first impression. The food itself was flavorful and substantive, and you definitely feel like you get your money's worth. 

Con:
No big cons to think of! It's a solid place."}
{"text":"A group of seven of family went to Brio for a birthday/reunion get together. The meals we had ranged from pasta to pork/beef to fish. I had the beef medallions with a marsala mushroom gravy, which was excellant. The pasta, pork chops and braised beef short ribs were also liked. The pesca piccata was somewhat bland though. The appetizers we had were the eggplant topped with shrimp and the calamari. They were large servings and very delicious. Good wine, good food and good coversation was had by all. The resturant has a large dining room with adequate seating for larger groups all the way down to couples and family dining."}
{"text":"First time dining, wow the ambience is beautiful, takes you to another world... food is sub-par, bread was very good. Wedge salad, the dressing was just ok. Don't get the lasagna, WTF! Creamy on top not your traditional layered lasagna and the ground meat was more like mush, no flavor. 
Service is clueless. Mistake after mistake. 
Maybe great for tourists, families and non-foodies."}
{"text":"Brio is really relaxing, elegant and has excellent food.  You will enjoy looking at the kitchen in the distance and the buzzing of the location and its staff. Its big enough to get in typically very quickly.  The prices are very competitive for the quality and location.  And you are right in Crocker Park to then, before or after, window shop or check out some of the stores."}
{"text":"Best happy hour I've been to yet! Awesome prices, generous portions, tasty dishes, and yummy white peach sangria."}
{"text":"second time here
 the salad is great
service is fine
not too expensive for somewhat formal dining"}
{"text":"The food was so yummy and served in good sized portions. The price is very affordable. The place is very nice and has great customer service. I definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner for friends, dates, or for the family."}
{"text":"Our food was good, atmosphere was nice it was an early dinner so not that crazy busy. Overall I would definitely like to go here again. I had the Pene Alla vodka which was very good and we shared the beef carpaccio which was delicious! My cousin had the steak and my sister in law had the carbonara which she really enjoyed."}
{"text":"Surprised I never wrote a review. I'm going to be forward only go for happy hour. It's amazing besides that I went to the dining area last week and the entree's were not fresh and  my server ordered the wrong entree from me and I was hungover so I was starving and wasn't thrilled to wait 10 more minutes. My salad was bitter and lots of brown lettuce and it was not good at all. Like I said only go for happy hour.

PROS: Happy hour, decor, ambiance
CONS: service, salads, beef tartare not fresh, mahi mahi dry"}
{"text":"I keep trying every here and there when a friend wishes to go.  Another chain restaurant as if we aren't saturated enough with these in this town.  No matter the time of day or evening, whether or not I am in the bar or patio area or even the dining area the service is mediocre.  Always inattentive bartenders, and the bar only had a total of four people there including myself and my friend!  Until a try it again next year (I usually wait a year).  I will stick with my regular haunts for TS (town square) Killer Shrimp, Tommy Bahamas and Double Helix.  Always friendly and attentive service there;)"}
{"text":"Accommodating hostess Kylie and the most wonderful and helpful server, Jessica, we've ever had!  She made a suggestion for just a little more food knowing we were already full on appetizers, which were already out of this world, to try the lobster bisque soup. Yum. We will definitely come back to this location again."}
{"text":"Visited on Valentine's day. This place was pack and it didn't seam like things where being handled very well. Well we didn't know that the system went down and they just needed an extra min to get a work around plan together. After being seated we had Jennifer as a server. Super nice gal. We've never been in a place where the sense of urgency was so high. The food runner was actually running at some points, (it was scary) managers where bussing food as well. For it being so busy the food came out with perfect timing and tasted fantastic. Huge applause to the guy who was bussing the food out way to hassle I hope the waiter take care of you."}
{"text":"First time dinner experience last night at Tivoli Village with family made my day. 
Serving staff were wonderfully helpful and with 8 of us and a vegetarian nearly everyone chose different items from the menu. Not a complaint anywhere. The service, Food, Wine and Tiramisu for dessert. Everything was exceptional and the portion sizes were very generous in every dish. 
Will be back very soon. Thanks for creating a beautiful family evening memory."}
{"text":"Everything that I have had here is great.  I've had 5 things and tasted a bunch of others.  They do pasta right and have great service.

The little desert cups are a fantastic idea.  I can get something good and sweet that is small!  Other restaurants expect you to commit to a $12 piece of cake the size of your head right after eating a big meal."}
{"text":"Frequent here often... great food... great service...nice Italian dinner that won't bruise your wallet..."}
{"text":"Brio is very good especially for the price. The lemon chicken is excellent service is good staff is mostly friendly. Bartenders pour a good drink especially if you are sitting at the bar and are specific about what you want (strength of drink and what not)"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere.  However,  the food per dollar value was not there.  It was tasty, don't get me wrong. I just expect to be full when I spend this much."}
{"text":"We come here all the time for happy hour and normally have amazing service.  However this time we had Danny R as our server.  He failed to refill waters after asking a few times.  Was to busy chatting with servers to drop a glass of wine at our table while holding it for at least 5 mins.   Asked us 30 mins after we got our food if it was ok bc we didn't eat much of.  Then we waited another 10 mins for our bill.  All in all the service this time was subpar to previous visits.

After note I speak with the manager he credited the bill back."}
{"text":"Food is average or less than average. Pastas are all a little oily. Had a reservation, showed up five minutes before res time, still waited an hour and 15 minutes for a table. That alone prevents me from ever going back. It's dishonest. Food took almost 45 minutes to come out. Their consolation? A free desert. No thanks--we were ready to get out of there after 2 and a half hours. Our waiter was polite and did everything we could. We tipped well and we move on with no hard feelings, but a lesson learned."}
{"text":"We come here often with family and the portions are generous. The flavors are authentic Italian and they will customize a dish if there's something you don't like. We had the pork chops, which were excellent, and the ravioli. Their meat dishes are actually better than the pasta. Of course we also love the appetizers, especially the calendar, which is flaky and not rubbery."}
{"text":"The customer service I experienced at the San Tan Brio was phenomenal. There was an issue with my entree and the waiter immediately picked up on it. He sent the chef out to apologize and re-cook my food. The Manager also came over, apologized, and comped our appetizer and entree without us even asking. They really did a great job taking care of my group."}
{"text":"There are few places I can eat in Vegas any time of the day no matter what I'm in the mood for and this is one of them.  

Their Happy Hour menu in my opinion is the best! It's inexpensive and full of options."}
{"text":"Sliced Steak Salad and Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant are a MUST. Service is great as always- ask for Amanda she is super nice and attentive!"}
{"text":"Great, refined quality of food. Friendly service. So-so prices. Not so Italian.

The reason I gave Brio a 3 star rating is because they don't have traditional Italian pizzas! This shocked me and put me off quite a bit. I'm 100% Italian and for an Italian restaurant not to have traditional pizzas is just a huge no-no. Like a burger joint that doesn't serve burgers and fries. However, they do have 4 choices of American style flat-breads that can be ordered on pizza dough. But it's just not the same. 

I've been here before and the other few dishes I've tried are very tasty. Although, I do not consider this to be an Italian restaurant. More of an American take on Italian cuisine. Still good but not what I was looking for."}
{"text":"Brio has never done me wrong.  We go here all the time and it's always good. Thank you for being so consistent.  My fave starters.   Lobster bisque and blue cheese wedge salad.   The healthy menu item with the chicken and quinoa is so good."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from Sarah at the bar! She is so funny & friendly. All our food was delicious! Definitely coming back here again soon."}
{"text":"Service was good, however we made a reservation for 11 people at 5pm but were informed upon arrival that happy hour pricing is only available at the bar or outside (105 degrees) and although there was plenty of seating in the bar area our large group would not be able to actually sit together and enjoy each other's company from multiple tables. So we sat outside dripping in sweat until we couldn't take it anymore. Sorry Brio, your loss. Luckily Double Helix can accommodate our group and happy hour is until 7:30!"}
{"text":"Great food , the salmon was to die for.
The waiter was informative and had a stupid attitude when we had questions ,good price  4 star since it was my first time here and I hate rude and very unfriendly waiter"}
{"text":"We were so excited to have Brio come to Summerlin.  We decided to give it a shot and thought we would have to wait for seating.  We were very pleased we did not have to wait long at all.  We were impressed with the menu selection and had heard many great things.  This set our expectation high.  The food was good we ordered steak and pasta.  The service however was lacking.  Our water glasses were not checked and we were seated right next to the kitchen.  The manager was on her cell phone in the open kitchen having an emotional conversation and the staff did not appear to help each other out.  One of the waitresses was crying and two appeared to be angry at each other.  We highly value service and on our visit it was lacking.  By the end of the meal we were discussing that we would have enjoyed a meal at Carrabbas more.  It may have just been the evening we decided to go and we have discussed giving Brio another try, it wasn't bad but it was only OK and we were hoping for WOW!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a ton of reviews so I'll make it quick. This is one of the best italian restaurants in the area and they are consistent.

Amazing bread/crackers? CHECK! Amazing service? CHECK! AMAZING food? CHECK CHECK CHECK!

This is the best italian food I think I've ever had and this is the premier restaurant I will take guests to."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised. The food is excellent. I got the crabcakes (crab and shrimp) and they were awesome. My wife got a chicken dish where the chicken was breaded and skewered over mashed potatoes (don't know the name of the dish) and it was a ton of food.

My only complaint, but it was a minor one due to a pet peeve of mine is that our server seemed a little aloof. Never around when I actually wanted him to be. Not sure where he was since the kitchen area is all open so you can you the server's stations, etc. I think we could have been out of their 10-15 minutes sooner had he been around. It wasn't just at the end of our meal, but also during. Seemed kind of weird for the type of establishment. I still give it 4 stars and will for sure try it again, but may have to change my rating if I end up having a similar experience."}
{"text":"I am definitely a foodie, therefore it was hard for me to write thie review. The food itslef was beyond stellar! I had the Shrimp crusted salmon with Quinoa. The appetizers were amazing as well. So why only 1 star? The service... We had a party of 7, and the waiter took forever to take our order. we sat there starving ffor 30 minutes before they took our order. The place was beautiful, but yet dirty. They weren't eager to clean off tables, it was food and things on the floor. I was dissapointed for such a beautiful establishment to be so dirtly.

Lastly, the waiter knocked over an entire glass of water inside my purse ice and all... He handed me a napkin, apologize and that was it. I was there cleaning out my purse, trying to get the ice out. He never mentioned it again, checked if I was okay, nor tried to help me clean my LV $1236 purse. I was pretty disappointed. The only good thing was the food, and the decor. The service, cleanliness, and staff are not nearly up to the level of expectation of the environment, and or the food."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Brio Tuscan Grille since they've opened up at Town Square eons ago. I know, I like to write my reviews late. Even when I relocated for three years, whenever I visit Vegas, I would always have dinner at least once at Brio. I would always suggest Brio as an option to my out of town friends. And more than once did we celebrate birthdays with dinner at Brio. 

Honestly, I've never really had a horrible experience at Brio. If we had any issues with our meals, once we bring it up with our server, they'd always manage to get it fixed right away. One of my most recent visits to Brio, our waitress was a blast -- we had a lot of fun kidding around with her. 

However, I am a little sadden by the fact that a few menu items have changed, such as the steaks. They no longer offer the surf and turf or just a filet mignon with veggies dishes. Though the steak dishes they have right now are still pretty good. I gotta say, the price you pay is a whole lot better than what you pay for if you eat at the strip. Brio has awesome prices (even though the prices have gotten bumped up within the past three years). 

It can get loud while dining in though. There are tons of people talking, laughing, etc. But it never really bothered me. 

As for what to get to eat at the Brio? I'd say try anything you want. Everything I've tried was very good. Some of my favorites are the steaks, rack of lambs, and the carbonara. I also enjoy their bruchetta a lot. One of my favorite drinks at the Brio has got to be their peach bellini -- it's always so yummy!!! Don't be afraid to try anything there :)"}
{"text":"Brio is DEFINATELY one of our favorite restaurants to go to be it brunch on the weekend, lunch or dinner anytime. The quality of the food is very high and the service is excellent from the time you enter until you leave  
Matthew, the manager, is now like an old family friend. He was the reason we started coming to Brio. We were out looking for a place to lunch and were browsing the outdoor menu when he came out, highly recommended a couple of appetizers, telling us we wouldn't be disappointed and invited us in. He was so right!  But, to be invited in was like someone you knew inviting you into his home. We've been fans ever since.
Food is very consistent every time. We get emails telling us of specials and get a birthday entree free!  
The bar area is great and that menu is awesome!!  
Gotta love this place."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night to celebrate my birthday and sat on the patio. Service was sooooooo slow. I don't mind spending a decent amount of money for a good dining experience but it doesn't matter how good your food is when your server doesn't seem to care, is overloaded with tables and you can't get a water refill. Such a major let down, especially on my birthday."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour and could not have asked for a better experience. It is worth mentioning, however, that happy hour usually PACKS the bar area... and in our case had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. If you are planning to come here for HH, show up right at the start so you can get a table right away.

We enjoyed some white peach sangria, mango mojitos, and appetizers, all of which were great. The spicy shrimp and Brio burger are by far the best dishes, but anything on the menu will be great for sharing at the table. Next time you are looking for an early dinner or share some drinks with friends, do stop by this awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a great spot to hang out with your friends and enjoy great drinks and tasty food. I normally visit during their happy hour (M-F, 4pm to 6pm) when their prices and portions are quite generous. Here is my happy hour breakdown.

Ambiance: High energy and BUSY!! Their bar area is spacious but plan on waiting for a table if you are not there right at 4pm. 

Service: Fast and friendly... The way it should be! 

Food: AMAZING! Their $3.95 dishes are tasty and come in large portions. Do not leave their happy hour without trying their burger or the shrimp and eggplant dish... You will be sure to love them!

Drinks: The mojitos and sangrias are awesomely refreshing... Depending on the bartender. I wish they were more consistent with their flavor profile and alcohol content of their cocktails. In fact, their drink unpredictability is why I give them 4 stars. 

I will most definitely visit again and again!"}
{"text":"We arrived last Friday, 4/21 at 4:30 & seated ourselves outside.  This was to begin my partner's birthday celebration which always goes on for 5 days (like mine).  The place was very busy & had a few new servers; thus, we waited too long for our water & drinks.  In fact, the couple next to us received their drinks before us.  So, while my partner went to inquire, the food arrived (shortly after my wine)...   beef carpaccio, cheeseburger & the mozzarella salad.  He returned to the table with Chef Mike who profusely apologized & proceeded to take care of us with the old favorite eggplant shrimp.  If you've not tried that, do treat yourself !

The special surprise was birthday TIRAMISU which we gobbled down in 3 minutes because it was sooooo good!  And all the other food was equally as delicious.  I love the addition of that mozzarella salad which is substantial and, unlike 90% of the other happy hours in town, is a healthy menu item.

Our new server, Ashley, is from Oregon & a wonderful new staff member.  Chef Mike is from upstate New York & loves fishing, which subject will quickly engage him.

We've been frequenting Brio's since its opening and all these years have rarely, only rarely been disappointed.  With this little glitch, how can we complain?"}
{"text":"I went to Brio 3 times already so this review is long due.
I was always very pleased with the prices, variety, quality, the smaller plates menu, mini desserts...

I came here once with my bff and twice with chris before his bball games (he likes to have a big plate of pastas first for energy)

I always have smaller plates from the low carb menu,
My favorites are so far: beef carpaccio, lobster bisque, shrimp Mediterranean on orzo and spinach bed and mini creme brulee served in espresso cup! The tiramisu is very good too, it's my friend's favorite!
The shrimptini is just ok, the shrimps were small and a bit watery but the shrimps from the entrees are huge, nicely grilled and delicious.

The service was always great except one time when our waitress never refilled our iced teas until we asked for it again and again... Then had our refill finally when we paid our bill. Not cool. I am not asking for extra attention,  just for drink/water during my meal.

The service the other times was perfectly on point and everybody else was very friendly.

So we will come back tomorrow night for sure and I will make sure to update my review by then."}
{"text":"Lunch (soup and a salad) for under $15.  The service was very good and the food was excellent.  We will be back"}
{"text":"So the inside looks like Cheesecake Factory.  The servers were friendly enough.  One of our guests just wanted water and was asked by another server and the manager if she needed anything to drink.  Attentive, but kind of annoying.  
The bruschetta I tried was tasty.  The bread was more soft than crusty, which is what I like.  I'm not a fan of bruschetta  that tears up the roof of my mouth, so they got props for that.  The florentine reminded me of spinach dip.  I also tried one with prociutto, figs, and asparagus.  I think they should have cut the asparagus in half to cover the bread rather than run down the center.  It was still good.
I was brought a chopped salad, but I ordered a Ceasar.  The food runner tried to convince me that I actually ordered the chopped.  This is a pet peeve of mine.  It's ok to make mistakes; just correct them.  Don't try to convince me I've lost my mind and can't remember what I said 15 minutes before.  The food runner seemed to have drank about 13 Red Bulls before his shift; so that may have had something to do with his intensity to force chopped salad on me.
They definitely took the name of the restaurant literally when creating their food.  My pork chop tasted like the grill.  It was weird.  It reminded me of when you cook a hot dog on a grill for longer than a minute and it's covered in black.  My pork chop tasted like the grill burns.  The mashed potatoes and asparagus were good.  Nothing to write home about.  
They set down food 3 other times to try to serve us that was meant for other tables.  We all said if they did it one more time we'd just take it and ask for a box.  I don't know that I would care to eat it though.
If you're looking for a place to dine in the Kierland Corrider, you have many many better options to select."}
{"text":"Worse meal I've ever had. After a hard week at work, I was hoping for a nice meal to relax.  Was told their salmon is no longer fresh but farm raised,  server told us not to try their cod.  We ordered the fish and chips.  It came greasy, dipped in oil, and my husbands portion was partly frozen,  we were told it was fresh.  Yeah, freshly frozen.  I was afraid to order anything else but my husband opted for a cup of soup and I had the Caesars salad.  Part of the lettuce was wilted and couldn't eat it.  Hostess had the nerve to tell us we weren't charged for the fish and chips.  Why would we when it was so bad we couldn't eat it.   No care in their preparation and customer service sucked,  now I know why the place is empty but weeday nights. Horrible,"}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Great prices. What more could you ask from an Italian restaurant? They have almost everything you could think of Italian. From the various pasta dishes to the unique entrées to the unforgettable appetizers, this Italian restaurant stands out when compared to other Italian restaurants you may find around the city, especially Olive Garden. I was never a big fan of Italian food until I discovered this place. Definitely recommend this place if you're into something Italian."}
{"text":"I visited Brio a few weeks ago with my friend for lunch. She was actually my best friend from 5th grade in California and she moved away when we were in middle school and I hadn't seen her in 14 years! Anywho, she moved to LV last year and when I was in town visiting she hit me up for a mini reunion. 

My friend had been to Brio before and she suggest this place for lunch. This place looks really nice! Picture a step up from Cheesecake Factory. I can see a bridal shower or a special event being held here.

 I ordered the prosciutto and burrata pizza, it was delicious! For some reason I thought I tasted hints of fruit in the pizza sauce. I liked it though and I would get it again if I ever come back. 

We had a wonderful lunch catching up. Service was great, they give you nice warm bread upon seating. 

Overall it's a nice restaurant and I would recommend it for a nice lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Update:
Their happy hour is still great. I went back recently and sat outside on the couches. The appetizers have gone up in price to $3.95, but are still a great value. They now offer a happy hour drink menu for $5. I'll go back for their happy hour anytime. Still not crazy about their regular meals, but I'll probably give that another shot soon. 

I was sad to see that they changed their happy hour menu and took off the steak bruschetta, which was my favorite, but they still offer some fantastic options."}
{"text":"I like pork chops. I like salt.

And I like them not to have a sweaty orgy on my plate.

I get it, Brio, you like salt too. Guess what? I'm not a horse. Even though my penis will confuse you, I promise, I don't like salt enough to just show up, whinny, and start to canter because you knocked a tube of Morton's Iodized into your marinade.

Great ambiance, lovely vibe, VERY friendly waitstaff.

But that porkchop was saltier than a pirate's thighs."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour, great service, really nice outdoor area, no-charge valet parking very near, many little shops near."}
{"text":"Brio is a hit or miss. Living in Vegas we get spoiled by all kinds of foods and standards I must say this Brio is he best in town. Food delicious and very flavorful. Service not the best no matter the occasion they don't disappoint"}
{"text":"Came back with a friend and had dinner here. Ordered the pesto pasta dish. I must say for under 700 calories it was delicious - especially for it being pasta and all the yummy stuff that came in it. Tried the Strawberry Fresca alcohol drink and that was good. Would like to try the Peach Sangria next time. Had to order the spinach artichoke dip from my last visit. Was as good as I remembered it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I arrived today at 11am & was greeted with a warm welcome from the very tall hostess.  She was sweet & had a nice smile, too.  

We were seated within 5 minutes and our waitress seemed sweet, as well.  We ordered our food & i go the salmon w/ angel hair lunch entree.  I dont remember the exact name for it (but thats what it had).  Anyways, our food arrived and all I could see was how oily the pasta was. GAA-ROOSSS. Good thing, I was hungry and didnt eat any breakfast, yet. So i ate at least half of my entree, but  after eating all that oily pasta, I wanted to barf.  The salmon was cooked almost perfectly & I enjoyed it.  

The waitress was so great, either.  Though she seemed sweet she never came back to check on us and took forever getting the check to us.  I dont know if I would come back here again, since this is the second time I tried Brio but who knows, I think I might try it at least one last time.  Hopefully, the third time is a charm"}
{"text":"Of the two locations, this is the better. Happy hour is the only reason that brings me to Brio. For Italian food, there are better venues around Vegas. As for HH, this is one of the better. 

The offering of drinks tend to sway my judgement. The Town Square location lacks drink offerings. For $5, a decent size list of specialty cocktails has something for most. 

The two food items I ordered was enough to tide me over. The beef carpaccio with mixed greens is one of my regularly favorites. The shrimp with eggplant was a solid option as well. As an in between snack to banish hunger, a better deal is hard to come by. 

One drink and two appetizers for $14. Check please."}
{"text":"For happy hour, it is one of the best in Town Square. Monday-Friday 3:30-6:30 and Monday-Thursday 9-close. They have a set menu of certain appetizers for $2.95. A few of these dishes will make for a perfectly good meal. The special is only good for the bar and it is first come, first serve. Since the weather is getting chillier, it is easy to get a seat on the outdoor side. They close the curtains and turn on heat lamps, so it is not bad.

The offerings consist of Beef Carpaccio, Spinach Artichoke Dip, two styles of Flatbread, Fried Raviolis (3 large pieces), a Burger (cut into quarters for sharing), Spicy Shrimp with Eggplant, and Shrimptini (Shrimp Cocktail). The carpaccio was my favorite and so inexpensive.The burger was also good. It is very simple, topped with cheese and a special sauce with a few chips. I usually like mine with all sorts of veggies, but this was nothing to frown upon. The raviolis were the last item I had ordered and they were decent. Getting three of these dishes makes for a perfect dinner and will cost less then $10. 

I looked at the rest of their regular menu and many of the pastas were cream based or had it as a listed ingredient. I like my pastas to be on the lighter side, so I tend to skip on them here."}
{"text":"Still an awesome Happy Hour. Love their new $5 Martini Thursdays. Now I really won't be able to stay away."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to go for Lunch or  even Dinner.   First of all our waitress with her name as Cinnamon (whether that's her name or just a made up on), she's bad ass.  She was like a hawk with our refills, orders and the bill.  The whole team there at Brio works so in sync with each other, so dynamic, it was a nice calm melody, how they worked as a team. Management must be great here. 

Food was amazing 
The pizza for our daughter was so good. 
My wife got the Strawberry Balsamic Chicken Salad and that was amazing. 
I got the Lobster Bisque that was out of this world and the Campanelle Carbonara that was finger licking good!

Thank you guys, for an awesome lunch!"}
{"text":"This use to be my go to place when I lived in Gilbert. My favorite dish was the baked angel hair spaghetti with mushrooms and meat sauce. It's not on the menu, I always had to ask the server for it. They knew what I was talking about.

Lots of flavor and a large portion. 

I would come eat here more but it's so far from me now! 

Trendy spot to have brunch with friends or a romantic date night spot. Location in the Santan Village Mall."}
{"text":"The place has a beautiful design that would satisfy most occasions - from a romantic date to a nice family dinner.  

The food is what you'd expect from a borderline upscale chain with entrees priced between $20-30. The food won't blow you away, but none were disappointing. See pictures :)

The service, from the hostess to our waiter, could improve... a lot.  Our hostess forgot to seat us until we asked (probably due to a shift change). Our waiter was very, very inattentive... we never got complimentary bread, our water weren't refilled, and we felt he was inpatient with our orders... We always have a good time regardless of service (if the food is good), but I like to think, part of the reason for the overpriced food items is the good (or at least more attentive) service... or maybe I'm becoming too snobby.

Overall, my family and I had a good time!"}
{"text":"I haven't even started eating and this place has already giving me bad service. I made reservations for 2 and they placed me at a table for 6. Whats the fucken point for making reservations if we have to wait for our table. We'll see how that food taste. 
 
Ok after everything got all figured out I must say the food itself was AMAZING. The general manager of the restaurant was so accommodating."}
{"text":"This Brio location is my go-to spot for happy hour, lunch outside on a nice day, or a healthy dinner either with the girls or on date night. So basically, I'll come here anytime! I love to sit outside when it's nice out. Some of my favorites are their bread, the White Peach Sangria, Spicy Shrimp with Eggplant, and the Chocolate Lava Cake (it's called something else on the menu). I especially love the \"Lighter Side of Tuscany\" aka healthy menu- every item I've tried has been delicious. Come here, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Get yourself to Brio for their $2.95 Happy Hour specials!  Their HH is Mon-Thurs from 3:30 - 6:30.  The best day of the week to go is Thurs when they have $5 martini night.  All of the HH food is fantastic, especially the Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant and the Roasted Garlic, Spinach, Artichoke Dip.  Make sure to arrive early because HH is only served at the bar & lounge and seating fills up fast."}
{"text":"I wanted take out pasta for tonight, I had the choice to go either at Pizza California Kitchen either at Brio. Unlike California Pizza Kitchen, as soon I walked in I was greated with a smile from 2 polite and friendly hosts who didn't hesitate to go over the menu with me."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Vegas-meets-Cheesecake factory decor wise.  It's loud and kind of cheesy on the inside, although peeking out at the patio, it seems nicer out there (and quieter)  It's your run of the mill corporate restaurants.  The food is decent, the portions are enormous!  You can't really go wrong with the pastas here, although my angel hair was about 30 seconds over cooked.  My co worker had the lasagna and she wasn't a fan of it at all plus it looked pretty pathetic and way too cheesy.  They have decent lunch specials, and if you are just grabbing a bite when you are around the SQ it serves it's purpose for an average meal, at average prices."}
{"text":"My wife had to send back the house salad because it was soggy and tasted aweful. It was definitely sitting for a long time before service. The entrees were bland and uneventful. They looked delicious but there was a complete lack of flavor. The check was 50 bucks for two entrees, two salads, and two waters. At this price I would expect to get a meal with some flavor, and a fresh salad. Save some money go to Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch at Brio was even better than I thought it might be.  A little online research showed some promising entrees, but it was more than that.  The ambiance was perfect Sunday, even though we only had a lunch hour instead of the normal brunch experience.  Service was quick, and we had delicious bread and artisan crackers on our table before we could even order.
The brunch food is awesome.  I had my heart set on the vegetable omelet with egg whites, mushrooms, etc. (I was sold with the mushrooms) and my darling wife had the Sicilian Omelet, with ham, bacon, sausage, etc. - and the star of the whole meal by far was the tomato compote on top of her omelet.  That sauce made us think of Italy, and made us want to come back to try some pasta here, because it was the most flavorful, full-bodied tomato sauce we've ever had. It totally took over the omelet, but in a darn good way.
My white omelet was awesome, and I would get it again in a heartbeat.  But I'll try getting the tomato compote on it...  And maybe the brunch potatoes, which are also sublimely well done, not too crisp or soggy, not too salty or bland, just yum all around."}
{"text":"Brio was wonderful, great food at wonderful prices, the selection was great, everything tasted good, we ordered beef tartar that was humongous and tasty, and they white egg veggie omelet. The bread was hottttt and fresh and the butter was tasty the combo was dangerous lol 
Go there and check it out"}
{"text":"We just had a party in their group dining area. The staff went out of their way to make the food presentation beautiful. We ordered several appetizers, pasta, and a salad. From start to finish the customer service was excellent. Kayla and Matt returned emails and messages immediately during the planning of our event. I arrived almost an hour early to mildly decorate, and the staff was busy setting up tables and food warmers. I can't believe I was worried about the size of the fruit and vegetable platters, they were beyond expectation! The food was ready perfectly on time for our guests and our server Mark (a true professional) managed to keep 30 water glasses always full, and was there for our every need. I would recommend Brio for any event, thank you for making our baby shower so special! (I usually don't write reviews, but this was such a great experience I felt like I needed to!)"}
{"text":"went to visit vegas and stopped in here. wow is what I got to say. service was great, clean and elegant place, food was crazy good. crab cakes are to die for and the desserts yum! good prices as well. I do recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had the Espresso Rubbed ribeye and it was delicious. Cooked to a perfect medium-rare. Was actually very surprised how good it was. Go to fine dining strip Steakhouse's with my wife fairly often and this was just about as good and for only $32. Also had the lobster bisque, swordfish and a kids pizza. Food was good, service was good."}
{"text":"What can I say... I am not much of a \"chain\" kind of girl but this place never disappoints!!! I have never had a bad experience! Whether it is a casual luncheon, happy hour or full fledged dinner... Their food, drinks and ambiance is always spot on! Great happy hour specials by the bar. Amazing appetizers, flatbreads and drink specials. My absolute favorite is the spicy shrimp and eggplant. It is so much creamy spicy goodness! Oh lord have mercy!!! It is ridiculously yummy! Funny thing is... I am not crazy about shrimp and I'm not crazy about eggplant. Somehow this just works! Have also had carpaccio, pasta and the Gorgonzola crusted lamb. Everything has rocked!!! Also, awesome outdoor patio with plenty of misters and shade so one can sit and people watch outside. Fantastic drink specials as well!"}
{"text":"A wonderful first time experience here. As we often do on a first experience we over ordered and ALL WAS GREAT. I'm sure we will borrow some of their selection's to create at home.A separate menu with the specials included photos of each selection was appreciated. Nice touch with questions to our server Britney we let her guide us and she did not dissapoint. A nice conversation with manager Hanna about our anniversary made us feel like a regulars on our first visit. As it was Graduation night they were  accommodating all size party's with ease. Next visit we will sit outside. In all its delicious and charming."}
{"text":"Wow! NIGHT and DAY compared to the Brio in town square. They have great customer service and the food is also prepared better. I'm not sure why there is such a difference but I love it. I was pretty much done with Brio after many not so great visits to the other location. Thank God I decided to give this a try. Crystal you were wonderful! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Loved this place until today... Worst, rude service ever. This fake Australian ruined our date. He was so obnoxious and you could tell he didn't want to be there. 

Side note: Don't ever just assume you're going to get a bad tip because you mess up once... You could always make it better. Instead you made it worse!"}
{"text":"This is the short version of the longest review ever written...

I got married in Vegas June 20, 2008 and chose Brio for the after ceremony (reception?) dinner. I planned my entire wedding over the course of 3 weeks remotely from Colorado, so I didn't realize Brio was in a mall. I'm sure I could have figured that out if I'd read more reviews...

I ended up loving Brio! When we first arrived, we were told that our private room was not available due to the air conditioning unit going out inside and the room temp hovering around 90 degrees. I think when something goes wrong with a major reservation, the way the staff treats the issue is a true sign of their customer service skillz. Well folks, the staff at this Brio location has mad skillz, the skillz that pay the billz even!! They apparently left me a voicemail letting me know of the issue earlier in the night, but for some crazy reason, could be that I was exchanging vows and bling with the love of my life, I didn't get the msg. So anyway, they were very apologetic and seemed almost let down themselves that I didn't have the perfect room for my dinner on my wedding day....it was really okay though because I was at a very zen place right then and they were so nice about it. 

So, onto the meal. The staff had curtained off half of the regular dining area so we still had a private dinner, it was just a little louder around us than it would have been behind closed doors. Brio comped us two bottles of Champagne for our toast due to the room being unavailable and Chris, who was absolutely sweet and could not have been more attentive, waited on us hand and foot during our meal. He also provided sparkling orange juice for the kids and my sister in law who is expecting for the toast. The champagne was good, the bartender even came in and helped us pick out a few bottles of wine to drink with our meal which was nice. We all ordered right off the menu since there were only 14 of us. My son and I both had the Salmon which was served on parmesan crusted tomatoes and with shoestring potatoes, so delicious! My husband and step-son had the lamb chops and mashed potatoes - I don't like lamb but I tasted the mashers and they were seriously the best I've ever had. All in all, the food was scrumptious and prompt and the service was outstanding. 

The day after the wedding, I had a message from the manager at Brio, Kenna, that someone in my wedding party left something at the restaurant and she needed my address to send it to me. I waited a few days to receive whatever it was that was left there after I got back to CO. To my surprise, a package arrived with a letter from Chris and the staff at Brio thanking me for choosing them for my reception dinner. Included was the cork from our champagne bottle, that day's newspaper and the table covers that we had written on in crayon while enjoying our meal. So thoughtful and cute, the staff at Brio going above and beyond made the experience of my Vegas wedding that much more enjoyable! Grazie!"}
{"text":"Brio has the best happy hour in the city!  I love the atmospere and sitting outside, it makes me feel like I am not in Vegas. Love the option to sit at the bar inside or out!  3.95 for a wonderfully cooked burger?!! My husband loves the carpaccio, be sure to ask for extra sauce. They used to have a steak brushetta with Gorgonzola on the happy hour menu, I am sad its gone but they still have great selections, like my favorite spicy shrimp and eggplant, again ask for extra sauce.

 You can get a cocktail for 5 dollars as well! We usually stick to the martini, but have tried a few of there specialty cocktails and they were all good. We usually sit at the bar close to Del Mar, he is so awesome! He's busy and still manages to make us perfect drinks, he is always attentive and smiling and always gives outstanding service!! He's in my top 3 bartenders in Vegas! When in doubt of where to go, he keeps us coming back!! Such a great asset to the bar! This is one of my main reasons it's our fave happy hour!"}
{"text":"Happy hour specials are great :) that's what keeps us coming back. Service here is normally on point. Last weekend we definitely had a hiccup. 4:30 after work on Friday. We were brought appetizer plates that had already been used and a clean plate was put on top. I addressed it with the manager and he comped a couple of the appetizers. Service wasn't very good. We were on the patio and I had to go inside to request service twice. Bummer :( 

Food is delicious and I absolutely love Peroni. We will keep coming back for that. Hopefully service will be on point next visit."}
{"text":"We went here last night to try the restaurant and see what the new Tivoli Village was all about.  The complex is beautiful.  There was a live band playing in one one coutyards with people mingling and dancing.  Very cool.  If and when additional phases of this complex are completed, it will be a wonderful destination.

The restaurant carried the theme of the complex, with beautiful flooring, stonework and large spaces.  The vibe, ambience, seating and service were all excellent.  We had a 6:30 p.m. reservation and had to wait 15 minutes for our table, the only drawback to an otherwise perfect evening.

The wine was priced reasonably asnd the beer was ice cold.  We ordered the quartet of brushetta.  It was beautifully plated, visually appealing and delicious.  My wife had the penne alla vodka, which she really enjoyed.  I had the veal Marsala, with a very dark, rich sauce that was a bit too thick for my taste but otherwise excellent.

We look forward to going again."}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Very attractive and spacious restaurant.  Took a little while to get service but went great thereafter.  I felt like a salad and didn't look at the rest of the menu.  I had the Med. chicken salad....fresh, crisp, great textures and moist chicken.  My friend had the steak salad....beautiful thick pieces of medium rare steak.  Artisan bread to start.  Very enjoyable."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to Brio Tuscan Grille on vacation last week and were pleasantly surprised how enjoyable it was from the greeting when we came in until we finished the meal.  Our waiter Alex was very attentive and the food was extremely good.  We always look for the best restaurants when we travel and this one totally fit the bill.  We both had the Salmon with asparagus and sweet potatoes and it was delicious.  We also had the Caramel Mascarpone Cheesecake.  I would recommend this to anyone in the Gilbert, AZ area."}
{"text":"Adjust the temp! I love going there but not to freeze while I eat.  My food comes out hot and turns cold automatically because the air conditioner is on full blast. It's every time I go and I don't want to go back. The ladies next to me had to leave due to the chill as well. Come on... jeez!"}
{"text":"Spent my birthday here for lunch. I have a mixed bag rating for this place...there were things I did like: bread basket (flax seed crackers were good), calamari and white sauce and then things I didn't: turkey sandwich (see pic), chop salad (pic)......for your bday you get a very tiny dessert (very tiny like espresso shot cup size) - it was ok. Overall it was ok but I wouldn't rush back to eat there. Service was fine, nothing to brag about.  Honestly the best thing there was the flax seed crackers lol which was free.....I think is recommend eating there for HH instead of paying full price for their food."}
{"text":"I've never been much of a fan of happy hour....Reason being, I like to eat and generally Happy Hour mostly focuses around tiny portions, usually hit or miss, unpredictable or all of the above.

Well, I came out of my shell after being invited my friends to Brio Tuscan Grille for the best time of the day...First, my social life needs a little work so it felt good to be out and to mingle, but I won't lie to you - I went there for the food and I was far from disappointed.

The Brio Tuscan Grille Happy Hour menu is tiny...just  a couple of items. However, the service is very attentive and swift. I am basing my experience on a wonderful setting, match made in heaven weather, mind blowing prices, and absolutely scrumptious dishes...$ 2.95 really - I've got to call that the smoking deal of the century.

Brio you really wowed me, and not only did my social life get a little polished, but my taste buds also had an orgasm...what a way to kill two birds in one stone...Will be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I came to Brio for Sunday lunch and we were promptly seated. I ordered one of the restaurant favorites, the Mezza Chicken with pasta. Although the flavors of the marinara sauce were tasty and satisfying enough, it didn't blow me away. The lunch portion size left me quite disappointed since there wasn't as much pasta as I expected, especially for a pricey dish at $13. The service was pretty decent but the lackluster food and price doesn't give me an incentive to be back."}
{"text":"Hosted a group of 75, great food, great service! Had numerous positive compliments from our guest. Great job team Brio!!!"}
{"text":"Brio is a great place for happy hour. Tasting plates are $2.95.
The carpaccio and shrimp tini are awesome. Thursday is Martini night.
The bartenders and servers are very friendly and we always have a good time"}
{"text":"Excellent Happy Hour.  Food has always been consistanly good. The service is good. Nice atmosphere and prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"Served wrong food after 30 minutes of waiting and people around us who came after us got their food. This is just a big corporate chain, the employees really dont care. 

Eggs for my mother came out for a benedict almost completely raw. 

Ended up eating mediocre bread for lunch. I guess in the end this place is no better than an Olive Garden just more expensive."}
{"text":"Eaten here several times. Each time we have been pleased with the food. The Tuscan harvest salad is delicious. The waiters & waitresses are average and at times irritating due to lack of experience, poor serving and not checking on you. I would recommend this place to my friends and family. Just wish the service was better"}
{"text":"The setting and decor is beautiful.  So I can give it 3 stars for ambiance. The restaurant really has a nice feel and would be perfect if the staff were more attentive and the food faire was better thought out by the Chefs.  First, we were seated for 7 minutes before our server approached us.   Second, the temperature inside the restaurant was uncomfortably warm and stale.  Third, the meals.....My wife had the shrimp and lobster pasta.  We counted 6 small shrimp and mere flakes of what appeared to be lobster.  The sauce was good, but the pasta was the main attraction not the seafood.  I had the crab cakes.  They were just ok.  Two small crab cakes atop a mound of fingerling potatoes and green beans.  The main course was the potatoes.  

The olive oil and vinegar cruets were disgustingly sticky and I asked them to be replaced.  They were without hesitation by our server, but it's obvious they are infrequently cleaned which is concerning. 

We had high expectations but were sadly disappointed.  We won't be back.  

I got an private message and gave the Mgr my phone number many days ago. Never got a call.  So my recommendation has gone down to 2 stars."}
{"text":"I gave them a second chance. I regret it. First try here was yesterday 6/11/18 with 3 girlfriends I dragged out of the house. We were seated outside right next to the mist by the sidewalk where foot traffic was plenty. Beautiful atmosphere. Our server came and for the first few minutes she was sweet and nice. She grew impatient and short after we asked her several questions regarding drinks. The difference between the tropical martini and this other martini. So I decided to just cut it short and order something to resolve the initial interaction. She brought our drinks all was well. Food came out.. I asked for silverware. My girls are halfway through their food and I had to catch a busy boy on his way back to the kitchen and ask for napkins and silverware as she never came back with any. It was pretty quiet yesterday. Not busy at all. Still tried to make the best of it and enjoy the company of my girls. We are and our drinks were low... after our food she never came to check on us. None of us noticed the bill she placed in the middle of the table. She never asked how we want it split. So we figure when she comes back, we can ask. Again she got by us and by the time she came back our 4 credit cards were already charged. I asked, how did she decide to split the bill? She replied, \"Equally.\" I asked her why didn't she bother to ask? No response, so I did mention, in the future please check with your table and ask how they want it split. (This isn't something I should tell her) Day 2.. today. I decided to go back and redo this experience with my fiancé. As he has never been. We head in and ask if I can have the same spot yesterday. One server said yes and the assistant manager said no. I had my receipt to show her that we were just here yesterday and sat at that exact table. Her response, \"The general manager was here when you guys were here so that's why you were able to sit there.\" My thoughts... of the GM approves us sitting there, and she was only the assistant... why couldn't we sit there? We showed up same time. Today was far more dead than yesterday. Literally a total of 3 groups of a small party seated outside. I could understand if it's packed busy and they had to designate a spot. Anyway 2 days consecutive of shit service was enough for me."}
{"text":"What the heck happened to this place? The service is now terrible. The girl who sat us was rude. I stated ahead of time we wanted a booth. I recently herniated three discs so sitting in a wood chair sucks for me. So of course they tried to sit us in wooden chairs. She had a mini fit when I reminded her I asked for a booth. Trust me it sucks to be young and have had an accident I don't need a 19 year old treating me like I'm being difficult.
To top it off it took twenty minutes for a waitress to come by. She seemed shocked no one had been by to take our drink order. By this time we had our menus sat to the side and were ready to order our meal. 
There's to many good restaurants in this town to deal with bad service."}
{"text":"I had my daughters baby shower here. Let me tell you I was a pain with all my changes. The banquet manager, Nova was very helpful and patient. At the event the room was beautiful, service great and the food was really good. I did not have one complaint!"}
{"text":"I went here last week and just had to add my review. The place is gorgeous, the staff was friendly and attentive. I got the Pasta with the Vodka sauce, per reviews on here, and it was PERFECT. I also had the wedge salad which was so delicious. We had the cutest little deserts that came in an espresso cup. My only complaint was I did not like the breads that came before the meal.... and considering my entree wasn't a very big size, it would have been nice to have some really good breads before the meal. 

All in all, i think you should try it out!"}
{"text":"I've been to Brio a few times now.  The first time, I loved it, it was so wonderful and fulfilling.  I enjoyed every morsel I tasted.  The service was impeccable and the portions were well worth all that was spent on them. 

I then took a couple of friends their for Mother's Day and a thank you, they were quite impressed as well.  The food was melting in our mouths, no complaints came from us. They were very accommodating!  I love it would recommend it for a casual afternoon on the patio, or even a romantic evening with that special someone!  A definite MUST if you're in the area!  

The aroma's coming from the kitchen definitely get your mouth watering for the delectable menu!  Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't understand why this place has such a low rating. Maybe those people weren't here during happy hour? 

A group of five of us stopped in on Friday after work. It is an AWESOME happy hour! The Rosa Sangria is to die for, and all of the other drinks looked great, as well. The food is really what made this place special. Very reasonable prices (especially for Scottsdale) and a good amount of food. I recommend the Blackened Shrimp, the Artichoke Dip, and the Eggplant Fries (my favorite). The deserts are fabulous (there was a caramel/pumpkin cheesecake desert that was to die for, the lava cake was amazing, too!).

Our waitress was very attentive, considering it was a busy time. She even held her grace when we were being difficult and asked for separate checks. The crowd is obviously very Scottsdale (Botox and plastic surgery all around), but it won't deter me.

I will be returning!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went to Brio Tuscan Grille  on an invite from local friends (we are from Chicago). I received absolutely the best service from the time I walked in until I left. I had an amazing red sangria at the outside bar, where misters keep you cool,  while we were waiting for our friends. My food was perfectly cooked and tasty (gorgonzola beef medallions, veg medley and mashed potatoes). My husband enjoyed his vegetable pesto pasta. The atmosphere and decor is beautiful and seating is comfortable. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Wow! My husband and I decided to try Brio on a whim and I'm so glad we did. We had a great experience from start to finish. Our server was super on top of it and kept brining my husband a fresh soda (which is one of our favorite things a server can do!). We ordered the Quattro Bruschetta, the Gorgonzola Medallions and the Lobster Shrimp tortollini. All of it was soooo yummy! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We have had a corporate dinner two months in a row with 20 attendees.  The service has been excellent.  Nova; our contact at Brio Tuscan Grille was very easy to work with and communicated with us while preparing for our events.  We look forward to our next event already scheduled for June."}
{"text":"Avoid their take out! VERY DISAPPOINTING,  Dry pasta, dry salmon. Small portions. Will not do take out from them again. I don't mind the prices when they deliver an excellent product, but this was a rip off."}
{"text":"As a former employee for brio, i can honestly say their food is top-notch. I was there tonight for happy hour and the bar was really full but the bartender jim (james g) was outstanding and handled the high volume of customers with a sense of urgency and still made time to be personable to not only me, but almost everyone at the busy bar. 

The food is always amazing, and that goes for the happy hour food as well. Im glad i live close by now so i can visit more regularly here."}
{"text":"Service  was awful,  food cold,  drinks took a while , although  it was a weekend  ,  next time if we do go back it will be lunch week day ."}
{"text":"We came here a couple of weeks ago for reverse hh on a friday and sat at the bar to take advantage of the HH.   Mr h ordered the Brio burger and I ordered the margherita flatbread, both apps were below average apps. The burger was bland and the Hubster ordered med well and added sautéed onions. the burger was served well with charred onions.
my pizza seemed more like a thin flavorless cracker mess. I like thin pizza but this was way too thin and falling apart. We both ordered the mojitos & they were so disgusting we had to send those back.  the bartender took it personally but they were super bitter and nasty and we could not enjoy them.  I understand it's happy hour and its super busy on Fridays, affordable drinks & apps but if you want me to return...please serve some tasty food so I will be tempted to have dinner here in the future.  I doubt I will be returning."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. The 3 of us had the salad with steak on top and it was fantastic. The lettuce was fresh and the steak was a nice cut and cooked med-rare. The portion was large enough for 2 but I pigged out. All in all a great stop for lunch and not very crowded on a Tuesday afternoon."}
{"text":"The inside of this restaurant is beautiful, with its high ceilings and Tuscan villa-inspired hangings. They've also opened some of their windows so the nice breeze circulated throughout the place.

My friends and I went in for lunch. I ordered the Mezza Chicken Under the Brick, while my friends ordered an omelet and a risotto lunch special with salad. The breads for the table were delicious! My favorite was the crispy one with sesame seeds. I wish the butter was softer and more spreadable.

The Mezza Chicken, listed under 500 calories, was a good lunch-sized portion. The chicken was delicious and absorbed the mushroom flavored gravy it was topped with; but the vegetables were my favorite. They were seasoned very well and I loved the slight char on all of them. The mashed potatoes were light and provided a great contrast to the vegetables and chicken.

Our server was great and friendly. There was a mistake on our order, where we were charged an extra $5 for a salad that was included in the lunch special. When we pointed it out, she apologized and remedied it. I would definitely come here again, and I hope the location near home will be as beautiful as this one."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, server was an act in himself with my shot-drinking girlfriends at brunch. Lobster bisque was incredible. Loved everything!!"}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour and had the following dishes:

Spicy Shrimp & Eggplant (5/5)
Margherita Flatbread (3.5/5)
Pepper Formaggio Dip (Eek! 2.5/5)

My least favorite: The dip flavor was very odd (almost like the components together yielded a canned cheese flavor) and the ciabatta was over-toasted, it was more like a crostini that was way too crunchy.

The portions were huge for a Happy Hour serving and the service was really good.  I'll go again to try the ravioli or maybe just order off of the regular dinner menu."}
{"text":"We had a horrible experience yesterday. We sat ourselves out in the patio because we had a double stroller, a toddler and a baby. My husband was going to run in and let the hostess know we were out there but we saw an employee pop his head out, look at us but didn't acknowledge us. After a couple of minutes the hostess cane out to inform us that part of the patio was not being used and that we can use the other side. Okay so we moved over there no problem. As we were sitting down the waiter popped his head out handed my sister a stack of menus and told her he would be right out. We sat out there for almost 20 minutes. No one came. It was hot out and we didn't even have water offered. The restaurant was not busy at all so there was no reason for that to happen. Finally the waiter came out and didn't even apologize for the wait just wanted to know what we wanted to drink. I made a point that we had been sitting out here for a while and again didn't apologize. Instead came up with a weak excuse that he was bombarded with a bunch of stuff at the same time. So again he rudely asked what we wanted. I felt that our business was not wanted and said we were leaving. The waiter cheerfully said \"okay have a good day!\".....no apologies! We felt so horrible. I can't believe we were treated so badly. We will never be returning and will be telling everyone we know about the horrible service we received."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I decided to eat here after attending the hello kitty event. Haha. 

For appetizer, I had the Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip with Parmesan flatbread. Honestly, I was so full after that. I didn't even want my entrée anymore. Haha. But as my entrée, I ordered the Ravioli Di Bello. Which had portobello, mushrooms, grape tomatoes in it. It was very creamy but hard to eat.

The service was so slow. Our drinks took forever, I asked for napkins and it took almost 15 minutes for me to get, same goes to the to go box as well.

The ambiance was nice, the decor and set up is  like Cheesecake Factory."}
{"text":"We tried Brio tonight for the first time and loved it. The wait was pretty long, so we ended up in the Bar and grabbed a table in the bar when one opened up. The dark wood and decor are nice - we liked the feel. The bread was fresh, warm and delicious. I liked my pasta and butter (for those of you who know me, you know I'm super picky). My husband, who really only ever \"loves\" hot, spicy new mexican food, \"loved\" his dish - Chicken Milanese Pomodoro - I never hear him talk that way about Italian food. The rest of our party was enthusiastic about the food and atmosphere as well. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Service and food is phenomenal! I love the bartenders, genuinely good folks! I've been here several times and never had a bad meal, it's all good."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The food, the atmosphere and everything else! My best bro n i went here for happy hour and the food is awesome! We got two brio burgers, Carpaccio, and we got the italian lemonade and the white peach sangria! Everything was amazing and the bill was very cheap!

Jim was the best bartender ever! He had the best hospitality and was very friendly! Hes awesome! Keep it up Boss and thank you for everything!"}
{"text":"Abby was amazing! She is such a sweetheart and accommodates to anything we needed! Brio is amazing due to her hospitality #teamabby we will ask for her every time!"}
{"text":"I thought I would try Brio again during Arizona Restaurant Week to see if anything improved from my first visit.  Again,  the service was not what one would expect for this establishment.  Our drink glasses went empty and nobody noticed. I had to ask for more.  Usually, restaurants with these price points are more concerned about keeping drink glasses full. Some of the time it felt like we were on auto pilot.  I was trying to get some balsamic and olive oil for my bread.  It took awhile for the server to come back to check on out table.  The kitchen runners just drop and run.  Also, I noticed some flies in the dining room and a lady at the nearby table stood up to swat at flies.  She asked me if I noticed the flies and if I was having any trouble with flies.  There is nothing like swating flies and trying to keep them out of your dinner.  There were some very frustrating circumstances about dining here tonight."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. We walked in on a Friday night without reservations and had to wait 60-80 min for a table. BUT there was lots of shopping while we waited. Food and service were amazing. Christian was awesome. And the prices were good. Get the spicy shrimp eggplant."}
{"text":"I chose this place as my wedding lunch reception back in October. They were great and the food was delicious. My guests loved everything they ordered and the staff tended to everyone in a timely fashion. To this day, my friends and family still talk about it. I'd highly recommend them for reception lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Recenly went to brio, and loved it, all expectations were met from service to meals and drinks."}
{"text":"Service was just ok and had to ask server if there were bread, he apparantly had forgotton. Had chicken limonode which was tasty and portion  size was perfect. All the others had pasta and were small eaters and were dissappointed in the taste and the very small portion size. They all ended up ordering additional things when they saw how small their portions were. I have to say for the price, a cup or less of noodles without much on it was a rip off. I understand we are not in Little Italy but knock the pricng down if its not home made pasta and a measley portion. Have only been here once before and this experience made me remember why."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour with a  group of professionals.  Found a spot out on the porch and waited for our waiter!  Finally came.  
Rather than waste all of our time on the details.................We will not go back.  The service was terrible!  The food was good and you can't beat the happy hour prices. 
Some of group never received their order and we had to ask (waiter had forgotten to turn it in!!).  No apologies or compensation.  We spent over $100 and had to chase the waiter again to get our bill and pay. 
Not worth the great happy hour prices and treatment we got.  No thanks!"}
{"text":"I went to this location by accident. I thought I was on my way to the \"Yelp Goes Under The Tuscan Sun\" event, but I went to the wrong location. The reason why I didn't turn around and hed straight to the yelp event was because we arrived at 6:40 p.m. at the Santan Mall location and we were supposed to go to the Scottsdale Quarter location. Because it was rush hour and we had already driven from Tempe, at this point we just wanted to have a nice meal. 

At first I was bummed when I didn't see red yelp balloons and a line of eager yelpers ready to mingle, but I was starving so I decided to stay for dinner. The manager and server were very accommodating to me and my friend and I really appreciate the effort they made to make us feel welcome- despite no yelp event to attend. I really wasn't that upset! 

The food was delicious. I'm pretty sure the words \"tantalizing taste buds\" came to mind that night. I loved the ravioli appetizer and white peach sangria! My server was so sincere and attentive. I want to say his name was Fausto. My apologies if I'm wrong. The manager was very sweet, as well. Thanks so much for letting my friend and I create our own idea of what a yelp event could be with a guest list limited to 2. HAHA"}
{"text":"We went for bunch last Sunday and were horribly disappointed.  Portions were small, I had the eggs and avocado with chicken dish.  Absolutely tasteless except for the chicken which tasted like lunch meat not pieces of fresh chicken.  I expected a lot more, maybe I shouldn't have!"}
{"text":"Words can't explain the awesome experience dining at Brio's Restaurant. The service was Outstanding and the food was great. Hands down if you are looking for a nice place to dine, Brio's is it."}
{"text":"We came in on the holiday weekend. Excellent service by Summer! She promptly greeted us. We started with wine, and shared an appetizer of Spinach Artichoke Dip. It came hot and was delicious. My husband had a Grilled Chicken Breast Dinner and I got full on the appetizer. I went with the Brio chopped salad after that.  The chopped salad is always my favorite here, with a tasty dressing. The lettuce is finely chopped and is perfect before a meal when I don't have an appetizer. My husband said the chicken was flavored very well...it came with a side. He wanted pasta, the suggested side was fettuccini alfredo. He had asked if he could have the pasta with red sauce instead. Summer said \"of course\", and my husband was happy with having that option! What completed this as being a great experience, was that the manager, Corey, came by, was very friendly, and wanted to make sure we were enjoying our dinner. We were impressed he did this at the door, and noticed he also checked on other tables. Brio earned our five stars!"}
{"text":"I went there for a mid-afternoon lunch. I ordered Grilled Mahi Mahi and an iced tea. The mahi mahi came with spinach and farrow. It was okay . . .  A-OK . . . not really. $25 for lunch for a small portion of fish that somebody had not bothered to season correctly - some bites were too peppery, some were not peppery at all - I don't like pepper. The spinach was good, but there wasn't much. The bread was okay - I'm not a fan of sourdough. The crackers with everything - a step up, but not a big step up. The farrow was good and there was a good amount of it. The tea was fine - not any better than what I make at home. 

 Oh, it is healthy - they halved the portion  and doubled the price. And, after tax and tip, I spent $25 for lunch - for that much money I expect a whole lot better than I got - way better than \"I could have done far better in 15 minutes or less at home\". I won't be back."}
{"text":"We went on a Friday about 1pm and had a 10 minute wait. I had Roasted Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. The waiter asked if I wanted a half portion with a salad. I didn't know I could do that and was glad he suggested it. A full bowl of Risotto would have been too much for me. My friend had Crispy Eggplant Pomodoro, which she enjoyed. The eggplant was cut in thick slices and wasn't overly battered. We also had a bottle of Chianti Classico, San Fabiano (Tuscany, Italy). The total bill was just over $60. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"After a day of shopping in Kierland Commons we were looking for a late lunch and a cool drink.  We sat in a booth in the bar area and the service was great.  They've got a great wine list and the menu has a great varied selection - something for everyone.  For us, we just enjoyed lots of appetizers.  The spinach artichoke dip and the bruschetta sample platter were terrific and moderately priced.  It was a great place to spend an hour or two after a long day."}
{"text":"Tonight was an utter failure. A Monday night - not a busy time for them.

I've held off on updating my review for several sub-par visits. But, tonight was the tipping point.

So, here's the deal:
Newer server: 3 stars - clearly a bit overwhelmed; took several minutes to greet us; was very polite; took the orders accurately; very slow to fulfill drink orders; one glass came with a huge lipstick stain on it; didn't put the entree orders in to the kitchen until after the appetizer was consumed; was slow to check back but was very visibly trying to handle his workload with other tables.

Kitchen staff: 0 stars - the steak appetizer was the shining star of the night; lasagna was brutally overcooked; chicken milenase was just average; creme brulee was curdled! Was the Monday Night Football game a distraction? The restaurant was not busy and I counted at least 8 staff on the kitchen side of the pass.

Prior, recent, visits: the crab cakes were a majority breading not crab meat. The flat bread pizza was disappointing. I had come to expect higher quality for the price that Brio commands.

Overall, I'm going with the 2 stars as the floor manager was, at least, apologetic. And, I think the server deserves a chance to get things figured out.

My final frustration was that it appeared that the management and staff wanted to place all the blame for this very sub-par experience on the (newer) server. It was his fault that he was slow to greet and slow to get beverages served. It wasn't his fault that the crew charged with getting serving ware clean let a glass with a huge lipstick stain get through unchecked. It wasn't his fault that the pasta in the lasagna was as hard as tanned leather. It wasn't his fault that the creme brulee had curdled (a comp'd item and still a blow-it!).

Folks, it's going to be a while before I think to come back. A shame, really. Brio was on my frequent dine-out list. Now, we'll take a pass until our out-of-town friends come back and just \"have to\" come here."}
{"text":"We went on the Saturday of a holiday weekend and was surprised to get a patio table with shade. We sat across from the fountain so it had a great vibe. We initially had a concern due to a holiday special two for one for brunch and was told by the waitress that it only covered the specific brunch items not the brunch menu. The manager came over to clarify that it did indeed cover any items on the brunch menu up to $15. I ordered the Pesto Chicken and Quinoa Salad and loved it. The menu states all ingredients and the calories which is helpful in making decisions. It was so filling that I had to take some home. The staff was super friendly and the bread before the meal must be one of the best in town."}
{"text":"Jesse the General Manager was very accommodating and was helpful answering questions. He made our experience a great one.. We will be back .. thank you"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants, the prices are reasonable and the food is outstanding. It's a little bit too good when you are trying to diet. However, the lobster bisque is to die for, and one of the chocolate desserts actually melts in your mouth. Definitely a great place for a nice and quality lunch or a peaceful dinner!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Brio Tuscan Grille a few weeks ago while in Vegas during a luncheon with some friends that recently moved in the area.  They were raving about this great pasta spot near the south side of the strip so we decided to stop by here.  

I believe Brio is an Italian chain around the US, although I don't believe they have any in the Southern California area; hence, my unfamiliarity.  The decor is actually really nice.  It's more of a nice date place.  They've got a really nice faux Colisseum exhibited in the dining area.  A very nice touch to the restaurant.  

I ended up orderering the Pasta Fra Diavolo with chicken.  I thought it was ok.  It didn't really pack the kind of flavor that I was really looking for.  Usually the sauces are exuberant for this type of dish, but this one was a little on the bland side.  The chicken was also forgettable, not really adding much to the dish.

Would I come back to this place?  I'd probably give it another shot and try something else.  There was a nice salmon dish that I saw on someone else's platter that I would have liked to try."}
{"text":"This place is growing on me. I have been to the Scottsdale Quarter (Arizona) and Las Vegas locations and had the same thing and it was consistently satisfying. I got the sweet potato and chicken risotto and salad. Yum! My company also enjoyed what they ordered. Service was terrific. It definitely adds to the meal."}
{"text":"To start off, my wife came here with a girlfriend weeks ago and liked the food so much that she wanted to bring me back to try it. We were excited. We had lunch around 2pm and was greeted and seated instantly. Within minutes a busser dropped fresh bread and butter and took our drink orders. Being that it was the end of April, it's starting to get hot outside but the inside where we were seated was freezing so if you hate being cold you wouldn't have enjoyed it. After about fifteen minutes our waiter came and asked us for our order in a very hasty way to make us feel like hurry up, I have things to do. The food came out quick and it wasn't bad, not good, but not $50 worth of quality (Olive Garden is 10 times better if you get the idea) since it was so cold I tried to see if we were seated next to the vents and when I looked up, I could see the vents caked with dirt and dust. These vents are on the expediting line right above the kitchen so you'll be eating that. I looked to the ledge that separated our table booth from the kitchen and I took a picture of a thick layer of dirt at my eye level. I could only imagine the amount of dust and dirt that made its way into my food. Won't be going back anytime soon. (The napkin is what I used to clean some of the table while we were eating)

UPDATE: They reached out to me after this review stating they were concerned about my experience and wanted to speak with me. I gave my contact information and never heard a word. Hopefully they take a real hard look at their standards. This review wasn't to bash a company or restaurant but to make the guest experience better for future customers."}
{"text":"Had bad customer service when i came in. Our food came alittle late but i wasnt really worried because it was busy and i can understand that. When our food did come, it had a piece of hair. Our server took too long to come by so by that time, i lost my appetite. I paid the bill and me & my friend just left. For what it was worth, u shouldve just gone to fast food. Wouldve saved me money and time."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for lunch or dinner.  The service is fast and friendly.  The menu has all different types of choices including a wonderful gluten free menu! If you like beef carpaccio there's is the best I've  had by far.  Phoebe our server was very attentive and cheerful and the manger even stopped by to see how everything was going:).  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Recently we celebrated our Anniversary with Friends at Brio Tuscan Grille. The service was very good along with the terrific Italian cuisine; grilled salmon, mouth watering grilled pork chop (bone in); savory lobster and shrimp linguini, delicious veal scallopini and more. Our waiter refilled our water every 10-15 minutes, or as needed.

We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Good location, nice staff and well decorated restaurant. I got the salmon dinner. The salmon was very salty and over-seasoned... And this comes from a girl who loves salt! The sides it came with were pretty good, but I would suggest trying a different plate."}
{"text":"This was a fun last-minute lunch place that I and a few friends visited this weekend. I had heard about the place but had never been there. WIth this being the first day to really feel like summer (well, summer in Ohio, where I'm from) I really enjoyed sitting outside and enjoying the sunshine, the breeze and the passers by (including Carrot Top, who said hi as he ambled by). The atmosphere was fun and casual- I really liked the view of the outdoor section where diners sit separated from the sidewalks of Tivoli Village by an attractively scalloped, metal \"fence.\"  Aluminum-colored heating elements spaced throughout the outdoor area looked sculptural and artsy.  Large umbrellas protected patrons from the bright, hot sun.  Our waiter, Brian, had a great personality and made the experience even more enjoyable..

I had the risotto with chicken and the tossed salad for about $14.00. It was tasty, but I liked my friend's shrimp version better.  The crusty bread served before the meal was quite enjoyable.  A couple of us had the wedge salad, which was accompanied by a gorgonzola and garlic dressing that, in my opinion, was light and not overpowering. My friends loved that it had bacon.

I would definitely come here again and bring family or friends. Now I want to see what it looks like inside!"}
{"text":"Brio is located in the Town Square shopping center. I absolutely love it's ambiance, especially at night! 

Husband and I came in after doing a charity event. We were seated at the corner of their patio--perfect! It was like a mini impromptu date. It's like gold to be able to escape from 4 kids! Love them gremlins beyond the furthest sun but good gosh do they suck the bone marrow out of you.

My husband ordered the Pesto pasta as I opted for the sliced steak bruschetta. Both were absolutely deelish! I love how my steak melted with the bruschetta! Portioning ratio was definitely adequate for us. They are a tad pricey, in my opinion, but alot of fancier Italians places just are. The best part of Brio is that it is a place that is both classy and casual.

We ordered a couple drinks which I don't even remember their names. Lol. I will say this...bartender was NOT greedy about the alcohol content whatsoever! Husband and I were looking at each other like, how the hell are we buzzing already? Lightweights. Lol.

I'm giving this place 5 stars because while the two items we tried were pretty good but that caramel marscapone cheesecake! Wholly deelish! Please do not fail to order this when you stop in or fail to make room for it. Don't even share it! Hahaha. It's THAT deelish!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here since it opened and loved it. Since menu changed we were extremely disappointed but we wanted to give it another chance. Went there today and my husband ordered the risotto and they came back and said it wasn't ready! Really they have been open since 11:00 and we know chefs get there early so what's the deal? Then server asked if there was something else he would like and he said the salmon and she said sorry we are out of salmon!!!! So we got up
and left and went to Cheesecake Factory. Won't be going back to Brio's until they make necessary changes to get their loyal customers to come back.


Since our last review management reached out to us and we have to say this last meal was a pleasant experience food was very good! We will be back for sure. And John our server is always very pleasant!"}
{"text":"There are so many good places to eat in Town Square.  My friend was surprised that I had never eaten there when she invited me a few weeks ago.  (I had attended a private event there last year.  There was a buffet of simple items, such as fruit, cheese, etc.)

Anyway, I was completely unaware her intent was to avail ourselves to the happy hour specials.  I had sat in the main dining room and had already ordered a glass of Pinot Grigio.  The waiter checked with the manager and she was kind enough to offer us the specials.  

To be honest, the HH specials didn't do it for me.  I ordered the pasta brio.  First, I knew when I got it that I would get to take home about half and enjoy for lunch the next day.  It was delicious!  Grilled chicken, mushrooms, rigatoni...I'm not sure what be sauce was, but it was tasty!

Also, let me give props to my super waiter.  He got me my wine and a glass of water before my friend arrived.  He also brought bread with oil, balsamic, and Parmesan cheese.  

My friend enjoyed her hh of shrimp and an inexpensive wine.  

Great balance to our evening!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful night we had at the Yelp event!  Fantastic food, bruschettas, homemade cocktails and delicious pastas and desserts.  We enjoyed ourselves to no end chatting with our friends and taking in the ambiance of such a unique place."}
{"text":"First time there, and I'm giving it 3 stars because of the server(s) only....company party and reservations made in advance, but when I got there, the hostess had no idea what I was talking about for the reservation....uh oh....so, I went to the bar to wait for others to arrive, and a different hostess started seating my party & they called me to find out where I was!!  I was pretty clear to the hostess originally of the name I was looking for, and I'd be at the bar if they arrived.  I wasn't rude, I understood there had to have been some miscommunication somewhere, and would she please alert me if someone else from our party showed up so I could greet them.  From the bar, you can't easily see the hostess station...

Sigh...anyways, while at the bar, I was greeted warmly and the service was superb...the table for 18 was placed in the middle of the main dining area, which was fine, but we'd been assured there would be a private space for our group.  Guess we got outbid by a larger group?  Anyways, not trying to be picky, but when I know this will be at least a $500 tab, I expect to be treated accordingly!!  

The food server(s) tho made up for the initial impression...and that's the best part of this review!  The food wasn't what I felt to be any better than Olive Garden, and I'd actually have preferred the food there?  Go figure!  We ordered appetizers, not impressed with the lobster bisque, the roasted garlic spinach artichoke dip, or the breads....so, bring on the salad....I had a house salad, which sounded pretty amazing as described by the food server, but was a disappointment when I got it, and I know the feeling was mutual with the other salad that was ordered too.  

Main course, we had some lasagna orders, some veal marsala orders, some carbonara orders, and some other pasta dishes that I couldn't discern....no one from our group was impressed, and we're not foodies or culinary school graduates or anything, so that's saying a LOT about the quality of the food....it was filling!!  

Personally, I don't think I'll be going back, but I wouldn't say no to a date taking me there....I'll just know not to expect to be WOW'ed by the food, and just enjoy the atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"Service and food was really good! The martini selection has lots of unique options. I had Mediterranean Shrimp and a peach sangria. Both were great. It's a big place and stays busy. Give it a try! Also an H&M is next door."}
{"text":"This is my favorite happy hour in all of Vegas! $5 drink specials and several food items for $2.95!! And it tastes good! I've been here more times than I can count and keep coming back. The outdoor seating area is limited so you may have to wait for a seat.. the seating is better at the location in town square."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's my favorite Happy Hour in Vegas! $5 drink specials and several food options for $2.95! And it tastes good! The outdoor seating here is amazing! I've never not been able to find a seat, even with a large group."}
{"text":"It was okay. The hostess was telling customers that there would be a 20 minute wait to sit on the patio. When somebody questioned the wait -- since half of the tables were empty -- she replied that they only had one server for the patio. Huh? Five minutes later the manager came over, and it was obvious that he was asking why people were waiting? Next thing you know, everyone had seats on the patio. Let me guess...they assigned another waiter to the patio? Anyway, the bruschetta was good, the steak in the steak salad was a little wanting, and the waiter needs a little more training: I asked for Chenin Blanc. He said that he didn't know if they had that brand. I do have to say that it was very nice on the patio. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Not normally a 25% tipper but Brio got mine on 4/20/12! Great food, great service, and great experience as well. It was Friday night and the place was SLAMMED, 45 minute wait for a table. Wife and I decided to sit at the bar and try the house cocktails while we waited. Ended up staying at the bar where we enjoyed the company of the staff, full food service, and GREAT food! We shared the risotto and it was magnificent! Reminded me of the risotto I'd enjoyed in Northern Italy. Definitely recommend dining at Brio Tuscan Grille if you're on the Strip in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I think the service and the food was equally great. I think our waitress was in training but she did really good. My friend just said we were gonna share and when our food came out, we had our own plates.i think that was really nice and she was paying attention. The food came out at a reasonable time.we didn't wait long."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. Great service, great food and amazing outdoor atmosphere. This is a can't miss place to eat!!"}
{"text":"Really good, attentive service. We like to go to the bar for the happy hour. Split their burger, shrimp & eggplant in black pepper cream sauce, calamari, and beef carpaccio. Very good food. And each of those is $3.95. The bar splits inside & out which will be nice on a warmer night. They do have a drape that cuts some of the cold and heaters too. It's really good food paired with great service."}
{"text":"Looked like they were giving food and drinks away here. 
from 5pm til about 9ish ----almost seat was taken.
tastefully decorated,
happy hour is happening
Crab cakes were delicious, 
2 and they were small, I think their portions can be a bit larger,
especially for what they charged.
outside seating as well."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner with some friends service was nice. Menu was ok they didn't have much food without alcohol or pork. I got the spicy shrimp which was good. Everyone else at my table got salads and no one complained the lava cake was really good though !"}
{"text":"YUMMY! everything I have tried here has been delicious. This place is always extremely busy at dinner time. Try it for lunch if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Service was really slow. It was terrible that we got our waitress got switched and we never got what we ordered until a new waitress came. The food was delish but it seemed like everyone was in a bad mood. I get sometimes you have a bad day but cmon. The food was amazing but wish service would have been better"}
{"text":"Lovely decorated, roomy and classy. Food prices were pretty legit for an upscale restaurant. Food selection was ample, ranging from steak, to breakfast, to lotsssss of different pastas. 

Our waiter was kind of rushed and cold, but he warned up somewhat towards the very end...he looked like he hadn't slept in weeks and his attitude reflected it. 

Try the fried calamari with aioli sauce!"}
{"text":"Great food! Our server was Jasmine, she gave us good suggestions. We had awesome pasta dishes. Wonderful evening"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the only time to go! Obviously my previous statement means this following review applies only to the happy hour menu and service. The food on the menu is $2.95 per item; this is as good as cheap gets! The food is great and the Brio Burger is definitely one of the best. The bruschetta is a another one of my favorites... oh, and the eggplant... and the beef carpaccio... and the--just kidding, they're all pretty freaking good! Unfortunately, they don't really have drinks on the happy hour menu. I usually still get a mojito and it's filled to the brim with ice, leaving very little room for actual alcohol in addition to the fact that they add too much club soda and not enough rum.

The desserts are not on the happy hour menu, but they are definitely delicious. The available desserts seem to vary according to a random and unknown schedule because there's always an old item from the past visit missing and always something new to try.

The service is great and the food comes out quite quickly."}

{"text":"Wow.  Really blown away by my experience here tonight (Saturday evening, dinner).

The interior is very nice, but not stuffy or pompous. Casual wear is not out of place.

Ordered a couple drinks off the bar menu, a Raspberry Mojito and an Italian Mule. So good, I would return just for drinks.

REALLY enjoyed the food. The lobster bisque was hearty and flavorful,  and I considered cancelling my entree and just getting another 2-3 bowls, it was that yummy.

But I am glad I didn't do that, because the entrees were delicious.  Campanelle Carbonara was a very flavorful pasta dish, with just the right balance of ingredients.  The Mahi Mahi special was perfect. Grilled without being over seasoned,  allowing the flesh to be the center of attention.

We enjoyed a dessert trio that was a fantastic finish to the meal. A mascarpone cheesecake that had hints of cinnamon, a creme brulee that was the perfect texture, with plenty of vanilla, and an AMAZING seasonal strawberry shortcake that blended flavors and textures exquisitely. 

It was one of those meals where every scrap was consumed,  and every belly is satisfied.

If I HAD to come up with a negative... like, for a job interview or something ('what is the greatest weakness?') ...the portions were too perfect.  Any more would have been too much, any less would've been overpriced tapas.

Where Brio really stood out tonight, was the service and personnel. Quite simply the best service I recall having in a long time. 

The hostesses were smiling and welcoming, and made sure to give us a nice goodbye on the way out. We were visited three times by the manager - he brought out our soups/salads, checked on us during the meal, and checked again at the end of the meal.  Really invested to ensure we had a good experience. I should have gotten his name. He was great.

Our server... Nick... was simply awesome. Friendly, but not goofy or cheesy. Paid really good attention to glasses and plates,  and ensured we we never sitting there wanting. Suggested options and offered upgraded, without an ounce of pushiness.

I simply cannot wait to get back to Brio"}
{"text":"I gotta admit, I've spent several happy hours out on the patio at Brio. Our usual server is a cute young thing and he always remembers our tastes. While I'd like some drink specials for happy hour, you can't complain about a $2.95 appetizer list... and everything tastes pretty good. By everything, I mean we ordered one of everything and went through 4 bottles of wine our first time there. It's also a terrific people watching spot; leave it to Scottsdale to have constant traffic at the valet out front when there's a half-empty parking garage 10 feet away.

Recommendations: the flavor of the shrimp with eggplant was great (I wouldn't call it spicy, though), and the roasted red pepper bruschetta was really tasty as well (despite the fact that I hate peppers)."}
{"text":"This review is based solely on their Happy Hour, which is one of my favorites in town! I usually go here whenever I just want to grab some refreshing sangrias and a quick bite with a friend. 

Their HH is Monday-Friday 3:30-6:30pm and their reverse HH is 9pm-close. Keep in mind that it can get busy and seating at the bar, tables and booths are first come, first served. However, there have been a few times where it gets too packed in the bar area that the server will accommodate my party and I and we get to sit in the main restaurant area even though we are doing happy hour, which I really appreciate! 

Their cocktails range from $4-6 and each food item on the HH menu range from $5-6 which are GREAT deals! The drinks are delicious and can be pretty strong (especially their sangrias lol) so they don't cheap you out on getting your alcohol on! 

White peach sangria, the Moscow Mule, and the Black Raspberry Cosmo are my favorites and a must try! 

For food: Very shareable! We usually like to just order a few items and will be stuffed by the end of the meal. Our favorites include the Black Pepper Shrimp, Brio Burger (omg so good!) and the Margherita Flatbread. All super yummy, filling, and satisfying.

Their service is always really great and they even have a rewards card that you might want to get to stack up some points. 

With that said, if you're looking for a good place to get your Happy Hour on, definitely go to Brio!"}
{"text":"I do like the wedge salad; however, the 'famous' lobster bisque never has ANY lobster in it....they do put a few shrimp pieces on top....but no lobster and I even asked for it specifically. I tried this bisquie number of times; I think they should just call it creamy thick soup that uses the seafood soup base."}
{"text":"Brio is a consistently good restaurant. They finally shortened their menu which I was very glad to see. I love their food, service and how well kept everything is!"}
{"text":"Great Place for Happy Hour

Brio at San Tan Village has a happy hour that can't be beat.  My wife and I will stop by as we are out running errands.  The bar staff is cordial and efficient in a busy atmosphere.  

There is a good selection of alcoholic beverages discounted along with quite a few menu items."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS RESTAURANT!!!  I happily recommend it here, because I have recommended it to many friends, all of whom have loved it as much as I do.  The servers are professional without being stuffy - -always pleasant and helpful, and you never feel they are pressuring you to run up the bill.  The food is divine.  The portions are large, so I often just get two appetizers.  They have both indoor and sheltered outdoor seating, and can accommodate large groups.  If you get a loyalty card (no cost), you can receive email offers for discounts and special meals.  Both the Las Vegas and Miami locations are equally good, and both are located near excellent shopping, making them great choices for lunch when I am running errands on a weekend.  Both locations also have valet parking."}
{"text":"Beautiful grille-great atmosphere for lunch or dinner. We were out playing 'tourist' on the strip, and found Brio on Yelp. Stopped in for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with our 'find' tucked in Town Square just off the Las Vegas Blvd. 
All of the staff including Asst. Manager Ashley welcomed us, making our lunch memorable. Spinach dip with homemade flat bread is excellent!
Generous portions, full bar, comfortable dining area. They offer outside patio seating, too."}
{"text":"One of my FAVORITE places to eat in all of Las Vegas! Town Square is already an upbeat, amazing place to hang out with friends, shop, play but mostly to EAT at. 

What makes Brio a must eatery:
1) Beautiful atmosphere - very old European, classic, romantic.
2) Service was awesome. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly
3) All the food was amazing!

Brio is a must for anyone who has not tried it. You will not be dissapointed!"}
{"text":"There's mixed reviews for this place and in trying not to be biased by that, I'm writing this review after having dined there twice.  Had the Shrimp Mediterranean for dinner and eggs benedict for lunch and both were really good.  
 
Perhaps my expectations were really low during both occasions (alas, I guess was biased by the reviews), but the grilled shrimp was pretty good and the orzo/farro pilaf was done just right with great flavor.  I normally don't eat rice/pasta, but I have to say this was worth the carb points!

The eggs benedict was over toasted brioche which was a nice change from the classic english muffin.  Although I think I still prefer the crunch of the english muffin over the brioche which was slightly on the soft side (not soggy, just a softer texture than what one is used to with eggs benedict).  But, this passed the main test of quality with flying colors as the poached egg was done perfectly.  After have an extremely poor experience at nearby Cheesecake factory, the bleeding yolks here were very satisfying.

Both experiences were topped off by excellent service.  You're greeted kindly and they try to make some polite conversation as they walk you to your seat.  The waiter/waitress were really kind and polite.  Really not much more to ask for from an upper end chain restaurant.

As for the conflicting reviews out there, I have to admit I went during off-peak hours and didn't go expecting to have \"authentic italian cuisine.\""}
{"text":"WORSE FOOD I ATE IN MY LIFE! They serve garbage salad with old microwaved oversalted fish and half of it skinny sticks of deep fried potatoes. 
Calamari was old. Deep fry staff fell off They microwave them fir sure half of it was deep fried pickles ??!!! Wtf? Soup from lobster was just over salted sauce
Tea and bread was ok"}
{"text":"Over the weekend my lady friends and I tried Brio to celebrate my best friend's birthday. The atmosphere was fantastic, well lit, great decor.  

We started our night off with a couple glass of wine at the bar. I thought the wine list was minimal but the merlot I got was decent. There were lots of great food choices on the menu. I started my meal with the lobster bisque which was excellent.  For my entree I have mushroom stuffed raviolis, very delicious. For desert my girl friend and I tried the crème brulee trio (Vanilla, Carmel & Hot Chocolate). I must say that even though it was nice to try the different flavors I am still a big fan of the plain vanilla crème brulee. 

The overall experience was terrific and plan on returning."}
{"text":"My dinner here was quite a pleasant surprise. I was at Tivoli Park for an event and suggested Brio for dinner since we were there. I dined at a Brio at a different location, but it had been a few years. We had to wait for a few minutes, but that's expected on a Saturday night. Once we were seated, our server took our drink order and then our food order. The wait wasn't very long and the food was delicious. I had the Sweet Potato & Chicken Risotto. My partner had the lasagne. My meal was absolutely scrumptious. I was hesitant about ordering it, but my server guaranteed me that I would enjoy it. He was right. I tasted the lasagna and it was cheesy and tasty. There was nothing special about the service. It was average. The restaurant was a little louder than I. Ike, but once my meal arrived, I easily forgot about that. I'll definitely go back more often."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT. The managers and staff are beyond rude. The establishment is disgusting and not up to health codes. The food used to be delicious now I wouldn't feed their meals to my dogs. Brio should be closed down immediately Scottsdale deserves better!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that I liked Brio!  I am not usually a fan of chains, even small ones.  I fully expected to be disappointed but from start to finish I found this place delicious.  We started with the crab and shrimp dip. The parmesan crisps were excellent company for the tasty dip with actual chunks of crab and shrimp.

I followed with artichoke crusted beef medallions which were great! We also had the risotto which was a bit disappointing.

For desert, they were out of several items but we tried the bread pudding.  This is the one fail for Brio in that it tasted like ice cream on store bought pound or marble cake.  Still overall it was a great time. The drink selections were excellent too.

A little on the pricey side but not out of the spectrum of value."}
{"text":"Far better of late! We go once every couple of weeks now for the consistency. It's predictable in a good way and close to home and office. *Best* service is with John at the bar. Lobster bisque, mushroom soup, carpacccio, and the lasagna are faves.

But... Some minuses still include odd servings if you get food to go or ask for your wedge salad chopped for you; your still only getting half the dish?! Table service is consistent; consistently slow. 

I keep hoping for more.

Previous review:

Ordering to-go: Half the food you order in-house but the same price and they expect to be tipped. Tasty, sure. Predictable in a good way. But having ordered both the soup and salad in-person, spending the same money on tiny to-go containers is unfair. Management contacted, let's see what happens."}
{"text":"Good food. Service was slow but the place was packed. Excellent dessert.  Loved the place settings and decor. Had to park in the garage, but it's not a long walk."}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant in Gilbert, Arizona. For my 21st birthday, my family, my boyfriend and I went here to meet my family that lives in Henderson for my birthday dinner. All I remember is good wine and fabulous service, just like the Gilbert location. The decor is BEAUTIFUL. Probably a nice place to take someone on a date (hint, hint). 

Side note: this restaurant is located with a plethora of shopping around. SO, if you want to just pop in after doing some cardio while shopping and grab a glass of wine, I feel like it would be enjoyable."}
{"text":"My mom and I love coming here to have a few glasses of wine after shopping. We order their bruschetta, but BE CAREFUL if you have allergies. One of the bruschetta has some shellfish or shrimp on it but the menu did not explicitly say it would be part of the bruschetta platter when we ordered it the first time. My mom is allergic. Scary. Now we know better, I guess. 
Anyways, overall, we love the ambiance here and we love the vino. Ok... We love the vino."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is absolutely delicious and the service is always spectacular. I recommend ordering their casear salad- their homemade dressing is impeccable. Also their flatbread and pasta alla vodka are both favorite dishes of mine
Love this place, always stop by when i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, very courteous and friendly waitress and the food is mouth watering goodness from appetizers down to its desserts! Luckily we got there for early dinner coz this place gets packed. To the staff, kudos ya'll!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner tonight. Good atmosphere. Decent service and the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Edited review.  Long story short, I had an overall disappointing experience with Brio and thought that it may have just been an off night. The parent company contacted me in regard to my previous review and asked for a second chance. My wife and I took them up on their offer and enjoyed a wonderful meal, professional and friendly service, and an overall excellent experience.  If you have problem with your meal or service, bring it up with the manager (as I should have at the time) and I'm sure they will correct it. I'll definitely visit Brio again and now recommend it."}
{"text":"Kids portions are HUGE! Food is always served hot and fresh. 

I have had great servers but seems service support is sometimes a step behind, which causes the server to get unnecessarily weeded and the table to not get essentials: waiting almost 5 minutes after being seated to get a highchair (which we requested when checking in with the host stand), the bread basket not being dropped off until requested and after our entree hit the table) or water refills...

I still give it 5 stars for my servers always being pleasant, helpful and friendly and because the food has always been on point."}
{"text":"You are in Towne Square so it is going to be more expensive. The food was very good quality and well prepared.  The one disappointment was the jumbo shrimp appetizer.  There was absolutely nothing jumbo about the skinny little shrimp they brought out.  To add insult to injury, it was a really sad.  We mentioned it to the server and he gave us a sheepish look and ended up bringing out a couple more skinny shrimp. 

The remainder of the dishes were on point and properly sized.  I would stop I here again if looking for a good quality meal in Towne Square"}
{"text":"I'm not from Vegas, so I'm not sure if this is a restaurant chain, but it surely has a chain atmosphere to it. Think of it as a nicer Macaroni Grill with better food. I ordered the seafood risotto and very much enjoyed it, but the shrimp were not fully cooked and still a little blue. We had to take it home to recook it on the stove. The risotto itself was enjoyable though. Service wasn't excellent, but not terrible. The server notified us that one of the entree we ordered was not available about 15 minutes after all of us ordered, which she should have known ahead of time or notified us earlier, but no harm done."}
{"text":"I love being that Brio has an patio and a huge fire pit for their customer. They have great ambiance and great. The staff are welcoming and very knowledgeable with their menu. Try the salmon salad and bruschetta platter"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place out for awhile. Finally went to the town square location. Location wise it was perfect. I love town square. Patio was great. But too hot to sit out. Inside looked like a basic olive garden. Food was alright. Nothing out of this world. Service was good."}
{"text":"I've never dealt with more snobs in my life that I have at this restaurant. My wife and I went here for a couple drinks and appetizers before attending a movie in the same complex.  Our first server, didn't catch his name but he was old enough to be my grandfather, essentially scoffed at us once we told him we didn't want to have dinner but only a couple appetizers and drinks.  After putting in our drink order of some peach iced tea special they had (nothing on the drink menu sounded tasty), he disappeared and sent a younger waiter to help us.  Neither offered an explanation of why the change, but I assume its because Grandpa expected to receive a crappy tip since we weren't there for dinner.  We ordered the Margherita flatbread and ravioli appetizer.  The flatbread was a good concept, but when I think \"flatbread.\" I think flat bread.  This tasted more like a New York style thin crust pizza.  The raviolis were good but tasted like they were frozen and thrown into an oven for a few minutes.

One of my biggest pet peeves while dining out is having an empty glass.  Between the iced tea and a water that I ordered afterwards, both went empty before a refill was offered.  Additionally, after we finished everything, we sat there, with all plates and glasses stacked at the end of the table signifying that we were done, for about 10 minutes before our server finally appeared for the first time since taking our order (no one came to check to see if everything was okay after food was brought out.)

In conclusion, I rated this restaurant a \"1\" due to a commercialized food taste as well as receiving a level of service that was amazingly horrible.  This place is the very reason people call the area \"Snobbsdale\" and never in a million years would I recommend this place to my worst enemy."}
{"text":"While our server was nice, it's overpriced and the food tastes like it came out of a box or the freezer. Wont being going back."}
{"text":"Brio's Birthday Deal:
My son chose to spend his 15th birthday dinner here on Monday night.  We (son, his father, and I) arrived at 6:00pm and the patio area was packed when we walked by, but we were promptly seated inside at a spacious booth.  I told the hostess that we were celebrating the teenager's birthday and her immediate reaction was, \"Oh, you didn't tell us at the front--let me get his birthday card!\"  What?  So, she came right back with a birthday card that was obviously pre-handwritten for such occasions, but it did include a coupon for a free appetizer on our next visit--nice touch.  The kind lady also informed us that the birthday boy was also going to get a free dessert of his choosing with a lit candle, but that there would be no singing--yay!  My son picked the perfect place for his birthday!  We've been to Brio several times and this is one of the reasons--they give great customer service.  Our waitress was attentive, we always had plenty of bread and drink refills, and were satisfied with our dishes:  Chicken Under the Brick, Sweet Potato and Chicken Risotto, and Grilled Shrimp & Orzo.  The kid chose the Chocolate Lava cake and free dessert is always delicious!  If you want to get the most for your money on your birthday, check out Brio:  great food, fantastic service, and freebies!"}
{"text":"From happy hour to regular dining I'm never disappointed with the service or food. The beef carpaccio and brio burger are my faves along with the Kaiken Malbec. Wish I could eat here every night of the week."}
{"text":"This review is based off of the last two visits. The food is always delicious here. I really feel as those the management is lacking in the sanitary areas and managing employees. When we were seated our table and seats were FULL of crumbs. The bathroom was dirty and out of toilet paper and there was a roll on the floor. The dividing walls between the tables were very dusty. It's just very disappointing because they are supposed to be an upscale restaurant and their food is amazing but at this point is over priced. When we went on Mother's Day yesterday our bread was frozen in the center! So now I know their bread isn't even freshly baked."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself was beautiful.  The ceilings are very high and the decor is real nice.  The food is way too expensive for what you get. The waiter that we had was ok.  I ordered the lobster bisque only to get our food and no lobster bisque ever came.  The bread to start was ok.  My husband found a piece of wax paper in his piece.  The plate with my food was good looking to my palate but it tasted so bland.  I had the prosciutto and fontina cheese stuffed chicken breast with mashed potatoes.  The  prosciutto was not good and it actually felt like I was eating onions. I don't like onions.  I never did see the cheese or taste it.  The chicken has a bit of fat on it.  The mashed potatoes got cold very quickly as the air conditioning in the restaurant blew in our faces. My husband ordered a pasta dish with lots of shell fish.  He didn't like his either.  

We should of went to Nora's as I was originally thinking of first but decided on Brio because I wanted to go to Town Square."}
{"text":"Great happy hour! The service was attentive. The parking was convenient. The food was very good. The rest room was clean! 

It was my first time there and we were happy! Thanks."}
{"text":"Lunch at Brios - Our 3 plates were a TRIFECTA of PERFECTION. My Steak Salad was great! Service was A+ too. Highly Recommend Brios. Enjoy =)"}
{"text":"Brio is one of my favorite spots to go for happy hour because their drinks and appetizers are always so amazing. I love that this Brio is located in beautiful Tivoli Village (which so happens to be the center that I work at). Their outdoor seating is beautiful and overlooks the fountain. Our server Justin was very helpful and fun to talk to, and he made our experience that much more enjoyable. I always get the flatbreads and bruschettas whenever I eat at Brio which are all very delicious. Their drinks are great as well, my personal favorite from their happy hour menu is the Santa Rosa. It's basically a rosé sangria."}
{"text":"Convient to the Red Rock, Summerlin, Lakes area of Las Vegas. Restaurant atmosphere was inviting and pleasant. The service was top notch, and the food excellent. The meals are a great value. They should implement a children's menu, the food was great but way too much and wasteful for little ones."}
{"text":"Came here last night for the very first time having received two gift cards. Was very happy to receive 1000-points for reserving a table from open table. 
Our server greeted us immediately and was served with a basket of bread. I started off w a glass of prosecco and put in two appetizers for the table: the calamari and the spicy shrimp & eggplant. The calamari was good, nothing special. It came with two dipping sauces: garlic aioli and a marinara sauce. But the spicy shrimp & eggplant was really good!! The eggplant was lightly breaded to a perfect crisp topped off with shrimp. So far, my favorite!! And another perk!! If you check in on Yelp, you get a free appetizer! So was very happy about this. 

As my entree, I got the shrimp Mediterranean which is 5 jumbo grilled shrimp on top of orzo, farro, broccoli, asparagus, tomatoes, spinach, and feta. It's the light menu so it only has 485 calories! Might as well eat light since the appetizers and the Cesar salad I got. My husband got the shrimp and lobster fettuccine. It looked great but when I saw my husband's face I knew something wasn't right. He thought it tasted too fishy and he actually sent it back. (He NEVER sends anything back so I was really taken back). He ended up trading it for the pasta Brio instead which has grilled chicken, seared mushrooms, w roasted red pepper sauce. He said it was better but nothing spectacular... he felt like it needed more sauce. 

My shrimp Mediterranean was good but it didn't blow me away but if you're picking from the light menu, what do you expect? Besides I was full from the bread, appetizers and salad.. my girlfriend got their ravioli special which I wished I had gotten instead. It's buy one, take one home! Very cool! You can have another full meal the very next day. I ended up eating one shrimp and lobster ravioli and it was excellent!! 

Overall, the food is good. Definitely recommend the spicy shrimp & eggplant appetizer. And the service was excellent! Took off one star simply due to the fact that the food is good but not spectacular. Will come back and try their happy hour."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Atmosphere was nice with ambient lighting and great presentation. Overall fine dining experience however I did not really care for the menu. Don't get me wrong, the food was great, but nothing really popped up to me."}
{"text":"As far as chains go this is a not so bad one. It's in a great location and is always busy. On weekend nights a reservation is needed (you have to call to make one). The staff is always friendly and the service pretty quick. If you sign up for their emails you get the occasional good coupon. The menu is pretty large and has much more than just your typical Italian place pasta on it. There is outdoor seating and even a small outdoor bar."}
{"text":"My good friend was in town for her birthday and she wanted to meet at Town Square for lunch and shopping. She chose Brio. I am not a huge fan but agreed to meet since it was her birthday. My other friend and I arrived first and scored a nice table outside as the weather was perfect. Our two friends arrived shortly after us and we all got comfortable. I just wanted to have a light lunch so I chose the Strawberry Chicken salad. My friend chose the Chicken Limone. My salad was better than expected with good flavor from the spicy pecans and the goat cheese. We also enjoyed really good service. Our server was always there filling up our water and tea. She was kind enough to take a couple of pictures for us too which I know can be a pain when one has several other tables to take care of. I have been to both Brio's here in town and I would have to say that I like the one at Town Square over the one at Tivoli Village. The atmosphere and the outdoor patio dining at Town Square is much nicer then having to inhale exhaust from the cars that are driving through Tivoli Village. I do like Brio's happy hour too during the summer as they offer some great drink specials at decent prices. This was an afternoon of good times with good friends to celebrate Buon Compleanno!"}
{"text":"They have a burger here during happy hour that's worth 12 bucks but discounted for 4 dollars between 3 to 6pm. I can't get over how good this burger is for 4 bucks. The best value in vegas."}
{"text":"Let's get one thing straight - I love Brio at Town Square, so after going to the Kidville CYME today (8/22/11,) I headed over here at 11:30 AM. The place was pretty dead, save for a handful of tables. Literally, you could count the tables that were full on one hand. My three siblings and I were sat at a booth right next to the kitchen (annoying) and given menus. 

Our waiter would periodically pop in to say that he would be with us in a minute and after a little over 10 minutes, we finally got to order our waters. 5-7 minutes later, he ask if we still needed time with the menu or if we were ready to order. We were ready. After the wait, my sister and I were talking about just getting up and leaving - it's aggravating to be discriminated against because we're young. Don't put us in the back by the kitchen because we have two kids with us and don't ignore us because you think you won't get a good tip. Bad service, like what was exhibited, equals a bad tip.

Anyway, I ordered the lunch portion of the sweet potato & chicken risotto with the bistecca salad ($12.95.) My sister got the fettuccine rustica ($9.95) and then our younger siblings got the kid's ravioli ($4.95) and the kid's fettuccine alfredo ($4.50.) 

My food was okay but extremely salty/ msg-ish. It had that overwhelming umami flavor that comes with excessive msg so that made me leery. I actually got really full quite quickly and couldn't finish it all. Also, the risotto was kind of unappetizing with the cubes of not soft sweet potato and green beans. It was edible, but I wouldn't order it again. My sister complained that her pasta was also extra salty and she left most of the \"goodies\" in her bowl. The kids liked their pasta - it actually came in the same size bowls as our meals with the same sized portions. I was actually worried that the waiter didn't write that they were kids' meals.  

We got one water refill about 5 minutes before we got the check. We would have ordered dessert but my sister said she was really sick of constantly waiting for our waiter so I paid $40 and we bounced. Go to Brio at Town Square at Happy Hour if you want a great deal and great service. Come to Brio at Tivoli Village if you want to be ignored and leave unsatisfied with your meal."}
{"text":"First time at Brio today! Decided to sit outside because the weather was amazeballs. The wait wasn't too bad (20-ish minutes) and we got to sit outside in the nice weather. However, there were numerous hostesses that all seemed not very friendly. They were just okay. Our waiter was chill and friendly enough. Key word -- \"enough\". Meh.

My lunch date ordered something on the brunch menu and waited quite a while before the waiter came and told us that brunch ended at 2 (it was 3pm). However, the menu stated that brunch ends at 3:30pm, which was bewildering to say the least. Last time something like this happened to me where my original dish couldn't be made and I waited a while, the restaurant gave me my meal for free. Brio offered nothing as compensation and the apology sounded far from sincere.

So why 4 stars if the service was not very good? The fooooood! The sourdough bread was warm and yummy and the cracker positively bursted with flavor. My risotto was tasty and cheesy without being too heavy (the chicken in it was a little dry though). The salad I chose with my risotto was the wedge salad, which was huge and crispy and well-plated and just awesome. 

My date ended up ordering the salmon with angel hair pasta and he was a little disappointed when the plate arrived at the table. \"Only this much food for 15 bucks?!\" Well he took a bite of the salmon and was surprised to find it juicy and tender. The taste definitely made it worth the price.

The food far exceeded my expectations but the service left me hungry for more. I will probably eat here again if I'm at Town Square and the weather is nice. Hopefully the employees will be friendlier and enjoy their jobs more next time I visit."}
{"text":"Brio, where have you been all my life?! I was down at Town Square on Saturday, 4/16/11 because my sister had to meet with one of the directors for a project she was working on and I didn't feel like sitting through the meeting. I wasn't going to get home till way past midnight so I needed to grab some food. I wanted to check out Brio, but assumed it would be super expensive and I felt silly spending $40 to eat by myself. I headed on over to CPK but it was overpriced and I wasn't in love with anything I saw on the menu. Despite my reservations, I checked out Brio and Wow! They're actually cheaper than CPK!

I went inside and was told it would be 10-20 minutes for a table for one. I was mid-heel turn when the hostess told me I could eat at the bar. The weather was gorgeous and the bartender was very friendly. I ordered the chopped salad and lobster bisque ($1 up charge) deal. The bread basket is amazing with the best crispy flat breads and sourdough I've ever had. My total, with tax and tip came out to $11, which isn't bad whatsoever. When my sister showed up, the waitress told me the Dr. Pepper was on her that I ordered for my sister, which was nice of her. Forget the Strip, my sister and I agreed that this would be our go to restaurant from now on. 

Because I enjoyed my first visit so much, two days later, 4/18/11, after hitting up the 51's game, Beau S. and I headed over here for some after the game drinks. We walked right in to a fairly empty restaurant. We went to the bar and were told it was happy hour. I got beef carpaccio and he got the steak bruschetta and they were each $2.95. It was a great deal and I loved all the capers that came with my carpaccio. I got a soda water and Beau got some sort of beer. We also split a caffe panna cotta that was out of this world. The total, with tip was $15. Really great deal. 

Obviously, I'll be back for a third time!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a few friends and we honestly were not impressed. The food was not that great. We ordered off of the lunch menu. I ordered a prosciutto sandwich and a lobster bisque soup. The sandwich did not have any prosciutto on it and was mostly slimy cheese and the soup was extremely salty and I think there was a hair in it. A friend of mine is vegan and ordered a plain salad with just vegetables in it and they charged her $20 for it. She brought it up to the waitress and she said it was because it was a modified salmon salad... But she didn't have salmon in it which is the most expensive part. We also waited 40 minutes for our food and it wasn't even right. It came with items she didn't ask for and it took an additional ten minutes for the waitress to bring her side of salad dressing. It's a shame that the food isn't great because the place is really nice and has patio seating."}
{"text":"After work decided to go to Brio happy hour. It's from 9pm to 11pm. Probably some of the best deals I've seen in a while. Had a red sangria which was pretty strong for $4 dollars and they had a variety of foods ranging from $4 to $6 dollars. The Brio Burger is good and the potato chips are great. Also had the flatbread pizza which is good also. If your looking for a good happy hour with good food and drinks... This place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Food:8/10
Service:10/10
Price:8/10
Atmosphere: 8/10

We've seen Brio around towns square for the past few years now and decided to give it a try for Valentines Day. We were not disappointed! 

The food was really good! I ordered the New York Strip ( it was cooked to perfection) and my girlfriend ordered the Signature dish Chicken Limone. Everything was cooked great and tasted amazing except the roasted veggies, they were just blah.
Our waiter, Rami, was awesome!! He has a great personality and genuine customer service. He made our entire experience amazing and is the main reason we will start to come to Brio more often!
The price isn't too bad considering the amount of food you get. Our meals along with an appetizer and 2 drinks a piece came out to about $120 which was worth it because of the service and the quality of the food.
The atmosphere of Brio strikes me as classy but not too classy. You don't need to wear cocktail attire, but you should wear a nice button or polo. It definitely added to the experience."}
{"text":"So usually when my hubby craves for Italian dining this is one of our go to restaurants. We celebrated birthdays and one anniversary here. The food is always delishhhhhhh. I love the ambiance of the restaurant. They have a great outdoor firepit sitting areas as well as indoor seating with a view of high ceilings and Italian art on the wall. Waiters are extremely nice n helpful . I would def recommend this restaurant and location"}
{"text":"They ran out of chicken. This place loses a star because they sold something they did not have, and did not let my friend change her order, but instead wait for them to obtain/prepare more chicken, ending with her getting a plate of mashed potatoes and vegetables, and finally offered a to-go box for her chicken (which was ready after we had all eaten and hung out for a little while afterwards). However, I will try to review this place apart from this experience.

Like a typical nice chain from out of town, Brio has all the atmosphere and cool factor you can have in our cookie-cutter buildings. The service is accomodating, willing to join in a surprise party with a slow arriving group. The drink selection is decent, a fair amount of wine but a limited selection of beers on tap. The food is quite pricey for what you get, as I would compare this to a Romano's or Olive Garden in actual taste and quality, though they do get style points for appearance. I enjoyed the food, though, and my friends enjoyed the atmosphere, and that's what counts.

Except for the Chicken fiasco. That docks them a star, because when a situation like that happens, you should do more than expect the customer to wait and pay full price instead of changing orders."}
{"text":"Love this place, something nice for summerlin.  This is a great  restaurant for birthdays, date nights, dinner with my friends etc.  Great service above average for price point in fact.  It is often crowded but always seem to get a seat with no wait unless I'm with a group. Love the mints when you leave.  I have been getting the Shrimp Verdutta which I can't eat all at once but always take home and eat the next day too.  SO good.  I easily would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a nice dinner not over priced.  Just took my parents here in fact."}
{"text":"Food: steak salad, salmon with asparagus, and kids spaghetti with meat sauce. Food was just ok. My daughter didn't like her spaghetti. I tasted it and the noodles were overcooked. My steak was cooked perfectly on my salad, but the rest was meh. 

Ambiance: nicely decorated. 

Service: attentive. 

Location: conveniently in Town Center. 

Too many other options out there, so probably won't revisit."}
{"text":"I love Brio Tuscan Grille. I get the fillet mignon medallions with the Gorgonzola mushroom sauce on them. I love the crackers that they serve with the tables that have flaxseeds on them. And they're one of the few restaurants that have good wines so when I go there I'll actually have a glass. The head chef, Gustavo comes out when he sees me, since he loves the fact that I'm a foodie and I really appreciate his cooking."}
{"text":"First and last time here. Really slow customer service. Took 20 minutes from the time we got seated to even get our drinks in. We finally got our food and it was alright. Nothing that really impressed us. Our bruschetta was really bad though. The bread was stale and really difficult to eat. The lobster bisque was OKAY. I would have left three stars but our waiter was really rude and forgot about us all evening...save your time and money."}
{"text":"Went here for a business Christmas party and the food was good and the service was good. Will go back"}
{"text":"Can't laugh at Brio!! Anna might think your intoxicated and refuse you service... go to Parkway Tavern instead!!"}
{"text":"So the service was still just ok.  Bread before drinks my friends drink was not replenished the same time as ours so he felt like he was experiencing two different dining experiences.   My brio brunch burger had the option of adding a salad for $4.50 extra so I did.   The salad came out literally with just one crouton and it is so tiny for $4.50 this salad is worth .50. Pasta not as al dente as it should be.  I used to absolutely adore this brio and now I won't even go there."}
{"text":"This is a great place to find breaded eggplant and delicious veggies, meat and salad. They use a sauce with their dishes that is just to die for. The service is always great and very attentive. I love coming here for happy hour and it's always a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Very beautiful Italian restaurant w/gr8 food and good service.  Nice wine list and bar menu w/gr8 happy hour.  Pasta dishes, grilled dishes and appetizers are my favorites.  Eggplant and shrimp, beef carpaccio, calamari, ravioli, lasagna, vodka penne and mahi mahi are recommended.   Desserts are average. Service is slow sometimes."}
{"text":"The place
Beautiful interior, can't complain about that.  I'm sure the other reviewers probably do more justice to the description.

The food
The food was tasty, but not outstanding.  The first thing I tried to order was some kind of sandwich with turkey - which I was told was no longer on the menu, hmm.  If it's not on the menu, then why is it on the menu?

The bottom line
A bit pricy but the quality was above average so not too bad.  Dinged one star for out of date menu."}
{"text":"We're visiting Vegas from CA and went here for dinner with friends.  We knew we got a brand new waiter, because another waiter was shadowing him, so we were like....here we go....this should be interesting!  Wrong!  This kid \"Justin\" was GREAT!!!!!  Good hire Brio!  Awesome food! Awesome service!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Cody was our waiter and we had amazing table side service. The meals were perfectly cooked and the bread was warm. We only wished we had room for dessert. Highly recommended as always. The \"go to\" for a great family dinner."}
{"text":"We were a party of two and both loved the meal.
I had the Caesar salad, and it was great.
For my main meal I had Grilled Chicken \"Under The Brick\". Not a morsel of chicken, or the mashed potatoes was left on the plate. So good!
For dessert, they brought over their \"dessert presentation\". I opted to have something that wasn't on the presentation, the Chocolate Layer Cake. It was incredible. This is a no-brainer for next time!
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Lobster rigatoni with shrimp.

cooked lobster too much and it was bit chewy, shrimp was good. Would ask for more seasoning I had to add salt on my plate. Great service and worth to try lomonade"}
{"text":"So okay.  You know Happy Hour at Brooklyn I'd just very awesome! Now I will tell you that lunch is very excellent also.  We had the steak salad.  I recommend it.  Max and Larry handled 2 demanding women and made them leave with smiling get faces. :) can't wait to return to Brooklyn with husbands to taste the delicious good Thank you!p"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic. My wife and I eat here on a regular basis because the quality of the experience has always been so high.

The atmosphere is comfortable, and family friendly even though there is a bar off of the entrance. I would never come here with out a reservation though in the evenings because the wait times are always at least 30 minutes.

The restaurant seems to train their help well since the service levels are high being attentive to its patrons without being annoying.

I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very very very disappointed with this trip to Brio.  We had eaten here several times in the past and the food was pretty good though pricy.  A couple of weeks ago we saw that they had gotten 6 violations on the dirty dinning report but since we had good luck in the past we figured that they would prob be trying very hard to work past that issue.  We went into the bar for there happy hour and the first thing we came across was when the person across from us asked us if we where supposed to get bread while we wait??? She asked the bartender and was told that they had changed the policy that now you have to ask for bread if you want it.  The bread is usually a curtesy at most restaurants how do you have to ask for a curtesy either you give us the bread or not but to have to ask for curtesy bread is insulting.  We ordered some bread and where told it would be a while because they needed to bake some more??? So we ordered some appetizers we sat and waited and waited and waited from my seat I could see the kitchen and I saw what I thought must be our food sitting under the heat lamps where it sat and sat and sat finally the manager called over the server and sure enough it was our food which was of course getting cold and our burgers that where supposed to be medium where very WELL done.  All around it was a very lackluster performance at a time when they weren't even busy.  Our budget for eating out is not as flush as it used to be and the disappointment Of this visit is just irritating and kind of ruined our afternoon.  Don't think we will come back  if we are in the area there are a lot of other restaurants and I don't want to waste my time or money."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here with my husband and in-laws for his birthday. I had the shrimp fettuccini lunch special which I enjoyed. The food was really good and service was average. Just would like to advise management to remind  their staff to inform guests about their loyalty program. I would have loved to join, and the only reason I know about it is from my friend's review!"}
{"text":"I received a message from a \"Bill B\" of Brio who wanted my contact info for what he said was a \"follow up\" by their \"guest services team\". Well that worked about as well as the restaurant because I have never heard from them. Very sad situation and we all know what happens when restaurants like this drop the ball repeatedly !!!!"}
{"text":"Sat at the bar couch for 15 minutes.  Bartenders and hostess walked by us 3 times not even a glance! Wow.  Horrible.  Got up and left to Mexican food place across the street.  Unbelievable."}
{"text":"The service here is horrible! We sat we for 15 minutes before our drink our cane. We had to sit another 45 minutes before our meal came. There restaurant is empty. Nobody ever came to check on our drinks prior to our meal arriving. The meals came and he checked our meal one minute after the meal arrived and never came back to check on our meal or drinks. Our bread (2 servings)was never replaced"}
{"text":"Excellent food....been here 3 times and never disappointed.
Waiters/waitresses explained clearly menu options.

Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner with friends.  We had halibut special,  chicken risotto, cod,  short ribs.  All were good.  Service was good,  nice surroundings.  We have been here several times and will return."}
{"text":"The quality of food at Brio is a pleasant surprise.  The lunch menu has a lot of variety and I probably would have been happy ordering one of 4 or 5 different things, but lasagna wins almost every time, and Brio's version is quite nice.  It comes with your choice of 3 different salads (chopped, Caesar, or house) and I was very happy with the chopped.  Far more than a boring plate of greens, and it isn't drowning in dressing.   The lasagna arrived not long after, and it's made with white sauce, meat, and the usual noodles/cheese/sauce.  I dove in and was a little sad when I took the last bite because for a second, I contemplated ordering another.  It's nicely balanced, has just a teeny tiny amount of burned edges of cheese/noodle.and the meat is moist, like a meatloaf.

Mimosa wasn't anything to get too excited about, but the raspberry gelato (not on the dessert tray) was the perfect amount of dessert.  Allegedly Brio may make its way to California, and I can't wait!  So much better than Olive Garden!"}
{"text":"It's really a shame that California doesn't have any Brio locations.  This was my 3rd time at Brio and just about everything on the menu is excellent.  It's also a great value, with dinner items around $20 per head.  Service has consistently been good, and they do a good job keeping an eye on your bread & drinks, & asking if you want more.  I had the lasagna, which was very good and Mrs. C was extremely happy with her petite filet mignon.  The restaurant is slightly noisy with an open kitchen, so it's also good for families or if you have small children.

Brio is a nice change of pace if you're trying to get away from the buffets, and just 5 minutes from the airport or Mandalay Bay!"}
{"text":"went there for dinner last night, Feb 27. Definitely wasn't bad, but for the price, wasn't great either. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and in a great location of Scottsdale, nice for walking around after dinner. Waitress came to the table and offered us drinks. I asked about the beer and whether it came in 12 and or 16 oz glasses, she said only one size, a pint, OK fine and how much are the beers, she didn't know, really? I ordered the chicken pesto, presentation was very nice, chicken was dry. There are tons of restaurants in the Phoenix area and this is not one I would go back to"}
{"text":"Stopped in at San Tan Mall on a Saturday afternoon with friends.  The ambiance is nice. They have a nice patio but it was too chilly for me to eat outside. Middle of the day so not very busy. We were seated right away and took advantage of the $5 Bloody Mary and Mimosa special.  I had minestrone soup which had a lot of vegetables. I should have had it as an entrée.  It was really good. Yummy! The bread offering was good.  A few different types. My entrée was a chicken and spinach carbonara.  Good.  Not the best I have ever had but good. My friends had a different chicken dish and the other had a beautiful salad, which they both loved! Service was good. Our server was pleasant and attentive. I enjoyed it and would go again."}
{"text":"Love Brio's happy hour and the special Rachel Sangria (ask for it - it is BOMB) ... Ok the bar food happy hour for me is .. Bread Basket, Brio Burger, Ravioli Caprese are the best things on the menu. I am a huge fan of Artichoke dip but this one falls short  as it is too cheesy and not enough artichokes. I give it 5 stars because it is my favorite place for happy hour if you get there early enough for a seat, usually there is a wait. The ambiance is good, good wait staff and my favorite happy hour food & drink is located here."}
{"text":"Good place, not my favorite though. Super busy and noisy. Very crowded!! If you come there with friends and want to enjoy some conversation with them, forget it. Not going to happen. Can't hear each other. That's kind of aggravating.
Also if you are not wine lover, you might not enjoy any other drink that you order. I always order Mi Tai. They don't know how to make it right. Always comes out bitter. Mi Tai is a sweet drink, guys!! A place with a bar should know how to make cocktail!!
The food is good"}
{"text":"I love Brio, it's always reliably good food for an affordable price,  the service is great and always fast.  It can be 1-2 hours wait on weekends for dinner."}
{"text":"Standing in Brio right now. Had 6:30 pm reservations. We arrived 15 minutes early.  It's 6:45 pm right now.  Hostess told us they overbooked and have 15 reservations for 6:30pm and their is two more tables in front of us.  Not the biggest deal if we didn't already have tickets for a 7:50pm movie.  It's a Saturday night,  at this point we are screwed if we go somewhere else.   Did I mention I have 2 starving kids with me who spent all day at a karate Boot camp.   They are not happy and neither are we.  After rushing through our meal, we just made the movie. But we did get front row seats to the movie.

Hey its been 10 months.  Still haven't heard from you.  Guess it wasn't that important."}
{"text":"I love coming here, mostly because of the beef carpaccio appetizer. Sitting outside is nice when the weather allows, and the food has good value. 3 stars cause of the service - the hostess was very rude and we almost left the place on her account , she almost seemed pleased that it's a 40 min wait"}
{"text":"July 2, 2011 Saturday - dinner 8:30 PM
2 adults and a teenager

Atmosphere - 4 stars
Food - 2 stars
Service - 1 star

Background - After a long day of driving from Reno we wanted Italian close to our hotel.

Atmosphere - The best thing going with this place.  Lofting ceilings with great colors covering the walls make for a warm inviting place.

Food
Appetizer - Free bread came in a small basket, it contained three triangular cracker thin bread slices covered in seasoning and a chuck of soft bread.  The cracker bread was seasoned, looked, and tasted like pizza.   They could have offered to bring more bread when it was gone.  If I was eating some pasta as my meal I would have liked it to arrive without me begging. 

Main Course - They did not have any stuffed pasta that I was interested in.  So I went with the sliced steak salad.  The steak was over peppered and the medallion pieces needed to be cut.  The lettuce was nothing special, mostly iceberg chopped into small squares.  The highlight of the meal was the candied pecans.  This comment you could put under service or here, the menu indicates that steak will be cooked to order.  The waiter  never asked and I forgot as it took a long time to place our meal order with him.

Dessert - skipped it  

Service - This was really lacking.  The floor was simply nasty.  Noodles all over the floor next to wear I sat.  As we sat there I noticed a Gatorade bottle on the floor next to me after the lady at the next table over placed in on the floor before they left.  The busy boy must have not noticed it as he kicked it under the table.  I typically only drink water with my meal now, and when you fill a 12 ounce glass completely with ice, you better be coming back with more water frequently.  But not the case here, only once was my water refilled, placing the glass at the edge of the table should all I have to do.   As we were finishing up our meal, a different bus boy took care of the other table next to us.  The table was covered in a table cloth.  When he placed the new one on the table it was like he was making a bed up and down with cloth.  I know it was a hot night but I really do not need a table cloth fan next to me."}

{"text":"I'm a fan!

Came here for an early dinner out on the patio yesterday after work.

I was looking to eat a yummy salad since I'm \"watching\" what I'm eating... 

Wow... the salmon salad is amazing! Super pretty too! Only thing I didn't like was the over drenching of dressing.

I would come back just for the salad... maybe a pasta dish whenever I feel like busting my butt doing 2 hours of cardio post Brio :)


If you're in the area... stop by Brio and have lunch or dinner out on the patio!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Personally I'm not a huge fan of Italian food but we went here for a work dinner. I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Mediterranean shrimp for dinner with the lobster bisque as an appetizer. 
We were in a large group so I understand the service being a little slow, however it was a Wednesday night. The restaurant was not that busy. I don't like when I'm at a restaurant and I have to wait long periods of time for a water or drink refill while I'm eating if the restaurant isn't full. 
The food was great! I absolutely loved the lobster bisque, great texture with chunks of lobster in it. It went really well with the cracker-like bread that came in the bread basket, which was also fantastic. And I never like bread. The Mediterranean shrimp was good, and I was pleasantly surprised because I usually don't pair seafood with cheese. It was a nice light dinner and I was able to finish it without feeling too stuffed. Everyone else at the table ordered pasta and took home leftovers. My neighbor ordered pasta with sausage and it smelled great! 
I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"The worst service. Had a baptism gathering there n had about 40 people and they gave us two servers only n just asking for drinks it would take so long. Also the food they said it was a family size but it wasn't because it wasn't enough for half of the people we had!!! And when asked to bring more it took them more then 20 minutes to bring more food to the table when they should of been prepared!! I'm sorry but I know for next time to not bother coming here anymore!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times.  We were seated pretty quickly each time but each time we had to wait a long time before our server showed up. 

This is fine as the menu is quite large but I'd like to at least have my drink order placed especially on a Sunday when I want a latte and they say that it takes extra long to get it.   

I'm gluten free and they have a gluten free menu which is great but it was very disappointing as it had about 3 items on it.   I know if I come back here I'll just end up \"cheating\" and taking benadryl because it's very slim pickings.  I will say that the gluten free pasta was very delicious and cooked very well. 

I'd rank it a bit higher if the service was better.   I really really hate waiting and waiting."}
{"text":"Got the Grilled Salmon Fresca. The salmon was tasty with a hint of charred. The asparagus had a good flavor and texture but the overall dish arrived luke warm. My sister ordered the Ham & Eggs Benedict. The eggs were over-poached. My cousin ordered the Berries French Toast which was tasty with the maple syrup and warmer than my dish. 

The booth wasn't clean and the plates for the bread weren't clean either which lessened the quality of this place. Go to the one in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!!! Great happy hour, great service, great food, and the ambience is beautiful. Perfect for a date, or just meeting up with the girls for happy hour on the patio. I have been here a handful of times and have yet to be disappointed in anything."}
{"text":"Yum! The bread, the appetizers, the salads, yes! Our server was very funny and when we told him we were eating just apps and salads because we had too much popcorn, he kept joking around and teasing us. He was friendly but not too friendly. He helped us but not too much. I got the salmon salad and it was delicious! I got the dressing on the side and it was even good the next day!"}
{"text":"I have wanted and wanted to try this place since I moved to the area.  Finally decided to go ahead and give it a go.  So, we walked in and got seated right away.  It was not busy at all, as it was 3:00 pm.  It took the waiter a longer-than-it-should-have-taken while to come and take our drink order. Quite a bit longer, he brings our drinks and a bread basket. We asked for extra butter. We order an appetizer and our entrees. Twenty minutes pass and we get the appetizer, which was delicious. We remind the waiter about the butter.  Several minutes later a different waiter brought another pat of butter.  Another 45 minutes pass and our entrees arrive. Everyone thought their dish was alright at best.  After we all stop eating it takes another 20 minutes for the waiter to return and ask about boxes and drops off the check (without asking about dessert).  Another 15 minutes later the waiter comes by and grabs the check.  He brings the credit slips back 5 minutes after.

From the time we entered the restaurant to the time we walked out the door, almost two hours had passed.  That is a long time to wait around for overpriced \"alright\" food. Especially when the waiter seemed to have absolutely no clue what he was doing."}
{"text":"Brio's website says they have \"call ahead seating and take reservations\", I attempted to call at 5 to leave our name, the hostess said there was currently no wait but that could change. When I asked to leave my name she says they are booked until 8. 20 minutes later we arrive and wait 65min. to be seated.

The atmosphere is terrible, tables are too close together. My pasta alla vodka was delicious, although overpriced. My husbands had pork chops which were EXTREMELY undercooked, pretty much raw. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Brio is the perfect place to have that romantic date you've been meaning to have with your significant other.

I went to the Summerlin location for Valentine's Day and was impressed. They take both reservations and walk-ins so lucky for us since we didn't make a reservation. The estimated wait time was 80 minutes? But we actually got in earlier, probably 30 to 40 minutes?

Anyways... We ate outside near a heat lamp which wasn't too bad in today's weather. We ordered calamari as our appetizer which was fine. I mean, it's calamari... Not much else to it. For our entrees, I got the pasta brio which is grilled chicken with rigatoni. My boyfriend got campenelle carbonara which kind of resembled chicken Alfredo. I also got a flirtini - probably won't get that again. It resembled cough syrup to me, but that could just be my taste buds.

All in all, for $67 this was definitely not a bad place for a date. We will probably check out the one in Town Square once the weather gets warmer since they have a fire pit outside.

Happy eatings!"}
{"text":"Review is for happy hour at the bar only. I've been to Brio a couple years ago and although its a beautiful place, the food was forgettable. Better than olive garden, but what isnt? Today was my first time there for happy hour and I may become a regular. 

No drink specials except $5 martinis on Thursdays, but their cocktails are pretty reasonable. However they have one of the best food specials - a nice variety of things for $2.95. We went with the beef carpaccio, pepperoni sausage flat bread, brio burger and shrimp cocktail. I didn't expect much for the price, so it was a pleasant surprise that all of the food was a good sized portion and plated nicely. 

Carpaccio was fresh and served with some greens on top - so perfect for a summer evening on the patio. Burger looked like those preformed Costco patties but it was cooked perfectly medium and yummy with a soft tasty bun. Flat bread was the perfect size for two and the dollops of I'm guessing goat cheese? on each piece was a great finish. Shrimp cocktail wasn't a typical cocktail - cocktail sauce on the bottom with tossed romaine and 4 or 5 ok sized shrimp on top. Everything in it was fresh and good. I'm betting it's a lot better than that sketchy 99cent shrimp cocktail downtown. 

My friends white peach sangria was a little sweet, I loved my strawberry basil lemonade (non alcoholic). There were some issues with the bill re the drinks, but the manager was quick to take care of it. Service at the bar was pretty great - bartender was attentive, everything came out quickly. The manager seemed very hands on. He kept making sure we were ok, that our food was coming and immediately corrected the bill. 

I may have to try Brio for lunch or dinner again soon. Hopefully that experience will be as good as today's."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a chain Italian restaurant and you can taste that. The meals are neither noteworthy or horrible. The last time I went I ordered the risotto with lobster because the waitress said it was one of the guests favorites. I don't know how you mess up something as delicious as lobster and risotto! First, the texture was runny. Second, the taste was just way off. I barely ate any of my $30 dish. We shared a salad beforehand and that wasn't bad. Our friends liked their dishes. I can't recall what they had. So it may just be a preference thing."}
{"text":"love the bellinis & eggplant shrimp!"}
{"text":"I love me some Brio! Yeah I am sure this will be a real balanced review...  At any rate I really enjoy the Brio at the Town Square location and thought I would give this new spot in Summerlin a try for a casual business dinner. I will save you sometime and just let you know it was a real solid choice. The food came out very quickly and the happy hour specials were priced rather inexpensively. Mid way through our meal the executive chef made his rounds and made sure to say hello to every table and introduce himself.  I have to say thats a rarity and the touch was well received.  I honestly have no problems recommending this place to anyone as the bruschetta choices are all amazing, the Veal Milanese was great, the ravioli were cooked to perfection, and the wine list had some great choices for excellent prices."}
{"text":"It's a long wait here , food it's ok nothing that will have me coming back for more, better location at summerlin"}
{"text":"I've gone here a couple times now and been really happy each time. The staff is really nice and polite, our most recent waiter, Matt, was absolutely amazing. He went out of his way to make our son feel included and even brought out some dough for him to play with! We had a great dinner."}
{"text":"Good food, good staff. Great Happy Hour food and prices. Everything is $2.95."}
{"text":"Brio is one of my favorite Italian restaurants.  You're not going to get mama's memorable home cooking from Italy, but it's good food.  Even though most dishes are very flavoable and delish, the lasagna is my favorite.  Great staff that's efficient, and professional.  Plenty of parking in garage.  You may have a wait some nights."}
{"text":"Love the happy hour good affordable prices was able to try everything off the HR menu few times I've went here usually busy at the bar and sometimes hard to find a seat but worth the wait.. Bartenders are very polite and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is a-ok and I'm sort of a fan so I'll round it up to 3.5.  

I don't go out of my way to come here, but occasionally I'll crave some beef carpaccio so I'll end up here.  I've had a few of their entrees and they were all very good.  The risotto here is really tasty and one of my favorites.  My only gripe is the portion.  I've asked servers if they do half portions and they've always responded with an \"I don't know.\"  Don't know how hard it is to ask the chefs if its possible, but apparently it is.  For this reason I rarely ever order an entree to myself because it's such a waste.  I sometimes share one with my dining companion and the portion is enough to fill us both up.  The portions are definitely by the whole \"chain\" restaurant standard.  I think it would be nice to offer half portions for those who cannot devour a whole meal to themselves.

That said, I find myself coming more often just for their happy hour.  It's such an awesome deal.  $2.95 a plate!!!  They have a pretty big selection from their appetizers and the portions are still big enough to share that you won't need one plate for each person.  They also have $5 martinis.  The basil one is tasty but sorta too sweet.  I've also tried the sparkling raspberry and it's not so good.  It tasted like watered down raspberry vodka.  Happy hour is from Monday-Thursday (possibly Friday?) 3-7pm and again at 9-11pm.  

Service is so, so.  Not the greatest but not the worst either.  Sometimes it seems like there's an excess of waitstaff.  I don't care too much of the ones I've gotten, they almost always seem rushed and uninterested.  The bar area is not that great either, but I dont expect much; it's whatevzzz.. can't complain at $2.95 lol."}
{"text":"Opted for a small/quick Sunday lunch at Brio with my two kiddos in Town Square, as it was on my radar of nicer restaurants in Town Square for my fiancé's birthday party reservations later this week. I left feeling pretty disappointed. 

I don't like waitstaff who start out very nice and then snub you when you just order an appetizer and drinks. It was lunchtime, not prom night. Geezus. Our waiter's attitude changed instantly when we ordered a bruschetta, kids meal and drinks. He actually said, \"That's it?\"  He never came back to check on our drinks or to clear dishes. He was in an ass-kissing conversation with the table across from us when he dropped off the check, it was an absolute after thought. 

The bruschetta sampler was delicious, and my daughter liked her kids lasagna, but I won't be coming back thanks to the service. I am not willing to risk putting our group of friends & family through crappy service for an expensive, special occasion dinner. 

I understand that society believes it acceptable to tip off the dollar amount of a meal. This is why waiters get annoyed when you don't spend the big bucks, I get it. I, however, tip off the quality of the service. I believe a customer who orders an ice tea deserves the same great service as a customer who orders a $500 meal. 

Sorry, Brio. Epic FAIL."}
{"text":"I love this place, they and Babbo have restored my faith in Italian food restaurants. The Steak Gorgonzola Bruschetta is one of my favorite things. I've had a few of the pastas as well and they were all delicious. I haven't had a single compaint about any of my visits."}
{"text":"I took my mom and her best friend here when they were visiting from out of town for their birthdays.  I read the reviews on Yelp and decided I'd give it a try.  We had had a bad experience the night before with a server and then Allen L at Brio blew them out of the water!  His service made all the difference in the world to our experience there.  I could tell it was busy, but he never seemed too rushed to answer our questions and recommend items in great detail.  

The food was outstanding, as were all his recommendations.  From the wine, to the food, to the service... Brio was outstanding.  We had the Bruschetta Sampler, Gorgonzola Lamb Chops, & Pasta Pomodoro with Chicken...all were fantastic!! 

Thank you so much!  I'll be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I have been at the place twice! I asked 4 diffrent people for a side! Eventually had to walk up to the bar! I was very dissapointed both times! I even ask my waiter what was wrong his answer was it is what is! Food is decent tho, but do not expect even decent service"}
{"text":"Normally I would not go back to a restaurant I was dissatisfied with. The restaurant in my opinion should always consistently serve good food at all times. After much deliberation, my friends wanted to dine here and I hesitantly agreed and I am actually quite glad that I did agree. 

The restaurant definitely did something different this time. Their pasta was flavorful and tasted great. I ordered the lobster bisque again and it was quite tasty. The service was on point and their bread was delicious.

So the experience definitely changed and the food just tasted better and was cooked very well. I am still a little skeptical to go back because of the previous bad experience but If it came down to it I might just go again. 

Kudos to Management as well, as they sent me a well thought out and professional e-mail about my bad experience."}
{"text":"Seriously love Brio. For most date nights my hubby and I sneak out to Brio. I switch up what I order most times but every time I have really enjoyed it. Every time I get wine, appetizers, a meal and dessert. It never disappoints. I usually ask for the waiters suggestions and it's always so good!!!"}
{"text":"I ate here on Feb 19, 2018, part of a larger group.  We had 4 tables of about 9 or fewer at each table with a pre-planned menu, which was small caesar salad, chicken masala with mash potatoes and broccoli and carrots, creme brulee for dessert, and non-alcoholic drink (coffee, soda, cold and hot tea).  

Service appeared to all of us at my table, anyhow, as very slow and \"inefficient\".  

For instance, they bring us coffee, without any creamer.  After waiting for the creamer a long time, I got up and asked for creamer.   Maybe an hour later, they came to refill the coffee cups but the little creamer cups were empty and used from the first coffee pour.   So I went to the server outside the door, and said \"I like it when we are brought coffee refills, but no one noticed the creamers (tiny one-serving ceramic pitchers) are also empty.\"  The waitress got a little defensive and said that I did not give her opportunity to get the creamers together to bring to the table ..... yet.  

Well, OK.  It took a LONG TIME AFTER WE FINISHED OUR DINNER PLATES, before the dessert was brought.  They were not waiting for our dessert choices, the choice was made by the host before we even arrived, what we are being served for the evening.  However they brought us the creme brulee without giving us spoons to eat it.  This time I waited and did not say anything.   But it took a long time waiting for the spoons (not sure if someone at other tables told them we did not have any spoons) to arrive.  

Now I would think that when they serve the desserts and bring them on a tray, that they would have spoons on the same tray, so we can dig right in, and not have look at the creme brulee for 7 min before we have utensils to eat it.  

The lady had a different and larger salad from the caesar.  I asked her how she got that salad.  She said she told them she does not eat caesar salad, and asked for a \"house salad substitution\", so guess what?   They brought her another caesar salad with same romaine lettuce, but they put the CAESAR dressing ON THE SIDE.   I asked her if it was the same server she asked for substitute salad, as the one who brought her the second salad with the CAESAR dressing on the side.   She said no it wasn't the same person.   I said, \"Oh the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing\", which I found happens at many chain restaurants because it is not the same server who takes the orders, who later brings the food, etc, and the food server does not bring you the tableware (so you get none).   The person who seats you when you first come in, gives you the tableware, so the food server does not \"notice\" that you have no tableware to eat the dish they just brought, cos it wasn't their job to give you tableware.

We could have all gone home much earlier, but the service was so slow.  And the lady who did not want caesar salad, sitting across from me did not get her chicken masala until the rest of us were almost finished eating, some had already packed their leftovers.  

As for the chicken masala, I give 3.5 stars.  It is one of the rare chicken breast experiences, where the chicken was not cooked all dry and hard. That is why I never order \"chicken\" when I go out to eat, cos even places like upscale steak houses \"vulcanize\" chicken breast.   Here at Brio's, it was tender, and had a bit of charbroiled lines and flavor but the masala gravy was very very miniscule.   I asked for more gravy, and our male server brought a large urn, which I happily shared with everyone at our table.  I put the gravy on my mashed potatoes, too, so did other people.  It had plenty of mushrooms in it.   Gravy is 4 stars.  

Creme brulee, when it finally came, and the spoon later arrived so we could eat it, I give 4 stars.   It was really good, but not one of the best I've eaten.  

If I was the host of this group event, I would not book at Brio's again.  Service is the reason for the 2 stars, and \"the service is so bad!\" did not come from my mouth, but was a general consensus, that some of the people at my table, were talking about.   I concur.  I told them that I would be writing this Yelp review."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to Brio, usually never at Town square for longer than a movie at the AMC theater. But my girlfriend and I decided to have a lunch date. I usually have the hardest time choosing a place to eat but though it's been awhile since I've had Italian food.

We get to Brio right around lunch time and get seated quickly, we literally had a round table which seats 5-6 ppl just for the two us! They were very fast at seating people which was good cause you could see they were good with getting people in and out. It's been awhile so when I saw the menu it was limited. One side was the food and the other side your alcoholic beverages. 

We decided to order a lemonade and a mango iced tea, both very refreshing. They give you an appetizer once you are seated of their flatbread and hot bread, very good! We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer, also warm and delicious! For our entrees, my girlfriend ordered a chicken pesto club sandwich and I ordered a cheese tortellini in vodka sauce! I have to say both were pretty good! I just wish I had more of that tortellini!!!"}
{"text":"1.  Two of us went last night at 7:30pm, thought there wouldn't be too much of a wait on Wed night.  Ended up waiting 30 mins, but when they sat us there were plenty of empty tables.  Turns out we were basically the last ones waiting for a table.
2.  We never did get a basket of bread, not sure what the other reviews are talking about.
3.  Only two soup selections ... Lobster Bisque and Cream of Mushroom.  As I'm lactose intolerant ... no soup for me!
4.  Ordered the chicken limone (picata) ... it was pretty good.
5.  Price for two entrees, one soup, one tea, one mineral water .. almost $80 with tip.  A little on the pricey side.
6.  Other reviews mentioned going here for date, disagree!  Way to noisy and not all all intimate.  MUCH better places to take a date."}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour! Great drinks at fair prices and their happy hour appetizers are delicious! Regular meals are a little overpriced in my opinion, but still tasty. Definitely would recommend for happy hour deals and for dinner if you don't mind paying $20-40 for simple, basic pasta dishes. Their portions are huge though so at least you get enough to bring home for next day's lunch."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of the Town Square shopping center, Brio boasts some delicious Italian food without the Strip pricing. I didn't even know Town Square existed until a local from Las Vegas took me here. If you are looking for a restaurant experience devoid of tourists, Brio definitely focuses their attention on the locals. 

It was nice to enjoy a nice glass of wine while paired with my Frutti di Mare, an assortment of seafood with thin spaghetti. It was well seasoned and tasty. Not only was the food good, the impeccable service made the experience quite memorable. Brio would be a good choice especially if you happen to be shopping at Town Square."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting! Superb ambiance!
Lobster bisque is delicious.  The Ravioli is awesome.  Service is always good to excellent.  Entree Salads are huge and wonderful.  I love Brio Tuscan Grill, as do many of my friends from Vegas and St George, Utah."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and food.  Yes the lemonade is as good as they say!!   Great service. Reasonable prices for such great food."}
{"text":"I will never ever waste my time or my money on this Brio or the other one on Rampart and Alta. Both visits were disastrous. The servers were non-attentive, rude and slow. The manager was no where to be found, the food was tasteless. What an over-rated, non-satisfying place to have dinner. Never again..."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Our server was amazing. This is my favorite place when I'm craving Italian. So many choices, and I love that they have dessert shots. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I can't get over their HH deal. It is too good to be true. The best part is that even though it's only Monday-Friday, they honor it on national holidays.

I love their sausage ricotta flatbread and their beef carpaccio. The other stuff I can pass on, but their Tuscan tots are good as well.

it's in a great location so that you can go shopping afterwards with the money you saved from HH. LMAO"}
{"text":"first time here and i was very pleased with it! the service is fantastic and the price point is right where it should be. ended up taking a date here and couldn't ask for anything more. oooo and check out the veal marsala. its fantastic!"}
{"text":"This place will never let you down! Wow! They really do have the wow factor here. From being greeted when you walk in, to great service, exceptional food and drinks and a \"thank you\" on the way out. The customer service sets this business apart from all the rest. Yesterday, 11/11/14, one of many visits, we had warm, fresh baked sourdough bread, creamy lobster bisque, the perfectly salty artichoke dip and the chicken and bacon panini. Everything was phenomenal and came out perfectly timed! We shared the white peach sangria and it was crisp, sweet and refreshing. Our server was a tall male with short brownish blonde hair and he split all of our portions in two for us! What an above and beyond task. Thank you Brio for always making us happy and full!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, good price. Stopped by hear and had brunch. Would 100 percent come again"}
{"text":"This is another example of the special category known as MPLF, or \"Mall Parking Lot Food.\" I would probably pick this over Chilli's, Olive Garden, etc., but only if I wanted to pay more for the same food. The potato chips were good, and the salad was alright cuz I was hungry. It all tasted like it came out of a can though. Service was alright... and the manager was attentive, however I am not in any hurry to ever go back. Unless I'm on a freeway and its the only thing around."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for outside patio seating. Too noisy inside. Good bar service and seating. Food...unfortunately is Super SALTY!!! Always leave there feeling swollen and bloated no matter the choice of food. So good for the drinks and outdoor patio atmosphere, just can no longer eat there since they haven't fixed the problem of using salt as an herb."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. My husband and I went in for our date about 3 weeks ago, Armando was our server. He did an outstanding job. He was very fast, never had our table empty, whether it was refills or more appetizers. He really knew his shit. Unfortunately, the plate my husband likes was sold out and Armando suggested a different one, which was really good!! He could slow down a little when he talks, and he would be perfect but, everything was satisfying!  THANKS ARMANDO!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but even though the food and service is fine, their lack of knowledge and information for this year's Lasagna Day was not. 

In the past, lasagna day was half off their lasagna dish. I called a week ahead to see if this was still true and made reservations when the person on the phone said it was. One week later, we get there and sit down and order. The waiter didn't know about this at all, or what the special was. Before he took our orders, the salads that came with the lasagna were included. And yet after we got the check and I asked about the discount, he said the manager said that the salads were what were given for free. 

Unless they come out with better and more clear announcements so that everyone is on board, not four different people thinking different things, I'll have to cancel the lasagna anniversary. =("}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I know it's a chain restaurant, but needless to say-it's food.
Location is ideal but parking is crap, of course.
Ambiance is nice, we were there for a wedding rehearsal dinner, had the back area reserved for us. 
Service was good, prompt, and attentive.
I don't have anything negative to say.
My bestie-the bride-even left her purse, which they held for her until we were able to make it back.
Good experience!"}
{"text":"We went today for a friends birthday brunch. We made reservations to sit outside. It was a little chilly at 11am, so they were kind enough to bring a heat lamp over to our table. We ordered so much. We started with the Bruschetta sampler. There wasn't a bad one in the dish!! I think for each of us, this stood out as the winner. We ordered peach sangria, mimosa and coffee. The coffee was average, drinks were above average in quality and alcohol ratio. 
I ordered a Greek chopped salad. It was inexpensive and hit the mark. My friend ordered a burger and fries. She said everything was great, my other friend ordered breakfast- eggs, toast, potatoes. She said the potatoes were pretty super. Then we finished it off with mars Capone cheesecake. This was everything I had expected it would be when they showed & explained it to us. 
Everything about this place works for me. Really a perfect place for brunch! Again..... do the Bruschetta!!!!"}
{"text":"On Yelp, 3 stars says \"A-OK,\" and that's what I think of when I think back to our meal at Brio Tuscan Grille. 

The inside of the restaurant is expansive and the architecture is nice, in the way that many Phoenix restaurants are new and designed to look old. I didn't mind it, but it lacked the intimacy that I love from a dim Italian restaurant.

Our server was nice, maybe a bit slower to get us things, but she didn't make it a bad experience. And she definitely sold us on dessert at the end - one of the most impressive parts of the meal!

I got a shrimp dish that was noted on the menu to be \"healthier.\" When you're at a place like this, you know that the butter runs deep, so nothing is really healthy, but I was hoping for something a tad heartier than what I got, which was a small-ish helping of veggies and a few shrimp. Luckily, my dining companions filled my plate with tons of their food - most notably an alfredo dish that was pretty fantastic. And her portion was enormous. So...take that for what you will. Fiancé got a filet, which he loved, so good on them for not messing up a good cut of meat!

Wine list was extensive, but not a lot of by the glass options, if I remember correctly. 

Again, I really enjoyed dessert. We got the \"tasting,\" which I think was a \"small\" portion of 3 or 4 desserts, and I just remember it being massive - like we couldn't finish it all between 5 of us. There were three full size desserts. And it was only $10! Don't make me tell you twice - save room (or don't) and get this.

Wouldn't make this my first stop on our next trip to Phoenix, but wouldn't say no to it, either!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I will definitely be coming back for happy hour!  We had a very nice dinner here.  The kids liked the lasagna, didn't like the burger (I know, why would you order a burger at an Italian restaurant) and my youngest enjoyed her gluten free pasta.  The apps and the meals were delicious and the service was great.  I love when a restaurant has gluten free options as Brio does!"}
{"text":"Really good Italian. Ambiance is great as well. A very short and simple menu, something you find in select places such as this. I've eaten at the two Vegas and Houston locations, and they are all consistently good. Versitile. A great place for a drop in, date, or for a finer flair."}

{"text":"A good time to go is during their Happy Hour. It's Mon-Thurs. 330-630. $5 Martini Thurs. Their HH menu is $2.95 per plate. They do give you pretty descent size portions of food so it's not disappointing. I've tried pretty much everything on the menu. I've also ordered the Dirty Vodka Martini (extra dirty). It's a must after work! :-) All in all, the food, drinks and service was very good!"}
{"text":"I dont even know where to start... the service was amazing. Our waiter Alex was super knowledgeable on the menu and very attentive. He went out of his way to make sure we had a great first time visit. I had the Lasagna and it was perfect. My girlfriend had the Salmon Fesca and shes still talking about it today...The atmosphere there was perfect for our date night."}
{"text":"Was walking by this place one night with the hubby when I saw the outside guest eating some calimari.  It looked so tasty that we had to go and have some.  SO glad that we did.  Not only was the calimari very good but the lobster bisque was good as well.  Wish that it had bigger pices of lobster in it but still very tasty.  
My raspberry mojito was ok.  Raspberry flavor was very weak."}
{"text":"Okay, I get it - Brio is a chain and chains are supposed to be dull, and the menus uninspired. Obviously, Brio Tuscan Grille hasn't gotten that message.

We chose Brio from a host of other restaurants for a Welcoming Dinner for our son's wedding. The coordinator (Tiffany) could not have been nicer and more helpful. She walked us through the menu, choosing insalata, zuppa and entrees as well as passed appetizers. When asked, she easily recommended wines to compliment the other beverage offerings.

Last, but not least, she recommended a couple of bakeries to handle my request for a groom's cake. All of this over the phone or through emails.

Everything was excellent and the waitstaff was extremely attentive. We were able to reserve the Colosseum Room which was perfect for our group. We were able to choose 3 entrees for the group (they printed a menu for our guests) and chose Pasta Brio, Wood-Grilled Salmon and Tuscan Grilled Pork Chops - all excellent from the comments I heard. I can actually comment on the Pork Chop - excellent! We chose the Bruschetta, Beef Carpaccio Crostinis and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp for appetizers and they went over very well - especially the shrimp.

This is a great place to go if you want to escape the Strip. It is located just south of the airport off of Las Vegas Boulevard in Town Square a new shopping area which is quite nice as well. An excellent experience all around."}
{"text":"Good happy hour atmosphere. Dinner w/adults and/or children good too. My favs are caprese salad, risotto, veal Marsala.  Happy with wine choices by the glass. Not a fan of the chicken pomodoro Classico. Children like the pizzas.  I gave 4 stars vs 5...it's just a good place, you know what your getting, but its not overly amazing."}
{"text":"Happy, Happy, Happy Hour.  Tip:  If you want to people watch and sit outside on a patio, go to Brio from 4-6 weekdays. 
Split a Tomato Mozzarella Salad,Vine-ripened tomatoes, fresh Mozzarella, field greens, basil, balsamic drizzle, lemon vinaigrette and Sausage & Pepperoni Flatbread, Ricotta, Mozzarella, Provolone, housemade tomato sauce. Both priced at $4.95 during happy hour.  The flatbread has a great crispy think crust and was tasty.  The sausage was okay, but it  looked like a cut up precooked link?  Salad was fresh and had a good flavor.   If these are the same portions as the regular menu, this was quite the bargain!  
The patio was very busy but the server really hustled and took care of us."}
{"text":"We love the bar! The bartenders are amazing Jasmine and Ken are fantastic! Super quick service at the bar. They were on it! I had my drink with in a minute! Food was great and the service was great! We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere felt nice and I felt like a hot shot.

Then the food came. The chicken was digestible. The fried tomato slices were disgusting and I could not finish them. It is not true about the more butter you put in something the better it tastes.

The tomatoes reminded me of chicken nugget breading from Sheetz.

The desserts that came afterward were well presented, and because they were well presented, I chose one. The crema catalana was delicious, and it came in a small enough portion that I did not feel guilty."}
{"text":"Waited about 30 min until our food arrived.
The food wasn't all that great but good enough."}
{"text":"Happy hour is a killer time here at Brio.  Not only do they have happy hour, but they have reverse happy hour!  I came in for 50% Ravioli, and I found out about some awesome Happy Hour prices of grand total of $3 per appetizer.  1 or 2 appetizers, you are good to go.  I highly recommend the Lobster Ravioli.  It had a spicy flavor with the right amount of sauce and cream.  The lobster inside felt like I was in heaven!

My only complaint of the night that does not give this great place a 5 star is that service was quite slow.  It could have been because of the many patrons during happy hour, but there was not as much detail and attention.

If you are looking for authentic tasting food as though you were in Tuscany, Brio is the place to go."}
{"text":"During my last visit to Las Vegas, we went to Brio twice (Monday & Friday).  They have an excellent Happy Hour with a number of very popular Apps for $2.95ea.  

Very good food and great service...check it out!!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good. We were seated pretty quick with a party of 8. The food portions were bigger than I expected.  The waiters were nice and attentive to our needs.  We ordered a lot of food.  Ambiance is nice and intimate with dim lighting and it can get a bit loud but it's normal.  They also have free ice cream for the birthday girl in our group. Would definitely come back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"My family and I came here during brunch time so the menu was a little different than dinner and not as many options. We got the fish and chips, lobster bisque, pesto chicken club, bruschetta sampler, and calamari appetizer (this was free for checking in). The inside of the restaurant is really beautiful and the staff are all clean and professional looking. They give you bread and butter to start which is always nice! the calamari we got was pretty bland and disappointing because the calamari itself wasn't seasoned and came with marinara sauce on one side and a mayo based sauce on the other side which had a plastic taste to it for some reason. The bruschetta didn't seem to be too popular with the family and the size seemed a bit small for what it was. The pesto chicken club was pretty tasty, the chicken is pounded out thin and well seasoned. The fish and chips were pretty good too, decent size fish filets and crispy French fries. Our server was attentive and really good with filling our waters and clearing the crumbs off our table. Overall this place is just A-ok, but not a place I'd come back to for brunch/lunch."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our 5th anniversary after longingly passing it by it every time we were in the Santan area. 

We're very happy we did because it was a great date. The service was wonderful, our waiter was fast with the drinks and bread, great for suggestions (I ask even when I know what I'm getting to test staff), and above all he was friendly the whole time.

The food was perfect. I had the lobster and shrimp fettuccine, it was everything I hoped for and more. I honestly can't remember much after that because it was all I could think about.

We sat outside during the middle of summer but the misters made it very nice still.

I definitely recommend Brio as a lovely date spot"}
{"text":"Mark our waiter was great! Joe the manager helped me taste white wines because I wanted to get a bottle. 

Our whole table enjoyed our meals, cocktails & appetizers. 

Great menu with choices to suit any palette. 

Two draw backs but we wont mention because they made up for them in spades! 

The only negative was hostess who rolled her eyes and was rude when we had to change our reservations. What happened to smile with service."}
{"text":"Today just wasnt my day, my usual dish i always order (which is my fav) Campanella Cab, was just awful, it had no flavor what do ever, not even the Parmesan could save this dish. I ordered extra sauce to see if that would help but the sauce was so flavorless. The waitor brought it out twice and both time it tasted like water down alfredo sauce. So i just ended up ordering something else, and i should of read the meat description in the lasagna, it had italian sausage, which i hate fennel seeds. So yup my dinner sucked!"}
{"text":"Town Square is always a fun choice. 

Brio has a lot of options to choose from whether you are dining at the bar or in the dining room, you can't go wrong.


They have one of the better happy hours in Town Square. The happy hour menu is a great way to try a variety of items and choose what you like.
 
When the weather is nice... be sure to sit outside and people watch!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry in advance for the review that I'm about to post. ... may no one ever feel like the way we felt yesterday.

I have been to this Brio many times for the restaurant and not happy hour. Yesterday we came for happy hour at the bar because we've heard SOOO many good things about it. We heard that service was good, food was even better, and the drinks were worth it... I mean look at other reviews. I always HATE to be THAT person. SO it cringes me to write this review.

We come in and the bar booths are all full. The tables next to the bar are full. So we opt to go outside. There's one table open but kind of in an awkward spot so we decide to sit at the bar that's located outside. We were sitting there for about 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. We felt like... why isn't anyone coming to us? And there was a couple that had just finished to the right of us. So we knew we were allowed to sit there. Finally, a bar back (not a bartender) actually acknowledges us and gives us menus. Still from there, no bar tender. We decide to go back inside and find a spot inside of the bar. Finally two chairs but still no attention from anyone. We see at least three bar tenders catering to other people. At this point we're thinking \"are we invisible?\" Finally some guy (after about 20 minutes of being there) asks \"Can I see your IDs?\" checks them, and asks if he want something to drink. No hello. No how's it goin. Uh, okay. We order the our drinks and they come out. WE ask if we can order food. I don't know, does he not care that we're paying customers here? We ordered Beef Carpaccio and the new Nachos to start. While waiting for the food I had to get his attention to ask for lemons which took forever to get. I could see them right there, I felt like I could just grab them myself. The food came out. I liked the Beef Carpaccio but it was pretty salty. The nachos weren't nacho chips but potato chips (never seen that before). Interesting. We wanted to get the flatbread but then again it takes forever to get their attention to order something. Finally getting his attention, we ordered the pepperoni and sausage flat bread. Very dry. 

We had our receipt already because he kept printing out the tab every time we ordered something. Okay, that's good at least we didn't have to ask for the check. But paying took forever. My boyfriend had the payment out for quite a long time. No one acknowledge it and finally another person who wasn't catering to us came and grabbed it.

Overall, I was very disappointed with the service and quality of the food. The drinks were okay. And I definitely am shocked to have had a very different experience than all of my friends. I seem to always have bad experience at bars. I don't understand if it's because I look young or what. But that's how it feels most of the time. I promise I'd tip well if you'd treat me well. But this wasn't the case, again."}
{"text":"Went here to meet up with friends on Friday afternoon for happy hour only to find that they do not have any drink specials.  Wtf?  What good are $3 appetizers if I am paying $9 for a glass of wine?  That did not make me very \"happy\".  Also, the bar area was insanely crowded so good luck finding a place to sit.  I really don't get why everyone is so freakishly excited about this happy hour when in reality it is not even a happy hour, they are just running a sale on appetizers.  What a scam!

Once we got a table on the patio we had a pleasant enough time in spite of the fact that our server, Amanda, was god-aweful.  I had a chopped salad that was just ok and also split the Calabrese flatbread with my sister which was quite delicious earned them an extra star, but isn't enough for me to want to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for happy hour in Las Vegas! Everything is a great deal! The creamy shrimp with fried egg plant  is a must! If you want cheap drinks and good food this is a place to stop by... our bar tender the other night wasn't too friendly but whatever we enjoyed each others company and drinks."}
{"text":"One of my favorite valley restaurants and tonight did not disappoint.  It was my birthday and the service was outstanding, friendly,  and attentive. My gluten free shrimp and lobster was delicious and the creme brulee was one of the best I have ever had. Usually we sit outside since they have great seating options but chose inside due to the weather. 
Overall a tremendous night out and just another reason to return as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Tried some of their appetizers during the Yelp fundraising bake sale, and dropped by again for Suki L.'s Happy Hour UYE.  I have to say for the $2.95 price tag on their selections of hour hour menu, the food was delicious and the portions were fair.

My favorites on their new Spring 2011 Happy Hour menu are the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant (the Black Pepper Sauce is great with pretty much anything savory, try it withthe BRIO Burger or the shrimp from the Shrimptini), followed closely by the Marghita Flatbread.  I would also recommend The Beef Carpaccio, BRIO Burger,and as far as their Strawberry Lemonade (non-alcoholic).

If you are not working during the weekday afternoon,and happens to be at Town Square shopping or watching a movie or whatever, drop by for inexpensive and very good food.  But plan on arriving around 3:30pm,as the HH is only valid at the bar area, which fillsup rather quickly.

Thanks again to Suki L for organizing the UYE here, so I try their HH. And like Anthony M, I think this is also one of my favorite HH in Vegas.

Decor: 5/5 It reminded me of the decor at The Cheese Cake Factory, but with their own twist.  Ilike it.

Ambiance: 4/5  It has good atmosphere.

Service: 5/5  The bartenders, waiters,bussers were all great.  Even when it is busy, they paid attention to the customers making sure our orders are placed and our drinks are refilled.

Food:  4/5  Based on the HH menu only.  I liked most of the food I ordered, while some I am glad I tried but would likely not order again now that I know which ones I really like.

Price:  5/5 for HH
            3/5 for non-HH.

Location:  Perfect for those visiting Town Square for the entertainment, shopping, or food.

4 stars. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love the risotto here! So good with asparagus  mushrooms and chicken. The hubby had the huge portion of lasagna. Said it was amazing!! 
We split the Caesar salad. The best dressing I've ever had! The croutons were very good. Not hard but semi soft with tasty seasonings. Yum yum 
The bread basket is good too. 
Beautiful indoor and outdoor seating. They have heaters outside. Not touristy but busy most nights we've been there. I make an online reservation. 
Bar and wine menu is great!
The staff works hard to get your food and beverages to you in a quick manner. Not hurry hurry so you fell rushed. Just that food arrives hot. 
Vegas servers are awesome. They could write the book on how to do a wonderful service to guests in the restaurant world. 
Sorta makes it hard when you go elsewhere as the Servers are not as great."}
{"text":"Their HH is one of the best on town! $5 drink specials! and $3.95 tasters! 

Delicious food that melts in your mouth. HH is available in their bar area and the fire pits. This place is perfect for a Girls Night out, my girlfriends and I ordered everything that was on their menu for HH. I also took my boyfriend here, he loved it. We loved their Crispy Shrimp Piccante, Roasted Garlic, Spinach & Artichoke Dip and Brio Burger. Their service isn't too bad either, our server forgot about our drinks. He apologized and said it was on the house. Good job Brio!.

Definitely looking forward to more Girls Night Out here and a date night's with my leading man."}
{"text":"This place is always solidly delicious. The menu is long enough to have a lot of great options, but not ridiculously epic-noval-ish enough to make you want to give up (Cheesecake Factory, that's you, buddy, but I'll still come visit every once and a while when I can't decide beforehand on a particular type of food I want at the time). The servers are nice and the patio is awesome, when the weather's right. The inside is a large, mostly open space that can get a little loud-ish during peak times, but not so unbearable that you have to yell to your eating companion(s). The price is what you'd expect to pay: not the cheapest, but not that pricey, either; I consider it a slightly less-expensive alternative to my other favorite Vegas/Henderson Italian joints, Casa di Amore, Nora's, and Gaetano's."}
{"text":"Love Brios. My friends and I always do birthdays and Happy Hour at Brios.
Amazing Happy Hour. Love the service and the food."}
{"text":"After wanting to try Brio for so long and hearing about their good food, we finally came here for dinner the other night. It looked a little busy for a Tuesday night, but thankfully, we only had to wait a few minutes before being seated. The first thing I noticed was that the place was very loud. Also, the tables were pretty close to each other. We sat next to a party of 4, who was obnoxiously loud, swearing, and complaining about their jobs all night. It was like we were being forced to listen to their conversations. Not the restaurant's fault, but just an FYI, you may want to request a booth or a table outside instead.

Service was a bit slow at first. One guy showed up to give us our basket of bread and butter (loved the sourdough bread), but our server kept us waiting for about 20 minutes. She actually turned out to be very nice and attentive, so I guess I can forgive the wait. :p At first glance at the menu, I was a little worried that I wouldn't be able to find anything to order. I love Italian food and pasta, but all the dishes seemed complicated for someone who is very picky as myself. My order was about to sound like this, \"Can I have the Chicken Pomodoro Classico with no tomatoes, pine nuts and basil?\" Then, I spotted the only pasta dish with ingredients that I actually liked! Surprising, I know. I had to look twice just to make sure. 

The Campanelle Carbonara had grilled chicken, bacon, Parmesan cheese, spinach and Alfredo. Sold! Our dinners came out about 10 minutes after ordering. My pasta was very flavorful and not salty. The chicken and bacon were cut into perfectly bite sized pieces. The Alfredo sauce was just right and not overpowering. My husband ordered the Roasted Lamb Chops and said they were very good. I never liked lamb. I tried it at Texas de Brazil and didn't like the taste it left in my mouth. However, these lamb chops did look good with the red wine sauce it was served with. For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu, which was delicious as well. A perfect balance of coffee and creme flavors. They also have a gluten free and light menu.

It looks like they have a MyBRIO loyalty program that you can join for free. According to their website, you get a complimentary appetizer valued up to $10 as a welcome reward. Our server didn't mention that to us at all, so I guess I'll have to remember to ask about it the next time I am there. Brio is a bit on the expensive side, but I would definitely want to come back every so often. The food was awesome! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Have been here many times as I live close by and it is convenient. I always get a decent meal for a chain.   

Three of us went this past Saturday for dinner and two of the three of us had downright lousy meals. The side of pasta on each of our dishes had no sauce as we requested, but worse than that, it was over cooked and one hard clump. The server got us some sauce to try to remedy, but the  meat (one of us had chicken and the other lobster) was overdone and dry.  Clearly, the kitchen was not doing a good job this night. 

Our server was friendly. The manager tried to make it up by comping dessert which none of us wanted, but I really think they lost a customer after tonight's weak presentation and performance."}
{"text":"So I have been to this place a couple of times with friends and sat outside at the patio both times. The inside restaurant I would say is beautiful and has nice ceiling decorations.. very high and fancy with the long drapes above. Hosts are nice and friendly. ambiance of place is casual but also a upscale feel to it. Pricing isn't too bad as well. 

So the last time i was there I ordered a risotto dish with lobster on top!  the presentation of the dish was amazing!! beautifully done ...I adjusted some ingredients on there and they accommodated it all. I also had the crab cakes and it was delishh! the creme brûlée was yummy as well! Service by the waiter ..hmm he just doesn't seem interested in serving us. 

Another time I came here I ordered a Alfredo pasta with blackened shrimp on the side.. the shrimps were good. BUT the pasta they gave me was DRYER than the desert! I had to wave down the waiter help to ask him for extra alfredo sauce... which he called a manager over and he had it sent out shortly after. Manager was quite accommodating and nice. The waitress we had was OK i suppose but hardly around for service.. we literally would flag down anyone we saw walking by... 

Overall what i would say about this restaurant is that the ambiance is nice.. if I'm in the area i would def come back. Food is tasty for the most part.. but service is something I have never been fond of!! hopefully management or corporate can see the review and make sure that the waitstaff IMPROVE on the level of SERVICE they provide for every customer that comes into the place. It seems like they pick and choose who they provide good service to. Smh...."}
{"text":"Three of us had a brunch today. Two of us ordered the Brio Hamburgers and one of our group ordered the Sicilian Omelet. The omelet was very tasty, but two of us got sick eating hamburgers.
Presentation- 8 out 10
Hamburgers were so dried and burned. A lady (she looks likes the manager of the Brio) asked us, if we ordered medium well. The server never asked us how our burgers like to cook. Arugula were wilted, French fries were too salty and hamburgers had no seasoning.
Sadly we wouldn't order the hamburgers any more.
Beautiful place and rotten hamburgers"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go back Brio to eat. Because I had a bad experience @Brio in Tivoli.
Seven of us to celebrating out dear friend, Julia.
This time, I was very wrong.
All of our meals were delicious and superb, our server, Jessie, was so wonderful!!!
I guess everyone deserves to have a second chance.
I am glad I went and had a marvelous time with my dear friends."}
{"text":"This can be a great restaurant IF you order right.  I previewed the menu and reviews first and had the shrimp and eggplant appetizer as my meal.  It's heavy, but oh so good!  I'm kind of a vegetarian except I won't give up seafood. And, I LOVE eggplant so this was perfect for me."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Maybe they were having an off day, but it was as if they were barely keeping the wheels on the cart when we were there. I always enjoy drinks, apps, entree, dessert when on vacation and out with friends --- not here!  Not that we were in a rush, but they definitely were not. Forgot salad, overcooked eggs, double charged for entrees. There are many other options to choose from when in Town Square."}
{"text":"In Westlake on business and wanted a good Italian dinner with friends so we chose Brio despite some of the lackluster reviews.  All 5 of us really enjoyed our meals from the salads to the various pasta dishes to the small deserts that were just perfect to top off the meal.  The portions were plentiful and very flavorful, the wine selection was very good and the drinks were fixed just unimpeachable.  The atmosphere, service, and presentations were also first rate.  We all said we would return."}
{"text":"A good place for all occasion and season. Nice and friendly staff. Good food and quick service. A great place for a friendly gathering."}
{"text":"AWFUL calamari was rubber and my salad had a hair in it!!! Over all I was disturbed . I do not want to sacrifice my health for a meal!!!!"}
{"text":"I was shocked was told how great place this was and just need to go. So I did and it sucked. The food was cold there was five of us one meal came out fifteen min later  the manager was very rude. I will say the server we had was amazing she Jessica you rock I hope they know she has a good one here."}
{"text":"Great place for a happy hour date! Had shrimp and eggplant appetizer. It's a must! A good selection of wine. Gets very crowded at night."}
{"text":"This place is a local jewel. A glass of wine, a nice appetizer and you're set. This place can get busy during dinner hours, be patient and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good ambient but reservation means nothing. You still have to wait for the next available table. 
Lobster bisque is good but only half a bowl."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service we have ever had in Vegas. Server forgot silverware, didn't bring it even though we asked her to, and basically forgot about us the entire meal when it was not busy. We will not be returning and my husband felt he completely wasted money on lunch here."}
{"text":"Great staff and delicious food. 
Been here about 5 times and they never fail to meet my expectations they really do know the meaning of Great customer service."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. It has fantastic food but my friends/family will never give them our business again. If you want to find a great Italian restaurant in the area I would try Babbos Italian eatery!"}
{"text":"I have come to Brio several times and each time my meal and the meals of those I am with is solid. Came here with my parents and my boyfriend during the holidays. Here's the breakdown:

Atmosphere: Gorgeous! I love the decor of this restaurant and it's high ceilings. It's always decorated so lovely during this holidays.

Food: Overall, good.

Calamari- bland. It needed the accompanying sauces to make it have any flavor.

Spinach & Artichoke dip- very tasty, although the crackers that come with it are not a good match for the dip. The crackers are asiago cheese crackers and the asiago conflicts with the cheese in the dip. I ended up just getting more bread and using that with the dip. It was much better. 

Chopped Salad- Tasty, but very onion heavy. Don't go kissing anyone after eating this salad!

Lasagna- delicious. Cooked perfectly. 

Service: Just AWFUL. Our server NEVER came by. Our meal took over 2 hours. It was ridiculous. Now, I could have understood if the place was crazy busy, but it really wasn't. You know it's bad when you have to ask the busybody multiple times to get our server. We got there around 8pm and didn't leave until well after 10pm.

Prices: Very fair. The portion size and quality is in line with the prices.

Overall, I will come back to Brio for their food and atmosphere, but if I get seated in the section of the server we had again I am going to request to move to a different table, as I have a life and would like to get to it someday, rather than spending it at a 3 hour dinner."}
{"text":"My mom and my sis and I came here on New Years Day for brunch.  Although, the place was pretty busy, our server was very friendly.  Our food came out a little slow and we didn't order anything complicated.  I had their grilled salmon, which was cooked to perfection - delicate and moist.  My sister and I also ordered their Bloody Maryl, which was also very good. We really enjoyed our visit here.  Hopefully, Tivoli Village will fill up soon to bring more people to Brio and the other restaurants.  Right now, there's really no shops to go to around there."}
{"text":"Celebrating an early Mothers Day, shared the Lasagna Bolognese, Salmon Griglia, Tuscan Grillled Pork Chops, Pasta Pesto and Calamari Fritto Misto. Large serving of  Lasagna and very traditional, while the Pork Chops were very tasty and prepared well. The salmon and pesto were from the \"light menu\" which were small portions. Everything was prepared and presented very well.  
The service was very good and the restaurant has great atmosphere for a nice evening. 
Would recommend this for a nice relaxing evening"}
{"text":"My husband, daughter, and I were checking out the beautiful newly opened Tivoli Village last Thursday, and Brio Tuscan Grille was one of the few restaurants that were 1.) already up and running and 2.) had a wait less than 20 minutes during the lunch peak hours.  

The service was FANTASTIC, and that is probably because they just opened and are still in that \"honeymoon\"  phase.  Along with crayons and the kids menu to color, they also brought Pizza dough for my daughter to play with. They even offered to cook it for her when she was done- but she was having too much fun just playing with it. 

I have never been to a Brio Tuscan Grille before so I had no expectations.  In fact, I didn't even know it was a chain restaurant at the time. Nonetheless, I am a fan of the food.  I ordered the Fettuccine Rustica and I highly recommend this dish if you like sun dried tomatoes.  I added the Bistecca Ensalata for an additional $3.95 and this salad was a meal in itself.  It was so delicious and so filling- I may just get a whole order of that next time since I am a sucker for gorgonzola cheese and bacon!  My husband ordered the chopped salad to start with and the Shrimp and Crab cakes.  It had only come with 2 average sized cakes, but they were so flavorful and surprisingly quite filling.  We ordered the kids lasagna for my daughter, and for $4.95- this was practically an adult serving.  In fact, the three of us shared it because it was that big, and that delicious! 

The dessert display looked too fabulous to pass us, so I ate about 1/4th of my delicious pasta and had the rest packed up to take home.  We ordered the creme brulee and the raspberry cheesecake and both were the perfect way to end such a satisfying lunch.  The total bill for the 3 of us was less than $50. And it was well worth it- the ambiance, the service, the food were all great."}
{"text":"I love this place and am a pretty loyal customer.  I try to hit it every time I'm at San Tan especially during happy hour when I feel the urge for Italian.  Not a single complaint from me so guessing they'll be no private messages from management with a possible freebee....LOL"}
{"text":"Time to time we escape from the hectic strip to Town Square, relaxing atmosphere and this time was no different. Outdoor sitting with nice view and the food was very good. Party of six we all had different items and all lined their choice. Soups and bread were excellent. 

Service was a bit rushed and not caring... asked if we want the beer after the soup but didn't care about the answer. Glass with clearly visible lipstick type mark made to the table and replacement still came before the soup."}
{"text":"Ate there Sat. night, party of 10, for a birthday.  LOUD, terrible service.  Waiter took 3 tries to get us right check, waited 15 minutes for coffee service and never brought the pot back for refills.  Lobster items ordered by 3 of group had no lobster in them!  Waiter ended up bringing bits of lobster to table separately.  Agree with other reviewer that food was cold by the time it finally reached the table.Veal was so over salted that it was unedible!  This was for both of the people that ordered veal.  The cod was over cooked and also unedible.  I believe there was confusion on part of wait staff as to who was handling the table.  The peach bellinis were wonderful, however.  NO WAY would I ever go back.  Sad, because it is a beautiful place with a decent menu."}
{"text":"So sad! We wanted to love this place! Went for brunch and had the most annoying server... Finally ordered (we couldn't make up
Our minds) and I opted to start with a salad and artichoke dip. Dip was okay. Nothing special. I'd love to mention the salad but it never came. Got the spicy chicken bacon sandwich. BEWARE it tastes like chipotle sauce and mayonnaise only! It was the most awkward tasting item is ever had before! French toast was underwhelming as well. Very tart with some gross lemon filling. But the fruit and syrup were delicious. Which we had to ask for syrup from three different people. Bc we were still hungry we ordered a side of scrambled eggs... Which took twenty minutes to arrive. Then I had to go to the bar for ketchup. It was just an overall poor experience. We wanted to love this place. The patio is very nice to enjoy! We had a great time people watching!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a chain type Italian restaurant forget Olive Garden and come here. The food is creative without being fancy. Everything is fresh and tastes great. Good happy hour prices for appetizer (drinks not so much). Happy hour service was a little rough, I really hate when bartenders ignore younger patrons, but the $2.95 appetizers still made it a good deal. I love their Italian Wedding Cake Martini!"}
{"text":"I just had my last supper here.  Okay, not a last supper but I wanted to indulge on copious amounts of carbs prior to trying to lose some of the inches around the diameter.  They didn't disappoint.  I wish I could tell you the exact name of the dish that I ordered but it was chicken and penne pasta, anyway it was delish.  And the wine they brought over was a perfect pairing.  My friend who was with me did not like her breaded chicken dish at all and tried to swallow it down.  I let the waiter know since she was unwilling to speak up but she didn't know what else she wanted.  He said, \"Do you trust me\" and she affirmed.  \"He said, I've got just the thing for you and you won't be disappointed.\" And she wasn't.  The mini desserts in little Turkish coffee size cups (e.g. Tiramisu, Creme Brulee) etc were perfect for those who don't have any more room for the Big Boy Size confections but could slide in a bite or three amidst the now expanding pasta in one's stomach.  We finished the meal outside taking in the great Vegas weather and the delightful ambience that is Town Square.  I've been there before, I'll go there again.  I'm a fan."}
