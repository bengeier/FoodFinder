{"text":"I really liked the atmosphere but was a little disappointed in our meal. The clam chowder was good as was the spinach salad. The crab cakes were good but the sauce was not. tasted like straight horseradish. My husband had scallops-just ok and I had the coconut shrimp-ok. Our rice was so undercooked that it was crunchy and uneatable. We won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Captain Bill's last night.  We sat near the fire and we enjoyed the warmth and atmosphere.  We had the clam chowder as a starter and it was spicy and really good.  Not a typical chowder, but a very welcome surprise.  For dinner, we split the seafood sampler appetizer platter which includes a crab cake, coconut shrimp and calamari.  We enjoyed the coconut shrimp and crab cake very much.  The calamari was a tad chewy, but still good.  They have a nice drink and beer selection and the service was great.  We also appreciate Captain Bill's participating in the dining for DAIS (domestic abuse shelter in Madison) last night.  I recommend eating at Captain Bill's"}
{"text":"We stopped in while boating.  We were excited to sit outside, have a few drinks & appetizers.  The atmosphere is great, drinks & calamari good.  However, the service was really bad...menu is limited in the app department.  We had to track down the waiter more than once.  We also had to ask for napkins/silverware & weren't offered plates.  Looking forward to the Edgewater Pier to reopen.  We won't be going back to Captain Bills."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it.  I really did.  I want to support independent \"original\" restaurants here in Madison.  And I had a $10 coupon.  So I thought the fam and I would give it a try.  This may be one of the worst restaurants in Madison I have been to.  Complete tourist trap.  The service was poor.  Our waitress was nice enough but just sloppy in general.  A table of two sat down 15 minutes after we did.  They waited atleast 10 minutes before one of them flagged down a waitress, who came over, asked for their drink order.  They ordered their drinks and appetizers.  Neither came within 20 minutes.  They got up and left.  I felt absolutely horrible for them.  We ordered two kids meals, I ordered the fish fry, and my wife a tilapia.  I did get a cup of clam chowder.  The clam chowder was the only decent tasting dish, but that's probably because it had a stick of butter in it.  My fish fry was easily subpar, my wife's dish was cold and very bland.  My kids.... liked their french fries and chicken tenders (what kid doesn't?).    The view here, if you can call it that, isn't that impressive, even though they label themselves as \"Madison's only lakeside restaurant.\"    I will never go back, unfortunately.  This place seems very much like a tourist trap with mediocre food at above average prices.  *sigh*  And I just read the Madison Magazine's \"Best\" and this place was voted #3 for seafood!?  Just goes to show that that Magazine is not about objectivity but about \"who can get people to vote the most.\""}
{"text":"Yep, I signed up for Yelp specifically to review this place...  My wife and I have 4 daughters, and we rarely get a chance to get out of the house. We called all over to reserve a table for restaurants participating in \"Restaurant Week\", and none of them were available for our time slot besides Captain Bill's. So we went, and it was easily the worst dining experience we've ever had in Madison, and we've both lived here for 20+ years...  She went for the steak ordered medium rare, and it came to her completely raw on the inside. Trust me, I'm a cook, and I know the difference. This is NOT just an uninformed consumer who has no idea. I got a lobster tail that came with no butter, and tasted like the outside of crab shells smell. The best part of the meal was the clam chowder, which came in a coffee cup.   The service was very unattentive and slow, even though it wasn't even busy. While I went to the rest room, my wife informed me that one of the young servers came out, put a plate down for a woman, then licked some food off his hand on the way back to the kitchen.   I'm not being a jerk here, but this was bad. Especially for the restaurant week prices which was $25 per person and I'm very sure we would have been better off going anywhere else on the list. What I've heard from other people since I've told them about our experience is that \"the fish frys are good\".  I'll never know."}
{"text":"Very average. Service was good, though we had to wait a long time. Food was ok. Overpriced, in my opinion. I had the shrimp nachos as my dinner - fried shrimp on top of nachos with a tiny, tiny bit of cheese, sour cream, and guacamole. Very bland and dry. The \"salsa\" that came on the side tasted like it was diced tomatoes straight from a can, no \"salsa\" flavor to it. I don't see what the hype is about."}
{"text":"On Friday August 8 at 7:00pm myself and a guest had dinner at your establishment and we were, to say the least, let down. And when I say we were 'let down' I mean, from the moment we walked in the door.  It looked interested, cute and cozy from the outside and as we walked through the doors, but the lack of organization was very clear. Granted, we may have come at a dinner rush, there was no order. Nobody seemed to know where to stand, it was getting crowded by the minute, people butting in line to get to the hostess so their reservation was made known. Others forcing themselves to the front to try to get a table. Almost complete chaos. My guest and I stood silently at first, right in front of the hostess' stand. She looked right by us numerous times till finally we had enough of people's lack of courtesy.   The hostess was rude right off the bat. We made it clear we had a reservation at 7 pm, so we had no wait, however, you could tell she was frustrated with everyone around her, she didn't know what tables were clear, she didn't have a clue where to put anybody so she sent her servers to seat people and IF she had to do it, she went off in a gigantic huff and nobody was sure if they should follow her or cower in the corner.  By the time we were seated (a good 10 - 15 minutes later, WITH a reservation) we chose outside, which again was cute but crowded, the tables looked nice, but we were put up against the railing basically touching knees with the people beside us. It's a good thing we don't have a personal space issue because that would have been violated.   Our server was prompt to get to us at first and get our drink orders and order, but once the food came (I had crab cakes and my guest had the shrimp scampi) we didn't see the waitress for another half hour or longer.  In that time another couple was seated next to us. They had time to order drinks, order an appetizer, order their food AND finish their main meal.   Finally, our waitress appears, asks if we need anything more, I said just the check and she left and was back shortly after with the check. (we should have had the card ready for her to take, because little did we know, we would be waiting another 20 - 30 minutes just for her to come grab the payment.  In that last amount of time, us sitting, twiddling our thumbs, listening to a group on the other side of us, talk so loud we couldn't hear each other across the small table. The couple next to us was also, sitting waiting for the check, discussing how our waitress must have gone home for the night and we should just leave. (we also found out that the couple next to us, didn't even get a beer their had ordered previously, or even have anyone check on them, once)  Granted, the thought of leaving was a very real option in my mind, I'm not one to 'dine and dash'.   I eventually took the bill inside and up to the bar itself, the bartender was very nice and courteous, she helped us right away. She explained that our waitress was overbooked and honestly just didn't have time to get to everyone promptly, which isn't her fault by any means.  In regards to the food, it was decent. Not great but not good. The scampi was simply 6 pieces of shrimp, in butter. A tiny plate of everything. I wouldn't say it was worth the $83 dollar bill we had.   I would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I dined here about a year ago. My mother asked the waiter how he was when he greeted us and he said something like \"not that great really\" and we got off on the wrong foot. We were served overcooked coconut shrimp that was partially burned on the bottom (I don't know why we did not return it) and the entrees were just okay.It was a real disappointment as I thought it would be a nice evening out. Is it wierd that most of the people who liked the restaurant are from California?"}
{"text":"From this Fall..... Ah, our 1st choice was closed so when we got to the front door of Captain Bill's  and discovered it was locked, I was really hungry and willing to go for fish and chips at Long John Silver.......or even a burger joint..... but WAIT.........a man with keys saw us and opened the door.  He explained that they didn't really open for another half hour but saw us outside while passing by....\"if we didn't mind waiting in the bar for a bit...\"  Turned out to be a GREAT IDEA.  Nautical themed with a GREAT view of the lake through large picture windows (and outside seating when warmer), a flying saucer-shaped fireplace in the middle of the room, and a bartender who dropped his setting-up-routine to serve us instantly....and on the house too!  \"I think we can suffer through the wait\" I said to my friend, wishing HE was a SHE.  Perfect romantic environment.  So while wistfully gazing out at the lake and dreaming of imaginary female companions, Mr. Key Man returned with a plate of munchies from the fryer, \"to tide us over, on the house.\"  Maybe I'll never leave this place, I thought.  Wonder if they serve breakfast?  (NO, they don't.)   Well another beer or two and time passed quickly.  The place was filling up fast so we dashed into the dining room.  Same beautiful views.  Clam chowder was A-1, coconut shrimp as well.  My walleye was hot and flaky and seasoned perfectly.  He apparently like his crab since he couldn't converse with a constantly filled mouth.  I don't get the reference to Red Lobster from another reviewer, and the others who were disappointed (ok, I admit my rice was overcooked)...and while it may be pricey by Madison standards, I found it rather reasonable by Chicago standards.  Besides, you can see the other side of their lake if you squint past my imaginary girlfriends......try doing THAT in Chicago."}
{"text":"As far as I remember, it was always exciting for my family and I to come to this restaurant because of the great seafood and wonderful view at the patio. A few years passed by and oh well, things have changed a lot since that time.  I have been there twice this month, what dragged me there the second time? music playing on the patio and that way I could get accquainted with their food once again and see if it was worth it to come back.  Let's get into the food, should we?   * Grilled Salmon with a citrus compound butter, no citrusy flavor at all, thank God for the piece of lemon they put on the plate and like if that wasn't enough, there was a cherry on top: Overcooked, wow.   *Coconut Shrimp with a side of honey mustard (that was the key ingredient that tied everything up), shrimp was well cooked, however, the breading was kind of greasy.   *Scallops with a Champagne Cream sauce, it sounds fancy and delectable right? Big dissapointment, scallops were a little bit gritty, absolutely bland and it tasted like if it was just defrosted. Sauce was not even remotely close of being delicate, all I could just taste was heavy cream.  They always bring great bread (from Madison Sourdough) to your table. Also, I had to say their clam chowder was tasty. Servers were nice both times.   Another thing I noticed was that their menu does not inform customers well of the sides that come with the entrees, it just says you have a choice between a salad and soup and then a starch, that's all, both times I had to ask what kind of starch they offer, they should add that to their menu.   To be honest, it makes me sad that this restaurant has potential and that they don't do anything about it. I can't believe a seafood restaurant don't put a little bit more effort to make their specialty shine through. It is an expensive place, make us feel your food it's worth every penny please so that we keep coming back. At the moment I don't feel inspired :("}
{"text":"Our family tradition is to go to Captain Bills during both restaurant weeks. Last week concluded restaurant week and I have to say I was deeply disappointed for the second time (the last time was over the summer). I get that we are getting a good deal during restaurant week but come on and up the customer service. The servers act as though they are not interested in waiting on us and when the food comes out it is cold and lacking flavor. I'm not sure if they are under new management since we have only had this experience over the last year but get it together. It is expensive to eat there and our family tips off of the original price. Train your servers to treat every customer with respect. Respect and care is what is lacking."}
{"text":"An excellent seafood restaurant, family-owned by three brothers, set on a lake. Nice setting, spacious with dark, atmospheric nautical decor - very nice! This is a much more personal experience than a chain. The coconut shrimp is a must.   Great bar with a big open firepit, warm and cozy on cold winter days. Outdoor seating, free parking lot, so much more spacious than the LA restaurants I usually see. A definite yes!"}
{"text":"For a Saturday night, it was sure far from busy.  I ordered a crab cake to start things off and it was a nice size but room temperature which pulled it down from 5 stars to 3.   My husband had the walleye and a baked potato which he said was good, nothing outstanding.  I had salmon which came on a cedar plank and that was above average, while the garlic mashed were about room temp.  Not sure if it was the fault of the kitchen for not getting all the food on the plate at the sme time or our server.  Might go back again if the mood to go out hits and it's too late to get a reservation at a place we like better."}
{"text":"The clam chowder is good.  Ciabatta rolls with different spreads (olive, cheese, and garlic) was a nice touch.  Things went sideways after that.  $24.99 for 4 pan seared scallops with broccoli and baked potato...yikes.  The scallops were terribly gritty, undercooked, flavorless, and cold by the time they reached me.  My wife's stuffed tilapia ($19.99...ouch!) was akin to a Lean Cuisine.  It was okay, but definitely had that freezer taste to it.  Not bad, not good, just food.  When the waitress came around to ask how the food was, I hesitated a little and just as she was halfway turned to walk away, but still right next to me I said, \"I'm sorry, I just have to be honest...\", and she didn't turn back towards me to ask what the problem was.  Prior Yelpers have it right, this place really doesn't have any interest in feedback from its customers.  All in all, the atmosphere is okay, the clam chowder is good, but the price of their absolutely mediocre mains will keep me away from this place in the future.  I couldn't bring myself to give this place even a 2nd star.  Sorry : ("}
{"text":"Captain Bill's, a seafood restaurant set just outside of \"downtown\" Madison, WI was an excellent discovery.  The inside reminds you of an old ship with wood paneled walls, fishing nets, buoys and other nautical paraphernalia.  One room features a large central fireplace that creates cozy setting on freezing Wisconsin nights, and there is also a seasonal outdoor patio that provides pretty views of Lake Mendota.  The food is excellent, and reasonably priced for the amount and quality that you're given.  I've tried several of their entrees (king crab legs, the steak, shrimp sampler etc) and have never been disappointed.  For those not interested in seafood they also offer a variety of chicken and pasta dishes.  If you go you MUST get the clam chowder, crab cakes and coconut shrimp.  They're award-winning and featured on the Food Network for a reason!  Go to Captain Bill's.  It's excellent."}
{"text":"We went here because we like local places that aren't chains. In that respect, this place fit the bill. The atmosphere was quaint. The portions we're generous, but the food was unremarkable. When we asked for fresh ground pepper, they didn't have a pepper mill! Not so sure we'll go back."}
{"text":"Bummer  This evening we tried Captain Bill's for perhaps the third time in the last five years.  The promise of a $10 discount from our member card for Wisconsin Public Radio motivated us to try it again even though our prior experiences have not been good.  Alas, history repeats itself.  My wife had the coconut shrimp; they were large enough but overcooked.  My grilled Mahi Mahi would have embarrassed Long John Silvers.  Well, maybe not, but certainly Joey's does better for a less money.  The broccoli was ok, only slightly overdone, but the rice was horrid.  The one plus was the dinner salad.   It the summer Captain Bill's has outdoor seating with a obstructed view of Lake Mendota.    In short, if you want to see the Lake and eat fish you'd be better off to pick up a tuna sandwich at Subway and go to Mendota Park just a few blocks away."}
{"text":"Great foccacia with 3 different flavors of butter (garlic, pumpkin spice, port wine). Loved the coconut shrimp and the house-made cocktail sauce. The clam chowder was intensely rich -- too rich for me, and rather like the peanut butter of clam chowders. Nice and chunky though -- they don't skimp on the clams. We got the seafood sampler for an appetizer; the fried calamari was light, crisp, but a little too salty. The crab cake texture was fantastic, but the flavor a bit mayo-y. Also had the lobster pot pie, which was a little overcooked but tasted OK.  Went on a quiet weekday night. Clientele mostly elderly; cute, themed ambiance. Plenty of parking. We'll probably go again, but only because we missed out on the view (it was already dark), and steer clear of the intensely rich/creamy menu items!"}
{"text":"Great location and views of the lake but the food needs some work and the service could be better. I order the Captain's Fries and they were soggy and limp, as if they had been fried yesterday. There wasn't any crisp to them what-so-ever. The \"Aioli\" tasted like it came from a food service can. I expected better from this place."}
{"text":"My family came here for my husband's birthday - what a disaster!   We were seated by a table by the window, overlooking the lake (everything good so far...). The trouble started early when we had to 15 minutes for the waitress to come to take our drink orders. Another 20 minutes for the drinks to arrive. And after our drinks arrived yet another 10 minutes before she came back to take our order.   40 minutes after we ordered we got salads/soups. I got a salad, which was good. My husband got the chowder - which was amazing!   We were left with our salad plates sitting in front of us for the 20 minutes it took our food to arrive. And we kept having to go refill our drinks at the bar since our waitress was nowhere to be found.   The food was good, the coconut shrimp was amazing. But the lack of customer service made even the good food feel overpriced - and it wasn't even busy! There were only three other tables! Plus after the meal we all sat and talked for 30 minutes or so, with our dirty dishes in front of us the entire time. Our waitress brought the check, and picked it up - all while leaving our dirty plates in front of us and didn't offer us coffee or desserts.   If we go back it will be on a day when we are neither thirsty nor hungry when we first arrive - because by the time we get food/water we will undoubtedly be dying. It's really a pity because if the service were better we definitely would have already been back for some chowder and coconut shrimp!"}
{"text":"Time of visit: 06/24/2010, 7:30 p.m.  Key words: insects, not clean, below average food, high prices.  Cost of meal for two: about $97, including one tap beer and no other bar service.  Host service: Our time waiting to be seated was 9 minutes, 50 seconds. There was a clock by the host stand. There was one family ahead of us who was seated immediately. The host came through at least three times and said we would be seated right away. The host was congenial. The restaurant was not busy, and no one else was waiting. We asked for and received an indoor table.  Bar service: Drinks at the table.  Table service: Our waiter was young and inexperienced, but smiling and happy to please. He was attentive. However, he either did not inform the host/manager about the bug on our table, or they declined to follow through on it. We gave him a full 20%, as he was the best part of the restaurant.  Cleanliness: The table we were seated at was, in a word, nasty. It had been prepped with clean silverware/napkin rolls and bread plates. The surface of the table was sticky all over. The finish was deeply cracked as though it had been in a wreck (other tables were not) and the cracks were filled with grime. While we were waiting for our food, a hairy millipede walked right down the center of the table. My partner did it in with his napkin. We ended up covering the table with a fresh napkin. We gave the napkin with the bug to the waiter, who briefly apologized, but took no further action. There were flies in the dining room, and some dead flies on the window ledge near our table. The bathroom (men) was better than some, but the garbage was overflowing and had been for awhile. There was no soap. As I returned to our table, I let the host know about the condition of the bathroom and he dealt with it himself, immediately.  Atmosphere: 1970s seafood restaurant, with rough plank walls and giant, mounted fish. Seashells. The decor was a bit cliched, but other than that, was fine. The restaurant was not busy when we were there, but if it had been, there was really no place to sit and wait for a table. There is quite a bit of outside seating with a partial lake (Mendota) view.  Food:  Appetizer - Seafood Sampler. The highly touted coconut shrimp (which the menu proclaims several times was seen on the Food Network) was over-breaded and did not have a coconut flavor. The calamari was under-breaded and kind of soggy. The crab cake was fine, but really needed a hint of Old Bay or other seasoning to make the crab flavor pop. The wontons were actually quite good; the best part of the meal. However, all of the items were barely warm, as though they had been sitting around awhile.  Bread: Nice fresh and hot ciabatta rolls with dill in them, which came with a trio of flavored butters. The flavored butters were a good idea, but the dill in the bread overpowered them. Either dill in the bread or flavorings in the butter would be fine. Prequel: I had the \"famous\" clam chowder, which was served in a coffee mug. It was good soup. However, it was not good clam chowder. There was so much ham or bacon flavoring that there was no clam flavor. I'm not sure that there were clams in it, as the meaty part seemed to be krab (yes, krab, not crab) instead of clams. However, it was difficult to tell for sure. My partner had a salad, which looked good. Main course - Stuffed tilapia. The tilapia was way overcooked, dry and tough. The spinach stuffing was fine, but the promised crab did not seem to be present. If it was there, it was invisible and flavorless. The light cream sauce promised on the menu was not there at all. Instead, the fish had a healthy pouring of what looked and tasted like canned, plain tomato sauce. The broccoli was okay, but regrettably not the local, organic variety that is in such abundance in this area now. I had a side of grilled scallops which were cold (did not melt the butter I dabbed on them) and seemed like they might have been a tad undercooked. The baked potato was a baked potato, but was steamed and old, making the skin quite tough. My partner had the grilled scallops main course with a lobster tail. His scallops also were cold and not quite done. The lobster tail seemed fine. He had to ask for drawn butter, and when it arrived it was a dead-clear amber liquid that made me wonder if it was not butter, but butter-flavored grill oil. Dessert: None.  General remarks: For all of the years I have lived in the Madison area, I have heard good things about Bill's as a nice place to take a date. My impression is that during the days when Madison was seriously short on seafood restaurants, these guys put out an impressive plate. Now those days are over, and they seem to be riding on history and reputation. With so many nicer places popping up around town, though, I'm not sure how long they will be able to maintain their momentum without a serious makeover."}
{"text":"Not much to tell.  The atmosphere was nice, but the menu was overpriced and the service was less than stellar.  We were all in a great mood, as it was a large group and we came here after a special event, so had fun anyway, but it had the potential to be oh so much better"}
{"text":"Waited for over a half an hour for service, tried to get attention of staff but was ignored. Not a very good dining experience. For such high prices and all the other restaurant venues in Madison/Middleton the services should really be better. However, since this is a local place that probably has consistent local repeat business, I am guessing these reviews don't mean much. We ended up just walking out and informed the wait staff. Of course they just shrugged and didn't care much. I am guessing this place will eventually have to change its management style if it wants to stay open in such a competitive market. We ended up going to Olivia's off of Old Sauk and actually had amazing service. Quite the 180."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and I really enjoy the clam chowder. If you don't get a cup or a bowl you're missing out!!! To be fair, I've only had the fish fry here but each time I eat here I'm more and more impressed. Eventually I'll get my lazy behind here on a non fish fry day as the menu looks delicious."}
{"text":"Where better to take advantage of restaurant week than through Madison's expensive joints? Truthfully, I went into Captain Bill's with lowered expectations - thanks, Yelpers! To my surprise, my three-course meal wasn't half bad if still overpriced.  I should note that while it doesn't compare to Merchant, Captain Bill's has a solid selection of cocktails. My Salty Dog was fairly lackluster, but as my annoyed girlfriend can attest, their tropical drinks are embarrassingly tasty.  I started with their famed clam chowder as an appetizer, and it did not disappoint. Served in a warm mug, the chowder was rich, creamy and spectacularly spiced (something other restaurants often neglect in their chowder) with sizable chunks of clam meat. Croutons on top added a welcome crunchy garnish.  The surf and turf was substantial but relatively unspectacular. The cut of tenderloin was cooked to order (medium rare) and seasoned to the point of not needing any steak sauce to add cheap flavor. The lobster was middling.  The desert, a chocolate trifle, was about as airy and dull as the supposedly \"rich\" cake the Godiva blueberries and bavarian cream came paired with. I stole a few bites of Key Lime pie and can confirm from multiple sources that I \"missed out.\"  I would rate Captain Bill's a star above the three were it not so expensive. Pricey seafood is one thing, but to jack up each of their menu items at the quality and portions provided is a touch ridiculous. Or maybe I'm just cranky about not getting more of their fantastic ciabatta. Good, not great."}
{"text":"Chef Adam and Robert Von Rutenberg are awesome. They have turned the restaurant into an amazing experience- everything from the indoor seated round table fire pit, to the outdoor dining, to the excellent food- it's a fun place to go. The clam chowder is the best in the area, the crab cakes are sumptuous, the Friday Fish Fry always contains nice surprise options that they fly in fresh, and the service really is wonderful. Disregard previous reviews from years ago- the entire staff has been replaced, the Chef is new, as is the management. Robert, like his beloved mother Betty, will go out of his way to insure that your dining experience is phenomenal. They are a locally owned business, and I look forward to dining there with my significant other. We love the place! In regards to \"recent\" bad reviews.....I'm stumped. I've never had a bad experience.  ??"}
{"text":"Where to start...the food overall was fairly good; however the service definitely left something to be desired.   Our waiter Jeremiah was the most inattentive waiter we have ever had! The first time my grandparents each ordered a glass of wine he mixed up their wines.  He never cleared any of our used beverage glasses even though we had lined them all up at the end of the table so he could easily get to them.  At one point we ordered a glass of wine and 20 minutes later we still never had received it, so I took up our four glasses up to the bar and brought back the  glass of wine that was sitting at the bar ready to go back to our table.  Our food took forever to get, yet everyone else around us seemed be getting served... not sure if our waiter forgot to put in our food order???  We ordered the coconut shrimp as an appetizer which were very good but extremely over priced, $15 for 4!  Our waiter said they were jumbo, I would call them large but definitely not jumbo.   We also all ordered the clam chowder and that was pretty amazingly creamy and delicious.  A different waiter seemed to be bringing out the food to the tables and at first he tried to give us someone else's meal!!  Once we finally received our food my grandfather found 2 long blond hairs in his salmon, yuck!  That was the straw that broke the camels back.  The manager was very nice and comped a round of drinks for all the problems we had; however, in the future we would just take out a quart of soup to go and skip the whole dinning experience."}
{"text":"Out to dinner for my fathers b- day with my mother and daughter. The food was good. We day outside and eat it was a nice night for that."}
{"text":"Rip off. We took about 20 people there for happy hour. Drinks were suppose to be half off. We were told they couldn't do it because their computers were broken. Apparently, the manager is unable to do higher math?  We will never go back for happy hour and they have lost my business dinners. Hope it was worth it."}
{"text":"We made a reservation only to be seated and have no server apprach our table. Being a previous server myself I have to say the service is lousy and the food is mediocre. What baffels me is the tables around us had servers and not once did a server ask us if we had been waited on. This shows lack of management and team work. The server who came to iur table was taking order and her cell phone was ringing. This place is a joke and living in Florida the seafood is not fresh here. Over priced and smells musty and moldy. Advise. Go to the Tempest for excellent service and seafood"}
{"text":"Definitely will not be dining here again.  Server was annoying and unprofessional.  Food was sub-subpar.  This place has really changed for the worse in the past five years."}
{"text":"We're not from Madison but my parents just moved there recently and my dad was hellbent on trying Captain Bill's. So we went. It's fine for what it is- an old school, nautical type restaurant that is more pricey than it needs to be. We sat outside, on plastic chairs, and fought off mosquitoes as we watched the sun set over the lake. My dad ordered some crazy martini and the rest of us ordered our drinks. Well, the server comes back with our drinks some 10 minutes later and tells my dad that they are \"out of\" certain ingredients with which to make that cocktail. I mean, why would you wait until the rest of us have our drinks? We got them piecemeal, too. Anyway, he got something else and our server did not rush back with it, either. That said, the server was trying really hard to be charismatic. This is not a fine dining establishment. I had haddock, which tasted frozen. Not great. The baked potato was about as good as I make at home. The salad came with shrimp, which I liked. The wine list is actually decent, which was a plus. We didn't stick around for dessert. Would I come here again? If I had to. But I wouldn't go out of my way. There's nothing to say where the seafood comes from or if it's wild or farmed, sustainable or not...It's just a very basic, old restaurant with ok food and spotty service. I had to point out that the server left the drink they were out of on the bill. Frankly, it was Father's Day, he should have comped my dad the other drink he had to order, but he didn't. Whatever."}
{"text":"The clam chowder was very good as were the lobster bites as an apetizer.  The rest of the meal was...OK.  I think I could do as well at home.  Some things were over-cooked and over-salted.  I make a better coconut shrimp at home and my friend's scallops weren't done.  I really, really wanted to like the place because I love sea food and I want to support locally owned businesses...but this place has got to do better to compete.  It needs to have someone supervising the kitchen who knows food.  It was pretty clear the \"chef\" didn't care too much about what they were putting out."}
{"text":"We made reservations at Captain Bill's, and after being  seated, no one took our drink order or acknowledged us.  After 20 minutes we left.  There were lots of servers.... they just ask seemed to be so singularly focused on individual tasks rather than making sure everyone was helped.  As we walked out and passed 3 servers standing by a door, no one said anything. We will not go back."}
{"text":"We went to Captain Bill's for Easter brunch. Brunch was so-so. Unfortunately I got food poisoning. Think it was the shrimp. Not going back!"}
{"text":"Great food & service - out server Allie was a delight- great evening --- amazing oysters & crab cakes best cheese curds!"}
{"text":"We are from out-of-town and we stayed in Madison for two days.  Captain Bill's was good, but pricey.  The view was great!   Best clam chowder ever, hands down!  Amazing chocolate moose type pie.   We'll return in the future!"}
{"text":"First repeat date night restaurant for the husband and I.  Had a coupon, which is why we went.  Had great views of the lake, which was nice.  Service started off slow and I began to think it was not going to be a good night.  Waiter finally brought us waters and took our drink order (got a Whiskey Old Fashioned and Moscow Mule throughout the night.  Nothing special, but they made them well enough).  When he brought our drinks, he dropped them off without taking our food order and did not come back for nearly 10 minutes.  Finally, we were able to order though. Started with the crab cakes--tasty but seems really pricey ($12) for the size of the cakes.  For the entrees, I got the beer battered tilapia tacos and husband got the dragonfire salmon.  The ciabatta bread for the table came with 3 seasonal butter flavors--merlot and shallot, basil honey, and citrus.  Hands down, favorite was the basil honey.  Sweet and savory.  The tacos were okay; the guacamole that came on the side and the chipotle mayo was the saving grace, adding flavor to an otherwise pretty bland taco.  The only other toppings was plain lettuce and tomatoes, no spices, no slaw.  The dragonfire salmon was good, had a nice kick to it and the garlic mashed potatoes and beans on the side were fantastic. Dessert menu is a little blah--seems like they are desserts that come to the restaurant pre-made and frozen and they just defrost and serve. Madison needs more water-front restaurants so this isn't one of my only options."}
{"text":"Awsome restaurant right by the lake. We had the shark bites as an app. It was amazingly good. Pretty reasonably prices too. Our party orders Salmon and King Crab, both of which were amazing. Drinks were tasty and a little pricey, but overall a great experience. We loves Middleton in part because of restaurants like this one."}
{"text":"We made reservations for Valentine's night. When we got there they were running 45 minutes behind. When we went to the bar, it took over 30 minutes to get drinks. When we were finally seated and received our food it was cold. It was a complete waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Best way to sum it up is BLAH....  Nothing exciting here.  We went twice because we like their other restaurants but were not impressed with the bland and boring menu selections"}
{"text":"Here's hoping they put some of that restaurant week money towards renovating the men's room. Not only does it look like it walked out of a real boat house from the 1930s, it also features a stall door that swings freely from the ceiling due to the metal being completely rusted through, making it impossible to securely shut or lock. UPDATE: I've been told the door has been fixed. Will remove this review after I go again and verify. But figured I'd let you know it's probably better now."}
{"text":"We were a large group of 12 and we were kind of underwhelmed with all of it.    Service was okay, slow.  Outside doesn't have a great view of the water, in my opinion. Food was not great. Should know better than to order real seafood so far away from the sea, normally we know better.  Started with salads and Calamari -- caesar salads were overdressed, calamari was a small order and a little undercooked. I ordered blackened tilapia that was good, kind of a small order of rice with it. Vegetables were a little sloppy and overcooked.  My husband ordered the 2 lobster tails to share with our teenage daughter.  They were the tiniest tails we had ever seen, especially for $44.  I have to say there was like 2 tablespoons of lobster at the top of each. When we mentioned it to the waitress she did say right away she would get one more sent out, which came almost immediately. We appreciated how she handled that.  The only other thing that made us miffed was my 11 year old niece ordered crab legs -- she was not sitting near her parents so no one heard her ordering them, nor notice they were priced at \"market price\", which turned out to be $50 when the bill came.  My brother mentioned to both the waitress and a manager that in the future when a child orders something like that they should look to the parents to make sure they are aware.  Their defense was they wouldn't second guess what someone is ordering, but I reminded my brother that it happens all the time -- if the kids want soda they look to us to make sure it's okay, or if a kid's meal comes with dessert they ask us first if it's okay to mention it.  If they do that they should certainly make sure someone is aware a small child is ordering a $50 meal!  We would have felt better about it if they had acknowledged the issue and if it seemed they would use it as a learning opportunity, but we didn't feel that way."}
{"text":"I was home visiting my parents in Madison and we went here.  First off the seafood isn't fresh, because like it is Wisconsin, and so you aint going to get fresh seafood.  I did enjoy their \"world famous chowda\" because who doesn't enjoy eating creamy soup!    The prices, for Madison, are ridiculous.  The service though was great and the food was ok.  The ambiance is nice and of course the people who work here are so accommodating.  But $30.00 for shrimp?  I mean really.  You could get shrimp right of the boat in Maine for $20.00...just sayin."}
{"text":"We've been wanting to try Captain Bill's ever since we heard of it. A restaurant with a lake view, how can you beat that?  We made reservations for four on Friday night. When we arrived, the hostess seated us immediately and gave us menus. The decor includes lots of wood with various whimsical nautical touches. It's fairly dark inside which is probably meant to be romantic, but just makes reading the menus sightly more challenging.  The menu included a variety of seafood appetizers and entrees including oysters on the half shell, which always makes me happy. There is steak and Mac & Cheese if someone doesn't like seafood. The drink menu had many cocktails, martinis, beers and ice-cream drinks, so there was something for everyone.  At this point we knew what we wanted and were just waiting for a waiter/waitress to arrive. We waited and we waited. Finally, one of us went up to the hostess stand and mentioned we still hadn't seen a server. A couple of minutes later our waitress arrived. She was fun and polite and from that point on, an excellent server. Perhaps there was just a miscommunication early on and they didn't know whose table we were?  We ordered drinks, appetizers, and entrees. I had a Bloody Mary which had pickle, celery, onion, mushroom, and olive. The spice level was great. Ten of our twelve oysters were excellent. Our last two had bits of shell but the flavor was great. My entree was the bluegill fish-fry. I was pleased with both the portion-size and the preparation of the bluegill as well as my side of wild rice pilaf. Everyone at our table enjoyed their food and particularly the fried cheese curds.  Our waitress continued to be funny, courteous, and prompt throughout our meal. Except for that initial wait where I think there must have been miscommunication on who was waiting on us, it was a very enjoyable meal. I would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding birthday dinner! Surfing Salmon delicious! Coconut shrimp and calamari were spectacular and Bobbie Von Rutenberg was a gracious host! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The Wife and I went to Captain Bill's with friends in late August. We had heard that the food would not impress us, but that the view of the lake would be worth trying the place. WRONG.  Let me start with the view. The little bit of the lake that we could see was, well, pretty lame. It definitely was not an impressive view, so that reason for going was no longer valid.  The food. Oh, the food. It was, quite literally, the worst food that The Wife and I have had in years. I ordered the shrimp scampi (since it's a seafood restaurant), only to be told that the pasta would count as one of my sides. WHAT? Shrimp scampi ALWAYS comes on pasta, but Captain Bill's nickle and dimed me on the pasta? Lame. Oh, and the pasta was so completely undercooked that I ended up only having 2 small bites before pushing it away in disgust. I mean, it wasn't even close to being cooked as much as \"al dente.\"  The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either.  We will never go back to Captain Bills, and I do not recommend that you do, either."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to Captain Bills's several times with consistently pretty darn good food and service, but tonight, they dropped the ball.     We were seated fairly quickly but waited quite awhile before our server came to the table. We ordered the haddock fish fry with a side of their clam chowder.  The chowder was, as always, delicious and was served fairly promptly.   Our dinner was also served in a reasonable amount of time, but then our server disappeared.  We wanted a box for leftovers and a refill on our water, and we waited.... And waited...... I'd guess fifteen minutes passed after we began looking for our server when she finally appeared asking if we were ready for dessert.    My other complaint is with the fish itself.  I've had plenty of fish fry's in the past but never before have I needed a knife to literally saw at my fish!   It tasted alright--just alright--but it was ridiculously tough.   I'm afraid Captain Bill's may be living on past glory and isn't putting much effort into their food (except the chowder) or the service anymore.  There are much better choices on Friday night."}
{"text":"I agree with the review about being \"under-whelmed.\"  We ordered the lobster bites, as an appetizer which were good.  For dinner one of us had the seared scallops in champagne sauce, the other had the coconut shirmp.  The seared scallops were barely seared, I do a better job at home.  It was pretty clear they were made in a hurry (not a hot enough pan) and reduction sauce was not reduced AT ALL.  It was a runny mess.  Both came with sides of green beans - we were trying to figure out if they were over-cooked crisp-tender or undercooked fully cooked beans!!  I love green beans, again, I could cook them better.  The coconut shrimp was OK, but not like I've had the in past.  In the past they dipped the shrimp and then rolled them in coconut, so it was crunchy coconut on the outside.  This time it looks like the coconut was in the batter.  ICK.  Needless to say, there wasn't much identifiable coconut, but a lot of batter.  The dipping sauce was very good though.  Overall, meh.  I think they're going on their past reputation.  I found the food out of date and rather icky.  My dining partners mashed potatoes were really lumpy too.  Meh.  There is better to be had for the money.  Also we could see the food pick up area from where we were sitting....ripped up paneling and what liked a dirty area.  Not impressive.  Basically, it's clear that no one is paying attention to the small details here. NO one.  Details can make or break a place.  I give this place about 4 more years and they'll be gone unless they seriously clean up and update their cooks."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time was not a terrible experience they do have an amazing soup. The second time that I went we were seated outside for 20 minutes nobody even asked us if we wanted drinks. We finally had to ask to be seated inside due to the bugs. I went to the bar to get my own drinks. The waitstaff weren't very nice or engaging. Besides the soup my main dish was disappointing as well."}
{"text":"Very good and that is an understatement. J and I went on a Sunday at 5pm right when they opened. We made reservations via open table and were seated in the lounge near the fireplace. By the time we ordered our first round of drinks, Korbel Old fashion and Sauvignon Blanc, 2 larger groups plus 3 other tables were seated near us. I suggest making a reservation. We had 18 oysters on the half shell which were served with grated horsradish, lemon wedges, and cocktail sauce along with a bowl of crackers and tabasco. It's a Wisconsin thing.... the crackers that is. We are oyster fanatics. We eat them whenever available. We were beyond satisfied with the freshness from the oysters. Then we had two lump crab cakes (oysers were better) but crab cakes were delicious. J thought they were phenominal but if I had to pick I'd choose the oysters because I can make a meal out of a boat load of shucked oysters. Ok on to dinner. J had 1# king crab and a filet. I had Ribeye special with blueberry merlot compote plus I added on the coconut shrimp. Why did I add on the coconut shrimp??? Hello if you aren't from Wisconsin then I should inform you that the coconut shrimp have been featured on the Food Network. They are like ketchup, or napkins, or a cream in your coffee. Trust me, the coconut shrimp are a necessity and should be added without an exeception. Speaking of staple menu items that have been featured on the Food Network, Captain Bill's famous clam chowder is offered with entrees unless you'd like a salad. We don't even want to think about salads as a comparision to the clam chowder. It is heavenly and it has a slight hint of something something (nutmeg??? sherry??? Old Bay???) that you can't figure out but makes you crave it even after you are full. Our entrees were great both of our steaks were cooked to perfection (med rares) J said the crab legs were some of the best he has had up here in the midwest. He recently just had crab legs on a business trip in Florida so that speaks volumes. My only slight complaint was that my steak was slightrly under seasoned. I had to add salt. Lately I think I am desensitized to salt so maybe that might be why. The blueberry compote on my charred ribeye was an added touch of flavor explosion on my taste buds so the light handed salt from the kitchen was no biggie. Another added bonus was we were given two chocolate covered strawberries. Enough said. RUN don't walk to CB's. Live salt water aquarium behind bar too. Open kitchen in dining room as well. View of Lake Mendota is visible from nearly the entire restaurant"}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary dinner and were treated to another wonderful meal and exceptional service. The coconut  shrimp and the mahi mahi were delish and the Clam Chowder was sublime! The restaurant was jam-packed on this Friday night, but we were seated immediately by our host, Robert. One of Madisons BEST restaurants."}
{"text":"We went for our 22nd anniversary expecting a great seafood meal.....boy we were wrong!  It was a Sat night and were not busy, we ordered our drinks which took 15 min to get.  The manager finally brought them out and our sever noticed that my drink glass had a crack down it. We ordered an appetizer of crab cakes.  Needless to say we got our salad and soup before our crab cakes.  We placed our order of king crab legs and scallops.  The next 45 minutes we waited for our food when our server noted the fact and she also was wondering what the hold up was.  After an hour waiting we finally got our food.  The French fries were barely warm, the rice pilaf and scallops were freezing cold!  My husband found a manager and he told us he would get fresh hot fries and new food.  Well it was warmed up in the microwave and the scallops became rubbery and the manager never once checked back.  We explained to our sever and she was totally embarrassed.  She took the matter in her own hands and removed our appetizer and scallop dinner off our bill.  It was very disappointing in a place that we held in high regards for a great place with great food.  We aren't sure we will be going back.......ever."}
{"text":"Moved to Madison 2 months ago and we've been here 3 times. Not because of the food, mostly for the lake view. Never again. On our last visit, I had to send my trout back. It was bad. Not bad like I didn't like it, bad like I'm going to be in the hospital if I eat this.  The waitress proceded to tell me I didn't know what \"truly fresh trout tastes like\"!!!!! This place is a waste of lake front property.  Why doesn't Madison have any good restaurants on the water?"}
{"text":"Coconut shrimp Salad with balsamic  Grilled scallops Tropical mahi mahi Key lime pie  Chocolate mousse with macadamia nuts Two mojitos $84"}
{"text":"My son and I just wanted an enjoyable dinner with a view of the lake so we thought of Captain Bill's. The view was great but the food was nearly inedible. My walleye was a nice size but so over-cooked and tasteless. The crab cakes tasted awful. Our baked potatoes had been sitting in the microwave for far to long. The vegetables were a nice mixture but as bland as can be. This dinner, which we did not finish, cost $60 with the tip. No drinks, no dessert. What a waste of money. This restaurant used to at least be tolerable; it doesn't even reach that anymore."}
{"text":"I don't know if the other reviews are planted by the restaurant itself, or if the quality has just gone way downhill, or people have no idea what they are writing about or what the heck, but this place was a huge disappointment. I started to get a bad feeling when I saw the decor, that kind of retro \"parts of ships\" look that seems un-real, like they got it all from \"Discount Nautical Restaurant Makeover Depot.\" The service was lackluster in every way - we had a long-ish wait for everything in a not very crowded restaurant, the servers were not well versed on the menu items, we got the wrong side dishes, water in a plastic cup after I specifically requested a normal glass, worse was that when we flagged them down to explain that things were wrong they didn't seem particularly interested in correcting anything. The food was so incredibly uninteresting. I got the chef's special, which was a very bland, spongy tilapia with overcooked bland vegetables. The quality of the fish was like something from the frozen section of a supermarket, complete with a flavorless sprinkling of what tasted like a \"spice packet\", really miserable. I have no idea what kind of flavor profile they were going for; salty, very boring. We tried the coconut shrimp that are supposedly a signature dish, \"as featured on the Food Network\" which frankly lowered my estimation of the Food Network - do they take kick-backs? Is that product placement? Something's wrong. Anyone can slap some coconut and macadamia nuts on jumbo shrimp and deep fry them, what makes a dish like that great is sourcing high quality shrimp, and whipping up interesting and freshly made sauces, not something that tastes like it came from a white bucket off an Aramark truck. Even the blackened salmon (obviously farmed, and thawed from having been frozen) was bland. So very, very bland. How you can make blackened food bland is beyond me. All the starches were overly salted and pasty too, the wild rice was all split from being over-boiled which is not a nice thing to do to wild rice. The plating was similarly boring. If you're going to do seafood, do fresh seafood, people can defrost things at home. Really fresh great quality seafood doesn't need much tarting up, just handle it carefully, and keep the accompaniments fresh too, and you're set, but that's assuming you care to serve something truly nice. I've never eaten at a casino, or Rainforest Cafe, but I'm guessing the food is like this; pseudo-fancy, impressive to people who don't eat out much, or just eat at chains, or kids. (I have been to Red Lobster, this place is sub-Red Lobster) Nothing seemed to be fresh or from scratch, or interesting, or inspired at all, it was all lifeless by-the-numbers lowest-common-denominator food like something you'd get at an airport. Key Lime Pie when Key Limes are not in season, that kind of thing. On the plus side the prices were not extravagant, and none of us got food poisoning. On the minus side, everything else: rampant mediocrity - with a slightly snooty air about the place too, as if it's anything remotely akin to fine dining. Ha! More like a fine dining themed restaurant - should have a big fiber-glass sailor outside so you know what you're getting into. I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark and guess that there is a certain niche market for people who are both pretentious and cheap, who like to engage in \"we're so fancy\" make-believe, and this place caters to them specifically, I completely believe Jon S.when he writes the manager told him 'if he didn't like it not to bother coming back' - if your taste buds work and your not into 'banker cosplay' you're not their target market, they really don't want you sitting in the dining room pointing out the inadequacies of nearly everything about the joint.  Long story short, the food here is delicious in the same way the people on 'real housewives' reality shows are desirable."}
{"text":"Some of the best seafood that we've had in town. There seems to be places in town that get better reviews, but I'm not sure why.  If I want crab or lobster this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good. Get the clam chowder and make sure you keep your waitress busy bringing you bread to use as a vehicle for their flavored whipped butters. Thursday night is all night happy hour, which makes this upscale joint the same price as your average non-dive bar."}
{"text":"This was my first time!  I don't think I realized this restaurant was here.  I enjoyed my visit and thought the food was tasty.  Had an especially good grasshopper(after dinner drink)  out on deck overlooking the water.  Ill be back when I have a seafood craving!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food was very good.  Only problem was the steaks were no where near the size printed in the menu.  Outdoor seating option is a plus by the lake."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try this place because they are owned by the same people as mariners Inn and we had a bad experience there a couple of weeks ago,  however we were pleasantly surprised. The waitress was nice and attentive. The food was really good. We ordered the brushetta and it was different than any other kind I've had,  very good. The clam chowder came in a cute cup and tasted good. I ordered the dragon salmon the chili pineapple topping was a little overpowering for the salmon but it had a really good flavor and the salmon was moist. My fiancé ordered the scallops and said they were cooked perfectly. The prices were a little high but not to bad. We would probably come back again."}
{"text":"I really like this place. My mom and I had a wonderful dinner. It was really nice to sit by the window. Our service was great. I had the pet tenderloin with a lobster tail and my mom had the blackened tilapia. Both were very delicious. Also try the high seas punch is awesome!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was charming with a nautical theme as expected. We sat by the fireplace overlooking the lake. Cocktails were very good and so were the soup and spinach salad with strawberries and blue cheese. The champaign scallops were delicious and cooked perfectly with good portion size. My husband got the lobster Mac and cheese and it was extremely disappointing-No flavor, no cheese  and did not come with anything. Not very satisfying. Service was very good."}
{"text":"This is one of the best sea food restaurants in the entire United States.  The food is great and so is the service. On my last visit, I had the coconut shrimp, loaded baked potato, salad and lobster tail and it was all off the charts!  The salad was fresh and had a couple of jumbo shirmp in it.  They also had tasty warm bread with a choice of 4 home made spreads to put on it.   If I could give this place 100 stars I would.  I have been going here for many years and this placed has remained consistent and solid in its excellence.   This place is very lovely and sits on the lake which gives you a great view.  In the winter there is a really cool fire place with a table around it. (Did I just say \"cool fire\"?  LOL).  My only regret is that in recent visits I noticed that they no longer have their delicious Oysters Rockefeller on the menu."}
{"text":"I was here years ago with my husband and his friend.  At that time, the place had no acoustics.  A large party arrived during our meal and the noise level was deafening.  I had been here once before and mentioned experiencing the din to the manager before he seated us, who assured us the decibel level was no longer a problem.  He lied,  Food was fine, prices average, but I haven't been back."}
{"text":"Always a fun evening at Captain Bill's - Middleton - at the corner of Q & M. Sonya was our server and she took great care of us.  She enjoyed the Pan Seared Jumbo Scallops with a house salad and I dined on the Captain's Shrimp - with a salad and a cup of the famous Captain Bill's clam chowder - the best ever.  Dinner was capped off with one of Kris's favorite ice cream concoctions - it was delicious.  Thanks Captain Bill's for a delicious and fun evening"}
{"text":"Patio with a lake view is nice in the summer.  The food and service are consistently flat.  Clam chowder is generally the best part of the meal.  It's pretty light on clams considering its name, but there's a nice smoky quality to cream of potato base that I really like.  Crab cakes don't taste fresh...not fishy or offensive in any way, just not fresh.  Yesterday, i tried the stuffed tilipia, it was just meh.  That's kinda the thing with Captain Bill's.  It's not so terrible that you would actively avoid it, but not good enough that you'd ever go out of your way to eat there. One side note, our server (Asia) was a notch above what I'd come to expect from this place.  She was attentive and still seemed to care.  That's not always the case here."}
{"text":"Sigh. Went here to use Gift Certificate Number Two the other night. So mediocre. We were seated at the SAME table, and had the SAME waiter(which was kind of weird...)  I ordered the Cajun Walleye, and was totally bummed. Either I didn't read the menu well, or it didn't actually say \"over-cooked flavorless fillet drizzled with thousand-island like goo\".  For whichever reason, I was so disappointed. Chris had the Capitol Fish Fry again, which was good. His mom had the ribs, which she said were tasty...but she might have just been polite. Who knows.   The bread was still yummy, and I had a side salad instead of chowder, which was fresh, and garnished with a jumbo shrimp. Nice touch.  I guess I'll just be going here for the \"Fish Fry\"  that Chris has had from now on..."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get pretty good seafood in a Mid-Western town.  I'd say it's similar to Red Lobster, but better in nearly every way.  They recently changed their menu, but I know the previous menu provided lots of food for a reasonable price.  Really great clam chowder."}
{"text":"The clam chowder is fairly good, but I would describe it as a cream of bacon and potato with a couple clams thrown in as an afterthought.   I got the coconut shrimp and shared a crabcake. Both were good, crabcakes could be spicier.  The bloody mary was WAY too salty, think twice about that one.  Staff is great.  But I ended up paying 45+ dollars. It's good but it ain't THAT good. I think they can get away with it because of loyal clientele and some attention from the food network."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Food was okay but no crab legs? Really? Way too expensive.  Prices us out. Not worth it.   Love the View and location. I'd love it if they served crab legs and the prices were a bit more reasonable.  If they would do that ...we would be going there all the time. As for now, we go once about every 4 years."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant under different ownership for many years.  I love the deck for happy hour in the summer, ordering appetizers and drinks at excellent prices.  And oysters for my husband.  I have usually been part of a group and feel the wait staff do a good job."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it was decent but typically not worth the price. This time I went w a group from work. We got there close to open time and it was quiet. We ordered appetizers and drinks and sat close to the window, great view. Our waitress tried hard to wrangle our crowd and was very polite. A little flighty, but sweet. They happened to have a magician that night, he was a really great addition to the otherwise quiet bar area.   Steamed shrimp was pretty good and the caprese mushroom caps weren't bad. I heard the crab cakes were rich and filling but I didn't get to try them.   Go during happy hour, great prices!!"}
{"text":"My score is actually somewhere between 3-4 stars.  I was scared to go here after reading the reviews but our group really enjoyed this place.  We were in town for a special occasion--graduation.  We sat outside on a beautiful day. Great view!   The waiter was outstanding.  He told us upfront they were short staffed in the kitchen.  I was like---here come the service issues.  However, things went very smoothly and he bent over backwards to make my niece feel special on her special day.   Everyone loved oysters Rockefeller and lobster bites.   2 people ordered filet and it was very tasty and tender.  2 other people ordered king crab legs.  They are pricey $49.50.  They were a tad cold inside but, other than that, very good.  I had salmon on the plank.  It was disappointing as it didn't have much flavor on the sauce.  On the plus side, salmon can be fishy and the filet was very fresh.  I think it could have been cooked longer on the plank to infuse the smoky flavor.  Inside seating is not as good.  It's a bit stuffy so we were glad to be outside.  The place means well.  With a little TLC, this could be a great venue.  Give it a try and sit outside!"}
{"text":"''This is a tale of extremely poor service and average food. A warning to all, go for the view and clam chowder. I should have read the reviews before making reservations.  Sunday night 6:45pm reservations on the patio.When we arrived our table wasn't ready. Not sure why as they weren't busy. After long wait while another couple without reservations -- who had arrived after us -- was seated, we were escorted to our table.  A great view looking over the water. Menus were dropped on the table when we were seated. It was more than 10 minutes before a server came for our drink order and 15 more minutes before we received our beverages. Smartly we ordered dinner at the same time we did the drinks.   With the drinks we received a small basket of bread with compound butter. Very good. A long while later two cups of soup were hurriedly set on our table with out a word from our server. She ran off so fast I didn't have time to ask for salt and pepper.   We had ordered crab cakes as an appetizer and wondered why the soup came out first. The soup was flavorful but barely hot. Lots of clams and heavy cream. Yum!  It took awhile for the crab cakes to arrive. How long you ask? The people seated next to us, after we we seated, already had their entrees. The crab cakes were not worth the wait. They were generously sized and the two cakes could easily serve 4. There wasn't any crab taste and no large chunks of crab.  Our entrees were not brought out by our server.  Note: up to this point we've seen our waitress twice with one interaction to take our order. No solicitation for a second drink order, or check in, or even bussing the table to remove extra dishes.  When the entrees were served by the bus boy we asked him for another drink. A few seconds later our waitress finally showed up to check in. Great timing.   The bass special with peach salsa was good and came with green beans and garlic mashed potatoes. The coconut shrimp were very large, crispy and not greasy. Very good. The rice pilaf was very flavorful but lukewarm instead of hot.  We will return to sit on the patio for a drink and chowder as Madison has few restaurants on the water. That is, if the lack of good service doesn't close them down."}
{"text":"The food was not the best the fish was really fishey tasting. The cheese churds were soggy the ranch was really watery down."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun, especially if you have kids, but the food is only ok. They also do have a great view of the lake."}
{"text":"Terrible.  Do not waste your time.  The entire \"family\" of restaurants (Naughty Gal, Cap Bills, Mariner's Inn) are all overrated, in fact poor.  If you think their \"award winning\" clam chowder is even palatable, you have never had good clam chowder."}
{"text":"This is THE place in Madison for a Thursday happy hour! $10 off large apps?! The coconut shrimp is amazing. $5 off rails? Complete your meal with an old fashioned for $3 and you'll leave satisfied with a full wallet"}
{"text":"This place used to be great. We went for dinner and were seriously disappointed. First the bartender was nervous and seemed very green. Second the server didn't even recognize the fact that we needed water and drinks when she asked if we needed anything else after she brought us our food. Third the food was very sub par for the price. I ordered bacon wrapped shrimp and the bacon was white and under cooked. Cooking 101 teaches you how to bacon wrap things and obviously these cooks haven't took the class. When I complained about my rawish bacon the server offered me a free dessert. Come on people, lame. We also had several disappointed people around around us. I think the restaurant has changed hands and is not even close to what it used to be. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Captain Bill's has a few things going for it: a nice outside deck with great seating for summer weather, friendly staff, and good clam chowder.  On a recent visit, they were able to seat our group of 8 outside with just a few minutes notice.  Food got mixed reviews: my scallops were ever so slightly overcooked and the citrus sauce was lacking flavor of any kind.  The coconut shrimp got good reviews, as did the steak carnitas.  One dish came out wrong, but was quickly fixed, and our attempt to split the bill were somewhat unsuccessful.  There are better places in Madison, but if you find yourself at Captain Bill's, get a seat outside and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"I'd like to give this long-standing, neighborhood restaurant a better review but it just isn't there.   Service: Tonight's service was slow and at times inaccurate. Having said that, it should be noted that there was only one waitress working the entire dining room and she had some help from a woman that I believe was the hostess. I can only assume someone called in unexpectedly tonight and this would not be their standard staffing practice on a Saturday night. Despite this predicament she was friendly and genuinely appeared cool, I have to give her credit for that.   Food: there has been a menu change since the last time we've visited, which I believe was within the last 6 or so months. There were a wider variety of appetizer options or shareable plates. We ordered the always delicious clam chowder and the peel and eat shrimp to start. Both would be repeaters. Our entrees were less impressive, the shrimp scampi and the macaroni and cheese with a NY strip. Both entrees were big enough to easily serve a family of four, easily. They were HUGE. The scampi was oddly bland but had a lot of shrimp. They used two different size shrimp in the pasta. Neither were fishy and were good quality even if puzzling to be in the same dish together. The macaroni entree was a pile of melty, cheesy, glutenous mush. The steak was tough and chewy according to my husband (I did not try that part of his meal). Now, sometimes luck has it that you get a bad piece of meat, so I'd hate to judge their steaks on this one steak. We ordered an ice cream drink, however a martini was delivered. Since we'd had this particular drink in the past we knew it was wrong. I pointed this out to our waitress. She attempted to convince me it was supposed to be a martini until I read the description to her directly from the drink menu. She apologized and returned it to the bar. We overheard the bartender telling her two patrons seated at the bar that she'd never made that drink before so we just cancelled the order deciding not to take a chance.   In summary, I'll return to sit outside and look at the pretty view of the lake, sip beer or cocktails and order a few of the new appetizers. It'll be a good time!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this place. They have this raging circular fireplace adjacent to the bar.  How cozy!  I also love all things nautical, which this place has no shortage of. You can make a reservation, which is particularly nice during busy Fridays during Lent.  Much of the food is heavier than I'm used to eating.  For example, I usually avoid fried food, and they have plenty of it.  Their World Famous Clam Chowder is definitely worth a try.  Again, packed with fat, but you know what you're walking into with this style of soup. I also enjoyed their asiago spinach garlic dip. I couldn't stop eating it.  The Kids menu was a let down. Their Mac n Cheese appeared to be Kraft, but lacked the flavor that mine has when I make it at home.  It tasted like it waited around in a pot and dried out.  Everyone knows you have to eat that stuff right away and it's no good heated up, so paying $6 for that is a mistake I don't want to repeat. I ordered a house salad.  It was too cold, too dry, and too flat. Other than the one tiny piece of shrimp they put on top of it, it had no character.  I sent it back.  The staff has always been polite and professional. It's a 2 stars for food and a 4 stars for ambiance; hence the 3 A-OK rating."}
{"text":"Nice views of the lake. Smaller plates a deal. Wines pricey. Great service. Food god but uninspired if nota bland. Great location. Helpful staff."}
{"text":"Had several dinners there.  Always greeted by some little guy that makes a big deal about finding us a table when the place is half empty.  Then when I ask to be served outside he likes to point out that it might rain.  I guess he does that so if it does rain they don't have to apologize for not finding us room inside, but what a turn off.     I go for mostly for the view of the lake."}
