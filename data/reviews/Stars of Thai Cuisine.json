{"text":"Very very bad. Long time for food to come in, worst taste of Thai food I have ever had. How can one screw up pad Thai ? But they were able to do that. Also randomly the waiter comes in and picks up on of our dishes and takes it away....."}
{"text":"My fiance and I love this place.  We rarely go out to yet, but when we do, we go to Stars of Thai.  The staff is so friendly and accommodating and food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"I would rank this place up there with \"old-school\" Salad King (years and years ago before they renovated), Young Thailand (before they closed down), and The One.

Now, no matter where you go, most Asian restaurants (Sushi-Japanese, Thai, Pho, etc etc) are always run by Chinese.  I don't know how that is a factor??  I've eaten at Arabic and Indian restaurants before run by Chinese, and they are fantastic!!  Your Italian designer clothes/bags are probably from China too.  How does that matter?

Anyways, I've eaten here many times.  Every dish is fantastic.  The Basil Chicken is spicy, and very fragrant.  Golden Curry Chicken is rich and full of flavor.  The bamboo shoots in the curry tastes fresh and not \"canned\" like other places.  I've also tried the Pad Kee Mao, Phad Woon Seen, and Phad See Ew.  All were delicious!

Pricing wise, you looking at around $9-12 a dish + drink.  Usually rings in at around $15-17 out the door including taxes and tip."}
{"text":"My team and I decided to come here for a team lunch - we ordered a variety of dishes from the lunch menu. You get a choice of soup or salad on the side, but neither seemed all that great. We all noticed that there wasn't much seasoning in everything we ordered. I personally got the veggie tofu dish (forget the exact name) with soup on the side - the rice was mostly plain, soup was really bland. I would say add your own seasoning and sauce on top and it should be okay. For the price it was good value, though."}
{"text":"So we walked into this place. No air conditioning. Just fans around trying to help circulate the hot humid air. My first instinct was to leave. 

But we were hungry and said whatever. This is how hot Thailand feels like.. we laughed. :)

Prior to deciding on the restaurant we did a quick check on the mobile yelp app. Reviews for the place appeared to be mixed. Some really enjoyed it and some didn't dig it all. Upon entering the place we saw a trip advisor sticker on the door too. Bonus we thought..

We decided on two dishes to share along with a couple of bowls of rice. 

First dish; 

Panang Curry (chicken) - dry,  rich and think with small amounts of coconut milk different from Red curry where that is more saucy. 

Second dish; 

Chicken with Peanut Sauce - sliced chicken breast cooked in a rich peanut sauce accompanyed with bamboo shoots and long beans. 



Okay without getting into a long story here are the points. 


The taste is more Chinese than Thai. 

The lime soda was nice as they used freshly squeezed limes. 

Heard some spanish guitar music in the background which was wierd. Thai music would be a more suitable choice.

Way too liberal with bamboo shoots in the dishes, would like to see them add more beans and peppers as noted in the menu description. 

Initial taste Bland. I couldn't really describe the food at first bite. We looked at each other for reaction and agreed there was no particular sweetness, sour, spicy or salty taste.. felt off as if the dishes were missing ingredients. 

Strong fish sauce taste/smell in the Panang Curry -- had not had else where. Not good.

Peanuts could be fresher, kind of tasted rancid. 

Positives: the decor - nice bambo entrance way, paintings on the wall leatherbound menus, and subtle touches like serving utensils were wooden, fork and spoon were huge but twist detailing . 

This was an honest critique. I hope the restaurant can take the suggestions and improve in delivering the rest of the dining experience. Looks and ambiance only go so far. I'm here for the food too."}
{"text":"I was craving some Thai food in uptown, as I live in Markham. the website looked good but I was a bit disappointed. I had chicken with red curry. The food was bland, it was served on a plate that reminds me of elementary school lunches and the look of the food was like that of a housewife who still is learning how to cook. the rice was a bit dry, as if there was not enough liquid used for the rice.

The service was very kind and the decoration was fine. But they played latin American music there, which was a bit strange.

I really wanted to like the food, but I did not. I am comparing to downtown Mengrai Thai, and the difference is like night and day although they are the same price level. I would give Mengrai Thai 6 stars if I could. This place gets two stars from me. I go back only if someone else insists to go there with me."}
{"text":"I got the lunch special chilli chicken. Charged me $2 extra for fried rice. Total of $15. Hardly any meat on the food and there is so much salt that you cannot eat the food. Ended up throwing it out. The service is terrible. Not coming back."}
{"text":"With so many good places for Thai food or Chinese or Japanese... This is not the Thai you are looking for.  The Mango salad was tasty and the lemon grass iced tea was tasty (ginger) but the main reason I came was for a nice Tom Yam on a cold night.
The soup was watery,  bland and totally unsatisfactory.  No ginger or pepper was to be found.  6  mushrooms and about 3 chunks of chicken.
Oh well, at least I got to warn you."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night and it was empty - only 1 other table beside us. 
Overall, the atmosphere is not bad but it was dark in there. The food itself is not bad.  Got the Curry and pad thai - but for the price I was paying I expected better and more.  The portion small.  Also, the waitress was kind of rude and I was with only my gf and the first thing they ask me is if we want separate bills in this broken english.

I would not go back as there is many more options that is better than this in Markham/Richmond Hill area.  This place doesn't stand out in any way that would make me go back."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Thai food, come here. Quality of curry met expectations. Not very busy most likely due to location, but good food!"}
{"text":"I didn't even know this was here, but a great choice for some Thai food. Came by one night for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. 

They have quite a large area, but it was not busy whatsoever. There maybe 3 tables at most sitting at any time for the duration that we stayed. It seemed that some people did come in for takeout though.

We decided to get one of the set meals on their menu, but switched out something for vegetables. The food was quite good overall, with quite a bit of taste to it. The portions were quite large as well, definitely a good amount of food to share. The food did come out pretty slow though, considering there wasn't anyone there.

Service was pretty good though, the server was very nice and moved quickly. Overall a pretty good place that is a little hidden."}
{"text":"This is probably not the best Thai food you're going to find in the city. However, I've been getting take out for 2+ years from here and the food is very consistent. Ingredients are fresh, and service is quick.  Some dishes may seem a bit bland - but that is fine with me because it's easier to find dishes that the family will agree on. 

When compared to other popular asian takeout places nearby, like Asian Legend, Congee Queen or food courts, the food does not suffer from the same awful aftertaste, and MSG overload.

The 5-star review is deserved due to the high degree of consistency, large menu choice (including hakka-fusion options) and quality of the ingredients relative to other asian restaurants."}
{"text":"Awesome food! We usually go a few times a month. The food is hot and fresh. We love their fish dishes. They have a blackboard with daily specials listed, we usually order something from there because it includes steamed rice. Tonight we had green beans in a garlic sauce, sweet and sour fish and Mongolian fish. Awesome! The prices are good too! Try this place if you're in the Woodbine and Highway 7 area in Markham."}
{"text":"Just got back from lunch here. First off, let me preface my review with some background on me: I've been looking for an authentic Thai restaurant for the past few years, since I went to the north of Thailand on vacation and was blown away by all the food there, particularly the street food. It would seem that Thai food in Toronto is what Chinese food in Toronto used to be 30 years ago... chicken balls and red sauce.  We have yet to start serving the \"real stuff\".

Anyway, we get here and the service was prompt and friendly. I noticed that the staff are all spoke Cantonese. We both ordered a lunch special: main course with 2 veggie spring rolls and soup of the day for $9.95. For the amount of food you get and the quality, it's worth it.

The soup was a coconut vegetable soup. It was salty and sour and super hot (temperature). It would be a disappointment for the vegetarians out there, as it was made with chicken broth. I had the basil chicken, while my coworker had the curry beef. Both were pretty good, but  nothing amazing. 

The place looked very nice, and would be a good place to have a lunch meeting with clients. Otherwise, we probably won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 dishes:
1. Vegetable Hakka Noodle
- very bland (even for a Hakka dish)
- smaller portion than we would have liked

2. Tofu Curry (eggplant, green beans and tofu in red curry).
- delicious taste !!
- more vegetables than curry so if curry is what you are looking for then you will not be satisfied

The decor was pretty nice, the restaurant itself was very clean but the tables were too far apart for my liking. The service could have been faster, we were one of 4 groups there at the time."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place many many times but decided to try it because of the yelp rating (4). 
I agree that the service is friendly and helpful, which made our experience really enjoyable.
The spicy mango fish was excellent. Fresh fish perfectly fried with  sweet and spice mango sauce. How can you go wrong?
I'll certainly come back again especially with the $10 coupon they give us."}
{"text":"I walked into the restaurant with a colleague from work. We were in uniform and had been working door to door in the area so maybe the waitress who \"greeted us\" was under the impression we were trying to sell her something, but never the less, her rude attitude towards us made us change our minds about eating there so we left. I'll never step foot in there again."}
{"text":"The pad thai comes with soup and a spring roll.  I've had it twice.  The price, taste and portion size are very good.  I admit I'm not an expert when it comes to Thai food so I can't comment on its authenticity.  But I know what I like and this place fits the bill.

It's odd that Stars of Thai Cuisine is usually almost empty...maybe they do more take out than eat in business.  The advantage of few customers is that the service is fast and there's plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I always come here for my Thai food. Food quality is consistent every time I order (Manchurian chicken chow mein) The pad sew was very good as well. I would give it a 4.5 star, because although the prices are on the moderate but modestly priced. The portions are very good. The service is always on par, friendly and prompt. Stars of Thai is a gem in the rough nestled off the ever popular highway 7 and woodbine."}
{"text":"I was hoping to give them more stars but slow service and poor quantity took that away.  I was going to give 3 stars, but food was not bad.  love beef on stick, green curry, and soup.  They serve Halal.  we were party of 5 adults, and 6 kids cost around $150 which is high for lunch.  but all in all not bad"}
{"text":"This was my first time being to this place and must say I really liked it! They have most of the thai dishes you expect on the menus.. 

I ended up ordering one of the lunch special, Basil Chicken I think. The place is nice and quite and service is good too. Definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and got the lunch special - Chicken hakka noodles.

The food was alright. Not completely flavourful but not too bland either. A little more spice would have made it great!

Portion size was pretty big and well worth the cost of $11. The lunch combo also includes the option of a spring roll with a soup, salad or a second spring roll. 

Location was convenient so I'll probably go back to try a few more of the dishes like the green curry and chicken fried rice!

Service was also great. Ordered 5 meals to take back to the office and each order was packed separately and good to go when we arrived."}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is somewhat above average, (Buddhist art and statues, etc,) & the location is slightly questionable for a restaurant of this caliber, as it's just nearby a burger king and subway.

The eggplant tofu is to die for, and I used to enjoy a vegetarian dish made with cherry tomatoes (but it looks like it's been discontinued).

The service at Stars of Thai is sporadic at best, but i'd be only concerned about this when looking for the complete package in a restaurant, otherwise sit back and enjoy one of the very few choices for authentic Thai food in the GTA."}
{"text":"If I were craving Thai, I don't think this is my top choice, but it's not a bad place to go if you're in the area. 
My family decided to try this place out on a weeknight and it wasn't busy at all. We got our table fairly quickly and began to review their menu. The menu was quite extensive and prices I think ran a bit high for what you're getting. In other words, not the best value, but not expensive per se. 

To start, we got tom yum soup which was very sour and then spicy, but not much flavour in between. I was a bit disappointed with that one. We also got the skewers platter. The skewers tasted alright with some nice grill flavour to them.
For dinner we ended up ordering chicken pad thai which I found quite decent, especially when you poured a bit of their peanut curry on it. The sauce was not too sweet, and had some nice flavours. We also ordered the veggie curry which I thought tasted fine. I would not be craving it though. We also got the special which was spicy beans of some sort and that came with a rice. 

My sister ordered a thai ice tea which was really creamy. We're big fans of thai ice tea and that was not one we would really order again. 

They do have a selection of Hakka food as well that we didn't try. So I suppose this is a fusion restaurant which means more options for everyone.

I think it's a hit and miss. Some people love it, some people just meh. Give it a try and see what you think for yourself :)"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch a few days ago. The service was super speedy which was nice, and the prices were not bad. All the lunch special options were sub $10.

I ordered the Nasi Goreng which i was very disappointed by. The fried rice was greasy and the egg was rubbery. The chicken and shrimp were essentially undistinguishable. I've had better nasi goreng at non-asian restaurants - I didn't even finish it.

My boss ordered ginger beef which was pretty good. The spring roll and sauce were very good, and i suspect that I ordered the wrong item. Next time, I'll try something thai."}
{"text":"First impression when i walked in...decent place. Nice and clean. I sit down. Order the manchurian chicken lunch special. Get the food in 5 minutes. I take a bite. BAM! Solid! I take another bite. Double whammy! I'm liking this now. I enjoyed till the last bite. Decent lunch special for $10...with a spring roll. Can't wait to go back again"}
{"text":"Some hits and misses for my visit.
Part of the Afternoon Dealite meal for $11.95 you get a pumpkin coconut milk soup. Wow, did I ever love the soup. Had a hint of sweetness from the coconut milk and just overall great flavour. The actual Afternoon Dealite meal itself was only so so. It came with a shrimp, chicken and beef skewers. I found the meat to be soft and mushy. Shrimps had no bounce in the meat. The peanut dipping sauce for the skewers was really think and just didn't like the flavour of the sauce itself. However, the sweet and sour dipping sauce for the spring roll was really good on the other hand. 

Also tried the green curry with chicken and rice for $8.95 + $3.25 for mango salad. The salad itself was really good. Mango was sweet and fresh but I found it lacking when compared to the mango salad I had at Linda Modern Thai Cuisine. The curry sauce had the sweetness of the coconut milk which I liked but thats all I really liked about it. The chicken meat itself was another so so.

There were not too many customers when I went for lunch so service was very efficient. 

Overall a good meal for an affordable price."}
{"text":"Really great food.  I'm from Los Angeles where there's a Thai restaurant on every corner and this is on par with the very best of LA.  In general, the dishes come with a generous amount of sauce and everything is properly cooked (nothing is burnt like at the average Thai restaurant).  

The vegetarian menu is particularly good and the Pad Kee Mao is the best dish I've had there.  The eggplant tofu is also particularly good, the spicy basil noodles and roast tofu are okay."}
{"text":"First off, its too bad there aren't half star ratings, because I would really like to give this place 2.5 stars. For me, 3 stars signifies an 'average' restaurant which I wouldn't mind to go back to. I will likely not come back to Stars of Thai Cuisine.

The restaurant is nicely decorated as other reviewers have mentioned. Nice wooden tables+chairs and some bamboo decorations throughout the place. Friendly owners/staff. Came here with my family for thai food, and ordered the following dishes:

Green Curry Tofu:
     - Overall, it was pretty bland. I had asked if they used fried tofu (my preference), but was told they lightly fried their tofu, rather than deep fried. I understand that this is a personal preference, but I think they should have just offered to fry it more. The curry itself was missing coconut milk and tamarind. We weren't asked for a spice level.

Phad Phed Talay:
     - This is a sea food medley consisting of squid, shrimp, and artificial crab. It was decent, but it tasted like Chinese stir fry, rather than 'Thai'. The sauce/curry was definitely lacking...something.

Phad Kee Mow:
    - I love phad kee mow and for me, it serves as the standard for the quality of a Thai restaurant. This was stir fry noodles with soy sauce. 

Crab Meat Soup Noodles:
    - I was expecting it to taste more spicy with a more tangy/sour taste similar to a Tom Yum Goong soup. Unfortunately it was nothing more than rice noodles with the soup consisting of tomato based broth. As an aside, I was surprised not to see Tom Yum soup on the menu, though perhaps it might have been the 'Hot and Sour' soup listed which we didn't order.

To summarize, I'd agree with some of the other reviews that this place is very much Chinese oriented in cuisine, rather than Thai. I'd like to give a better alternative for a Thai restaurant, but I just moved back home to Toronto recently after 4+ years. The positives going for this restaurant are the interior decorations and the convenient location close to the freeway, and standard prices on their menu. If they could only improve the quality of their food..."}
{"text":"It's nice here. The server is always happy and cheerful. Go here if you don't want a crowded place. They also have halal options"}
{"text":"This place was empty as hell on a Friday night! Food was ok. Mango salad plus curry beef rice dinner 13.50. Chicken pad Thai 12.50 ish. To me taste the same as going to the food court, but eatting smaller portion here. Though I guess taste a lot healthier. Wouldn't go back again.  the service is kinda odd too, first thing they asked when we sat down is, seperate bills? and they did that to every table that came in."}
{"text":"Doughy chilli chicken. Out of 10 pieces of chilli chicken bits, there were about 4 pieces of plain fried dough. Waste of one's money! Avoid this craphole money trap."}
{"text":"In Markham and decided to stop by for a bite to eat. OMG where to begin......so much selection on their menu. started off with Chicken Wonton Soup.....Mmmm! delicious. We followed with Spring rolls again mouth watering. food is freshly cooked. Our next dish General Tso chicken with mixed vegetables..what I love are the medley of spices  delecately combined and not overpowering. Service was good and staff friendy. The atmosphere was relaxing. will be back again. I call this place \"A Diamond in the Rough\""}
{"text":"Dropped by on a Saturday afternoon for  quick bite with the wife.

Here's my review:

Ambience:  non-existent.  No music. No staff but the 1 person.  And, no one inside at noon on a Saturday.

Food:  good size, but average tasting.

Service:  very average.  The server was quite awkward and didn't really interact much.

Overall, I doubt I'd be back."}
{"text":"A respectable place with decent food, and excellent service. Is it the best? No. It's not a place you 'must go to'. But if you're in the area, you'll be satiated eating at a value restaurant where the staff smiles are big."}
{"text":"Have been going to this place for years. This time was not that good. Ownership changed and the food quality went down. Food lacked in flavor and presentation. No longer recommending this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"My friend ordered food and had it delivered to my place and BOY.. I ended up EATING almost all of it! Best coconut curry chicken I have had from any Thai restaurant! When I am in the mood for Thai again, this will be my go to place! I want to try the rice paper veggie rolls and there crunch spring rolls next! The rice and chicken was amazing!"}
{"text":"I drove by Stars of Thai Cuisine at least 100s of time! I never even know it exist! Thanks for fellow yelpers in helping me to discover this gem!

We were here for dinner on a Sunday night at 7:30 pm, there was only 1 other table.
My dinner mate is getting antsy... \"should we leave?\" \"No! we have to eat here, I need to yelp about it!\" (I hope my fellow yelpers won't disappoint me!)

We order the mini appeitizer ($12.95)/Golden curry with Beef ($11.95)/Spicy Mango Fish ($12.95) to share. 

The mini appetitizer comes with green mango salad/chicken and beef satay/spring rolls/crispy dumplings. I have to say that all of them tasted good! The spring rolls and dumplings though deep fried are not oily at all! The satays both so tender not burnt! The peanut sauce for dipping one of the best I have.. not heavy with chunks of peanuts (I was eating it all by itself.. it is that tasty!) and the mango salad has the perfect herbs and coriander roots!!!

The Spicy Mango fish is on the Chef's Menu written on the chalkboard.  The fish they used is so fresh.. It was lightly battered and fried and top with the fresh mango and thai sauce. Beware of little chopped chilli peppers in the sauce.. I love them but it can be deadly for people that are not into spicy food!

Golden Curry Beef, not really spicy. But the beef are really tender. I can tell they use good cut of beef. I can eat 2 bowels of rice with the curry sauce..

For dessert, there are only 2 choices. Mango with Sticky Rice or Fried Banana with Lychee ice cream. Fried Banana it is. I have to tell you Lychee ice cream for sure is a better match to fried banana then vanilla ice cream! YUMMY!!

Service here is friendly and prompt. 

They accepts all credit cards.

I will be back to try out their lunch specials for $9.95 too!! (that comes with spring roll and soup of the day)"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with my boyfriend tonight. We ordered a mango salad, chicken pad thai, and green chicken curry. The pad thai and green curry were pretty good. However, the mango was way too raw, they were still green, hard, and sour. They put a lot sugar over the mango (we assume that the sugar is to mask the sour flavour of the raw mango). We asked if we could ask for a less raw mango salad. The waiter brought the dish inside the kitchen and came back out with the same mango salad, saying there's nothing they could do about it. At the very least, we expect that they could replace it with something else but \"there's nothing they could do about it.\" No apologies either. So we pretty much paid $8 for a mango salad that we didn't even eat."}
{"text":"I finally visited this place with my sister tonight.  We have opt for the combination offer which u can pick from a list
Which include a choice of salad or soup and a rice.  I have ordered the basil chicken and my sister ordered the pangnang beef.  The soup of the day is lemongrass soup.  The soup is very spicy but is tasted pretty good.  The basil chicken is alright, I should have pick a curry dish.  But on the other side the pangnang beef my sister ordered was aweful.  The dish was very fragrant, will def order that again next time.  In addition to the main course, we have also order then crispy pumpkin prawn.  It is pretty much a springroll dish, and I don't really see where is the pumpkin in this dish....
The dishes all came out piping hot and ingredients were all freshly prepared."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai cuisine in the GTA. Highly recommended.  I'm not sure why this restaurant has three stars and not 4 or 5. Don't be discouraged by the plain red/white sign. My experience has been nothing but positive.  As a plus, their vegetarian food is terrific and they have a very veggie friendly, knowledgeable staff. They will substitute chicken broth to make it vegetarian, something that very few restaurants do. Try their ginger tea!"}
{"text":"My co-workers recently invited me to have lunch at this hidden gem, I've been a frequent visitor ever since.  It is really hard to spot from hwy7, especially from the west, but it is in the plaza with the red roof where kinko's is.

My favorites are the Fresh Rolls (I like the chicken version, with grilled chicken slices), mango salad, chicken wings (yes, they have wings, and they are good!), Wonton Soup (The pumpkin soup is good too, but its a bit heavy for me), the red curry (the red curry duck is only available sometimes, keep your eyes on the special chalk board), the pad thai, and the banana fritters dessert.

Their lunch menu (9.95), comes with a dish from a list, spring rolls, a soup of the day, and a side of rice. Its great value and the atmosphere is nice, although it can get a bit crowded sometimes."}
