{"text":"This is a great family restaurant and the prices are great as is the food. It's old fashioned but great value. I'm a regular here."}
{"text":"Good for breakfast. Been going strong for decades. Server Charlotte is amazing. She's been there for over 60 years."}
{"text":"This is your ultimate greasy spoon type of place.  You walk in and seat yourself.  The decorations are from a previous decade.  It took about 10 minutes for a waitress to come over with menus and take our drink order.  The service was slow throughout the rest of our time there but everyone was friendly at least.  The food was better than I expected.  I had some type of meat lover's skillet with sausage gravy and my boyfriend had an omelette. Everything came out good and hot and a decent size portion.  This wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast, but the food was good and  cheap."}
{"text":"Although I've lived down the street from this restaurant for over 20 years, I have never been here.  I ordered a taco salad to go today and it was probably the best taco salad I have ever had.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Brunch at hazels today. My family and i decided to support local small business as much as possible.   Hazels is your typical small town diner. The food is decent served hot and good size portions.  Cost is reasonable and budget friendly.  Don't expect much in the way of decor.  But it's clean and comfortable with a small town feel.  The only thing i don't like is breakfast is only severed until 12. I'm a breakfast kinda gal."}
{"text":"Good food...clean..the servers are so friendly make you feel like family. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant i have ever been to..the waitress ( young blonde girl) never checked on us after plopping our plates down..she was too busy talking to her friends and horse playing around with the other customers that where friends of hers..oh and the racist remarks they made amongst each other and the hair i found in my food put the icing on the cake..never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant in my life."}
{"text":"The best in hometown food. The \"Meat Sensation\" plate..the best. Ive not had better Liver and Onions, outside my family..ever."}
{"text":"This is a great family restaurant that has really good food and friendly service.  Veggie omelet was great!!!"}
{"text":"All the servers are polite and the food is diner fare but prepared better than average with good prices. I have been coming here for about 20 years and have seen an improvement in the quality of the food in the last few years. The only downside is that the service can be a little slow from time to time especially when it comes to getting the check."}
{"text":"great service, food and prices.  Never disappointed.  Great for breakfast and lunch.
Nice hidden find."}
