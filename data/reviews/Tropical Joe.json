{"text":"This place used to be amazing when the guy who used to work there ran it. I went there recently and it was awful. The lady obviously didn't want to be there, she barely spoke English, didn't heat up the food until I asked (Likewise to my husband)... She just walked away from my husband when he went to order... I was really disappointed because this used to be one of my favourite places. Too bad.  Bramalea City Center one is a lot better."}
{"text":"They changed ownership and menu.  They are now a chinese fast food takeout pretending to serve carribean food.  The chicken curry is curry drumsticks.  How can they put that into the roti? Not too keen that this place menu has changed to become more of a Chinese food offering."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch one day as we were working in the area.    Ordered curry goat with peas and rice.  A typical order of mine.    The goat was just the right amount of spicy.  Can't complain.     I could appreciate that there was barely any bone to speak of.  In comparison to other places I have visited... I can give this place respect for that.   Ordered a small and found myself having difficulty finishing it.  Located somewhat off to the side of the food court."}
{"text":"Nice food n friendly staff . They have wide variety of Chinese food too . Chinese food better than their tropical cuisine"}
