{"text":"\"Cheat day #FoodPorn on a plate\"

So it has been a minute since my initial visit to Loch and Quay and based on the management contacting me to explain what happened,  I took a chance to stroll in randomly and try it out again for the first time.  

I randomly went in for lunch and they were open and ready to serve.  The lofty minimalistic decor is quite inviting, chill out and easy listening music soundtrack on the speakers.

The menu is compact and easy to navigate with A big emphasis on wholesome ingredients. My eyes had been set on the bison burger for a while so it didn't take too long to make decisions.

For the appetizer, the two tone bruschetta ($9) was a discovery of flavors with every bite.  Three slices of bread perfectly broiled with a hint of garlic and adorned with avocado humus, pickled tomatoe and smoked zucchini.  I am usually not a big fan of sweet in my meals but this combination was fantastic and absolutely delicious.  You will need to eat it slowly to truly appreciate the sensory flavors -  so, make sure that you don't gobble it quickly, Like those entry level, Chain restaurant, old news , \"classic tomatoe\" variety!

For the main course, the 6oz bison burger ($19), served with garlic aioli, lettuce, pickles and tomatoe on a toasted brioche bun with house-made seasoned fries was a cheat day #FoodPorn on a plate. 
At first, The burger did not appear that big - a little smallish - however, you could tell the 6oz weight as it was tall, full, thick and bold with flavor, perfectly grazing on the aioli and sweet pickles with every bite.   

The accompanying fries were a spectacle of their own, cut not too thick or too thin, skin on ,extra crispy and seasoned with a subdued hint of herbs and a garlicky-Parmesanish something that makes a guessing game of your palate as it explores and dissects the flavors.  

As if that wasn't enough, I am a ketchup person. I dunked the fries in the cup only to see actual herbs and perfectly pur√©ed  tomatoes ready for dipping.  This is not Heinz ketchup bottle fare; I could taste the fresh ingredients and herbs as it was obviously made in the back, baaaaam! 

Loch and Quay served Simple, wholesome, memorable good food today.  To some, the $19 price tag might sound a little Steep for a lunchtime burger & fries - but in this case; it is a premium and well worthy investment for your taste buds.   #FoodPorn"}
{"text":"Great spot. Worth checking out for sure. They are getting a patio so should be much more noticable in the summer. Food is amazing and they have enough space to throw decent sized events. There isn't much to choose from on Queens Quay so this is a much needed addition to the neighborhood. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for dinner the other night and the food was solid.  Overall, the menu was extremely creative and full of flavor.  The poke bowl was probably the best I've had (... and I've had my share of poke).  The salads were fresh and hearty.  Also, the restaurant had a great vibe and they had great beers on tap."}
{"text":"I love yelp I can always depend on the reviews.  We had a great dinner at Loch & Quay.  The beet salad was incredible.   The jerk chicken melted in your mouth with just the right amount of heat.  My friend had the steak and fries she was in heaven.  We had a wonderful sever and a great atmosphere.  It is definitely a place to go."}
{"text":"Went there on a whim and discovered one of the best restaurants I've been to lately.  Creative take on their dishes, absolutely delicious and surprisingly cheap!    
Staff was nice and friendly, cool/quiet atmosphere.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Alright guys, I came here tonight to catch all TORONTO games with a group of friends. I had a beer and an unreal kimchi Caesar for bev. For food I shared 18hr coffee braised brisket slider and a jerk chicken sandwich which was hands down one of the best in the city. Bold flavours and friendly staff. The chef/owner even came to say hi to us and sat with us a bit. A hidden gem in the quay area that is a must visit."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to meet up with friends before the Jays game, and this came up. A tip for anyone as you'll likely find better quality food and faster service here for a pre-game meal here than you would at places around Front St.

It's a surprisingly fairly small menu, but perhaps that allows them to focus on quality and consistency. In any case, most people should find something they would like to order. I would say that this qualifies as a 'gastropub' since you find a lot of familiar items, but with a bit more spin and flair on things and various fusion components. Almost half the entrees are grain bowls too, so if that's up you're alley, you certainly need to come here.

I had their bison burger which was cooked perfectly at medium, and also on a thick patty - whereas most of my other experiences with bison burgers has been a fairly thin patty. About the only thing that was 'meh' were the fries since they were too salty for my taste, but they were at least very fresh.

I had a lot of my friend's nachos which were fairly unique since they were topped with cotija cheese (similar to queso fresca) and pickled peppers. I thought they were pretty good as I started, but they grew on me even more as I continued to eat them. The two-tone bruschetta was REALLY good, maybe the favourite thing I had there. It has a layer of avocado hummous, and then layered with seasoned tomato and sesame. Basically a hybrid of avocado toast and bruschetta, but it worked really well.

There's a fairly good drink menu, and my friend was quite impressed with her caesar (which was spicy).

It was fairly quiet inside, and hopefully things pick up as they're a very good option with what seems like a can't-miss menu. Good value for everything too and cheaper than many other places nearby."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place and liked the menu. It has limited items but all of them are unique. We tried Sweet Potato Tacos and Beet Burger. It was a fusion and both had well balanced taste. I'm keen to try 'Indian' grain bowl, will visit again..."}
{"text":"We walked from the Intercontinental Hotel. It is deceiving from the outside. Cool vibe inside. We stopped in for a quick bite and drinks. They did not disappoint! Great nachos with brisket. The bartender was friendly, knowledgeable and fun. Give it a try you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"If you have allergies stay clear! Had heard great things so decided to try last night. The food was tasty however, despite a detailed review of the menu and advisement of allergies; within 25minutes of eating at Loch & Quay I spent the remainder of the evening on the bathroom floor violently ill. Clearly there is a lack of attention to detail, communication issues between the waiters and kitchen or just a big knowledge gap. Loch & Quay is definitely off the list."}
{"text":"After hearing so much about Loch & Quay (and thoroughly dissecting their menu), I decided to go there last Friday and see what all the buzz was about.  Luckily, I brought a large group so I could sample as many menu options as possible.  Although they suggested sharing plates, I really wish I didn't because everything was on point and mouth watering (I didn't want to share!).  From the \"Poke Bowl\" (my fav by far!) to \"The Sultan\" to the \"Bison Patty\", everything was jam-packed with flavor.  The venue itself was extremely inviting and I can only imagine how popular this place is going to be once the spring/summer months hit.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone (foodie or non-foodie) and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  Once again...get the Poke Bowl!"}
{"text":"I happen to know the owner and got a sneak peak at some of the food before they officially open. Putting aside the fact I know him, the concept of healthy fast food is fantastic and severely lacking in this area.   

The food he brought was prepared by 2 we'll known Toronto chefs and was delicious.    

Check this place out when you have a chance."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Food was fantastic and lots of new flavours. Service was great and you can tell everyone puts their best into the restaurant. Already craving the Indian with salmon again"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here today. 
The food was excellent. 
My husband had the tuna poke and I had the beet burger. Both choices we would rate 10 out of 10!!
The service was fast and friendly as well. We would highly recommend this restaurant.
A must to eat at, down at Toronto's lakefront."}
{"text":"My dining experience here far exceeding my expectations. From the moment we walked in we were treated like royalty. You can really taste the passion in the food made by Chef Devan. I am already looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Me and a coworker decided to take a long stroll along the Harbourfront, and obviously it takes a toll on you. Hungry, we decided to look around and found this tiny restaurant tucked in a corner along the way near the streetcar stop. 

The ambience is a very relaxed and modern setting, and we were greeted by a very quirky and bubbly server who was happy to seat us! 

I decided to order the poke bowl after browsing their Instagram page on what the different menu items look like (it was really really good by the way) while my coworker went in for the bison burger. 

The poke bowl consisted of this nice ginger and soy sauce tossed with black rice, and came with chunks of tuna and mango. Nice touch! It is definitely one of the better ones I've had. It was a little pricey, ringing up at  $17, but soooooooooooo goooooood. 

The bison burger, as he described it, was literally \"juicy\". The bun was nice and soft, while the meat was very thick, yet tender. He would not stop digging into it, that's for sure. The in house ketchup was a nice touch as well, and the fries that came along with it was quite alright!

All in all, what made our lunch/dinner good was the service and the staff. Everybody was quite friendly and we had a few laughs and moments with our server. Needless to say, that long walk was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered the brisket sliders, crab and shrimp cake and jerk chicken burger. My favorite is the jerk chicken burger. The chicken is super moist and juicy. Just the right amount of spice to add a lil kick .. loved it. Great service too. 
Parking available at the shoppers parking lot . Pretty cheap parking ."}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food. Both the poke bowl and jerk chicken were fresh and flavorful. Will update with longer review later on. Very much looking forward to trying the other offerings."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and this review is long over due.

Ambience: 
There are two sections. There is the bar section which is pretty lively but not too loud and another sections which is more intimate.

Food:
They seem to have a \"healthy quality ingredient\" theme/approach to their menu but they have hearty options available as well.

During my first visit, I had the Sliders, Poke Bowl, Jerk Chicken Burger & Banana Bread. Everything was great. The banana bread has this crunchy toffee thing and it takes it to a whole new level.

The Jerk Chicken burger is amongst the best in Toronto. Actually, it is the best.

I usually share plates when I go out and the kitchen was very accommodating and divided whatever they could on to two plates. 

My only complaint (well, suggestion) is that they don't have a breakfast or brunch menu and I hope they get on that soon. I live in the vicinity and options are limited. From what I understand, they don't deliver either. I would like to see them on foodora.

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"A small restaurant/bar tucked away at the bottom of one of the many condo complexes by the lake. It's new and up and coming with a modern menu of gourmet burgers and grain bowls. 

Not much of an atmosphere with flimsy plastic tables and chairs, no wall decor and some light music. For some reason the lights were out too, so it was a little dim. Hopefully a temporary issue. Apparently the space was being set up for an event, but they were still seating people for lunch.

Anyway, the menu is small but good. The rich bison burger served on a pretzel bun goes really well with the crisp cut, lightly salted fries. The brisket sliders are really juicy bites too.

Service was on the slower side, but overall some good menu options, just not much more than that."}
{"text":"I treated myself to lunch here. I ordered 'The Indian' .. I would def. order that one again, but I look forward to trying the other options as well. I also love the atmosphere of this place. The staff... extremely welcoming. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting from Las Vegas and staying in the condos upstairs from the business. The menu is small but full of tempting selections. The bison burger and jerk chicken burger were incredibly tasty and and we had to come back a second day for another helping. Loved the Brick house Cider to wash it all down. Perfect ambience after a long day of viewing your beautiful city."}
