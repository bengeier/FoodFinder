{"text":"Super excited when this opened. Nothing like it around here as far as I know. Surprised how much I liked the buffalo flavor. Just the right amount of spicy. I'll be back to try the rest."}
{"text":"So good! Unfortunately, closed Sunday! Pulled up next to 2 other cars looking to eat lunch there as well today!"}
{"text":"We ventured to this new spot today for lunch.  What a delicious surprise!  The owner, female  owned business another big plus, has done such a wonderful job with food and service.  We were greeted by a smiling and knowledgeable young man, who helped us through the menus with all (14) different types of chicken salad and the 4 different ways they can serve any of the flavors.  Scoops with one, two or three choices served with crackers and side choice and then the most scrumptious lil bite of banana pudding. Or the scoopwich a single type of chicken salad as a sandwich or wrap. And last, the garden scoop which is a single (or double) choice of chicken flavor atop greens.  We tasted 4 different types, the curry, the sweet berry, the waldorf and the popper (which has a crème cheese dressing rather than mayo based). We used our entire bucket of crackers spreading and exchanging tastes to everyone at our table.  All were so fresh and delicious it will be even harder to decide our selections on our next visit.  All white meat is used and that's another big plus!  I would say that pricing is moderate (but actually very reasonable when you see the size of each scoop) double scoop is $8.69 and triple is $9.89.  There are kids choices like traditional pbj and grilled cheese. For those non-chicken salad lovers, I guess there are a few, there is a roast beef or ham & swiss sandwich.

So great to try a new business that's not a chain and be so satisfied with the results!  I know we will be back many times.  Try it out....you'll be delighted!"}
{"text":"Here's the scoop. I had been wanting to try this place, but every time I was in the shopping center it was on a Sunday and they are closed. I finally made a point to visit this place today. After debating on which chicken salad to have, there are 14 options, and samples are available, I went with the Buffalo chicken - hot sandwich. It comes with a side, which I chose the broccoli, slaw salad and a very tiny key lime/meringue. The food was just okay, nothing special by any means. I found the sandwich to be small, and the the slaw tasted like it was directly from a prepackaged bag at Costco. I could have done without the dessert. And that's the problem, you are paying for items that you may not want, and it isn't necessarily cheap. I paid around $10, and I just wanted a chicken sandwich, which I could have got at The Habit, just up the street for $3 less.

It's unfortunate as I had high hopes for this place, but I probably won't go back. Too expensive for what you get, average food. And that's the scoop!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our chicken salad choices - original & sweet berry  along with broccoli slaw & black eye pea salad.  These healthy choices were a nice change from what's generally available for lunch.  They also had a refrigerated case with take out options."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Had the BBQ chicken salad, it was so good.  Everyone we were with loved what they ordered.  Super clean and great decor.  Will be back many times."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I had The Southern chicken salad on a Chopped Blue salad!   Generous potion, fresh and yummmmmy.  Cute atmosphere, super nice service too! I will be back to try The Buffalo chicken salad which they ran out of today   Probably because it is so good.  Oh yeah.   You get a yummy little homemade pudding cup included with your meal.   I had the peanut butter cup pudding.   Mmm"}
{"text":"The two scoop with one side is the way to go. 
The spicy Thai was very good and the portions were filling. The presentation is really spot on. Each scoop is served on a leaf of green leaf lettuce.  You can mix and match your flavor choices. The menu choices are enough to make u have to think twice before u choose. There is a flavor for just about every taste. spoke with one of the partners and was informed the scoops were 4 oz. So the 2 scoop is a half pound or 8 oz plus a side and a bump of vanilla pudding the size of a shot glass.   Great for lunch in the summer. The vibe is urban modern. So... A chicken salad lunch with a half pound of chicken plus a side , a shot of vanilla pudding and crackers for saddling the chicken on is  about 9.00 bucks with tax. My only thought would be to include a drink with this and it would be a great grand opening combo special. As I said above its a great alternative to hot food on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Went and had lunch there yesterday afternoon. After reading the reviews, I was really looking forward to something other than the usual hamburger joint/sandwich shop.

The chicken salad was good but not memorable. I had the trio which consisted of Spicy Thai, Veggie Dip and the Original. Couldn't finish it so I took it home for dinner, but no improvement on the taste. I felt the pricing was a tad high for what you got.

The staff was VERY pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"So I finally went to have the chicken scoop. It's very clean and has decent decor. They have different flavors of chicken salad served in scoops, and you are also offered samples to try.  I tried the one scoop meal of southwest salad and broccoli slaw, which was a good portion for me. I wasn't a fan of the pudding that comes with the meal. Overall a nice experience. I will surely go there again."}
{"text":"What a great experience.  I was going to get the Double Scoop, but one of the supervisors suggested for the extra $1.20 to get the Triple Scoop.  He said, \"Then you can get three different flavors and take the extra home for lunch.\"  So that's what I did.  I got the buffalo, curry, and sweet berry flavors, which were all great.  I also upgraded the side to a cup of soup (beef and bison chili)--delicious and a bit spicy.  We will be back!!  If you try this place, get there early--once they run out of a flavor, they are out for the day!!!"}
{"text":"I am very excited that this opened in my neighborhood. I went in for the grab n go section - I picked up 5 flavors- pesto, curry, buffalo, southwest, and the popper. I was impressed by all of them- all delicious! I also picked up some broccoli slaw and black eyed pea salad. I added the chicken salad on top of crackers at home, sharing a light quick meal with my family. 

I will definitely be back to try other flavors. I just love the fact I can get some really good food that is fast and convenient for me. I also saw they cater, which I will definitely do for my next get together."}
{"text":"Nothing about this place says WOW. Had the Original on croissant with side of fruit. Little high priced for what you get."}
{"text":"So many varieties of chicken salad to choose from! The Sweet berry is amazing!
Fast service, really friendly staff, cozy decor....."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with some friends and our children and it was delicious! I had the original chix salad and the pesto (which I crave now!). I liked the setting and the customer service. My only suggestion is to expand the children's menu and maybe a larger portion of chix salad on the sandwiches. Price point was good and I look forward to going back! Pudding is a nice treat too!"}
{"text":"Am visiting from the East Coast and looked on Yelp for a lunch spot.

Yelp,once again, you did not disappoint. My 5 stars says it all.

Two scoops,slaw salad and banana pudding had me humming . The scoops were of more than adequate size, enabling some to be taken with.

Two two scoop platters,delicious and under $20.00. Friendly and accommodating staff, and a clean atmosphere. 

We left as very happy campers."}
{"text":"Great place.  Good food, good nutrition numbers, very clean. Dear owners, well done on decoration / atmosphere and hiring.  Everyone was smiling courteous and seemed to be enjoying their jobs.  Will be back for sure!  Only thing to complain about is I hate bananas (banana pudding) but that's more my issue than yours"}
{"text":"We Had the Southwest melted scoop and the BbQ melted scoop. I liked my southwest. My husband liked his BBQ but thought it was a bit dry for his taste but in my opinion the texture on chicken salad is different for everyone.  

Great for a light lunch. if your hungry, may not be the right stop."}
{"text":"What a great change from burgers and burritos!  I ordered the sliders meal, three mini-scoops of chicken salad on small slider buns; curry, Poppers and Waldorf, all great plus a side of broccoli slaw.  Good value, clean and bright, no smell from the fat fryer!  Food came out in a timely manner.  Yes, I will return."}
{"text":"This place is great for lunch! The Berry chicken salad was yummy and light. The black eye pea salad was delicious and I love the little bit of banana pudding treat! Decor is nice and they have comfortable booths. Super nice staff. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times.. the first time was just ok, but they did have good potato salad, so I have them another chance.  Long wait with minimal ppl ordering/in the restaurant and plenty of staff.  Also, the chicken salad look nothing like the pics online.  The pics make it look a bit chunky.. it's actually very stringy and more the consistency of pet food.  Time #2.. EXTREMELY long wait when almost no one was there (except like 5 staff being the counter) and 3 ppl ahead of me to get their order.  I waited 20 minutes at a table and asked for it to go.. we didn't have that kind of time.  I got a salad, my kids the soup and potato salad.  My salad was just ok, the poppy seed dressing was not at all sweet, pretty sour, so I wondered if it was ok to eat and tossed it, used my own.  Time #3.. walk in, another woman is staring at the menu, we look too to figure it out.. my 7 year old does like their soup.  A few minutes later, employee comes over to let us know they are out of basically everything except 3-4 of the most unappetizing types of salad.  Ugh.  We just walked out.  Why wait to say something?  I've given up on this place.  It will be out of business soon anyways it's always mostly empty.

To earn customers back, work on customer service, speed it up (ie- if a register isn't taking someone's credit card, don't hold up the line, open the next register!  Genius!), and make the chicken less mealy."}
{"text":"First visit responding to a flyer we received in our office. Very nice clean welcoming place.
Had the Caesar, very dry tasteless. Side was the broccoli slaw, very good.
Wife had the Pesto, very good, although dry. She ordered the side of Black eye pea. After receiving at the table she took it back to the counter and ask if she had the correct side explaining I don't see any black eyed peas. The young lady at the counter said, see there's two.
After the lunch my wife took the lettuce that served as the bed that the scoop arrived on. Both were very wilted and black on the edges. This time the girl go the mgr from the back, he said yes, it is a little too old. She ask again about the Black Eyed Pea, he said yes we are thinking of changing the name of that salad.
My wife stated we did not want anything for free, just a nice place to have lunch. No apologies."}
{"text":"Superb option! Great concept! Always very good food and service, on the healthy side and not expensive, fun, interesting.  IMO any review under 5 stars for this place is unwarranted."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place today for the first time. Sounded like an interesting concept so had to give it a try. My co-worker and I were both quite impressed with how tasty everything was. From the actual chicken salad, to the sides, and the banana pudding. Another major plus was that there were plenty of options that don't have mayo if you want to keep it healthy. Definitely will be added to my list of go-to lunch spots in the area."}
{"text":"I've seen this place many times but never went in until today. Amazing!! The food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is really pretty. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out. However, expectations lead to disappointment. 1. This place is really confusing, six employees standing around, somebody should be greeting and navigating through the menu. 2. We both tried the chicken sandwiches on nine grain. The chicken scoop was dry and the bread was so dry that it wasn't worth continuing eating. We both left disappointed. When some young kid asked us how things were I think he was stunned with everything that wrong, that he just looked at us and said ok. No apology, no willingness to make it right. Needless to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"I love chicken salad, so I had to check  this new place out!! I had the Waldorf chicken salad sandwich. The bread was super fresh and chicken salad was yummy!! My friend got the southwest chicken salad and it was very good too! 

Loved the decor and it was very clean!! 
For my meal a drink and a kids meal it was $18 which I thought was pricy. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE the décor of the restaurant.  The concept is awesome!  Anyway, I ordered the plate with 2 scoops, buffalo chicken & waldroff, both were very tasty.  They do not use a lot of mayo so the chicken salad didn't have that greasy taste, it was really good!  The coleslaw is yummy and you get a mini dessert, which was a perfect size.  If you like chicken salad you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Scoop is a pleasant revelation. Based around chicken salad, you choose a base flavor and then pick a portion. In my case I had \"The Sliders\" which consists of your choice of any 3 scoop flavors on slider buns: the BBQ, the Pesto, and the Southern were my choices and each was quite tasty in it's own right. A side of Loaded Potato Salad completed the selection. 

The space is nicely laid out with booths along one side and numerous tables in the center. The staff is really welcoming and informative on the menu, considering it's definitely a unique concept. They're more than happy to guide you through the ordering process are enthusiastic about the menu.  Refreshing.

Give The Chicken Scoop a try when you're in the area shopping at Cost Plus or whatever your favorite spot is.  A fun spot."}
{"text":"I really liked it for a good lunch spot! The chicken salad was well done and I chose the Thai spiced version which was delicious. The meal came with chips and a cute little pudding cup which was fantastic(banana)."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. My favorite is the bbq chicken scoopwich on a croissant. Not a huge fan of the potato, needed more flavor. Yummy banana pudding cup dessert!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Got two scoop ceasar and Waldorf. You get a side and pudding, great meal! The pudding is such a nice little bonus to top off a delicious meal. I came with a Groupon but will definitely be back again and again"}
{"text":"Will not return.  The consistency and flavor are way off.  We were really looking forward to trying this place and hoping for fresh chicken salad with chunks of chicken and ingredients you could see.  The chicken salad seems way over processed and lacks in flavor.  I had the original and bbq and my husband had the southern and bbq.  As well, my diet coke tasted very odd.  I see another reviewer mentioned odd tasting water, maybe something is wrong with their ice??  So disappointed."}
{"text":"Great chicken salad! However, the food comes in a tray that reminds me of a prison. Pudding tasted like it came from a prepackaged putting cup. The restaurant is clean. However there is no station for straws or napkins or any other condiment, you must ask the people up front where they are or if you can have any. That usually is not an issue but the staff was nowhere to be found they were all in the back hanging out. Overall I give this place a 3 out of 5 because the chicken salad is really good."}
{"text":"Always reliable service and food. I keep trying to branch out but I love my favorites so much I keep sticking to them (Waldorf & spicy Thai). Super filling."}
{"text":"Great concept and was pretty tasty. Even comes with some crackers; which totally cracked me up. ( get it ?). No really it's how I eat it at home so it was amusing. 
Tried out Thai peanut and spicy wing. Neither were spicy but had a lot of flavor. Huge chunks of chicken inside each scoop which usually means it was made by hand. The potato salad was ok, but I am a bit particular about it. Perfect meal on a hot summer day. 
Super friendly counter service and knowledgeable helpful staff. This is important being this can be a bit confusing. 
Will try to get back here some time soon and try some other flavors. 
It does get busy during the weekday especially around noon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite go-to lunch items is a chicken salad sandwich so imagine my excitement when I learned of The Chicken Scoop which serves 14 different kinds of chicken salads! ... That's right - FOURTEEN! Their menu consists of Scoop Meals, which include 1, 2, or 3 scoops of chicken salad with a side, crackers, and a pudding cup, as well as sandwiches, salads, and soups.

My fiancé and I stopped in for an early dinner and got the 3 scoop meal with the BBQ, the PESTO, and the SOUTHWEST chicken salads, along with 2 sides of the Loaded Potato Salad. The Southwest was my favorite out of the three because it had an ample amount of southwest seasoning making it the most flavorful chicken salad that we had gotten. The Pesto was a close second favorite (and actually my fiancés favorite) since it still had a distinct and yummy pesto flavor. We agreed that the BBQ chicken salad was good, however it would've been better with a bit more BBQ sauce for additional flavor.

The 3 scoop meal size was perfect for us with the additional side. We both enjoyed the Loaded Potato Salad but I would like to try out one of the other sides next time. As I previously mentioned, I'm a huge fan of chicken salads, and this place was a thumbs up for me. I'll definitely be back to get a Scoopwich next time!"}
{"text":"I got the wardolf And the Southwest!! Both really good!! My husband got the cesar  and he LOVED the chocolate pudding!  Food is really great!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  They offer healthy chicken salad options and even to go containers so you can bring it home and meal prep during the busy work week!  My first time in I ordered the waldorf and the buffalo.  Both were amazing and I can't wait to go back and try more kinds!  I hope this place opens up more locations, especially one in Old Town Scottsdale where my office is located! I don't see myself getting sick of this place anytime soon and with so many options I don't think I ever will!"}
{"text":"Wow!! This place is so delicious! I am so happy I found this spot.. The food is fresh, the service is fantastic and I love the little banana pudding you get with your meal. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little place with great service! The food was really good and I liked the concept. I got the original chicken salad and my boyfriend got the pesto, and they were both really good. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"For those who follow my reviews, you know that I never give a five star rating. There is always something that can be improved. This is not the case here. The food was very fresh, high quality, perfect portions and the staff was very friendly and professional. This was our first time at Chicken Scoop and I was uncertain about what to order. I was asked if I wanted to try a sample before I placed my order. Although the restaurant serves only chicken salad, there are 13 ways it is prepared and a variety of ways it is served (scoop, sandwich, wrap, etc). The sides are equally fresh and tasty and the desserts are delicious. The Chicken Scoop is very clean inside, a real bonus. You can order takeout or eat in. But be aware, you order at the counter and then it is prepared and delivered to your table. We will definitely be back!  I encourage you to give it a try.  BTW, I am not a friend or relative of anyone who works here or who owns the business"}
{"text":"Hubby and I stopped in tonight for the first time for an early/easy dinner. We were very impressed and will definitely be back. The adorable farmhouse decor was so pleasant and immaculately clean. The guy behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. The best part was the meal. We each got three scoops, and decided we liked Popper and BBQ the best, but all were very good. The flavors are subtle but yummy. Also liked the potato salad side and banana pudding. A fun and delicious meal, very good value because we took home enough food for tomorrow night!
Try it!"}
{"text":"Visited here at noon on Oct 4. We immediately loved the interior and seating space. As we were studying the menu a young lady came and briefed us on the menu. I chose the Waldorf chicken salad with apples, walnuts and grapes with the potato salad. My wife chose the very berry chicken salad with pecans and  cranberries. Would give the potato salad a C grade. It could use more sour cream and seasoning. Actually to dry for me. We enjoyed our chicken salads and give them a B+. In order to get an A it needs more mayo and seasoning. Over all we enjoyed and will be back"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a bite to eat after shopping for furniture. This place is super cute, extremely clean the employees are great! My food was good, it's a nice spin on chicken salad with a creative menu. Overall I'd come back and try another sandwich."}
{"text":"My wife went with a friend for lunch for the first time at Chicken Scoop.  They left very happy.  Service was great, food was great and ambience was the same.  She loved it so much that she ordered a chicken Waldorf salad and and a Jalapeño chicken salad to go for the family at home.  Was awesome.  Pricing is extremely reasonable for the value.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very interesting concept! I had one flavor with croissant and my boyfriend got three flavors with crackers. Chipotle one I had on a croissant was alright (I wouldnt recommend trying it with croissant it has no taste at all) but BBQ and Thai are sooo flavorful and delicious! Only the down side is it is far out in N Scottsdale (we live in Central phoenix). We were there Sun around 1pm and there were a lot of people there but only two people (one cashier and one in kitchen) it took almost 30 minutes to get our order that was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Sitting here eating my puréed chicken salad. Seriously it is PURÉED! Great place for nursing home residents who don't have teeth.  The chicken salad has no texture except the lettuce and tomato.  Worst chicken salad ever. Even Costco canned chicken is much better. .  Enchilada soup is tasty with beans and nice broth. The husband liked his potato salad but it had no seasoning. The sweet 16 year old hostess couldn't get the order. Nice interior marred by another kid mopping constantly. They top off the plate with a mini pudding made from probably a mix with banana flavoring.  Looks cute.  Not great except for a little kid. Had high hopes for a cute restaurant but I next time would head on down to the Habit!"}
{"text":"My wife loves chicken salad so it was inevitable that we end up here. Great place with friendly, helpful team members. 

Nice clean environment with a modern take on the traditional quick service furniture-think 5 guys, but more inviting. They did have the sappy \"lemon\" decorations I find at places that try to show they are healthy, but not too much of it.

Crew was friendly and clean, kitchen is clean and organized-which leads me to belive they run a tight ship when it comes to health and safety.

Food was excellent and they even gave samples to make the experience more approachable. I had the melted scoop and it was delicious. Crispy buttery bread, medium melt on the cheese, simple plate presentation. 4 stars, enjoyed it, will be back."}
{"text":"We love chicken scoop! The Sweet Berry and Southern are both great! This is such a cute little lunch spot! What a creative concept!"}
{"text":"This is a perfect lunch spot!!! I'm in sync with all my other yelpers, I just love the chicken salad here! 

The place is very fresh and modern and clean, always a plus for a food establishment.  I really couldn't decide but ended up with the chicken pesto toasty, which is basically a grilled cheese with chicken salad in it. 
The chicken salad is so good. I can definitely see myself stopping by for a grab-and-go container of a different flavor to try it out. In fact, I can predict this place to be in my lunch  weekend merry-go-round for awhile.

Despite the fact that I ordered the grilled cheese, one of my favorite parts is the nutrition facts are displayed online. In chicken salad, a \"healthy\" sandwich can crank up 300 calories easily with too many calories. 

The refreshment stand was clean, and the iced tea was fresh. It was an overall delightful lunch on a beautiful day. 

I'm looking forward to coming back! 

On a side note, I'm frustrated with Yelp's latest question when you check in and you ask me if there are Gender Neutral Restrooms. It just really gets under my skin to be asked by one of my favorite sites a completely irrelevant question, and find it hard to believe that is the basis on which people make their dining decisions."}
{"text":"Big fan of chicken salad. This is the in-n-out of this genre. They do one thing and do it well. Lots of variety. Fast service, great quality. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Good place to go for lunch.  The premises are very clean and 

We had the best server, Tiffany ,  she was amazing. Super efficient with just the right amount of attention. 
I had the garden salad scoop and the Waldorf scoop. I much preferred the Waldorf scoop. 

Next time I would pair the Waldorf scoop with a spicy scoop. As the vegetable scoop was very bland."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. Folks in line were super friendly, staff not so much. I had the Southwest chicken scoop. It was ok, didn't blow my mind. Thought is was kind of expensive. Cute interior. Approximately 4 hours after eating I was nauseous and had a stomach ache. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  I should be a southern girl.  I could eat chicken salad everyday.  I've had a few of their different flavors and they all have been good.  Some are more smooth, like a spread than others.  I usually get one scoop with the side and I love the little treat for dessert.  The first time I had the curry and my husband had the spicy thai.  He loves, loves, loves the spicy thai.  It is really good, but I love the curry.  I have also had the southern, southwest, buffalo (this one is more like a spread) and the popper.  I have loved them all.  The sides are also very good.  I love the broccoli slaw, the black eye peas quinoa side is also great and the loaded potato salad is super yummy.  The usual treat is the banana pudding, but now, during the fall holidays they are offering a choice of banana or pumpkin.  The place is always clean and the service is very friendly.  I enjoy coming here and having a yummy break."}
{"text":"Great as always! Love the Southern Style and absolutely adore the loaded potato salad! I think they tweaked it to be even better! Flavor suggestion: original with miracle whip instead of mayo = childhood memories!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice. Food is really good with a great list of flavors. My favorite Original, Waldorf, and BBQ. We also tried the Curry, Pesto and Sweet Berry.  Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I have had this place bookmarked for a year now and finally made it today. It was miserably hot out and were looking for something lighter than burgers and fries and The Chicken Scoop did not disappoint. Everyone else had the same idea as the place was quite busy so ended up getting our order to go. They have a cooler with their flavors of chicken salad and in two different sizes ready to grab and go. We ended up with the BBQ and the pesto. I LOVED the BBQ but the pesto was just ok. The BBQ was so flavorful but there was nothing memorable about the pesto. They packed up our two containers with a ton of crackers which was the perfect way to enjoy the chicken salad.

The restaurant is light and bright and quite cute. I look forward to dining in the next time we are in the area as there are many more flavors to try. 14 flavors in fact."}
{"text":"I've never been to a place like this before but I'm glad I went. I've eaten here 3 times now. They're open in the morning which is really awesome. I get the Chicken Pesto or the Chicken Caesar melted scoopwich. It's like crunchy on the outside and I think it's great."}
{"text":"Great chicken salad! 
There are lots of flavor options. I had Thai chicken salad.
I am not a fan of chicken. I will eat this chicken again and am excited to return and try other seasoning flavors.
I also tried the broccoli slaw. It was fresh and delicious.
The restaurant was clean and pleasant staff.
Nice find!"}
{"text":"Who would have ever thought you could open a restaurant based only on chicken??  Lol
There is about a dozen varieties of chicken salad. We tried the original which was fantastic. Just the right amount of ingredients. We also tried the BBQ which was delicious and had a mild smiley flavor. The BBQ was not overpowering. We also tried the southern version.  It was like a blend of deviled eggs and chicken salad.  There is a hint of sweet relish too. Excellent on all 3. 
The nice surprise at the end was delicious banana pudding.  I hope they find great success. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Love the southern w egg, the cranberry w pecans, the quinoa side, the loaded potato salad and the banana pudding. I don't love me the Waldorf because the flavor is lacking something and am heartbroken they took the veggie off the menu."}
{"text":"First of all, this place is decorated adorably. A really clean, fresh vibe the moment you walk in. Employees are very polite and attentive. 

There are A LOT of flavors of chicken salad to try which is what initially brought us in. We tried several with my favorites being BBQ, Buffalo and their original flavors. We loved the complimentary pudding cup they serve with each order. Just enough of a little something sweet to end the meal. 

The staff stopped by our table twice, asking how our meal was and if they could refill our drinks. As we left, two employees thanked us for coming in and wished us a good afternoon. 

Overall I like the place. Good food. Friendly employees. Cute place. I'm not sure if their flavors are seasonal or rotate but we'll be back soon to try more of them. Nice new option for lunch in the North Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I reviewed this place 9 months ago. And gave it 2 stars. This time I again tried the original scoop on a croissant.  Again It was bland but there was an unusual  taste to it. The scoop is mushy. It hasn't improved.  The employees are still flat and not friendly.   No more tries."}
{"text":"Nice clean place. It's a good concept. You can get a scoop of their many varieties of chicken salads or you get a sandwich or green salad with the chicken salad. I have ordered the sandwich with pesto chicken salad. The food was OK but the portion was small. It may be enough for you if you are not very hungry and looking for a light lunch but I didn't leave the place full. When you pay almost $10 for a sandwich and a small side you expect more food or at least a very tasty sandwich, it was neither of those."}
{"text":"The Chicken Scoop is a great new concept that opened about a year ago in The FLW Spire Promenade on Scottsdale Road. 

Simply put, you can buy one, two or three scoops of your favorite flavored chicken (see menu) and one side. That's it!

On our most recent visit, we ordered the One Scoop (Curry) Garden Salad.  It came with a Side Salad and a petite Banana dessert for $8.59, see photo. I ordered the Triple Scoop (Chipotle, Spicy Thai and Jalapeño Popper), with a Side of Loaded Potato Salad for $9.89 and the petite Strawberry dessert (photo).

All their chicken scoops have a very minimal of additions, like walnuts, raisins or celery, depending on which flavor you order.  It's up to you to add the Mayonnaise, etc. Nice!

We really liked our Lunch and thought everything tasted great. The focus here is on the flavor and simplicity, which is what I believe makes the Chicken Scoop so special (particularly if you are dieting).

Expect to pay $10 each, depending on Sides and soft drinks. Our bill came to $23.60 including taxes. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I decided to finally try this place as it is close to my work. There is a huge menu of items which made deciding what to order difficult but I ended up getting the sliders which came with 3 scoops of different chicken salad, a side and dessert! The portions were a good size but there could of been more seasonings on the chicken salad choices."}
{"text":"I have quickly made this place a weekly dinner/lunch spot when I'm feeling a bit lazy. I've been in four times and have told all my friends about this place! 

Growing up I never enjoyed chicken salad. I thought it was reserved for my grandparents and it was never something I wanted to take home as leftovers. The scoop changed all of that! There's tons of flavors and you can try a spoonful of them all before you order them. I usually get a double scoop and switch it up between their Thai flavor and curry, with the sweet berry chicken salad. What's better? They give you a choice of side (broccoli slaw is the best to me) and a banana pudding! What kind of amazingness is that!?

It's a little tricky to find at first but trust me it's worth it. It's in the promenade next to some weird rustic store. 

Also! They love military and the place looks like Pinterest exploded in a good way."}
{"text":"Yum, I can't wait to go back to try the rest. Just got one scoop of the waldorf with a small side salad. Love the banana pudding side, it touches a bit of each of my favorites. I'm excited for a different place to eat than the traditional and although a bit pricey, with my drink it made it a $10 lunch I still can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really liked the concept of this place and the food was good, but I'm not sure it has staying power.  Prices are fair also."}
{"text":"Interesting take on Chicken salad.
While it is an interesting and a different take  on chicken salad, I am just not the biggest fan. I ordered a Southwest double scoop with a side of loaded potato salad.
Note, it is better on a salad or sandwich then getting the single-triple scoop by its self with a side."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Chicken Scoop. Seriously the execution of the entire experience and this be the first location of which I hope to be many is phenomenal. 

The farmhouse, nostalgic, contemporary and yet very very clean look with the baby blue themed colors make me feel at home and very welcomed to sit down and enjoy a meal. Every time I eat here the chicken scoops are plenty, very very very flavorful, I get something different each time and I love the puddin'!!! This time I got the Buffalo and Waldorf scoops with Strawberry Puddin' with side of fruit. The value to the portions you get is fantastic. 

The food overall is fantastic because it's fresh, healthy, not a lot of nonsense additives, and I don't get that heavy feeling after eating. The place is very well kept consistently with tables cleared and cleaned immediately, counters don't have mess on them, and the restrooms are spotless. 

I had a chance to meet the owner, Dana, who is a wonderful and smart woman who gets it. She gets everything how to run a business and it's with excellent service and a quality product. The staff she has is amazing, all were friendly to me, and also thanked me for coming in. 

If you haven't tried it, you need to. I am a customer for life."}
{"text":"Service was excellent to include fast unlike Firstwatch (across the street).  The chopped salad and chicken salad were great - not heavily dressed and flavorful.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast nothing fancy ordered the eggs with potatoes,  bacon  the gal informed me the potatoes they had she was not happy with and had to roast a new batch  I appreciate she told me but I know it takes a while to roast , the bacon was pre cooked and not thrown back on the flat top before serving so it was almost room temp but not quite the toast must've been toasted and then sat there for 10 minutes so it was kind of dry and brittle the fruit I got in place of the potatoes were strawberries and grapes which were fresh about the only redeeming quality of the whole breakfast thanks but no thanks"}
{"text":"Love the Curry Scoop and the Banana Pudding Scoop.   Have been coming since the grand opening."}
{"text":"Finally, a delicious new lunch option by our office! I had a really difficult time choosing between four and five stars but decided to round up. 

First of all, cutest restaurant ever! Decor is adorable and welcoming. And my favorite, the restaurant is clean. as. a. whistle! Nice and cool inside, too.

I got a Garden Scoop meal, which was a fresh garden salad with mixed greens, diced cucumber and shredded carrots. The salad was SO fresh and came with a yummy herb dressing I asked to be served on the side.

The two scoops I ordered were the buffalo and southwestern scoops. Both were super fresh and surprisingly light for them being chicken salad. Not too overloaded with mayo, very well balanced. They could have had more flavor, but I think it still works because of how light and fresh they tasted. Maybe they didn't want the chicken scoops to be overpowering, especially since I imagine most guests here will mix and match flavors. 

One funny thing did happen -- I went to sprinkle some pepper on my meal and the top fell off and into the food. Pepper everywhere! I just scraped it off and went on with my meal. Ha! 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love chicken salad, so needed to give this place a shot. When you walk in, it's very open and inviting. They immediately offered samples of anything I wanted to try. I tried the spicy Thai and curry. Both good, but I chose others. Menu is very easy and straightforward. If you don't like chicken salad, leave now. 
I got the jalapeño popper and the southern style. Popper has jalapeños and bacon with cream cheese. Yummy, but I do wish there were a little more jalapeño and crunch. The southern is delish too, with eggs, sweet relish, onion.. and I can really taste the sweet relish, which is nostalgic to me! (Reminds me of grandmas potato salad!) 
I added a side of soup. This is where they loose a star. Considering the chicken salads are very clearly made in house and fresh, I thought the soup would be too. Their soup of the day was pot roast and veggie. Absolutely canned, pre made soup. I am a soup snob, for sure. It tasted like Dinty Moore stew, which my dad used to make us eat growing up. It had that gelatinous mouth feel and the veggies and potatoes were mush. 
Anyway, didn't go there for the soup! I'll stick with salad next time!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Scoop is a casual restaurant located in the Promenade Shopping Center that specializes in chicken salad. They offer FOURTEEN flavors of chicken salad that you can order in a variety of ways such as sandwiches, wraps, salads and platters of one, two or three scoops that come with a side and a small pudding scoop. A few other items are offered and they also offer a children's menu.

This restaurant has an attractive modern fresh farmhouse style of decor. At the time of my visit  they had a person that welcomed you in an offered to explain the menu to you. You are welcome to taste samples to decide on your order. Service is casual. You order at the counter, take your oder number, get your drink and seat yourself. 

My husband and I both had two scoop platters of chicken salads that come with a choice of side and a pudding scoop. Someone ran our plates out to us and gave us a bucket of crackers to eat with the chicken salads.

I had the Buffalo that was flavored with Red Hot Wing Sauce and the Spicy Thai Chicken Salad that was made with spicy Thai Peanut sauce and cashews. The Buffalo tasted like red hot sauce. I didn't really get much of a mayonnaise taste and the salad was drip free. The salad was nicely flavored but ONE THING was ODD to me......The lack of crunch and texture. The salad was very smooth like a spread. I really wanted some celery sticks or carrot sticks with this salad. The crackers made this flavor too salty for my taste so I had to eat it plain and straight up with a fork.

The Spicy Thai had a little more going on with it than the Buffalo Flavor and was ok with the crackers. This salad also lacked crunch and texture. 

My husband had the Southern (eggs, mustard, sweet pickle) and the Caesar. Both of us thought the Caesar lacked the Caesar Taste. (garlic, anchovies and Parmesan cheese, black pepper)

All four of the salads I tried lacked texture and crunch.

I LOVE the concept, cheerful service and atmosphere but I'm just not a fan of the lack of crunch and texture to these chicken salads. A raw vegetable side option will be a very good option that I hope they offer in the future.

Three stars means A-OK but I have some reservations

I also note that this restaurant has only been open about a month at the time of this review and might still be working things out."}
{"text":"Mmmm that Buffalo Chicken Scoop, though!!! SO GOOD! And their tiny little pudding scoop they give you - delicious! I was not expecting that kind of yumminess! Loved it."}
{"text":"Fresh salad, great mix of greens and dressings.

Nice service.

I'll come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent food, clean and nice place and great service. Both my wife and I enjoyed it thoroughly I will be going back in the near future regularly."}
{"text":"Brought my mom and sister here for lunch yesterday. My sister had the original, I had the Jalapeño popper and my mom had a turkey sandwich. All three of us loved our meals. The place was spotless and the staff was incredibly friendly but not over the top. They had the fruit salad on the side and raved about the cantaloupe and I had the loaded backed potato salad, both were great. The kicker was the banana pudding at the end. A delicious personal touch. 


I really hope this place sticks around because the jalapeño popper was amaze-balls and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and the food is incredible! The staff is great. My only complaint would be that they are not open a little bit later."}
{"text":"Went the second day they were open and took a bit to review but I've been back twice since then. I LOVE chicken salad...it really may be my favorite food. This is excellent chicken salad, made with premium ingredients and their creations are inventive and delicious. I've had the Curry, BBQ, Southern, Waldorf and Original. Waldorf is my favorite but yet to have one I did not like. My only suggestion would be to offer lettuce cups as an alternative to crackers when dining in. It does come on a piece of lettuce per scoop but just a few more pieces (like lettuce wraps at a Chinese place) would be welcome. Also, the sides are really good and are so much more than boring side dishes. My wife likes chicken salad but not as much as me.....she loves for the loaded baked potato salad side and the slaw...both of which are excellent. It's a really cute restaurant and I hope they do well because the concept is great and pricing excellent for the quality of the food. I can see myself stopping by for 1-2 takeout varieties with great frequency. I find that center a little confusing and wish it was closer to me in Arcadia, but it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Stopped in right at open time. Had a hard time choosing 2 a la carte scoops from all the delicious descriptions. Service was quick and friendly. The Waldorf was my favorite and I will absolutely be back with the fam next time. Yum! Thinking this place would be perfect to have catered for a event."}
{"text":"I had the Melted Scoop with the pesto. It was sooooo yummy!! I loved it a lot! I can't wait to try the rest of the flavors!!! The girls in the store was awesome, great customer service. I came in around 2:15 on a Sunday, they close at 2pm but they still let me place an order!"}
{"text":"What a gem! 
Ate here for the first time today with a friend. 
The interior had a clean, fresh feel with lots of seating. The service was sparkling and so fast!
The menu includes 16! different types of chicken salad which can be enjoyed alone, as a sandwich (cold or hot) or as a salad. 
We weren't super hungry, so we shared one meal. We chose the Popper Scoop (jalapeños, cream cheese, and bacon added) which was yummy! It came with a choice of side; we chose the quinoa salad. The flavors were perfectly balanced. And to top it all off, a darling little banana pudding parfait. Perfect! 
Can't wait to return and try other flavors and combinations. And you absolutely have to \"chick\" it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Good spot to grab lunch.  Cool idea that you can try different scoops of chicken, pudding and crackers.  Good change of pace than a sandwich.  I liked the curry chicken the best.

Friendly staff.  Order, pay, sit and they bring your food. Lots of parking nearby."}
{"text":"Fun, unique concept with some tasty chicken salad! We all enjoy their traditional chicken salad. My husband prefers the unique flavors such as the popper, or southwest.  Both have a spicy kick!
The chicken salad is not chunky but more smooth.  Not a bad thing but just know that it's more like a spread.  Usually we get a 2 scoop plate and it's served with a side and some tasty pudding.
We've tried the slider sandwiches which are delicious as well. The only thing I have had here that wasn't great was the chicken noodle soup. Very average. Everything else was a 10! I hope they survive bc sometimes it's a bit empty. Love he concept."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot with a large selection of chicken salad flavors and various options for pairing (sandwiches, wraps, on salads, etc). For first timers the menu can be a bit overwhelming but the staff will explain and offer samples to help you decide. I had the Cobb salad with avocado and Chipotle chicken salad. It was fantastic and serving size was large. The staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"I was in today and believe it was their first day open to the public.  The decor is a modern farmhouse vibe and very well done.  All of their printed materials such as the menus are very nice as well.

They basically have a bunch of different flavors of chicken salad that you can get served in different ways such as just a scoop, with salad or a sandwich.  I had the double scoop and chose the curry and thai spicy as my flavors.  They were both very good.

I like that they also give you a free small cup of pudding with your meal.  I think this place will do well."}
{"text":"A fun twist on regular old chicken salad. Great spot and prices are great for lunch. The double scoop was even a little too much food for lunch! Great find"}
{"text":"Awesome experience! Perfect portion size, very unique food. Quick service for lunch and very modern yet home like inside."}
{"text":"I remember hearing about The Chicken Scoop when they first opened and thinking it sounded like somewhere I would like.  Unfortunately, I didn't make it there for quite some time as it's \"geographically undesirable\" for me -- it's just out of the way from where I live, work, and typically play.  That is -- until this past Saturday when my kids had soccer games at Thunderbird park and we had a break in between their games mid-day.  

I headed over to pick up lunch to-go for me, my husband, my mother-in-law and father-in-law... I chose 4 different chicken salad wraps (Original, Veggie Dip, Sweet Berry, and the Southern).  It was hard to choose from the list of very unique flavors... I went with chips as the side for all to make it easy... we were eating at the park after all.

It did take a little while longer to get the food than anticipated, but service was pleasant, the restaurant was clean, prices were moderate, and most importantly, all of us were pleased with the food.  The wrap filled me up for hours!

If I lived closer, I don't know that I'd visit often, but I won't hesitate to return next time a chicken salad craving hits and/or if I find myself in the neighborhood again anytime soon.  I definitely am curious to try some of the other flavors and sides... hope to be even more adventurous next visit.

Pro-tip: this place also serves a decent looking breakfast!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've been.  Super fresh food, I got a scoop of BBQ and a scoop of spicy Thai chili.  My husband got pesto and curry scoops.  They come with a mini custard which is SO GOOD.  I'd come here every day but I'm on vacation and leaving soon.  We will be back tomorrow for sure before we leave!"}
{"text":"Went to The Chicken Scoop today after hubs raved about it. He was right (as always ). I got the Southern & the Berry. Being a Southern Belle myself, I know a good chicken salad when I taste it - and hunny, this chicken salad will make your tongue flog your chin just to get another bite!! The Quinoa Black-Eyed Pea salad was tasty. I tried a bite of hubby's Thai - too spicy to suit my taste! But he likes it, so we were both happy. The tiny shots of 'Naner Puddin' were an unexpected - and delicious addition. Just like Sunday dinner in the South. Y'all come back now, ya'hear?!"}
{"text":"Visited here with family, was going to try the croissant toasted, because it seemed to be missing that on the last visit. Unfortunately this particular visit the were out of a lot of items! They had no croissants, no slider rolls, and no fruit salad and several varieties of chips.. how frustrating.

I just don't understand how the restaurant could be out of all these things and not come up with a solution. In addition, my mother-in-law ordered her sandwich toasted and they forgot to do that. 

The first impression of this place is much better than recent impressions.. I think it's time to find a new lunch spot."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! So clean, fast service and such a great value for what you get. Not only do you get the two scoops of your flavor of chicken salad. But they give you a side AND DESSERT! I always love stopping by here when I'm in the area. But I love chicken salad to begin with."}
{"text":"Came across this gem a couple of weeks ago. It's a great lunch spot! It's clean & spacious with lots of chicken salad options. You would think chicken salad wouldn't be able to support an entire restarant, but I think this will work! The southern charm starts with the decor and ends with the perfect banana pudding shot that comes with your meal."}
{"text":"As a person with Celiac disease, my options for dining out tend to be a bit limited, so I was thrilled to find Chicken Scoop, which boasts a mostly gluten free selection of chicken salads, which is as you might guess from the name of the restaurant the focus of the menu.  I was a little less thrilled to learn that to get gluten free crackers with your chicken scoop was an upcharge, and to get a gluten free dessert was also an upcharge.  So you end up paying about an extra 50% on a standard one scoop meal for gluten free.  On top of that, they were out of one side and one dessert!  So the service experience and pricing were a little less than stellar.  The counter staff were very friendly, and the food was great (the gf crackers were surprisingly good, as was the gf blonde for dessert), so as long as you don't mind paying for 1.5x meals to not get sick from their food, this is a pretty good choice!"}
{"text":"So I was wandering the promenade with an empty stomach, decided to step in for a quick lunch. The lady up front was very kind and let me know if I wanted to sample anything, she would make it happen. I got the buffalo chicken melted scoop which was absolutely delicious. The bread was grilled so perfect and buttery. The bits of cheese on the edges were heaven. The lady at the cash told me it comes with a pudding, I chose banana. It was also amazing!  I got the broccoli slaw on the side as well. It was so tasty except for one thing. I was shocked to find raisins in it, why ruin a delicious creamy slaw with raisins. Raisins don't belong in any kind of slaw!  That's why I deducted a star."}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is absolutely fresh and delicious. I leave full every time. 

I have visited only a couple times and have always ordered the two scoop entree. It's perfect for me to share with my toddler. You can't go wrong with the \"original\" flavor but I'll be exploring other options next time."}
{"text":"Love this place, only wish I could give it more than 5 stars! Great option for a healthy lunch or dinner. The jalapeño popper chicken salad is my personal favorite, but I like to mix it up. I always grab a pound in the to-go section. Very nicely decorated, great place for a lunch meeting or place to grab a bite to eat with a friend."}
{"text":"I love chicken salad! And y'all rock it! Can't wait to come back and try them all !! I took my food to go- but the atmosphere was very cute. And the best part was my 15 year old son loved it too !!"}
{"text":"Super cute place. The people were friendly. Food was good. We tried a lot of different flavors the favorites were the popper and chipotle. My daughter loved the banana pudding."}
{"text":"I had ordered this from Uber Eats during lunch one day when I desperately wanted soup. This was my first experience using the food delivery app and it was pretty neat how it all worked together. The wait wasn't too long during lunch which is surprising. 

I ordered the original chicken salad sandwich on a croissant along with the chicken noodle soup. The sandwich was pretty good although I expected a little more flavor from a restaurant that relies on their chicken salad. The soup was kind of cold which I wouldn't make points off due to the fact that I ordered from a food delivery app. Flavoring was just okay on the soup as well. It was very fresh tasting with their ingredients but the broth left a bit to be desired.

I think I will try this place again in the future however I would rather dine in this time. Perhaps this will change my opinion a bit since this restaurant seems to get really great reviews otherwise."}
{"text":"Having some Chipotle scoop here, not crazy about the taste, the mixed fruit side is just grapes With mushy strawberries...  not too crazy about the place"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend who raved about the chicken salad, I knew it had to go on my list of go to places. I'm glad I did! They have an interesting menu of different chicken salads to try. I decided boringly enough to go with the regular chicken salad with the loaded potato salad and for dessert a lovely bite of banana pudding.Hubby went with the shredded chicken and cheese (firebird sandwich) with a side of broccoli slaw.
The chicken scoop is inviting and clean, the food is fresh and very tasty and the staff is friendly. Try it for lunch or dinner! This may have been our first visit but not our last."}
{"text":"First time here. Very nice, spacious and lovely decoration. Th salad is good as well. Service is great. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I stopped by on my lunch break excited to try something new. The location is convenient and the interior is pleasant. I love chicken salad but I'm not a food adventurer so I stuck with the basics on my first visit. I found the original to be extremely bland. The consistently was mushy. I expected to taste dill, salt, pepper and celery as traditionally found in chicken salad. What I ended up with was overly mayo based mush between two pieces of bread. If home style chicken salad was what they were going for I think they missed the mark. I am not likely to return."}
{"text":"The Chicken Scoop is certainly a delightful place. The atmosphere is inviting and modern. Tastefully decorated and clean. Now about the food. I ordered the three scoops (the popper, pesto and southern) with a side of potato salad. All of these were scrumptious and delicious. The potato salad was rich and creamy. I took my order home and added the chicken scoop to some tomatoes and cucumbers I had available. This certainly added flavor to the vegetables. Then, I also had some pasta cooked and added what's left of the pesto chicken. That was a delicious pasta salad. Normally, I would just eat the chicken salad on its own but needed to use up what I had in the refrigerator. 
The customer service was spectacular.  I wish I could recall the name of the young woman as I tried to remember but she allowed me to try some samples before I made my decisions. Also told me which flavors she enjoyed but that I couldn't go wrong with any of them. This was a nice treat. Also, there was a small desert added. I believe a banana flavored pudding or custard. 
The food was packaged nicely with plenty of crackers and and added surprise. An extra scoop of the original flavor. This was also delicious.
I've read other comments about this restaurant won't be around a year but these people must not be supportive of local non chain places. It's a nice treat to have an option different from hamburgers, sandwiches or expensive plates that are in the area. I will certainly frequent this place again and look to trying more options."}
{"text":"Chicken Scoop!  I love you!  I had the Caesar and it was so tasty and done perfectly.  I am going to come back and try more.  Yes it's just chicken salad but there are many option of sandwiches, salads and sides.  Great option if you're watching carbs."}
{"text":"Soooo good! Had the Chipotle and Pesto scoops with the Black Eyed Pea salad. Can't wait to try the rest of the flavors. Now they just need to open a location in Tempe =)"}
{"text":"I am pretty religious about bringing my lunch to work but if I worked closer to the chicken scoop I'd come here all the damn time. Reasonably priced and delicious. The southwest toastie is the bees knees!"}
{"text":"This is such an amazing place! I went today for lunch with my mom. Both of us wanted something light and healthy and this is exactly what we were looking for! They had so many options for chicken salad and I have a feeling none of them are disappointing. I got the garden salad with the sweet berry chicken salad and my mom got the same! We will be back and try something new next time!"}
{"text":"This is the 4th time I have been here and every time has been exceptional! The food is always so fresh and delicious... tonight I tried the chipotle chicken salad and the barbecue. They're loaded potato salad is amazing! The restaurant is always clean and everyone is so friendly."}
{"text":"Place is different than most quick service places that I've visited, which is refreshing. Service is super friendly and the food is good. Nice to have a change of pace and options for a low carb diet. Tried the original scoop and will be back to get a little more adventurous."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant for a quick lunch. They have great options for different types of chicken salad.  My favorite side is the potato salad, which goes well with the southern chicken salad. And, the banana pudding is excellent!"}
{"text":"What a cool spot! So many options which was a little overwhelming but the regular chicken salad was good, and potato salad amazing! The wait time for our food was a little long, definitely would be hard to eat quick on a lunch break."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write my review on The Chicken Scoop forever! I first came here when they opened in the summer... I will be honest, I wasn't expecting much, I thought what can you do with Chicken Salad? Well apparently you can do quite a lot ! 
Service has always been super friendly, fast and efficient. They will let you try samples of their many flavors if you can't decide ( personally I am obsessed with The Curry)... You can get a scoop meal with crackers and a side ( their broccoli slaw is to die for) or you can go for a scoop on a salad or do a sammie! They even make some great toasties for those who aren't huge fans of chicken salad (I wasn't until I tried their chicken salads, now I am a chicken salad believer!)

Great Lunch Spot and its a family run locally owned business!"}
{"text":"The menu is a little confusing at first because of so many choices.  The food was good and the scoops of chicken salad on top of the garden salad with banana pudding were just enough for lunch.

Try it."}
{"text":"The family stopped in on a whim not knowing they just opened up recently. Food was great, service was quick and love the little puddings with every meal. Love this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried the chicken scoop. We didn't get to eat our food right away and it was still pretty rockstar status. I would have taken pics if we hadnt waited so long to eat. 

I got the beef and cheddar with a load potato salad side and strawberry pudding. Portion sizes were sharable. 

My friend went to pick up our food, she said that it was a little difficult to find because its tucked in the shopping center.

I will try their chicken salad next time."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch! There is never a line and food is always ready for pick up. I eat here once or twice a week and I get the same thing every time. A Garden Scoop with the garden salad and veggie/southern scoops. Lately, I have been extremely disappointed with the quality of the salad. I have given it 3 or 4 chances but end up always throwing away the lettuce and eating the chicken salad. Its limp, slimy and mostly all browning romaine hearts. As much as I love this place, do not get the salad! In addition to that, this place isn't really all that busy. The management here is always sitting at a table in their dining area either on their phone or computer. Some more interaction with the customers might bring more business. Just some food for thought. :)"}
{"text":"The chicken scoop offers 14 different varieties of chicken salad, yes you read that correctly.
Let's take a moment to marvel at the genius of this concept. 
Take scoops of chicken paired with a side of greens/soup served with a scoop of pudding, crackers and what you have is the perfect combo.

~the double scoop $8.69.
the southern-chopped eggs, mustard, sweet pickle relish
the sweet berry-cranberries and pecan
broccoli slaw-shredded broccoli, carrots mixed with raisins in a sweet dressing
a scoop of banana pudding
~the scoopwich $8.29
 a scoop of the original chicken salad-mayo, minced celery, seasoning with lettuce and tomato served on nine-grain bread
loaded potato salad-baby red potatoes, sour cream, bacon, cheddar, chives
a scoop of chocolate pudding

The scoops of southern,sweet berry and original were all delicious as were the samples of southwest,waldorf,pesto and spicy thai.I loved the broccoli slaw it had a sweet taste definitely try that.The potato salad was also nice.
I wasn't a big fan of the pudding especially the chocolate i thought it tasted funny.

Definitely going back  to try the Curry chicken salad which they had run of out the last time.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I highly highly recommend this place. Such great homemade food.  Daily soups and chicken salad so many different ways I didn't even know existed.  Delicious desserts and egg salad too.  Seriously delicious.  That vanilla run pudding with the homemade whipped cream and graham cracker bottom was insane."}
{"text":"Great variety of choices and flavors, I had the chipotle and it delivered on flavor.  Husband got the original and said it was a bit plain yet good. We both got the Scoopwich on a croissant came with a side a cute little banana pudding."}
{"text":"I've found my new favorite lunch spot!  This is the best chicken salad that I have ever eaten! There are so many choices too.  The staff is extremely friendly & offered me samples to try as I couldn't make up my mind.  I ordered 3 different chicken salads (BBQ, Southern & Chipotle) & LOVED all 3.  I can't wait to try the sandwiches too.  Great interior & staff!"}
{"text":"Hungry in North Scottsdale and thrown for a loop?
Maybe your favorite place to eat has flown the coop?
It couldn't hurt to check out The Chicken Scoop
Whether you are eating alone or with a group
Everyone will find it's a hoot
As for the menu, there are multiple chicken salad options, some of them with fruit.

I had the Southwest and spicy Thai chicken scoop
It was a generous portion, served with crackers and a cup of pudding which was tiny and cute.
The food was pretty good, the price around $10 to boot.
Tables and chairs are plenty and comfortable, no need to stoop.

With so many positive reviews, it's only natural that your patronage should follow suit!"}
{"text":"Here's the scoop... 2 scoops is the way to go!! I had the Thai and Chipotle and both were delicious!  My normal go to would be a sandwich but I branched out and I'm so glad I did- you can really taste all the flavors of your desired scoop and the crunch and salty butteriness from the cracker are the perfect combination.  There are so many great flavors to choose from that I will definitely be back to try them all."}
{"text":"Mmm mmm mmmmmm! Went here for lunch - late lunch. Not a soul in sight. 

Tried the Thai chicken salad with crackers - delish.

Next time I would get it on a salad or croissant. Was a little odd to just eat the salad with plastic wrapped crackers you get with soup at Fry's.

But nonetheless, the choices were hard for an indecisive person because they all sounded yummy....and the one I chose was a good one and the price was right."}
{"text":"I ordered the Turkey Jack sandwich and it was delicious!  They are good size portions too because you get the sandwich plus a side and a dessert.  I've been here twice now and felt full & happy.  The inside is nice too.  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Needed to grab a quick lunch while at work. Wasn't sure how this place would be but it turned out really good! I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a really great place to come and grab a quick and healthy meal.  Perfect for on the go or dine in.  Great selection with 14 choices of chicken salad.   Just awesome."}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch with a friend. We both enjoyed our meal.  My friend especially because her lunch came with banana pudding with a vanilla wafer!  We'll be back. Very courteous and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Me and my girlfriend hit it after the gym.  So many delicious varieties of chicken and we enjoy trying them all.  Great quality chicken meat.  I am super picky about my chicken and won't eat cheap meat or dark meat, this meat is perfect every time we go in.  Plan on making it a weekly stop.  We get the trio so we have leftovers next day for lunch.  I slap it on bread at home."}
{"text":"We went here on a Groupon deal and I'm so glad I did. It's such an inviting, spacious casual eating venue that is very clean.  You order at the counter from their wide selection of chicken scoops and it's brought to your table.  I must say the server (hes a slim male with a bit of a facial hair) who took our order made our experience so positive with friendly interactions and even told us not to worry about the few cents the Groupon didn't cover. Even if the food wasn't great, I would have come back because the service is so nice. Amazing job on staff training or just lucky find with a great employee. We got our food, which we ordered 4 types of scoops (Thai, southwestern, Caesar, pesto) and they were all very flavorful and delicious. You can order it with a side, on a salad or in a sandwich. They even give you crackers you can sandwich your chicken in between which was so good. Each meal comes with a cute little shot glass size pudding which was a perfect sweet note to end a meal.  All in all its a great casual place to grab a quick meal and I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I do not like mayonnaise or cream cheese based salads at all and was hoping Chicken Scoop would have other kinds of salads - and they do!  My green salad was very good, with balsamic dressing and shredded chicken added.  Really good lunch, really nice staff, and very clean restaurant.  I have to admit I didn't like the pudding because it is as bland as hospital food and would actually ask them to leave it off my tray next time.  And I am a dessert fiend, but what's the point of eating something that's bad for you if it's mediocre?

My dining partner had a chicken salad sandwich.  He loved the salad itself, but didn't like the bread which he said was just boring, so would stick to the chicken salad scoops next time."}
{"text":"What a fun concept. The food was great and freaking on a hot day. My only complaint would be that the kids grilled cheese didn't taste very good. Not sure if it was the butter that was used or what. Other than that we had a lot of flavors. My favorite was the BBQ flavor. I would also love it if it was served with ritz crackers."}
{"text":"Fabulous!!! From the super cute, inviting decor to the delicious food - you need to do yourself a favor and come here!! {perfect fuel after shopping! }  I tried the classic and the Waldorf - but all the flavors sounded divine. The meals include a side and a super cute mini desert. Also, for the price you get so much! 

Try it... love it... you'll be addicted too!"}
{"text":"Clean pretty good and different staff was sweet and quick . I had the chipotle and bbq with salad and s'mores pudding I will be back to try more that's for sure"}
{"text":"The salad was fresh and the chicken salad scoop with berries was absolutely delicious. I will absolutely go back again."}
{"text":"Walked in for the 1st time, not knowing what to expect. I like chicken salad, but the options here are ridiculously amazing!! The general manager, Chad, came to personally greet me and walked me through the menu. He was very personable and friendly. When,i told him I'd never been here.. He talked even more! And even offered samples! I got the 1 scoop Pesto chicken. WOW! It comes with the scoop, crackers and your choice of a side. I opted for a salad and fell more in love!! I usually like my chicken salad a little chunky. This is NOT. BUT it didn't matter. It was light, fluffy, and AMAZING!! Each meal comes with a single shot scoop of vanilla pudding... I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe no one has thought of this concept before - GENIUS. This place is so amazing! I could eat here everyday (and I have for the last 3 days no joke)! Super cute ambience and super delicious food! I keep meaning to try more flavors but I'm stuck on the Buffalo chicken right now. The little puddings are darling and so good! I'll be back tomorrow.."}
{"text":"Really interesting concept. 14 types of chicken salad. Tried the Chicken Scoop for lunch today with a buddy of mine. Ordered the Melted Scoop with BBQ chicken salad and pepper jack cheese on sourdough bread with chips and a drink. I'll be upfront and say that I'm not a huge fan of chicken salad but the sandwich I had I really enjoyed and would order it again on a repeat visit. They also had a nice dining room; an easy to understand menu and an attentive staff. Check it out at your earliest convenience if you're up in North Scottsdale and if you love chicken salad, then look no further because this will be your spot!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots (although it seems a little quiet at night).   They have a large selection of chicken salads with different treatments ranging from plain salad with mayo to a gently spiced curry one, which is my favorite.  

They also offer a soup of the day and I think a grilled cheese.  What I do like is you can buy the salad as a scoop or multiples, have it on its own, in a sandwich or as part of a salad.  That one lets you pick your side and comes with a sweet little cup of pudding too.  They also are generous with the crackers.  

There can be a bit of a wait of 5 - 7 mins from ordering at lunchtime, but at least you know it's being assembled to order.

Enjoy....."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a 3 scoop plate BBQ,original,buffalo I come in often they are my go to I have tried almost all of them however today the BBQ tasted funny so I didn't eat all of it I have horrible food poisoning the past few days have been hell I will never return"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful!!! Love eating here, I have tried all of the scoop flavors and have enjoyed everyone of them. There is a Groupon for them right now, so check it out!! Oh and the banana pudding!!!"}
{"text":"MEH. I agree with one of the other reviewers. This place won't be around a year from now. It's an interesting concept, but I won't be going back anytime soon. 

I ordered the two scoop, Curry and Spicy Thai. The Curry was good enough, but nothing special. The Spicy Thai wasn't spicy at all. My partner ordered the traditional and even he said it needed \"more kick\" and he's very forgiving.

Spend your hard-earned money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great little lunch place found to mix up the regularity of all of the places from which my coworkers and I regularly order/dine. Might be a little hard to find if you're not familiar with the Promenade area, but it's in the same building/parking area as The Habit Burger. First thing I noticed was how cute and adorable the interior is, reminiscent of a bright southern house & kitchen.

Great variety of chicken scoop flavors! I made sure to check the menu out beforehand so I knew what to expect. Being a little hungry I decided to go with the 2-scoop combo, and my coworker went with a 1-scoop and salad. If you're unsure which flavor to order, they'll give you a sample. I went with the pesto (mayo-free) and original scoops. Both a little plain, but fairly flavorful, lots of chicken (more than I expected). The side option I selected was black eyed pea/quinoa salad which was better than I expected! Has a bit of a spicy kick at the end of each bite, but not much. Wish I had more room for more of that salad! Each meal comes with a shooter of pudding, both us of selected the pumpkin (seasonal) and wanted more! 

TL DR:: SO. MUCH. PROTEIN. SO. FILLING. Next time my coworker and I are going to share a 3-scoop meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Unique and delicious. I got the Waldorf chicken salad scoop and my bf got the melted scoop with the popper chicken salad. Both were delicious. The chocolate peanut butter pudding was also bombbbb. One of my new fav places to go"}
{"text":"Service: I ordered through Uber Eats, and for some reason the food was 'being prepared' for 45 minutes.  I ordered the triple scoop, isn't that all pre-made?  Anyway, food arrives and they forgot to include the banana pudding that was a 'required' selection in the app. 

Food: The loaded potato salad was pretty good.  The chicken salad was not - and I am normally a HUGE fan of chicken salad.  I had 3 different varieties, and each of them had a weird sticky/pasty consistency.  Might be the way the prepare the chicken? It's finely shredded instead of cubed or chunked.  There was also a perfumey aftertaste that I couldn't figure out.  Anyway, had 2 bites of each and threw the rest away. 

Supermarket deli is way better than this, and that isn't saying much."}
{"text":"Exceeded my expectations. Great place for dine in or take-out. Portions are large. Decor is very nice and clean.

There is a large variety on the menu. You can  sample to try before you choose. Prices are very reasonable.

I have enjoyed the Popper, the Buffalo and the Chipotle. The broccoli side was yummy and the pudding was a nice touch.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Let's get this straight; I'm not big on chicken salad and dislike the idea of single offering restaurants. But this place blew me away. The various chicken salads actually taste the ways they are described and are good. The sides are fresh and the salad dressings are outstanding. I would quibble with the choice of crackers, too small to hold a nice bite of the key ingredient. While we were not overwhelmed by the small cups of pudding that came with each meal, the idea is lovely and I would guess most people will like the sweetness. Service is casual dining but friendly. The place is pleasant, clean, and quiet. The prices are very reasonable. I say this was a happy free range meal."}
{"text":"Delicious! I am obsessed with chicken salad so when I found out this place was opening I was beyond excited! Tried the buffalo chicken salad with the black eyed pea side and both were amazing! They even give you a mini banana pudding with every meal and that was good too!! Very good for what you pay! Can't wait to go back and try another flavor! Very cute and clean inside! Will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I tried a melt with the southwest chicken and it was delicious.  The space is open and clean, and there are nice comfortable booths, which is a must for me at any restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a long time but was never in the area and it didn't seem worth it to drive out there only to try it... so when I saw it pop up on uber eats, I decided it was time. That being said, I'm rating this purely on the food and not on the total atmosphere. 

I really liked whole concept of different kids of chicken salad, so I went with the three scoop meal. I got the BBQ, the original, and the waldorf, went with fruit for my side and the Oreo pudding. It comes with crackers too. 

The chicken salads were good, but nothing really jumped out as special for me. They had slight flavor variations but it was all kind of the same to me. The crackers you get are prepackaged basic crackers. The fruit was a combo of grapes, melon and strawberries, it was okay.  The pudding was pretty tasty and a nice treat at the end of the meal. 

Overall, it was good but I wasn't blown away. If you are really into chicken salad I would check this place out, but I'm not sure I'll be returning or ordering again."}
{"text":"Tried a three scoop, 2 of which are very good, but 1 of them (curry) seems too dry.  Over all a good place with fast, healthy options.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Very unique restaurant. Friendly service and you can't go wrong with any of the chicken salads as everything is made super fresh. The crackers are kinda boring though. Prices are in line with the high quality of the products offered. I wish them much success. I suspect their lunch time is super busy as there was not one soul other than us one evening but then again we were there near closing time."}
{"text":"Didnt even know this place was here!!  Very clean and atmosphere is relaxing....Delicous sandwhiches and potato salad! Staff is very friendly and accommodating! Portion sizes are  perfect and price is reasonable with what you get! I highly recommend this place and i will be back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a very unique concept. They feature more than a dozen chicken salad scoop mixtures. You choose one or more for a salad, sandwich, wrap or by itself. I tried the curry on a sandwich, and it was delicious. With every meal, they also include a mini dessert parfait. I tried the banana and graham cracker, and it was yummy. I noticed they also had a kids menu with PBJ or grilled cheese. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this opening. I went this past Wednesday. They had been open 6 days. I had the original on a croissant. Mostly because it was first on the list.  I had planned to love it and go back and go down the list and eventually try all of them. I will not return to eat glorified cat food. The chicken salad was bland and dry. No taste. It is not chunks of chicken like most you find- even at Arby's. It is food processed with the ingredients from whichever flavor they're making. Ick. It's like a spread. Not chunky at all. The black eyed pea salad was ok. The pudding cup is why it got one star. But you don't know if it is vanilla or banana or....what. Before I wrote this review I figured I'd try another flavor.  I took my mom to try it today. She loves chicken salad. She had the Thai and the Waldorf. I had the Thai. Same complaint. She said it was less than \"meh\". I had the broccoli slaw. It was ok. Other issues were that the metal plate they serve it in slides around the table. It almost went flying. The other thing was that the water tastes really odd. I added lemon. Didn't help. It's either the water or the ice. Please check it out. I tossed my cup. Couldn't drink it. If you're looking for some good chicken salad, try Butters. It was so much better.

Also, very disappointed in the business reply being filled with ads for the store. My Yelp privacy settings have business replies blocked. How were they able to post a reply? I will be reporting this to Yelp."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and I love the concept! The place offers 14 different flavors of chicken salad with awesome sides. I had the curry on a croissant and it was delicious. The broccoli slaw is ridiculously good. I don't mind eating vegetables that taste this great! The shot glass of banana pudding was the perfect finish to the meal. The fact that every meal comes with a dessert is top notch in my book!

I'm visiting from Texas and wish this place would franchise and open one right by my house!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you love chicken salad this place is a must for you to try! Today I tried a toasted scoopwich with their buffalo chicken salad and loved every bite! Oh and the banana pudding was delicious as well! The place is beautifully decorated and the staff was so friendly and informative. I would recommend this place to anyone! Thanks for the awesome experience and amazing food Chicken Scoop!"}
{"text":"Look, it's fine, fine chicken salad. But I can't imagine this place will be open a year from now. Chicken salad just isn't interesting or sexy enough to sustain a whole restaurant concept. 

I got the sampler to try a few flavors with the Popper (jalapeño, cream cheese, bacon & cheddar), Waldorf (apples, grapes & walnuts), & Curry (raisins, almonds & curry seasoning). The best was the Popper for its zippy flavor. But, honestly, if you're craving Mexican flavors, you're better off going somewhere where you can order a taco or enchilada. All three salads were made with shredded chicken (not chunks) and therefore were too mushy for my taste. 

If you're gluten-free like me, all of the many varieties of chicken salad are gluten-free. They don't have any gf bread but you can pay a whopping $1.25 extra for gf crackers (which were good). You can ask for a banana pudding without the cookie but be forewarned that it'll come served atop a graham cracker crust. (All meals come with a wee banana pudding dessert, which was delicious, by the way.)

Lovely, clean modern decor with a farmhouse accent. Very friendly service.

I'm leaving hungry because I've run out of crackers & there's just so much chicken salad I can eat in one sitting. If I come back, I'll get one scoop & try their soup or one of their green salads."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Chicken Scoop was a very positive one. We ordered the Chopped Salad and the Poppy Seed salad. We tried the curry scoop and the Waldorf scoop, both very good. We will be returning to try the Buffalo scoop and some sides. Very clean. Staff was very nice to us first timers who had no idea how the menus worked. The best thing is that most things, including the chicken salads are Gluten Free!"}
{"text":"How refreshing! A restaurant with a unique idea that looks appealing and tastes delightful. They have created imaginative ways to serve chicken salad and it is so good you don't even need or want bread. I had the spicy Thai and the curry scoops- you can choose from single, double, or triple scoops. It is served with a side of salad- a broccoli salad or a black eyed peas salad - which I chose. And just to make it the perfect lunch they serve a little shot glass of pudding on the side. Their menu offers melts and salads which I may get to next time, but they have so many choices of chicken salad that it may be a toss up. The decor is adorable and service was prompt. I may become a regular."}
{"text":"First time. Great menu, super friendly service, tasty chicken salad. Mostly noticed how clean the restaurant was. Tables being cleaned moments after customers left. Will definitely return when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Chicken Salad with a Twist.

First time here, good size restaurant nicely decorated and the worker came to us and helped us with our order.

Had a double scoop with the southern and curry with the loaded potato salad. The southern is chopped eggs, mustard with sweet pickle relish and the curry has almonds, raisins with curry seasoning. With the curry, the raisins and almonds were a little too much.

Loaded Potato Salad has bacon, cheese and chives in a scoop size which was excellent. I am a potato salad person and this was a pleasant surprise. 

Scoops are placed on lettuce so if you choose you can use it as a lettuce wrap and there are crackers available on the table or just eat the salad by itself.

Would recommend ordering the 2 scoop because it includes a side which is really a 3rd scoop. The 3 scoop does not include a side dish so you end up paying about a dollar more for nothing.

We ordered a 2 scoop, a 3 scoop and the Caprese Sandwich which were all tasty.

The bill for the 3 of us without any drinks were around $29.

Personally thought spending  $29 for chicken salad was pricy,  but was a different alternative to burgers and pizza. 

Good concept wanted to try something different, cost is the major factor."}
{"text":"Cute place. The chicken salad was good. I got the curry and my husband got the BBQ. Both were good. So was the potato salad. I also  appreciate that they have gluten-free baked goods for sale. Service was slow and not great - it took over 20-25 min to get our food, which seems a little silly considering you know that it is all made up already. We also had to wait at the counter for 5 min for someone to even come and take our order. Also, the tea I wanted was empty, and despite me asking, they never refilled it. If the service had been better, I would have given this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Where has this place been all my life?! I love a good chicken salad but it's super hard to find a good one. I had lunch here today with a friend. I had the Cobb salad with the regular chicken salad scoop.  It was delicious. I would definitely return as there are so many choices. Nice atmosphere and clean restaurant.  Also, the banana pudding was delish!!!!"}
