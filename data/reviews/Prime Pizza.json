{"text":"Visited this restaurant while taking in some Spring Training in the area and based on the positive reviews listed here on Yelp. I was a little disappointed by the service and the mediocre fare.  First, I'll say that my visit was on a Saturday evening, and there seemed to be a large group occupying a number of the tables.  We were greeted by someone that appeared to be the owner and pointed in a direction toward a table. Several of the wait staff passed by our table over the next 15 mins or so until the owner came by again and asked if we had been taken care of yet. We told him \"no\" and he replied that he would send someone over. A female server was speaking to another table when one of the other guests pointed out to her that we had not been helped yet, so she came over and took our drink order which consisted only of sodas and water. That was the last we saw of her for another 15 mins or so until she returned with the drinks and told we could have some more time to decide on our order as she walked away.  We we mildly entertained by a live duo playing music that seemed a little too loud for the smallish venue. At one point, each of the players were sound-checking themselves throughout the restaurant and the management then asked if they could turn the volume down a little.  The place was beginning to thin out and we had not had our order taken  yet. The owner again passed the table and asked if we were taken care of and then apologized saying that we would soon be \"back on track\". Our server returned to take our order of spaghetti, lasagna and a meatball plate with some garlic bread to start as an appetizer, which we thought might be some fairly easily prepared dishes that might speed up our wait time.  We were wrong. After a long delay, our garlic bread arrived along with a few plates and a stack of utensils which our server quickly left and again departed.  More time passed and we finally received our main course which I can say was \"okay\" at best. A little bland, and none of us finished all of the food on our plates. Honestly, because of the very good reviews listed here on Yelp, I had anticipated a nice meal but can tell you that we left disappointed.   Service was sparse, food was ok but we will likely not be visiting this establishment again."}
{"text":"Best pizza that we've had in a long time! Prime pizza brought the excitement back in pizza night. We went there this past Sunday to watch the game and are so happy we did. They have great thin crust pizza. We are going back for seconds tonight."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant on a whim and am I ever glad we did. It's set right in front of Polar Ice skating rink by the Peoria Sports complex and is easy to miss. But don't drive right on by. You'll be missing some of the best thin crust pizza in the Valley. I love green olives on my pizza and few to no places in the Valley offer them. But this restaurant does!!! The crust was crispy without being over done and the toppings were tasty. Our server was very attentive and friendly without being overbearing. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The very BEST pizza and lasagna I have had. The ambience is great and Tony Cort owner and Fabio chef make you  welcome. Dont hesitate to come and enjoy the best Italian food you ever had."}
{"text":"We ordered the pasta and the sauce is to die for - like my Italian grandmother used to make!    The dessert of the day was creme brulee - my favorite and it did not disappoint.  The atmosphere is great and servers are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Peoria needs more places like this.  It is tucked away on 83rd Avenue next to the Peoria Sports Complex.  As many of you West Valley kids know, it is difficult to find truly local spots on this side of town- sometimes even I have to settle for Red Robin when dining on that side of the Valley.  So, Prime Pizza breathes some nice, local fresh air into this area of town.  They offer basic appetizers (several types of bruschetta), salads, pasta and pizzas.  They also have happy hour specials from 4-7!  The happy hour include a select few food items and $2 off draft and house wines.    We did a make your own pizza and spaghetti with garlic bread.  I have to be honest and say that I've grown to love whole wheat noodles so regular noodles taste too intense for me these days.  The marinara sauce in the spaghetti was great, though.  The pizza was saucy and cheesy- a bit tough on the very bottom of the crust but otherwise tasty.  Our server was super friendly, and one of the co-owners even came over to chat with us.  He reigns from Chicago, but I wouldn't call this a Chicago pizzeria.    If you're looking for a cute and unique restaurant in Peoria, I'd say you should stop into Prime Pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and I've always had great service. The food is excellent and the atmosphere is great.  I like that you can go here casually or even on  a date. The pizza is good, but not the best. Their appetizers are really good and they have a pretty extensive list of wines and alcohols."}
{"text":"This place was a decent choice for the Arrowhead area.  Wasn't a chain with a modern/contemporary look offering a decent food menu.  However, the problem with this restaurant was the location, not very visible from the road and not near any other restauarants and bars.  I'm sure this is the reason that the place is now closed.  Good idea, just the wrong spot for the area."}
{"text":"This place is a bit hidden.  I went here to meet friends on a Monday night.  They had karaoke and even though it was late a night (9pm) there were little kids.  One was actually a really good singer.  The service was decent, and the buidling appears pretty new and although the interior is a bit cozy, there is a huge wrap around outdoor patio with acces to the bar.  The pizza we ordered was thin, greasy and really cheesy- brooklyn style.  Very delicious."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with my son a few weeks ago. We were the only people in there, but then again it was a Thursday at 8:30pm. We both ordered the \"Italian\" and were very pleased. nice touch serving it on a baguette instead of the tradition hero breads. One thing could be improved. Potato chips as a side? Come on, figure out something else. There were several employee's eating a pizza at the counter. It looked good and we plan on returning to try their pizza's soon."}
