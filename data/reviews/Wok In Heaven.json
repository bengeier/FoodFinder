{"text":"We are so lucky to have Wok in Heaven as our local Chinese restaurant.  Every dish we've had has been fresh and flavorful. I typically order the Hunan Pork (extra spicy), and the family loves the General Tso's chicken, chicken 'n broccoli, and beef 'n broccoli.  The only thing I'm not crazy about are the egg rolls.  It's a bonus that they deliver locally too.  All in all, Wok in Heaven is spectacular."}
{"text":"Way Overpriced for what you get. It's amazing to me that pittsburgh has no good Chinese places. The $13 entrees are a joke! The Generals chicken was devoid of flavor and portions were light. The dishes here would be $6 if they were in Philadelphia. Pittsburgh is just devoid of flavor. If one travels they would understand. Oh, of course there were no chop sticks, fork or napkins in my to-go order. I had to ask and got a dirty look from the lady behind the desk. A truly fine example of Asian cheapness."}
{"text":"Wow and I am saying WOW! I'm sorry but the wok in heaven with the old owners was and I mean the best but now its a tragedy ... Food is bland either under or over cooked rice taste like ( no words had to use the emoji) they say they also offer delivery but never have some one to deliver please bring back the old owners their legacies are at stake."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem on the edge of Plum-Penn Hills.  It is probably the best Chinese place in East Pittsburgh and possible the city.  The egg rolls although a tad greasy are delicious especially with hot mustard sauce.  The hot and sour soup is also some of the better I had.  The General Tso's is very solid, not the best I ever had, but some of the better in the city. Check this place out if you are out East."}
{"text":"IMHO this is the best bang for a buck for Chinese food in the Pittsburgh region. Wonton noodles are very tender, all broths are delicately seasoned and everything tastes wonderfully fresh. Not overly sweet or salted. Very small place, not fancy, and great takeout. I have had mostly soups, chicken dishes, egg rolls etc. Haven't tried seafood yet."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time this weekend. The food was hot, fresh and flavorful. Good portions for the price. Was ready for pick up quickly. Will certainly eat here more often!"}
{"text":"The food was OK, but nothing special, especially for the price. I ordered only for myself and I picked it up, and knowing how steep the prices were I was unpleasantly surprised with my food. Basically, to me it's not worth the cost. I won't be ordering from here again when there are so many other options in and around the area."}
{"text":"We love this place!  We couldn't believe we could find such good Chinese food in Plum!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this restaurant ever since it opened years ago. We were never a fan of the owner because we thought she was rude but we kept going back because we enjoyed the food. They just started a new thing that if you want to SPLIT and entree with another person you have to pay a $5 fee to do so. And if you are not going to order anything there's a $5 fee for the WATER and chips. I find this to be outrageous. When we confronted the owner about it, she was rude of course. Even after supporting the business for years. We are sad that they are doing this. I think this is going to have a huge effect on the amount of business they do. I would not recommend going here at all. Rude owner and poor service. I would give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Darn!  I so wanted to support a local Plum business but after trying 3 different entrees....they were ok at best.  2 of the dishes lacked any seasoning or flavor. Chicken was moist but the vegetables that are supposed to be in each dish were hard to find.  One of their specialties at over $13.00 wasn't very special.  I will say their ginger salad dressing was different and tasty.  I just don't think it's enough to get me back though.....darn it."}
{"text":"Great pepper steak - king pao chicken.  Love the wonton soup.  Order and it's usually ready in 20 minutes!"}
