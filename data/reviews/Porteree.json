{"text":"I would have given this place one star, but the food quality and price are deserving of a 3 or even 4 star.  

I am knocking this place down for its management.   A fire alarm was chirping the whole time, and the server felt unable to do anything about it (including suggesting or facilitating a table move).   They got my order wrong, and it came after about 25 minutes of waiting.   The excuse given for the delay was \"2 orders came ahead of yours, and we can't handle many orders at once\".

The positive:  they used nice cuts of fresh chicken, and the portion size was good.   There is a fireplace and TVs set to sports channels.

The bad:  the table legs are already bent so bad that every push of the fork shifted the table an inch.    There was no apology offered for getting the order wrong, and by the sounds of it, it happens a lot after hearing more details."}
{"text":"I have gotten delivery a couple times from here and it is always good. Ribs, wings, and chicken tikka are my faves. Had a really bad salad from here once so probably wouldn't do that again. Really overdressed and since it was delivery it was really soggy. Just threw it out. Delivery has been taking over an hour and food usually needs a little reheating but it's good so I am usually only angry about it until my first bite!"}
{"text":"Will be offering delivery soon, how cool is that!?

Indian and Italian food under one roof..."}
