{"text":"Fantastic - great food, very good service and huge, huge amounts! And yes, I agree french onion soup every time and lamb shanks if they've got it. My partner is all about the bread pudding - he always gains 2 waist sizes when we eat there!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere great and friendly staff, but the food was a dissappoinment, felt like a supermarket meal..."}
{"text":"Excellent service, reasonable prices (+/- $100 for two, 3 course meal, half litter wine and 1L of Perrier), depending on what you eat the food is average/good.
The ambiance is relaxed.
The restaurant is small with French memorabilia."}
{"text":"A group of four of us went to Bibiche for dinner on a Saturday night. We all enjoyed the very french menu with hints of quebecois and north african fare on the menu. I think the chef is from Quebec and he seems to know his way around the kitchen.

First thing to mention is the portion sizes. Ridiculously generous. In fact, if you have a moderate appetite I'd suggest splitting the main. Overall, salads and main dishes were all well enjoyed. 

Atmosphere is ok, small place, pretty simple decor. Service was very good. Priices were reasonable. Would go again."}
{"text":"If you plan to eat at Bibiche, bring extra undies.  The French onion soup here is going to make you cum in your pants.   Don't even feign listening as your dinner date drones on about how French onion soup is what granny orders when they go to Red Lobster.  That's happening on a different planet.  Just let your primitive mind take hold.  Let it sharpen your focus to the point where there is nothing.  Nothing but you and your astoundingly good soup.  

Forget the main course.  I know, your practical side is thinking that soup isn't much of a meal.  So get some appetizers.  There are some great and inventive salads here.  Eat them first.  Let's call them foreplay. After the soup, stop.  

You know how, after you've been really, really um..satiated, you don't like to rush right back into things?  It's the same thing at Bibiche.  After the soup you are going to just want to live in that perfect moment of pure satisfaction as long as you can.  And on a practical level, you really won't be hungry anymore anyways.  

So have another glass from the great wine selections available, and in a few minutes you'll catch up with the conversation.    \"Are you sure you've had enough?\" your date will ask.

\"Oh yes\", you'll reply, \"I'm done.  I'm done.\""}
