{"text":"Please do not come here! 
Management is disorganized and the place is so filthy!

Came today and they only had 2 servers - how do they expect it to not be a full house (which it was) during Eurocup? And on a Sunday?

Food was atrocious (bland and rushed, our burgers were even put together properly) and on top of that, we waited over 30 minutes. I can understand the service might be abysmal on a day like today but... the place is absolutely disgusting and filthy and definitely not because of a day's operation. Pretty sure they don't have proper hygiene standards so... ya... save yourself and avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I will start with the good. The food was good all of us 
enjoyed what we ordered great price and good variety.

The bad is the service. It's hopelessly slow. To the point that I called the restaurant to ask for the bill. They didn't answer so I left a message. Servers are way over worked.

Finally, the ugly, management was standing around and no help. The meals all arrived as they were made so one person was having their main and others didn't have a starter. 

I will not be going back"}
{"text":"This place has been one of my favorites hangout spots for a while now. Food and drinks are ok but price is better than most places and I usually always enjoy the ambiance. Good music, fun servers/bartenders. 

I am not sure if today was just a bad day for the servers  or maybe its their first time in the industry but service was horrible.  When we were trying to get the servers attention, to ask for the napkins they did not bring, she kept trying to look away. Not very subtlety.  Finally she brings us 1 see through napkin! We are 2 people eating nachos. Next servers walks by grabs our plate of food without asking if we are done or even if we need anything else. 

I will honestly not be going back."}
{"text":"I tried the perogies and salad for lunch. The Caesar salad was ok except bacon bits was , I felt, bit weird crunchy tasting and not like bacon. Also the perogies were bad. I'm not sure if they cooked it from frozen because it was hard to use a folk jammed into it and not soft like the real thing. I left them on plate."}
{"text":"I believe I am being generous with this review.  I know that one doesn't go to the Red Room to experience fine dining and the best customer service in town--However, I had an interesting experience this week.  We had ordered a pitcher of beer and as I was drinking the first pint, the pint glass bottom just fell off of the glass.  The whole pint of beer soaked my shirt and pants, and it was something I've never experienced before.  We let one waitress know--she was clearly inexperienced and was extremely flustered...we could tell she was nervous as she brought us a handful of napkins, but rushed off nervously and in her nervousness took the napkins with her.  Understandable.  Then another server--a thin hipsterish guy came by, to which we explained what happened.  He was not understanding-  just saying pretty much that these things happen---we asked to be comped at least, because through no fault of our own, a pint of beer was spilled.  To which he said \"we can't do that\"....long story short I had to fight to get comped for something so ridiculous.  I even told him \"my shirt is ruined\" to which he replied with a huge trace of attitude, \"Your shirt is NOT ruined\"...how would he know? My shirt could have been a silk shirt or something...

Anyways I got that pint after arguing with him--He apologized later which made things better.  Another server came by to offer us free appetizers...that was much better too.  So they redeemed themselves that way.  I just didn't enjoy feeling like I was the one that felt like I was in the wrong."}
{"text":"There's a Green Room up on Bloor, and I don't know if there's any relation between them, but the décor and menu is very similar. It's got cheap pitchers of beer and cheap Pad Thai. There's a patio in the summer, but again, it's more of a cozy winter spot. People most commonly go there before or after a show at the El Mocambo up the street. It's in the perfect local and good for all budgets of course"}
{"text":"My first review - woohooo!!!!

....sadly, it's not going to be that great first experience. I stopped by the red room during the sangria crawl. The first thing that strikes you is the location - great lively area. On entering, the interior lighting is good for a causal occasion and the bar is pretty spacious. Ok, I will get down to the important part, service. I just have one word to describe it - Nonchalant. As I previously mentioned it was a sangria crawl and in my opinion the wine content in the drink we were served was inadequate leaving the drink flat. 

Finally, the brightest side to the occasion - meeting the rest of the nice people that came along  :)"}
{"text":"THE MUSIC IS SO LOUD!!!!!! CAN YOU HEAR ME?!?!?!


Off the bat - just must mention the DISGUSTING bathrooms. They're not clearly marked which is which, doors always ajar (I'd think to keep ventilation going due to the stench because...), youre not allowed to FLUSH the SOILED TOILET PAPER.... EW. baskets of nasty toilet paper beside you in each stall. I don't know if they've changed it (but i've been so many times) but the hand drying system is one of those nasty cloths that spins around. YUCK. Ok.. now that that's done....

The Red Room! Yay!

Ok, I don't know why I hate so many things about this bar, yet always come back!? It's cheap. That's what you get, right? 

So the Red Room (I'm pretty sure) is owned by the same people as the Green Room and Nirvana. So in each place you pretty much get the same thing. Cheap and atmosphere. The food (although cheap) is shit. The service...meh. The cleanliness...NOPE! Just cheap. I think out of the three, the Green Room has the best atmosphere...The way it looks inside and the cute patio out back. The Red Room is on the busy street of Spadina with a crappy little deck-patio (not it's finest feature). But lots of seats, a pretty big establishment.

I've come here for brunch and for drinks and dinner. Brunch was cheap, it's not super delicious but it certainly does the trick. Actually, my favourite choice for brunch was the stuffed French toast (ham in between 2 french toasts...mm..). Generally, thier food is not very good. My boyfriend (for some strange reason) always orders the pad thai which is made with, we're pretty sure, ketchup dressing. When ordering sides like fries etc. the portion sizes are not anything special either. I've had an instance where a tuna melt smelled and tasted EXACTLY like dog food (never tasted the real thing, but i'm almost positive it was this tuna melt!). So... be wary about the food. Cheap is the main word.

The lighting is very dim and the music is always for some reason deafeningly loud. The service is meh. Although, one time we got a pitcher and it was flat as all hell, and she did give us a second pitcher for no charge (which should be the common custom). 

I don't know. If you come here, expect a somewhat dodgy place, not the finest food or drink experience. Expect cheap. It's what you make it when you fill it with friends or people you love, so that's why I keep coming here. Wouldn't necessarily recommend it, at least not without this fair warning."}
{"text":"get sloshed and eat  pretty bad food, but cheap so its a good place to end your night if you need to eat"}
{"text":"Red Room has always been a go to spot, but the ridiculous instances are piling up. 

1)

Charged me twice, paid with card, they insisted that it didn't go through and made me take out cash, i kept the receipt, obviously the transaction went through and it was the biggest hassle to get them to give me my money back. 

2)

Was there with a group of 3 and they insisted on charging us the 6 or more gratuity charge. We were going to to tip 17% but he insisted that we had to tip 18%, was ridiculous and cherry on top, he was the worst server--did not know what french fries were. 

3)

Was there last night, accosted by a staff member who said two grown men who i was with were there with underage girls the week before--they had simply never been to red room before yesterday. Dude wouldn't let it go, checked everyone's IDs and was so insistent that they had been there before. Was ridiculous, but at least a little funny. 

Like, honestly, probably will go back due to nostalgia, but if you aren't emotionally connected, you should avoid at all costs. Crown and Tiger now has a great Indian Food menu, you should try there instead."}
{"text":"The food and the prices here are great, and the decor is definitely cozy and welcoming...however the service here is by far the worst thing I have every experienced. The only reason Ive given this 3 stars and not lower is that I now go there expecting the terrible service and it has become part of the entertainment of Red Room"}
{"text":"Red Room. Use to go here quite abit a number of years back:) Was back this Saturday night for a friends going away party. Nothing has really changed. Still quite the dingy place. Service is dodgy but the place is dodgy too so one can't expect much. Logistics didn't work to well for us either but one can not expect logistical brilliance and accomodation from dodgy service. Let's get to the food. Cheap, and tasty. I had the Pad Thai as always and for late night food (we got there at 11:00) it definately hit the spot. Drinks were also dirt cheap. Doubles for 6.50. Reminded me why I use to frequent this place heavily back in the day. Random indie/alternative or whatever you call it today is on the music playlist. Look forward to stopping by again in another couple of years when I want to reminisce about the good old days. However, definately recommended for the younger crowd who are on a strict budget and are looking for a hip locale to hang at. Would give it a 3.5 if there was such a score."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place out because my friend said it was cheap and pitchers were a good price. So I went to check it out for first time with my husband. I ordered a half pint of sapporo and pint of sangria. The waiter with glasses was nice but the female waitress came over our table and without a word took our menus away very fast and she even cut her eye at me! I have never felt so insulted at a restaurant before it was like she didn't care if we were there at all because by the looks of it it was a full house and they get a lot of young students on a tight budget. She was unfriendly, I dont expect overly friendliness but the eye cutting was not cool. 
I had sapporo  at another place that day so when I tasted the sapporo it was watered down. I didnt know that its even possible or legal. I know the taste of sapporo, but this tasted funny, bland and watered down. Sangria was not sangria, its a fruit punch full of orange juice and sprite.  I think sangria should be mostly wine and fruits, top it off with some sprite but this sangria tasted like fruit punch juice, not much wine.

It was busy and only two servers for such a Huge place...they were very unstaffed. Waiter was literally running from one end to another. If you're that busy you can afford more than 2 staffs on a busy night so paying customers and tipping customers can have the service they deserve.

to be honest I really liked the brie and avocado sandwich it was good and tasty. When it comes to food im very easy so it was decent for me. 

Overall brie sandwich was good, sapporo pint watered down and not good. I wouldnt recommend this place, I can get legit beers on tap for a lot cheaper at other places.  Im not going to throw my money away because the price on menu is low, when in fact im not getting what im paying for, and quality is low; water down beer is watered down and is illegal."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks. Cheap food. Cool atmosphere. Did I mention Cheap drinks? Food was pretty good! And the service was very good. The place was packed but our glasses were never empty and everything came amazingly fast. I love this place!"}
{"text":"It's cheap and hipster without trying. The food is OK and the pitchers are cheap enough. They don't take debit though."}
{"text":"The Red Room ... Oh god, it's so tough to review this place. Where to begin??

THE WONDERFUL:

- Choice. Seriously. This place has everything. You can come here for breakfast. You can come here for brunch. You can come here for lunch. You can come here for dinner. You can come here for drinks, finger food, as part of a night on the town. The menu is HUGE. It has everything from Pad Thai, to chicken curry, to traditional sandwiches, to pasta, to burgers, to French toast, to poutine and quite literally everything in between. Oh, and there's a wide range of teas, coffees, juices, beverages, and cocktails.

- The taste! Everything I've tried here (and I've tried a lot - most of the above listed dishes and drinks, in fact) has tasted great. Full of flavour, everything in balance, mostly mouth-watering. (Why am I writing this review just before lunch? Mhmm....)

- Value. This place is as cheap as you'd get in Toronto. I discovered it the first morning I arrived in the city on my visa, and ate there religiously for my first few weeks while searching for a job and an apartment. I would have starved if it weren't for this place! Even when I got a job and moved out to the east end, I still continued to return, as the portion sizes are GINORMOUS, and will keep you full all day. Not only are their base prices well below the city's average, additional deals are offered on some parts of the menu, e.g.: soup and sandwich for 6.75 (or something), add on coffee to breakfast for just 1.75, etc, etc.

- Layout.  It manages to be cosy, yet also inviting to large groups, with most tables offering long benches as seating. Décor is mostly Asian, with a trendy, modern twist. There's an outdoor patio for those summer scorchers.

If choice, taste, value and layout are all you value in a restaurant, then stop reading and consider this place a five-star establishment.


THE BAD:

- The service is overall, quite bad. Slow and unfriendly. I had the experience of our waiter not believing we were tipping enough, so he just took our money and kept the residual change without even asking if we wanted any money back. This was after this particular server began to know my boyfriend and I as regulars, so his actions made us feel as though we were stingy and not tipping enough (even though we were leaving moderate tips for the service encountered).

THE HORRIFYING:

- I can cope (easily) with the poor service, but I cannot accept poor hygiene standards. Unfortunately, I read a recent report stating that the Red Room failed a hygiene and safety inspection - one minor infraction, four significant infractions. I can turn a blind eye to many things, but not to food safety and hygiene standards. For this reason alone, I will not return to the Red Room. What a shame."}
{"text":"WORST customer service experience of life.

It took about 4 years (or 30 min) to get our drink orders even though we were one of three tables on a Sunday...the server has the worst attitude in history. Gave my friend a broken glass and then rolled his eyes when she requested one that wasn't going to cause her to to have to go to the emergency room. How dare she?!

I had to take off early and they wouldn't let me pay my bill (which was a pitcher of beer and one corona). There was 5 of us and they forced us to have it one on cheque...fair enough but I was paying credit card and didn't know what my portion costed and also had no cash. I was directed to the ATM  since I couldn't pay for my portion on my credit card (great to pay $2 fees which I was happy to remove from this jerks tip..) 

Our server should get fired or quit. 

The good - it's cheap...

The bad - literally everything else."}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap, decent food and somewhere to get drunk - good place. If you're looking for friendly staff, quick and reliable service, and an atmosphere for a quiet night out - bad place. I'm torn because the food was pretty good so clearly the kitchen staff is alright, but the front staff is hard to find, hard to communicate with, and at times downright rude. Food was good enough that I'll give them a second chance, but I won't be expecting any smiles or greeting as I walk in this time."}
{"text":"If you had asked me a month ago what I thought of the Red Room, I probably would have at *least* given it a 3/5 if not a 4/5 based simply on the amount of food versus the price you pay. I had always ordered a couple of staples, which were cooked reasonably well and filled the void in my stomach.

However (and this is a big however), I have since lowered them to 1 star. If I could give them no stars, I would. I eat here fairly frequently, at least once sometimes twice a month and I don't even live in Toronto. Last month I ordered the soup and sandwich deal and was told the soup of the day was either tomato chickpea and cream of broccoli. I usually quite enjoy their cream of broccoli soup, but what I was served (both taste and texture) was more like a wilted old lettuce soup. It was disgusting. I kept trying to eat it, thinking to myself - there's something wrong with this soup. My mother-in-law was the first to pipe up to our waitress about it (whom we tried to track down for a good 10 minutes because no one ever checks on their tables there). There's something wrong with the soup, I tell her. \"Oh, no there's nothing wrong with it - it's actually asparagus soup and I just forgot to tell you.\" Exact words. Not paraphrasing. It was disgusting. I was brought the dreadful tasting tomato chickpea soup instead and just couldn't bring myself to finish it.

And this is just the beginning because - wait - there's more. Last week I went in again and decided to order the Phad Thai. Big mistake. I have had the dish before both there as well as from many other restaurants in the Greater Toronto area and have always quite liked the dish.  The dish had two pictures of chilli peppers next to it, which most restaurants have despite the dish being more sweet than it is spicy. I took a bit of it and almost threw up. There was no flavour there - it was just spice. I complained to the waitress who at first gave me a bit of attitude but said I could order something else. I had a strange feeling so I said \"Are you planning on charging me for this food I can't eat?\". \"Of course I am, there's nothing wrong with it.\" She replies haughtily. I tried to explain that it was beyond hot and that it was nearly impossible to eat. It's not normally like this. \"Well that's not our fault, its yours because you didn't read the menu.\" I was aghast and she even brought the menu over to point out the two chilli peppers. She was beyond being explained to and was at a point where she was arguing with me, not letting me speak and telling me that it was my fault.

She kept telling me I had to pay for a meal that was inedible even by the poorest of standards so I ended up walking out. I had at one point even asked to speak to the owner or manager. She actually smiled at me, crossed her arms and said they weren't in that day. She said she was in charge and that's just the way things are.

I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant before in my life. Yes, the prices are good and the servings are large - but the service is gawd awful to the point where they should be reported to the Better Business Bureau. 

The atmosphere is tolerable on some days and  rank the next - the music being the most obvious culprit. With no standards as to what can and will be played you can be tortured with just about anything your nightmares can come up with - and mid lunch, I just don't want to hear a skipping CD of some woman who is swinging a cat by the tail to drums when all I want to do is listen to the person across the table from me tell me a story.

For the average student this place may be fine as long as you never have a complaint and stick to the same meal each time. Never complain because it's the customers fault, not the kitchens. Bring some ear plugs or your MP3 player and last but not least, shut up and eat the food they give you....or else.

...or else you can just skip it altogether. Probably your best plan of action."}
{"text":"Red Room's sangria and avocado & brie sandwich are AMAZING. I've often tried duplicating their sandwich at home but its never the same... So I keep coming back for more!

It's a great place to go to with a friend or a large group and it won't break the bank."}
{"text":"This place is my favourite out of the trifecta of ~Green Room/ Red Room / Java House . The atmosphere is hippie-ish but in a cosy way and it doesn't feel gross like the other two. The food is good and very very cheap, same with drinks. This is a great place to hang out with good friends on a budget. The service can be pretty absent but I haven't found it to be damning, maybe because I really just go there to hang out, if I had obligations afterwards I might feel more annoyed by it. 

It's fun here, I recommend it."}
{"text":"I don't understand why the ratings for this place are so bad, I LOVE this place, the music and atmosphere are fantastic and the food is even better, the price of the food and drinks is so cheap and it's absolutely delicious. This is definitely one of my favourite spots."}
{"text":"Food and beer was okay.  The servers were so incredibly rude that we hated the place.  They were unbelievably sassy. So unnecessary, I will never go back unless I'm looking for cut eye."}
{"text":"I was sexually assaulted there on October 31,2015 at around 10:30-11:00pm. No manager, no staff member came to help me."}
{"text":"Came here with a couple of friends, an appetite, and a pitiful bank account. Pleasantly surprised on the bill. The cheap food was pretty good. My friend ordered calamari and really liked it. The grill cheese was a hit for me as well. Decently priced pitchers which tasted as they should. Super chill atmosphere to hang out with a group of friends.

Cons: our chairs were rickety as hell, like it was made in an eighth grade woodshop class. I felt that if I gained another pound the whole thing would crumble. The music also got a bit loud at times but I didn't find it overbearing (the music wasn't a bad selection, so rickety chair jam sessions most definitely happened). Glasses weren't too clean but that seems to be a norm for various places in the GTA.

Overall try it out, especially if you want decent food and a buzz without breaking bank!"}
{"text":"Red Room is a decent place for a well-priced meal or drink when you're out with your friends for the night. The Asian-influenced menu has some goodies to check out. The environment is pretty chill (and literally red). 

However, don't expect anything too phenomenal from the place. The food isn't going to blow you away and I've had some bad experiences with some seriously rude servers. The Red Room is a great example of \"you get what you pay for\""}
{"text":"Dining here was a weird experience. Te menu was grimy; the bathrooms were worse, and the general atmosphere was gloomy.

We were basically ignored by our waiters, one of whom disappeared half way through and never reappeared, the other who appeared to hate life (or his job). We ordered a pitcher of sangria, which was mediocre and came with mismatched glasses. There was a gap in between when we were served that wasn't explained or apologized for, and the perogies I ordered were lackluster. The salad was just a pile of lettuce with some carrots that seemed to have been soaking in water for a few hours (or days...). We waited forever for our bill, and even then, we were not at all pleasantly served. There were maybe two other tables at the time, so I really don't understand the terrible service. 

I was in great company, so that made it enjoyable, but I will not return."}
{"text":"Did this place change owners?  I come here all the time and always order the chicken wings with honey garlic sauce and spring rolls. Spring rolls were as good as always but this time the chicken wings literally tasted like water. I mean I can tell that they mixed honey and water cause of how runny the sauce was on the place. I politely asked if we could send it back to the kitchen, did not ask for a refund or anything. Just wanted it either remade or something else sent in it's place. The guy goes \"nope, we can't cause you ate it\" then leaves our table...... I ate one but okay? I left it at that cause I could tell this guy wasn't willing to accommodate. Anyways. This was my first bad experience here. Will be hesitant coming here again."}
{"text":"Truly awful food.  And it doesn't actually have to be awful, it's that they're clearly trying to cut every corner possible and don't care if customers know it.  

In the summer they also allow smoking on their porch (which I'm pretty sure is illegal), and the porch is completely open to the restaurant, so the smoke blows right inside.  I've had to change tables before because someone was literally smoking a foot away from me while I was eating.  

I'm giving this place two stars because despite the terrible food and the lenient attitude about smoking, the drinks are cheapish, it's a decent atmosphere, and the staff don't care how long you hang out."}
{"text":"Always a great place for a cheap pitcher of sangria on a lazy Saturday afternoon.  I never eat the food, but my date had the all day french toast and eggs with no complaints."}
{"text":"This is a place you go to when you don't care how old the seats are. Very casual atmosphere and very cheap drinks. It's really not bad if you look beyond the sticky film left on the tables and the water spots on the glasses. It's also a really good place to get non-authentic pad thai which is actually a big portion for a small person like myself, but still quite satisfying after starving myself from breakfast and lunch. The service is actually standard and reasonable. There are many tables and it's so dark in there that it's hard to get any hostess' attention. At least the music playing was good. It was also loud so that I couldn't hear my date talk about how much he loved string theory."}
{"text":"I was here today with my sister. Cheap is right! Price is just right for the two of us. But obviously, you get what you pay for. I had the french toast, can't go wrong with that and my sister had the vegetable stirfry, which was okay.. just okay. I've been here before and same story, except that time I used the washroom and was disgusted. I know, I know, kind of petty but it made a difference. I didn't use it this time just for the same reason, so not sure if it has changed."}
{"text":"Red - the colour of Communism, interior design for brothels, Ferraris, and that delicious liquid which turns to this colour after being exposed to oxygen.  
This restaurant is not among those good things.  It would in a category of bad red things like....the tempranillo wine, cold sores, and Mountain Dew Code Red.

I was invited to Kensinton Market (cringe) by an OCAD graduate friend of mine to an exhibit which she was apart of.  I absolutely do not visit this area under any leisurely circumstances, I'm afraid that liberals may jump out at me and shout liberals things at my double windsor and oxfords.  I came here at night, which was extra frightening.  
Not ten minutes after arriving, she decides to for dinner with her select group of friends.  I couldn't believe that I was about to be left behind after making the effort venturing into this hostile neighbourhood just for her.  I just HAD to invite myself!

We walked to The Red Room, a place I never managed to notice despite walking down Spadina a thousand times.  

I hated the design....I mean décor.  The place looked like the hippy rendition of Montana's.  So here I am sitting at the table with this OCAD woman, her boyfriend who looked like every Shakespeare character I've ever seen in book illustrations, and their artiste friends.  I should have had the foresight to foreseen this harrowing disposition.  

The service here is bottom-tier, the food is Asian inspired mall cuisine, and I had absolutely no clue what type of music was blasting from the speakers.    

An evening devoid of chivalry, refinement, or good manners.  
The Red Room...yeah, I can think of a way to make this place live up to its name.."}
{"text":"Popular student eatery and local meeting spot.  Families eat here too, and they have seating for large groups.  Main plates are under $10, like shrimp pad thai.  A large breakfast consisting of eggs, bacon and toast goods is about $5.  Beer feels good to consume there.  Seating is available outdoors on the small patio as well.  Nearby is the famous El Mocambo music venue.  Best way to pay is to visibly leave the money with the tip and leave.  Otherwise, after many years of experience, it takes them a very long time to get around to collecting and giving change unless you go after them.  No idea why, it seems they are trained to do that."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite pubs in Toronto! Not because of the decor or the food, but just because it's so cheap! I'm practically still living on a student budget, so if I can get a hamburger and a drink for no more than $10, I'll keep coming back for more.  

I haven't tried a lot of the food here, but I can say that their hamburger is decent.  It comes with fries and if I remember correctly, it only costs about $6-7!  As for drinks, their sangria is good, and their mixed drinks are strong.  It can get pretty busy here, especially since they have a nice little patio on Spadina, so don't expect the best service. But, if you want to go out for some drinks in a relaxed atmosphere without it costing you a small fortune, this is definitely your place!"}
{"text":"From the first time I entered, I never thought I'd give the Red Room 5 stars. I'll admit, I might be getting soft and sentimental in my old age (of 20-odd years) - but it holds a special place in my heart, and at the end of the day I think the 5 stars are justified.

The food: DIRT cheap, but still yummy. The avocado and brie sandwich ($4.25) is amazing -- elsewhere a sandwich of this size and creamy delectableness would probably run you closer to $10. It's my go-to. The pad thai ($7.50) is also generous and noms, and outcompetes many a $10+ pad thai elsewhere. Other things friends have tried have also received positive reviews (they do a pretty legit all-day brunch also), but these two dishes are what bring me back. Whatever you pick, you're bound to be impressed by the eye-popping quality/quantity:price ratio. 

The drinks: how are they so cheap. ($2.75 bottle specials? $14 sangria pitchers? $18 litres of wine?) I don't understand - but I'm happy to profit!

The vibe: a hippie/student lair with questionably tasteful decor & art, complete with invariably hippie/student patronage. They also have a patio up front, which on a breezy summer evening is the perfect place to gossip over dirt cheap drinks.

Overall, the Red Room is not dressed to impress. What it is is a place where you go with your friends to eat simple tasty food, get cheap drinks, and make some lovely memories to a casual but lively backdrop. I have lost count of how many times I have been here, and I will continue to return every time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"All I have to say is hot, hot, hot, and I wish I was talking about the atmosphere but rather the hot is reserved for the temperature. After finally getting a table it took more than 15 minutes and the arrival of two other yelpers to get some service. In fact if I remember correctly we had to leave the table to get someone to come over. Once we ordered the pitcher of sangria for the table I supplied my desired food request hoping that one would shortly follow the other to our table. The sangria arrived fruity and delicious if not a little on the less alcoholic side, but my food took another 20 minutes. I will mention that I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich which was good, but can hardly imagine what took so long. The music and seating were eclectic, but i cant really see sitting in that sauna for more than an hour. Happily the bill was on the smaller side, and as a broke student I can fully appreciate a good meal for a good deal. Bottom line, food good, sangria OK, and restaurant ambiance sub par . Try this for an up-from-pub experience."}
{"text":"Last night a group of us stopped in at the Red Room for some drinks and snacks. I had always been to the Green Room, but never to the Red Room.

We sat in a super comfy booth and indulged in sangria and greasy fare.

The food was really good, as was the sangria. I was feelin' the vibe at the Red Room, however the crowd was a little sparse and the atmosphere was a little too dingy for my liking.

The staff was super friendly and the prices were extremely reasonable.

Overall, a cool place to hang out, but I probably wont be stopping back in any time soon."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is a mismatch. Some days you get good service, others nope. Some days you get a nice plating other times it's just meh. Got my orders right but since it's a different chef (I think) the quality changes. The food quality is meh. Decoration inside is almost random. 

If you decide to go save yoselves and don't sit on the booths near the stairs leading to the washroom. The smell might get to you. Their washroom has a self drying towel as tissue replacement (not a bad thing but it gets kinda gross). 

The Vietnamese coffee is only good when the Viet ladies are working, otherwise they don't know how to make it."}
{"text":"Oh Red Room. This place was a staple for me during University. I lived right down the street from here and I can honestly say I have had Breakfast and Dinner with beers in the same day here many o' times. Sad.. probably- but when it's that cheap why not? 

General rule, go for whats popular here AKA cheap sangria and pretty ok Pad Thai. Always my go-tos. 

If you've ever been to and liked Java house/ Green Room / Nirvana then you'll probably like this place too . Same general menu and vibes. Also They always have great tunes playing :).
If you're looking to get full and or a little tipsy on a budget check this place out!"}
{"text":"I go here a lot.

It probably averages out to once a week over the year, and there's a good reason for that. Oh, and they've started taking debit as well as cash, just FYI.

The service is notoriously slow. Expect that. You will get charged a gratuity and on a single bill for groups of 5+. Expect that as well. The music is sometimes bad, and sometimes very loud. There are certain food items that you will probably dislike. [Edit:] The washrooms have been redone as of Summer 2012. Before, they were not nice.

But, with all those caveats, the Red Room has a special place in my heart (read: stomach, and also wallet). I adore the pad thai from here, as well as the tuna sandwiches. Generally, you get huge portions for a minimal price. Most of the servers are very helpful, and if you actually ask them if something is good or not, they won't lead you astray. I personally like the sangria and the beer is also cheap. If you're in a rush to get going, you have the option to go up to the counter to pay.

Oh, and additionally, this is a place that will tailor your meal to a vegetarian or vegan standard and substitute things in for you to enhance your value/flavour.

All-in-all, I'm a fan. I live close-by and have taken many people to the place. Those with their nose a bit higher in the air have an opinion about it, but most people seem to enjoy themselves."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this place because there are 259 things on their menu. Less is more friends. I don't have confidence in a place that has chow mein and grilled cheese on the same menu. I should've went with my gut (literally). Here is my \"grilled cheese\".. literally slightly toasted bread with kraft singles and shredded cheese Not. Melted. At. All!! 

Don't trust a chef that messes up grilled cheese"}
{"text":"I didn't HATE the place! Hate is a strong word but I wouldn't come back again for its food! My friend says that people come at night and drink. I came here during the middle of the afternoon and I didn't enjoy my experience here. 

Food: They had a lot of asian fusion. I for one, despise Asian fusion cuisine! It's just weird... if i want Asian food, I would get asian food. Unless I have no other alternative... 

I ordered a burger there and it tasted OK. Not something i would pay that much for again. The prices weren't high but taking the taste into consideration, i wouldn't pay over $10 for an OK burger and fries. The french fries weren't that great... I had to force myself to eat it; just so i didn't waste food. 

Service: VERY SLOW. The place was almost empty during the middle of the day but the services wasn't very good. The waiter was slightly stuck-up! He wasn't very friendly but he wasn't rude. He seemed unhappy to be there and serving us. 

The atmosphere: The place looked old like it needs to be renovated. IDK if that's intentional or not."}
{"text":"It's a cool place to have some beers and simple cocktails, it's affordable, spacious, and good service. Food is ok (maybe could make it more tasty!)... still worth it to meet some friends and don't spend much!"}
{"text":"AS GOOD AS IT GETS! I absolutely LOVE IIIITTTT!!! 

1) The lighting is great! I only go during the evening/night. It's somewhat dark (bright enough to read and not be tripping over stuff!) and the candle light is such a cute effect. A great place for a date too! 

2) The food is taaaaaaaaaasty! I've tried their nachos, soup, avacado sammich & (my favourite haha) their FRIED RICE! For the price that it is ($7 for a plate of fried rice the size of your head), it's just too good. 

3) The servers/waiters/waitresses are super nice, and fairly attractive haha. They also know their menu pretty well.

4) The music is great & they have a TV, a debit machine, as well as WIFI

5) It's great for two OR large groups!

I remember this one time, my friend and I asked for  doggy bags... for my chicken fried rice - they drew a chicken and for my friends shrimp fried rice they drew a shrimp! haha, I just thought that was super cute

looovee"}
{"text":"My go to place for nachos and a pitcher of Sangria. They kill the nachos with cheese, but who has ever complained about too much cheese?
All of the food I have tried there is good.
Hummus and pita, check. A really good garden salad with a Thai inspired dressing, check. 
I relived my 12 year old dreams by getting chicken nuggets, (which is like my family) and fries. 
Those were also tasty too.
Red Room is too good. It has everything to my heart's content. 
 I have taken many of my friends here, and they love it! 

I tend to go to places whenever they're not busy, and maybe that's why I have never had any problem-os with the food here."}
{"text":"(2 stars)
It was a good day spending time with my lovely friends.  However it wasn't a good experience we had with the restaurant service.   Our waitress didn't seem to pay attention to our needs.  After serving our food and drinks, she disappeared for more than half an hour.  We tried hard to call for her attention but she never walked close to our table.  It wasn't busy at the time we were there.  There were only few tables at the time.  We only needed WATER but it never came.  

After half an hour we saw another waiter showed up.  He noticed that we needed his help.  He was busy with another table but he came by after that.  We got water afterward but the waitress never came back again. 

Service was very poor and they really need to improve it.  Though the food was ok, their service was bad.  Wait staff is the face of the restaurant.  If the service is bad, I don't think we should talk about coming back at all.  

Food: 2.5 
Price: 3.5 reasonable price 
Service: doesn't exist! They need a big change!"}
{"text":"Red Room is a hip-and-happening place great for student group hangouts. This is where I'd come to enjoy a pub night out with super cheap food and drinks. The service was decent--came here for the first time with a group of 10 friends on St.Patty's day, was surprised there was space for us at around 11pm and we got seated pretty quickly. It was quite busy but our food was brought to us in good time. Unfortunately our server was unable to split the bill for us, and there was auto 15% gratuity which we were unaware of, but other than that I'd say Red Room is my new favourite pub."}
{"text":"Came here on Friday. It was hot as hades in here.. Like it felt like the kitchen fan was blowing unto us. Also the beer was so skunked it was undrinkable. 

AVOID AVOID AVOID"}
{"text":"Red Room... I ordered a veggie cheese omlette because I AM A VEGETARIAN... you brought me a HAM AND CHEESE omlette and I only realized after ONE BITE that it was HAM! I thought the veggies were inside the fold of the omlette and since its so dark in the place I couldnt see the ham!!!

I did in fact order a veggie cheese omlette because the waitress showed me the order on paper the kitchen made the error. However I haven't eaten meat in 3 years... I did spit out the bite of the omlette but I was still a little grossed out nonetheless.

When I did alert the staff of this error the offered me 1/2 off my food. I was like ok. but they didnt include my appetizer... so I only ended up getting 2.75 off my omlette which I think should have been comp'd. You might want to improve your customer service a bit on that one. I've been going to this place for a long long time but never again after that. 

I'm just glad I am only a vegetarian and not like some religion that doesnt eat pork."}
{"text":"We were a party of two people and when we saw are bill they added a 15% gratuity charge. Spoke to the waitress and she removed it. Keep an eye on your bill. Don't know why they charged us in the first place. I can see it if we were 6 or more people. Also fries were terrible."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE RESTAURANT!!!

This place has a bad reputation for its service. They are VERY slow. VERY. I dont even know why i agreed to eat there today. There were 2 other people in the restaurant when we arrived.  I figured it shouldnt take too long to get our food right? WRONG!! My friend got her food in 30 minutes, and mine came out after 40 minutes! Once my food arrived, i told them i was no longer interested in eating since i had waited so long. No apologies or explanations from the server at all! Prior to this, i heard another lady complaining about the quality of food and the amount of time it took them to cook it. Her meal ended up being comped, as well as mine (clearly!). How this place makes its business is beyond me. 

I have to say, the clientele on the patio is a bit sketchy too. Drunk before noon and smoking out on the patio (is that even allowed anymore?). NEVER EVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"How this place has even 3 stars is beyond me.

I've been to this place a few times over the past few years and every time only because someone else wanted to try it.

I read reviews of the great selection of food but what good is a wide variety of food when none of it tastes any good? Seriously, nothing I've every eaten there was good, everything is bland and not cooked well.

The service is even more horrific. It hardly exists. Expect to be in there way way longer than you want. It takes 15 minutes to find someone to seat you, another 20 before you can find someone to order and another 20 minutes just to ask for the bill. Where is everybody? Perhaps the fact that there is no standard dress code for the staff is the reason I can never find them

All I want to see is some effort to change and become a more professional establishment but its been so many years and nothing has changed. So disappointing."}
{"text":"I have to agree with most people on this one. Although this makes a cool spot to spend an evening it's way too loud to enjoy yourself. It's terrible hard to get any service. And the food... well let's not even talk about the food.

I give it an 'okay'. Simply because I've had so many fun times there despite the quality of the venue."}
{"text":"Is there any rating lower than 1 star? The service was terrible. They took forever to take our order. Then the food took an eternity to come out. When the fries we had ordered finally arrived over half an hour after we sat down, we found a piece of hair in it. Then there was another long wait for the rest of the food. We decided that we no longer wanted anything from here after, and they were going to charge us for the fries with the hair in it. (Until we had to explain that we were not going to pay for them). The waiter looked as if he may have been stoned, because when we finally decided to leave after 45 mins of waiting - he approached us on the street telling us our food was ready. We had already paid for the drinks we had ordered and told the cashier we were not waiting for the food any longer. It was clear that we didn't want it after we had left the restaurant. And he seemed very distraught and confused that we were upset. Terrible service, I guarantee I will never be back."}
{"text":"Red Room has a great atmosphere and cheap prices. Definitely a Toronto staple! It's cozy and can get pretty busy on weekends but is mostly free during weekdays. While I still prefer the Green Room to it, Red Room is a pretty great alternative."}
{"text":"Guys, this place is fine. The food is NOT great, but NOT terrible, it's fine. I would advise against eating chicken here, or anything when you're not drunk. Although I have been here for soup when I've been under the weather and it definitely did the trick.

For drinks, this place is better than fine--it's cheap--Wednesday's special is $2.75 draft bottles, which I appreciate. It's a good place to drink cheap beer and liquor.

Warning: there are a lot of bros here."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place as I have had many a fun time at the Red Room. However most of those times fall under a very specific set of guidelines. 

First, stick to the patio. Second, do not order a real meal, because the dishes can be low-rent in both flavour and well, actually flavour is the most important thing! As such, I generally kept my orders to only their sandwiches, such as the Avocado and Brie or their Cheese sandwiches or just beer. They are both cheap and good. Avoid any dish that comes with a salads (they are really bad) or their pastas and their coffee.  It also helps if you come with a friend or two! I can only imagine, coming to this place by yourself is probably the definition of dreadful. 

Remember, like its sister locations, The Green Room and Nirvana, The Red Room is the very definition of  a 'dive bar.' You go there fully expecting that and if anyone comesexpecting something different, then they are not seeing the place for what it is. Like expecting burgers and fries at a Chinese restaurant.  

There is a certain personality and age group that will find the Red Room very appealing however, many will not... So to generalize, if you are on a student budget, or an actual student, under say, 28 and/or the proverbial 'Queen street type,' then chances are that you will like the joint.  

The inside of the Red Room during the day feels like a cave and sometimes it smells like one... although in fairness, I do like the Bohemian feel of this joint, with bookshelves here, a piano there, the retro booths, the somewhat messy look is interesting to me. Although like the Green Room this place looks much better by candlelight than by sunlight. So time any visits accordingly. 

Oh, and since some Yelps have brought this up, personally when I have been there, the bathrooms smelled just like bathrooms.  

Do not expect the best/fastest service unless you are at the patio, which normally seems to get the most attention.  So basically if you set your expectations to \"Dive Bar,\" then you will have a good time. If you are expecting something more then just avoid this place."}
{"text":"I think they are from the same batch of owners as Java House and the Green Room. So the food is average but the prices are great for a person on a tight budget. My friends like the beer specials and/or prices. 

I organized a meet up here. We had a great turnout. Orders got mixed up, the staff didn't come back to check on us very often and he and she were not very pleasant or cheerful. 

Great space for small or large groups, good bathrooms, the music was a little loud where we were sitting and they said they couldn't do anything about it."}
{"text":"University crowd, cheap food, cheap drinks.
One of theose \"regular bars\" that everyone just agrees with but nobody necessarily likes.  Big enough to have a lot of people, but if you know better places go there.  It's just for those times when you're scrambling to pick a place in a central location for people on a budget."}
{"text":"The food isn't incredible but the portions and cheap prices always make me come back. This is a popular spot for u of t students so it can get pretty loud in the evenings."}
{"text":"Oh, the Red Room.  Well, I'm feeling a bit old to drop by, but I have a friend who likes it, so I end up there every once in a while.  The beer list is actually okay, and yes, everything on the menu is very, very cheap.

I'd dropped in here before going, and saw the pad thai controversy.  I love a good pad thai, and even a tasty bad one, so I thought I'd take the opportunity to try it and weigh in, so here's my take.

OK, it's not authentic, and it is distinctly tomato-y.  It's like the bizarre love child of pad thai and a creamy curry.  It's a bit spicy, which is unusual.  There are no peanuts, no cilantro, and you get a lemon wedge instead of a lime.

On the other hand - it's cheap as can be, huge, hot, and actually quite tasty.  Once you get over your initial this-isn't-really-much-like-authentic-pad-thai reaction, you might enjoy it too.  I could definitely see myself ordering this calorie binge again some time."}
{"text":"Amazing food, very cheap. Our go to place for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Pasta, sandwiches, noodles, banh mi, soup, burger all of them I have tried and was never disappointed.

Drinks are cheaper than average,  Sangria tastes a bit watered down.

 This place is a perfect place for students. With cheap,  good quality food and drinks."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of the Red Room, the only reason it gets 2 stars is location, sangria and setting so that a group can clump close enough together to socialize with each other. 

A lot of people I know just enjoy going here, and I don't see why. Their food is not great, Chinatown is right there if someone is looking for proper Chinese food. As for their menu Italian menu options, it's just mediocre. Their Pad Thai is a favourite option but since I'm no Pad Thai fan my opinion would be biased. My \"favourite\" menu item is the grilled cheese sandwich, and one Italian dish actually, but I can't quite remember what it was. The sangria served here does have it's reputation, and it is pretty good. 

Their service is what turned me off  initially, it's very very slow and not very friendly either. And while the speed may be due to the fact it's busy often, I still think they could do a better job at it. 

I suggest the Green Room if you want a setting like this (not a huge fan of the green room either, but I prefer that over Red Room) and go to a restaurant on Baldwin Village if you want good food (or somewhere in Chinatown)."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for in life, and that statement is ever-so-true for The Red Room. Don't expect much when you're eating large sandwiches with soup for only $5. 

Decent, extremely cheap food makes this place a win for those on a budget. Lots of computer plugs, free WIFI and bottomless coffee makes it hard to resist for working away from home. I find afternoons to be relatively slow and quiet. 

Ultra-cheap booze and proximity to U of T makes it a popular student hangout. Inane  conversations abound, so if you're solo bring some headphones."}
{"text":"Great place for cheap pours. $4.5 Single shot, $7 double shots. For pitchers they have $10 pitcher of beer and $14 for a pitcher of spiked punch. Food is cheap too but I wasn't hungry.

Spacious and comfy. Friendly service. Free WiFi."}
{"text":"Well it's incredibly cheap, but it's still garbage that you're ingesting...slow service all the taps are dirty as hell."}
{"text":"Red room is what it is. An extremely affordable, University student hang-out with an eclectic menu to please everyone's palate. 

For less than $15, you can find yourself with an entree and beer/rail. The food is tasty enough, and mostly Asian influenced with sandwiches, and pastas sprinkled through.

I still visit occasionally because of the relaxed environment personally. It's dim and relaxed, a great first or last point of destination for any time of day
(Great for breakfast as well)."}
{"text":"Hungry and looking for a place to go that's open? This restaurant is really really good for price, they own Nirvanas and Java House, so it's the same menu but they make certain things differently. Nirvanas is still better, but this would be my number 2"}
{"text":"Came here after a late night out with friends. I hope this isn't the late-night-party-hunger-pangs talking, but the brie-avocado sandwich I ordered was amazing! Paired with sweet potato fries at no extra cost? Under $7? Fun times all around.

Please note that I can't testify for anything else on the menu though. I am always hesitant to order pad thai in a place where they also serve French toast."}
{"text":"One of the few placed in the city that give you a good bang for your buck. I go there atleast once a month if not more. Service is slow but friendly, so maybe not the best place to go if you want to be in and out. 

I've tried pretty much everything on thier menu and usually stick to a few of my favourite. Udon noodles, crispy noodle and quasadillas are my toop three favs.

I like the decor, though not a fan of the music they play.

Overall I give this place an \"A\"."}
{"text":"The next time you're drunkenly roaming the streets of Spadina and College, be sure to stumble into The Red Room. The food and alcohol is cheap, the lighting is dim (so you can remain in the shadows while you continue to obliterate yourself).

The staff is good, and very hipster. If you're not wearing plaid, glasses, a beard (guy or girl), a kilt, a toque, and/or denim suspenders from the 90s, you might feel a bit out of place. But that shouldn't stop you from enjoying The Red Room.

4/5"}
{"text":"After not making it into the Horse shoe tavern for a concert we ventured over here to continue celebrating a friends birthday in mid March. Their food is cheap and yummy, service is okay, sangria is YUMMY and cheap. Weird crown, very dark inside and music was sometimes okay, definitely for a casual night with cheap food and great friends. Talking was hard because of the music but otherwise it was a good enough place to hang out.

Would definitely go back to try some of their cheap food which includes noodles, rice, soups, spring rolls, pad thai, nachos, wings, sandwiches, and so much more."}
{"text":"Entering this establishment, I have no idea what to expect, I heard there were decent sangrias and it looked like a regular pub to me. I opened the menu and wow, I saw a lot of familiar dishes. This place has an unsuspecting Asian fusion menu. Ok...

I decide to try the udon stir fry and my partner orders the chow mein. Not only did it take more than 30 minutes for the food to come, this place was NOT busy, but when my order came is was not the udon stir fry but the Singapore noodles. When correcting the waiter, politely, the  response was, \"Oh well, that's what was written.\" Hmm, no kidding Sherlock but that's still not what I ordered and thanks for apologizing. 

The PITCHER of sangria came decently quick and as I'm not a red wine drinker it was a bit...underwhelming to say the least. The taste was bland but it did come with a bevy of fruits in it that did not do much but float at the top and becoming increasingly annoying when pouring. My partner then informs me that maybe we should crush the fruits to get some flavour out of it, ok well it's not supposed to be MY job to make the sangria taste good. But after we did that, it tasted phenomenal but still watery. 

The food came and my udon noodles were decent enough, very thick goopy sauce though. And my partner's chow mein was disgusting. They literally took egg noodles, floured them and DEEP FRIED them! OMG! That is NOT chow mein. Disappointment all around. I'm kicking myself for leaving such a large tip...must've been the 3/4 of a pitcher of sangria I drank..."}
{"text":"This place is awsome. Such great prices and amazing food! There are so may different options and all of the portions are huge considering how much you're paying! The service isn't the best but it's not that big of a deal considering the delicious food, sizes and prices! In that past I've gotten the Pad Thai, grilled cheese, onion rings, Greek salad, and fried rice and enjoyed all! I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times and I keep going back because it's cheap, but I keep leaving feeling disappointed.

The first I went, I got the grilled vegetable sandwich and soup. It was decently good. Better than what I make myself at home, but still not that special. I probably think it tasted better than it really did because I believe the two together came to like $6.50 or something ridiculously cheap.

The next time I came, I had the French toast. It was pretty bad. It was one of the few times I would have wanted to send it back but our waitress never came to check on us so I couldn't. All the syrup in the world couldn't have fixed the dryness that was this meal.

I went there again two nights ago. It was late, I needed cheap food. I really wanted something sweet and since the French toast was so bad last time, I decided to go with pancakes instead. Again, they were bad. Literally worse than the pre-made pancake mix at the store. Like last time, I would have sent it back, but the waitress never checked on us. 

Aside from the food, this restaurant really caters to specific people. If you want to have a quiet conversation over dinner, don't go here. If you want to talk very loudly over top of other people talking very loudly, go here. If you want to be able to see your food before you eat it, don't go here. If you want to eat in darkness, go here (just kidding, but it is really dark here). The waiters are friendly, but they never check on you. So if you want a refill, good luck. Also, the bathrooms are disgusting. 

I would really only go back here if it was super late at night, the nearby Chinese places weren't open, and/or I had very little money on me. 

As per the alcohol, I don't drink, but my boyfriend said his beer was pretty good and he had the vermicelli noodles which he also said were 'OK'. The beer was pretty cheap. I think it was $2.75 for 1/2 pint, $4.50 for a pint, and I forget how much for a pitcher.

In summary: cheap, bad-slightly better than average food, friendly but not good waiters, decent beer, gross washrooms, open late, loud, dark. You can do better. DO NOT take a first date here. Just don't. I forgot to menton this earlier, but they also have a pretty wide-ranging menu. Noodles, sandwiches, brunch, asian, indian, etc. But no pizza which is kind of weird."}
{"text":"Very inexpensive and mostly home made food (AMAZING and real chicken strips). The only thing that sucks is the servers forget about you for 20-30 mins at a time."}
{"text":"I've gone here both for casual dinner, and late- night drinks with friends. Given the portion size, the pricing is fantastic. The service is good. Admittedly, a lot of the food is not-so-great but  having sampled some 6 or so of the dishes on the menu, I can assure you that the chicken pad thai is probably the best thing on the menu, and is pretty damn good at that! :D

As far as late night drinks go, it's a bit loud, the music is pleasantly eclectic, and there's a chill vibe going so it's not too bad, but if you want to get out to a bar with some friends around U of T campus, there are definitely better options."}
{"text":"The Red Room was all dolled up for Halloween and it just felt so right. I came here with a couple friends for an evening of cheap eats and cheap booze and fell in love with the ambiance. It's dark, it's divey, and it's eclectic....that's my jam right there.

I was told I had to try their Pad Thai so I went for it, when in Toronto? Okay, maybe not. It was good, not traditional by any means, and cheap+delicious. I also got to try some of the crispy chow mein which was also up my alley. The best part? They give you pretty large servings as well. As a permanent resident of the U.S.A, I approve. 

For drinks we split a pitcher of their \"white sangria-y but not sangria\" drink. I didn't really look at the menu, my friend ordered. It was mostly mixer with a lot of white wine for $15.00 ish (can't remember exactly)."}
{"text":"This is a really strange but cool place, it seems they can't make up their mind on whether they want to be a pub or indian or chinese or thai or asian fusion or a bunch of other stuff, it's just a mish mash of a whole bunch of random foods but it actually works!

The decor is also really random but adds character to the place, and you can't complain about the cheap food with good portions. You'll see a lot of artsy and musician types here and they also have a bunch of vegetarian options as well. Whether you're looking for just a pub to kick back a few beers or are looking for some cheap good food to fill you up and you can't decide on what type of restaurant to go to just head over here and you'll get some good food!"}
{"text":"It's cheap. In both a good and bad sense. The food can be a bit burnt, dry, or otherwise less tasty than normally expected. The prices are low, especially compared to typical western pubs. The decor looks cheap, and the tables/chairs are crowded.

The service is fine (though I guess we were there on a not-too-busy night), the Asian-Western fusion food (bread, rice, noodles, etc.) seems to be neutral (not especially good or bad), and the inside is rather loud from all the chatter echoing."}
{"text":"I used to love eating at the Red Room. When I told this to people they used to look at me bewildered and say things like \"You actually eat the food there?\" I was new to the city at the time and so I figured they might be on to something.

I've not been there for food in about three years. Last time I was there I was on a blind date and that seemed to go over pretty well. Last time I ate there I was vegetarian and had to wait 30-40 minutes for my food, which ended up having chicken in it (even though I asked for no chicken). The meal was free thankfully.

After their recent closure I don't think I will be back... But if you're in a pinch for food in that area it might be alright. Seeing as your only other options on that corner are Burger King, Popeye's or dodgy Chinatown."}
{"text":"I really don't know what has happened to this place but every time I come here, I just dislike it more and more. The first time I came here I absolutely loved this place! The food and service was impeccable. Yet, the past few times I've come here I've had to face horrible and rude service (what happened to the nice servers?!) and mediocre food. Every time I came I just told myself it was an off day but that's clearly not the case. The service was not good at all which just ruins the dining experience for me. I likely won't be returning here."}
{"text":"The red room is a nice place for cheap price I think that is one of the main thing it offers. You can get full pitcher for 11 bucks and it is worth it. The beer is good and the price is unbeatable. For the food I noticed it is decent and mainly not healthy. I ordered the natches and they were fried. The place is decent it is dark with red light which is different than most bars. The washrooms are old but does the jobs

So I guess if your into a place to grab cheap beer this is definitely a place that you should visit."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout with friends. The atmosphere is more like a coffee shop than bar. Drinks are all reasonably priced but not necessarily the best tasting. 

The only thing refraining me from giving this place a higher rating is its cleanliness. Strange stains on their couches and dingy colored walls makes one wonder when was the last time they had a thorough cleaning. Probably a decade ago. Service is also mediocre and they do not do separate bills."}
{"text":"I use to love this place however I had a bad experience there on Saturday night. A few friends and I came after hitting some bars at midnight to grab a bite to eat and have some beers. The waitress (a stubby Caucasian lady) came over and we asked about their beers - she promptly turned a drink menu to us. Then we asked about the shooters they had and she rudely said \"uh like all of them\". Okay. I think part of your job should be to know at least a few of those shooters and beers to recommend to customers. It was apparent she didn't want to be there. 

Later on, the bill came to $46 so my friends put down two twentys and a ten. The waitress came over and said \"you need change?\" and we did not. I did not want my friends to pay for me but I only had a $50 bill with me. She saw that I wanted to pay for my own meal so she came over to me and quickly said \"Your meal was $10, if I give you two twentys (from the pile) and take your fifty, then you have paid for your meal\". Me, being a bit buzzed and tired said \"Sure\" and then she quickly took my fifty AND the ten dollar bill. Right away my friend realized \"You know we tipped her $14 for shitty service right?\" I was appalled - it felt like she manipulated me in order to get $10 more tip. I would be ok with tipping 30% IF the server was friendly and actually made it seem like she wanted to be there but she didn't. The waitress didn't come back with the change. I hate being played so I asked the other waitress there if we could have the change back and I would leave the tip on the table. We then watched as the other waitress talked to our waitress in the corner clearly throwing shade and talking shit about us. And boy, did she take her time getting the change. My friends were \"too prideful\" to stay and wait for the change but I'm quite sure she had no intention of bringing it to us. 

I use to work as a waitress and I NEVER would assume that I could keep the change nor would I ever manipulate customers to tip me more. The next day I called and explained the situation to a worker there and she took my name and number and said she would call back later - she never did. Obviously, a $10 loss isn't a big deal at all (even though I am a poor student). However, I don't like how she manipulated the situation and took advantage of customers. Really disappointing"}
{"text":"I hit this place while on the sangria crawl.  I had the Brie & Avocado sandwich and of course some sangria.  The sandwich was SO GOOD.  It literally melted in my mouth.  They serve it open faced on Texas toast so if you're watching your carbs, best to leave it open faced.  The sangria was good, at least the pitcher our table had.  There seemed to be some inconsistency between pitchers at the different Yelp tables.  

What stopped this from being a 4 star review was the service.  My food came fast but the server barely recognized that I had joined the table late.  I was never asked if I needed anything to drink or if I needed a glass to join in on the sangria pitcher."}
{"text":"meh. the drinks are cheap enough-- not CHEAP but not overpriced. service is basically non-existent. the food? ugh. i ate here and stupidly ordered Pad Thai. It was pad thai noodles with tomato sauce. seriously. ugh. 

also they only accept cash? for such a large bar i really don't understand how they can get away with that. 

basically its a nice central place for U of T students to gather. i'm sure i'll be back a few times, but i won't be eating there again."}
{"text":"Cheap food? Check!
Cheap beer? Check!

I had the avocado & brie sandwich with minestrone that day. Minestrone was meh. Avocado & brie sandwich would have been amazing if it wasn't so oily!  However, you get what you pay for. However, the cheap beer is great? You can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"I went here with friends one night looking for food, which was a mistake because their \"fries with cheese\" (although cheap), didn't exactly turn out to be the smothered gooey potato sticks I'd hoped they be.

Instead they were hunks of hard potato with half melted cheese bit on them. Pretty awful.

And the place was dark! It wasn't a red room at all. It was a friggin' DARK room. And the service is pretty bad too (short staffed more than anything, to be fair).

Would I go back. Yes. But I would go back only if I was thirsty, not hungry."}
{"text":"The worst experience ever.  I highly do not recommend this place.  Servers are not nice AT ALL.  They see us rising our hand up but they straightly ignore us.  Especially some Asian ladies and slim Caucasian guy who wears flannel shirt.  This guy is so bad.  We ordered one pitcher.  We had cracked beer glass, the server is very unfriendly when we asked to replace the glass.  I should say they look always mad.  Also there was hair in the fries. I should have taken picture of it but they just took the plate and threw them away like it wasn't a big deal.  Hair was sticking with fries like couldn't take away from fries.  It was disgusting.  and the worst attitude from the server. When we brought up the issue the server told us \"Your problem is not big as our problem.\" They seem they were having some their own problem but what the worst attitude to the guests.   all he had the audacity to say \"This is so common on all restaurants, it's only a hair...it's not like...\" it's not like what, he couldn't finish his sentence. Seriously No apologies at all.  Then we barely had our beer so we told him that we are leaving then he forced us to pay the pitcher which we haven't even drunk any.   He told us \"your drink and the problem with the fries is a different thing. You don't have to order any food but you can't not leave without paying your drink.\" How come he has that kind of bad attitude?  This restaurant has serious problem with whole service.  Disgusting.  I don't even give them one star but for posting this review I had to.  Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"I think of the Red Room as the big sister/brother to the Green Room.  It's slightly more sophisticated in terms of decor, and easier to access by someone just walking down the street.  The food is tasty and cheap, which I always appreciate.  I always find that if you get here at 10pm or later it's almost impossible to find seating as it is much smaller than the Green Room.   It's a good place to meet up with friends either for dinner and drinks or for a post-dinner drink.  Also a central location between the annex and china town which can be handy.  But,  overall I prefer the Green Room b/c it makes me feel like I'm part of some in-the-know-secret-club, and who doesn't want to feel that way?"}
{"text":"The sign makes it a bit hard to find at night but the amazingly cheap food and drinks plus ALL DAY BRUNCH makes it a win in my book. I got a stuffed french toast with ham and cheese (came with a big side salad & a serving of fries) for $6.00! The portion was so big my friend and I couldn't finish it together. $4 shots also make this place great for a night of celebration. Even all their salads are under $5 - definitely a big inclination to eat healthy for a change :)
Only reason it doesn't get a 5* is that the service wasn't great, the waiters were very nice and everything but they were very understaffed and it took ages to find a waiter to place an order, there were only 2 working on the night I went and the place was pretty busy!"}
{"text":"I will probably never go to the Red Room ever again. 

FOOD
Although the food is cheap, it tasted awful.  Check pic to see what I ate. There are so many other cheap restaurants that serve good food. This place is lucky that U of T is nearby.

STAFF
The wait staff were slow and unresponsive.  
They hinted us to get out of the restaurant way too many times by
1. Asking if there was anything else we needed and before we could answer walked away
2. turning off the lights above us.
This would be ok if they were closing or were really busy but alas, they were not.

BILL
We specifically asked them for separate bills at the beginning the waiter said it could be arranged at the bar at the end of the meal. And then the bar told us, no they cannot split the bill (my ass they can't). Eventually they did after we made a stink about it. And they only take cash. I bet they're sure claiming all the revenue they generate for tax purposes...not.

RED ROOM MATH
Also, they rounded down my change to the nearest dollar and expected us not to notice and keep that change plus whatever tip we gave them. I absolutely hate that. I think it is really rude.

I am giving this place a 2 b/c I saw on the menu cheap drinks and I heard they were decent. Otherwise, this place would get a 1 star rating."}
{"text":"Not an ideal place for reservations.

After making reservations for 25 plus people, the Red Room made the claim that that would be, \"no problem.\"  NO - PROBLEM.  As in, not one little problem.  As if it should be easy.

Look, I understand wanting to seem like you're pleasing everyone, but here's the thing - eventually those people that put in the reservations are going to show up.  And, when you bring them to an alcove that could easily fit 25 people comfortably, they will be pleased.

Now, when you tell them you only have half that space, and they have to cram in, shoulder to shoulder, all the way around, that's less than ideal.

I've never been at a bar where people were yelling to get out, because they were having onsets of claustrophobia... until I visited the Red Room.

It's dark, it's dingy, and it's loud.  And it's cramped...  but only when you make reservations.  The other guests were spread out.  If the whole bar was as cramped as we were, they could have fit twice the people.

There are other locations in this neighbourhood.  If the place isn't cramped, then stop be - but otherwise, grab your friends and go elsewhere.  I'm sure the staff would have \"no problem\" with that."}
{"text":"Have only come here on weekdays for their specials - 4$ drinks! Located on Spadina very close to the University of Toronto campus - it's kind of grungy but it definitely has charm. They also serve some Vietnamese food, in contrast to their pub decor. Lots of character, personable staff!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for a snack. From the outside, the restaurant looks really sketchy. However, the interior was very cute because everything was mismatched in a good way.

The service was a bit slow but I didn't mind it considering the prices on the menu. They have a HUGE selection of food here for a very cheap price! We got fried calamari and wings. The wings were average but the fried calamari really hit the spot.

I would definitely come back here for some cheap eats!"}
{"text":"Ding! It's all in the timing. In life. In going to The Red Room. 

Go ahead, choose a school's in session weekend night. See how that goes. More chairs than square footage within a place crammed full of students and I'm sure, yes, you have something to knit pick. Or go ahead, choose New Year's night. Whether you're a nerd looking to find just the right table, parents catching up with their daughter for a casual dinner, or a three set of friends looking to commiserate in a booth, this is the type of night where the Red Room will surprise you in being a sturdy parliament of wine-sipping that's easy on the dimes. 

Carafe. Wine. A litre. $18. 6+ glasses. 3 people, and I'm a lightweight, so do the math (and you other 2 can go ahead and heel click). On a quiet night there's room enough for a multicultural choir who rolls 14 deep, and a nerd date to pick just the right booth, and for us to spastic-ally spout off vulgar witticisms. Hello, time traveling worm holes you don't have to over think to find! Take that, Hawking. 

Now. You're going to remain skeptical of my positive review of this place. You'll say, what kind of Yelp review doesn't mention food and service. You don't need to care about either of those. You need to care about a booth, more mirrors than a stripper's green room, and the cheapest bottled wine you can find outside of a box. But. Yes. It's all in the timing. In life. In going to The Red Room. Ding!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets so much hate, but then again I mostly only come here for the cheap drinks. 
Sangria pitcher for $17 :))))
The nachos were kind of disappointing, and other than that I haven't tried any of the food nor do I really want to."}
{"text":"Cheap food, cheap drinks, eclectic atmosphere.  It's a chill place to hang out, but don't expect top notch service, food or drinks."}
{"text":"This is one of the cheapest restaurants that i've ever been to in Toronoto.  Plus I've been there on a couple of occasions where they have forgot to bill me for a couple of items that i've ordered making it even cheaper.

The food is an Asian-bar food hybrid, quite bizarre but very cheap and quite average... but cheap.

The beer is cheap, i believe they still do $10 pitchers, and you can even get Sapporo for $12 a pitcher i believe... which is pretty rare.

The atmosphere is very dark, the service is normally pretty poor and chaotic... it doesn't seem like the servers actually have sections and instead just roam around the restaurant serving whatever table seems to require service.

And yes, i did throw up after i ate their the last time.. so it kinda left me with a bitter taste in my mouth... literally."}
{"text":"This restaurant is surprisingly big. It has potential but the one and only time I went, I was meeting a friend for a hot drink and the experience left a lot to be desired. The wait staff neglected us though the restaurant was near empty. We ordered tea and sat at our table for 5 mintute, flabbergasted while we tried to figure out if we were going to be brought our tea bags or if the hand gesture the waitress made meant we had to go get them. Turns out you get your own bag from some mysterious wall. 
I'd give this place a second chance only because of its atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you want to be able to eat and drink for cheap.. this is the place! You can get yourself quite happy on wine for less than $20. It's a bit dingy but that's totally fine.  Happy service, really cheap food, really cheap drinks."}
{"text":"Idk, I felt like I only had an \"ok\" experience here. Only came cause cheap drinks and sangria pitchers on an a Thursday night. 

Their house beer is not bad.. Some of my friends commented that it had a nacho aftertaste LOL but I didn't taste it. Sangria was ok too but I would have preferred more fruit bits in it. 

I felt like the servers were kind of rude (esp. The male) that night..: Maybe because we came as a group of 10? But when we were still looking at the menu, we told the female server we needed a couple more minutes and literally 10 seconds later, we were asked again if we were ready... 

I know it's the holidays but really lame xmas music for a bar haha totally not feeling it. Place is dark but candlelight which is cute. Really ghetto washrooms.... Graffiti everywhere and no paper towels.. Uh hello?! 

Meh."}
{"text":"I don't have one of those \"worst bathrooms\" list created yet on Yelp, but if I did, this place would be on it. They either have a seriously bad plumbing problem going on here or someone had diarrhea in the SINK.

Red Room has the same decor/atmosphere as a few other bars managed by the same people (Green Room, Nirvana, Poor Boy Pub). Random mismatched furniture, weird artwork, low lighting (to hide the dinginess?) Same menu too - really cheap food with menu items ranging from pasta, sandwiches, pad thai and everything in between. Some people obviously seem to like it but I suspect it's only because it's cheap.

Overall, a popular hangout for U of T students but probably not much fun for people over 25."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible food. I mean, how can you possibly screw up nachos and cheese??? Even in trying to give Red Room credit for what it tries to be, (the hip, easy Spadina joint) I am clearly reminded of numerous better choices nearby.
No it is not reminiscent of Green Room and there should definitely be a health inspection in the near future."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite and some cheap beer with some friends one Friday night. The service is completely terrible, mediocre at its best. Our server had a negative attitude the whole night and at one point swore at one of my friends because he had forgotten his ID and the server refused to serve him, even though he is in his 30's. Weird. We also ordered food, I love breakfast, so I ordered pancakes, what a big mistake. The food was sub par along with the decor (courtesy of Ikea) but my friends seem to overlook the horrible service or lack of for some cheap booze. Meh."}
{"text":"Sangria! What is: very often the motivation behind a trip to the Red Room?

So, it may not be the place to go discover new and delectable cuisine, but for students and ex-students alike, the Red Room is something of a hangout, a comfort, an alright place to get something to eat and drink it up. (\"It\" being Sangria).

Now, this Sangria is not the most delicately-flavoured I have ever had, but I have yet to turn it down when offered. The cuisine is perhaps nothing to write home about, but I feel like the finer complexities (or lack thereof) of the food and drink aren't exactly meant to be noticed on their own respective merits. Does that make sense? 

If not, I'll just leave you with what a friend told me when she ordered the Pad Thai and I wondered if I should follow suit, \"It doesn't really taste like Pad Thai, but I still like it- not as Pad Thai, though, just as something else.\" I ordered it anyway and have continued to do so, when the mood for something greasy and --ketchupy?! (REALLY? oh, man...) strikes, cuz I think she was right."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks for an amazing price. Had the best night out here! Our waitress was fun and didn't mind us ordering a bunch of crazy shots. I had their pad Thai which was to die for!"}
{"text":"To my knowledge, The Red Room, Green Room, Java on Queen, and the new Nirvana on College at Bathurst all have the same owners, and essentially the same menu. Or at least the same way of preparing food (usually with ketchup in the Pad Thai, sadly).

And for some reason, the Red Room is the worst of the four. I've had good and bad experiences there, but mostly bad. I heard through the grapevine that the wait staff are told upon being hired that they're allowed to be as rude as they want to customers because the food is cheap. So, naturally, they are very rude. Not cool.

But if I were in court, that would be hearsay, so here's my real evidence: once, at Red Room, my friend found a ladybug in her sandwich. Ew.

Not to mention the place is usually filled with frat boy douche bags and GTA-ers on their way to see \"a friend's band play Battle of the Bands at the El Mo!! Sweet!\"

I say ditch Red Room and walk down to Nirvana at Bathurst -- slightly higher prices but much nicer restaurant, tastier food, a lower percentage of douches, and friendlier staff. And no ladybug sandwiches yet."}
{"text":"Things I love: the pricing and the delicious food.

Things I hate: the pathetic lack of identifiable service and the overly loud environment.

Red Room is loud as all hell, drunk as all hell, and dirty as all hell. The bohemian feel is nice, but bohemian service is sub-par. They lack uniform and coordination, so it is difficult to identify them. The bathroom situation has improved from several years ago, at least.

The food though is really The Red Room's saving grace. Their pad thai with chicken and tofu, though it has one additional \"meat\", still comes under $10. The portion size is fantastic as well; finishing it was a genuine struggle.

The dichotomy between the food and service problematic, though it's a fixable problem. I just doubt it'll even be considered, given it was in this state last time I visited, several years ago."}
{"text":"Dinning at the Red Room is an experience I hope to never repeat.

Three of us arrived slightly later than our party, and right off the bat we were told that separate bills were not possible. He came back five minutes later to remind us again that we could NOT have separate bills (we hadn't even asked for them). Its a cash only, which is fine, but in this modern day and age, options are always appreciated. 

The food was awful. A lot of the food is very clearly brought in already-made, and then fried. They have a very large, very mismatched menu. We saw dishes from Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Mexican, Italian, German and numerous other cultures. I ordered Edamame (over boiled and under salted) and Shrimp Spring Rolls to snack on. One of my shrimp rolls did not have anything in it. It was a hollow, deep friend, roll. My party ordered a variety of different plates, no one was thrilled. 

The waiter seemed to be the only server in the entire restaurant, so I appreciate that he was busy, and might not have been having the best day of his life, so we'll assume the best there.  

And yes....the bathrooms are gross."}
{"text":"Were I only allowed four words to describe the Red Room I'd probably select: sweltering, discombobulated, aloof and dingy. But since I am entitled to more I shall use them. This place kind of blows.

It's located at the northern tip of Chinatown just beside El Mocambo. It's usually filled with U of T students and idiots who don't know where else to take a date. It's not terribly inviting, so the real draws are that it's there and their low-ish priced alcohol.

It's always like a sauna in here no matter what time of year you go, and the layout is so weird, you'll almost always find yourself sliding around chairs and tables if you have more than three friends. The service is virtually non-existent but I think the shitty clientele and darkroom lighting have a lot to do with that. And as for the decor: it's got all the charm of a Dive Bar without actually being one. That's not really a compliment.

I've heard they serve food also, but I can't imagine bringing myself to experiment here with the whole breadth of Chinatown at your feet. Unless I'm on some kind of colour-themed bar crawl (and damn, if I shouldn't throw one) I shan't be back.

Obligatory Title Pun: RED alert.

Menu Readability: I wouldn't know.

Need to mention: OK, they have cheap sangria by the pint. Is that a selling point?

What this place teaches me about myself: I am SO no longer in university."}
{"text":"I only either come here for sangria or breakfast. Sometimes at the same time...nah,  not really. 

I love the Red Room for the chilled out, dark, nicely decorated aspect. The sangria is great, the drinks are well priced. The food is a bit questionable though and the staff aren't the friendliest. But like a lot of people have already mentioned...it's very much a student hang out and I think for that it fulfills its duty. If you're going to make a night of it though, I would suggest walking the extra five minutes to Nirvana. Same owners, way better place :)"}
{"text":"Not digging it. Stopped in here on Sunday just looking for a drink with a companion. We were seated quickly. However, it took a while for someone just to take our order. I ordered a sangria and my companion a lite beer. Then we waited even longer to get the drinks, and it wasn't happening. We asked another waitress how long it would be, and she had no idea, but also made fun of how incompetent the servers and bartenders were. We saw multiple other people wait even less than us, and give up and leave. We finally got up and left because it just wasn't worth it. We went to a very close bar instead called Einstein's, where we received very nice and prompt service and great drinks. I've been to multiple restaurants in Toronto, and some are better than others, but this is the first downright awful restaurant I've been to. We will never return."}
{"text":"The sangria at Red Room was cheap ($16.50/pitcher) but that's probably owing to the fact that it's inconsistently mixed and has hardly any alcohol in it. My group was scattered amongst four different tables and everyone's sangria looked different. Some was light red, some was concentrated, some had carbonation (club soda, 7UP) and some had none. 

Also, I hesitated before ticking off \"YES\" to \"Waiter Service\" as it's so scarce you sometimes wonder if Red Room is self serve. 

Still, it's an OK place to meet larger groups and have cheap food. Just don't expect to be in and out in a jiff."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever received I couldn't believe it. I came here yesterday for drinks and food  and left before ordering. We were ready and my friend asked for the waiter (bartender) as he was walking by and he turned to my friend and lashed out saying \"can you give me a minute?!?\" With the rudest tone and facial expression. It was unbelievable! Would not return ever. I also want to note that the restaurant was NOT busy. There were only a few tables that had people including us."}
{"text":"On the weekdays I love this place. My server is great, she remembers my order and treats me like an old friend. The problem has been every weekend I've come here. I've tried to give it a few shots. One particular server, Jessi, is awful. She has gotten my order wrong (I have an allergy) twice, which meant everyone in my party ate and I had to take mine to go. She has overcharged me and added a 15% gratuity on my bill when I dined alone. She really has to go. The wait staff here are so hit and miss. I'll probably still go back for my regular server who is awesome!"}
{"text":"$18 for a litre of wine. Wine from a bottle and not a box? Let that sink in. That's practically zero mark up. 

Was it the best wine ever? No. Was it totally drinkable? Yes. Did we get a second litre? Yes. Since there were three of us, I feel this is OK. Not great... but it was the holidays. 

The pad Thai here is generally liked by students, but as a grown up I only go for the cheap drinks here. I'm really mature."}
