{"text":"Love this place, I always get half a tuna  melt and side salad, it's the best lunch around! I would suggest calling ahead though because around lunch time it gets very busy!"}
{"text":"AWESOME!!

I came here while visiting CMU, and I was blown away! Service was exemplary, and the food was great! I got the California Club, and it quite good.

A good, casual cafe atmosphere: great for studying!

Would definitely become a regular here if I come to CMU!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's unique about this place. It certainly doesn't live up to any standard of local or innovative food, but it has some pretty tasty stuff.

I had a Cobb Salad and a pumpkin bar/muffin thing. The pumpkin sweet? Awesome. I want to know how to make it myself.

The Cobb salad was ok--lots of cheddar cheese, tasty shredded chicken, nice well-done bacon, and a hardboiled egg. All that was good. The guacamole was not fresh (tasted like the premade grocery store crap), which is a disappointment considering that guacamole is probably the easiest dish on the planet to make (avocado, salt, and a fork...where can it go wrong). I was left wanting a piece of bread with my salad.

I also didn't like the plastic container it was served in. Those things activate my feelings of enviro-guilt. I would have preferred a ceramic or even paper plate and some metal utensils. However, the air conditioning was very welcome on a hot day so I'll forgive them for plastic.

I will probably return for more pumpkin goodies, but I doubt the sandwiches and salads will bring me back."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh we have no shortage of delicious, locally owned restaurants, as you can see from the loads of reviews posted here.  But, these are mostly sit-down with entr√©es and service, best for dinner.  When it comes to lunchtime, 'burghers are often at the mercy of national chains like Subway, Quizno's, McDonald's, Qdoba, Chipotle, etc.  Don't get me wrong, those chains have a place and a time (maybe), but I want more from my lunch.  Where's all the delis in this town anyway?  There's not enough!  Not enough, I tell you!  But I'm on the hunt, and for no particular reason, my first stop is Eat Unique.  It may not be fast, or particularly cheap, but their sandwiches are eponymously creative, and when they are good they are eminently satisfying.

The food here is by and large tasty.  They've got all the standard lunch fair: soups, salads, cold sandwiches, hot sandwiches, coffee, tea, and bakery items.  These offerings are sometimes just straight up classics, like a Reuben or BLT, but often there is a slight twist.  So... tomato soup with feta.  Or a chicken sandwich, Hawaiian style.  Or a meatloaf melt with blue cheese and BBQ sauce.  This is the kind of place where you'll find golden raisins instead of regular, lots of different kinds of bread (toasted and grilled),  and spring greens, balsamic vinaigrette, pesto, and banana peppers as regular toppings.  Oh, and of course they have wraps.  In this century, everyone has to sell a wrap, lest they be mistaken for an old-person restaurant or someplace located in a state like Arkansas or Idaho.  (And even they have wraps now!  And smoothie huts!  The world, it is a changin'...)

So they get bonus points for their consistent attempts at sandwich originality.  I have to warn you, though, sometimes the sandwich does not quite pull together like you'd imagine.  For example, the day I noticed the Hawaiian style chicken sandwich I immediately had all sorts of hopes and dreams for how it would solve many of my lunch, life, and also the world's problems.  I thought, based on the description it must be the most amazing delightful sandwich in history. C'mon: Chicken salad topped with crushed pineapple, roasted red peppers, and shredded provolone cheese; baked in a sour dough sub roll, garnished with field greens and balsamic vinaigrette?  Sounds frickin' awesome, right?  Sadly, it just doesn't live up.  For me.  Especially for $7.  Something about the sourdough-provolone interaction, or the pineapple-balsamic combo...

But that's just me. Mostly you have to try a lot of different things to find what appeals to you here.  And you should definitely give it more than one chance because there are loads of really delicious things.  I lovvvve the fresh mozzerella baguette.  It reminds me of this Bread Salad stuff I make at home sometimes, and also is reminiscent of the best bruschetta of my life, at a dinky pizza place called Gigi's in Jensen Beach, FL, where ostensibly the owner has three balls, as in testicles (note: I have not personally verified the accuracy of this statement with my own two hands... yet).  But I digress, at Eat Unique, I also love that if I just want a little soup, I can get a cheap hunk of baguette to eat it with.  I also love that they have the most AMAZING herbal iced tea ever, only one available at a time, on rotation (currently a delicious Blood Orange, but it used to be the most amazing Peppermint).  And I love that they have Chocolate Chip and Sea Salt cookies.  People definitely do not appreciate this sweet and salty combination of flavors nearly enough.  You gotta dip your fries in your Frosty if you want to experience life!

So Eat Unique is going to stay put, for a while I am sure.  It doesn't always live up, but it does most of the time, and for that reason I will always be their customer.  Plus they have a really giant eating area now, which is much improved from the early years (though I wish they'd fix the ordering and pick-up area, which is annoyingly cramped and confusing for everyone involved).  Moreover, this place is excellent for vegetarians, who can find the same sandwich creativity extended towards all-veg fare.  If you are in Oakland on the CMU end of things, or are planning a trip to the Carnegie, and want an interesting and probably pretty good lunch in the 'deli'-ish category, you should definitely try this place.  It all around qualifies as good.

GET:
Iced tea
Fresh Mozz Baguette is my current pick
Soups

UNDERWHELMING:
Hawaiian Chicken Sub
Sweet Bean Hummus Sandwich      (I was very sad about this; I really wanted this to be the best ever!!)

SNEAKY TIP:
The lunch hours are ridiculously slow here, and to be honest, the non-lunch hours are still ridiculously slow.  If you are at all pressed for time, do NOT order something from the grill.  In fact you may be best off not 'ordering' anything at all and instead getting one of their pre-packed things to go, like a salad, or phoning in your order ahead of time, or going after 2pm."}
{"text":"very tasty and healthy food

cant get enough of their malibu avocado burger or their mushroom melt"}
{"text":"Review is only based on cookies and service.

I have only tried their vegan cookies (ginger molasses and snickerdoodle) and let me just say that those are very tasty! Not too sweet, and honestly, you wouldn't even be able to tell that they're vegan. 

Every cashier that I've seen so far has been kind and smiley. Shout out all cashiers who put effort into their jobs!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. They yell orders in your face. Salad sucked and was overpriced. Whole place feels unwelcoming. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"Nothing special but there is ample seating room. I had the half sandwich and soup. It was kind of pricy for what it was so I dont think I will be back."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are great, especially pesto chicken sandwich and tomato blue melt. I also enjoy their tomato soup but find it too salty sometimes. I wish they would improve their interior and provide more seating."}
{"text":"Great options for vegans and vegetarians!
I love their garden chili, tomato feta basil and special vegan soups with lentils.
Their burgers are awesome - Zesty pineapple and Chipotle black bean burger are awesome, but expensive. You can make these burgers yourself, as the patties are commercially available in costco/trader joes.
Tex Mex Taco salad is my fav among the salads - enough protein and everything!
I'm not a big fan of cold sandwiches, so I can't tell. Although, I would say, their very veggie sandwiches are balanced and have a lot of protein. I love that they have half sandwich/half soup option, but I really don't feel like eating sandwiches all the time.
Mushroom melt is another one of fav!
Their daily special herbal ice teas are great! I have them during summer and they are very refreshing. 
Overall, if you don't mind the expense, it is a great place for seasonal lunch or desserts!"}
{"text":"The only other choices you have if you want a sandwich in the area are Quiznos and Subway, so they have an advantage right there, but they're still pretty looks - there's some nice soup options and they have a pretty decent vegetarian menu as well. Some things I like here are the Pesto Chicken Sandwich, the Southwest Sizzler and the Summer Sandwich."}
{"text":"Delicious. If they were open later, I might have a serious problem because I'd go there all the time!

The food is local and they have a lot of vegetarian options as well as organic.

The tomato, basil and feta soup is out of this world amazing. The chicken ranch griller is soooo good. I have had their portabella mushroom sandwich is really good too.

The food is so fresh, this is hands down the best place in town if you're craving a fresh and homemade soup and sandwich."}
{"text":"Their double chocolate brownies don't look particularly great at first glance, but don't be fooled--they are among the best I've ever tasted. Warning: they are addictive :) Love eat unique for quick sandwiches and soups."}
{"text":"Meh. The ingredients are not very high quality. I used to think this was the only place to get lunch around CMU but I've definitely branched out since then. The guac gets squeezed out of a bag and apparently their black bean burgers are just morning star burgers. Everything is just overpriced for semi-ok food."}
{"text":"Whatever haters, this place is great.

As someone who has certain dietary needs and preferences, I usually have to find a few solid \"go-to\" spots for affordable food. Having lived in California most of my life, I value a vegetable-heavy meal, especially for the right price, and that can be more difficult to find in this otherwise lovely city.

So thank you Eat Unique, for consistently supplying me with a hearty, healthy option on a tight budget. Your fresh meal-sized salads for under $7? You are awesome. Your chicken chili with chard and corn in it for $4 and some change? OMG I love you. 

If y'all want to talk about crappy sandwiches, go across the street for an overpriced bagel, or better yet, hit up Panera (ew). But if you want delicious fresh food, a big selection, and not feel robbed? I'd totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"Favorite place to go to lunch in North Oakland. Never have had a bad experience here, except the wait can be long if you go at a peak time. Great array of vegetarian options, nice to pick up or stay for a casual lunch. I love the summer sandwich and the roasted vegetable wrap. During Lent, they serve the most amazing mac and cheese on Fridays (make sure to get sriracha with it). Great selection of tea and very reasonably priced. Would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great food, awful service, a sandwich takes about 25 min to make. I recommending eating here but call in."}
{"text":"Just because you are unique does not mean you are good.
I've been to Eat Unique about ten times in the last year and those experiences were bad to mediocre.  The food is fine, but everything else about the place is annoying.
-Your half sandwich, half soup options are limited to the most boring sandwiches on the menu.  I understand that not all sandwiches halve well, but this seems like a cheap trick to force the customer to buy a whole sandwich when they only want a half with their soup.  If you read my other reviews, you'll note that this sort of upselling gimmick is a huge pet peeve of mine.  
-The area in front of the register is always crowded with fidgety hungry people scrutinizing the four-digit numbers on their receipts and waiting for their food.  There's a second register behind all these people, but it's difficult to see and even more difficult to reach.
-The decor is well-painted dinginess.  The demeanor of the staff waffles between deadpan and morose, probably because they're tired telling customers that they can't order the half sandwich they want with soup.  The water fountain is a weird little sink.  The tables wobble.  
It's like they're not even trying to be a good restaurant and are thriving on the low standards of craig st diners (myself included).  I will praise their southwest sizzler, and turkey chili as very solid (and, dare I say, \"unique\") culinary offerings, but most of what I've had there has been boring and overpriced."}
{"text":"Best soup around.  Add a few pieces of soup bread and you have a filling lunch.  If they have the back register open, head straight to that one and order your soup - they'll hand it right to you.  For sandwiches (some yummy ones!), I call ahead to minimize wait.  Ready to pick up when I get there from my office.  Buy your coffee down the street, EatUnique's isn't great (probably why they changed their name from Craig Street Coffee to EatUnique a few years back)."}
{"text":"Pretty good. It was a little on the expensive side (at least on my scale), but luckily it's compatible with local college meal plans, which is awesome! I got the half-and-half, a sandwich and tomato soup. Portions were slightly smaller than what I'd have liked, and the iced chai tea latte (although very good) was filled mostly with ice. Would be an easy five stars if there was more food product for my dollar. Still, I'll definitely be back whenever I'm in want of some clean, fresh food instead of greasy dining hall food."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Very close to Carnegie Mellon. Had the California Club - delish! Thick slab of chicken and a really unique sauce, on bread that tasted like pizza dough. Bright green and peach walls and tables- cute little place. Wish they had fountain drinks, but they will give you a cup of ice."}
{"text":"I needed a quick lunch and stopped in here. I wasn't adventurous, just a turkey and provolone on multi-grain bread, but it was fresh and delicious. I also got a big ginger cookie, nice and chewy. Staff were friendly and helpful. I went right at lunch time, so it was crowded and busy, but that's to be expected. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I feel like the lone dissenter, here, but the food at this place has been consistently terrible every time I've been in. Every 3-4 months I think to myself \"Well, maybe I hit them on an off day, last time.\" Stupid Craig Street and its convenient location! 

Seriously, though, even my grilled cheese sandwich tasted bad--how do you mess up a grilled cheese sandwich?

And their coffee is too weak.

I agree with the person who said it's cute inside. I think that's why I've given them so many chances. But food that's just not that good--combined with high prices--means I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Love, love, love their turkey chili--even more than mine!  Gazpacho was fresh and bright--and as good as mine ;-) great prices for hearty, unique salads, soups and sandwiches. Also had a piece of my daughter's some sort of green tea cookie, I honestly can't stop thinking about it!!  It was crispy on the edges and soft in the middle, and sweet and salty at the same time--so delish!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place so many times, but never got to stop in until today.  Always hard to find parking here since its right in between CMU and Pitt's campus.  The Parking Gods were on my side today as they parted the parallel parking sea for me.  
I heard they had good sandwiches, but I thought there was a waiter service.  Its more of a deli counter style where they call your number when its ready.  Nothing fancy.  And WoW does one of the girls have some strong vocal cords. Good for a quick lunch break or dinner before your class.  Prices were reasonable.  I had the Meatloaf sandwich.  Great for a chilly day.  The sauce, blue cheese, and bacon on top definitely set it off.  I'm going to be craving this bad boy for a while.  My BF had the Tuna Melt.  It was very good as well, but you better be a fan of banana peppers.  If you are like me, and usually drink water over soda pop, the free water you have to get yourself.  I did not know this.....so I was standing there waiting until I was pointed to the self serve area with tiny styro cups and tiny sink for tap water.  No ice. I understand the water is free, so I'm not asking for much.  But when you are eating a heavily seasoned Meatloaf Sandwich......you are going to be thirsty enough to put down 4-5 of those cups.  So either A. Come prepared with your own cup, B. Spring for a $ bottle of water, or C. get some exercise getting up and down to get water and work off your Meatloaf Sandwich."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. The prices were always a bit on the pricey side, but the food was worth it. Now, they've reduced the quality and amount of food you get. 

The last time I went I paid $7.50 for a small salad. When they gave it to me the small container was only half full!! I was so upset that I had just paid $7.50 for a few pieces of lettuce. Go to Panera, at least you get a lot more food for your money."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I think I've had it with Eat Unique. Being stuck in the restricted options of North Craig Street I've been a customer at Eat Unique a number of times. The food is fine, nothing special. A couple sandwiches are better than average, a couple worse. Overall it is overpriced for what you get. 

But let's get to the real problem: this place is a terribly run restaurant. My experience today is rather typical. I go in and order at sandwich to carry out at about 2:30pm. So it's after the lunch rush and not extremely busy. And I wait for 14 minutes for my sandwich!! While I'm waiting I start to fume a bit as I make some observations. I count NINE employees currently working (and maybe more in the back I couldn't see). That's a heck of a lot of staff for a soup and sandwich shop with no table service that isn't even that busy. 

But here's the real kicker: I counted SEVEN tickets while I was waiting. That means there were two more people working than there were orders, and it still took me 14 minutes to get a sandwich. There is something very wrong with that. Most of the problem was obvious, the majority of the staff seemed to be wandering around behind the counter not exactly sure what they were doing, not at a particular assigned station, and moving really quite slowly on whatever task they were attempting to figure out. It's sandwiches, not haute cuisine. It should be fast, efficient, and good. And just because the staff looked mostly like college kids and 20 somethings is no excuse. The campus pub I used to work at was all 19year olds in the kitchen and with a little training, three of them could crank out solid food at about five times the rate of Eat Unique with a much more complex menu including a flattop and fryer. 

My suggestion to the owners/managers: fire half your staff (which should allow you to lower your prices), and get 3-4 solid line cooks that know what they're doing and how to work in a kitchen. I guarantee your business will improve when people don't have to wait 20min for a sandwich and a cup of soup."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick lunch with a lot of variety in their regular menu and a changing menu of specials. Soups are generally good and have the bonus of not taking very long (waits can be on the long-side during peak lunch hours). I'm a fan of the sweet bean hummus sandwich as well as the regular hummus sandwich. It's nothing amazing, but a nice solid reasonably priced lunch. Hot sandwich specials have always been hit or miss for me and tend to err on the side of being super greasy rather than super flavorful."}
{"text":"Eat Unique has some really good vegetarian options. Their Mushroom Melt, Southwest Sizzler, and especially their Summer Sandwich, are all delicious, and fairly reasonably priced to boot. They also have a nice selection of cookies and teas. They also have several seasonal options which are also quite good."}
{"text":"Food is great, very fresh and tasty. The soup selection is wonderful.   The set up of Eat Unique is awful. Long lines out the door and wait times for hot food during lunch are unbearable.  

I suggest calling ahead.  You will be in and out in a flash."}
{"text":"Expansive menu, great veggie and meat lover's options. Fresh soup of the day and Mel specials to mix it up a bit. I love their daily stand by of the White Chicken Chili. Hearty and has a bit of a kick to it. Black bean burger is the bomb, minus the goopy cheese. The sweet bean hummus was a wonderful surprise on a recent sandwich I had. 

Sometimes, I feel that it is a bit expensive for say a lunch meal but as the hubby. has pointed out, it us comparable in pricing to Panera, and much better. 

The desserts are not the goopy kind full of thick icing or heavy cream. Instead, large Sea Salt and Choco Chip cookies, Pumpkin bars, Thick and just a bit dry (the way I like 'em) Shortbread cookies adorn the dessert case.

I like the adventure of going here. Trying new combos of ingredients is always a treat when you trust the culinary integrity of a place, like I do of Eat Unique"}
{"text":"Eat unique has plenty of fresh offerings. The sandwiches are well-thought out and well-executed. Here's an example: I once got a wrap with fresh strawberries, goat cheese, fresh baby greens, chicken, and I think balsamic vinaigrette. It was perfect and light for summer time. And it went perfectly with crisp ice tea. The portions are a good size (some might argue its a bit on the small size).

Its fairly crowded during lunchtime though. And because of this, service can be very very slow. I've waited for 30-40 min once for a sandwich. I know I'm not the only one because another customer at the time had to leave before she could get her sandwich. We got refunds though. I think they might be understaffed during lunch hours.

Their iced coffee is very nice. It's deep, rich, and nutty. I might put a little cream in, but its pretty tasty on its own."}
{"text":"Good food and often good desserts, but can be a little bit pricey. For example, for $7 you get a sandwich, with nothing."}
{"text":"My friends are probably exasperated with me because I won't shut up about how delicious the brownie I bought here was - seriously, it was a brick of chocolate happiness, and MASSIVE (...and I am not one to shy away from hefty desserts). I should have stopped halfway through and couldn't, but I think it was worth the stomachache. 

The taco salad with vegan chili was tasty (although the large percentage of tortilla chips kindof made me feel like I was eating nachos grande, detracting from the healthy factor..), and I'm really excited to try the other vegetarian options on their menu."}
{"text":"everything is amazing but... their chicken pesto sandwich is the addicting omg!!! Like I eat every bite slowly just so I can enjoy every second of it before it's done. i probably have it 5 times a week. go try it!!!"}
{"text":"The food is just good, especially the soups.  I would happily endure the pain if I could swim in a vat of their white turkey chili.  The sandwiches, likewise, are tasty and consistent.  Lately, my go-to is the Cobb salad.  

My big issue with Eat Unique is that the service is consistently slow, slow, slow.  More often than not, I have to weigh how much I want their turkey chili with how long I'm willing to wait.  There have been days when I've had to wait 45 minutes for soup and a sandwich--not convenient if you have a limited lunch break."}
{"text":"Everything here tastes great and is pretty healthy. It's also one of the only organic-like restaurants in the Oakland area. It's a little more expensive than going to Subway or Quiznos, but worth it every now and then. I'd recommend the soups; the vegan options are great and yummy. The soup and sandwich combo feels like a good bang for your buck too. I'd recommend the hummus sandwich or California chicken or avocado chicken. The desserts are AMAZING, too. Definitely would recommend the lemon bar most of all. Yum.

Only complaint is that the wait is a little long for a grab and go."}
{"text":"First visit, but definitely not my last.  The white bean chilli was excellent and the chicken salad sandwich was flavorful and tasty.  It was busy, but worth the wait. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"COOKIES! I'm on a search for Pittsburgh's best cookies. While I still have more exploring to do, these are the best cookies that I've found so far. They are big, chewy, and delicious. I always get the sea salt chocolate chip. They have a lot of other baked goods as well. I'm glad I only work a couple blocks away from here. They have pretty good coffee and I like to get it there instead of Starbucks. I've only had food here a couple times. I was satisfied with it. It's like a better, local alternative to Panera. It's a little pricey. I've had a turkey club and a hummus and vegetable sandwich. Both were delicious. Customer service is always great."}
{"text":"I'm never eating here again. Despite my love for their pesto chicken sandwich, I ordered a soup because I thought it would be fast but for some reason my order got lost and it still took 25+ minutes. It's so slow. There's no organization and they're all just lost. It still took 20 minutes for me to even get my latte. I have an hour lunch break and shouldn't spend 45 minutes 1) before I even get to order and 2) to get it."}
{"text":"Portions are small but then so am I. I made a pledge that this would be my lunch place this summer (2008) so three or four times a week I walk over to Eat Unique from campus (Carnegie Mellon) and grab me some soup. Occasionally I get the soup & sandwich combo, but mostly just soup. It's great soup and a nice light lunch. The Tomato-Feta soup is my favorite, the White Turkey Chili is also great. The Southwest Sizzler or the Sweet Bean Hummus are probably the best sandwiches. Lots of veggie options!"}
{"text":"This sandwich shop reminded me of a more intimate Panera Bread. They have sandwiches made to order and pastries on display as well. There are plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. Prices are reasonable and sandwiches are tasty! The order area was a bit cramped and I waited for a good 15 minutes for my sandwich. The employees are super friendly though. There are plenty of seats, both downstairs and upstairs. I will definitely be back to try the rest of their menu. I recommend this place for those in the Oakland area needing a quick lunch or a place to meet up with old pals."}
{"text":"I like their black bean burgers a lot."}
{"text":"Eat Unique has a great menu full of unique sandwiches and salads that leaves Panera in the dust. I finally made it out to the cafe for lunch today and had an overall good experience.

The only negative part of my lunch was that my girlfriend asked for American cheese on her sandwich rather than the normal bleu cheese. They ended up giving her a corner of a piece of American as well as bleu cheese. It's a shame that they couldn't get such a simple request right, especially since we arrived at 1:30 and the lunch crowd was gone. I also ordered a pecan bar and did not receive it, I went back to the cashier and she gave me one. Reading similar negative comments regarding accuracy with ordering makes me think it's something they should work on.

The food was excellent, however. I got the Italian sub and it was full of fresh spring greens rather than the usual shredded ice berg lettuce. I also tried their white turkey chili and it was excellent as well.
My girlfriend managed to pick most of the bleu cheese off of her meatloaf melt and said it was really good. She also had the tomato feta and basil soup and enjoyed it.

The pecan bar was a flaky crust, a kind of dense chocolate ganache and a pecan topping similar to a pecan pie. It was really good.
The food at Eat Unique seems to be fresh and in plentiful portions. We'd definitely go back. I hope they get their ordering accuracy in better shape, though."}
{"text":"True to its name, the food here is indeed pretty unique. Definitely a nice place and convenient place to have so close to campus. They have an awesome selection of vegetarian options. I usually get the summer sandwich along with a soup or a bag of chips. I accidentally ordered something non-vegetarian once, and the lady at the counter was nice enough to replace that with something vegetarian for me free of charge. A pretty regular lunch/dinner spot while I am still in CMU."}
{"text":"My only regret about this place is that I never came here when I was a student. It was so good!

Yes, the check-out space wasn't designed very well and often results in human traffic jams. Yes, the food costs more than you'd want it to here. But c'mon: EVERY place costs more than I want it to, and as someone else pointed out: Eat Unique's prices compare to Panera's, only Eat Unique's food tastes even better (and I say this as a solid Panera fan). There's a ton of seating options in here, too, so before you complain, just think about how many fewer tables there may have been if they knocked out a wall to try and expand the line area.

I had the Grilled Pesto Chicken sandwich during my first visit in an effort to avoid some of the \"unhealthier\" options on the menu and have to say, I was very, very pleased. It's very rare that I get a sandwich that perfectly balances toppings and meat; usually I get too much of one or the other. Plus, the toppings were crisp and fresh, and the chicken well cooked. Not the juiciest chicken ever but not dry by any means. It was right on, it hit the spot, and it left me feeling satisfied and yet ready for more. 

Don't worry: I was good and opted to keep the place in mind for another day, rather than pig out on a second sandwich. I am already excited to come back and try many, many more options on the menu, including the veggie and the beef and brie sandwiches. I may eventually get to the soup and salad options, but those sandwiches, man...they're calling to me!"}
{"text":"GET THE PECAN BAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If there's a day you are craving sweets, get the pecan bar!!!!!!!! It's sad how they don't have it everyday, so I need to pray before I go in. But definitely a must-try with their black coffee it's the perfect combo."}
{"text":"I have to applaud Eat Unique for trying to bring healthy food to a city known for its French fries salads. That said, my visit left much to be desired. I went with my boyfriend during one of our short-lived health kicks. He got some chicken sandwich that wasn't bad, but just kind of mediocre. My hummus sandwich, on the other hand, may have been the worst hummus I've had in recent memory. Just as I never understand why Pad See Ew is sugary sweet in some Thai restaurants,  I will never understand why the hummus at Eat Unique tasted like it was full of sugar instead of tahini. I have a sweet tooth the size of Canada, but hummus should never be as sweet as it was at Eat Unique."}
{"text":"Really does have unique season items that are healthy and tasty so much so that a non-health food guy like me enjoys
Pretty miraculous!"}
{"text":"Tasty sandwiches including a lot of vegetarian options.  Service isn't fast and ambiance isn't great, but a good healthy option near the universities."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent flier here. Good sandwiches and salads, they're definitely \"unique\". Some of my favorite items include the chef salad, the white bean turkey chili, and almost any of their chicken sandwiches. The baked goods are also yummy. I think there prices are a bit high for some of their more basic dishes. They also always take forever to get your order out, regardless of time of day and how many people are working. Also the place could use a good floor cleaning in the dining room."}
{"text":"The food is excellent - the soups are amazing (especially the Garden Chili and Tomato Basil Feta soup), there are some awesome sandwiches (Autumn Griller, Southwest Sizzler, Sweet Bean Hummus.) The muffins are baked fresh and the owner/baker, Dave, is a genius with these.

The staff in general seems to be good at what they do. Only real issue is sometimes the staff is hard pressed to keep up with demand, so things get slow. It seems like this may be an issue of kitchen size though.

The portions are somewhat small compared to most restaurants, which are ridiculously large, and at lunch time the place can get packed. Go outside peak hours to minimize the wait."}
{"text":"This deli/cafe rocks!  I had the chicken noodle soup and the Southwest Sizzler, and I thoroughly enjoyed both.  There are vegetarian options on the menu.  The ingredients used are top notch."}
{"text":"Listen haters - I hear you that the layout of this place blows. Totally get that. Eat Your Feet.

I've also had some sub- par sandwiches here, but on the whole, they're definitely solid. One thing I'll say is that the hummus sandwich is a bit small - \"piled high with veggies\"? Yeah, not really. Might as well order the BLTTA so you can Eat Your Meat

But on the whole I love this place. TOMATO FETA BASIL SOUP. Got it once, now I get it every time. A fantastic item. The sonoma wrap, great choice. Grilled Cheese, pretty good. Its not a five star, but definitely more than just average."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are really fresh and tasty. A lot better than most of the other sandwich place. I can only recommend trying it out yourself. Decent prices, too."}
{"text":"20 Minutes to make a sandwich. 
Saw person making it cough on it while they were cooking it. 
Was in the bathroom for 2hrs after eating here, sick. So was my mother and so were all of my friends who have eaten here. Super greasy. Not bad tasting though."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here, and I had a much better experience once I branched out and tried something new on the menu (I'm a picky eater).  I'm a student at Carnegie Mellon so Eat Unique is great location wise and price wise. 

I ordered the white chili and the chicken pesto sandwich with gouda.

Both were delicious but so filling, I should've ordered just one thing!

The chili is thick, but really yummy, a little spicy (but I have low tolerance for spicy).  Unfortunately, for both me and my friend, the woman who took our order messed up for the both of us when it came to the sizes of our chili orders.  I ended up taking my chili home, and it tastes just as yummy when microwaved a few hours later!

The chicken pesto sandwhich was absolutely wonderful.  I'm not big on vegetables or pesto that tastes what I call too \"green\", so this pesto was really good.  Not too raw tasting.  The chicken was really good and fresh.  I really liked the bread that the sandwich is made on, but not quite sure what the name of it is.  The only thing is that the pesto was a little oily, so the sandwich kept dripping as I ate and the chicken kept sliding around.  

Overall, I am now a much bigger fan of Eat Unique!"}
{"text":"Very nice. Pastrami melt and mushroom barley soup.
  Yum."}
{"text":"I have been to Eat Unique quiet a few times for lunch and I have never been disappointed.  Ingredients are always fresh and the service fairly fast. Definitely a good option for a quick lunch but you can also go there for a longer lunch with your friends, since the dining space is nice and spacious.  There is also some limited  outdoor sitting for the summer time.  

My absolute favorite is the summer sandwich, while I highly recommend the tuna salad as well.  However, whatever I have tried is very good, so I do not think you can really go wrong with any option.  Only reason I am giving it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 is the fact that it is just a sandwich place (although a really good one)."}
{"text":"GET THEIR BAKED GOODS. My favorite is the lemon bar... ahhh lemon-y goodness with a perfect crumbly crust. I've also tried their GF snickerdoodle cookie, walnut brownies, and regular brownies and they're all pretty good. They also have a matcha white chocolate brownie, which is a little bit TOO sweet for my taste, but perfect for others. Their baked goods (specifically the lemon bar) tends to disappear by mid afternoon, so get there early.

One star down because I'm not a huge fan of their food. They have a ton of options for people who have gluten allergies, are dairy free or are vegetarian/vegan so props to them, but nothing shouts \"OMG\" to me.

TIP: Their baker doesn't come in on Sunday so by then.. most of the sweets are either gone or a day old. :("}
{"text":"This was my second time in eat unique. They have a very high footfall during lunch time mainly from people at Cmu. So it's crowded and you've to wait for quite some time after you place the order. They however do have a good variety of vegetarian sandwiches. Although I'm a non vegetarian I eat the veg sandwiches in eat unique because they really are that unique and interesting. Today we tried a zesty pineapple sandwich which was pretty yummy. We also ordered a hummus and avocado sandwich which was a little dry but it tasted fine. Their sandwiches are very filling, even the vegetarian ones."}
{"text":"The food I've had here has been pretty good -- mostly I've had their salads which seem fresh and tasty. The prices are a bit high for a lunch spot, but it's not a bad option once in a while. This appears to be one of the healthier places on Craig Street."}
{"text":"Am vegan with gluten free lifestyle. There were many items on their menu that I loved. We had pumpkin pear vegetarian gluten free soup which was yum! Had many sandwich options and we loved zesty pineapple sandwich. Will visit again"}
{"text":"If you want a place to eat a good sandwich AND catch up on Pitt sorority/fraternity gossip, have I got the place for you!  
I came here twice during a quick trip to PGH, once for dinner and once for lunch.  For dinner I had the mushroom melt, recommended to me by the cashier, and got it to go.  Little did I know what gossip I may have missed by this decision!  I ate the sandwich in my hotel room while watching Friends reruns.  Not. The. Same.  (The sandwich, btw, was fantastic.  As was the pumpkin cookie I got with it.)
The next day (a Sunday), I couldn't think of a lunch option I wanted more, so I returned, this time getting a \"fresh mozz baguette.\"  Saying \"mozz\" instead of mozzarella kind of weirds me out, but it's not them, it's me.  The sandwich was great.  This time I ate in, in the little room behind the ordering area.  This was both the best and worst decision I made while at Eat Unique.  Because I didn't know it at the time, but a nearby table had two hungover sorority girls, dishing about a party they'd gone to the night before.  I was both riveted and disgusted for the rest of my meal.  Recommended."}
{"text":"The chilly, rainy weather today put me in the mood for some nice hot homemade soup. However, it also deterred me from going to the Strip to get it, so I decided to head down the street instead to Eat Unique.

I must admit that after having picked up an unimpressive sandwich (don't remember which) from here a couple of years ago before a trip, I'd been hesitant to patronize this place again.  Having reviewed other Yelpers' comments, I decided to opt for a small tomato basil feta soup and the pesto chicken sandwich, which came to slightly over $10 together.  Because I went today (Sat.), it wasn't very busy, and I didn't encounter any confusion or hostility when ordering.  After ordering, my food took about 5 min. to prepare. Since I live nearby, I took it back to my apt. to consume.

The tomato soup, which was reasonably warm, although not quite as hot as I'd like it, was pretty good, albeit not mind-blowing.  The sandwich was solidly okay, and not as flavorful as I would have liked, esp. for something containing pesto.  Although it stayed together fairly well, the ingredients slid around a fair bit, and it cooled off pretty quickly, to the point that I put the second half in the microwave before eating it.

While the food was solidly okay, esp. for deli food in PGH, I've had better.  I prefer to patronize independent local businesses over chains, but I'd say the food is a step up from Subway, but doesn't quite meet the standard of the food at Panera."}
{"text":"I AM TRULY BAFFLED AT THIS YELP RATING. I AM IN LOVE AND OBSESSED. Though, I've only been here once for lunch, I will most definitely be back. I had the summer sandwich (mozzarella, tomatoes, pesto) and if was sooo tasty. Their drinks are so delightful as well. A must try in the Oakland area for healthy and delicious food."}
{"text":"I'm not trying to knock this place in any way, but I was not impressed at all.  First off, I did not dine in here, I called in an order and stopped to pick it up.  The space itself is unique, very colorful, and definitely not like any other place I have been in the city.  

The order I called in was a rather larger order so I expected that there would be a little wait.  When I showed up on Craig St. I was surprised to find a nearby street parking space and not have to circle several times.  But that did not matter, my order still wasn't even started by the time that I was quoted the order to be ready.  Then add into that the fact that when I called in the order and by the time they started to prepare the order, the soup of the day was out.  So instead of setting aside the soup for our order, they sold it to someone that ordered after us.  

To say the girl that was running the register was frazzled is an understatement.  She literally was running around.  I think that she was new or inexperienced, and that was unsettling.  Especially when she went to make a cappuccino and didn't know how to steam the milk or how to pour the milk into the espresso.  Then when it came to getting the orders comprised and ready to go, my order was split between another lady's order.  Even though I was being rushed to leave and make space at the counter I'm glad I looked at my order before I left.  Why?  Because it still wasn't correct.

Anyway, enough with that, let's talk about the food.  I ordered the Spicy Grilled Cheese and Bacon with a small bowl of Cream of Tomato with Feta and Basil.  The grilled cheese was definitely the star of the day.  The soup on the other hand was extremely salty and I could not finish it.  

To sum it up, This place really did make eating unique, and not in a good way."}
{"text":"I ordered through grubhub and was very pleased with how fast the delivery was.  I ordered around 4:30pm and the food was delivered before 5:00p.m.  The menu selections are healthy and satisfying.  I'll definitely order again!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you're looking for a delicious lunch and are not short on time. Their soups are all pretty solid choices; I highly recommend either the tomato feta basil or chicken florentine! I normally get the half-sandwich/half-soup combo, but their sandwich options for the combo are pretty limited. Their chicken pesto sandwich is decent, but it can get pricey especially if you get it with a soup.

The biggest downside I can think of is the inconsistency in wait time. Depending on how many people ordered and how many people called in, the wait can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. The layout of the place is also a bit weird; you can't really hear the number of your order from the tables, so many people crowd by the counter where food comes out, which is right next to the cashier. As a result, it gets super crowded around an already small area. Everything's great once you get your food, but the ordering and waiting process can definitely be refined."}
{"text":"I'm also a little confused about the negative reviews -- today was my first day eating there, but I left extremely satisfied.

My boyfriend and I split the BLTTA wrap (Bacon, Lettuce, Turkey, Tomato, Avocado wrapped in a sun dried tomato tortilla) and it was DELICIOUS.  I don't think I can think of a bad thing to say about it, everything tasted super fresh, the avocado was almost more like guacamole and the contrast between that and the crispy texture of the bacon was amazing.  

We also got the Berry Salad, which was walnuts, goat cheese, thinly sliced strawberries and grilled chicken over mixed greens.  It came with Balsamic vinaigrette, but between the creaminess of the goat cheese and the strawberries you almost didn't need any dressing at all.  Between that and splitting the sandwich it was the perfect amount of food.

Highly recommended -- I wish I lived in Pittsburgh so I could eat here more often!"}
{"text":"While their sandwiches are tasty, there's just not enough for the price.  It's crowded and just not worth it when Quizno's and Subway are throwing $5 footlongs at your feet."}
{"text":"White chilli soup! It was delish! Well it's a good place to get healthy (relatively) food, it's cheap, fast. Great for college students. Its not fancy, their place is nice and cozy, lots of young people hanging there for a light meal! I loved the soup, it was more kind of chili than soup, not at all watery, and it really had tons of meat (in my case ground turkey). You will feel pretty full with the large size cup."}
{"text":"Anyone that goes to or works at Carnegie Mellon knows that we have the WORST food options ever on campus.  They taste ok, but they're expensive as can be.  One day I forgot to pack my lunch so I wandered down to Craig and Forbes.  I wait for the bus by Eat Unique so I figured I would test it out.

I ordered a spicy grilled cheese ($5.99 w tax).  I think it had pepper jack and cheddar cheese, tomato, and banana peppers.  There was supposed to be bacon, but it was either a negligible amount or they forgot it.  Maybe I was starving, but this sandwich was great.  I really loved the combination and the price is so fair.  Panera charges twice that for some of their sandwiches.

This place gets crazy at lunch time.  I think I waited about ten minutes, which is ok.  If I ever forget my lunch again, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Summer sandwich with double mozzarella. What did I get? Some concoction with bacon, italian peppers and I don't know what else. I am certainly not happy about this.

Granted, I have been eating here for more than 5 years and this is their first screw up. Nevertheless, not happy to have bitten a sandwich with bacon."}
{"text":"Chose this cafe for a quick bite based partially on previous reviews. Very disappointed to find iceberg lettuce and dry, shredded carrots from a package in my salad. I would have done better by going to a grocery store and picking up a Pre-packaged salad. The carpeting to the restroom was filthy which was a definite turnoff."}
{"text":"Love this place! Very veg friendly, and everything is delicious. I go for the Southwest Sizzler or the Chipotle Black Bean Burger. The portions are on the small side, so I often accompany with the Garden Chili. Never had a bad meal. Perfect for take-out or a no-frills dine-in experience.

The only downside (that keeps this from being 5 stars), is that it can be quite slow. They seem to be perpetually understaffed, with one person responsible for taking orders, restocking utensils, and handing off orders that are completed. I suspect they are understaffed in the kitchen as well, because sometimes the food itself can take a while to come out."}
{"text":"A very long wait (~15 minutes) for a very soggy sandwich.  I ordered a ruben, which only came with like two slices of corned beef.  It was grilled, but somehow, it came out disgustingly soggy, to the point where the bread no longer holds itself up and starts falling apart.  Disgusting, disgusting, disgusting.

Their pumpkin/butternut squash soup is also appalling.
I also had one of their cold wraps once.  Also disgusting.  I don't know why I came back a second time.

The only saving grace for this place is their cookies."}
{"text":"Some of their soups and sandwiches are good but twice recently their desserts have been awful- very stale brownies. I also on another occasion found a hair in my chocolate walnut bar. They need to improve. Service slow- I usually call in orders."}
{"text":"I'm not so sure what's so unique about this place--they offer a bunch of different soups, salads, sandwiches, and wraps, which seem pretty standard for cafes like this one. They're tasty though, and it's a decent option given the mediocre restaurants on Craig. I liked the summer berry salad, which tasted literally like a medley of healthiness; the Hawaiian chicken sub was another delicious fruity option, with the pineapple providing the sweet zest in the sandwich. Lots of other things sound good too, and we may keep trying different items as long as we're nearby."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I forgot to check in here. Not a place you should miss if you want a good, quick bite!

I ordered the lemon chiffon iced tea and a Gluten free bun with the Beef and Brie. Omg. Fantastic. The beef was tender and flavorful and the bun did not taste gf!

Highly recommend this place for gluten free and vegan needs but also, it is just good food for everyone to enjoy. 

Their philosophy is top notch, too!"}
{"text":"Looking through the reviews for Eat Unique, there are a lot of really positive ones, and a lot of really negative ones.  The truth is, from my experience, somewhere in the middle.  

The time between ordering the food and it being in your mouth is a little slow... I'd say if I were here on my lunch break, I'd be a bit miffed that I lost most of it.  The portions aren't really that big, but for city prices they're about in line with the cost.  Food quality is about a hair better than Panera, in my experience.

I've had the southwest somethingorother there, as well as a roast beef and brie baguette.  They were both satisfying, and the roast beef and brie was pretty excellent, especially with the brie being all melty.

The service may be slow, but it's also friendly, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"TERRIBLEE!!!
DIRTY SEATING, NO HEAT. HAIR IN FOOD. KITCHEN DID NOT WEAR GLOVES. 
GREASY FOOD. 

My first and only experience here was enough to never come back. This place is nothing more than fast food. The menu items sound gourmet with their ingredients in reality aren't what they're cracked up to me. I got their \"special\" blood orange tea\" and a \"spicy gourmet grilled cheese\". First of  all the tea tasted like nothing like oranges or tea more like flavored water. The sandwich oh dear. So on the menu is says it comes on sourdough bread with bacon, tomato, banana  peppers and pepperjack cheese. THAT is not all what I received! My sandwich came out on a piece of tin foil fsoaked in grease. It was not made on sourdough, it has no pepperjack, no tomatos. NOTHING about it was gourmet. Literally just some white bread with some form of greasy yellow cheese and some uncooked bacon. The seating was just like a fast food restuarant, DIRTY WALLS, DIRTY (LOOKING) EMPLOYEES.
Being completely grossed out I opened my sandwich to pick the disgusting bacon and guess what I found?!! You guessed it  HAIR. YES THERE WAS A BIG PIECE OF BLACK HAIR IN MY FOOD.
MIND YOU my meal cost over twelve dolars for a small sandwich and tea.
I told the cashier she didn't even apoligize or seem surprised when I handed the sandwich to her. IF I wouldn't have opened my sandwich I would have eaten hair. 
I'M DISGUSTED. This place is GARBAGE."}
{"text":"I love this place. Been coming here for years:) the white turkey chili is my favorite :) also the tuna melt!!! Yum yum yum"}
{"text":"-1 star for awful layout
-1 star for a 15 minute wait for a tiny, untasty sandwich
-1 star for people who work there

First time I tried to eat there, nothing appealed on the menu and I walked away. Should have walked away this time too and I'm definitely not coming back"}
{"text":"Their garden veggie sandwich is a. may. zing.  The tastiest vegetable infused sandwich I've ever eaten in my life.  

Usually 'healthy' or 'veggie' sandwiches are bland and boring and I generally wind up regretting trying to go with the healthier option, but not this time.  Love. it. 

Go get one now!"}
{"text":"Came here a lot when I was in college. Their sandwiches are fresh and not too expensive. Their Garden Chili is delicious and spicy. And it's vegan!

Their most popular sandwich is the Great Rinaldi which is essentially a meatloaf sandwhich. I don't like meatloaf too much so didn't enjoy that one. I did like their Italian panini. It has mozzarella and vegetables encased in nice and crispy bread like a panini should. It's just a little bit oily.

Their baked good are also pretty decent. Definitely get their spiced pumpkin cookies in the Fall."}
{"text":"Edible yet generic.

Had the chicken pesto sandwich. Way overpriced, small, mediocre sandwich at a dirty restaurant from a rude waitress.  I'll pass."}
{"text":"Honestly good food very fresh and tasty but the eating are is dated and the price is too high for what you get."}
{"text":"Eat Unique is a decent place to have lunch. It's not a hang out place but they have lots of clean tables and chairs. For some reason their water tap has only warm water.
 Be prepared to wait a bit for your food to be ready or you can just order by phone and pick it up."}
{"text":"Great menu with a lot of choices. Portions are OK sized but won't satiate if you're hungry. We thought the food was good, not great. Dining area looked unkempt and a little grungy. There's better options around the area for the general sandwich eater, but having a large amount of veg options helps keep Unique Eats on the radar."}
{"text":"Here's the one thing about Eat Unique:  the food is quite good -- interesting and tasty.

Here's the other thing about Eat Unique: if you go during the lunchtime rush, they will take forever to finish your order, and then there's a good chance they will have gotten the order wrong.

The counter is a whirling nightmare of poorly designed space, with various customers milling around waiting to order, waiting for their order, or trying to figure out if the mysterious back register is open or not.

If you're here during the lunch rush, your only hope for not dying of starvation is ordering pre-made food: salads and soups.  If you order a grilled sandwich, you're completely screwed.

This is a shame because, as I said, the food is actually pretty good.  If they could turn an order around in less than 5 minutes, I'd eat here every day.  But until then, I can only take eating here about once a month.   I want lunch to lower my stress, not increase it.

On a positive note, they do have good breakfast sandwiches, and the place is usually not busy at breakfast, so you can grab a good bite to eat there in the mornings."}
{"text":"Pretty typical.  Do you want cutely presented sandwiches, salads (that may or may not actually be healthy, depending on how many tortilla chips they put in it)?  Do you want a place where your most exciting vegetarian options are probably hummus & veggie sandwich with vegan chili?  Do you want a place that will get out of your way and let you talk with the girlfriends?  Then this might be the place for you.  Utterly inoffensive, but fine if you want a place like that.  Think of it as a slightly hipper version of Panera."}
{"text":"Crowded for lunch!

Think Panera, but not in the corporate chain restaurant sense.  Think, fresh made-from-scratch soup.  

Full disclosure, I've worked within blocks from Eat Unique, which I still call Craig Street Coffee, for years.  Is the food good?  Yes.  Is the service good?  Meh. Is it insanely chaotic during lunch?  A resounding YES. 

The food here is vegan friendly for sure. Lots of homemade soups and delicious sandwiches to choose from.  I'm fairly certain their soup is made from scratch daily. 

I can't give Eat Unique five stars because every time I go there for lunch I'm under extreme duress. This is due to the two register chaos, lack of room to wait for your order, and the amount of time you have to wait for a sandwich.  But it's good food and a good pick if you're wondering aimlessly on Craig Street, as I often am."}
{"text":"This is on my list of standard lunch/dinner places. I go here because I love their summer sandwich. It is great bread with mozzarella, veggies and house special balsamic vinegarette that I *love*. That said, a sandwich costs about $8. Other sandwiches are touch and go. I sometimes love it and other times they don't get it right. I like the soup (cold Pittsburgh winters). I also love the cookie selection. I can never finish a cookie since it is really big, but I get one if I feel like treating myself - my favorite being the sea-salt cookie. You can also get great coffee. Sometimes it can take time for them to make your food. I always call and pick it up later."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place for a college town. I enjoyed my food there and I was served quickly. 

The only thing that sort of bothered me was the fact that the service didn't seem to even know what was on the menu or what I was ordering when I asked questions. At first, I thought it was just my order, but someone else came in right after me and asked some questions and also got the same blank stare and \"I don't know\" response. 

I got a grilled veggie wrap and it was decent. A little greasy (but I was expecting that from a deli style place like this) but it was satisfying enough to make a dinner out of.  It looked like their baked goods were pretty popular (saw a few vegan things which was nice!) but I didn't get the chance to try any. 

Like I said, for a college town, this is a pretty great place to eat. I'd also imagine it was a really nice place to study as well. I was in Pittsburgh on a business trip when I went here and it was quiet enough to relax and not be bothered, which I do appreciate."}
{"text":"Of all the places you can eat on Craig Street, eat unique is the most healthy. Everything is fresh and made to order. They get very busy at lunchtime and sometimes you can wait a few minutes for your order and the waiting area is tight. But you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"At the end of the day, this is your run-of-the-mill cafe. If you don't come here expecting a meal that will blow your mind, you'll be fine, but with a name like \"Eat Unique\", I expected better.

I've had the chance to try a couple salads and sandwiches from here and while all have been fine, none would make me want to come back for more. If you're not in the mood for some of the more ethnic dishes Craig has to offer, this is a fine option for a quick sandwich, but there's nothing really unique about it. As a plus for vegetarians, they have a slew of vegetarian and vegan options that could be great for people who can't find another accommodating place on Craig"}
{"text":"Ehhhh I didn't think this was unique at all, but it was tasty. We came here on a whim about 15 minutes before they closed. I ordered a California chicken club and they were out of focaccia so I had to have it on a regular bun-type of bread. It was pretty good. My friend had the chili and she loved it. I also got a pumpkin cookie and that definitely hit the spot on multiple levels. I'd go back just for that cookie. The two ladies working there the other night were nice and helpful with menu items, which is alway a plus."}
{"text":"I visited on a random Tuesday during the lunch rush, but I managed to grab a table to devour one of the delicious (and vegan) veggie burgers. I usually steer clear of vegan options since I'm clearly not a vegan, but the Malibu Avocado burger was pretty good, however the bun was strange. All in all, Eat Unique is just average-- kind of like a Panera, but with more options for those who have dietary limitations. Nothing too memorable."}
{"text":"The popular Oakland eatery offers simple sandwiches, salads and soups made from fresh and high quality ingredients.  There are hardly any masterful recipes or breathtaking culinary skill in the kitchen, but pleasing combinations and vibrant flavors can be found all over the menu.  It's an excellent spot to balance the health of your body with the health of your wallet, without sacrificing deliciousness.

(This reviewer's favorite item is the pesto chicken sandwich.)"}
{"text":"I LOVE the white Turkey chili! They have incredible baked goods, and I've liked every salad and sandwich that I've tried! It does get a tad crowded during lunch hour, but the service has been quick. One time they forgot to give me one the sandwiches I ordered, I came back and they were very nice and apologetic and gave us a free cookie! I love having this place right down the street"}
{"text":"+ Holy f. The Roma sub is what dreams are made of. Pesto, Italian cold cuts, roasted red peppers, arugula, balsamic, cheese, all toasted into a delicious omgasm. 
+ The chilis and soups looked delicious although I did not get a chance to try them.
+ I'm not typically a soy chai kind of guy, but after trying a sip of one from Eat Unique, I may be a convert. Don't tell anyone.

- It took a while for order (maybe 10 minutes), but it was made to order and fresh.
- Hectic line and ordering situation. Perhaps they should move the rear register next to front one to avoid confusion amongst customers and having to tell every other customer that there is a second secret register."}
{"text":"Oakland is full of lunch places, but if you are looking for something light, healthy, and fresh, you're pretty much out of luck....except for Eat Unique!  I had lunch here earlier today, and was so excited to see a menu of sandwiches and salads that didn't contain french fries....

The atmosphere is minimalist.  There are some bright colors, but it's mostly just cafeteria-style tables and chairs, no decoration.  You order at the counter, then wait awhile - about 15 minutes in our case - for your lunch.  My boyfriend got the meatloaf melt, and I ordered the grilled chicken pesto sandwich.  It was hard to wait so long, but as soon as we got our sandwiches it was obvious why we had been left hanging - the food was FRESH.  My sandwich was hot, the chicken fresh off the grill, the tomatoes sweet and flavorful, the pesto made in-house (you can see the rustic bits of pine nuts and basil, definitely not the jarred stuff), the ciabatta roll lightly toasted and crispy.  I was really impressed from the first bite.  There's nothing really unique about the sandwich, except that it is made with high-quality ingredients and hasn't been sitting in a case all day, but that made a huge difference!  I tried my boyfriend's meatloaf sandwich, which wasn't as big as I thought it would be, and I liked it okay...the sauce was pretty sweet.  I preferred mine - it tasted so garden fresh.

For dessert we had a black bean brownie - yes, really - and it was great!  Who knew?  It just tastes like a creamy, chocolatey brownie.  You can put black beans in dessert!?  This changes everything.  Definitely craveworthy.

The only thing I'm not crazy about is the ambiance.  Since you have to wait so long, it'd be nice if the dining area was more comfortable or better maintained.  There was lots of water on the floor and I almost slipped a few times, we had to wipe down our own table....not a huge deal, but we noticed.  There are lots of big, sunny windows, so that's a plus.  I was also disappointed in the small Styrofoam cups for water - I hate drinking out of Styrofoam, it feels so wasteful (and the cups are so small you have to go back a million times to refill).  But I'd definitely come back - maybe for takeout next time - if I was very tasty and unlike anything else you can get in the area."}
{"text":"This place is decent and the atmosphere is warm and cozy.  I ordered the cobb salad to go and it was a decent salad but there were some things that could have been better.  For example, it said it came with avocado which I assumed would be slices of fresh avocado, but instead it was a guacamole that was not fresh made with no chunks in it.  The chicken was nice those--it was warm and I think fresh grilled.  It did take awhile to come out and came in a tiny box that it was crammed into so it made it really hard for me to the dressing and toppings together when I was eating it.  They also appear to have a really nice section of loose leaf teas and coffee.  I'm not sure why it's called Eat Unique since except for maybe a couple of options the food doesn't seem all that unique to me.  Mostly typical sandwiches, salads, and soups.  I think it's a little pricey for what you get and the servers weren't that friendly."}
{"text":"Don't you wish this place was cheaper? And faster? And didn't have such a garish color scheme? Nicer employees? Maybe better food too? Well, actually a place like that exists. It's called schenley park cafe."}
{"text":"Very hit or miss busy lunchtime place. Sort of overpriced but since it's the only place of it's kind within a 6 block radius I'd say there isn't much incentive for them to lower their prices. 

The wait times can be extremely long so call ahead for your order if you can. The line can also get out of hand because folks don't properly know how to queue once they've placed their order. Be sure to go to the back counter and ask for a soup sample before buying--they say they make their soups daily but I've definitely had an old batch or two of chili that was clearly a few days old. When it's fresh, it's great. But when it's not it's the absolute worst.

I'd be more inclined to give this place another star if everything was simply $1 cheaper, but since I work nearby I'm sure I'll be back for another $12 lunch soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch place in Pittsburgh. I recommend the tomato soup and hummus sandwich:-)"}
{"text":"Dreadfully slow kitchen. Even when there isn't a crowd and even when they're not understaffed by any means (one person languishing away at the register and four others in the kitchen). Food is decent enough, but don't come here if you have an appointment in the next hour, as it takes about half an hour for them to prepare very simple meals."}
{"text":"An excellent sandwich shop, we went there while filming interviews at UPMC. Close to the campus, and fast service. I love that they are very environmentally conscious,  and I like to support businesses that are. 

I had their chicken pesto sandwich and loved it. Tried the roast beef/horse radish sandwich too. Great selection and combinations of flavors and sides.

I highly recommend them, and go back when I am in the area."}
{"text":"i hate paying CA prices in pburgh! however, i can't resist the amazingness of the tomato-basil soup. mmmmmm. i'll usually come here when i get my loan money or i'm just so damn sick of quiznos, lulus, or subway. in general, i try to avoid 5th & craig food as much as i can but the proximity to hamburg hall coupled w/ my inability to wake up early enough to pack a lunch keeps me around. i'll pass on the sandwhiches, i CAN make that stuff at home and the salads aren't anything fascinating either. JUST THE SOUP."}
{"text":"Great healthy and fresh food.  I highly recommend for lunch but sometimes the wait can be a little long!  Garden veggie, goat cheese chicken and salads are a good bet.  A little more expensive than some chain restaurants for lunch but worth it."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good sandwich! Fresh tasting and intriguing combinations of meats and veggies. Not the cheapest (around $6-8/sandwich) but certainly one of the better sandwiches I've ever had for that price. 

I'd go again."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time. Had chicken salad sandwich and white chili. Chili was great, however the chicken salad was a little bland. I'll be back again tho"}
{"text":"I believe I got the chicken noodle soup when it was a special. It was full of veggies and noodles and tasted alright. The place had an odd smell inside which made me not want to eat there. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I've only been twice, but I had really good sandwiches both times! The first time I got a garlic chicken sandwich off their daily menu (changes every day) but today I got their Chicken Ranch Griller (Grilled chicken breast, provolone, lettuce, tomato & smoked Applewood bacon, with ranch dressing on a toasted French roll). Their food tastes fresh and I really like their bread! I heard they have pretty good dessert but I'm Lenting off sweets so I have to come back next time to try and review them! Their service was pretty quick and the staff was friendly both times. 

The atmosphere is really chill and quiet so it's a nice spot to get work done AND they have free WiFi which is a plus! They also take Dinex so CMU students, this place is a must try!"}
{"text":"I used to think this was the best lunch option on Craig Street, but I'm not so sure anymore.  Their food is OK, but nothing to write home about.  And it costs you a pretty penny.

The standard soups are pretty decent; I like the tomato feta, and the white turkey chili is great if you like turkey and beans.  I have tried some \"special\" soups of the day that really missed the spot.  Fortunately, they can give you samples of soup before you choose to order it -- don't be shy to ask for them!

Their salads are reasonable -- the greens mix is fresh, and the meat is fine.

I've also tried the pesto chicken sandwich, which I like (although the chicken isn't the best quality), the italian veggie wrap, which I found to be way too oily and heavy, and the BLTTA, which I did not like.  The \"avocado\" part of the BLTTA is some kind of soft guacamole-like paste clearly squeezed from a tube.  Don't expect fresh slices from an actual avocado!

Their desserts always look super appealing, but I always regret them once I get them.  They are super heavy...TOO heavy -- either saturated with butter, or sugar, or both -- I often feel sick after eating a whole one!  They are also not cheap!

All in all, I would expect the quality of the food here to be better for the prices they are charging (you'll easily have a $10 lunch here).  If you want to give it a try, the best bargain is to get soup.  Oh yeah, and the other reviews are right about the shitty checkout-line space!"}
{"text":"Got a veggie panini. So good, especially the bread. Portions a little on the smaller side, but still a good deal of food. Can't wait to come back & try something else!"}
{"text":"I know I am looking forward to my next trip to Eat Unique! This is such a refreshing place to go for lunch!  If you work in Oakland it's very convenient and the food is delicious!

Speaking as a vegetarian, they have some really nice options.  Their summer sandwhich on rosemary focaccia is phenom and the sweet bean hummus is also really enjoyable (minus the onions.)  

I suggest trying the Pumpkin Pear Bisque - it is delightful!"}
{"text":"Consistency is always a plus. Eat Unique is one of the better food options on Craig Street. Their sandwiches, salads and soups are made from ingredients so fresh you can taste it. All of their creations are very inventive and delicious. And at a very reasonable price considering the quality of food you're getting. A sandwich is about the same price as a Subway sandwich, but SO MUCH BETTER.

I recommend getting the half and half option (choose 2 from half sandwich, soup, salad). Their Tomato Basil and Feta soup is phenomenal. For sandwiches, I recommend the Southwest Sizzler (veg), Hummus (veg), Summer (veg), and the Tuna Melt."}
{"text":"GLUTEN FREE RIPOFF!!! I was very excited to see all the gluten free options at EatUnique. They were very accommodating to my allergy. It's rare to go to a sandwich shop and find gluten free bread. That being said, I was charged an extra $1.50 to have the gluten free bread. The extra fee is not what I'm upset about; I am use to being charged to have a gluten free substitute. What stunned me was the portion size. As you can see in the picture, the \"small soup\" I ordered is BIGGER than my sandwich. Inside my sandwich included ONE slice of tomato,ONE slice of Mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 of a cup of lettuce. If I am going to be charged extra for gluten free, make the inside of the sandwich the equivalent of a regular sandwich. COMPLETE RIPOFF. Had I not ordered the small cup of soup I would have left hungry. If you are going to EatUnique for gluten free options, don't. Buying the ingredients at the store would not only be cheaper but more filling than coming here."}
{"text":"I don't think this place is anything to write home about. I thought it was supposed to be healthy and well... unique. It's not. It's just sandwiches, salads, and soups. Also, they're expensive. I can find equal or better options elsewhere. It's a nice option on Craig Street, but that's not saying much.

Inside the place is kinda dingy and weird. There's nowhere to sit because there are students camped out everywhere. If you get one, many of the tables are weird and wobbly."}
{"text":"Sandwich quality is equivalent to make it yourself at home (except I could do it better). Maybe I should have opted for one of the oven-roasted but the regular sandwiches were overpriced. 

The tomato bisque was good and would be the only reason I would ever return. 

The service was ... less than helpful. It's okay if you don't know the answer but it'd be nice if they asked someone else instead of disregarding my question and giving me something I told them I didn't want. 

Also, if you're vegan the options are really limited (to essentially soup or chili). I was expecting a lot more variety since the logo and name imply a healthier alternative, but like everything else it was a disappointment. 

The price is equivalent to panera (which is overpriced) but the quality and service do not make up for such high prices. Looks like I'll be sticking to Panera or even subway. At least subway charges a decent price and actually offers more flavor."}
{"text":"I just got the chicken pesto sandwich and it was so good that I forgot to take a picture. I've been wanting to get it for a while now but I'm always afraid to try something new on my Lunch break since this is the only thing I eat until dinner but this was seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The chicken is pure white and thick, pesto sauce is fresh and light, the bread is delicious and it's just big enough that I don't feel overly full but I'm not still hungry, amazing."}
{"text":"I love Eat Unique!  I'm not really a meat-eater, so I really appreciate that their menu has so many veggie options.  Every sandwich that I've ever ordered has been delicious, I usually try whatever is written on their blackboard when I enter the restaurant.  Pretty much anything involving: goat cheese, fig anything, Brussels sprouts, Brie, or beets I will without a doubt order....their cookies are also ridiculously good!  In addition, service is efficient, which makes it an excellent option for lunch."}
{"text":"After a night of bar hopping and an early Saturday shopping and running errands a healthy lunch is in order. 
Three stars just because I think it's a little pricey.
Had a Black Forest ham sandwich with homemade pesto, fresh mozzarella, roasted red peppers, spinach and vinaigrette on a focaccia style roll. It was really tasty.
My boyfriend had tuna salad with lettuce and tomato on farm bread.
The food is tasty and healthier than typical deli fare."}
{"text":"Eat Unique.  The name totally threw me off.  For some reason I had it in my head that this would be sorta like a health food deli.  And you ask...why did you think that Rachel?  Usually because I just make my mind up that that's what it's going to be.  Totally solid reasoning, right!?

What I was excited about where the alternative food sub options.  I ordered a Taco Salad and instead of beef chili I ordered turkey chili.  That, in my head, was healthy.  In reality I don't think a heaping portion of gauc, sour cream and cheese added up to zero calories.  Let's also consider the fact that for a moment I thought I had ordered JUST a nacho platter because the ratio of nacho chips vs lettuce was about 20 chips to 1 piece of lettuce.  Don't get me wrong...it was really REALLY good...but it was a nacho platter.  

And you know what...I am TOTALLY ok with that!  Eat Unique folks!"}
{"text":"I came in on a rainy Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was rather empty, with most customers ordering to go. I ordered the cream of tomato with feta and basil with a grilled cheese with bacon. I was a little disappointed by how dilute the soup was, as usually a cream-based soup should be thicker. Nevertheless the grilled cheese hit the spot."}
{"text":"I am so unclear why Eat Unique doesn't have a better average rating because this place has always blown my palate away.  You can tell the ingredients are fresh; the combinations are clever and full of flavor; and I haven't ordered anything that wasn't extremely delicious (or soggy).  I think this place blows Panera away in terms of variety, taste, and price.  The wedding soup is especially amazing - it never needs cheese, salt, and/or pepper.  
And I have to say - if you're complaining about WAITING 15 minutes for a sandwich that does have MEAT on it, then GO TO MICKEY D'S!  It blows my mind that people get mad at waiting for FRESH FOOD!  Guess what?  FRESH FOOD takes longer than 30 seconds to zap in a microwave!   If you want your radon with that sandwich, again, you can go find that crap on any corner.  It is called \"Eat Unique\"; not \"Eat Like All The Other Corporate Franchises.\"  If you want your 5-minute wait for a foot long - you don't need me to tell you where to go.
That being said, the grilled chicken pesto sandwich is my #1 favorite and order it most often (pesto - the blending of basil, pine nuts, and garlic; if you want your mayo, again go somewhere else).  But their veggie sandwich or wrap is also heaven.
The only gripe I have is that it's on Craig St right in between Forbes and Fifth; which makes it very difficult to find parking if you're ordering to go.  But I can only knock a star off for that because the food is too good....I'll drive around the block a few times if I have to!  
If you're a real foodie, and you're in Oakland, pass up LuLus noodles and go across the street to Eat Unique for real food."}
{"text":"I thought the sandwiches were tiny... but...

tomato basil soup is YUM. I regret not getting the large when i was there, but I have learned my lesson.

Oh... and it's quite cute inside.

That is all. 

(TOMATO BASIL SOUP IS YUM. I'd go back anytime for that. I could even have just that for lunch every day for a while.)"}
{"text":"I thought it was a little expensive for a salad in a box that I ordered from a counter and ate outside because it was so packed inside.  It was a good salad though.  I think I will try some other places on my find out where to eat lunch tour before I go back here."}
{"text":"This place is great for vegetarians. Their Southwest sizzler sandwich is my all time favorite. I am usually here for lunch. I get the southwest sizzler sandwich with Tomatoe or mushroom soup. The soups here are delicious. Perfect meal for me."}
