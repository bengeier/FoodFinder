{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh, clean clean clean!! I love this little shop, it has super good churros, like nothing else I have ever tried. The tacos are out of this world, built with love and the freshest ingredients. I guess there isn't much of an excuse, there back door literally empties out to the Jean talon market. I don't know why there isn't more reviews for this place. I just stopped in for lunch and half way through lunch, I cancelled my supper plans and I am planning to come back for supper, this place is that good.  Super friendly staff too!! Smart business move on their part. You can purchase all the sauces, tortilla shells, cactus in brine etc so you can try to make the same stuff at home. It's a super smart idea."}
{"text":"If you're ever in the vicinity of Jean-Talon market, stop everything and grab your food there. First, because it will get you off the craziness of the busy market, second because the people in there are so welcoming and friendly you'd want to stay there forever and third simply because the food is great, the plates are full and the check won't give you a heart attack. We grabbed burritos and a watermelon juice there the other day and it was just perfect. If you don't believe me, well just go and try it for yourself. No, really what are you waiting for? Why are you still reading this? Go, go, before I eat it all and leave none for you!"}
{"text":"Sa devanture donne sur la rue Jean-Talon et l'arrière cours au marché du même nom. Je suis étonné qu'il n'y ait simplement que deux avis.   L'établissement se traduit en deux temps. L'espace marché s'assortie avec symétrie à la surface désigné aux tables. On y trouve des produits appartenant en propre à l'Amérique latine telles des friandises épicées à base de tamarins. Un service bien manifestant de bienséance chaleureuse."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole. BEST MEXICAN FOOD I HAVE EVER EATEN (and I live in California...) Torta was juicy and to die for: layers of guac, sour cream, this slow cooked beef of sorts, cheese... all on a toasted bun. Barbacoa tacos were sooo flavorful...   Free chips and salsa was a plus!  Service was ehh but food definitely made up for it!"}
