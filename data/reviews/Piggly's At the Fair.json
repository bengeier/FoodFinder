{"text":"Worst Barbeque place that I have ever been. Food sucks and taste stale. I had Barbeque beef and tasted like a month old and dry then they replaced it with Barbeque pork taste like dry spam. I will never come back in this place again."}
{"text":"We went around 3pm on a sunday. I had seen the place a few times and wanted to try it but its not quite local to me. The first thing i noticed was it smelled exactly like going to the state fair...i mean exactly. You get your choice of full service or self service. We opted for self service. The cashier was very friendly. The tables have butcher paper on them with a glass of crayons to draw whatever absurd thing crosses your mind while you wait for your food. The food was somewhere between average and better than average. I gave it a B. My biggest gripe is that since i dont drink soda, or anything else with sugar, i generally opt for water which they choose to serve in the equivalent of a shot glass while the other 2 people i came with had soda served in big boy cups. It made me feel as though i were being punished because i choose a healthier beverage.

Its a cute place to bring kids. Its a deep fried culinary paradise. But i may not venture a second visit there myself."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!! i love this place!!!! Great food & great service. Will definitely come back and tell my friends about piggly's"}
{"text":"We tried Piggly's and not impressed.  We went there and ordered take out.  We tried the ribs and a BBQ  sandwich.  The ribs didn't have a good flavor
 and the sauce was very bland. We also tried some sides of barbeque beans that tasted like chili beans and the zucchini and fries were barely cooked.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"were here for spring training and stumbled upon this place. OH man, It's the best! Today special was all you can eat beef ribs, 2 sides and a salad. THE BEST!!!

They have a special everyday. Wish this place were in our town in Gilroy,Ca"}
{"text":"The food is a 2.5 at best, but I am giving this a 1.0 because the customer service is horrendous. If they keep this up I give them another year before it completely fails.
I ordered the create your own baked potato, I asked for sausage on it, instead of bacon or what ever. The person at the register said she had to ask, so she turned around and asked the cook if she would do that. The cook said NO. So obviously the cashier said no I would have to order an entirely different meal to get the sausage on my baked potato. So just to see what the big deal was, I did. So I got the sausage spent the extra money and all it came with was fries.. I mean REALLY !! Now, not only am I not a happy customer, because what I asked was extremely easy to do. They turned out to be greedy.  

So in response to this and being a computer person, I am posting this to every social network. Facebook, twitter and about half of dozen others."}
{"text":"We went there Saturday night  for the whole pig roast they're advertising for Fri-Sun: Sorry, no pig this week. OK, let's have a rack of ribs: Sorry, we're out or ribs. How about the pulled pork? Sorry, I think we're out - hold-on! No, we still have some. So we ordered the pulled pork, some wings, and the Piggly Fries. Result:
- Pulled pork was dry with some sugary flavor, that's it. 
- Wings were small dry overcooked little things
- Fries: So salty, we could hardly eat them (and we're fries lovers!)
- Even the iced tea had a watery flavor

A case of \"won't be back\""}
{"text":"I ate at Pigglys for dinner last night. Had a shot called funnel cake and it came out curdled.  Absolutely disgusting. Had some sliders first. They werent great but probably the least gross. The ribs were so hard and tough we had to give up after a few bites. However they were nice enough to take it off the bill. The coleslaw was bad. It tasted expired and looked wilted. The potato salad..not much better. My bathroom experience afterwards was less than desired. This morning I woke up with sharp pains in my stomach. I had to leave work early today because of the pain this place gave me. Moral is this carnie food = no good"}
{"text":"Do not recommend the ribs or the maccorini. Ribs were dry and crunchy and the maccorini was very runny."}
{"text":"The brisket was really good.  The hamburger was above average.  The loaded fries were huge portions, and were pretty good.

4 stars because the place is unique in a neighborhood of chain-restaurant blandness.  The menu is \"brave\" considering we are becoming a world of calorie nannies.

Eat here, if for no other reason, you are unlikely to ever see another restaurant like this one."}
{"text":"Great evening withy son at Piggly's   He had a giant foot long corn dog.  Highlight of the evening was the balloon lady. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Fun and different. Had the brisket supper. It was good, side salad was make your own at salad bar. Also ordered the ribs, Very tough/dry. Also Riley fries were very good. Fried Snickers bar for dessert. I have had these at the fair, much better. Snickers was still cold/frozen in center. Tough to cut with plastic utensils. Stick with fried Oreos....I would go back.If in the area."}
{"text":"Went for lunch around 1:00 on a Sunday. Busy, but not close to full. Took 15 minutes to get 2 draft beers- and we were sitting at the bar. Took another 45 mins to get a loaded baked potato and pulled pork sandwich. Our quick lunch ended up being 90 minutes! Food was OK, but service is terrible and prices are high. Skip this place and go to Joe's BBQ in downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"What I ate: pulled pork BBQ sandwich, fries, onion rings, strawberry lemonade.

Experience: BBQ pork was tender, the house BBQ sauce was good. The bun, fries, and onion rings were greasy-greasy-greasy. The onion rings were extremely bland. Some touch of seasoning, please? 

Just okay. For the prices,  probably would not go back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great service, & surprisingly good food. My boyfriend has asking me to go since it opened & I expected everything to taste like fryer oil... This is far from true it was actually delicious!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today. There was practically no one in the place (about 4 families) there were at least 3 waitresses I could see. My party of two stepped in. One of the waitresses immediately said \"Hi\" and kept walking (she might have been busy at the time). 10 minutes later, she had passed us 5 more times without saying a word (nor did she appear to be serving any tables) and the other two never even left the back of the restaurant, nor did they bother to look up from their conversation. 

I was hoping to get a taste of fair favorites from my childhood but all I got was a whiff of barbecue and a growling stomach. Frustrated, we decided to walk over to Texas Roadhouse to get real service and real food. I hope they know they just lost two heavy tipping customers."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday for mothers day because the wait was too long everywhere else so we thought let's give this a try. That was a bad choice! I really wasted my money! They advertise fair food and hand dipped corn dogs however that was the worst corn dog I've ever had! It tasted like greasy pancake batter and not even close to a corn dog! Frozen grocery store much better. The brisket had zero flavor and the fried zucchini was a greasy much mess. We had to go out to our truck to get a drink because he never came with our refill and we left to use the restroom because it was disgusting! I wish I would have checked that first!"}
{"text":"My wife and I LOVE fair food but don't always love going to the fair.  The food was just as delicious as when we get it at the fair!  The whole experience was just like the fair only we didn't pay to get in and there wasn't mass amounts of people bumping into me!  Their menu has everything your fry love'n heart could want. Even fry desserts! You can order fair portions or regular portions (which are still pretty big for us).  We really enjoyed ourselves.  

Its meant to feel like you are at the fair so you go up to the counter to order and pick up your food.  There is a full service bar on one side of the restaurant for \"fair party poopers\".  Its not fast food prices but we felt it was worth it for the quality of the food...way better then fast food meals.  If you buy a drink you get free refills for the night and if you bring back the plastic cup on your next visit its only a dollar when you come in for unlimited fountain drinks.  

There are also fair games you can play that add to the character.  I'm not sure if it was just for the grand opening or if its an on going thing but kids were able to win small prizes for the games they won."}
{"text":"Just went tonight for out 4th time. Service has been amazing every time!!!! The staff is always so friendly. I love the atmosphere! The food is juicy and tasty. The BBQ sauce is average but really I just eat my meats without it. The funnel cake was fresh made and delicious! We will be back! You should try this place!"}
{"text":"We went to two different restaurants trying to house a party of 12.  No  go can't help you.  Thesr guys are bending over backwards.  They ROCK"}
{"text":"They did a great job with the theme. I gave this place a shot for the BBQ. I was not to impressed. When i ordered i added brisket, the waitress mentioned that is their signature item, to say the least  i have had alot better."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch. Split a brisket supper with a friend. The brisket was amazing! Great sauce. Great service. For sides we had beans and potato salad. Both were good, I preferred the beans. Clean place, nice clean restrooms. Games all around the place. Prices were good. Only thing is they only have plastic silverware, but other than that, we were more than pleased!"}
{"text":"Since my last review, I was contacted by Piggly's to give them a second chance.   I have since gone there to give them a second chance.   I've also asked a few friends to try them out to see how their experiences have been.

I can say that the organization the second time was a lot better.   More then one register was being utilized which did help with any lines.   I will say that I did sit at the full service area for a couple of hours and observed the operation.   The night I went on they were able to handle the influx of guests during the couple of waves that I observed.

I did notice that between 7:30 pm - 8:00 pm time period they was a rush that occurs.  I asked the waitress as it seemed an odd time for a rush of that magnitude.  Turns out that is about when the whole pig is completed cooking and regulars all converge to get the fresh pork.

I did try out the fresh pork and I will say that it was really good.  I'd recommend the fresh pork right off the spit.   The brisket can either be served lean or with more fat on it.   The rub on the brisket was not overpowering with minimal bark.   So if you are a bark fan on your brisket you may be disappointed.   Overall it did remind me of a good TX brisket.

Now for the BBQ sauce, this is one of those personal items that I'm sure people will never agree on.   It is your traditional tomato based sauced as apposed to a Carolina vinegar base or Georgia mustered based sauce.   The sauce was very similar in taste to Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.   

My other friends did try the place on different days and times.   I think the key is to hit this place at just the right time."}
{"text":"We had held off on trying this restaurant mostly because of the lack of healthy options.  Not that I would expect them to be offered.  It is, after all, fair food.  After much begging from our kids and my hubby being in the mood for a corn dog (random!)  we decided to try it out.  I wish we hadn't have waited! When you walk in you are greeted and advised how it works.  Seating to the right you order at the counter and to the left (basically the bar) its full service.  We sat in a booth at the bar.  Waiter was fast, friendly and quick with refills on our drinks.  We ordered a variety of foods so we could try all kinds of goodies :  Turkey leg, brisket sandwich,  fried zucchini, onion rings, corn dog and funnel cake for dessert.  Fries also came with the sandwich and turkey leg.  Your food comes out on a tray that is covered in paper.  The food is just on the tray.  Not separated by person or on plates.  Obviously meant to be family style.  Fun and different!   Everything was amazingly delish!  The turkey leg was  tender and had a great taste.  The brisket was perfect (and I have to tell you we are super picky about our bbq), zucchini and onion rings were massive, but not overly breaded so still crispy and the funnel cake was warm yummy fried goodness.  The fries were the only thing I wasn't thrilled about.  They seemed super greasy and kind of soggy.  I didn't think the prices were bad.  We spent $60 (with tip) for 4, ordered a ton of stuff and couldn't even finish it all.  Seems like we spend about that anywhere else we go.  The decor is bright and fun.  They have lots of Ferris wheel seats around and pics of the AZ state fair.  Also, right in the middle of the restaurant is where they cook the turkey's and pig.  Kids thought it was neat to see them rotating on the spicket.  Next time we have a deep fried craving we will be back.  I really want to try the deep fried snickers and my hubby wants to try the fried bacon sticks.  Again,  not the healthiest of places to eat, but fun, delicious, and worth a try!"}
{"text":"We will definitely be back... Maybe tomorrow?  Super fun environment, tilt a whirl benches, bright colors, hardwoods and just plain fun filled decor!  
The food was terrific- everything was homemade from the smoked meats - to the home baked rolls and sauces & rubs. Service was incredible and menu selections were good.  I can't say enough other than the Smoked Turkey sand which with homemade cranberry sauce aioli is to die for!"}
{"text":"YUCK....that's the nicest thing I can say. The brisket was slaughtered. Sliced the wrong way so it was stringy. The Broccoli/Cheese soup went into the garbage disposal (I ordered a meal to-go), the potato salad was barely tolerable. I am from Texas where you DO NOT ask if you want 'lean' or 'moist'. Where a brisket stands on its own without being smothered in nasty sauce. The people who own this place should have more respect for this cut of meat and teach their staff how to slice it. Also, the waitress had been drinking. You could smell it from five feet away."}
{"text":"Positives:

Turkey Legs
Frog Legs
Battered Deep Fried Bacon Sticks
Gator
Cotton Candy

.. foods that you don't typically find around here. Very interesting.

Staff was very friendly and approachable.

Negatives:

A little confusing that one side of the restaurant is self-serve and other side is not. A hostess was in the front and explained to us how it works, but I think better signage may suffice in the future (?), not sure..

No plates given to you to separate the food (from the food tray) when you receive your food. Not necessary bad, since it's a novelty place, it's not supposed to have plates (?) It still would have been nice though.

Our total of: 1 burger, 1 side of fries, 2 corndogs & 1 small soda came to $19. Could have felt like we got a little more value if we got a little more food. But it was ok, it's more like a 3.5, but I'll round it up since it's fairly new."}
{"text":"5 pm Saturday and they ran out of ribs. This kind of threw the whole experience off. We were with another couple and hungry or I'd have been for leaving right there. Ordered the Brisket sandwich on the Kids/Senior menu. Deal of the century! Sandwich wasn't that big, but it was good. Huge pile of fries and a small drink with free refills. Served on the tray covered with butcher paper. Paper plates were available. They advertised three kinds of BBQ sauce, but I only saw one bucket. \"All over the place\" is a good description of this establishment. It does remind me of the State Fair, including the customers. They had real hot towels to clean your hands afterward. Maybe you'll find them. No place to put the used towels, or sign to tell you what to do with them. \"Leave them on the table\" was the advice from the funnel cake chef. We'll probably return to try the ribs, they also have all you can eat ribs on Thursday. Some kids who came in were fascinated by the whole pig roasting on a spit."}
{"text":"Up until a few weeks ago I didn't even know this place existed, fair food without high priced parking, stomach turning rides and crazy crowds, great idea! I took my little miss & son, it looked fun from the outside and smelled amazing inside! You order from the counter & seat yourself, the ride inspired seating lured us to sit outdoors! Customer service was great, they asked several times if we had any questions or needed any suggestions. We settled on a mushroom cheese burger, giant turkey leg, and deep fried chicken strips all complete with piggly fries! The turkey leg though I thought was a bit pricey had amazing flavor, the burger was messy & juicy as it should be and the chicken strips deep fried to perfection! Thought it a bit odd that our food was all put on a paper lined tray(no plates) but we found some eventually & heck messy is fun. Oh yes their BBQ sauce was sweet & tangy and so good we got more to dip all of food in! They have a full length chalkboard, a bottle and a bean bag game, which we all played although it's located too close to the bathrooms & I felt like we were in the way of others who tried to pass. They have an amazing looking dessert selection, cotton candy, caramel apples, funnel cake, fried snickers & ice cream but we were too full and just as we were leaving they stopped us at the door to ask if we had ice cream because it was free ice cream night. Oh goodness, I couldn't tell those smiling faces no, so we waddled back in & took our cones to go! Fun and fabulous food we'll be back, that pumpkin funnel cake is calling my name.
Oh and there is a bar to the side with a list of fun drinks, HH specials and tvs for game time!"}
{"text":"My husband dragged me here to try it out. The meal was horrendous at best...and over priced. Spent $40 for two people. We definitely won't be back. On a positive note it was true to theme."}
{"text":"The food was great and great prices. I have no clue what every one is saying about how much it cost. The prices are cheaper then Famous daves and the portions are huge. Only bad thing I can say is that they only have one bbq sauce. But that one sauce makes up for it because its amazing. I ordered Monster potato with pulled porkfor $5 and my wife order 1/4 chicken plus for ribs and two sides for $11. We both could not finish. I love this place and will continue coming baack."}
{"text":"I've wondered about this place so my son and I took the opportunity to lunch there today. The decor is interesting, fair booths and decorations. The bartender was friendly, fast and responsive. Loved the roasting pig right there in the middle of the restaurant. My son ordered three different sliders, an order of wings, and a rib/fries order that came with two ribs. Our goal was to try as much variety as we could. I had a ginormous baked potato. Though the beef and chicken sliders were okay and he liked the full-sized wings we were blown away by the ribs. He kept saying \"hands down, these are the best ribs I've ever had\" and I tend to agree. The baked potato was good and filling - though not as good as the Texas Roadhouse across the lot. We're soooo going back soon. I walked out with a huge bag of cotton candy too!"}
{"text":"Wow went the AZ State Fair to hear Weezer, and covered the whole perimeter of the Fair before I found a shop that sold something that wasn't deep fried -- I'm pretty sure even the racing lemurs were wrapped in bacon.  

I found Piggly's and ordered the $12 BBQ beef sandwich, which was awesome.  About 3/4 lbs. of BBQ beef with carmelized onions and cole slaw. 

So when you eat it a 2nd meal of beefy goodness escapes the toasted hogey bun onto the paper plate, and then you have to get a fork to finish it. 

I'm definitely going to drive to the restaurant to check out their prime rib, etc."}
{"text":"What a find! It was so much fun to take our sons here and eat a great meal. The beef brisket was excellent, so were the ribs. We were so full from our meal we didn't have time to try dessert, next time we will split a plate of food so we can try dessert. Everything we had was great!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place ever since I saw it open...went a few nights ago and was completely disappointed.    I ordered chicken strips and hogley fries, my husband had a hot dog.  The chicken strips were over cooked and unedible, the hotdog according to my husband had no flavor...the food was slopped on a tray on some butcher paper, instead of a plate.  My son wanted something for desert and we stood in a line for 10 minutes and finally gave up and left.  I found the pricing too high, the experience frustrating and the food not worth the effort.  When I got home I didn't feel well..though that would be expected eating nothing but fried foods... I definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Been here three times. First time excellent service and turkey legs. Second time order a full rack of ribs, not the best kinda dry n weird after taste. Third time ordered a burger Medium Well, came pink the whole way thru? Was expecting something similar to the picture? Came with No Onion  lettuce or tomato ask waitress she hesitated said kitchen closing let me see what i can do? Being that it was near closing time i didn't complain Waitress seemed confused about the special going. I think i will Stay away from Pigglys. Seems to be No consistency."}
{"text":"I almost didn't go because the outside is intimidating - carnival type atmosphere and decor. I'm glad I went though. The moist brisket sandwich was delicious. It may be too rich for some, but it was perfect for me. The pork ribs were also delicious, lightly glazed and not overcooked when finishing on the grill. The meat on the ribs came right off the bones clean! Impressive. My fiend had the pulled pork and said it was food. We both shared the curly fires, which were hot, salty, and delicious. When we went for lunch, they were spit roasting a pig over an open flame - the place smelled like heaven! Unfortunately for us, the pig was for a party coming in at dinner. The guy told us we could order one a week ahead of time and they would do the same for us. I MUST DO THIS. Anyway, I'm usually pretty loyal to Rudy's, but this place was even better (in my opinion...and the leftovers I brought my wife made her agree). I will be back, hopefully soon."}
{"text":"Theme Restaurants I am 0 for 2 recently (Dick's of last resort Orlando FL). Someone told my wife this is a great place, I would have to disagree. 

I we drove up on super bowl Sunday I thought it was close as I did not see anyone in the dining room, I drove around to leave and we saw people in the bar, so we went in.

I guess normally it's like the fair where you stand in line order your food and then find seating, I guess tonight it was table service since no one was there. I found a local beer which was nice and looked over the menu.  We decided on the chopped brisket and added 4 ribs so we could sample, as they don't have a meat / rib combo.

The first problem was they sauced the brisket to the point that is all I could taste is the BBQ sauce not the meat.  I would have preferred to add it my self as they have a descent spicy sauce that is much better than the sweet one.  The sides were okay, hard to mess up coleslaw and bbq beans.  When they brought the food the lady asked if we would like a second plate which we did, but it never materialized.

Before we were finished the waitress dropped off the check assuming we were finished don't know why it came to $34.39.  Then she came back to see if we wanted free ice cream which my wife order some. So I though I'll have another beer, which she ordered one too.  So 2 beers come, and no dessert.  Drank our beers, and still no dessert.  Finally I put my CC on the tray with the old bill.  She came by and picked it up, and brought back one for me to sign with the new total.  2 beers in and not paying attention I sign and left, and get half way home and realize I got charged 20 dollars for 2 beers, the new total was 54 and change before tip.  The first two were 11 and change.  My advice is be careful not only here but any place else to not assume the place is honest.  If it was really 54.00 for 4 beers and sharing one entree I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"All these Mesa, AZ cheapskates. Prices are normal...don't mind the tight wads. This place is pretty cool."}
{"text":"they show pix on the menu of a spiral potato on a stick, i asked for that i even pointed to the pix on the menu cuz i couldnt find it on the menu. what i got was a lunch tray full of french fries... we waited a really long time for our food... like over 45 mins for fries and corndogs and the place was completely empty only 2 other tables of people. everything was mediocre at best..."}
{"text":"OK food was good. Never had a BBQ oyster before but it was really good. The only thing I didn't like was for the kind of food it was it was expensive. I know its fair style food and its good but $36 bucks for two adults and one kid with one root beer float and two waters sharing sides is a expensive to me. Once again food was really good just need options for kids. O and the atmosphere was great and very friendly / help full staff."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love going to the fair to eat some fair food?! For whatever reason, fair food really is only good at the fair, with the atmosphere.

The food was pretty much what you'd expect at the fair. However, the prices seemed about the same if not a little higher, which I guess I didn't expect. Considering this place was in, what seemed like, a garage. They kept the doors open and had heaters scattered around.

I went with a group of 8 people and none of us had been there before. Some nice guy told us to sit wherever we wanted, so we did. However, we waited about 15-20 mins before someone came and told us we had to go up to the counter to order. Not a fun way to start your night. Once we finally ordered, they gave us pagers but didn't tell us where to pick up our food. It was really kind of a nightmare.

Definitely not a place I'm likely to go back to. I'll just wait for the fair to get here and go get my fair food there."}
{"text":"Closest to Texas BBQ that I've found. This is not Pitmasters or gourmet, but all was pretty good. The brisket was pretty damn good, if nearly barkless. Sides are typical for fair food and fun to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night. Took them forever to open the place. They need to work on some of their processes to get the kinks out. Walking in from the side, no indication of whether to seat yourself, wait to be seated, or (correct answer) walk up to the counter and order.

They give you a number when you order. When the food finally comes out, the runner has to walk through the entire place looking for your number.

Food was OK but pretty expensive. Hamburgers looked very good. Oyster poorboy was good. Wife had the pulled pork sandwich which was fair.

Might try them again later if I'm near there and the lines are too long at Texas Roadhouse but not going out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Fair food at its finest!!! This is a great place to treat yourself to food that will clog your arteries. My husband and I eat very healthy during the week, so we like to indulge ourselves on the weekends. The deep fried Oreos were awesome!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that this was such a terrible experience that I actually signed up for Yelp just so I can warn others what a disaster this place is.

I am not sure where to start with this...

So I suggested this place to take my GF and her kids for a fun night out to get some good old fashion \"fair type\" of food.  As we walked in a helpful fellow came over to the front door and said that we can sit wherever we wished and that when we were ready that we can get in line and order our food.  After finding a place that wasn't freezing (very large garage type doors were opened and caused it to be very cold) we chose a place over by the bar.  As we sat down a very friendly woman came over and asked what we would like to drink.  Well, she didn't return so we got up and went into what would be our first of 4 lines.

As we waited in line with what amounted to be 2 new cashiers with someone over them directing them how to place orders, we paid what I thought was a pretty pricey bill (3 burgers/1 BBQ sandwich/4 drinks for @$60).  The cashier filled our drinks and told us that refills were in another part of the restaurant.  HUH?!!?  Perhaps if you just gave us our drink cups and let us get our own drinks, then we wouldn't have to wait forever to place our order.  Anyways, given our \"pager\" and returned to our seats to await for our food.

Our pager went off pretty quick and as we went to line #3 to get our food, I discovered that we were only given our fries and had to go get our burger/bbq beef in another line. As we stood there with the other patrons, the guy manning the grill took our ticket and THEN started to cook our burger.  Well 13 min and cold cheese fries later I got our burger and bbq beef.  Even the lady sitting in staging area #3 couldn't believe that I had to wait that long.

Well after eating cold cheese fries and a fatty BBQ beef sandwich, I decided to get what I came there for....the desert.  So we went up to the cashier where we got our food and was told that I needed to go to a different line to get my desert( line #4).  So we placed our order for 1 sundae, 2 funnel cakes and 1 deep fried Oreo's.  Despite taking the order for the desert and having the order ticket in their hands....the 3 young ladies had to ask several times what was on the deserts.  

I could go on and on about this place but I think you get the drift.

If this place had different management it could work but I am guessing that this place is only good at the State Fair because it has NO clue on how to run a restaurant.

Don't say that I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"HEALTH CONSCIENCE or VEGETARIANS NEED NOT GO HERE.

     I had seen this many times passing it on the way to the movie Theater nearby.  I also saw it on a morning news program.  It sounded really good to try.  I went with my sister just as a different place to try.  
   I will admit the decorations are a little loud.  There are actual carnival ride pieces around the outside and front.   Inside the the ambiance is a lot the same.  
    What hit me next was the smell of smoked meat.  It actually made my mouth water.  A greeter told us where the line to order started and that we could get any open table.  We passed the booth where they had a whole pig roasting on a spit.  
     Almost everything on the menu is either smoked or deep fried, even the veggies. After getting in line and deciding to split a smoked meat sampler, we had to ask one question. Which type of wood do they use for smoking the meat.  This is important since my sister has allergies to mesquite.  The girl at the register did have to ask the cook roasting the pig to make sure, but it was good since they use apple-wood.  
     We had to wait for a little while ~10-15 minutes for our food but I expected that.  They had beef brisket, 4 ribs, smoked turkey, smoked chicken, smoked pork and two rolls spit in half.  The brisket was so juicy that it broke in half when I tried to lift it with my fork. After biting into it I actually had to stop.  My mouth said WOW!  There was a slight crunch from the edge of the meat, while the middle had a slight buttery taste from the rendered fat, just the way good smoked meat should be.  The ribs had an almost candy looking skin to it but soft juicy moist meat inside.  Between the two of us we almost finished the sampler but decided to get some dessert.
    This is the one down point I had.  I ordered a caramel apple and my sister ordered a funnel cake.  It took almost 20 minutes for it to be ready.  (18+ mins).  The apple I got I ordered had sprinkles on it.  I decided not to complain and just took it the way it was.  I will admit it was very good and the caramel was very soft even after it had already cooled.  My sisters funnel cake was probably twice the size a normal funnel cake would be so even though the prices were similar to fair food the amount you get is pretty good.

So to sum up really good food, interesting if not a little cheesy decorations, pretty decent prices for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"This place is terrific!  Make sure you are having a cheat day from your diet that's for sure.  You walk in and you're greeted by the guy who smokes the meat.  He asks if you've ever been there before and explains the entire set up if you haven't.  You go up to the counter to order and the staff comes out to answer questions about the menu.  They are also well versed in the story of how Piggly's came to be.  Which was great.  We ordered dinner and also a funnel cake to get later.  Our food came up and we were literally in heaven.  This was the best fried food I think I've ever had.  It lives up to its name for sure.  I felt like I was at the fair minus the carnies.  We ate our meal and the woman who took our order came over to make sure we got our funnel cake which we hadn't.  We were really happy to have such great service and yummy food.  We have relayed the great review to friends and they are all lining up to go as well.  This place is a new favorite for us."}
{"text":"The food was average.. But the waitress was nice but very inattentive took her awhile to check on us then she disappeared for 10 minutes. It smelt like a farm in there. I got the Stuffed potato with chili and cheese not very good. Probably not going to return due to lack of service. Took them almost 15 minutes after giving us our order to bring out the rest of the order they forgot."}
{"text":"If you want to develop a bowel problem, eat at Piggly's!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ, had ribs and the battered fries. All great. Can't wait to go on whole hog day. Thank you Piggly's!"}
{"text":"We've been to Pigley's several times now, and always sit at the bar. The atmosphere is very fun and the decor is family friendly. The female bartender makes the best Bloody Mary! We usually order the JoJo's Hot Wings, they are fabulous! The staff is friendly! I would highly recommend Pigley's for a fun dining experience."}
{"text":"Ribs were smokey, zesty and awesome, fresh lemonade was perfectly sweet and tangy, atmosphere was great: customer service, cleanliness and the setting! Just like being at the fair, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmm. The cornbread was some good comfort food. The mac and cheese was also pretty great!  The chicken strips, however were kind of greasy, less crispy. Next time I'll get the corn dog...for sure."}
{"text":"The smell of smoking meat drew us across the parking lot, when the kids saw the Tilt-a-Whirl tables, we decided to give it a try. I ordered the half chicken with a baked potato and cowboy beans.  The chicken was ok, a little dry but not the worst I ever had. The potato and beans were ok as well, beans could use a makeover on flavor and portion size for sure. 

The kids all got the pork sandwiches with fries, creamed corn and Mac and cheese.  The fries and creamed corn were a huge hit with them, the Mac and Cheese was very dry shells with no creaminess to it at all. Sent that back for more corn.  

Their pork sandwiches were once again ok, but the flavor failed to deliver the smoke that drew us in.

The cornbread was possibly the driest I ever had and stay far away from the little salad bar.

Would I come back? I do t think so, too many other great BBQ options to settle for OK.

A+ on the service! very nice young lady and attentive."}
{"text":"All the employees were nice. It was our first time there and the guy who greeted us helped us out with their menu and what we needed to do once we were ready to order. They have everything from the fair! Now I don't have to wait for the renaissance festival or the state fair for the big turkey legs or funnel cake! They also have a full pig roasting an it smelled delicious! We could smell it when we were at AMC. 

The only bad part about it was the prices. They're just as high as it would be at the fair if not a little more. 

But overall I really enjoyed it! I will go back again!"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time last week in mesa az.
Without a doubt, the most confusing menu ever!!  confusing to the point of employees having to explain how to place an order. The food on the tray was unimpressive as were my girlfriends ribs.
The sides were small
My burger was good.....but for dang near 40.00 for two people....never again.
10 bucks a head is more like it."}
{"text":"Not as good as I thought it would be. Could be good but needs a lot of work. I hope they figure it out because I hate going to the fair but I love fair food. Ambiance was nice and the staff was friendly. Like other people said I felt like I overpaid for what I got. The food could have been better. The ribs were way over priced and not good. should have gone to charlestons instead. probably good if you just stick to the fried stuff. Probably wont be back unless I get an itch for a deep fried snickers bar or see that things have started to improve."}
{"text":"I guess according to other reviews this is hit or miss. The following review has nothing to do with our server, she was great. But there were too many things wrong with the food for me to ignore :( our wings looked great on the one side but they were charred on the bottom! And not a good char from a fire grill, I'm talking burnt on a sheet pan, and they tasted that way too. Bummer :/ and then the burger we ordered, we wanted Swiss but it came out with American. It was just so so. We got those battered fries with cheese sauce too, but i didn't think they were all that amazing. And i found it odd that you couldn't get dessert til 4.....? Or server offered to make it for us anyway, and i appreciated that. Anyways. If someone i know wanted to go there i would go back with them, however i won't go there by my own choice. So, not horrible....but not really good either."}
{"text":"Every time I go to the movies, I look over to the restaurant and go, \"I'll stop by one of these day!\" Today was \"one of these days\". Had me some hoggly fries and Pulled pork sandwich, smoked option. It was alright... not super or nothing. I was hoping the smoked option tasted more smoked. The beer battered fries were not bad. But come on. We're from Texas. Had bbq there, New Mexico, California, Illinois, Indiana and I don't recall anywhere paying for such little food a high price. I understand if it was mindblowing or a bad-ass reputation that commanded those high-demand prices. Uh uh. No sir. Well, they do have free refills, if it counts for anything. You can bring the Large drink cup another day and have a dollar drink also. 
   Anyway, food was ok, prices where a little higher than comparable places, and place looks cool. So a 3 star they get from me. I might not go back again... unless I want a $1 drink with my cup."}
{"text":"Tuesday Night took the family out.  Heard this place is awesome for kids.  Loved that they had cotton candy and funnel cakes for dessert.   The Moist Brisket was very good and the Hand battered onion rings were my favorite"}
{"text":"Wow - we go to a lot of places on yelp that people think are the bomb and end up thinking \"meh\"....  Tonight we tried a \"meh\" on yelp place and ended up thinking \"yuck!\"   

Hubby and I have been talking about going to Piggly's for months - it's quite a haul for us, so we never ended up doing it - but tonight was the night.  We're food lovers - and man -  deep fried food - sign us up!  Deep fried BACON?  What!?!?  Must have that!  Needless to say - we were super excited but our expectations were not met. 

We ordered fried bacon, fried alligator, battered fries with cheese sauce, a corn dog, the 3 sliders - that with a drink was $32.   The service was fine, someone explained the menu, very friendly.  The food - not so good.   The fried bacon tasted like batter... and more batter - not even that crisp on the outside soft in the middle crunch of well cooked batter, but just bleh (honestly if you knew us, leaving bacon uneaten is close to a sin - and we left most of it).   The alligator at least tasted like something in between the not quite crispy batter - maybe with some kind of dipping sauce it would have been ok.  Corn dog was mushy all the way though - I've had better corn dogs at Sonic.  Fries were ok - again - not hot enough, not fried enough.   The sliders we got were sausage, brisket and pulled pork.  The pork was dry, the brisket was actually not bad and the sausage wasn't worth eating.  

Seriously, this stuff was so bad that we stopped drooling over the idea of funnel cake and deep fried snickers - and left without desert.  

Maybe the frier wasn't hot enough, maybe our food sat in the window too long, maybe our expectations were just too high - but Piggly's tonight you let us down."}
{"text":"I went there to get a couple of funnel cakes as treat for my family. Bad idea, it took over a half hour to make ONE funnel cake and I was the only customer in the building! I finally had to leave without getting the second cake. That was also a hassle, it took at least five minutes to get refund. That wasn't even the biggest problem, there were flies, there was a leaking pipe in the middle of the restaurant, they didn't seem to care or be in any hurry to prepare my food and the the cake I did pay for was cold. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I have drive past this place many times, but I am a fan of barbecue and decided to give it a try. The set-up is nice: they have full service or an order and pick up section. I didn't know what I wanted so I went with a combo platter and took the two meat selection. I selected the pork and the chicken. Two sides were the mac and cheese and cowboy beans. I topped it off with a Kilt Lifter, which I was pleasantly surprised to see arrive in a short mason jar. I was also surprised with the cowboy beans. I was expected baked beans, but instead it was like baked beans in chili. It was good - but even better was the mac and cheese. Yum! The pork was good. I enjoyed it and ate all of it, but the chicken was the real star. If I had known it was like that I would have only ordered the chicken. I was maybe the best I have had. I will definitely be back and while I feel like I should try other things, I think I might stick with the chicken.."}
{"text":"Wow if you Need amazing barbecue this is the place to go, I have only had half of their menu and everything I've ordered is absolutely fabulous I suggest the full slab of ribs but if you're on the cheaper side get the  pulled pork sandwich either way you go nothing is bad. Nicole, the manager even came over to make sure our meal was right, The customer service is great. If you love great barbecue this is the place for you. Amazing service your Drink will never go down more than half, the food is amazing, the customer service is even better, obviously because of the management, The manager Nicole was there, she was running the bar as well as dealing with her own management Tasks. An absolute pleasure to be at this establishment"}
{"text":"This place was pretty decent.  We came here with my parents for dinner. They brought us free cornbread and it was very good. Big thumbs up on the cornbread! Three of us had the pulled pork sandwich and the 4th person had the moist brisket sandwich. Everything was real tasty and the staff was friendly. However, according to my parents there seems to be a disconnect between the people you give your order to and the kitchen. I witnessed this last night as I didn't receive my coleslaw and when I ordered a baked potato and I asked what came on it and was told sour cream, butter, green onions, and bacon crumbs but when I got my potato it just had butter and sour cream. No biggie though, it was still a very good potato. The staff who took our order seemed a bit confused and it was a bit slow going. The environment was obviously decorated in a fair theme with old car seats from rides, fun colors, excitable staff and lots of fried fair food. We sat outside since the weather was so ridiculously nice and the staff never forgot about us and made sure we were enjoying everything.  All in all this restaurant was okay and I might go back if we were in the area and wanted to give it another go."}
{"text":"Last night, my friend was telling me about this new BBQ place and that he had wanted to try it.  I had never heard of it before, and thought it sounded like a good idea.  After checking out their website, I thought, why the heck not?

So, I shuffle down to this side of town, looking forward to a new BBQ place.  I had read several of the reviews before i left and went in with an open mind not really knowing what to expect.

Well, lets say its not what I had hoped it would be.  At first glance, the menu seemed decent enough, but as I spent time going through it, I realized they didn't have a lot of what I had expected for a BBQ place.  I guess this place is a popular stop at the AZ fair, at least according to their website and pamphlet at the restaurant.  When you walk in, the place is colorfully decorated, with plenty of seating, and lots of fair themed stuff.  Their really hip on promoting themselves as an AZ state fair vendor, and that's okay.  The decor reflects this.  Pretty cool, and probably the only thing that really left a halfway decent impression on me. (colorful decorations, lots of fair ride chairs throughout the place, decorated napkin holders with AZ state fair pictures on them, etc.)

After I went through their menu, I realized it was half American food and half BBQ.  Well, half burgers and have BBQ really.  I had questions about their BBQ, and was kinda dissapointed with the selection.  NO shredded beef or chicken, and no Brisket.  Just BBQ'd beef cut into slices and chicken parts.  Um, why can't I get shredded beef or chicken? Isn't that sorta standard fair for places like this?

So, we ordered our food at the counter and for 2 adults, it cost $34.06! HOLY CRAP THAT WAS EXPENSIVE.  I got the BBQ beef sandwich with a baked potato side, with a drink.  My friend went with the cheese fries, a sandwich and a drink.  It just seemed outrageously priced, and we were both shocked at the price point. If I wanted to spend $35 on dinner, I can think of a million different places to go besides here, and get a nicer meal with a waiter and a cool, fun atmosphere! 

So, we go sit down for our food, and we wait.  and wait.  and we wait some more.  Finally, after an extended period of time, my drink ran out and we were starting to think they forgot about our order.  My drink was running low, so I figured I would go refill it and check on the status of our order.  Mind you, there was a soda fountain to the hard right of the entrance.  I went there and realized they only had half the selection of drinks that the order counter did.  so, I schelp to the register, get my drink refilll and ask about my order.  They said it was the next ticket up and it would be a few more minutes. ok, so I sat back down.

I got back to my table and they brought out our food.  It was okay, but not $35 dollars awesome.  The beef was okay, and the potato was awesome, but the place is laid out really weird.  I couldn't find any silver ware, but my friend found it and he grabbed us both forks and such.  They also had a burger bar area, with napkins, straws, salad dressings, lettuce and all the burger toppings you would need.  (I think this is where he found the forks, but both of us missed the forks and had to ask where they were.  They were in a dispenser off to the side that neither one of us saw the first time we went to the counter.

Overall, I wasn't impressed.  Primarily over the really high price point here, and the fact that the food was just okay.I mean, the food wasn't bad at all, but after having some sticker shock at the bill, it kind of overshadowed the goodness of what we ate.  I've eaten at other burger and BBQ places, spent half the amount, and had WAY better food across the board.  

Overall, neither one of us plan on going back. I will say the service was awesome, and I wish more service was like this, but overall, the whole experience left us disappointed and I don't think we will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"We went a month ago-ordered 2 sandwiches and shared a fry and bought 2 drinks.
$37 dollars? The sandwich was great the fries awful. They opened this huge door and with the cold wind we were freezing-our food got cold fast and we left feeling ripped off-cold-and unsatisfied.
We are not fussy fanatics either.....
Would never go there again.
The staff was only good part."}
{"text":"Wanted to like it., but alas...

Its decorated well, service was good (sat in the bar) but the food was meh...A little on the dry side and just overall okay...not the \"damn that is good feeling\" you get when you eat good bbq...menu is stuck in the 90s. Update your menu....\"but it is fair food, this guy just does not get it\"...I love food/i love fairs and I love bbq...I get it I promise. It was not bad, just was not that good. Sorry guys..will come back and try it again in a few months....."}
{"text":"Delightfully quirky is the way that I can describe Piggly's.  I sat in one of the booths, amongst all of the fair themed noir.  The restaurant is pretty large, and bright.  I had the ribs, and an order of the frogs legs.  When I think of Frogs legs, it always takes me back to 6th grade science, but I have to say, they really do taste like really tasty chicken wings.  The ribs were done on the huge bbq grill that you see as you walk in.  They were the highlight of the meal.  They also have some pretty good microbrews on tap as well, but it was lunch so I had a coke.  I think these guys are still finding their stride, but that doesn't mean that they aren't good.  Next time I come back, I'm going to try the pulled pork sandwich, and the corn dogs.  Either way 4 to 4.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"We went at about 6:30p with four 2 and 3 year old boys.  We were immediately greeted in a very friendly and helpful manner!  All of the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.  They served us out on the patio, which they don't usually provide full service out there.  The owner came out and sat down with the menu and helped put together the perfect order to meet our needs.  They turned on the heaters for us on the patio, as we were the only ones out there at that time of day.  The boys had so much fun playing on all the fair cars and boats.  And the free ice cream after our meal topped the whole thing off.  The food was delicious, we had a bar-b-q sampler platter with beans and potato salad.  The boys had hot dogs/corn dogs, and ended up sharing a side of cream corn which was fantastic.  I cannot brag enough about the incredible service and experience we had here.  Being most of us were from out of state, we cannot regular this restaurant, but plan on going here again on future visits to the area!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing !!! Everything I've tried has been out of this world bbq food. The prices are very reasonable compared to nearby restaurants and the staff are very friendly. They make you feel at home here. Watch out for the desert lady she'll reel ya in with a fried Oreo yummy !!!"}
{"text":"Seemd like it would be a fun after-movie spot to take the kids, but it wasn't. The food is passable. The cornbread is half a step above Jiffy mix and the prime rib is mostly fat.  The tv was blaringly loud to hide the lack of customers.  But the service really capped it off. Our waitress dropped or tossed our food at us, no one smiled, and every server seemed like they had a chip on their shoulder comparable to Atlas himself. Seems like they learned their service skills running yard sales. I wouldn't go there again if they GAVE me the restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time on Mother's day.  We were greeted immediately at the door and was presented with a rose. It was a lovely surprise.  Since it was or first time we were shown the different sections of the restaurant and how it works.  As a family we chose the booth area.  The menu wasn't overwhelming and we ordered the brisket, wings,  and baked potato. The food and service was great.  Very friendly.  One of the cooks was even passing out hot towels for our bbq'd face and hands. I loved that the table was lined in paper so the kids can color and draw while they waited and ate their food. Great decor and atmosphere.  The seating outside was very cute with boats but it was too windy that day to be outside."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here, then you are missing out. I was in there last Friday for lunch. The owners (Craig and Janine) came over to meet us and thank us for coming in. The food was great, the service was phenomenal and the place looks great. I would highly recommend this to EVERYONE! I live in  North Phoenix will be driving 40 Minutes to go there again for sure!

And to everyone who has left a negative review.. I ask you to give them another chance. They have a new staff, new chef and a new menu. You will not be disappointed! I promise! (And No.. I do not work there)"}
{"text":"i loved this place, being a native arizonan, piggly's at the fair was the best, i love being able to have it year round now.  they are new to the restaurant ownership experience, so i will have to say please be patient as everyone will learn what works and what they will change.  Turkey legs and wings were incredible.  :)  cant wait to go back again.. for some giant fried frog legs ..!!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place.  The staff is great, the food is just ok.  Beer selection has a couple of good local seasonals.

I'd probably return with the kids for dessert only.  Even then just a novelty."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had a really great experience. Awesome beer, great smell in the air, a couple pigs rotating in the middle, roasting and smoking above a fire. Had awesome food, delicious curly fries. Got some fried Oreos, yum! I will bring the wife next time:)"}
{"text":"Piggly's is something I look forward to every year when I go to the Arizona State Fair because they have delicious fair food.  I saw that they were opening an actual restaurant by my house so I was really excited to check it out and get delicious, fried, fair food anytime I want.  We walked in and there was a large man at the door to greet us and he wanted to shake our hands and make funny talk.  The layout of the restaurant was a little confusing because you had to walk to the back of the restaurant to stand in a line to order your food.  The food prices were really expensive (e.g. $4 for an non-sweet corn, $7 for fried zucchinis).  The servers bring you freshly made potato chips on the house which were delicious. I would not come back because it's nothing great, the portions aren't great, the prices are too high."}
{"text":"Not bad. The relaxed atmosphere is good. You can either order your food from a waiter/waitress, or go up to the kitchen and order it directly and either dine in or take out.  Barbecue is good, but not great.  I am a tough critic as I think I make some of the best barbecue."}
