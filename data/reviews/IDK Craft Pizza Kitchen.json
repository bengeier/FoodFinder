{"text":"OMG. I was not expecting that great of a pizza but I was so WRONG! We walked in and the staff was super friendly and shared with us that a lot of things were home made like their sausage, meatballs and mozzarella sticks! Everything tasted so fresh and delicious! Can't wait for another pizza night!!"}
{"text":"I don't get the fuss about this new joint, it's amazing! They give you better service now and the pizza is great. Pretty good lunch specials from 11am/3pm that range $5-$10 which is convenient if you're in a quick little lunch break. I am a fan favorite of their philly cheese steak, because it's far from dry unflavored meat and it's a pretty good portion size. As long as they keep their great customer service and amazing food I keep oncoming back."}
{"text":"Sooo good  whoo hoo  best pizza around very friendly place not pricey great pizza will definitely   be back  new York pizza they got it yum yum good deals"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch.. Pizza Crust was on point.. Light, Fluffy, Crispy and super good.. Pizza made with some love and also fantastic ranch dressing.. Already have been back multiple times for lunch.."}
{"text":"The best pepperoni in Vegas! They use Bore's Head like some of my favorite pizzerias back home in Jersey. Extra large & full of flavor pepperoni. The crispy crust on their standard slice is good too."}
{"text":"The meatball and pepperoni pizza is amazing!! And their garlic knots are to die for!! Think we found our new pizza spot."}
{"text":"We were let down when Verazanos 
was no more. It was our go to place for delivery for 14 years. I have to say this week we have experienced 4 different 
dinners & garlic knots from IDK. The food is so fresh. The sauce is so yummy. Not overly salty. Delicious.  Truly a tasty change. GOOD LUCK IDK!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here and I can honestly say we will definitely be back. We ordered a pizza with ham and the baked ziti. The pizza was amazing! The crust was crisp with layers of cheese and boars head ham. We were surprised at the portion sizes. Our baked ziti came with a mixed green salad and garlic bread. Both well made and yummy. Thanks Ryan, we will be back!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from Marco's, Napoli's and Pizza Hut and IDK. IDK by far the best when it comes to sandwiches and pizza. Ryan (the owner) actually delivered our food and we talked for a few minutes. What a great inspired young guy. Amanda answered the phones and we found out that she is Ryan's partner, we tipped her because she called us to let us know our delivery was going to be late due to the hockey game. This place is a mom and pop shop that knows how to take care of there customers. Please order from them so they won't close down or move away. 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Bring Verrazanos back!!! Pizza sucks! So horrible that I had to gag it down. This place will go down the tubes super fast. Atmosphere is cheap and crap, staff is not good. Only thing that taste good is the ranch still that's it.

If I could rate this negative stars I would. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Man o' Man!! New York has come to vegas. This pizza is incredible. The crust is as crispy and soft as ever. The pepperonis  on the pizza are bigger and have such an amazing taste. I can't describe how happy my mouth is. This is my new pizza spot going forward. As of 4/18/18. If it's pizza your craving, I promise these guys will make your day!"}
{"text":"I was sad when Verazanos closed also.  But, I love the sauce and homemade meatballs.   Give this place a chance it's good."}
{"text":"I order Pizza from this place every Tuesday for my kids.  It's one of the best places around.  This past Tuesday I ordered an Americano sub.  Let's just say it is one of the best subs I have ever had!  Boar's Head all the way and plenty of meat!  I ate half - and put the other half in the fridge for later because it filled me up.  Well, my husband found the other half and ate it on me!  He asked me after, where I got the sub because it was one of the best he has ever had too!  Thank you to the new owners for the changes!  Fresh is always better!"}
{"text":"I am so sad that Verrazano's closed. I loved that place and their food. We ordered from IDK not knowing of the change in ownership. The food is bland. Verrazano's was so delish and now I have to find a new pizza place"}
{"text":"Forgot my lunch this morning and decided pizza was for lunch today.  I had seen this place and decided to give it a try.  The prices are definitely decent and the pizza was really good!  The crust was delicious and crunchy without being hard, the veggies were fresh and the parmesan to sprinkle on is freshly grated!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Mannnnnnn, I wasn't expecting this pizza to be like this.  So I went to go pick up an order for someone else.  I decided to go ahead and get the lunch special.    I thought I would be able to eat at least 1 while I was there, the guy (who was so polite) said it would be a few minutes before the order was ready.  So next thing I know everything is done.  So I just decide to eat and drive (don't do like I do, some of ya'll can't talk on the phone and drive) lol  But the crust was different! It was so good, you know how when you pick up a slice of pizza it goes limp?  Ya'll not this pizza, you can hold it and it doesn't go limp!  And it's crunchy, but not hard!  (I love crunchy stuff) and the pizza was good too!  I love it when pizza places sell pizza by the slice or just 2 slices.    I will be back!  This place is great!"}
{"text":"Couldnt decide on dinner, pulled this place up on yelp and really glad we did. Eggplant parm wedge and fries were delicious. Will definitely partake again."}
{"text":"So good! Definitely will be back! Good crust and sauce... And the meatballs and garlic knots are a must!"}
{"text":"Seeking a place to eat lunch yesterday I decided to try this pizza joint. Pizza of all kinds is always worth a try. I was so glad that I did stop and try. The pizza here was so delicious. When a guest walks through the door since this is such a smaller pizza parlor it has that homey type feel. The cook that made the pizza was also the cashier and he was very pleasant. 

They have advertised lunch specials and I took advantage of this special deal they were offering. The lunch special that I took advantage of was 2 slices of pizza and a drink for $4.99. What a great deal too? Although the pizza by the slice was not ready and we had to wait ten minutes for it; this was just fine for me. When I came up to the counter he was in process of kneed the dough. 

The pizza was worth the wait and maybe a little more money but I always love saving money. The two slices I had were cheese and hot and fresh straight from the oven. The store also provided Parmesan cheese for customers. This is even a must on the the best of pizzas. Extra cheese makes everything better. As a drink there fountain machine was down so he offered can drinks in place of it or bottled water. The selections of the canned soda were better than what was being offered in the fountain. So I paired the order of cheese pizza with cherry 7up. This was such a great little place for lunch with unbeatable prices, exceptional food, and excellent service. What could be better?"}
{"text":"Great lunch special with pizza and salad. The zeppolis are amazing! Ate way too many. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"To me this is one of the best in town.  The new owners know NY style, they've made changes since taking over and the food is worth every cent.  

I've tried a lot of places here in town and there is just no comparison.  Everything is made fresh, they take a lot of pride and always go for the highest quality not to mention which I've said before, they support military and first responders.

So, a place that appreciates its customers, its community, the military, first responders and have amazing food, you have got to try this place."}
{"text":"I just happened upon this business by accident.  It was a great accident indeed!  The pizza was amazing, the toppings were delicious and there was a perfect amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings.  

I had a weekend day off, so that meant a trip to the massage school for a cheap massage.  Upon reaching my destination, they had signs up saying they're booked, and are no longer open Sunday afternoons.  It was a sad day indeed.  Until I turned the corner of the sidewalk and walked into IDK.  

They had reasonable prices, I was greeted by the owner and he explained that they'll make whatever you want.  They also have some of their more popular pizzas in case you're lazy like me, and don't want to have to assemble your own creation.  I ordered a modified version of one of their specials, and watched him craft this masterpiece.  

After a few minutes in the oven, the pizza was presented to me, it looked and smelled amazing!  After bringing it home, the first bite proved this place would see my business again soon.  The deliciousness of the crust, with the right amount of cheese, sauce, and toppings was a surprise.  I had never tried this establishment, but definitely will be back.  There wasn't too much crust, the toppings weren't overwhelming the pizza, and the cheese though gooey and delicious wasn't overly greasy.  Plus the sauce was good as well.

Come to IDK to create your own masterpiece.  The employees are great, the prices are reasonable and the pizza is among the best in the Vegas valley."}
{"text":"So sad, I loved Verrazanos pizza and hoped the new owner would not change a thing. 

Too late. A friend and I ordered our usual for lunch delivery. Quoted 45 minutes. Ok, that's normal. An hour and 15 minutes later no pizza. When it finally came, an hour and half, the pizza was c c cold and soggy. The mushrooms tasted \"dirty\", like no one washed them before they cooked them.

This is a HUGE disappointment as now I/we have to find a new place for pizza delivery.

Why, why, why would you ruin a good thing and change the quality of a great pizza."}
{"text":"Loved the crust. Thin but still had a nice thick edge and great taste. The sauce was fine but could maybe use a little more herbs or spiciness.  I'd say their toppings are a little skimpy, so order double meat if you like good coverage. But it's a good size pie for the cost."}
{"text":"It ain't Verranzano's.  In fact, it's not really close.  Still dumpy inside, but now the food matches.  The pizza sauce is bland and the food greasy.  Might be NY style, but it's not NY good.  Too bad."}
{"text":"I'm a usual thick dish pizza, but this place is really legit. I'm seriously considering changing my preference. I love their thin crust pizza. Check them out......"}
{"text":"Pizza  is so so good u do t want too share with anybody  spaghetti is like it's from   Heaven. Customer xservice is so friendly and who ever makes the product is making like u are family Perfection and the prices are great"}
{"text":"Stopped in Saturday afternoon to check this place out. We ordered a bacon pizza with an order of garlic knots. Our son said the pizza was better than Marcos. The sauce on the pizza was excellent. It seems like the pizza chains go \"thin\" on the sauce, but not with IDK as it seemed like just the right amount. The bacon was great, and I really liked the crust. 

For $10, it fed a family of 5, and we had a piece and a half left over, which made great breakfast the following day :)

The garlic knots are something I would walk a few miles for. Absolutely amazing! Unfortunately, I only got one, because the kids fought for the others. Order these, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Postmates and it was excellent pizza.  We tried the supreme and veggie and it did not disappoint.  Crust was very good, and the pizza had great flavor!  Will order again."}
{"text":"IDK Pizza. Well... let's start with the name. Funny, but not funny when you're asking yourself \"idk where the fuck my pizza is at?\" I don't understand how my mom ordered pizza around 3pm and our pizza didn't show up till about 6pm. The guy delivering had called and said he was on his way multiple times. This place is maybe 2 miles away from my parents house. 
My mom called the manager to ask why it's taking so long and the manager said \" well did you try and help him find your house? Did you give him your cross streets?\" No apologies, or help. Just a smart ass question. 
Obviously she is going to try and help guide someone who is lost. But my parents house isn't hard to find at all and again it's maybe 2 miles away. So it at least took two hours for our pizza to get here, and the boxes were kinda flimsy and soggy and pizza was cold and crust was pretty hard. Not even worth the two hour wait and the managers rude attitude. 
Perhaps they should work on better customer service skills, if they are going to provide mediocre pizza. 
And possibly change their name to \" IDK where the fuck my pizza's at\" if they're going to provide two hours of waiting.
Perhaps they just scheduled the weaker staff members or where having a bad day... but overall not great service, or pizza."}
