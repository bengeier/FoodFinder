{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for pasta meals. It is okay. But, the two experiences I had with their pizza was more than terrible. We actually threw away a pizza after tasting a slice. The green peppers, and mushroom toppings were soggy (apparently some jar form of marinated vegetables, not fresh) and the sausage barely tasted like meat. I brought this take out for my family, and no one could eat it, sad to say."}
{"text":"The pizza was great! The Italian hoagie was great! Only complaint was we could smell the bar smoke from next door."}
{"text":"Greatest pizza in town. Great service from Becky too."}
{"text":"The white cheese pizza had so much cheese on it it could have choked a thoroughbred. The service was less than substantial, and that's coming from a very sympathetic former waitress. I ate one slice of the pizza my daughter and I intended to share, she are one bite; we left  left the rest of it to sit in the cigarette scented den where it was spawned. I will never waste my time, money, or appetite here again."}
{"text":"If I could give this no stars I would!  The flies all over the place were bad, but it was the dead spider in my ice water that threw me for a loop...
Needless to say, we didn't stick around after that."}
{"text":"So disappointed.  I used to go there all the time and then the staff changed.  The service and food went downhill after that.  So it had been a couple of years so I thought I would give them another try.  What a mistake!  It took forever to be waited on and that continued throughout the night.  Several tables that entered and placed orders after us, were leaving before we were even served.  We ordered pizza with 2 toppings.  We eventually received a pizza with no toppings.  However we were charged for 2 toppings.  Then when we went to leave and pay it appears the waitress added the bill incorrectly and undercharged us.  The owner - who also makes the pizzas - had no problem catching the mistake and correcting the charge but couldn't manage to find the toppings we ordered and still charged us for them.  We will never return.  If I could give this place 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"I have only ordered pizza through take-out so I can't comment on sit-down service. The pizza I order is always delicious and I suggest getting garlic bread with cheese instead of bread sticks. The sticks are so-so but their garlic bread is amazing. When ordering over the phone you may get a busy signal so give them a minute and call back and speak up as its hard for them to hear you in the cramped kitchen. Always friendly service when picking up my order and theirs is one of my favorite pizza's around."}
{"text":"The Grande Italian Restaurant has a great grilled chicken salad with homemade balsamic dressing. The pizza has a nicely done crust with adequate toppings. The breadsticks were crisp and tasty.And lastly the prices were fair."}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good. Service is usually \"hit\" rather than miss. Be sure to check out your order before you leave and make sure they have the order correct, especially if they are busy! Overall, a thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Good food at decent price. 
We had salad bread sticks and pizza last night. The salad dressing is amazing, its a classic homemade house dressing. The bread sticks were good too. The pizza was REALLY good as well. Personally thought the pizza could have been a little bigger for the cost, but regardless it tasted great ! If you are in the area Id stop by for some homemade Italian food !"}
{"text":"Grande Italian Restaurant is definitely one of my favorite places to eat. The environment is great and the employees are friendly. They have delicious salads and breadsticks for appetizers. The dressing they have for the salads is amazing and sadly they do not tell the recipe. When the main dish arrived I was amazed. The pizza they have there is delicious and is unlike any other pizza places I've been to.
 
One downside is that the restaurant is fairly small.
There is a decent amount of seating but it is nothing like what you will see at Pizzas or Fiori's. Sometimes there a long waits to be seated but other than that it is a pretty solid restaurant!

Overall, Grande is an amazing place to eat and I would highly recommend it for anyone who is willing to try it!"}
{"text":"I frequented this place quite a bit years ago and it was fabulous. I think they have allowed their food to slip a bit and charge for things they shouldn't. For instance the wife ordered a pizza burger which really wasn't a pizza burger but okay she ate it anyway. It didn't have enough sauce so she asked for more... !1.25 for a small saucer. Bread is also an additional charge for a,second basket. 
The pizza was very greasy but tasted fairly good. The pink pasta was pasta, nothing special. 
The zucchini appetizer was 4 strips and over fried. Not a great place but not bad either. Perhaps it was an off night, especially since we were the only folks in there."}
{"text":"Grande is a casual Italian eatery with linoleum floors and bright red booths lining the walls. The pizza is good, and reminds me of pizza I ate as a kid...neither thin nor thick crusted, with a simple red sauce and just the right amount of cheese and toppings. The salads are made with iceberg lettuce, but I still like them...again, a bit of a throwback, but fresh and tasty, with a good italian dressing. I've had the lasagne and that's good too; nothing to write home about, but satisfying. The menu is straight-forward and uncomplicated, and sometimes I'm in just the right mood for this type of somewhat nostalgic food. Service is always good here, hitting just the right note between friendly/relaxed and professional. People return here, and the staff remembers them, so it has that neighborhood feel that so many places are missing. I've ordered my food to go on a few occasions, but the food always tastes better when I sit down and order in, probably because I just like the vibe here."}
{"text":"Good food and better service. One of the few sit down pizza (and Italian) places in the area that you can actually sit down at and not spend $20 for a pizza. 

My son cautions, \"it's not bake ziti, it's baked penne.\"  Order at your own risk. :)"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a slice of pizza. Pizza slices are big and prices are low. Very nice beer selection and many drink specials. Bartenders are fun and friendly and always keep your drinks full. Great place to grab a slice and watch the big game. Ask for Britney"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for the first time last night, we got pasta dinners with soup and rolls..Wow is all I have to say.. Was not disappointed at all! My shrimp Alfredo was unbelievable.. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, very flavorful, and the Alfredo sauce was so damn good! I haven't had this great of pasta since my Italian grandmother would make it for me, about 10 years ago. I can't stand Olive Garden and just recently tried Vincent's in south point, and they are horrible! They should t even be allowed to call themselves an Italian restaurant! The only downfall about grande's, is it is out dated and does need a major scrubbing! It's not so gross u can't eat there tho. We will definitely be back and can't wait to try their pizza!"}
{"text":"Do they even make any of their own food??? 
The spaghetti sauce is clearly from a jar and the mozzarella sticks are the frozen kind from a box. They must buy all their food from the Kmart next door and serve it.  I had the veal parm and it wasn't terrible. 
There are tons of other Italian restaurants in the area. I will try all of them before I go to Grande's again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately it's gone downhill - their pizza is still good but it's no surprise that it's empty here with Fiori's up the street.  One thing about this place - when ordering an order to go over the phone, every person taking your order is VERY rude and short.  It's really weird, every time we call it's like I feel that I am bothering them.  My wife refuses to get food there anymore because of it, and that's a shame because we have been going here since we moved into the area back in 1998."}
{"text":"Surprised to see so many tables and a nice casual restaurant, was expecting more of a take out place.  The floors are a nice sealed cement and the walls have some nice wood wainscot. The place was crowded at lunch time. We had a large piece of pizza, mine with pepperoni, the other with sausage.  The sausage is a sliced sausage, not crumbled as most pizza parlors.  However, the sausage was pretty none disrupt, not much flavor just lacking that Italian sausage flavor. The pepperoni was good.  The crust is what I call a medium thickness and cooked perfectly.  A pretty good piece of pizza."}
{"text":"I love coming here on the weekend for a bite to eat. There stuffed shells are amazing! Salads are also very good. We will certainly be frequent customers here for years to come. You can even take home their sauce to enjoy other nights. Only complaint is the nats that seem to always be hanging around when you're eating."}
