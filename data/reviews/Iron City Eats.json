{"text":"I love this place. I've sampled a lot of the food trucks here in Pittsburgh and this one is easily in my top 3. Their Braised Beef sandwich is my favorite with their Pork Carnitas tacos coming in a close second.  They're also very friendly and chat with you while you wait. I get food from Iron City Eats quite often.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. For the price, I haven't had better. The trailer is clean, the employees were friendly, and the sandwich was out of this world. Try the war pig if it's available!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite food truck when I can find it!   Vegan Sloppy Joe is the best sandwich ever, and I'm not vegan!  :)  Always look forward to seeing this truck!"}
