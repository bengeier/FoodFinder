{"text":"I was completely shocked at how many people were here on a cold winter Friday. Nachos were great!  Would come again."}
{"text":"Great local pub - nice atmosphere and service. Nachos and caprese salad were good and kids liked their wings.  We went again last week. I had the quesadillas and a side of tomato soup. The quesadillas were good and the soup was outstanding.  They had a promotion where families get 10 percent off if cell phones are put in a basket during your visit."}
{"text":"Passing through Oakville and looking for a gourmet burger? Keep on driving. Given, we dropped by at a weird time (late afternoon on the weekend) and there was a paint event going on. Our server brought our drinks and asked if we needed a minute before we ordered. She came back about 12 minutes later (had her back to us while watching TV). Wife got a different burger than the one she ordered but it was ok. My fries were good. One star for that. Free parking. Another star. Won't make this mistake again!"}
{"text":"Newly renovated. Amazing place. Food was good. Service was great. Prices were great. Couldn't ask for a better neighbourhood bar. I'm definitely making this my usual. Loved it!"}
{"text":"What a terribly disappointing evening here tonight. We made reservations for our group of 18 expecting them to be prepared. Hospitality was fine, not bad, not great but lacking a sense of genuine care. Orders were taken quickly and drinks arrived in a timely way. However meals came at crazy varied times, some of us were finished before others were served. Wait person was professional about it but no one really seemed to care, the excuse being there were only two people in the kitchen and our order was complicated due to split bills. Dah, that's why we made a reservation in advance. All in all, average food, below average service and non existent management care or interest in customer experience or satisfaction. Nice enough place but real work to do before a return visit would be earned. Other places genuinely care, this place seems not to. Questions or feedback from the management is welcome at drsk2015@gmail.com."}
{"text":"So I'm at a pub so I ordered a pub specialty..bangers and mash.  The food was good but I was surprised at the potion size. I did wonder where the rest was. It came out cute but this is a pub and not a fancy one... hmmm. The spring rolls had had for the app was just blah. The service was just ok, I felt like I was forgotten sometime.  Overall a decent experience"}
{"text":"Came here in between work shifts. It was Sunday night and they were offering a limited menu. That said, what was on the menu was quite eclectic.  I ended up ordering Gyoza and hot wings (I know, not normally things you'd find together). As simple as gyoza is, there's was really good and beautifully garnished. Hot wings were terrific with the perfect amount of crispness and not being drowned in sauce. Also, they were another spice level than most places which I like.  The place is fairly classic British pub, but is well lit and not run down at all. As an aside, I happened to be there on their inaugural Sunday night Karaoke. So if that's your thing, be sure to be there on Sundays. The DJ can sing too!  Not sure how often I'll be in the area; but there's no doubt it warrants another try if I am and I would recommend that anyone try it out."}
{"text":"Found myself in Oakville and my mom suggested I eat here. Classic pub ambience but most importantly, superlative halibut and chips. If the fish is any indication, I will return to try each and every one of their pub food items. Two complaints: 90's music too loud, and for the love of god put something other than sports on ONE of the tv's. Only having golf to watch in my peripheral vision was like watching paint dry. Green paint. But damn, that Halibut is making my mouth water days later."}
{"text":"The food is decent but honestly WAY too expensive for what it is. When comparing with the neighbourhood I'd rather go somewhere else. Chicken Green Curry has strange cuts of chicken for a curry, and very clearly uses frozen vegetables. For the price, they should at least use real peppers or a higher brand of frozen peppers."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood pub. Been several times everything we tried was well prepared and beautifully served. Calf's liver is melt in your mouth.  Delicious burger with super crisp fries."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly delighted by the high quality food and commensurate level of service at a pub. My wife and daughter had the fish tacos and my son and I had the halibut and chips. We started off with a order of onion rings that came hot, tasty and was a huge portion, more than enough for all four of us to share. We actually did not finish it. The fish was the star of the show, tender, tasty and delicate battered just right. The salad for the fish tacos were fresh and well put together. Bravo, would highly recommend and really quite surprised at quality for a neighbourhood pub. Will try other very diverse items on menu next time.....pork sui mai and Thai vegetarian spring rolls in a pub...wow!"}
{"text":"\"Check Out This Place...In a Good Mood!\"  The Pipes and Taps bar is located in a newer subdivision near the Walmart, on a quiet street. It's great to be able to park in front for free, at least at the moment. The ambiance is loud and the crowd comprised of a mix of larger groups and couples with a small bar area.  On a Friday night at 7pm, the place was full with 2 couples ahead of us. However one of the larger community tables opened up and we were seated quickly. Robyn greeted us at the door and was our awesome cheery waitress. The large Christmas tree in the front gave the room a festive spirit and live music later raised spirits even more.  The menu is a basic combination of \"pub food\" items with burgers, sandwiches a few salads and Mexican dishes. The beer selection is a little small given the concept behind the name however you'll be able to find something you like. The food is well-presented and maybe looks a bit better than the taste. The burgers were a bit \"sloppy\" but with a good taste. We had the Swiss Mushroom Burgers.  Pipes is a great place to social, speak loudly and unwind. The food is good and the service is friendly and attentive. And in time, everyone \"will get to know your name\"."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood pub. They have friendly attentive staff, high quality food and good selection of draft. A welcome reprieve from the franchise pubs in Oakville. Local pubs rule!"}
