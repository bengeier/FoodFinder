{"text":"I'd like to say I loved this place, because for the most part I did.

The veggie selection was beautiful, the store was bright and clean, but ultimately, all of that was ruined by my experience at the check out.

I went through the self check out, you know, so I could avoid talking to cashiers and go through the process quickly? Instead the attendant would not leave me alone and it took twice as long.

He hovered and hassled me the entire time I was going through the check out, he yelled out the veggies at me that I was buying from his station, and it was really frustrating. It totally ruined the whole experience for me. 

If I do go back, I'm not going to bother doing self check-out (and I don't recommend anyone else does either), not much point if someone is going to micromanage the entire process.

I would have given this place a five, I wanted to give this place a two after I left, but it gets a begrudging three because it has such a nice selection and a clean bright location."}
{"text":"I like the fresh seafood better than the young location. Then have uni in the tray when it is in season.  As fresh or fresher than Dianna seafood.  Also the KOREAN  fried chicken is good.  Not as good as the fry (on tinge) but you can order in advance since it takes 30 minutes to prepare ."}
{"text":"30% off the \"per lbs\" hot food section (i.e. where you make you own plate) starts at 7:30pm, however, the whole section closes at 8pm.

The cafeteria also closes at 8pm. That means no more ordering of Mom's Chicken and all other \"a la carte\" hot food orders. 

At 7pm 50% off sushi and 30% off sashimi and raw oysters. At 7:30pm 30%-50% discounts start on all the other prepared foods.

Melona popsicles sell for $4.48, just slightly cheaper than at Food Basics which sells them for $4.69."}
{"text":"It is the most authentic Korean food that I have found in Toronto so far! The fact that most of the cooks at the supermarket only speak Korean, probably explains why. Add to that the fact that the food is ridiculously cheap, (think giant meal for MacDonalds price) and super delicious and I have to admit that  find myself going back time and time again, despite the fact  that it is still just a supermarket you are eating in. Avoid the \"buffet\" they try and temp you with, the real greatness is in the $7 meals/soups."}
{"text":"Great Korean supermarket!  You can find a lot of variety of Korean products here, include for food to household products.

They also have a small food court that serving Varies Korean food, like traditional Korean food, Korean chinese style and Korean Japanese food."}
{"text":"I stayed in Westin for 4 nights and was in this super market every night.  It is so convenient to be able to stop by and grab some fresh bakery and drinks.  Since I am traveling I did not have much purpose for fruits, veggies, and meat...but they seems to be fresh and well presented.  

Overall a very  nice place."}
{"text":"I loved Galleria while it was up at Yonge and Doncaster. When it closed down and I found out a new location would be opening in my hood, I was very excited.

Sad to say, this Galleria isn't nearly as good as the original. It's _like_ the the original, just smaller and somehow diminished. That being said, I'm still happy it's close by and I an get Korean staples with less of a drive. Big buckets o' kalbi for summer barbeques, the chewy tapioca bread, and banchan.

It's a fun time wandering the aisles and ending it with a snack at the giant food station. It's lost some of the charm of the individual food stations of the original, but I assume it's gained in efficiency.

Overall, minor quibbles over size and selection, but nothing that would keep me away."}
{"text":"Foods in their food corner are really good! Same taste as Korean restaurants, and better price! Average cost per person is around $10. And the best thing is you don't have to pay tips! 

But just don't order Japanese foods here, they don't cook it that well,,, but the Korean foods are super good! 

They have a large parking lot behind the market, so it's pretty convenient."}
{"text":"Mom's Chicken Review! 
Pros: can order ahead, great flavor, nicely fried
Cons: a little dry

First of all, the online ordering is super convenient! I thought the system would be super tricky and you would have to pay first but it was surprisingly easy and you pay in store. They even send you a confirmation email.

Now the chicken. Let's be real, it won't be comparable to chains like MyMy chicken in North York but the price is definitely cheaper. I ordered a 1/2 original chicken. They are having a 2 dollar off promotion (plus free can of coke) so it ended up to be around $11. What surprised me about this chicken is that it had a spicy kick. It was definitely seasoned well. The crunch factor is a good 9/10 and other than the fact that it was a little dry, mom's chicken is definitely worth the buy. 

(The aunties working there are also super nice so that's always a plus!)"}
{"text":"This is an amazing place in Toronto, please visit ASAP, they are the best in every possible way!!

they even will give you a plastic bag for your wet umbrela on a rainy day!! WOW that is service with a class!!"}
{"text":"Huge Korean grocery selection, ok prices, and a large and bright space. Love it!  Also with free wifi. At the entrance you're greeted with a life-size cutout of PSY promoting Shin Ramyon (didn't make me buy any, but I did end up youtube-ing the ad...on the free wifi). 

Parking is easy to find on weekend mornings, especially compared to other nearby Asian shops at Sunny or Peanut Plaza. And definitely compared to T&T. Pretty calm shopping experience as far as Asian markets go. 

In addition to the usual grocery selection (fresh, dried, frozen), there is a bakery, and several prepared food stations. Built in to one of the surrounding walls are little kiosks including a clock shop, cosmetics/skincare shop and a travel agency....just in case you need one of those.

My favourite section? The ice cream aisle! ...with those Melona ice cream bars I love so much. Don't get sucked in by the Melona fish-shaped ice waffles, I know they're cute, but get the melon bars instead ok? They're better."}
{"text":"Better food and variety than t&t , friendly smiling workers/ cashiers (unlike t&t), also their dessert shaped as a fish is SO GOOD, I think its taro... at the back they have unique already packed and ready to eat food like gimbap, vegetarian dishes.. everything is good, I need to go to Korea one day."}
{"text":"This Korean Galleria is better then its other location (on steeles) in my opinion. It has a fresh variety of Korean Food delights. In particular, try out their fresh Sashimi and Sushi prepared foods. If you go after 7 pm, it is marked down 30-40% everyday. You can also go to their food court area and pick up precooked food options such as Bulgogi, Korean Glass Noodles, Kimchi etc. 

I also just recently tried their pork bone soup, fab! Broth is spicy with a hint of heat, pork melts off the bone!"}
{"text":"This is the biggest Korean/Asian Supermarket in Canada.
Super Fresh Vegs.
Pre-cooked food are awesome.
Price is reasonable.
I come here regulary for Korean snakcs."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to shop for groceries and treats. The food is all really fresh and brightly displayed. Smiling service from staff. Food samples to promote different items they sell. Cute home supplies, and beauty supplies. Really delicious fresh and handmade take-away food - cold side dishes like cabbage kimchee and dried anchovy and peanut, hot dishes of all sorts and sweet potatoes, and pre-made and packaged and ready to go like fried fish, gimbap, rice triangles, etc. And they have a food court and I've never experienced a bad meal there = cheap and cheerful and good on the go."}
{"text":"Went here around 11pm on a Thursday to look for Shiseido conditioner as T&T was closed at Cherry St. I didn't find it here, but I found bone marrow for soup and UNI (sea urchin). Forever I've been trying to catch some at Diana's Seafood (pun intended) with no luck. I am going straight home and boiling rice to eat it with. This place is bulgogi and kalbi meat heaven, but I wish I found some pre-marinated. Maybe I didn't look hard enough. Overall I was pleasantly surprised and service was very friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Best Korean supermarket that's open all the time! Great pre marinated bulgolgi and other prepared foods. It's where I get my staples for Korean food for sure!"}
{"text":"This review is for Mom's Chicken only. Absolutely the best Korean fried chicken (KFC) I've found in T.O. by far. Way better than Ajuker in K-town.

If you didn't know, traditional Korean FC is double fried so that it's extra crispy. The chicken is then doused in a sweet and spicy gochu jang type sauce. Alternatively, you can get it naked or half and half. What I like about Mom's Chicken at Galleria is that it's chopped up into smaller pieces so that everything's snack sized. The sauce is amazing and it's definitely worth the wait.

They tell you it takes half an hour when you order it but really it's like 15-20 minutes. Order it when you arrive at Galleria, do your grocery shopping, and then pick up your Mom's Chicken when they buzz you!"}
{"text":"I like coming here for its large selection. It is my go to place for asian products whenever I am in the area. They have other shops inside the supermarket selling cosmetics etc

I like trying new items at the hot foods section whenever I am at the supermarket. There are many prepared foods available to buy. They also have a counter for you to buy quick meals. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for a few years and have about 18k points on my points card that I got about 7 months ago when I moved into the area. At 3 points for $1 on VISA, that's a reasonable amount of money spent in one place by one person since I only shop for myself.

So why the bad review? The place has been slowly going downhill and becoming more and more of a hassle to deal with, to the point where it's not worth dealing with their nonsense just to shop here. Their prices are the same or higher than other asian markets like T&T or PATs but their service to non-Koreans is terrible. Their product selection is fine but nothing special that you can't find in other places.

My issues with them started when I tried to use my points to get a bag of rice that is part of their points program. I asked if I can get it with points, the cashier flat out said no, I asked if I could talk to their customer service and do it there or how I could go about it, she didn't understand what I was trying to say. Eventually after 2-3 minutes of waiting around I just paid for it and left. I didn't think that a $7 bag of rice was worth holding up a whole line for, but clearly the points system is hit or miss, and yes I have since checked on their website the bag is redeemable through points.

My second issue with them is that they are flat out racist to non-Koreans, I noticed this initially when I saw a few people arguing about ID over loto tickets but thought nothing about it until I saw it happen more and more often. Funny enough it was always with people who didn't speak Korean and somehow their Drivers license just wasn't a good enough piece of ID for them.

Since they started selling beer I've had the same problem, 3/3 times that I've tried to buy beer from them I've been IDed despite being almost 30, half my hair being grey and having a beard, I'm guessing that's a hip new look for 16 year olds trying to illegally buy beer because surprise surprise, they do not ID people who speak Korean, young or old. Other non-Korean people were just as surprised as I was when they got asked for ID despite clearly not being under age but if the store policy is to ID everyone regardless, they're not doing a good job of that either. I've been IDed once in the last 7 years buying alcohol and 3 times in 1 month here, just to give you an idea. I'm sure they realize that it's rude and impolite to needlessly ID people and then sit around arguing about it AFTER they have given you valid ID, which is probably why they don't ID Korean people all that often, I just wish they'd give the same respect to the rest of us. Especially when you've been a regular at the store for 6+ months.

That said, no thanks, I'll go somewhere that won't treat me worse just because I'm not part of their racial group. T&T, PATs, Seasons, etc will treat you just fine regardless of your race, and that's the way it should be, this is Canada after all.

Oh and 24/7 is nice, but I can wait to do my shopping the next day."}
{"text":"Heard someone recommend it the other day and thought I would give it a whirl... Absolutely nothing to write home about. It is barely a glorified supermarket, with a handful of small retail-looking stores on the perimeters. Mostly the stuff they sell is packaged process food, with a few fresh food counters along the side (meat, fish, produce). A lot of the ready-made foods were deep-fried (not my idea of healthy food). The hot buffet held more fried foods, many are the usual heavily coated in sugar and dough variety you'd find in mall food courts. The freshly cooked hot foods you can order from a menu, though the bibimap dishes (one in metal bowls, one in a hot 'plate' which was actually a bowl) had about a heaping tablespoon of ground meat and the rest was veggie and a lot of rice were very disappointing. The place was quite cheerless and with the exception of the cashier as we were leaving, no one smiled. :("}
{"text":"Their food court is amazing. I highly recommend Osaka sushi, fresh and high quality every time. Best tempura I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Very nicely stocked Korean grocery store with lots of selection.  Finding parking can be a little bit of a pain, but they have a great food court with Homestyle cooking and a terrific bakery"}
{"text":"I get  groceries and prepared foods here, no problem, and there's lots of parking."}
{"text":"As a Korean living in the area, I feel my Yelp account would not be complete without a review of Galleria Supermarket. From the moment it was rumored Galleria Supermarket would be coming to my hood, I was counting down the days. I kid you not, I even got \"insider updates\" through friends and family, on how soon it would be opening, and how big it was going to be. Unfortunately I had to work on opening day so I wasn't able to witness history in the making, but I did go the next day, and the next, and the next. In fact, i just came back from Galleria right now. 

The supermarket itself is very well organized, bright, well maintained and always clean. The service is also very great, lots of friendly ahjumas, ajusshis and Korean college students to help the lost ones. Koreans are generally always in a rush so the service is always quick as well.  The food is very clean and so are the products. Their banchans are good though not as good as some of the ones from the smaller stores down at Bloor & Christie (Korean Town).  Oh and the Bakery is also quite the improvement form the old location in terms of taste and selection. The Sweet Potato Bun, the Peanut Cream Bun, the Custard Bun, all yummy, even the cakes and the rolls taste better. 

They have AMAZING fried chicken smothered in sweet and spicy sauce, which is worth a try. In fact I'm craving it right now... They also have a really great Lunch and Dinner Buffet, and the prices are extremely reasonable, even if its NOT all you can eat.

After 8 or 9PM, many of their baked goods, and other ready-to-eat food items go on sale for 15-50% off... which is super awesome because

A) It's cheap...!!! Buy moreee!! 
B) It assures me that they only sell fresh items :)

The downside:
Considering the big location, they don't have as much selection as one might expect. I know, it sounds crazy, but unless you're a pro Korean grocery shopper, that goes in knowing exactly what you're looking for, you wouldn't notice. That said, when it comes to Korean tea, drinks and snacks, I know my stuff. The relatively tiny Hmart down in the North York Area carries more variety when it comes to snacks, probably due to the large population of Korean exchange students in the area.

Overall, Galleria Supermarket, I would really like to give you 5 stars but until you up your game with more product variety, I can only give you 4 :("}
{"text":"Last week, I went to Galleria Supermarket for the first time.

I know the other one located in North York, but I think this one is better.

I ordered Gamja Tang, kind of spicy Pork bones soup with potatoes. It was good. One of the best I had for a while. And the best part, it was cheap. Made my day."}
{"text":"I like Korean supermarket. The products are more fresh and healthy than the ones from mainland China. The  products may be a bit expensive than the ones from Chinese supermarket but still in a reasonable range. 

The special thing of the supermarket is there's a cafeteria area inside. If you are rushed for you lunch, you can picked up some ready-made dishes for your lunchbox. Some dishes are as good as regular Korean restaurants. Don't forget the steamed rice, it always goes with Korean dishes if you want to try the food in a more Korean manner. This more buffet-like way, I think, it's really a fast way to get your stomach filled nicely. 

You can also order the food from menu. And it won't make you wait for too long. 

Overall, it's a good place for shopping and eating. I would recommend the place for my friends and for you."}
{"text":"24 hr supermarket with large parking lot. during the day, food court, bakery, video/book store, pharmacy and other stores are also opened inside the plaza. its a good place for one stop shopping."}
{"text":"Although I'm not Korean but I love Korean culture and food. I've only been to Korea once and I've miss their food so much since then, this place always bring back my memories. Staff there and really friendly and nice, their products are mostly entirely from Korea, their red bean fish is my favourite and their bakery section. But my favourite part of this supermarket is definitely the food court, they have the best Korean food ever in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love this Korean supermarket. Nice clean shopping environment. Although produce there are a bit expensive then most Chinese supermarket, but it's more fresh. Parking there is very convenient, they have a big plaza with lots of parking spaces available. What's really nice is that they have a small food court there, the pork soup and friend chicken are my favourite, I think even better than some other Korean restaurants. Serve quick and good taste. But the army hot pot is not tasty, it's very very sour, I don't know why they put so much vinegar in it, can't tolerate. The supermarket starts to have sale of lots of food around 7:30pm everyday, so our family always go there at this time to get some nice deals. Overall, it's one of our favourite supermarket although it's not close to our home."}
{"text":"Lived in Korea for two years. This place is like stepping into a grocery store in Seoul. Friendly service and authentic take out food. They even have organic produce and beer!"}
{"text":"What's not to like when you go shopping and you find something for FREE?  Yes, as I was perusing the meat section of this uber clean and nicely organized Korean food store, they had neatly wrapped packages of free  bones.  Bones are trendy and so, more expensive now and greatly appreciated by my dog Sailor (the one with the very large, sharp pointy white teeth.)  I picked up some cool snacks and some great take-out food.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Open 365 days a year 24/7 ... I dont care about any of the negative reviews.

Its priced as a metro/longos or all the other korean stores like hmart
Its produce looks and tastes great...

If you're korean you already shop here. If you're not you'll be stopping by when your stores are closed"}
{"text":"This review is regarding the food in the food court.

This is probably my go to place for Korean food. The prices are very reasonable and there's lots to choose from! You can order things from the menu, buy pre-made food (ex. Bimbap, Korean fried chicken, etc.) and also buy food by pound (like buffet). My favourite here is the \"jajiang mein\" (black bean sauce with noodles). 

Overall 4/5 because I find that there's no one there to clean the tables! I always have to wipe the tables clean by myself."}
{"text":"Mom's chicken how to:  

- wait time is 30 mins
- you can call the general store number to order in advance of your arrival
- there are 3 flavors, fried (dry), spicy (fried and saucy) or half and half ($23 includes a few cans of coke and a small side of pickled carrot))
- go to the cash closes to the prepared food bar to pay (utensils are supplied here to)
- take your receipt to the end of the cafeteria kitchen at the back of the store. You will see custom moms chicken paper shopping bags. 
- your order should be waiting there 
- present your receipt to one of the staff in the kitchen area for pick up
- if u r enjoying it there and need rice, they have pre packed rice next to the soup at the food bar ($1.18)

Enjoy! It's good. Similar to the fried chicken at momofuko at a fraction of the price!"}
{"text":"This place is a blessing. Grab a box of seasoned vegetables, a container of pre-steamed rice, and voila - you've just \"cooked\" your own bibimbap for $5.

Their other ready to go foods include sushi, gimbap, banchan, bento boxes, dumplings/buns, sandwiches, fruit cups, and other packaged Korean dishes. They also have the normal convenience store stuff, snacks, and (very limited) produce."}
{"text":"I love Galleria! Great selection of fresh produce, top notch meats and sushi. So much to choose from - snacks, noodles, dumplings. Decent food court with a few restaurants. In the summer, they have soft ice-cream with fruits at the bakery. So good!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by the food court for some quick bites. Food court closes at 9pm.

$9.99 bento box from the japanese stall is a steal. Katsu, cabbage salad, 6 pieces of california roll, 4 gyoza. Hearty and not overstuffed with carbs

$9.99 soybean grinds soup (forgot the actual name) is a new item at the korean stall. The soup is creamy with the soybean grinds, filling, and has some kimchi. 

Great place to grab something to eat after shopping!"}
{"text":"I don't know many Korean exclusive grocery stores, but Galleria is one I alawys enjoy going to.

Yummy food in a mini food court and a huge selection of Korean food products that you can't find anywhere else! 

It seems to be a little bigger than what it looks from the outside, and there's tons of parking but it CAN get a little cramped. I always come here on Saturday afternoons, and it's never fun. Inside or out. Parking will always be jam packed, but I've never had trouble finding parking since there's quite a few spots. Inside is chaotic though and the aisle space isn't too wide. Doesn't help that a majority of people use carts. 

Fruits and veggies are always fresh and are always beautifully displayed. In the very back of the grocery is where you can find the cooked/prepared food. There's also a 'Mom's Chicken' which I've yet still to try but the prices seem to always put me off, but I've been told it's worth every penny! 

Closer to the entrance is a mini food court with small boutiques. If my memory serves me correctly there's only 3 or 4 food stalls. Dozens of food to choose from and always tasty! It's kinda what you expect in Korean fast food though, so it's not exactly restaurant quality. 

My absolute favourite part of coming to Galleria though is the fresh taiyaki you can get! Find it closer to the home supplies/cashier area. They make it fresh and the smell of melted butter and sweet batter will fill your nose! Always worth getting!

I do admit the grocery items can be a little pricey as my recent trip with only a few items came up to roughly $95 but like I said earlier, there's quite a few things here you won't be able to find in your everyday Chinese grocery store.

I usually don't come here unless I absolutely need to since there's other Korean grocery stores that aren't as packed, but I enjoy myself everytime when I'm here. Worth the experience!"}
{"text":"It's opened 24/7! TWENTY-FOUR/SEVEN. Yes. I love how lively it is day time and how I can get Korean snacks that I can't find anywhere else. I love the galleria!"}
{"text":"Once again, how did I not know that this HUGE Korean supermarket existed in my area?!?! And I thought this place was new, but according to some reviews posted in 2010, I am clearly behind the 8 ball in my own area.

Intro. After lunch my grandmom, mom, and I decided to check this place out upon hearing it from an aunt who had just discovered the place as well (and she lives in Scarborough!) She kept on saying it was just in front of the Prince Hotel and my mom kept on saying are you sure? You mean by the Swiss Chalet? (no) You mean by Casa Manila? (no) etc...
It actually is quite easy to find once you turn off the main York Mills Road right across from the Prince Hotel and the sprawling building is to your left.

Ambiance. CLEAN! Enough with the typical dirty and less than pleasant Asian joints...Galleria is bright and clean (it bears repeating...) I am not Korean nor am I familiar with a wide variety of Korean dishes so it was interesting to come here. I find this is the TNT equivalent for Korean goods. Some items such as soy sauce and seasonings were Japanese and Galleria does carry some North American goods such as Pampers and Fillip Berrio olive oil...but the majority of products are Korean.

FYI! If you are looking for a healthy and low calorie snack, try toasted or salted seaweed. As unappetizing as that sounds, it actually fulfills my craving for something salty or crunchy...but without the fat! Most of the seaweed snacks I buy at TNT are one brand, but Galleria carries a lot. Essentially these are toasted seaweed sheets that one of my co-worker said it was what he fed his fish...(am I really selling it here?)

Galleria also carries other products (not just food) such as pots and pans, bedding, mini dresses, dishwashers (Samsung of course!) and special machines for Kimchi? There is a bakery towards the other end of the market and a \"food court\" where you can purchase prepared food items.

Because I am not familiar with most Korean goods, I probably will not be shopping here often. But it is a nice addition to this area and there is a Dragon Pearl Buffet right next to this place!"}
{"text":"It's quite far from my house, but definitely worth the ride. I love to shop kitchenware there, very cute designs at reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here to quickly grab some food... and I couldn't wait to go back again!
It's not another typical Asian grocery and take forever to find a parking spot.  Soon as you enter from Yonge St. there are parking attendants getting cars to move along and show you where there are free spots... And Yes! There's lots of free parking spots!

The interior is packed and aisles are small, but you can comfortably walk around with a full size cart.  Galleria is pretty small compared to other Asian groceries. It's spit into 2 sections between the fresh produce (fruits & veggies) and meats/packaged items (chips, frozen food, premade food). I pretty much bypass everything and go straight to the premade food where you have a choice of Korean side dishes, soups/stews, rice dishes and sushi.  I go for a container of side dishes (anchovies, peanuts with anchovies and seaweed salad), chicken katsu, jap chae and decent sushi.... So much to choose from!  Paying is a breeze as they  have lots of cashiers open.

Surprisingly, even with a large number of cars in the lot, there aren't as many people in the grocery itself.  Most people are at the cafeteria area where you can order food from 3-5 stalls... and they all smell soo damn good! Alas, I have yet to try it. 

And when you think you've had enough of the awesome sights and smell of food, there's a bakery stall right before the exit and you won't be able to hold yourself from buying more food.  The round doughnut pastry stuffed with red bean paste is Excellent!

Totally worth the trip to check out Galleria. The place is clean and prices are reasonable (not cheap tho), but you get great choices and quick service... AND they're open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"I love shopping here. The produce is fresh. The prepared foods are great. It's clean. Lots of parking available. You can even buy beer there. It's a great location."}
{"text":"They have quality produce here for the same or decent price compared to other Chinese grocers (i.e. their pork bones are meatier, pork belly is fattier).

Staff doesn't really say much but are nice/helpful when you need help. Very clean facility and has a food court which is nice to grab lunch then grab some groceries."}
{"text":"This review is for the Made to order/ready made food area inside of Galleria SuperMarket. 

I was starving and in the area and remembered about all the delicious food options I had seen in the ready-made area from a previous media event visit a couple of weeks prior. 

I pulled in and made my way for the first time to the prepared foods section and began to review the menu, it was slammed with delicious options. One issue, I wasn't sure where to order?!?!

After walking around the open kitchen a couple of times I finally asked and was directed to a cashier specifically set up to take orders. I placed my order for a Pork Neck Bone Soup and was handed a numbered buzzer.

The order took about 15 minutes to prepare and I didn't mind the wait because with every minute I waited I knew another minute of love was put into the dish I was about to eat.

When my buzzer went off I nearly knocked over my chair and ran over to the pickup area. The soup was bubbling and inside sat 4 meaty bones in a clear and fatty broth. It came with a side of 2 banchan and some purple sticky rice.

The meat was delicious and while the broth was hearty as well it wasn't as spicy as I tend to like but this was likely personal preference for me, I think. Overall the dish totally delivered... and may I remind you, this was in a GROCERY Store no less!

I'm looking forward to more visits to the Thornhill and newly opened Oakville locations so I can dig through the rest of their made-to-order menu (like their version of Korean Fried Chicken named Mom's chicken)

{"text":"Am i crazy to say that I come here regularly couple times a week lol.
This has to be my favourite supermarket !!
Their sushi sashimi section goes on sale for 30% off at about 6 pm and 50% off at 9pm!! This is where i usually pick up quick dinners after work.
Their sashimis are soo fresh and they have such good deals !! You can pick up a pack of salmon sashimi under $10 !!!
The only thing is that i would not recommend buying uni from there as i bought it once and it was not great.

They sell high quality steak for such good price too !! You can pick up a hug piece of chuck roll steak for about 6 to 10 dollars.

On weekends, they actually run the foodcourt from 11 to 8 where you can make your own lunch box or order straight from the menu.

After this long review I hope you can tell that this is an AWESOME supermarket!! You definitely get your money's worth shopping here.

Make sure you sign up for the Galleria points card !! It's free!!"}
{"text":"Narrow isles and a little crowded but they have a wide selection of food items from Korea, variety of instant ramen and chips. Service is also fast and one can give feedback on their way out."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the Galleria Super Market since they opened. The original spot was trend setting IMO for Korean Food focused super market. Alas I moved downtown and my trips have become few and far between to this gem of a  place. Next came their move to a new spot near steele to accommodate surprise surprise a condoplex. The new setup is confusing at best as it was not purpose built (old chapters building).
So I had been itching to try out this branch ever since it opened. Finally I madeit  here today and its safe to say I like this spot better than the original flagship just because the layout alone makes a lot more sense. Location is more accessible if you are driving from downtown and there is a lot more to explore in this area as there are plenty of things in the same enclave. 
In terms of variety I think its about the same as the Thornhill branch. You get your specialized cuts of meat that are geared towards Korean Cuisine. I highly recommend the cuts of Kalbi from here as they sell some of the cuts I have rarely seen in a restaurant (Kalbi King Rib) let alone a grocery store. Then you have your kimchi filled refrigeration area, sauce mixes etc etc.  
Plenty of other knick knacks are also there which go well with beer or with mains. 
There is a food court here as well though I didn't get a chance to explore it much but it looked interesting. 
A good addition to the ever growing ethnic focused grocery stores."}
{"text":"Galleria has everything!   Fresh fruits and vegetables, lots of meats, and a plentiful variety of cooked foods.  You need beauty products?  Check.  How about a kimchi fridge?  Check.  U need a fishing outfit?  They have that too.  It's like one stop shopping.  They have great sampling stations, even a few on weekdays.  Psy is on repeat, playing in the background."}
{"text":"This place is awesome for ethnic food especially the Korean variety. I just luv the various cuts of beef rib (Kalbi) they offer. The King Rib is just amazing and I haven't seen that cut anywhere else in TO. I also like huge variety of side dishes (I think they are called banchans) they offer. My favorite is spicy squid in Kochujung (Chilli paste) This stuff is addictive with beer. The layout is not as good as their previous location but its good nonetheless. Now its open 24 hours so you can even go there in the wee hours of the morning. Sushi are Sashimi are OK but not great. The owner seems to know how to manage an ethnic store well i.e. Keep it clean, Offer huge variety and they will come. I am not a Kimchi Eater myself but they have reasonably diverse variety to offer."}
{"text":"This is a slightly better outpost of Galleria. Having been disappointed by the Bloor location I was looking forward to this spot. Hmmm It has its good part namely the grab and go food items as otherwise I found it to be really cramped to the extent one can can hardly walk around the aisles. I was looking for a specific item and couldn't find any help so had to go and check every aisle to locate the item. I think with their competition up nearby I will probably visit them instead. 
2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Galleria is a great place to grab a bite to eat, get a 1kg bag of red pepper powder, and pick up a kimchi refrigerator. 

The food court has Japanese, Korean, and Korean-Style Chinese food (the Korean and Korean-style Chinese are sold from the same cash). I highly recommend the dolsot bibimbap (rice, veg and meat in a hot stone bowl, topped with an egg) and the noodles with black bean sauce from the Korean side, and the donburi from the Japanese side. 

Gateau, the bakery, has wonderful buns and cakes and deep fried treats. They also sell coffee, although I've never tried it.

They've got really good produce, although it would be nice to see more local produce - almost everything they sell is imported. 

The meat & fish area is huge - they have both frozen and fresh, just about any cut you could desire. 

All in all, I'm a fan. I'm over there at least once a week for lunch (I work in the neighbourhood,) and everyone is really friendly."}
{"text":"Mom's Fried Chicken - among the very best in T.O. Regardless of if you prefer it spicy Korean style or just crunchy double-fried, this bird annihilates the Colonel and beats Popeyes and Rally's too. Right up there with Stockyards for me. 

I love it's simplicity, with a tiny bit of heat in it's plain iteration, and spicy sloppy deliciousness in the saucy Korean style.  Since I like it both ways, I order mine \"Half & Half\" which is exactly as it sounds. I also really like the smaller pieces, with a whole chicken being about a dozen individual pieces, since that raises the crunchy batter-to-chicken ration, which is all good by me!

This place can get busy, and chicken can take 15 - 25 minutes since it is cooked to order, so feel free to call ahead for pickup and then either take it out, or eat-in at one of the tables in house. They also have a hot table selection of decent Korean food which is available for you to build your own container and pay by the pound.

The supermarket is also excellent, if s bit on the pricy-side, but with correspondingly upscale quality. 

Oh, and the cubes of sweet pickled diced daikon is the most perfect accompanyment to the chicken, cutting through both the fried richness and the sticky sweet sauce, and comes free with your order, as do 3 cans of pop on Friday as part of the Friday Special.

Stop standing there and just go! Trust me!
Cheers,
.James."}
{"text":"This review only pertains to the Food Court section of the store. My star rating will be closer to 2 1/2*. I have eaten in this place a few times but I'm noticing that the quality of the dishes has been getting worse. Bear in mind that this place was never a fine dining option but it used to be a great alternative to do your grocery shopping while also getting a decent meal. I don't think that's no longer the case. You have 3 dining options: prepackaged food, hot and cold ready to eat options and in store Korean restaurant. I always choose option to order from the Korean restaurant. 

There are some good dishes like the Spicy Pork Dupbap and Bulgogi Dupbap. The Pork Bone Stew is decent. However, stay away from their jjampong (Spicy Seafood Noodles) and jajangmyeong (Black Bean Noodles). Also some of their stews like their yukgaejang is not prepared properly. 

If you are shopping, get hungry and don't want to go anywhere else then there are some decent options available however if you want good Korean food, go somewhere else. Also please do not choose this place if it's the first time trying out Korean food, it might ruin you."}
{"text":"This location in Thornhill is not as nicely laid out and tidy as the one in York Mills however, what they lack in aesthetics, they make up in a larger selection of items not found in the York Mills location. 

Getting to this location is challenging as it's located in the Yonge and Steeles area and depending where you coming from, it can be a bit daunting entering the plaza. Also parking lot can get really busy based on the day of the week. 

Inside, the store and the aisles can get busy and crowded. Lots of items to choose from including hot and prepared foods, vegetables and fruits. 

You won't regret shopping here. 

Recommended!

{"text":"Yessssss. Oh wait. Yasssssss. Better.

Super nice staff. I got a free mug! Onigiri is WAY better here than at H Mart. Nice layout of store. Solid options. Prices fair. 

Welcome to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Cleaner than most Asian supermarket, I enjoy coming here for specific ingredients or snacks that I cannot find in other non-asian supermarket. The service is decently respectful and friendly with k-pop music playing in the background. You definitely find more than just food here. This location is one of the few bigger franchise in Toronto and has its own bakery, clothing store, food court, Telus, korean makeup shop and even a small learning centre where you can learn about the korean culture or even lean how to cook certain korean meals and dishes."}
{"text":"This review is mainly not about the supermarket itself, but on the cafeteria inside the supermarket. 

The food is pretty good. Yo6 can order pre-made food, like buffet style, and measure food price based on weight. I ordered a la carte black bean fried noodle. It was quite salty but I am quite surprised by the quantity. In addition, the price is quite reasonable. But beware, the wait maybe rather long."}
{"text":"Yes, I go to Korean supermarkets.

The Galleria Supermarket off of York Mills is massive, clean and has a great selection of Korean foods. We came here to get Korean fried chicken--apparently the best in town.

The whole process takes 30 min but the chicken is indeed extra crispy. After paying, you get a vibrator that will ring once your chicken is ready. The whole chicken cost $19.99 which included massive coke bottle for free. I found the whole experience amusing. 

I also got some Kimchi, Melona frozen popsickles (these things are AMAZING!, taste like real melons), and some sea weed. If kimchi isn't your thing, they have tonnes of other snacks."}
{"text":"Very good quality food store. I go there every second day . Adequate prices. I highly recommend Korean food to those who want to loose weight. There is no bread, pizza and pasta on the korean menu. Very healthy food and all natural."}
{"text":"Waited in line to cash out, 4 people in front of me, about 10mins later when it was my turn to place groceries on the belt - the cashier slammed a closed sign on the lane and told me to line up elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love Galleria Supermarket.  It's like a Korean Loblaws!  I used to go to the one on Yonge and Steeles, but now that they moved to a different location (still at Yonge and Steeles, but a different physical space), it's not that easy to access from the street, so I like this one on York Mills better!  FYI: the York Mills location is not open 24 hours, it closes at midnight.    

Plus, this location has a by-the-weight buffet.  The buffet is awesome.  It's $4.99 a pound, and there is a good selection.  Last time I was there they had bulgogi (I think they always have this), a spicy battered chicken (similar to General Tao chicken, but Korean instead of Chinese), chicken wings, meatballs, noodles, rice, tofu and so much more.  The food was delicious!

The place is very clean and the lighting very bright.  I like this kind of shopping environment!  When I was there, they had lots of \"sampling stations\" where employees were giving samples of items that were on promotion.  Some of the things they were giving out were dumplings, rice cakes, ramen, and kimchi.  All the employees giving out the samples were wearing face shields and gloves.  Some people may think \"science fiction movie,\" but I think \"good sanitation!\"  I value cleanliness, so this scores big points with me.

I will admit that I come here mainly for the prepared foods and ramen.  They have an excellent selection of both.  They also have lots of ingredients for you to make your own Korean food from scratch, but alas I haven't the foggiest when it comes to that, so I just stick with the ready-to-eat items.      

Galleria Supermarket is a great Korean grocery store.  It's big, bright and clean, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"This is where I come to get all my Korean essentials. Where I am able to find over 10 varieties of kimchi and try out food samples served by friendly Korean ladies. Oh, did I mention that there is a food court and bakery too? 

This location is definitely more crowded than the newer York Mills location, especially on a weekend. This also leads to the chaotic parking situation people face driving into the store. But hey, the popularity of this place builds its character and you could always park next door by the Staples/KFC! 

Would definitely recommend this place if you ever find yourself pondering over the difference between pogi and mat kimchis!"}
{"text":"FRIED CHICKEN AND ALL THE KOREAN FOOD IN THE WORLD.

I came here with my cousin to get some fried chicken and go shopping.

So this place is super packed, especially around dinner time. The fried chicken is great, but I wish they'd let you choose between light and dark meat.

After a certain time (7:30 maybe?) all the ready made food becomes half price, which means I got some big tubs of soon tofu for a couple of bucks each. Grab them fast, though. Everyone else knows the deal.

This grocery store has nearly everything you want if you are making Korean food. They also have a pretty good housewares section (too good, says my wallet). It's clean and the prices are quite good. If this place was on my way home from work, I'd likely hit it every single day."}
{"text":"I went yesterday since I was in the area. I was hungry and immediately went to the food court area where various selections of food is readily available. I bought kimbap and spicy rice cake along with the weigh by the pound side dishes. The food were all very yummy it was a decent price too. I observed that many people who worked there would just bring a rice and purchase the side dishes since it was cheap. 

The food court was a decent size and was clean. They have a self serve water station which reminds me of the food courts in Seoul! The groceries choices are of abundance and had plenty to pick from.

After buying some groceries I headed to the food court again for bingsoo which was being sold because it's summer! I saw alot of people buy it. It was surprisingly tasty considering it was done in the food court.  I got the mango milk snow ice. Overall a very nice experience and clean gorcery store. I would recommend to go if you are craving Korean :)"}
{"text":"Korean version of T&T supermarket, clean well organized and smell free  Even though I like the previous location and set-up better, this is still a good place to get nice quality fruits (yes! to Korean melons), beef (galbi, bulgogi, ...), a gizillion varieties of instant noodles soupy or dry, wheat noodles or rice noodles or vermicelli, a trilzillion types of desserts or snack food made with rice flour.  Single serving ice cream bars by cash registers, how can one resist?"}
{"text":"Ooh, I like this place. Lots of variety, clean, the meat and seafood look like they're good quality. There is also an attached food court and housewares section (where I found some Korean hair dye... made for black hair! Whoo!)

My friend and I were mostly browsing, but I was very impressed by the quality of the food. I'll definitely shop here next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love it here! This supermarket is bustling with customers on weekends and is home to all imaginable Korean snacks and foods. The only thing is that the groceries here are rather on the more expensive end because they're so specialized. Although most of the staff here only speak Korean, the ones that know some English are super friendly and extremely passionate about helping you answer your questions. They had many free sample booths when I went on a Saturday afternoon, which was fun and allowed me to experience more of their cultural cuisine. They also make fresh red bean paste waffles in-store and they're absolutely delicious!! Not too sweet and not too filling! 3 for only $3.75, I would highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"A quality 24/7 Korean supermarket wil fresh prepared foods, produce, and other snacks.  Their gimbap is amazing, may seem a little bit expensive ~$7 but it tastes great and it's consistent over time. I have also tried their dukbukki, not as great as in restaurants but still good! Service here is great too!"}
{"text":"Amazing place with everything you might want.  Craving dukbokki or Korean friend chicken?  They have it to go!  The pieces are cheaper than H mart up the street and the layout is more favourable.  Will go here from now on for my Asian treats!  Btw the Galleria brand kimchi is very delicious and fresh with no MSG.  So happy that it is now in downtown Toronto.  About time!"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed with the service. Ordered dumplings and the cashier gave me a laminated gyoza label instead of those food pager things. There was no indication as to where to wait for the dumplings... i showed it to the lady in the kitchen and she told me to wait 5 minutes. I waited for about 10 minutes and finally asked one of the kitchen lady wheres my dumplings. she told me to wait somewhere else but noone was there. The lady who told me 5 mins came over to check on the dumplings and to both our surprise she didnt make it and told me wait until 5 mins ... i waited and she gave me shrimp dumplings and i hate shrimp dumplings. I didnt even notice the label said \"shrimp dumpling\" on it. The cashier did not even ask me what kind of dumplings i wanted and just gave it to me. It was bad of me for now reading the label properly ugh"}
{"text":"You can also get fairly decent Korean food by the pound at the \"cafeteria\" like buffet at Galleria Supermarket.  For $7 including taxes, you'll stuff yourself silly.  Pretty decent selection too.  The glass noodles and beef are a usual standard here.  There's also regular offering of sweet sour pork / chicken.  Love the veg offerings as its the potpourri of side dishes you'd get when you order BiBimBap at a restaurant.

They also have a hot food selection and you can get fresh hand made dumplings, or korean noodles/pork bone soup.  They've recently expanded their menu.   

More importantly they make fresh Korean Fish Cakes.  These little bad boys have NOTHING to do with fish other than being shaped into one.  It's like a crispy waffle with red bean paste on the inside and it's a dessert.  Mind you.. it's Asian dessert so don't go expecting chocolate or something, but they're one of my new favourite things.

And on the way out you can pick up some Hodo Kwajas (aka Walnut Cake aka Korean TimBits)."}
{"text":"Very Clean!  Doesn't smell fishy or anything like most asian supermarket. But I'll have to say I still prefer the the layout and food selection in their food court from their previous location."}
{"text":"The good things about this Supermarket are as follows:
1.  Open 24/7.  If you need something late at night, you can always count on Galleria
2.  Great hot meals sale. They have so many varieties of hot food and they're great when they are discounted. I go here for food when I don't have the time to make something. It's great for the price.
3.  The little restaurants and cafeteria. They have korean restaurants right beside the counters and they are great. Options include soups, sushi, noodles, etc. I love going to Wow Korean Restaurant because their soups come at a great price (between $6.99 to $8. 99). Please note that these restaurants are not open 24/7
4.  They have great Korean snacks that you can't find everywhere else. My favourite is the Toppoki chips. 
5.  They have baked good sections with so many varieties of bread. They have pizza bread, which I usually get when I don't have time to cook my meals. They have sweet breads and many more.

Here are a couple of not so great points about this supermarket:
1. The products are a bit pricey if you compare it to T&T and other asian grocery stores
2.  Parking isn't that great. Either you park really close or you park farther away. You never find good spots because it's always so busy.
3.  You can't really find Chinese or other asian products here. Almost all products are Korean...well, because it's a Korean grocery store. But something as simple as spring roll papers, I was unable to find last time. This supermarket's target market are obviously Koreans. But a lot of Asians go here too...so I think other basic Asian products should be sold here.

Overall, it's a clean place with many products. Open 24/7 and have great deals on hot food."}
{"text":"I found my favorite Korean style cream cake here and I also got a very good cooking pot (lovely pumpkin color).

Other than the cream cake and I can't say I am very impressed with the food there. Actually, I am impressed for the many kind they have, but it is just hard to pick up something I would like to buy and  also I don't like their Kimchi.....

In general they have more variety than most of the Korean super market, but for people live in North York if what you are looking for is just food, I will prefer the H mart in your neighborhood."}
{"text":"The disappointment of seeing those \"Beer Here\" signs all lit up in the dark night sky only to find out that they stopped selling that tasty beverage at 5:30pm. Good deals on soup though!"}
{"text":"This review is for the food court only. 

Coming from Orlando, a place deprived of Korean food options, my (Korean) wife and I were like kids in a candy store at this food court. It was so good that we had to come back the next day to try other dishes. Almost everything (see pictures) we had was very tasty considering that it is a food court. My favorite was the pork bone soup, The only let down was the naengmyun, which seemed subpar. We also introduced this place to our uncle, and now he stops by regularly to eat."}
{"text":"Just recently open and already good selection of products, the employees are polite and the store is well organize and clean."}
{"text":"Love having a large Korean grocery store close by. It's not your typical asian grocery store because it's pretty expensive and super nice in here. But if you ever craving any Korean food or need any ingredients, come here. They serve hot fast Korean food and Mama's fried chicken. So good!!! They also have one of the freshest sashimi sold at 20% off if you go after 8pm. I usually come here only for the quick eats because their regular grocery items are pretty pricey. Plenty of parking and the best part is that it opens till 11pm."}
{"text":"This is not the store you can come in and just pick up one thing. Unless I stay focused, I usually am distracted with all the good food. 

One thing for sure, is that the place is clean and neat. All the produce is stocked like someone with OCD had to do it. 
Although a lot of the Asian produce is being sold here, remember this is a Korean supermarket. Bean sprouts and cabbage is cheap, but other chinese veggies may not be. 
Apples are quite expensive at least $1.50/lb. 

If you're also looking for Asian snacks, you can find Japanese and Korean nibbles here, but chinese ones are hard to find. 

I was also looking for chicken today, but unless I got an organic whole chicken, it was of no avail. They have lots of beef short ribs (yum hard to resist) either marinated ($23+) or not ($18+), and pork. 

I really like the hot food section, and I can take home a huge container of bulgolgi for $5."}
{"text":"It is hard to give this supermarket a rating because it's so inconsistent.  There are some things that are excellent and others that need improving.

I mainly come here for the prepared foods.  There's a very large selection.  I love the pancakes including mushroom, shrimp and the ones made with pollock.  But, avoid the Korean style meatballs!  They say they are made with beef but they don't taste right.  The Korean BBQ in a cup is a good value.  Too bad about the cold clump of rice at the bottom of the cup which is hard, dry and tasteless even when warmed.

When entering, it is difficult to get past the check out area with the large grocery cart provided. If there's a designated entrance that avoids this busy area, I haven't found it.  

The parking lot is so congested it feels dangerous to get in and out.  It's safer to park in the KFC lot next door."}
{"text":"My god, this place is awesome.  As a grocery store, it's clean, has all your Korean needs and quite often there are samples being given out.  It's big, prices for the most part are fair and all prepared food reduces in price after 7:30pm (hot food, sushi, kimbap) yum.  The best part of this place is that it has a cafeteria that will make various Korean dishes for not nearly what they would charge you at a nice Korean restaurant and yet the dishes taste just as good or in some cases, even better.  The pork bone soup for example, this place has given me the tastiest one I have ever had so far and I've had quite a few now.  The make-your-own lunch isn't bad either except you have to be smart about what you want.  For example, me being not so smart I grabbed some macaroni salad, why that?  I have no idea.  This was a crappy macaroni salad and it was heavy so it just added weight to my dish and made it more expensive.... lame.  Luckily it was after 7:30pm so 50% off!!!!!  
When buying food from the cafeteria, I highly suggest some of the combos.  One I've gotten before was $12 and I got a single serving of jajangmyun (which is gigantic and overfilled 2 of us) as well as some sweet and sour pork (deep fried and I would say more sweet than sour).  This meal alone will more than fill 2 of you and I've got to say, the jajangmyun is incredible.  My only regret is I wore a white shirt and sauce got on it.... it won't come off :(  The naengmyeon isn't bad either but you might as well just buy the packages and make it yourself..... other than the egg and cucumber and one slice of pork you get with it I'm convinced they are just using the package.  That being said, it's delicious especially on a hot day.
Cheap Asian food is a weakness of mine and this place is making me fat.  Is it worth it though?  Absolutely.  Give it a try and if you can wait till after 7:30pm, I would say do it and eat like crazy!"}
{"text":"Kind of like a Korean T&T, many great Korean food selections here as well as fresh food. Had the food court food as well as the red bean waffle which was very good. Its not very big inside but the food is great and people are nice."}
{"text":"Red bean waffles here are so good! Crispy on the outside and soft and sweet inside. Lots of Red bean too"}
{"text":"I come here for grocery and quite often for lunch. They have good selection of hot ready to eat items."}
{"text":"This is the newer bigger version of Galleria and has a much bigger parking lot than the one on Yonge street.  

While this is on the pricier side of Asian grocery stores, this place is much cleaner and very well organized.  In addition, fruits and vegetables look much fresher than T&T. Their Korean side dish section is also huge and you can buy certain dishes at 4 for $9.99 or 3 for 9.99 (these ones are bigger). 

They also have a big food court/dining/baked good areas which is kept clean as well and has your few Korean staple foods such as PBS, Soon Tofu and KFC.

Verdict: Great change of pace from Foody Mart, T&T and a much more enjoyable shopping experience if you're willing to pay a bit of a premium."}
{"text":"I love stopping by Galleria whenever I'm in the area. 

While some of the groceries are a little more expensive than your average grocery store, I don't come here for groceries. Galleria offers so many options when it comes to prepared foods. From fried chicken, to bulgogi, to gamjatang, to sushi, to buns, you can try something different every time you stop by. There's also a food court that offers a wide variety of Korean food if nothing in the actual supermarket tickles your fancy.

Everything that I've tried here is really good. The red bean stuffed fish cakes are really good, so make sure you try those when you're there. For $1.25 each, it can't be beat. 

I also love how the employees (cashiers) are dressed in traditional Korean clothing during the day."}
{"text":"24 hour Asian super store which makes it very convenient for everyone! A lot of selections! You can obtain a points card to get discounts off products too :)"}
{"text":"The Korean version of T&T.  It's clean, fairly large, but fruits and veggies are a bit more expensive than the Chinese grocery stores in the area.  However, looking at the selection and quality of the meat and prepared foods, these far surpassed T&T.  The salmon sashimi made by Osaka looked amazing.  It was glistening pink and looked so yummy.

What was also great was there was a variety of samples such as Korean sausage, steak, dumplings, and some desserts.  In addition, there is a video store, a food court with four stalls and a nice clean sittting area, a bakery and some other stores.  

Verdict: it's a good Korean grocery store that's a lot quieter than T&T and Foody Mart in a much cleaner environment with better prepped food."}
{"text":"Ok, seriously this korean supermarket is top notch.  Definitely 5 stars without a doubt.  First things first, almost everything is vacuumed sealed, which makes the food extremely fresh and you can tell that cleanliness standards is one of their top priorities.  I even like there pull able wagon opposed to carrying everything by hand.  In terms of prices everything seems to be reasonable and maybe its me but damn I Just spent a lot of money HAH.  Everything looked so good I couldn't help it.  Theres a also a lot of variety, and when Im talking variety, like 8/9 different types of mushrooms.  Definitely kicks the generic supermarkets butt.  I also liked how they had sampler stations and they displayed all the products used in that recipe..  Sort of like costco styled but a bit better.  
Also there is a hot food station, purchasable individual items but also seat in and eat buffet typed setup.  I personally haven't tried it, but its looks amazing.  There is also a bakery on the side.  And Tons of sushi, and korean asian snacks.  They have a killer frozen dumpling section and also tons of cutt up meat korean style.  Also great fish selection.  Honestly i could go on forever about the variety of unique items.  I will say though that if you do not speak english, sometimes its hard to understand what certain items are.  They do have listed english subtitles on certain things but the products themselves don't always.  Thye also have a korean cosmetic section and on the way out, a small clothing store.  
All in all it feels sort of like a lifestyle store, since they have cooking hardware.
I ended up getting myself a points card because at the end of the day HELL YEA, I'll be back"}
{"text":"The parking lot is a bit crowed and tight, with a lot of people who don't know how to drive, and people walking in all directions without looking if there is a car backing out. Very dangerous tight space.

The food court: a selection of Korean and Japanese foods, pretty full menu, fast and fair prices. The food is comparable to what you get at Korean restaurants near by.

The bakery: overpriced Korean baked goods and some cakes, the cakes are really plain and lacked flavour, the bread is ok but way over priced and it didn't go on sale even at the very very end of the night with a lot of stock left over.

The grocery store itself has great selection of fruits, seafood, Korean specialty items and a lot of instant noodles! The home section is pretty good, a lot of selection and the Korean masks they offer are very good quality! For a good price! 

I come back here because they have things  looking for that is not offered anywhere else. I liked Their old location up a bit north on yonge st. more, but that was a rely long time ago... I think H mart at bit up north is bigger and more selection, they they both don't always have the same items, it depends on what you are looking for."}
{"text":"Funniest thing happened while lining up at the Cashiers.  I lined up at a random queue while I noticed the next Cashier had a line of all Guys.  Apparently that line went faster so I went there instead and noticed what most of those Guys probably noticed as well.  You've guessed it, a pretty Korean Cashier Girl.  Yup, definitely had a GOOD \"check-out\" experience here unlike Michelle G.   ;D

Does this prove the following:

1. Guys tend to line up at the prettiest Cashiers.
2. Single Guy lines tend to go much faster.

My praise on the former Thornhill Galleria location currently does not exist anymore at their new Thornhill Galleria location less than a minute drive away from old spot.  My props go to this York Mills Galleria location which is tucked inside a small road rather than being right on York Mills road.  This means it has become my NEW official Hang-out spot.

I found the Case of Oysters as well as Oysters on the Half Shell and individual Oysters available here where as Thornhill didn't have any when I wanted to make Gul Jeon(Oyster Pancake).  The whole setup of the store was similar to the old Thornhill location except the Food Court has been replace by their own Food Island that offers such items as Sushi, Udon, Bibimbap, Black Bean Noodle, Korean Pancakes, Korean Spicy Fried Chicken, etc...

Spicy Seafood Noodle($6.95) blew my mind.  I saw a lady got it so I decided to do the same.  It was a complete Fiery Torture Treatment that I regret getting one of the smallest Drinks(Corn Silk Drink $1.49) available.  The Udon Noodle had a Vegetable Mix along with Seafood Mix(Squid, Shrimp, Tiny Scallop, Tiny Mussels).  A-OK

The cool thing was that upon your order at the Cashier, she will give you a BEEPER so you don't have to stand there waiting.  The uncool thing is the Drink Fridge behind the Cashier is low on selection so you have to go ALL the way to the other corner of the store to get a better choice of Drinks.  PAIN!

The excellent beautifully presented Meats & Seafoods at their original spot is available here too.  The Bakery Gateaux seemed half empty this night.  There is a Tofu booth, Fish Cake booth as well as the Kimchi display.  Btw, KIMCHI FAIR(Jan 21 - Feb 3).  My Friends that wanted ABALONE Congee($4.49) for Breakfast, I can get it for you here so stop complaining.

For those that can't WIPE their own ass.  The Multi-function Toilet Seat Electric Bidet($649.00) is for you but just note it doesn't come with the Toilet itself.  Guys, it has as many buttons as a TV remote and even more instructions that come along with.  Enjoy!

Note: Free Wi-fi signs posted near Dining Area  -  I didn't test it."}
{"text":"I think I found my new HANG OUT! Good thing they open until Midnight and there's Gateau Shop with various Baked Goods and Coffee. Maybe I can watch Korean TV at the Food Court(Japanese, Korean) and learn some Korean. 

I can be here all day drooling over the Prepared Food(Sushi, Omelettes) and the guy at the Sesame Candy counter or the Fish Sticks counter or the Sweet Pancake & Rice Cake counter. 

The Electronics are also top class as I admire the Rice Cookers($400+) and the LG Fridge w/FLORAL patterns($3,000+). The Kitchenware aisle was good too where you can gather Stone Bowls or Kimchi Containers($79+). 

Lots of different Kimchi or Seasoned items to SAMPLE at the seasoned/marinated counter from Fish Roe to Clams to Octopus to Vegetables. It's nearby the Sashimi aisle were I was mesmerized and awed by the Atlantic Salmon. The Uni and Assorted Sashimi looked fresh as well.

The BEEF section also had that uniqueness as the Seafood section where the Butchers preparing the meat was sectioned off by glass wall with a slit where you can ask for special items.  The Beef looked fresh and amazing as most Korean Grocers.

I could go on and ON, but I think I would never see sunlight again.  There are a few items I could think of that would be perfect gifts during any special occasion.  I found out so much new stuff here, it's almost a whole new learning curve and it's a lesson I love to attend.  Now I know where to get Nongshim Authentic Instant Korean Cold Noodles($1.29) instead of always eating Spicy Instant Soup Noodles."}
{"text":"i used to go to their old location, one of the best part was the food court.. it is gone.. they have a cafeteria that is operated by galleria, food was WAY BELOW AVERAGE.. my non korean BF could make them better than what they served us.. we actually got sick after eating them.. 

variety of groceries made up for the drive from downtown.. one of the only reason i go here is to buy their home made kim chi, it is better than anything i have purchased pre made.. 

I thought the korean population here in Toronto was way bigger yet i still have hard time finding korean restaurants and groceries that are better than ones in Vancouver..  maybe recommendations as where to go for my korean fix is needed..."}
{"text":"Went to try Mom's Korean Fried Chicken and remembered how good KFC can be when you dont try to take it home with you. 

Enjoyed and will be back if in area."}
{"text":"The old Galleria a couple years ago was much larger in size, but this location of Galleria is closer to Yongue and Steeles, so coming here from the South is a little more difficult. 

Parking is small and often harder to find. Entering in, they have beautiful fresh produce, some I believe are imported from Korea. Ah, the culture in this supermarket is amazing. I saw them selling two engraved ginormous peaches for $10. Expensive, but kind of wanted to try it. 

I love coming to purchase the meats for hot pot because their meat is usually tender and soft and slightly chewy to bite for $8.99 a box. However, when I went yesterday, the meat was a little tough. Usually it's not like this though, so hopefully, it's just a miss kind of day.

I also love their sashimi. It's fresh and really delicious!

The snacks are one of my favourites. They have Korean chips that are delicious and cute. Whenever I come here, I make sure I hoard - people look at me like I just came out from a breakup. 

They have beauty products on the end, many Korean ones. It's a little expensive however, I would rather go elsewhere for it. The bakery has cute bread as well, these are also on the expensive side. 

There are little shops and a food court after the cash registers that you can feel free to check out after. I occassionally visit their food court for the combo meals!"}
{"text":"Awesome food during the day, and best deals on marked down food prices at night. My new favorite supermarket!

First time here, and was really impressed by this Korean supermarket. They have huge selection of grocery items, especially hot food. Came here today (Saturday) and was pleased at how many sample stations there were. Staff can also speak good English. 

I picked up a couple of snacks from the grocery section, then tried one item from the bakery (sugar twist for $1.80) which was pretty tasty.

From the cafeteria (buffet style) section, I got some fried rice with vegetable, beef bulgogi, and pork ribs (pics in photos) and paid $5.69 for it which is a good price.

My BF ordered a fresh bulgogi with rice meal for about $7 which is also pretty good.

Place was clean, and there were a lot of seating, even during a busy day.

I will come back for sure to try some of their pork bone soup and more bakery items.

EDIT: I don't always go to a food place twice in the same day, but when I do, it is at Galleria Supermarket! Came here at 9:30PM to check out marked down items before closing and BOY, WAS I GLAD I WENT TONIGHT!

Marked down sushi / sashimi is by far the best deal! And this is not just cheap sushi, it is definitely still excellent and the sushi is sooo good!

Marked down prices:
50% off Tuna Roll - paid only $3.49 for a $7.99 tuna roll pack
20% off Salmon Sashimi - paid only $7.72 for a $9.65 salmon sashimi

Also got a pack of cheese filled fish cakes for about $2.59. Good deal!

Will definitely make a point to come here at night to get the best deals on food. I signed up for their points card, because I know I will be a regular!

Review 2 of 100"}
{"text":"This is a review to compare the Kim Bap, a.k.a. Korean sushi, sold at Hwan Ga Ne & Osaka Sushi ($4.19) -- the left most food court store and the Kim Bap sold inside the Galleria Supermarket ($6.49). 

The winner is the one at Hwan Ga Ne. Though it has smaller portion (see picture), the reason why it wins is because: 

1) it's cheaper (duh!), 
2) their seaweed has a stronger taste and has a shinier finish, 
3) it includes a sauce which makes it taste better, and 
4) the shape of the kim bap fits more as one bite than the one sold at the supermarket. 

Both have pretty much the same fillings except the supermarket version has eggs in them."}
{"text":"This food court used to be my favourite one as they provided quality and affordable Korean dishes. But I see changes especially started from the beginning of this year. First of all, the food prices increased, I understand the cost of raw materials increased as the vegetable, fish and meat are more expensive than last year, it is reasonable for them to boost the price to cover the cost, but in the meanwhile, I sadly noticed the quality has been lowered, and the choice has been limited. My girl and I used to spend less than $20 for dinner or with bulked food, but now it usually costs us more than $30, so now we don't go there as frequently as we used to do. 
The food there is still delicious, and their employees are friendly too."}
{"text":"Came for dinner tonight. Galleria is my go-to place to grab food when no one at home wants to cook). 

We decided to try their Asian Food Festival combo for 2 ($11.5/person = $23 before tax). This included 1/2 an Original Fried Chicken (Mom's Chicken), a Korean Style Noodle with Black Bean Sauce (Jajangmyun), and a Stir Fried Rice and Vegetables (aka vegetable fried rice) with black bean sauce). 

For a combo for 2, it was a lot of food. My parents I shared it and had leftovers to take home (my dad was headed to play badminton, so he didn't fill up. Had he, this combo for 2 would have been the perfect amount of food for the three of us). The rice and the noodles were both fresh. We sat at the bar surrounding their food prep station and watched them make our dinner! I love doing that. The chicken could have been fresh (they do it to order), but we were in a rush, and asked if we could just get a 1/2 chicken order from their grab-and-go station, and they were willing to let us do that. I greatly appreciated that, especially as the cashier had to run around for a bit to make sure that it was okay. Even after we got our food, service was very friendly. We asked for bowls and takeout containers and were given them with a smile even though the meal prep people were very busy.

We finished dinner just in time to get to their 7:30pm end-of-day sales! I ended up taking home a container of dukbokki (stir fried rice cakes with spicy sauce) for $3.49, a dish of fried zucchini for $2.79, a container of spicy fried tofu for $2.00, a container of soondae (Korean blood sausage) for $3.84, and a container of pork bone soup for $3.84. These are the prices after they had each been marked down between 30% and 50% off! Yeah. I like my discount end-of-day food. Now I won't have to cook lunch tomorrow! Hurray for Galleria!

Oh. I also got a 25pk of yakult for $3.78. I'm trying to drink one right now. It's frozen..."}
{"text":"Free WiFi. Open 24 hours. Late night discounts are different than the York Mills branch. Here, the pork cutlet is 50% off as opposed to York Mills' 30% off. I got a pack of pork cutlet and a pack of pan fried zucchini in egg batter for $5.48. 

Highlight of last night: They have a section for beauty products, and they have a line of masks where the mask has beard/mustache/eyepatch, etc., designs so that when you wear them, supposedly, it looks like you have said facial features. They're about $3.99 each. I didn't get any, but now I know where to get them the next time I want to get someone a gag gift.

Not in my area, but not a bad place to hang out late night."}
{"text":"Too tired to drive back to downtown, we stayed put and grabbed a bite here.   Both Bimbimbap and Bulgogi were ok.  Food was cheap and decent.  Many of the boxed rolls were marked down 30-50% right before closing.  Too bad we didn't get to take advantage of it."}
{"text":"My first time coming here!
I love walking around supermarket so I had a great time exploring all the food & products they offer here!

I found the potato instant noodles that I have been searching for!! Now I don't need to buy them in HK and bring them back :D

As for food, I highly recommend their Red Bean Fish Waffle. 
This is a snack I can never resist. Once i see (or smell) it, I will have to buy it!! But again, there are not many places that sell this in the GTA. 

The waffle is thin & crispy and the red bean paste is not too sweet. The red bean flavour is pretty strong compare to some other ones I have had because they mixed in too much flour. The other thing I like is that they do not mash the red bean completely and it adds some texture to the paste. 

Definitely the best I have had in Toronro. 

I also tried their black bean sauce noodles at the food court and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"This is a great Korean supermarket. I've been here before a few times, mainly for food, but today we walked through all of the aisles. The produce is fresh and there is a wide variety of Korean home and food products. They have really great selections of kimchi, fresh beef, fish, sushi and prepared foods. Mom's fried chicken is a must try. They also have a bulk food counter where you can purchase prepared dishes, charged by weight. There are tables at the west end of the supermarket where you can eat purchased food. You can order a variety of freshly prepared Korean dishes. Today we ordered Gamjatang (pork bone soup), Jajangmyeon (black bean sauce noodles) and Udon soup noodles with fish cakes. All dishes were good and very flavourful."}
{"text":"Just a short note to let everyone know that this supermarket has moved to:
865 York Mills Road
Toronto, ON
M3B 1Y5"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out over the weekend.  Surprisingly very good.  I love the convenience of having the food court inside the grocery section.  I also love the system of ordering your food then they give you a pager so that you can continue your grocery shopping while they cook your order.  Very impressed with the cleanliness and efficiency.  I wouldn't say that the food is amazing but compared to any other grocery food court is up there in quality.  I wish they had some chicken and pork cutlet though."}
{"text":"Best Korean Supermarket/food court in Toronto. Anything from groceries to ready-made. They have local and imported products from all over the world. I love grocery shopping and this is paradise for me. I always end up spending too much but it's so worth the drive up to North York for Galleria :)"}
{"text":"Not only they have a good selection of Korean products, they also offer lots of good quality , good value ready-eat meals! They have daily special menus every day, and pork bone soup is on Saturday so we went on that day to have pbs. Although we already made up our minds to have pbs, there was so much temptation around this store which gives people to come again to try other food. I must say that it is not the best pbs you can get in GTA, but you still get lots of meat, rice, and kimchi on the side for under $8 including tax ( I don't remember the exact price). I also recommend getting desserts to finish off! They have this station for freshly made fish-shaped waffles filled with a variety of fillings: red bean, green bean, black bean and custard cream. PAT store in K-town has better ones, but these will still do! 

Overall, highly recommend checking out this store not just to get groceries but to try cheap Korean food!"}
{"text":"Awesome Korean supermarket to visit.  Kimchi heaven!  My wife usually has to purchase them red bean cakes in the shape of a fish when we're there.  I love the cashiers.  They're so friendly!  =)"}

{"text":"HOLY MOLY I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!

Reveal: I am not Korean, nor do I know much about Korean cuisine. But I am extremely interested and curious about all kinds of food and recipes, especially those I have never heard of or tried!

Totally overwhelming for someone as ignorant as I, but I have been back twice now - here are my 5 star reasons:

1. Mom's Chicken, as EVERYONE else here has said. Mr. Rosie S. was very impressed! And he doesn't even LIKE fried chicken.

2. Sushi!!! Yummers! This is the best place in the area to grab ready-to-go sushi! Yes, I know sushi is Japanese. 

3. NOOOOOOOODLES. Just wow! The selection here is one of the best in the GTA, I think! Just amazing. You could become the next Ramen Rater with JUST the supply at this location. Huge selection.

4. Clean, bright, great signage. Everyone is really, really nice!

5. THE EXPERIENCE! I feel like I have travelled across the world when I step in the doors here - I just love it. Bonus = everyone is friendly and speaks at least some English!

The prepared food cafeteria area is great (and was very popular when we were there). There are stools to eat on, and a bunch of tables as well. It was PACKED.

There was an ENTIRE AISLE of seaweed! Whaaaat? Awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Galleria!!! Especially when their sushi and food are discounted after 7pm!!! Whooot!! I love me some sushi! 

The employees are very friendly; I don't think I ever had a bad customer experience at Galleria before. The food is very fresh as well as its produce... although it is on the pricier side. 

They also have a points card so you could collect points on every dollar you spend--at least it makes you feel better when you spend a bit more than you expected.  

Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"This place has pretty much whatever you are looking for - need some Korean beauty stuff?  Check.  Fruits/veggies? Check.  Want to pick up a cake for a celebration? Check.  Hot/cold food? Check.

There is a fairly large hot/cold food station in here.  The 'cafeteria' has several options that you pay by weight ($5.99/lb).  There's shrimp, glass noodles, spicy fish, veggies, kimchee, different meat options...you get the food picture.  And it's pretty decent food!

There is also a large counter you can sit and eat at, plus they have tables at the side if you want to dine in.  You can also order a hot meal from the menu - soups/noodle dishes/rice dishes etc.

Along the counter they keep their cold food (perfect for lunches at work) Dumplings, meals to go kinda deals.  The prices are pretty reasonable as well.  

If you need to find a particular Asian ingredient check here first - pretty good variety and the prices are right.

Tons of parking (check at the back as well) is another bonus.  Don't forget to hit the \"How did we do on service today\" button on the way out!"}
{"text":"This was a fun random grocery shopping experience that a few of my friends and I embarked on. It is a large grocery store and it's really interesting on the inside. There's a food court, clothing and jewellery shopping as well as a hairdresser. I found the added services to really be very interesting because I've never seen that in a grocery store. Their meat for hot pots and their pre-made foods we're very inexpensive and great quality. I thoroughy enjoyed the experience. I watch a lot of Korean television and listen to a lot of their music, so many of these products I was already familiar with... in the sense that I knew they existed but I had never had them before. It's really nice to know there's a place I can go and get pickled radish and rice cake or pepper paste for dubokki. Staff were mostly pleasant (except for the older lady giving samples of something out near the dubokki... she literally yelled at my bf to go go go, as I was trying to grab a package of pickled radish from the refrigerator across from her. Didn't know where we were supposed to go... as there were four other people in front of us, with carts. Called her rude and then she started to bitch in Korean, which we understood. Kinda Racist & Ignorant. Staff needs some training. - 1 *. Just because we don't look Korean, doesn't mean we don't understand your language.). It is a very well kept and clean establishment. It's very very very busy and the parking lot is just as busy as the inside of the grocery store... so be prepared to walk slowly and wait for parking.
They have a good mixture of products from Korea, Japan, Taiwan. We decided to just buy and try whatever we thought looked interesting. 
They also have a lot of Pocky and Japanese Kit Kat flavors.
In all it was a fun experience and we will certainly be back to try new products."}
{"text":"I came here last week, in search of Korean BB cream (specifically one by skin79).  I had no idea this place was here!  The cafeteria smelled amazing!  They didn't have the item I was looking for, but I did end up picking up some korean face masks, and a glass water jug (I was looking for one of these!)  I will totally come back, now that I know where this place is!"}
{"text":"I like coming here when I'm in the neighbourhood.  I'm not here frequently, but I still really like it.
I usually pick up some kind of noodles, since there's aisles of noodles to choose from.  I also usually buy kimchi, and the little appetizers (that I call kimchi but come in a variety of flavours).  It's also a good place to pick up bathroom necessities.  I buy my body scrub towels from here too.  It's great.

The parking situation can be messy, but at least its easy to find the entrance and exit."}
{"text":"I love their red bean fish cakes!!! $5 for 8!

I also like the food court inside the supermarket for lunch. Under $10 you will be stuffed. Their pre-cooked meals are great too. If you like pogo-sticks, try the fish-sticks with either hot dogs, crab meat, or rice cake for $1 each.

This place is very clean and well organized too. I always drop by when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"For lunch and ate the pork bone soup and spicy Seafood noodle soup.

Quite standard fare for Korean cuisine in a food court setting. Food was very fresh and very hot. There was also self serve kimchi radish and bean sprouts available.

Bones in the pork bone soup was very tender and fall off the bone. Soup was not that salty or spicy. In the spicy Seafood noodle soup there was a lot of seafood inside. Noodles were very chewy.

For what you pay you got quite a lot of food and he can feed three people."}
{"text":"I know this might be random but I have done a lot of research for my wife for sanitary pads. Instead of toxic commercial ones we switched her to natural cotton pads. But cheapest is loblaws for 4.50 for box of 10 Natracare which isn't fully cotton from what I heard. But found one here by Lilian  which from what I read is 100% cotton. 14-16 in a pack for 7.99 but got them on a 1+1 sale so it's quite a good deal. Was hard to find information in English since the product info was too complicated for my limited Korean vocab. But found a link here from another site.

{"text":"Good supermarket. Various kinds of Korean products and prepared food can be found in this market. Prices are reasonable, especially those store-made food, much cheaper than some Korean restaurants but really delicious. It also provides some public seats for little restaurants inside the market to make customers dinning conveniently."}
{"text":"This Korean Supermarket is very bright, clean and smells great. They have a large variety of products there. Every time I go there, I usually try to pick items I haven't tried before. 

I always try to get my hands on the Korean Red Bean Fish Shaped Pastries. They have a little stall near the cash registers. Made to order, so super fresh and taste the best only when fresh. It's like a red bean filled crispy waffle with a buttery taste. My all time favourite snack to get everytime I'm there. But unfortunately this time the person making them, was going on lunch break so I didn't get any today :(

Items I bought today:

1. Korean Crispy Fried Chicken $9.99
Their recipe is very good. I like plain Jane fried chicken. It was really crispy and super moist inside. It is also lightly seasoned, not too salty just right for my taste. Comes with a little container of pickled radish to cut the grease too.

2. Spicy Salmon Roll  $6.98
This is basically a Spicy Salmon Maki Sushi Roll. It was really good, and the heat is there, but it's ok for me because I have a high spice toleration. 

3. Herb Pork $10.98
This is very similar to a Chinese Chiu Chow Dish which is also Pork Shoulder Braised in a Sauce. It is then sliced thinly and eaten cold with condiments and rice. The Korean version is ok but I prefer the chiu chow version more, where it comes with a vinegar garlic sauce to dip the meat in.

4. Spicy & Honey Butter Chicken Combo $7.98
This dish can also be eaten cold and hot. When it's cold it's also really crispy. A tad too sweet eaten alone, but great with rice. 

5. Korean Hot Bean Paste
I usually buy this to cook with. Either I add it to a broth for a spicy undertone. Or make my own Kimchi or Bibimbap, I can add the paste in. Great to have around the house."}
{"text":"Very nice place, loved their food court.
But some of the workers were not so polite.. not sure if its a canadian thing but they dont even greet you when you approach them and this odd kitchen lady came up to me and told me that i cant use snapchat unless i get a permission from the manager lol"}
{"text":"Got here with some friends after dinner to get some red bean fish. Unfortunately the stand was closed and had to get some that were made a while ago."}
{"text":"I love Asian supermarkets because of all the prepackaged/prepared food options, and Galleria is no exception.

We got some KFC (Korean fried chicken) from Mom's Chicken, a freshly made jajangmyeon (noodles with black bean sauce), prepackaged Korean rice balls, and a box of taiyaki from Kevin's Taiyaki. Portions were generous for the prices and everything was super yummy, even when eaten as cold leftovers! 

There's also a buffet and a bakery section that I didn't get to try so will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is my favourite grocery store in Toronto. There are many Korean products sold here that you can't get elsewhere. I mostly come here to buy Korean snacks and also to eat the Korean cafeteria food. There is a large selection of Korean veggies & meat dishes, cafeteria style. The chap chai is very good. You can also order hot dishes for a low price and they give you a clicker thingy that rings when the food is ready. There's usually a special on Saturdays (i.e. pork bone soup) for $4.99. I usually get the tofu soup and jampoong. Also, if you're into Korean cosmetics, they have a boutique."}
{"text":"This is a Korean supermarket that I frequent often since I live in the area. I typically go to just pick up their cooked foods and sushi when I am too lazy to cook. The sushi is fresh and there is variety. They got sashimi, sushi and maki combos that are at discount after 7PM. The cooked foods include gimbap, fried chicken, kimchi fried rice, steamed and fried pork vegetable dumplings, mungbean pancakes, Korean soups - the list continues. You'll have to go and see what is available that day. Definitely check out this grocery store whenever you're in the area! Oh and they got a points card. Make sure to subscribe!"}
{"text":"Holy crap...this place freaking huge :) lots of stuff they even got small boutiques and food court here. Plenty of sauces and stuff you need. The food court has a ridiculous amount of selection when it come to meals which you can order and they'll make it for you or buy the pre-packaged ones. If you order from them, they'll provide you with a beeper of sorts to let you know when your food is ready. They also a wide selection of side dishes which awesome but I have yet to try them all ahaha. The location is sort of meh because it's tucked away from the main road so it's not as noticeable unless you notice the plaza sign or went to Dragon Pearl next door."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Galleria, but this location is phenomenal! The staff here are really friendly, and not in the hitting on you type of way. They are generally cheerful and greet you when you walk in when it's not too busy. They are also always ready to help anyway they can. The store is always well organized and items are neatly shelved. Best of all, the line ups to cash out are extremely fast. I'm in and out like a fast food restaurant.

I've become a regular so I know they recognize me. They have that \"how did we do survey machine at the front of the store, and I've always hit the dark green happy face. In comparison to the H Marts in the area, Galleria has better prices and service so I'd come here over H Mart any day. If you need anything and are in the area I'd tell you to pay them a visit and see for yourself. Until next time, JimStar Out!!"}
{"text":"Galleria just opened a new store near Yonge/Wellesley. I went yesterday (the opening) and everyone was excited, including me. They have a great take out selection, including the lunch box specials. They have everything from bingsu (shaved ice) to tteokboggi (spicy rice cakes) for a good price. Their shop also includes snacks, produce, plus frozen and refrigerated items.

Great addition to the area and I will get lots of lunches here!

By the way, it's near the Wellesley subway station, so if you need a bite/meal on the go, this is the place!"}
{"text":"A real hidden gem, this place has everything you need in a grocery store but also a cafeteria with delicious authentic Korean food and desserts. It's almost more of a small shopping mall than a grocery store because off all the different sections it has. If you're into Asian cuisine at all I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the 24/7 hours!  Galleria is a korean supermarket, similar to T&T it is large, bright, and modern.  The previous location was bigger and with more parking, but still the same food and fresh selection.  There are free samples, and sushi/entrees made fresh daily.  Staff are super friendly, they actually try to help you when you have a question.

I often stop by when I'm in the area.  The food court area is convenient, they also have little stores inside, cosmetics, bedding, and herbal stores."}
{"text":"Oh no, Galleria.  You did it again!  What happened to the head chef (older gent with a silvery grey ponytail) that made all the food at your food court yummy?  I have not see him for my last 4-5 visits and the dine-in experience suffered considerably.  

Instead of the head chef I'm used to seeing walking around, overseeing all the food prep and cooking process, there were a bunch of non-Koreans in the kitchen, seeming lost and bored.  there was another older gent working in the section where Korean-style Chinese food (like jajangmyun and jjampong) are made were working with his bare hands in plain view from the patrons picking up their food.  He was handling noodles, yes, cooked noodles with his bare hands, portioning out the next bowl of jajangmyun or jampong.  Next minute, he was around another corner handling bags of unpeeled onions with the same hands (no washing in between the food station and food prep area) and came back to keep on portioning the noodles.  I wrote to Galleria customer service a few times to notify what I've seen (along with a photo of him handling the food with bare hands) and Galleria did not respond at all.  

For the time being, I'm going to stay away from Galleria's food court and hope someone else witnesses the same and report the dirty food handler.  I don't care where you are but hygiene should never be compromised in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Galleria is a chain of Korean supermarkets that offer high quality produce and groceries.  You will find authentic Korean, Japanese and some Chinese stuff.  Their cooked food is really good and if you haven't trued their Mom's fried chicken, you are missing out!  Note, a fresh order of fried chicken takes about 40mins so order it as soon as you get there and then start your shopping."}
{"text":"Came here at like 7:40 on yelp's recommendations to get the cheaper hot food, but unfortunately there were tons of people who already knew! All of the famous Mom's Chicken was gone, and most of the hot tray tables had only a few pieces of food left. Did buy some other stuff that was discounted: rice balls, rice cakes, tofu in spicy sauce, fried seaweed noodle roll, fried shisamo (a pregnant small fish), and korean meatballs. 

Would pass on the rice balls and especially the shisamo (the taste and texture were both not appealing to myself, personally). Everything else was delish! Especially the tofu!"}
{"text":"Great Korean supermarket that we happened to discover by way of chance. The selection of all Asian type food is outstanding. However the real deal with this place is the restaurant and all the prepared foods. It is out of this world amazing. Selection is huge and food looks and tastes fresh. Everything is available from your Korean fried chicken to noodles, different Korean dishes and also of course sushi/sashimi. I did notice some of the grocery items a bit more expensive than other Asian marts I've been to but prices are only a tad higher. If I lived nearby with the busy lifestyle I have I'd frequent Galleria weekly. Asian food is comfort food for me and it's plentiful and delicious looking. Yeah folks come try some out."}
{"text":"Supermarket: a nicer, cleaner version of all those Asian supermarkets. Kind of like T&T but for Korean products more than anything else. A little pricier than sketchy Asian supermarkets. 

Food court: pork bone soup is super tasty and comes with rice (one of the best). The  noodles in black sauce (can't write the name in English) are disappointing here because the noodles taste like spaghetti and not the traditional noodles. The sweet and sour pork type dish is delicious and fresh and the soft tofu in spicy soup is delicious, but has more of a seafood profile than other ones I've had. 

Food is fast, fresh  and hot, but seating is scarce at peak-ish meal times."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often with my mom to eat and buy some groceries. We like to buy the apples, sweet potatoes (huge bag, usually on sale), ginger (fresher than Chinese supermarkets), Korean cold noodles + soup (from frozen aisle), lettuce (for kimchi) and so on. The items are usually really fresh, some can be quite pricey so it depends on what you buy here. They have a lot of things not limited to food such as kitchenware, slippers, hair dye, skincare, etc. 

On to the food section, there is a a food court area and bakery inside. They sometimes have the pork bone soup as their daily special for a good deal. The pork bone soup here is good. The meat is very tender! Although it tends to be on the saltier end. You order the food and receive an electronic device that beeps when your food is ready and you go pick it up. They also have prepackaged meals like kimbap, sushi, bentos, and such. Or they have self-serve dishes that they charge by weight. There is also a fried chicken area specifically for ordering Korean fried chicken. I usually get the bibimbap, you can choose between the hot stone or regular (basically cold but you get a bowl of warm rice). Hot stone is like a two difference or something. They recently changed up the side dishes so that it is self-serve, you have the kimchi radish and bean sprouts. 

Now for the bakery, I am a huge fan of cream. They sell different types of cream bread here so yes I am in heaven haha. I am a matcha fan so I like the matcha one, particularly the one with a layer of cake in it. It is a bit more on the pricey end depending on what type you get but it is a nice treat. They also sell cakes and bingsoo which I haven't tried. And lastly near the checkout of galleria, there is an area that sells taiyaki. I've tried it before and it is so good when freshly made ahh. Buttery goodness haha. Oh and they sell walnut cakes here (cake shaped like a walnut with walnut and red bean filling, pretty good).

Overall I love Korean food and the culture so I come back pretty frequently. In general the quality has been quite consistent. I highly recommend coming here. They have like a 10% discount for workers on Wednesdays which is good if you work nearby. They have a such a huge variety of meals to choose from after all. Or of you want a quick cheap meal just get the regular kimbap for $3.99!"}
{"text":"Maybe I've just been spoiled with the uptown Galleria's or maybe I'm just a grump but this little Galleria is a far cry from the standard Galleria's in North York.  

We came here a few times for a \"budget lunch\" and they were truly \"budget lunches\" with super small portions.  We ended up buying multiple items there because the portions were quite small.  Some of the dishes we had had undercooked rice as well.  

They do have a good variety of snacks but again, the uptown Galleria provides way more variety.  Since I am spoiled and live uptown...I will be going to those ones only."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I went to Galleria. In fact, the last time I was there was when it used to be where the World on Yonge development site is now.

Of course, this Galleria is noticeably smaller than the previous site, but most of the features remain. There is the food court which remained, although slightly smaller. Some of the clothing stores also remained (one of them has a very friendly owner as well!). The actual food section also remained mostly intact, although separated to two sections now (kind of like a C layout).

My only issue is that there's no good access between the entrance area and the grocery area itself; you'd have to walk through the cashiers area. One would think there's a separate entrance that bypasses them..."}
{"text":"Galleria is Korea's answer to T&T's. This location is huge!! You can find so many interesting grocery items here... from their in-house made kimchi and tofu, to kalbi beef, to different kinds of teas (including the 'ballerina tea' to apparently cause weight loss:S), all kinds of dumplings, and fun snacks. It is quite organized, clean, and super air-conditioned (I visited on a hot summer day). In addition to groceries, you can find beauty products like sheet masks and there is even a travel agency! Oh, and they sell Kimchi fridges! Yes, that is a thing. 

As others have mentioned, order the fried chicken so that you can shop and by the time you are done it will be ready! (They give you a buzzer so you can wander around and it will go off when your chicken is ready). The chicken is really messy to eat because it is covered in a sticky, sweet and spicy sauce. But it is sooo crispy and delicious!! You can buy side dishes to go with it. I'm partial to the kimbap rolls. There is a food court style seating area. 

There is some kind of rewards card, which might be worth it if you come here often enough."}

Pros:
Ample parking
Bigger selection on items than the other Galleria

Cons:
Food court not as good as other Galleria
Not open 24 hours

This review will be more of a comparison to the other Galleria than anything.  Both Galleria's are pretty great, don't get me wrong.  I just like the Yonge and Steeles location a little better for the upcoming reasons.

First the good things.  I find this Galleria has a lot more selection than the one at Yonge and Steeles.  There were products here that I don't see at that location.  It feels like this location is also larger and able to carry more items.  

The parking here is also tremendously better than the other location.  They have a humongous parking lot in the back of the plaza it is located in.  You don't think there would be this many spots looking in from the street.  This is great because this location shares the plaza with a lot of other places so you do need parking to be ample.  

Now, the things I don't like as much.  The food court was a little disappointing to me unfortunately.  The other location has 4 different stalls to choose from.  Each stall has different types of cuisine.  This place only has the one stall, albeit a really big one.  The seating is also not as good.  There are bar like seats situated around the stall which is great if you're eating alone.  If you come as a family, you have about 10-15 tables to choose from at that's it. I came for mama's chicken and quite frankly, you can do better for Korean fried chicken.  It's good, but didn't match the hype.  Home of Hot Taste blows it out of the water.

Lastly, this location is not open 24 hours.  I have stated the convenience of having a supermarket available at all times during the day.  Most of the Korean supermarkets I find are open 24 hours so it's strange not to see this one as well.  I'm thinking it's about the location more than anything.

To finish, you can't go wrong with either Galleria.  I myself just prefer one over the other.  You will have your opinion as well.  We can both agree though that Galleria rocks!"}
{"text":"This will be the first of two reviews for the two Galleria locations I go to.

Pros:
Open 24 hours
Food court built right inside

Cons:
Not many parking spots near entrance
Mainly Korean items

When I used to work evenings a lot, I loved coming here after a shift.  There's something about grocery shopping at 1 in the morning.  It's nice and quiet and you can go at your own pace.  Being open 24 hours, it's a very convenient thing to have.

The supermarket is very large and carries a good amount of selection.  It's mainly composed of Korean brand items which is no surprise.  If you're looking for Chinese and Japanese items you might need to look elsewhere.  The produce here is usually pretty good.  The prices are cheaper than the Metro's and the Loblaws type supermarkets in the city.  

There's a lot of prepared food here.  They're made fresh daily and can be bought for a quick meal for the busy individual.  They even have a section of freshly made Korean side dishes. These are the side dishes are like the ones everyone is familiar with when you eat at a Korean restaurant.

Another thing I like is they have a food court built right into the supermarket.  There's are 4-5 stalls that serve Korean and Japanese food.  I've eaten here a couple of times and they're all pretty good.  You will see families come here to have a meal and do their shopping all in one place.

One thing to note is the parking situation.  There's about 25 spots near the entrance.  Once those are filled, you probably need to drive around back to find more parking.  

It's nice to know that no matter the time, this place will always be open for your grocery needs.  They also have a point card which lets you collect rewards for shopping here.  It's always good to get something back for buying things usually need in the first place."}
{"text":"There is a hot bar that serves a variety of hot Korean food and a cold bar that serves a variety of cold Korean and western side dishes. You can grab a food tray and pile on whatever food you want to try. When we are at the store, each pound of food is 5.99 which is marked as sale from regular price 6.99 per pound. Other than the fact that fried chicken strip is cold, everything about the hot bar is great! There's beef bulgogi, braised pork belly, japchae korean glass noodle, fried rice, etc.

What a great place for a quick lunch! The food court is pretty full for a Monday lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! After spending several days in the city, it was great to find this place! It's in the suburbs, so no need to pay for parking (; 

I enjoyed the custard korean japanese crispy waffle but did not like the green bean one. On monday, they have $4.99 for one lb of their lunch buffet, I got an arrangement of things like seaweed salad, potato salad, sweet & sour pork, sweet & sour chicken, and the Japchae. I enjoyed the potato salad and japchae most. My boyfriend got the pork bone soup. It was fall off the bone good. It was delicious! I also ordered the 6 piece sashimi for only $6.48 and the tuna kimbob. I recommend it all!! 
Go try this place! Do not buy the groceries. Super expensive."}
{"text":"Food here is fresh, delicious and cheap. Even for someone as picky and indecisive as me, I always had no problem of finding something new to try. 

There's a bakery on the side in case you crave something sweet and small which is perfect for a light breakfast or afternoon tea!

The buffet station has all your Korean staple side + main dishes. You can easily create a perfect meal by adding a side of miso soup, (multigrain, brown or white) rice, or hot drink. 

There's also the option of ordering your ready to be made Korean or Chinese-Korean dishes like bibimbap, soon tofu, noodle in black bean sauce at the cash register. They give u this device that vibrates and flashes whenever your order is ready. 
Did I tell u they also have fresh sashimi and sushi to go?  So far I've tried the bone marrow soup, soon tofu, sashimi salad and create my own lunch box - everything tasted delicious! The best part? Averaging only about 7 dollars each meal! 

Don't forget to stop by the waffle station to pick up the some amazing Japanese Korean waffle fish! They were crunchy and piping hot - I haven't been able to leave without picking at least a box of 4 each time. I will definitely be back for my Korean fix on our annual Toronto visit."}
{"text":"Prior to this past weekend, I've only heard about this place, but never really had a chance to check it out as it's not in my 'hood.

In brief, it's like a Korean version of T&T/BTrust, more modern PAT.  Aside from the Korean-specific items Galleria carries, here are the other differences:  
-  produce looks fresher.  During both visits, they were being sprayed by the auto-sprinklers, unlike other grocery stores where produce is just stacked on top of each other in bins
-  there is no seating in the grocery store, but instead, there is a seating area after the checkout 
-  there is a food court + a bakery after the checkout
-  PSY's image is EVERYWHERE, even on the workers' t-shirts
-  according to their website, this particular location is open 24/7!!!

I wanted to pick up some banchans, but they were a bit more expensive than I thought.  There were a selection of them, pre-packaged, that you can mix 'n match for 3/$10.  You can probably get them individually weighed 'n priced (too mah-fan!), but I decided against it altogether 'cause 1 little package is like the equivalent of the cost of a bag of chips!  Maybe next time...when I'm having guests over/special dinner.  

Checkout was a breeze.  Kimbob that I purchased was a good snack and fresh.  Cooked items looked freshly packaged as well.  Bakery Gateau, the bakery beside the checkout, was yummy and reasonably priced.

Tip:  It's easier to enter if you're headed south on Yonge, otherwise, a bit of a nightmare.  And unless you like car accidents, there is parking beyond the entrance of Galleria.  Do not park in that \"laneway\" as it's really busy.  Exit behind the grocery store onto Steeles to avoid the congestion!"}
{"text":"Marked down sushi/meals at Galleria are the best!!!! The prices on cooked food go down between 30-50%. The korean side dishes are soo delish."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot! For some reason the Korean/Asian Presence is really taking over downtown. It's probably the instant noodles and tasty food options. 

I grew up on this stuff. Love it. Having it next door and affordable, even better. It closes late and has great staff. It's always clean and polite as well. It's a little smaller than most markets, but that's to be expected in downtown Toronto. The selection is unfortunately, respectively smaller as well. 

Basically, not much selection but has all the important stuff. Welcome to downtown. I hope you're here for a long long time."}
{"text":"Huge improvement from when I was last there.  It is really a tight-squeeze to get through the aisles and the customer traffic.  Lots of Adjumonis preparing mandu, ttoek and other delights to sample.  They have a ton of Korean snack foods and prepared food to go.  Their fish counter is good - they have prepackaged sashimi flown in from Korea which is very expen$ive.  Decided to break the budget today and bought of box of Korean pears from around the Gimhae area in the south.  Worth every penny, luscious, dripping with sweet juice ... ahhh ... 

Their meat counter also had the usual BBQ type meats, high-end and regular type cuts.

The store is surrounded inside by little restaurants (within the store) - we tried Hwan Ga Ne and Osaka Sushi which was OK.  The fish cake noodle was good - and of course splurged on the HOTTEOK cause I really 'need' a hotteok ... LOL.

What can I say.  I miss Korea and this is one of my go-to place when I can pick up my favourite items, see (and try) some new products on and partake of tteok or bean-paste stuffed dough shaped like a fish.  Don't shop when you're hungry, you'll buy everything ..."}
{"text":"Galleria has a good thing going on with its good customer service. The cashiers and floor staff are always very kind and willing to help. In addition, the selection of Korean food products is impressive and definitely showcases the newest products on the market. It also has a pretty sweet end of day sales (around 7:30pm) on kimbap, tteokbokki and other packaged foods. Galleria's foodcourt is probably one of my favourite things about this supermarket... the food is delicious!

I would go to Galleria more often however, one experience at this location has entirely changed the way I feel. I was stopped after paying for my groceries by the security guard who had a problem with my other bags that I brought in. I was carrying shoulder bags for my groceries. There was some stuff inside already from grocery shopping around the area (there is a No Frills across the street). He kept rambling on about how I shouldn't bring any bags in, and that if I wish to, I would have to leave them with the customer service desk at the entrance. He pointed out the policy that is printed on a laminate sheet. I found it really silly. I'm pretty sure their door censors would be able to detect if I stole something from their store. Then he said because I'm Korean that he'd let it pass and not confiscate my bags (hmmm so if I wasn't Korean, I guess I'm a criminal).

For Galleria Supermarket to place this sort of policy towards their customers is just bad business. While their floor staff are kind, this policy really tarnishes their customer service and branding."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's always has the best meats and veggies. Also it's open 24 hours so it's great for getting last minute items or just to grocery shop ! 
Definitely recommended to check this place out."}
{"text":"Open 24 hrs! Sweet! Love picking up the ready to eat dishes here and other random things. They also have household wares and gadgets. The produce are always fresh though they may not always have what I want. The prices are slightly higher than at T&T. 

The only bad thing about this place is the parking. Space is a little bit tight. As with all asian supermarket parking, my suggestion is to be alert at all times & back in or you will never be able to leave :)"}
{"text":"Very clean and orderly Korean supermarket. Highly recommend their Mama's fried chicken. On the pricier side at $21 for half a chicken but it is hands down the best fried chicken I've ever had. Oh so crispy and very little grease."}
{"text":"This place is clean and always have fresh food. Open very late. They have all the snacks and everything. Great for when you have the munchies"}
{"text":"Decent sized Korean supermarket, selling food and household items. Good fresh seafood and fresh pastries available. Prices are not bad.

There is also a food court that is quite good for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"What I like about this store:
-I love their selection of pre-made food; discounts on them after 7:30 pm everyday.
-They play classical or Korean music or sometimes they don't play music at all.
-They have a wide selection of fruits and vegetables that you can't get in other grocery stores.
-Generally, it's clean and easy to find stuff.
-Open 24/7 and they offer a delivery service.
-This shop is in a little mall of Korean goods (bakery, books, cosmetics, movies, drugs, clothes, fast food chains, etc.,), convenient for all your Korean needs, lol
-No charges on plastic bags. I sometimes forget to bring reusable bags.
-They sell really good high quality rice cookers.

What I dislike about this store:
-I've had one bad experience with their \"special price\" chicken breast. It looked fine wrapped but the moment I opened the wrapping, it was rotten. It had this foul, rotten egg smell that quickly filled my kitchen, and there was nothing I could do but to throw it out. Rather than putting it on \"special price\" and repackaging rotten chicken breast meat, they should have thrown it out. After this experience, I am very hesitant about buying meat from here. $5 wasted. 
-Their soft tofu also got rotten within a week. Unopened and stored in the fridge, soft tofu is usually good for at least a couple of weeks. $2 wasted.
-Pricey-and-not-much-of-selection items: cheese, milk, juice, chips, and bread; they must think you get these from other grocery stores. 
-Pricey items: Chinese sauces and condiments, Korean sauces and condiments, in general, Galleria is more pricey than other Korean grocery stores."}
{"text":"The supermarket is great! Clean & organized & packed with so much good food. They even have a good selection of pre-cooked meals to go. After the supermarket there is a bakery, supplements shop, video shop, travel agency & some small fast food places. It's like a mini mall, which is really convenient when the weather is cold & you don't want to go to a gazillion places to get everything. 

Tried a traditional pork bento with hubby that came with sushi as well. It was decent, but not spectacular. The bakery had some interesting pastries which were delightfully tasty. Though parking can be tricky. Just a note, there are two entrances to the complex. The second entrance closer to the Staples parking lot is usually more empty so try to park there instead of near the main entrance."}
{"text":"We go to the Galleria every Sunday.  I must admit that I love this place.  The produce and meat quality is exceptional and the prices are reasonable.  I particularly love to munch on the fresh fruit and mondoo (pot stickers) samples!  Korean food is not just for Koreans anymore!"}
{"text":"This is the best and largest Korean grocery store in Toronto hands-down.  I really love the free samples especially the fried dumplings!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here again for the Mom's Chicken. This time we got half and half which half fried and half coated in red chilli sauce. We waited approximately 30 minutes. I like the fact that they cook it in batch, it's cook to order. Popeyes and KFC does the opposite of Mom's Chicken. The cashier gives you a buzzer and it'll buzz when the order is ready. Good. I don't want to sit for 30 minutes waiting. 

While we were waiting for our order, my wife and I browsed around the supermarket. We found out that this place now carries beers. Since the LCBO around here closes at 10, come here to buy booze as this supermarket closes at midnight.

This place makes fish cakes - red bean, matcha and chocolate. We opted for red bean. The staff hands over two fish cakes and it tastes great!!!!!!!!!  The red bean just oozes when you take a bite. 

Finally the the buzzer buzzed.  Take a look at the pictures. 

There's no score for ambience. It's a supermarket for goodness sakes. 

We will definitely come back!  That fried chicken!!!

Food:  5/5
Service:  5/5
Cleanliness:  5/5"}
{"text":"Very good store! This place opened after their Steeles location but this location has a much larger ready to eat food department with AWESOME fried chicken! Yum. And great chicken katsu and sushi"}
{"text":"Love this supermarket for the hot food and bakery! The spicy crunchy fried chicken is a must try! The spice level is very low so don't worry about setting your mouth on fire. We got a combo box that has one half spicy crunchy and one half sweet and crunchy. I personally liked the spicy chicken more but each to his/her own. 

As for the black bean noodle, we ordered the larger size (#53) to share since we also got the fried chicken. To be completely honest, I have had better black bean noodle elsewhere. It didn't have as much sauce as I would have preferred and the noodles and sauce was slightly lacking in flavour. Overall, it was alright. Have to try the chicken though! 

We got some vegetables (bok choy, broccoli, cauliflower, and bell peppers) from the pre-made food bar. Price is by weight and it's $5.99/lb. A full box of vegetables was about 1lb. The cooked vegetables were a little oily but not bad. Got to get some fiber into the meal! :)

As for the supermarket itself, very clean, lots of different products you can purchase other than food. They have cosmetics, clothing, home care, rice cookers, kitchen utensils, and even kimchi refrigerators! A little something for your every need. Haven't actually done any grocery shopping here so can't comment in the affordability/quality in comparison with other supermarkets but will definitely do so in the future."}
{"text":"This place is heaven. The food is such good quality and very legit. Definitely my new favourite lunch spot. I would eat here all day every day if I could. Great prices too!"}
{"text":"Soooo EXCITED for this new Korean grocery store by my place! 

They generally have great prices, unique offerings that can't be found at many other grocery store chains and just happen to be on my way home from work!

If you are in the area, why not give it a shot? I know I will!"}
{"text":"Came here today to buy food at the food court and the supermarket.
Food court: ordered pork bone soup $8+ and moms fried chicken 1/2. 
Pork bone soup- 2 pcs of bones, 1 potato and no veggies. Broth is good but small serving. Plus 2 sides that you have to help yourself with (daikon and bean sprouts). 
Mom's fried chicken- crispy outside and juicy inside.. 1/2 size was $12 +. Would come back for the chicken. 
Supermarket: expensive than a regular Chinese store but they have everything korean and more. Bought perilla seeds powder for $7 +, perilla leaves $1.99 and spicy pepper flakes for $5 plus for my homemade pork bone soup. 

I will come back for the fried chicken and if i ran out of perilla powder only."}
{"text":"I normally love to shop in Galleria....the meat is more fresh then most of the supermarket chain in the city.  However this time, I bought a pack of cut up stewed beef and it was spoiled in 1 day.......Very disappointing.  This alone is a 1 star.  Usually I go to the Yonge/Steeles store but I guess this time I made a mistake!  

Other than that...

I am very happy to find all sorts of korean sauce, paste, oligo sugar, etc etc...this is a 4 star for sure so my final verdict is 2.5.  

One of my favourite items in the store is the Galleria brand sesame oil!! It was very fragrant."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!

I live around an hour and a half away from this place but I do sometimes decide to make the travel just to get some goodies from this supermarket. I love their prepared foods. They always have a variety of fresh foods and there's also a food court with different types of Korean foods to eat from. I did recommend my friends into coming here and they love it!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting for this place to open for months! I'm glad it finally did as I was in the area and I saw a massive balloon man infront of it with a sign saying \"NOW OPEN!\" Since this is downtown, this grocery store is an express store as it was small but they did fit a lot! The sections were all divided in different section which includes prepared foods, fruits, meats, candies, etc. The aisles were narrow and I measure that each aisle was abit longer than an arm's length wide. They just opened and so they have a promotion going on with certain items for sale. I will definitely come here to try the prepared foods during my work break. Service here is good and fast, as expected!

Outside, they had people spinning a wheel to win either a Korean snack, noodles or seaweed and it was free!!!"}
{"text":"Galleria is a large Korean supermarket that sells mostly Korean and Japanese groceries. It also houses a cafeteria, bakery, health product counter, and some boutiques. It's a great place to go for one-stop shopping.

The cafeteria is a bit hit and miss. Some good menu items like the pork bone soup (flavorful and tender pork), and then some outright terrible ones like the Korean traditional noodles (bland noodles in a bland kimchi broth). Service is generally good, though brusque at times. Solid experience, all in all. 

Wi-Fi is also hit and miss, but hey, it's free!"}
{"text":"Great service, best tasting food, and a clean environment... what's more to ask? if you do happen to pass by Galleria Express Supermarket, don't hesitate, go straight in, order anything (because everything tastes so good!), buy some groceries, and head on home feeling satisfied."}
{"text":"Open 24/7 - whaaattt?! I honestly didn't even know there were grocery stores that did this - besides Metro. They have a lot of unique ingredients and groceries (like Mentaiko - the purpose of my trip), a food court, prepared foods, a bakery, cosmetics store and household items."}
{"text":"This Galleria supermarket ( USA based ) is tidier and their stocks are well organized.  Martha Stewart will be so proud of it ! This market is cleaner  than T & T 
Go check out their \" ready to eat \" ; meat, vegetable & fruits sections ! They also have huge selections  of beers  ! yes beers  !!!"}
{"text":"I was not too impressed with the Galleria Supermarket Thornhill location but after visiting their York Mills location I am a FAN!! 

This place is not easy to find especially on a snowy evening.. There are no signage at all on York Mills.. the only reason I turning into this No Exit road because my GPS was telling me that it is on the left... 

I almost park and went inside Dragon Pearl Buffet... but I was amazed to see this huge parking lot around the corner where Galleria front door is!! 

Galleria as a Korean supermarket does have good selections of Korean and Japanese groceries and dry good. When walking around, I do have a sense that I am not in Toronto but somewhere in Seoul... since a lot of the Korean products has only Korean wording on the package.. looking at the design and picture of the package did make it a fun shopping experience. 

Love the Fresh Seafood department: half shelled oysters, cherrystone clams, squids, Norway salted Mackerel and even a whole Salmon head! The package sashimi graded raw fish is all nicely packed! (much much better quality than what they have at T&T!) 

Love the Cafeteria part and cooked food area: Fish cakes, packaged banchens, sushi and self served lunch box (don't load up your lunch box since it is based on weight!) and of course the made to order food. I could not resist to check out what the pretty Cashier (yes she was there and she was really nice but not my type!) and the kick ass Spicy Seafood Soup (yes it is spicy, made my tummy nice and warm spicy!) and the Corn Silk drink is nice and refreshing to balanced out the spiciness! Damn I drank the soup too! 

The Made to Order Korean Fried Chicken I ordered was not bad. Since they are double fried so extra crispy. But definitely not worth the wait of 30 minute! 

If you still hungry, there are free sampling of food everywhere! Nothing beats having a free sample of a few walnut cakes (3 of those I ate) as dessert to finish off my Korean adventure!

Or will I been in trouble if I park myself on the numerous bench and use their free wifi for hours while eating my packaged Sashimi next time?"}
{"text":"This is the brand new location of Galleria Supermarket in Thornhill replacing http://www.yelp.ca/biz/galleria-supermarket-thornhill which is up at 7171 Yonge Street!

After reading all these reviews about Galleria Supermarket, I was all excited and filled with anticipation when I walked through their sliding doors...

I am faced with a clean Korean supermarket.. just too clean.. too organized... 

Galleria has this wonderful banchan bars... those little crabs sure looks good to snack on while drinking a beer or 2...

Galleria Supermarket still a good place if you want to get some Korean groceries and try to make some Hot Spicy Soon Tofu with all these Hot Chili Powder... And the meat... just looking at those ribs makes me imagine how they tasted like on a Korean BBQ plate!

24/7 business hour is always A-OK for me!! :)

There are now 3 different food places for me to get my cheap Korean and Japanese food fix at the food court! Though they are not open 24/7 but close at 9 pm...."}
{"text":"Galleria is a regular on my shopping circuit for the simple fact that my fiancee is Korea, I mean straight out of Seoul Korean (not Compton). 

Everytime we go to Galleria my fiancee buys lots of meats, vegetables and sauces so I am assuming the market carries all of the Korean essentials. We are comparing it to the supermarket in the Koreatown downtown so it seems so big. We don't have experience going to the older one as we are new to Toronto. So on the Fiancee side BIG UPS.

Now for the picky white guys opinion which probably doesn't count for too much considering this place caters to the Korean pallet. I prefer the Kimchi at the supermarket downtown. I find the kimchi at Galleria to be too hot/spicy. Second the supermarket downtown in Christie carries a larger variety of Energy Drinks (also my favorite one from Japan) and Japanese snacks so I like to visit there. I only comment on this as me and my fiancee lived in Tokyo for 7 years so it is nice to be able to pick up a few of our favorite Japanese items while grabbing \"her\" Korean essentials. Yes that's right I said it, I did it, \"her\" Korean essentials. Just wish the Japanese stuff wasn't so overpriced!

Final Note - if you are new to Toronto and love Korean food, Galleria is definitely the place to go in the North York area."}
{"text":"A friend of mine introduced me to their kimchi and it was life changing. I ended up asking him to take me there as I had to have it at all times in my fridge. It turns out they make the kimchi there. 
Not only do they have great prices (I ended up getting food as well as face masks) but the service is amazing. Everyone there is like a kind aunt or uncle.
I ended up visiting the bakery section. Their cream cheese bun is amazing. I also purchased lunch there, the hand made pork and veggie dumplings. They were fresh and delicious. But the amazing part was when I asked for a left over box. The lady took it from me and packaged it so nicely. It didn't look like left overs any more lol. I highly recommend this place. It's so much more than just a supermarket."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area I MUST drop in for a red bean fish cake. For $1.25 how can I say no. Always tastes great and I'm never disappointed leaving here. It's always fresh, crispy and hot. The red bean filling is perfect not to sweet just the way I like it. The lady making it is super nice and welcoming as well. I've tried the fish cakes at the other Galleria at Yorkmills and Don mills and it's not as good."}
{"text":"What can i say? They serve sea urchin and other sashimi lunchbox for an affordable price.  my stomach hasnt been that happy for a while."}
{"text":"This location is not too far from highway which is continent to get to; however, the store is not as big as the one in Thornhill.  
They have a good selections of fresh meats in nice packages. Produce is just ok, could be fresher. 
There's a huge food court with tons of options for ready-to-eat  items. Lots of selections to pick from.
Their bakery is a little pricier but decent quality.  The potato matcha cake is delicous but pricy; worth a try."}
{"text":"Nice supermarket to pick up ethnic grocery, especially for hot pot. I like the original bakery as well; the green tea potatoe cake is one of my favourites and I haven't seen this cake sold anywhere else.
Although I like the grocery and bakery, I don't like coming here. It's always a nightmare, especially on weekend, with parking."}
{"text":"Mom's Chicken

Justine aka Foodigatorj highly recommended that I try Galleria Supermarket's Mom's Chicken which is only available at the Toronto Branch. I probably go there 2-3 times a month to stock up on Korean Noodles and Kimchi, so it was no brainer for us.

 A whole Chicken cost around $20 (also available in 1/2) and takes 30 minutes to make, so I'll recommend ordering it as soon as you get there and do your shopping while you wait.

We decided to eat it there as lunch and the 2 of us can barely finish the 1/2 Chicken.

You get to choose between regular and spicy.... we ordered spicy but it was very mild, the pieces are very huge which made it rather messy to eat. I would def bring it home to eat next time and would be perfect with a glass of beer or Makkoli (Korean rice wine).
 
You can actually watch how it's made at the open kitchen... it's coated with a seasoned flour and water mixture and deep fried for at least 15 minutes. Then it is toss very generously in a gochujang (Korean spicy red pepper paste)  mixture / sauce.

It came with a side of vinegar pickled radish (Korean version of slaw / celery stick) which was very cooling and refreshing after eating the sticky saucy chicken.

 Verdict :
 Crunchy, moist and recklessly sauced goodness 
~ I'll def be back for more but for take out this time.
~ Would have prefer if it was just chicken wings since the breast section was not as fatty (I do prefer dark meat)"}
{"text":"This place has the most selection of Korean products! Their produce is a bit expensive.  They're pre-made bentos and sushi are great and especially affordable when they go on sale in the evening!  Sometimes you can catch the guy at the corner making fresh taiyaki red bean cake.  They also have a food court with menu prices similar to sit in restaurants so I rather do that."}
{"text":"We got to this place by a beautiful coincidence and thanks to the GPS! 
We actually typed in Galleria market in the city but the GPS room took us here and I was kinda worried because we were driving quite far out of the city!
This was the best coincidence ever! Not only this place is a huge Korean market, it's basically everything Korea.My husband said I was in Korean heaven. Little did he know, I used to watch Korean dramas growing up and going crazy about going to Korea just to eat the authentic Korean food and this is the closest I could be going to Korea.
 Very clean and highly maintained store with a bunch and bunch of Korean items from food to clothing and skincare! The food court had so much food and I cannot stress enough how they much varieties they have. Food court also has a buffet which is priced per pound, I'm not very sure. 
We were full from the soup, toppoki and appetizers so didn't get to try Korean shaved ice and bakery's.
See you very soon, Galleria!"}
{"text":"In Toronto for the week for work, and finding this place across from the street from my hotel was a sign from god. Their cafeteria is amazing. Will probably eat here everyday this week."}
{"text":"The original and I guess, still the best K-SuperMarket.  You can find everything Korean here and some beers at the same time.
The fruits and veg freshness and quality is better than HMart.  Their prepared foods are good and there are alway more than a few samples to try.  Also, there are more food court vendors here than at the competitors.  Food at the court is expected...Meh....but it's cheap food.
I come here occasionally since HMart is so much closer but when I want some K-fresh stuff, it has to be GMart.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"So many options. Great place to rest and eat after grocery shopping. I went on a day thay the pork bone soup was yhe days special, it was only around 6. The thing they give you after your order will vibrate when food is ready, which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I love going grocery shopping here! It's clean, bright, they have a great selection of everything...like tofu? They make it fresh here along with soybean milk.  How about mushrooms? I specifically go here to pick up Ontario-grown shiitake and enoki. If you get hungry while shopping, no probs you can grab some food from their cooking station and eat it in their food court. I'm liking their kampppongi and KFC so far... will try more on my next visit.

oh yeah, tip I picked up from a friend... Get their free Galleria card and you'll get a 10% discount!"}
