{"text":"Finally made it in for breakfast, nice atmosphere, friendly and was a great meal. Quantity of food for price good deal. Had breakfast burrito, husband liked and I had ham and eggs.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Great lunch. Friendly staff. I have nothing but good things to say about the Dolphin. Never had a bad meal.   I've eaten here for years. Always consistently good. Lots of food for a good price.   Breakfast. Pancakes are so good! They have a vanilla malted taste. So good! Crepes are great! Omelets are huge. Skillets huge. French toast good! Honestly nothing bad. Bacon thick and hickory taste.   Lunch. Club sandwich a must. Salads are big and filling  and fresh. Burgers good too.   Not joking hometown little diner great food great price!"}
{"text":"This place is crowded so we ordered to go still got the great amount of quality food.  The applesauce was delicious so were the pierogies."}
{"text":"Was here recently as having attempted to eat at IHOP but never receiving food-son was in need of pancakes-so we checked it out.  Adorable inside, clean and fresh and lots of smiling staff.  Son was over the moon with pancakes, he said bigger and better then what we had just attempted to eat.  Will be back-wish they had longer hours though.  From time walking in door to walking we were fed and out in less then 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"I was sad when the Northfield location closed, but this is worth the 5 minute extra drive for me and the family.  They have the same great diner food that comes out fast and in an always shockingly large amount.  This location is smaller (more of a wait) but way more updated than the other location.  We will be moving our monthly Sunday breakfast to this spot."}
{"text":"This Dolphin's restaurant location has a very cold and mean feel to it versus their Northfield location. I couldn't wait to leave that place!!! At the cash register the \"cashier\" asked me if I was going to leave a tip and I tried to explain to that \"cashier\" my card automatically deducts a 15% gratuity at any restaurant, not fast food but waitress restaurants, AND as I wasn't thrilled to be patronizing this Dolphin's Oakwood location, I refused to tip TWICE right ONCE was a beating. She proceeds to say, \"Oh so the waitress gets ZERO tip right!!!\" Screaming to the rafters as I watched the 15% gratuity leave my checking account on my cell. I wanted to alert others about the poor food, the poor atmosphere and the all around rotten experience I endured, at my own expense, at this Dolphins location. I will NEVER go back. 10 million thumbs down"}
{"text":"I've always wondered about this place. Thought it was closed when I drove past all the time and one day we decided to head there during breakfast time and see. Man I'm glad we did!! This is a cute local place that has another location in Northfield. This is obviously run by family or friends-they are all so sweet and informal. I like that for a breakfast place. Definitely a lot of locals, especially during the weekdays-people are known by name.   The prices are very reasonable. And the portions are good, pancakes included with a lot of meals. (That's awesome) Feels like a friends house where mom is cooking breakfast. My friend LOVED the breakfast skillet. They recommended stuff really well! We've been back since and plan to go again-it's close to home  Not a fancy place by the way-so if you want a nice breakfast with cute dolphin and vacation decor this is the place for you, but it's not uppity so go somewhere else for that!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant with good, fast food. I have eaten breakfast here several times and wish them success. Good place to eat and chat."}
{"text":"This restaurant has very good food. The eggs and pancakes are the best in town. Normally crowded but worth the wait. If your looking for a delicious breakfast with the family or solo, this is the place."}
{"text":"Warm, friendly, fast and yummy!  We love this place for a small group or a large group. It has such a homey feel and the food is delicious. Try a scramble - veggie or Mexican for more food than you can eat and your choice of pancakes or toast as a side!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is closed no longer in business. Very sad I liked it decent food and great service"}
