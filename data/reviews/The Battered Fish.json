The cashier took my order quickly, even though there are 4+ people working the kitchen, it still took a long time to cook the food.
The fish is quite fresh and flaky, but the portion size is very small. Unfortunately the batter/crust is mushy and not crunchy at all. Probably because the batter disintegrated upon touch, the fish had very little flavor.

I got the fries fresh from the fryer, it was ok. But I would not get the fries on it's own.
The container is not very big, I would not recommend to the $2.50 upgrade to onion rings/other options.

There is a lot of  seafood in the seafood chowder, but other than that, it's not that tasty. It lacks either more cream or seasoning."}
{"text":"I have been a few times to this place, the last two times with a Groupon.  With the Groupon the value is good but at normal price this place is expensive for what you get.  

The Lobster Roll with a side of fries is $15 and was served on a hot dog bun basically (looked differerent than what was on the menu board).

The last time I was there is was around 6pm and they had sold out of fish peices!  All they had was \"fish tips\" left.

I sent them an e-mail about a serious health/safety issue and they didn't even respond.  

Personally I won't be rushing to go back."}
{"text":"Great to have options with your fish, we got the panko and beer-battered! Staff were friendly. They also have good sauce options!"}
{"text":"Juicy moist fish. Yum. Go for their signature sauce. Didn't like the fries but the sweet potatoe fries option looks good. A tad pricey but will return."}
{"text":"Ummm. We went back to Battered Fish on a hot summer Wednesday evening to try something new. 

We tried lobster roll and the regular favorite 3 fish fillet .

The order process was a bit slower and the cashier did not seem to be as customer focused. May be they are very busy...mind you, we had to clean our own table with vinegar and Napkin, so did the other table. 

The lobster roll tasted okay and the bread was nicely toasted. But for $15.99, it is a bit steep, especially for what happened to me when I substituted with sweet potato fries. 
What I did not understand was the lobster roll came with fries...when we switched it to sweet potato fries, they charged me $2.50 which is the same price as a regular side Oder. They did not give you any credit for the fries, like at Hero Burger. 

The fish was good..seemed a bit oilier than last time. The onion ring was okay too. 



There was a suggested order of halibut but they ran out. I ordered two sauces (wasabi and regular tartar) but we got 3, which meant that they were not paying attention :)

Overall, the food are still good. But I am not sure if I will get the lobster  roll or their side orders because I have to self clean, self serve and the service this time did not come with any enthusiasm"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick take away at about 11:30 on a weekday.  The place was not yet busy so everything was done immediately.

The lobster roll had a good amount of lobster in it.  The fries were decent but not spectacular.  The fish pieces were quite small and the batter (beer batter) was quite thin.  Onion rings were outstanding.  Nice and thick.

Lots of condiments (try the wasabi mayo) to go with your fish.  Friendly staff.

Will give it another go in the hope that it was an off day for the fish."}
{"text":"Was shopping on queen street west and finally decided to try this place.  Got the halibut panko crust, total for the meal came to 22 for two thin, dry pieces of fish... Fries were alright but will never come back here.  Go to the one that got away instead."}
{"text":"Just ate there today.  Better than average Fish and Chips.  They were out of Halibut (Darn !) so we settled for the Haddock with Beer Batter.  It was not too salty which is great.   Fish was cooked perfectly (eat while it's hot).  Also ordered scallops with seasoned bread crumbs..  Again, cooked just perfect.

I would give them a 5 but I don't like their Fries.  They are thin and stringy.  IMO the fries are a step up from MacDonald's fries.  Once they are cold, they are pretty chewy.

Other than that, better than average fish and chips place."}
{"text":"Filling! That was what came to mind when my sister & I were at this fish & chips joint, located conveniently near Spadina & Dundas. Though we shared a combo of some sort ($11) it was quite enough to satisfy us. We went on a Saturday morning so it was not as busy, and I must say their halibut was some of the best I've had in quite a while. Not sure if we'll be back, but we definitely enjoyed our experience here."}
{"text":"The food was great. We got haddock with the Panko breading as well as beer battered breading. The servers were so nice and accommodating and the atmosphere of the restaurant is fun and friendly! The fish was excellent and the French fries were perfectly hot and crispy. Would definitely recommend this place - very reasonable price for huge portions! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Yum, cheap and tasty.  My friend and I wanted poutine and found that this fast food joint has it.  The fish and chip is good, fish was very fresh and crispy.  If you are going to get poutine with other food, eat that first because it would get soggy if you wait on it.  We attacked that first because I have never had it before.  The gravy was so very tasty and the fries were crispy.  Such a great combination with the curds."}
{"text":"I walk past this place every day on my way to work, so I've been anxiously waiting for it to open. It did not disappoint! 

I ordered 2pc of beer battered fish with home cut fries and tartare dipping sauce (there are 5 sauces to choose from). I also ordered a side of gravy for my fries. 

The fish was great! Very crispy and flaky. It was slightly greasy, but it's fish & chips so I would be disappointed if it wasn't. The fries were good, but I would have preferred them to be crispier. 

Will definitely be coming back :)"}
{"text":"I had two great pieces of battered fish. The fries were awesome. My friend chose the salad instead of fries and he liked it too. Get the signature sauce, it's delicious. Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Since I started working downtown, the temptations of restaurants really get to me. Meeting up with an old university friend, we decided to try out The Battered Fish on Queen Street West, after finding a cheap Groupon online. Upon reading other reviews, there was something I had my eye on, the lobster roll. Since the Groupon was only good for $15 and the price one lobster roll was $15, we got separate Groupons.

We ventured into the restaurant around 2pm on a Thursday and it was fairly empty. A few people eating but not too packed. We ordered the lobster roll (As described on their menu: 100% Real lobster meat served our house made sauce served on a fresh New England style bun) and it came with a side of fries.

It didn't take too long to get our food and we couldn't wait to dig in. Although there were nice chunks of lobster, most of it was on the visible side of the bun. It looked like a lot of lobster but it wasn't as packed as it seemed. The lobster mixture actually made the bun really soggy to the point where the lobster wouldn't hold inside the bun. I wasn't a huge fan of the lobster mixture as it just felt lacking in taste. I would have probably went down the street to Fresh off the Boat for a lobster roll of better value. However, the fries were pretty good, nicely salted and not cooked to the point of dry fries.

I had way too much excitement and expectation for the lobster roll at The Battered Fish and it just didn't deliver. However, I may go back just to try the fish and chips before I can really judge this place."}
{"text":"Yelpers report this location has closed. Yet their own website  http://thebatteredfish.ca  shows it is still open, Strange indeed.
A few months ago I bought a Groupon coupon for The Battered Fish in Liberty Village.
I went there today and could not find the restaurant, walked around the block a few times, it's not there. But there is a place for rent, according to the photos on this site, that must have been it. Don't know what happened maybe the rent was too high.

Update: The Queen St. W. location honored the Groupon. They didn't have any halibut so I had haddock and chips. It was just ok. I was expecting better"}
{"text":"Beginning with one fish & chips shop in Halifax, Battered Fish has expanded to a total of eight locations, including our very own T-dot.  

It's in a convenient enough location on Queen Street West.  Within a reasonably walkable distance from the Finance District, filling a gap where previously you'd have to take a streetcar on King to get to an actual fish & chips-specialty place or pay a boatload (if you're feeling punny).

Battered Fish hits the mark for me in this regard: Starting at only $6 for a flat, hand-sized single piece of fish with a large scoop of fries on the side, I feel like it's a fair deal.  Choose your type of batter from original beer batter, crispy panko crust, breaded, or pan fried for a healthy option. 

I chose original beer batter for mine, while my friend had ordered two pieces: beer batter & panko crust.  The fish is a bit on the slim/flat side and I feel like the batter could be lighter but this one wasn't bad.  I was told that the panko crust was much better, especially with wasabi mayo on the side.

By the way, you can choose one sauce, which comes in one of those mini, clear plastic cups the size of a loonie.  Coincidentally, if you'd like more than one, it will cost you $1.

Battered Fish is a fast food joint where you order at the register, pay, then sit wherever there might be a free booth with plastic seating.  Utensils are dispensed via plastic homes that spit out one fork/knife/spoon at a time by pressing a lever on the side - seriously guys, those things are way more fun than it sounds.  Smart too, since it prevents from rummaging fingers and saves waste from individual cellophane packaging.  Press that lever.  Now press it again.  Awww, yissss. 

By the way, at the same utensils and condiments counter, you'll find several different types of vinegar and two different brands of malt vinegar.  Nice. 

No real service to speak of since it's fast food, but I did accidentally spill my fountain drink (~$2.65) and the cashier was quite nice about it. The lady at the register was also helpful in describing the batter types prior to ordering.  

When it boils down to it, I'd still have to champion \"that place\" in Leaside for the fluffiest and flakiest fish & chips, but Battered Fish is a decent pick for a weekday work lunch and I expect to come back soon.  You might CATCH (heh heh heh) me there - I'll be the girl pressing out 100 plastic forks."}
{"text":"Came here last week with the bf as we have been meaning to try this place.  We both decided to get a 2 piece meal with a side ($8 for the fish then another few dollars per side). However, they were out of haddock and only had halibut, so it was an extra $3 per piece. We didn't expect them to actually charge us the extra since they were out of literally the only other option but they did. We heard others arguing with the cashier about this as well, but whatever, we paid because we wanted to try it.  So it's already $28 just for the fish. We both got water, and he got fries while I got a Caesar salad. It ended up being $46, The fish was alright, I found it bland and my boyfriends was over cooked. The Caesar salad had zero dressing on it. The fries were good though. Overall, way too expensive for what you get, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon coupon for the Battered Fish. Ordered the large fish bit special and 3 tacos (chicken, shrimp, fish). The order came out to $21, but we had a $15 coupon so the final bill came out to $6. The fish bits were very oily and had an excessive amount of batter. The fried batter was brown rather than the golden colour you would normally expect which is probably caused by old oil or overfrying. In regards to the tacos, the chicken one was came as number one while I would rate the rest subpar. Honestly, the best part of the meal were the fries. They were fried well and had a nice texture to them."}
{"text":"I came here with a number of colleagues as we were all super excited to try out the new fish and chips spot! There was a little bit of a lineup but it moved pretty quickly. I like the fact that you can choose from a variety of batters to put on the fish. My favorite was the Panko battered version. 

I have to say I wasn't so impressed by the fries, as they definitely could've been crispier. Overall, it was just okay."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Great fish and chips, reasonable prices and quick service. Added bonus the fish coatings and made in store sauces"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and liked it both times. The first time I went, I ordered the fish and chips with the panko breading and the signature sauce. While it wasn't the best fish and chips I've ever had, I did really enjoy the panko batter and the sauce. The fries were really good and they give you A LOT of them. They also have a bunch of different vinegars, tons of hot sauces, and Frank's red hot sauce in a powder form that you can shake on your fries. The second time I went, I ordered the fish burger (again with the panko batter) and I must say that I enjoyed it a lot more than the fish and chips. The bun was soft and fresh and the signature sauce made it extra good. Definitely way better than a lot of the fish burgers I've tried elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Came with a Groupon to check it out

Pros:
Good portions 
Sauces were great tasting 

Cons:
The fish had a very oily taste to it
Very pricey for a fast food joint

Personally I wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Meh. Stopped in for lunch - they were sold out of lobster rolls and onion rings. So I got fish and chips. The combo was surprisingly pricey. The haddock was greasy and just okay. The sweet potato fries were greasy but delicious. That was probably the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"This is a new off shoot of Fish and Chips chain out of Nova Scotia. I do enjoy fish and chips once in a while and with friends in tow who actually are from Nova Scotia seemed like an appropriate place to visit. Right from the get go there seems to a haphazard approach to this place. There is only one cashier so the place which was busy for a weekend had a line up going. There were people waiting for seats though we did get lucky and got a spot. The alarming thing despite the lineup it felt like more people were behind the counter then in front of it. Not a good sign as order was messed up a few times (sides mainly) They didn't know if they had some side items in stock after taking the order and had to do a cumbersome refund. 
Ah well I hope they get their act together soon. On to the main event I am pleased to report the fish and chips are both decent. I tried the Beer battered version. Friends had the Panko crusted one and commented it being good. They do look like a fast food joint but the prices are not. All in all a decent place to get Fish and Chip fix. We were told they use seasonal fish so its either Cod or Haddock depending on the season. 
3.5 Stars."}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday evening. Place was pretty empty. They didn't turn on the AC (this ws in May at 25degrees). BOY WAS IT HOT AND HUMID. All the hot air and humidity from the kitchen just flowed out. It was pretty uncomfortable. 

Staff were okay. They didn't really pay attention. We had to wait to order our food as they were having a conversation. As we were the only people.. food came pretty fast.

Their battered fish was decent. Three choices and we got the beer batter and breaded. we couldnt rly tell the difference. They basically looked exactly the same except one had some herbs in it. Fish seemed frozen previously. The texture was dense.

The tacos were pretty good tho! We tried all three, fish, shrimp and chicken. They were filled with meat. Great for the price. They could do a bit better on the toppings within but not much complaint there. Great sauces on all three.i would recommend the tacos here, not the fish and chips."}
{"text":"A true taste of the East Coast. Got there about 1130 today, just before the rush. The customer service was very good, the cashier was friendly , the place very clean and because we beat the lunch hour rush there was not a long wait for the food and it was fresh and hot. 

Very limited seating and lack of garbage disposal for after you dine.

I had the Fish bites and Fries they were delish, my buddy had the lobster roll, was good except of 3 little pieces of shell. 
Even with that , we will be back 
Super good prices, along with a variety of menu items."}
{"text":"A tasty and fresh-tasting fast-food option via the Maritimes (specifically Halifax) for the downtown Toronto area. $10 will give you two pieces of fish prepared how you would like them, two sauces and a side of either home cut fries, onion rings, sweet potato fries, traditional poutine, house/caesar salad or cup of chowder. I would prefer to eat this kind of food in a pub setting but I can't complain about this fast-food option. Please, just go away Denny's and other whatever American fast-food chains. Hello and welcome, Battered Fish, Me Va Me Kitchen Express and the like!"}
{"text":"I came here today with a Groupon so I had a fantastic deal but even without the discount, I would say that the fish and chips here are set at a fair price for pretty awesome portions. 

I ordered 3pc fish (one of each kind - beer battered, breaded, and panko crusted) with fries which totaled to $15.80. Maybe it's because fish n chips are oily by nature and I couldn't see myself tanking all three pieces with fries in one sitting, but this order basically lasted me two meals! 
I loved that they gave me one sauce per piece of fish because it allowed me to try 3 of their flavours. I highly recommend the wasabi mayo, which I found to be the best one. The tartar sauce and signature sauce were both a little bland.
As for the fish, my ranking from highest to lowest would be beer battered, panko crust, and then breaded. Beer battered was the best in my opinion because it was lightly fried and was a crisp but thin layer. The other two were too crunchy and thick layered. The fries looked a lot crunchier than they actually were (which is a good thing), and although I ate all of them, I felt that they were a bit too oily.

With the Groupon deal, I would definitely come back. Service was great and presentation of the meal was on point."}
{"text":"I am basing this review primarily on the very poor customer service we received. We stood in line with no one else behind us or in-front of us for about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged by the cashier.  She continued to call orders (well shout orders) without taking a moment to say hello or I will be with you in a minute. Even the cook felt uncomfortable and told us a few times that she will be with us in a minute! Seriously, its not even his job! 
On the food, it was meh for the price I paid - the fries were burnt and the fish wasn't that good. Never again."}
{"text":"I got about 4 fish tacos. They were all delicious. The wait was a bit excessive, but it ended up being worth it. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Lean in, friends, because it's about to get biblical in this review. I will tell you that this is just the second time I've been here. We ordered the maritime poutine, the fish sandwich and one each of the tacos: Fish, spicy chicken and shrimp. 

The maritime poutine was good, as always. It's just a regular poutine with pieces of the fried fish, but it is so amazing. They definitely don't skimp on the gravy and the cheese. We also tried the fish sandwich with signature sauce and the fish taco, but it seemed like a bit too much fish at thending lthough it was all cooked really well.

But while those are all excellent things, I am really here to talk about the shrimp tacos. Because really, I think they should rename the battered fish to EAT ALL THE SHRIMP but it's not as catchy.

We ordered the first shrimp taco and ordered a second. And when we unwrapped it, and the soft shell unraveled (soft shell better than hard shell always) my boyfriend and I were in awe. Not 2, not 3, but 4 glistening, crispy fried shrimp in  golden batter nestled on a bed of lettuce, diced tomatoes and sauce. Looking down at it, I felt like Mary looking down on the face of baby Jesus. Even the lights in the restaurant were brighter. And my God, that first bite of crispy, juicy shrimp makes me salivate just thinking of it. I felt the touch of God in that restaurant. When they say made to order, they don't disappoint. This isn't some greasy restaurant shrimp trapped in a pan for eternity, this is just taken out of the deep fryer shrimp. Such a steal, 3 tacos for $9. Go forth, and wonder 

Do I have a picture to show you? Of course not, because of course we shoved it in our mouths Pronto. But like an early follower of of Jesus, you're just going to have to believe me when I say it was absolutely glorious. Peace."}
{"text":"Deducting two stars on a repeat visit. I ordered clam chowder and the container was only half full. I took it outside the store already so it was too late. You better double check your chowder if you order it. $6 for a few gulps of clam chowder doesn't sit right with me."}
{"text":"My craving for Crisp and golden brown Fish 'n' Chips brought me here and I wasn't disappointed. 
Typical fast food style atmosphere. Wasn't crowded at all when we arrived, it was a Sunday late evening, so that wasn't a surprise. The place has 4 comfortable booths  and the a few other fast food restaurant style seating arrangements. 

We ordered a 3pc platter of fish n chips with a side of Newfie fries instead of regular fries. I requested if I could try each of the batters in one order: beer batter, Pablo crusted and tempura. They happily obliged. I had never tried Newfie fries and was excited to find them on their menus. So ofcourse, I ordered that on the side. 

All three batter styles were delicious. Me and my wife had our own favourites. I loved the beer batter one: it was crisp, golden, swollen at the right places and moist from inside. My wife loved the Panko crusted version. You get a choice of three dips out of : signature, wasabi mayo, tartare, siracha mayo and i think there was a curry dip. We went or signature, tartare and wasabi mayo. We enjoyed the tartare sauce the most, but I can imagine people enjoying the other two just as much. 
The common condiments section gives you access to ketchup (if you wish to abuse the fish n chips), mustard (if you are really missing your hot dogs), malt vinegar ( if you're British and missing home), siracha ( if you're just addicted to the damn thing like me) and regular vinegar if I remember correctly.
The place also offers some burgers and sandwich rolls with shrimp etc. I was hoping to get some lobster bites, but they don't have them on the menu. But that was perfectly fine. 
All in all great casual dining experience, quality seafood and friendly staff. Highly recommend it. Close to TTC and great view of CN tower as you walk towards the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is worth waiting for!  The panko coated fish was delicious - just enough crunchy coating and the fish was perfectly cooked. Buffalo fish bites - HOT and once again well prepared. Fish taco - 3 good sized pieces of fish. My only complaint was that the \"taco\" wrap was too flimsy. Should be either a corn wrapper or crisp it up to make it more sturdy. Other than that, this place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"We've had one dish here so far and really liked it! It's a neat concept, you choose your type of batter, how many pieces you want and your side, so it's wonderfully flexible. We had the beer battered fish, which came out light and really crunchy, without having too much grease. The cod was delicate, moist and most tasty. Fries were crunchy, and separated from the fish to keep things fresh. A wonderful first experience."}
{"text":"The fish was actually \"meh\"-- but THOSE SHRIMP TACOS ARE EVERYTHING.

Fries were good, too.  But I'm still talkin' 'bout those shrimp tacos.  And it's at the end of my street.

So, booyah."}
{"text":"Visited with the Groupon deal ($8 for $15) and got 3 pieces with fries and only paid extra 80 cents to cover taxes. This turned out to be an amazing deal.

The fish were quite fresh and the batter is not overpowering. They were very flexible and allowed the pieces to be coated with their 3 different kind of batter: original breaded, beer batter, Japanese panko crust.

The most flavourful batter was the Japanese panko crust that had a good balance of saltiness and mild spices, which was my personal favourite. However one may find this batter too overpowering. The original breaded is quite standard while beer batter provides a light and crisp taste.

Also, get the signature sauce as it's quite good. It taste like a tarter based sauce with a hint of spicy mayo.

Overall, this is a fantastic Groupon deal that I would highly recommend. It's little pricey without the Groupon but still reasonable if you are craving some fish and chips."}
{"text":"Not bad at all but I did get sick the night of so im not too sure...

Food: 3/5, we got the family special with 6 pieces of haddock, large order of fries and coleslaw.  The fish was tasty and oily. The fries were delicious but very salty (probably why it was so good). The coleslaw was relatively left alone.  It also came with tartar sauce, some aioli and gravy.

Service: 2/5, not much as you just order and pick it up yourself (fast food style)

Ambience: 3/5, large area seating and food court style.

Price: 3/5, about $30 for two people getting the family pack. Not bad for all that food.  

It tasted good and I would recommend the place since I don't know whether something else got me sick (maybe the coleslaw)"}
{"text":"Ordered the beer battered fish and chips, and was expecting the fish to be more substantial.  The fish itself was cooked relatively well, moist and flaky, albeit a bit too much batter for my taste.  The \"chips\" were pretty bad - soggy, flavourless with burnt pieces.  If this was any other place, I would give it 3 stars, but because they specialize in fish and chips, I knocked off another star."}
{"text":"Fish and chips were excellent.  The flavored mayos are a nice touch.  Loved the wasabi mayo. Service was very friendly.  Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Lobster Grilled Cheese Sammy? This is not your regular Fish and Chips shop!  Driving along Queen Street, I saw the bright yellow sign and fought for a parking spot 3 blocks away.  I was expecting just a good fish and chips lunch, but this place is considerably different.  First, there was a line up after the main lunch hour.  And they have an app!  I didn't bother to download it, but next time I will just to be able to order online and pick it up quicker.

Second, my meal choice was not a clear decision. They have Lobster Rolls, Scallops and Fries, Halifax Donair Poutine, Newfie Fries and more. That is the meal on my next visit.

I decided to try my old reliable reference point--Fish & Chips.  I ordered one piece, chose panko as my coating, and instead of chips I upped it to a cup of thick, rich and meaty chowder.  My lunch guest had similar, but we shared the 3 for $9 Shrimp Tacos as an appy.  The 3 jumbo shrimp per taco were some of the most perfectly fresh and perfectly cooked shrimp I have ever enjoyed!

Oh, the fish?  Also extremely good, in fact the best I have had at any restaurant outside of the UK.  The tartar sauce tastes really scratch made-not a bottled concoction.  There are several other fresh made dips, like Wasabi Mayo that they are happy to let you try at no extra charge.

The Battered Fish appears to be a Haligonian staple, with 7 locations around Halifax, and this lonely little location in Toronto.  I can assure you of one thing:  there will be more locations in the GTA if it means I need to buy a franchise myself!

By the way, the 3 block walk back to the car was needed..."}
{"text":"This place definately needs some air ventilation!!! It was a hot and sunny Sunday evening, they didn't have the A/C on or any kinda of ventilation. As you as you walk in, you feel the stuffiness, the fried smell from the kitchen. It was just a big turn off. They didn't have any windows to even open up, which was quite weird since they are located at the corner, so plenty of glass but zero windows.

Menu is pretty small, not much to choose from. We ordered 2 pieces of haddock with 2 different types of batter, one was breaded and other was beer. Also ordered all their tacos, fish, chicken and shrimp.  The haddock doesn't come with any sides and if you want, you have to pay extra for them. There was basically no difference between the 2 batters, it tasted exactly the same. The fish were obviously frozen fish because of the texture and the frozen smell you have in foods when they're in the freezer too long. It was quite disappointing since I heard they were known for their fish and chips.

The tacos on the other hand were way better compared to the haddock. The shrimp was deep fried with 3 pieces in the taco along with some house made sauce and lettuce. The fish was just a stick of deep fried haddock with house made sauce. Chicken was also deep fried with some spicy house made sauce. There's more condiments like hot sauce, vinegar on the table if you would like to add it to your food.

Overall, I wouldn't come back, only the tacos were considered alright, the rest were disappointing. The whole time I couldn't relax and enjoy the food because the more I ate, the hotter and stuffier it got, making me wanting to leave faster."}
{"text":"The fish was hard and almost impossible to chew on. My friends said that their fish was better, so maybe I was unlucky?"}
{"text":"After a long day exploring Toronto, my wife and I entered Battered Fish on Queen with great hopes.  What we found was great, friendly service and food that was cooked to order.  We sampled the fried fish and the scallops.  Both were fried in a light beer batter.  Our meal was accompanied by our choice of really delicious homemade sauces.  The mound of fries accompanying the meal will please the hungriest eater.  This place is so satisfying and a huge leap above fast food.  Did I mention the lovely service?"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place for a while but kept procrastinating. Today I finally had a chance. First off, there was a bunch of stuff not available, drinks, food, and their only desert. I got 3 pieces of haddock and sweet potato fries. I also got three complimentary sauces. This cost me almost $20 dollars. Yes you heard right, $20. I think my total was 18.32 or something. The fish was alright I tried all three types of breading a and the panko one stood out as the best. The seasoning wasn't really there. The sweet potato fries were decent. My issue is that I paid $5.50 for sweet potato fries and got maybe 15-20. That is asinine. The sauce containers were tiny. The food here is not much to go out of your way for and the prices are laughable in comparison to what you receive. I would say skip it, it's not worth the effort."}
{"text":"Oh man, if I could sum up this place in one phrase, it would be \"drenched in oil\".  We ordered tacos and a large fish tips special.  The tacos were pretty good, especially the chicken one.  I was however very disappointed with the fish tips.  Many of the pieces were just layered in batter and oil, that I didn't really taste much fish.  

One of the pros of this place is certainly the location, but it took me a number of napkins to dab off the extra oil."}
{"text":"I don't like writing negative reviews unless I've been somewhere enough times to confirm the negativity but seriously... after coming here once, I really don't see myself coming back in the future.

There is nothing inherently awful or bad about this place--it's clean and convenient and the food gets to your hands super fast. Looks like a nice one-restaurant food court, with the shiny tile floors and impressive supply of condiments (3 different kinds of salt! 3 kinds of vinegar! ketchup! pepper!).

BUT: the food. just. did they think that if they left 3 kinds of salt out on the counter, they could skip putting it in the food? Now I'm generally fine with minimal salt if the food itself inherently has some sort of flavour that you wouldn't want to mask with the salt, but the problem here is that the food is bland bland bland. there was barely any taste to the fish--although the panko crisp was satisfyingly crunchy (see, I try to be positive). The fries were soggy, squishy, and flavourless.

maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I played it safe and ordered the fish and chips, and shouldn't the main advertised meal of the place at least be passable? what a shame."}
{"text":"Got the beer battered and Japanese Panko batter fish and it was good. Nothing special but their seafood clam chowder was amazing. One of the best ones I've had so far. There's actual seafood inside (scallops, shrimp, fish). They didn't cheap out on the ingredients. It's creamy and rich. I'm definitely coming back for their clam chowder."}
{"text":"This place was okay. My boyfriend and I went here a while ago. The fish and chips I order was battered so thickly that I hardly got much fish. And My bf's Chicken Sandwich was hard as hell and tasted like fish. Evidence that their grills need to be cleaned thoroughly."}
{"text":"It's...edible, but the answer to, \"How can you screw up fish & chips?\" = NO SEASONING, bland.  Neither batter nor fish had any salt in it.

Presentation?  Think if McD's was a fish & chips place.  I ordered 3 tacos (2 fish, 1 shrimp - $9) and they were wrapped up like...wraps.  Wraps were flour tortillas a la package.  Some price points aren't bad, re:  tacos, but there were slightly pricier things on the menu, re:  ~$14-15.  So I'd suggest you try the lower priced stuff first.

Fries weren't drained long enough, so they weren't all that crispy and a bit greasy.  The crispy thing really stands out though 'cause I don't like my fries limp.

Interior sorta reminds me of a nice McD's as well.  There was some kinda leak in the washroom that should be addressed.

I personally would not recommend, especially with a ton of other affordable options in the immediate area!"}
{"text":"Got take out here. Wasn't really too impressed with the food here. 

Ordered beer battered haddock with fries. The fish and fries were too greasy;I know, it's deep fried, I should expect greasy food. But the fish I got, when I picked it up with my fork the oil was dripping off of it and there was a pool of grease at the bottom of my box. The fries were thin cut, they weren't crispy, just sort of... Mushy. As for the tartar sauce and other sauces, I wasn't really happy with the amount of sauce they gave, it was like... Less than the amount of ketchup I could get in those little paper cups. 

I'm hoping I just came on an off day, cause so many people hyped up this place so much. So maybe I'll give it another try later on and see if they can redeem themselves."}
{"text":"The Battered Fish is a brand new spot next to Aroma and Williams Landing in LV.  The interior deco matches their branding: yellow and black.  Seating is scarce with six stools by the window and 3-4 person booth in the corner. It feels like a quick bite or take and go style restaurant. I ordered 3 tacos and a lobster roll with fries. Took about 10 mins and $27 to get my order. Everything needed more sauce."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the many other reviewers that the fish is a little bland/under seasoned.   But overall I thought my meal was excellent.   Very fresh.   Very crispy batter.   Good shoestring French fries.   1 piece of beer battered fish with fries for $7 is priced right.   Not enough seating at lunch, not even close."}
{"text":"The Battered Fish opened a new location last week in Liberty Village ... I walked there for lunch today.

It's a small place ... there's just one table and six hightop chairs along the window, which is where I sat.  When I got there, one of the employees was using the table to do some bookkeeping/reconciliation.

You have a choice of fish (I had haddock), the amount of pieces (I had two), the kind of batter/breading (I had the light beer batter) and sides (I had fries).

The fish was good ... it wasn't too greasy and the batter was light.

If you are so inclined, you can buy lobster-flavouried chips.  Gord had tried some a couple weeks ago at an east coast comedy night ... he said they tasted like BBQ-flavoured chips with an off-putting fishy aftertaste."}
{"text":"I liked this place solely for the beer battered fish. Everything else was tolerable at best. 

For a fast-casual restaurant, the service is pretty slow as the employees don't work with urgency. There was two groups in front of me to order and it was quite a wait before I could even order. Then it took a while before I got my food. While I don't mind waiting if the food is great, its just infuriating when the kitchen staff are just chatting or being idle. I wish it wasn't an open kitchen for that reason. 

The fish itself was pretty good. Very crispy and the fish was flaky and juicy. The fish itself almost made me forget the long wait. The tarter sauce that it comes with is delicious as well, but they only give you a small ketchup container worth. The sign says 25 cents per sauce, but I guess the first tarter sauce is free. If it wasn't for the long wait, I would've ordered more. 

The fries were pretty good, but when i eat fish and chips I envision chunky fries. At least something that isn't like shoestring mcdonald fries. 

Overall there is fairly decent seating, two big booths, four tables of two, and a few window/bar seats. However, at lunch time, many of the tables were occupied by solo diners. 

The fish definitely overshadowed the rest of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Last week I was out running an errand for work.. I realized I must have got a whiff of the near by Battered Fish because I suddenly had a serious hunger for Fish and Chips. It isn't something I find myself in the mood for nowadays but couldn't shake the thought of it after I found myself wanting it. I stopped by after work.
I grew up in the Maritime provinces and fish and chips were my chicken fingers and fries for years. Now to each their own, but when I crave fish and chips my taste buds have specific expectations for the fish..
Has to be beer battered, has to have good ratio of batter to fish, and good crunch and flavour... With ketchup. I had tried a piece of fish from an extremely popular joint around here when my housemate had gotten fish and chips and I was really disappointed. For that reason I was a bit hesitant to order a 3 piece since I hadn't tried the fish here before.. but I went for it. I even got take out and walked all the way home before eating it. Amazingly enough it was NOT soggy, phewf. Could have been luck. Anyway, it was delicious and I was really pleased with the taste of the fish. My taste buds weren't let down, which is the most important part.

The girl at the counter was so friendly and nice. She ensured I had plenty of ketchup as I told her I don't have it at home. I have recommended my housemate to come here for proper fish and chips. I am happy to know I can come here if I need good beer battered fish in the future :)"}
{"text":"The fish seemed to be completely unseasoned... some salt would go a long way. The poutine was pretty decent."}
{"text":"The menu is overly wordy, which makes it hard to read but the staff is friendly. I tried each of the batters and couldn't really notice the difference between them but then again, I'm not a big fish and chips expert. The fish was moist and the batter was light. You get a sauce for each fish and they compliment the fish and chips nicely."}
{"text":"They have the right idea, but it just doesn't cut it. I like when a specially type restaurant acts like one, this has a temp pop location all over it. Mind you some of the pop ideals are great here like the branding. All in all the experience is mixed one with no clear indication on table service, what there's always some fish out of stock, plastic cutlery and more. 

All of that aside, the food was just ok. Great options for batter and sauces but the fish just was tasty."}
{"text":"Went for an early lunch (11:15am); so the place was empty. Very clean. Modern, hip fast-food joint that is built for take-out: not many tables, but a large waiting area as all dishes are made to order.

I had a voucher; so I ordered 3 pieces of haddock, fries, and a fountain pop. I got 3 different preparations of fish: tempura, beer-battered, and regular-breaded. They came with choice of 3 mayo-based sauces: I got sriracha, wasabi, and traditional tartar sauce.

The large portion of fish was fresh and perfectly cooked: crispy on the outside, hot and flaky on the inside, just the right amount of grease. However, as other reviewers have noted, the fish and all coatings were rather bland. You really needed to slather the fish with sauce to get some flavour. If you are more of a salt and malt vinegar purist, you may be disappointed. Maybe this is in keeping with regional traditions, but in a contemporary, upscale place I expect more aggressive seasoning. A lemon wedge would also have been very welcome. My favourite combination was the breaded fish with sriracha mayo.

On the other hand, the fries were flawless: fresh-cut, shoestring, perfectly cooked. Delicious. I will come back just to try them in a poutine.

Overall, I was pretty happy with the meal, but it was a bit pricey for fast food."}
{"text":"I wrote a review of this place a couple months ago.

I was very complimentary of their halibut fish & chips as well as their haddock.

In fact, I ended my review with the comment \"I would give the halibut in beer batter with signature sauce a full 5 stars. But given that half the time I go, they've run out of halibut, I took away a star.\"

I'm now taking away three stars! I took away one star last time because HALF the time I went, they were out of halibut. The thick halibut filets, perfectly deep fried and dipped in their signature sauce set a new standard for fish & chips in my opinion. But for the last two months, they NEVER have halibut anymore. (Deducting a second star for this.) Worse yet, one of the staff gave the lamest excuse. (Deducting a third star for this.) She said halibut's gotten too expensive. OK... but when gas prices go up, gas stations don't stop selling gas. When house prices go up, real estate agents don't stop selling houses. When beef prices go up, The Keg doesn't stop selling steaks.

I believe these folks opened a second Toronto location in Liberty Village late last year and it flopped within a few months. Well gee, when you stop offering your signature dish, maybe people stop coming. Raise the prices if you need to. Or cut the halibut into smaller portions per order. But don't stop offering it altogether!

And so I've been settling for their haddock fish & chips. But something's changed over the last few months. I don't know if it's one of the ingredients in the batter... or they use a different oil... or they've changed the temperature settings of the deep fryer, but the fish & chips come out looking darker, and feeling greasier than before.

It's a shame really... this fast became my go-to fish & chip place downtown the first few months they were open. Not anymore :-("}
{"text":"im always on the look out, for the latest and greatest seafood establishment, going to halifax was one of the greatest trips of my life. i heard about this business through a contractor at work, who actually helped do the plumbing for this restaurant, so patiently i waited and waited and waited till it was open. upon it opening i told my significant other about the place and planned a \"date\" to go in. before even stepping into the restaurant, i wanted to see what was on the menu, i was a bit taken back by the prices not being \"open and available\" on the website. seeing where this is in the \"downtown\" core i was a little worried that the pricing was going to be above and beyond. 

enter date night
very, very easy to restaurant to get to via transit and minimal walking from the \"subway u bend\" very clean(brand new, goes without saying, but has to be said) very open, and very bright. there is a few stools, where people can eat and watch passerby's on queen st, with other tabled seating and booth seating towards the back of the restaurant, we went up to order, we were greeted by very VERY friendly staff, which was not only warm and welcoming, but not very common for this area of Toronto. after seeing the menu online, i knew what i wanted and placed my order. the bill was a tad bit on the steep side *up-front* we were told that due to the size of the order, and how everything works, it would be about a ten minute wait to cook the food, as they cook the food made to order.

the waiting went by pretty quick as we were entertained by a t.v. at our booth, not that there is a TV at every booth, we picked the booth with the t.v.
the food got to the table and the smells that hit your nose was not over-bearing but a gentle seafood scent, which is nice if your turned off by the harder fish scents. 

the seafood was great, very fresh and complimented well with sauces and seasonings i was completely happy with everything that was seafood related. my S/O had an issue with the batter overpowering the actual fish and fish flavors. the only dessert menu option was very very good, pretty happy with choosing that, would like to see more dessert options in the future. 

a couple of weird points, the fries are unseasoned, and thin like McDonald's fries, throw some salt of it, any sauce that they give you, that is free, is literally less then a shot worth of sauce, and lastly, the \"white sauce\" on the don-air poutine doesn't compliment the meat or the poutine, i would recommend the poutine without it...if it is an option. 

i cant stress this enough, the staff is super friendly and warm, the seafood is great and balanced, and everything is super clean. 

as others have said, i would come back: for the seafood only"}
