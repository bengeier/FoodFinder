{"text":"I have only been here for drinks. It's a typical dive bar that allows smoking and has a lot of regular customers. The prices are crazy cheap! $2.75 for a shot of fireball? Yes please."}
{"text":"A friendly little neighborhood place where everybody knows your name. The Wednesday wing night is the best in the area, and the famous \"asshole sauce\" will definitely get your attention. The dollar tacos on Friday nights are a great value. The annual Wild Game Feast is legendary among local hunters and sportsmen, and takes place two weeks after the Super Bowl. Bob's is a favorite hangout for local law enforcement officials, firemen, civil servants, and neighbors. I always stop in when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! The food is disgusting, the patrons are ridiculous. And the owner and bartender are racist! Stay away! These moronic gun toting bar goers belong in the deep south, not east Pittsburgh. Additionally, the beer is reasonably priced."}
