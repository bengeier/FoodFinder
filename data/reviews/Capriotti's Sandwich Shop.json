{"text":"Would highly suggest to try this place awesome sandwiches"}
{"text":"I think its GREAT, with a capital G. First discovered them when I was in Nevada. I'm a vegetarian so was expecting the typical veggie sub. Boy was I pleasently surprised. They have four different veggie selections including a veggie turkey sub., veggie cheesesteak, and veggie burger. I've only had the veggie turkey and veggie cheesesteak.  The cheesesteak was just O.K. and I wouldn't get that again, but the turkey was fantastic.  

The negatives is that they can be slow at times, and prices are a bit high, but I can live with that.  Definitely one of my favorite sub shops."}
{"text":"I don't see what the big hype is about this place I went here one time n got the chicken cheesesteak I didn't like it. Then my co workers told me I had to get the one they are know for which is the bobi I guess. N I tried it. It was still not good. N in top off it was a chopped up turkey bone in my sandwhich which scratched my throat n I almost choked on n died. N the staff wasn't nice when I walked in there was no one in line it took him 3 minutes to even look up from the grill n notice I was there."}
{"text":"Growing up when i was left at home with my dad he would always take me to the capriottis sandwich shop. My favorite sandwich to get was the tuna sandwich with lettuce tomatoes and onions with light mayo and pepper no cheese. This cappriottis brings back these memories and the service never ceases to amaze me.

the staff is quick and friendly. the cashier saw that everyone was doing well and was given the personal treatment he or she deserved. How else do i describe such a wonderful atmosphere. It gets better for me because it is an easy walk from my school when i finish."}
{"text":"So, a friend told me I should try the Veggie Bobbie, and I did.  It was like having Thanksgiving Dinner in March!  It was tasty, big, filling and fabulous.  If you are a veggie lover, just try this!"}
{"text":"Getting a \"Bobbie\" is how we start our Vegas visit each and every time. Its Thanksgiving on the go!"}
{"text":"They didn't have the meat for the sandwich I ordered. So I ordered another sandwich, which was cheaper and they didn't refund me the difference. Both my mom's sandwich and mine was dry and the bread stale. Oh yeah, and I found many small bones in my sandwich as well. DO NOT RECOMMEND. WIll NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Always great sandwiches and service no matter what time of day or evening.No matter which sandwich you choose, it is made fresh to order as you watch."}
{"text":"Well, wouldn't you know, I just wrote a review and now I get to enjoy one!  Delicious, peppery/sweet, but not too sweet slaw.  Flavorful thinly sliced pastrami, just enough cheese and russian dressing.  I'm in heaven."}
{"text":"There's finally a Capriottis shop close to our home. No more driving for 10 minutes for our Bobbi fix.
Always fresh and made to order. Great to know they're here at Discovery park in Aliante."}
{"text":"My coworkers kept on raving about this place so I had to go check it out. Maybe my tastes are just different, but I was not all that impressed. Apparently the place has won awards for it's Thanksgiving themed turkey sandwich, which I got, but I found the sandwich to be passable - nothing spectacular. 

Food was decent, service was so-so, and I think everything was a tad overpriced.

I mean if you're tired of the normal chains like Subway, Quizno's, etc... going to a \"mom and pop\" shop like this one may break the monotony, but this one is actually a chain too..."}
{"text":"If you come to Vegas you MUST COME HERE. Lemme tell you rite now, this place is SUBWAY ON CRACK.

You can't go wrong with Italian or Turkey, since they're pretty standard for subs. I don't know why, but they taste so much better than subway. One thing I do know is that unlike subway or quiznos, they give you lots of meat instead of packing it with tons of lettuce! I've tried the Bobbie, and it's like a Thanksgiving meal packed into a sandwich. It's a hate it- or - love it kinda deal. It wasn't bad, but I'll stick with the Italian.

Also, for $13 you get TWENTY INCHES. Yea, 20 inches.

I ain't never goin back to subways after this."}
{"text":"Not really into sandwich places but I was in Santa Fe Station and hungry so I followed a friend's advice and tried it. Out of all the food choices in there it did seem the most interesting one.

Got the Capastrami and I must say it was nothing short of amazing. Juicy without being sloppy (in fact there was not sloppiness at all) and just the right amount of dressings and meat. The pastrami itself was flavorful and juicy with a hint of fresh spices and the serving was very generous. Next time I'll try the Bobbie which is their most famous sandwich and was told it tastes like \"Thanksgiving dinner in sandwich form\".

The prices are a bit on the high side (paid about $9.5 for it) and there might not always be a table to sit in but that should not prevent anyone from trying it, especially if you happen to be in the Santa Fe Station."}
{"text":"Went with my friends from work to caps for the first time and I have to say if your in the area this is the place to eat at bar none the best sub sandwhich I ever had in my life .... pastrami with coleslaw ad hot and sweet peppers heaven in your hands"}
{"text":"First time ordering here. It was amazing. I ordered online and the time they gave me for delivery was spot on. It came on time as expected. Meatball sub was indeed fresh with homemade meatballs. Husband got the steak and cheese and really enjoyed it. Both subs came exactly as ordered. Highly recommended and lot of sub for the price."}
{"text":"I visited this Capriotti's location at Fort Apache & Tropicana on July 21 around 1pm.  I chose to dine in.  The restaurant was very hot so I don't think a/c was working or it was not turned on.  The workers were sweating.  One kept opening the large refrigerator to fan herself.  The time to receive my meal took way too long.  Looked like they may have been short staffed.  What really blew my mind though was the fact that when I finished my meal I needed to use the restroom & to wash my hands from having a messy sandwich.  I was told that this location does not offer restrooms & that I would have to walk over to KFC to use their restroom.  I said What?!!!!  I am a paying customer & just ate in your restaurant & you cannot offer a restroom?  The worker said no & that's the way it is.  I asked for the manager & was told the same thing.  They do not have restrooms for customers.  I have never heard of such a thing!  I watched as another customer had to walk over to KFC to use their restroom after placing their order.  I was appalled!  There is absolutely no excuse not to offer restroom facilities to paying customers at the very least to wash hands since you are eating a meal there!  I could understand a little if restroom was out of order for a particular reason, but that was not the case.  Needless to say, I will not be back to this location as they obviously do not value their customers.  Bit of advice, if you do visit here, make sure you go to restroom somewhere else beforehand & bring some sanitary hand wipes with you as you will not be able to wash your hands unless you walk over to the KFC which a customer should not have to do."}
{"text":"I love capriottis need I say more?, haha there Cole turkey is life! Phillys are amazing to with extra mushrooms and chili's oh yeah! How do you capriottis? I recommend every location specially this location since its 24hours ?!!! That's a win!"}
{"text":"Tried Capriotti's when the Tempe craft fair was going on.  We were surprised to find that there were only a couple of other customers while we were there.  We split a gigantic sandwich called a Slaw B Jo (or something like that) which was made on good bread and piled with roast beef.  The cheese portion was fine.  There was a little dressing and a little slaw but, overall, the sandwich was very dry.  We asked for more dressing which was willingly provided.  It seems to be a place where local office workers go for lunch so is probably great for that, but if we were in Tempe again at mealtime, we probably wouldn't bother to go back."}
{"text":"Ridiculous wait time. No one knew what was going on. Bird flying around the kitchen area and had to wait for one sandwich for over 30 mins. No one even acknowledged me waiting  for my order. Unacceptable!!"}
{"text":"Highly recommended if you are in the mood for a casual sandwich in Vegas.  I'm in town once a month and I always stop in on every trip.  The portions are huge, the prices are great, and the sandwiches are tasty.  I usually go with the Cram-slam club but have tried a few others without disappointment.  The place is usually quiet and very casual."}
{"text":"If you're from Las Vegas, you are probably very familiar with Capriotti's.  My friends who were in town from Cali, however, were not.  We were looking for an easy sandwich place to satisfy our lunch time craves and I just knew I had to expose them to the deliciousness that is Capriotti's.
The two most popular sandwiches are by far the Bobbie and the Capistrami.  The Bobbie can be summed up as Thanksgiving on a roll, with fresh turkey meat, mayo, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.  The Capistrami has pastrami meat, thousand island dressing, swiss cheese and cole slaw.  Both are great options and I go back and forth between the two.  I've also heard the Philly Cheese Steak is pretty darn good too, but I have yet to try it.
The sandwiches always take a little longer to make at Capriotti's (especially if you are comparing to something like Subway), but we don't usually mind.  After all, it takes longer to make when its fresh. You can also call ahead and order, and I believe this location delivers!"}
{"text":"Got the \"small\" cheesesteak from here. It was plenty and was made to order quickly. It was a little pricey, though @ 11 dollars for the sandwich and a SOBE green tea but SO worth it. So glad we found this place!"}
{"text":"this is the best sandwich shop ever the staff are great clean and friendly great job Michael was the best he really takes pride in these shop well done!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.
We walked in with 30 hungry guys and they served us quick and with a smile! 
We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"My husband and I were across the street at Best Buy, we were planning to stop by Cappriottis for sandwiches for work the next day. Unfortunately, our errand at Best Buy took a little longer than expected. 

We left the store and I called Cappriottis at 8:56 pm to hopefully put in an order for 2 sandwiches just so they can get started since they close at 9 pm. Morgan \"manager\" answered the phone and I politely asked if I was able to put in a telephone order because we are literally a minute away and already driving. Morgan apologized and stated the latest order has to be put in by 8:30 pm which I understand. So I wanted to confirm if we are to get there within a minute that they would still be able to make our sandwiches. Morgan annoyingly stated \"if you guys get here before 9\". 

We got to the store at 8:57 pm. There were 3 employees, Morgan \"manager\" and 2 younger male employees. Immediately, both my husband and I can see the annoyance on all of their faces that we had come in so close to the closing time. However, the taller male employee proceeded to remain professional and took our orders. And the other male employee started on the sandwiches. Meanwhile, Morgan stood at the register impatiently waiting for us to finish our order so she can ring us up. 

We got to the register and the tone of the \"manager\" Morgan's voice was filled with annoyance and she rushed my husband through the order. I have never heard anyone spoke so fast before. Then she hurriedly asked if we have ordered mushrooms in our sandwiches. My husband couldn't hear her (how could he have, she was speaking so fast) and thought she asked if we wanted mushrooms and so my husband stated \"yes I guess we can get mushrooms\". Almost immediately, she raised her voice and rudely said \"either you got the mushrooms or you didnt so did you or did you not get the mushrooms?\" 

If this is the \"manager\" what kind of example/training/standards are you setting up for the rest of the employees? Is this behavior acceptable? Absolutely not! Yet, the other two employees were very professional, even ensuring to ask us if certain cheese or how the wrapping of the sandwiches should be done. Oh I forgot to mention, while we were waiting, Morgan was putting the stools down from the counter so loudly and rudely as if to show us she was ANGRY that we the customers have come into the store while it is technically still open. 

I LOVE Cappriottis but if this is how I am going to be treated then I would rather take my business elsewhere. Please train your \"manager\" Morgan to take pointers from the other two male employees. Despite the rudeness and unprofessional manners from Morgan, we were so impressed with the other two employees, we made sure to tip $20 just to let them know we appreciated them for accommodating us coming so close to closing time. The two stars are obviously for those two. Needless to say, we will not be coming back to this location. The other location on eastern and 215 is way more professional and efficient so if you are close and have to choose, I recommend coming to the 215 and Eastern location you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"They have an excellent Philly Cheesesteak.  They also have a solid Turkey sandwich called the Bobbie.  It has real turkey as opposed to cold cuts.  Highly recommend for  sandwiches."}
{"text":"Id give it no stars if that was possible. Just stopped in and placed my order. When the order was ready i went to the register to pay and they would not accept my payment! I had an old hundred dollar bill and they accused me that the money was FAKE!!! They stood there and compared the hundred to a current hundred dollar bill!!!! LOL!!!! Obviously there are some major differances!!! I dont see how a employee is not educated in forms of payment and does not know how to verify a old hundred dollar bill when they are still in circulation. Completely unprofessional!"}
{"text":"Almost gave this place 4 stars, but 3 is more on target -- still, if you're looking for a place to eat well and cheap in Vegas, this one's a great choice. 

The selling point -- high quality meat (especially their turkey and roast beef - these aren't deli slices, but instead are the real deal), and hearty sandwiches that don't skimp on the toppings.  Their small was more than enough to fill me up - it's a 9-inch sandwich, but loaded.

The Bobbie is my favorite so far -- turkey, stuffing and cranberry -- Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  The stuffing is what makes it -- really nice flavor.  I've also tried the Slaw B Joe - a roast beef sandwich with cole slaw.  A bit messy, but also good flavor, and I'm not a huge roast beef fan.

I'd rank this as #2 on my Vegas sandwich list (with Earl of Sandwich taking the top spot if we're only focusing on sandwich quality), but hard to beat Capriotti's for overall value, plus a taste of the local vibe."}
{"text":"My sister already warned me to expect the sandwich to be cold because the first time she ate it, she was expecting a hot sandwich. We ordered The Bobbie, which is basically a Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich: turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. It was good and wish I had more cranberry sauce in my portion. The sandwich would get 3.5 stars.

My reason to round down: I came with a group of 7 and half of them had to go to the restroom. We claim two tables to sit and I was at a table that sits two, thinking no one else would sit at the other chair because I'm here. Not true. You would think if someone is sitting at a table, you'll find a different spot or at least ask if he/she can sit there. Well not in this case. This guy just sat down and his friend was standing between us. I didn't really care to begin with because I'm thinking they're just waiting for their to-go orders. Nope. They got their orders first and started eating at the table I claimed. The guy standing placed his sandwich in front of me (although, I had my back to them) like it's his spot. WTH... So when it was our turn to eat, we had to hold it in our hands while those two jerks got the table."}
{"text":"This place is in my return list. I will get The bobbienext time, And they have we cater."}
{"text":"I can order my cheese steak from here at work! Awesome! GrubHub driver was pretty fast, so I got my sandwich hot. Love that they stack the filing so it's not all bread LIKE SOME OTHER SANDWICH PLACES."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here. Fast and friendly service. Good lunch place and close to shopping at downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best sandwiches ever!

I love to get the largest size of the Capistrami, which is actually quite heavenly!"}
{"text":"I was near Stratosphere and wanted lunch. I found this spot. The place was not crowded. It had about 10 customers when i walked in to which the establishment looked to accommodate 30 people. The menu has a variety of offerings. I ordered the shortest capastrami sandwich with a bottle soda. The combination of ingredients were outstanding. Great balance of the amount of meat, veggie and dressing. I left still feeling hungry so you might want to grab a bag of chips or longer sandwich to fill you up. Nice location and easy to find. The pace of service is average which i thought can be improved."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch bunch to get a good sandwich.  Salads are not bad either."}
{"text":"This WAS our go-to sandwich shop until we ordered online for pick up at 16th/Bethany on one of our hectic weeknights. Got home with the grub and my husband's Capistrami had NOTHING on it but cheese and pastrami. No Russian sauce. No Slaw. It was inedible. But, it was late and we were tired and didn't have it in us to drive the 6 miles back to reorder, so we shared the other 2 sandwiches between the 3 of us. My husband called to let them know, expecting to at least get a refund on that sandwich. The person who answered the phone took down our name/number and said he'd have the manager call us right back. That was 4 days ago. We're trying Scott's Generations next. Much closer to home too."}
{"text":"Are you kidding? Today was the FIRST time I've been here, and seriously probably the last. We walked in about at about 3 in the afternoon, and there was no one in sight, with rap music blaring. Then outcome two teenagers, who didn't even greet us, they just waited at the register until we were ready to order. Our friend from Vegas was with us and suggested this place to us, saying it was the best sub place he's ever been to. He orders, then I order. I ordered the Italian, and a ham and cheese sandwich. About 15 minutes later, that's right 15 MINUTES later we finally got our subs. Our friends looked delicious, meanwhile my sub order was so confusing. The Italian was written on mine, and it was okay. However there was no condiments on it. My fiancé's sub was a ham and cheese, it didn't even have cheese on it, and again no condiments. The bread was so thick, all I could taste was bread. Because I was starving, I ate half of mine but couldn't bear to eat the second half. I wanted to ask an employee about the cheese not being on there, and why our subs were so bland and dry, however looking up, once again NOT A SINGLE EMPLOYEE IN SIGHT. But between the obnoxious blaring rap shit, I could hear them cracking up in the backroom. Something was clearly more important than their only customers in their store at the time. After getting up and looking at the menu, I then see in fine print that I had to ask for condiments! Funny because when I got to the counter to place my order, the airhead girl behind the counter didn't say one word to me. She only gave me the total, normally when you go somewhere they suggest or ask what you would like on your order. Nope! Not this time! I also ordered a large drink, and I got diet soda, well it tasted watered down, and they clearly needed to change the tap or whatever. I went for another drink, same thing. Disgusting. This place however, has great potential. Clearly, the people here are the reason why I'm pissed. Not the food. Management here needs to boot these two twats, and get some people who have a sense of urgency, and are willing to make suggestions, and aren't just dicking around in the back when no one is watching. I give it two stars because I'm sure that if the little blonde behind the register suggested toppings, then my sub would of been all that I hoped for, considering I was starving, so one star for the food, and a second star for the amount you get for your money. Probably the WORST customer service at a restaurant I've ever had!!! How hard is it to make a sub?! And you took 15 minutes to NOT put CHEESE on our ham and CHEESE!? As soon as they were done they threw our bags on the counter, and disappeared into the back again. No wonder why I always go to Spinato's or Jimmy John's. I've never heard about this place until today, I guess there was a good reason."}
{"text":"Capriotti's hoagies remind me of the hoagies I had growing up in Philadelphia, PA. I'm so glad I can get a little taste of home on the opposite side of the country! 
I always pick up my order and they always have it ready. The rolls here are awesome.  
Capriotti's knows that a cheese steak is not a slab of meat on a roll with some cheese melting on top! (Thank goodness one business got it right in Las Vegas of all places!) 
I've had cold hoagies, cheese steak, meatball sandwich and the Bobbie here and they were all great! 
If you're looking for an authentic CHEESE STEAK or HOAGIE, Caps got it.
If you want a sub... stick with Subway (ugh)."}
{"text":"The owner and mgmt. just DONT CARE. Why is it that this location has the worst review of any capriottis in town ? I rest my case."}
{"text":"Great ingredients. Bread has a very rubber texture. Almost as if you want to cut the crust off like when you were a kid except its a hoagie and its all crust."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident, and sure glad I did.

Most sandwich joints are the same old deli meat subs, but this place is a bit different.

I ordered a turkey sub and I was delighted to see the turkey was whole pieces, pulled from the breast. What a great, fresh tasting sub."}
{"text":"Good service. Had the vegetarian cheesesteak which was a little bland than i would expect. I took some of the tofu out but the few grilled veggies were not so bad."}
{"text":"This place is always good, I think the owner actually made my sandwich last time I was there , owner or manager, anyway it was superb! quite flavorful, even the next day it tasted just as good. Grab a Capistrami you can't go wrong, until next time Cappie's , be well."}
{"text":"Ok so I drove by this shop today and saw how they were voted best sandwich, so for lunch i decided to order online for myself, coworker and daughter, which was about 25 dollars. My daughters sandwich had specific instructions for what she wanted on it, when we received the sandwich it was missing the veggies and we were missing her chips. I double checked my email with the order in it to make sure I ordered what I thought I ordered and I was right. I ordered the turkey for myself which was a sad turkey sandwich that looked like a three year old made it. So needless to say, this is far from the best sandwich place"}
{"text":"i love this place i work down the street from here and i always call in and have my food hot and ready when i come to pick up"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! We get their sandwiches for our office all the time. We always get the pastrami and the Bobby. They're great everytime! Five stars hands down."}
{"text":"Less than enthusiastic employees here. Sandwich was decent but the service was so off putting I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Got here 3 hours before they closed to use some gift cards I got and they were out of bread.  Awesome"}
{"text":"Oooooh the Pastrami is the best!!!  I get a craving for this sandwich!  It's a little  on the pricey side, but I believe they use quality meat and the sandwiches are HUGE!  

You try it once, you'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"If I could possibly rate them any lower then one star I would, I understand lunch rushes can be stressful but I can assure you I will never return to this location anytime of the day period . My boyfriend and I called in a simple order for pick up, one cran-slam and one Bobbie both medium size on white bread .. Pretty straight forward order, at least we thought so . After being told it would be a thirty minute wait for our sandwiches to be ready we ran an errand or two and headed to pick up our food. Once inside we could already sense exactly how this would eventually play out . After waiting 5-7 minutes in line, apparently our sandwiches weren't finished yet. We paid for our food and sat and waited, and waited and waited .. 12:20 is when we called in our order and it was 1:15 by the time we were handed over \"what we had ordered\" we couldn't have been more disappointed . The order was completely wrong and \"Tiffany\" I believe, began to tell my boyfriend that he was wrong. Completely ridiculous. She should practice listening more over a phone call instead of interrupting during an order. My boyfriend repeated himself multiple times and to no avail. Good job, Tiff. The only positive thing that came out of our hour wait was the help of the manager Joseph. He refunded us for our sandwiches and apologized for the inconvenience. We wasted an entire hour, left with no sandwiches and proceeded to my first choice of Jersey Mikes .. 

Highly recommend finding any other location than this one ."}
{"text":"The Bobbie is the greatest creation known to man. Being that there are like a million locations in las Vegas, this has to be the best one in the north west area. They are very friendly and are quick to greet anyone who walks through their doors. I've never had any problems with food or service at this location or any other for that matter. This is a truly classy sub spot for a good price!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. The guy in the front (Possibly the owner) recommended a sandwich.... Cole Turkey which had Russian dressing and cole slaw.  It was pretty good I must admit. 

The russian dressing made me feel like I was in Russia again. I'm kidding, I've never been to Russia."}
{"text":"They have multiple vegetarian options which is really nice. Their veggie turkey is delicious! The staff is always very friendly too which makes it easy to swing through for lunch. They also just launched their ap with a rewards program."}
{"text":"Sitting here back at my desk in LA, makes me a bit sad with no easy access to Capriottis. 

We were searching thru yelp to where to go for lunch, and this came up. A Vegas resident said this place was the shit... and hey it was right by the hotel so why not! 

After my visit to Capriottis, all I can say is that I want more! Very yum to the Capistrami, like usual, I got a bit greedy and got the medium. I was full after the first half but didn't want it to go to waste cause it tasted so good! It was a perfect blend of warm pastrami and the cold Cole slaw inside of a fresh tasting roll. 

My friend got the Bobbie, said it was good but she'd def like it more if they warmed up the sandwich. 

This place is definitely one to add to my go to list while in Vegas :P"}
{"text":"This is hands down the BEST place for a sub!!!! I have been to several different locations and have always had super friendly service and great quality food. Luckily there are many throughout the Vegas area but I would drive all day long to get to one of them. If you haven't tried it, you have been missing out! P.S Don't forget to leave the staff some \"beer money\" (tip)! :)"}
{"text":"Sandwiches don't get better than this! The Bobbie is my favorite but the Capistrami is a very close second and then the cheese steak! They're HUGE too!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches made here.. just the way they make it. They don't skimp on the meat. Other Capriotti's location just aren't the same. I always order the Italian"}
{"text":"The Bobbie was a delicious. Like Thanksgiving in your mouth. It's so good once it hits your lips it's so good"}
{"text":"These guys are always on point with their sandwiches. My husband and I come here on a regular basis. The ingredients are fresh and tasty. Today's visit however left somewhat a 'bad taste' in my mouth. Not because of the food mind you but because of our cashier- Jennifer.. My husband and I are heavily tattooed, with that being said people will ask us about tattoo's and even try to get quotes on tattoo's. We don't mind this what we do mind is when people like Jennifer show us tattoo work on them from scratchers/ kitchen magicians- these are people who tattoo illegally out of their homes!! Not only is this illegal bit it's not safe! So it really gets me worked up when they think the work they got done is good and when they think my husband charges too much money. He works for a very well know established tattoo shop. Typically when people tattoo out if their home there's a reason for this. They suck!
I just thought this was very unprofessional and honestly she may have hepatitis from getting tattooed in someone's kitchen so we will not be returning to this location! Good luck Jennifer with your shitty tattoo's & scratcher artist."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is the best place around for delicious sandwiches!  I just had the capastrami and it was incredible.  The pastrami was nice and lean (well, as lean as pastrami gets) and they piled it high on a great roll with lots of crunchy slaw and a tasty russian dressing.  But the kicker is to ask for some of the hot pepper relish on the side.  Try it on the sandwich and you'll never look back.  Amazing!

The Bobbie is also really good and so is the plain old turkey sandwich (I got it on the kaiser roll).

I like this location because it's never too too crowded and the service is always fast and friendly.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Capriottis is usually really good consistent food, but at this shop they are not very customer service friendly.
the issue is always the service here.
Today I tired to call to place an order for lunch, which is 30 min long...
I called to place my order she put me on hold for 11 min, I hung up called back, I called back 8 times, i called them EIGHT TIMES at 11 30 in the afternoon on a Tuesday and no one answered the phone, what is going on here? I spent 20 min out of my 30 min lunch just trying to order my food. this is some shameful shit capriottis get it together."}
{"text":"What I got: 12\" Cheesesteak with extra peppers

Pros: the sandwich was great. The mixture of cheese, peppers and steak worked well together.

Cons: the beef steak was a tad bit dry. The cheese made up for the lack of moisture."}
{"text":"Only reason it didn't get a 1 is because the sandwich was good. When I was waiting for my name to be called, a guy in the back screwed up a sandwich, which is totally fine. What got me is how his manager subtly tried to berate him for it instead of handling it like any decent human would - he completely ridiculed him. Don't see how it benefits anybody if he continues to mock his employees. Pathetic"}
{"text":"Well nicolas  you missed out on good food cuz  a guy had a smoke before he served you.  Get over it ya baby.  Bartenders smoke all the time then get you ,a drink get over it.  This is a site for opinions but not babys."}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect when I first walked in with my friend who recommended this place. He goes,\" just order the Bobbie and thank me later.\" One Word: Delicious. It was all the thanksgiving goodness in a sandwich all year around. If ever you find yourself exploring beyond the strip, go find Capriotti's and order the Bobbie, you can thank me later as well."}
{"text":"I had the Bobbie. All the best sandwich in America bragging just made this mediocre sandwich seem that much worse. Dry turkey, rubbery bread. It wasn't so bad I didn't finish it, but I won't be coming back. If you can't get to an actual deli, then any other chain sandwich shops beat this place."}
{"text":"I have to give a 3 star rating because Capriotti's is all around such good food but If I didn't feel so bad going lower for services I would. Tonight I considered ordering food from Capriotti's using post mates until I saw a $17 delivery fee. So I called in and pre ordered because my whole family is getting over a stomach bug and I just wanted to get in and out as quickly as possible. I ordered a cold turkey sandwich (as per the label on post mates), A bobbie with no cranberry, a child turkey and cheese and chicken noodle soup. I got home and I had a Cole Turkey (my fault) and a medium Bobbie with cranberry. Not knowing about the cole turkey I called and very nicely explained that the majority of my order was wrong. The blonde that works annoyingly schooled me on what the cole turkey was and that it would be no problem if I got back into the store by eight to remake my sandwiches. I get it its close to closing time but she felt the need to point the sandwiches I order out on the board call me babe (if you work in customer service you know babe is not something you say) and I got barely any turkey on both remakes and no mayo on the Bobbie (I checked to make sure that it comes with that.) What upset me the most was her calling me babe thats weird."}
{"text":"Wow...I love this place! No matter who is behind the counter, the sandwiches arrive deliciously and as ordered. I find the cheesesteak to be a family favorite and personal best. I like the way the food is cooked on the grill that can be seen by anyone coming into the restaurant. 

I appreciate the fact that the sandwiches represent quality and they never cease to inspire."}
{"text":"This location service leaves a lot to be desired - ordered 3 subs - 2 cold 1 hot - at 7PM 12/8/2015. big problem - 

While waiting for my hot sandwich (the cold ones were sitting there made) - another customer walks in - that person gets a greeting(lacking on my entry) and places his order (mind you after my order was placed) - they girl behind the counter proceeds to make his hot sandwich and he left before me! then they were able to finally make my hot sandwich - she goes on break.... not sure where the manager will fit in all of this. I finally got to leave with my  3 subs 40 minutes after i order -

the food at capriottis is normally pretty good - however the Turkey cole ordered at this location wasn't made the correct way - no dressing, no mayo no coleslaw - and it was not ordered that way.

if you want Capriotti's order from Junction - hope they expand their delivery area!"}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is something special! Only sandwich we've ever tried is the hot cheese steak with hot peppers added to it. it's just something special.. I've never ever in my life eaten a sandwich without condiments.. lol. not joking.. even bbq pork sandwiches I put mayo & mustard on.. lol. I can't stand dry food. This is just the steak peppers and chz all mixed & put on this soft amazing bread.. the bread is the finishing touch.. lol.  We need to try some new items but the cheese steak is just so yummy :)"}
{"text":"This one is the closest to my house but they are all the same.  Before the new management took over the company and started sprouting shops all across the western US, Capriottis was THE best sandwich shop in Vegas. I am ashamed to say that while going to UNLV, I never once visited the Capriottis next to the campus. Had I know what was 'so great about some small sandwich shop', my college years would have been much happier.  

Anyways, the sandwiches are amazing. My favorites are the Capastrami and the famous Bobbie. If your looking for THE best hot sandwich in the world, get the Capastrami. Its loaded with pastrami and cheese, and topped with coleslaw and russian dressing ... RIDICULOUS!

 As far as cold sandwiches are concerned, nothing compares to the Bobbie. Its filled with pulled turkey meat (white and dark), stuffing, and cranberry sauce. Order the small and you'll be surprised by the nine inch sandwich they give you. Looking for a food coma? order the 20\" large. The guys and gals working are always fun, yelling \"beer money guys!\" everytime patrons leave them a tip. 

There is so much more to this little sandwich shop that I can't even begin to scratch the surface. The bread is amazing, the sandwich selections are vast and mouth-watering, the atmosphere is great, and the prices are great. Like I said, BEST in LAS VEGAS!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great family owned sandwich shop franchise. All I their sandwiches are good, but their specialty selections are amazing. The Bobbie is amazing, and like thanksgiving dinner on a hoagie. The Cole Turkey, Slaw-be-joe and Capastrami are also amazing. I'd frequently order a large, get it cut into thirds, and have a delicious meal for later. You can call ahead and pick  up the food for later. They also let you get party platters, and the folks at work were always impressed when I bought Capriotti's."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their sandwhiches here. i love a good authentic sub and these guys have it. They have a neat reward program via text and an app. 
They saw my 7yr old daughter eye balling the Chocolate Chocolate Chip brownies...they must lf known i was going to say \"not today sweetheart\" because they immediately asked if she was allowed to have one. They gave her an ear to ear smile at no charge. Good in my book!  tasty food nice service. Thx Capriotti's"}
{"text":"My honey and I tried out the Harmon St and Paradise location and loved it. They have a few booths and a couple tables there. We ordered the Capastrami and the Hot Sausage with the peppers and onions. And the Capastrami was heavenly. I'm not a huge fan of cole slaw but this combination is amazing. I can only imagine the cravings I'm going to have for this sandwich. Next time we're going to have to try the Bobbie...... We'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Went back because my 4.99 bowl of soup was barely half full. Asked them to make it right and I received different bowls that were again, half full. This can't be the way capriotti's works seeing as the sandwiches are busting out of the seams because they are so full. I don't think we will be going back."}
{"text":"Not a fan! I ordered the Italian and asked for the smallest sub possible.
For $11 I got 9\" of old bread. The veggies were not fresh. The meat was mediocre at best. The sandwhich sucked. I truly believe Subway could do a better job. Chips were good. Soda was spot on. I ended up tossing it except the 3 bites I took.  Never coming back."}
{"text":"Standards are great when it comes to franchises.  You expect a certain product and as long as that happens younger satisfied so this place is a no brainer.  You always get what you are expecting.  My only issue with this spot that causes my average rating is I think the prices are too high. Lower the prices and I would come more often and give you more stars but price does play into my ratings."}
{"text":"As a previous person stated, this is definitley not the establishment for 5 star service but I love the sandwiches. Personal fav: the Bobby... It's like thanksgiving on a sandwich:)"}
{"text":"I never had a cheese steak till I moved here  to Las Vegas , mmm I think there sandwich is the best , I only wish they had French Fries :)"}
{"text":"It's kind of difficult for me to order since am new to US, I just asked for the most popular one, and it was surprisingly good and unsurprisingly huge:)"}
{"text":"If your looking for Philly sandwiches in Vegas. This is a good stop. As close as your going to get. They also have Wise potato chips and TastyKake."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches just miss.

The pastrami, steak and turkey are plentiful, but flavorless.

I have had better at other Capriotti's and certainly at other sandwich shops."}
{"text":"Fast service, tasty sandwiches, and salad options available for non bread eaters."}
{"text":"Anybody that gives this place more than 1 star has either been paid off or is an idiot.  I mean the food is about average, but when you are pay $15+ for a sandwitch, you might expect a LITTLE customer service since you are paying for about 3 bucks worth of food. Anyways, I go to this place, get my sandwitch, drop 4 bucks in the tip jar, then when the lady gives me my 40 or whatever cents of change, I say you can throw that in the tip jar. She replies \"Ooohhhhh thhaAAAaanks\" as sarcastically as she could, I'm asuming she didn't see the rest of the money I put in. I just think \"wow, I wish I could talk to a manager about this wench\". Long story short, turns out that the old hag IS the manager. I come by a couple weeks later and the lady glares at me the whole time like shes holding the tip against me or something. Forget it, if im paying THAT much for a sandwitch, you should be kissing my ass and shining my shoes. Not going there again, and I don't reccomend anyone else does. Faster the place gets shut down, the faster a better place can take its spot. Also let me mention that I completely had to reactivate my yelp acount to post this review, THATS how bad the service is."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's not far from where I work and that's a small problem.  The Capastromi and Grilled Italian are delicious."}
{"text":"I showed up last minute for a catering order.  The staff was able to throw my order together very quickly and get me on my way.  The quality was consistent with their usual high standards. I am grateful for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Stopped by once to grab some sandwiches dinner time and they were closed.  Not sure why they keep shortened hours but I was in the mood for a Bobbie and had to settle for some KFC next door,"}
{"text":"This is a very busy lunch spot as it is in a high traffic location.  The parking lot is small and always full and the restaurant is small as well offering very few tables.  Food is very consistent with all the other Capriottis.  I do recommend this place for lunch however it would behoove you to call ahead and take it to go."}
{"text":"definitely the best sandwiches in vegas and they offer vegetarian options (not just a bunch of lettuce on a bun, but real veg food) a definite must try :)"}
{"text":"Watery tasteless broccoli cheese soup.  Turkey sandwich made of remnant turkey pieces, not slices.  All around gross ripoff!  Avoid!"}
{"text":"My sandwich is never messed up, its perfect every time. The staff is super friendly and attentive. Love this location so much. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Friendly people... Great service... Sandwich a bit dry but still awesome ... Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"Wish i could put a big fat zero .  Stood in line for 15 mins to place an order for two italian subs and they have NO FREAKIN ITALIAN MEAT.  Its a wed for god sake.  How can you not have supplies. Not doing that ever again. Went across the street to Niccolis, they have better Italian anyway!!  Please ho somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE sandwich place! The sandwiches are incredible. The use shredded beef and turkey that gives the sandwich so much more flavor. The people working there are always plesant and helpful. I have tried several and have never been disappointed. They are large sandwiches and great for sharing."}
{"text":"This place is fucking disgusting. My friend and I went to get some food here and she found 5 small hairs in her sandwich.. We knew they did it on purpose because they took such a long time to give it to us and served everyone else before us when we were they first. And to top it off, my friend and I came back to get a refund and when we walked in the guy on the register said \"uh oh\" and they guy preparing the sandwiches ran to the back.. They did this on purpose! I will contact your manager and fire all of you."}
{"text":"Cappriotti's is my go to place when in doubt. They have so many choices, even with their simple set up. It's a lot more unique than other sub places, just because of their meat. You can sense the difference after one bite. I feel like it's just better quality, it's either that or the \"shreddedness\" of it making it easier to munch on. Either way I can't go wrong when I come here.

My personal favorites are their turkey, steak and cheese (I love it with onions and peppers, real spicy!), the Bobbie (when I really want to let it all go lol) and their sandwiches instead of their subs.

Be careful when you order, a small is quite enough to feed one person. Medium can feed two. And a large can feed a small family!

This particular store is good, I really feel the family vibe and the workers are really laid back. I always give them a tip since it goes to their \"beer money\", and I respect the honesty.

Keep in mid though, their subs are a little bit more pricey than other places but I classify then as \"quality over quantity\".

Overall, whether your driving by or planning on going out of your way.. Cappriotti's is a good place to choose for a sub other than the 'robotic' subway or quizno's."}
{"text":"Great value! The 20inch sub could feed 4 people! Massive.
Had the cheesesteak, it was a tad dry but other than that it was fabulous. 
The buliding gets a little crowded kind of quick.
Was a little confused on where to place the order."}
{"text":"I liked that it was real turkey on the sandwich. The guy saidnthat it was pulled of the Turkey every morning. The chesse steak was also really good. I had to give them a 4 because I asked for mustard and they didn't give me any so my Turkey reminded me of Tuna. Overall I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Forget Jared and Subway.

This is the place for a sandwich!!!

Try it, you will like it."}
{"text":"Bleh. I'm from around Philly and this place is extremely disappointing.  Steak sandwich is dry. Owner is rude and cocky about subpar food. They would not be in business long on the east coast."}
{"text":"My 4 friends and I were disappointed today when we drove over 10 miles to your sandwich shop on Fort Apache. We arrived @ 7:25pm and the shop was closed! The store hours say open until 8:00pm and there were at least 2 employees inside but no one would let us in. We ended up going across the street  to Arby's. Major bummer!"}
{"text":"Worse fucking place ever. Called ahead to place an order and they kept me on hold for 15 minutes. I hung up and called back and they did the same thing. Terrible customer service. I showed at the store and all the employees have a nasty attitude. I left the store and went to Pops. Fuck you guys. I love the sandwiches but I'll never buy from this location again."}
{"text":"I last tried a Capriotti's meatball 8 years ago. Today I decided to give them a 2nd go. 

The only good thing I can say is that my sandwich was hot.  The bread was soft too but upon my first bite I knew why: the bread wasn't baked enough. It was gummy.  The meatballs were flavorless & did not look or taste fresh; the sauce?  More tomato chunks than sauce...I tossed the whole thing. 

Currently looking for lunch to replace this one so if anyone has suggestions other than Capriotti's...I'll never go to a Capriotti's again."}
{"text":"Good place every one that is complaining about the phone order online stop complaining. Never had a bad sandwich so please don't go by these stupid peoples reviews."}
{"text":"Last Tuesday I had The Bobbie sub.  It was good but dry.  There's a place in Eagle Rock, CA that serves The Pilgrim sub.  It has the same ingredients as The Bobbie but they add gravy to the sandwich.  This makes it a much juicer sandwich and it tastes better.  My wife got the regular Turkey sub that comes with coleslaw  on it.  The coleslaw was so cold it almost seemed frozen."}
{"text":"This location no longer allows you to eat at the establishment. Take out only. 

I've tried \"the bobbie\" in the past. It is with their homemade turkey, cranberry sauce & stuffing. Not a fave of mine, but it is definitely something different and full of yummy thanksgiving flavor anytime of the year. 

I got a small genoa salami ($6) today and it was HUGE. I couldn't even eat it all and still have half of it waiting in the fridge. All the subs come with provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and choice of sweet or hot peppers, mayo, oil, etc. They don't have a lot of choices in toppings, but pretty much the basics, which is just fine with me!

The bread is freshly made in house and they are not shy or stingy when it comes to piling on the meat (unlike subway!). After a couple of bites into my sandwich, the fillings were oozing out and couldn't keep up with the bread! By the last bite, I had a little piece of bread with majority of it being meat and lettuce.

Service here is good, the guys who work there are very friendly. Service is fast too."}
{"text":"\"Thanksgiving in June...\"

Dude.. Why is everyone keeping this place a secret from me? They know I jones for a good sammich. They know I need my sammich fix. And they know how I get down after Thanksgiving Day, cause leftover turkey is the business. So today I didn't feel like eating pre-sliced and pre-stacked lunch meats served to me, and others, like we are in an Elementary School Cafeteria. So I went here with the expectations of it being similar to a Jersey Mike's or something. As soon as I read the menu, I was like \"Wait!!!... REAL Turkey??\"...I didn't go with the Bobbie.. I went here on lunch, and dozing in a 2pm meeting is just not cool... So regular one for me with ALL the fixins. First bite and I'm trying to get to the kitchen so I can Hi-Five the little lady breaking down 15lb BUTTERBALLS all-day. She deserves a gold medal and a sticker... Needless to say, I was very satisfied.. So lose the process meats and come here instead.. Cucumbers don't belong on a sammich anyway.. And I'm going back tomorrow to try a Hot Sub..."}
{"text":"This may be my favorite sandwich spot. I love the fresh pulled turkey meat. Non of that processed mystery meat turkey here. Great place for a quick, tasty lunch."}
{"text":"Love the Italian and cheese steak. The Italian is very classic and hardy. Saves well and is also great hot! The cheese steak with simply done onions and a little bit of hot peppers oh yeah! Perhaps some extra cheese, if you're feeling feisty. Been eating there for years! Also the Capasrami is a great way to mix it up! Some times nothing else will satisfy! They have their hiccups with accuracy every now and again but they are always more than willing to make amends with a smile! I always forgive them, we all make mistakes! It's how the mistakes are handled that say the most about a place! One of the best lunch destinations ever!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite sandwich places to go to. They always make the best, huge filled, delicious, tasteful, sandwiches that leave you wanting more even after you are stuffed! I love The Meatball sub and the Capastrami. The Bobbie and the cheese steak sub are amazing too!! We order to go and they are always fast! The food stays nice and hot, they wrap them so well, I don't know how they do it. They are always clean inside and are always nice, great customer service. You get what you pay for. We are always satisfied! Their hours are great, so glad they are open late, till 8pm or 9pm depending where you go."}
{"text":"this sandwich shop is one if the best I've been to. The best ones that I've had are the slaw be jo, Cole turkey, and the pastrami very good. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes sandwiches."}
{"text":"Got the order wrong. Ordered two smells  but she keyed in a medium and didn't offer to fix it. So I love caps but now I'll have leftovers I didn't intend to have. 

By the way, greeting us is nice, but yelling \"Hey!\" Is a bit less than professional. 

So I was grouchy and hungry when I wrote the above, but after eating such a good sub so I changed my 3 to a 4 star. Yum!"}
{"text":"Oh my...
From the cashier cleaning out the grill finally taking my order to the lack of acknowledgement about my order to the no thank you to no offer to get my chips or free dessert I have never experienced this at caps. 
Oh and I gave all my change of $1.xx as a tip with zero recognition?  I ordered fries but was told that it would be more than 15 minutes before I could hope to have any. So switched to chips. The selection of kids lunch bag 1 oz chips was small. 

Then the loaded everything request was ignored, one slice of \"meat\" one slice of tomato in each side of a 12 inch and very little lettuce and NOTHING else. What does loaded mean anyhow?

The sandwich was dry. 

The price went up since last time. My $9.49 12 inch sandwich to me was valued at 3.99 I could find at 7-11. No joke. 

My last visit was met with a 8\" veggie coming to my wife with turkey meat. Wouldn't think to ask about being faked out with real turkey. My wife has been vegetarian for years. But due to lighting and a cold she ate some of it. Was told when we brought it to the attention of staff that she ate most of it so what did we expect?  Upon my notifying them of their mistake and my expectation to replace it they did after the staff said not to ever expect that they would replace it again after she ate it. 

I'm disappointed caps,  I suppose my many previous visits will not be met by future visits after two very negative experiences.   Seriously?  You want to pay how much?  Yeah, no there's lots of other choices at gvr. Might see caps go the same path as the wrap place and the villa pizza place soon."}
{"text":"Went to caps today best sandwich ever and the little red head cashier was so sweet and adorable, will definitely be going back good work"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches , everthing we order was delicious.  Will be returning when on that side of town."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times now and EVERYTHING has been terrible...from 25 min to make a sandwich at 3pm on a Monday with only 2 other guests in the store....to terrible customer service and mess up my sandwich EVERYTHING and then have the nerve to roll eyes and huff and puff about their mess up! This location is HORRIBLE and I will NEVER come back here again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fantastic sandwiches! Open 24/7! The breakfast sandwiches are incredible as well. Went there everyday on my trip! Great staff as well!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.   My favorite sandwich place in Vegas by far.  Customer service is usually great but i have been very disappointed lately.  Especially when ordering take out, don't even bother.   The guy was clearly out smoking and left me on hold for ever."}
{"text":"They have amazing subs and a great selection of vegetarian subs. It's not exactly cheap, but it's worth it. The Russian dressing that they put on some of the subs is the best. You can also download the cap addicts app to earn free subs."}
{"text":"Their phone never works. You have to go in to order. They close early often and use the same sign every time that says they ran out of buns. Fishy business."}
{"text":"Had a chicken cheesesteak with some chips and staff was very friendly. Food came out quick and was delicious. The reviews are no joke. Quality sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Staff makes me give it 2 stars... counter girl: not very relaxed nor friendly, like dealing with a quick-serve surgeon.  Cold sub girl: like she was strolling threw the park, take your time, relax, I'll still be here in an hour."}
{"text":"Amazing subs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!24/7!! Good prices. Just don't expect to get fries to go with that sandwich."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town trust. It's an east coast thing. All ingredients used are fresh!"}
{"text":"I can barely give this store 2 stars but the service was good and that was about it.  We ordered the cole turkey, one of the best sandwiches on earth and we mistakenly asked for no cheese and extra cole slaw. So they gave us a cole slaw sandwich with a hint of turkey.  I was really disappointed.  Will never do that again.  If I ever order no cheese I will say extra meat instead (or nothing at all).  

We had to use the restroom but they don't have one.   Argh.  Makes you wonder if the staff has to hold it in all day."}
{"text":"What a shame when a great foodie place goes down hill so fast. I have been eating at this Capriotti's for quite a while and my last 2 visits have confirmed my worst fear. They no longer care about the quality of food like they used too. They no longer have any concern for getting the order right the first time, and they no longer do their best to get the food out fast. All young help too busy socializing with their friends and co workers. Managers who don't work normal hours so customers can talk to them. No one at the store has any information about how to contact corporate? Hard to believe. Oh well another favorite bites the dust because it is poorly managed."}
{"text":"Just absolutely never returning here again!! It's a shame too because something different and fun came to the Eastside. I remember when this locale opened. 

What shame it is to come in 20 mins to closing to be told there are no more rolls. Uh huh! Yeah sure.  What this person didn't count on was there was a person with car trouble right outside the shop. We decided to stay and help. I watched this same person who told me there were \" no more rolls\" make sandwiches for himself.  How would I know that?? Because no one else showed up and we were there long past closing time. In fact this same man who lied also ran out to go talk to his ride while still wearing his food service gloves.  Then after that and I watched him package his sandwiches then he started cleaning the front counter.  Apparently this location is no longer interested in making money or keeping customers.  I am extremely pissed because he cheated my children out of a good dinner that happened to be late that night. Thanks so much."}
{"text":"Great tasting sandwiches. Its a little pricey thou"}
{"text":"for all those looking for a sub go somewhere else. they make hoagies at caps and will put any new York sub to shame."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's! 

The Capastrami has got to be the best sandwich ever. I love how they grill the pastrami instead of boiling it like the other sandwich place. The bread is soft and flavorful and the fact that coleslaw comes on a couple different sandwiches is a cake topper.

At this particular location, I placed a last minute super bowl order and they were able to accommodate with no issues. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  My daughter and I had 1/2 sandwich and soup. She had the cheese steak and I had the cold turkey sandwich. We both had the chicken noodle. The sandwiches were great! The soup was great but sooooooo hot. It was great when we could eat it. We really loved the guy taking our order. He was so thoughtful and nice!  Such great service!"}
{"text":"Hoagies are ok.
I go there mainly to buy the Wise chips I used to eat as a kid back in PA.

Until they get Cheez Whiz, they get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Female black employee completely rude probably has never had any type of customer service training ever in her life! Other then her none of the employees are on the same page about anything everyone acts like they don't know what's going on..... I ordered a sandwich by phone the person making it seemed like he was rushing me off the phone and then when I got home had the wrong order.... The only thing they offered was for me to drive back to their location and take the sandwich back"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the sandwiches from here and service is friendly. Be careful ordering from the app or online if you have special instructions. Picked up my sandwich today and don't have the hot and sweet peppers that I requested."}
{"text":"As other reviews have mentioned, the turkey is really the highlight here at Capriotti's.  I'm not usually a fan of turkey sandwiches, because sliced turkey tends to be kind of dismal, but Capriotti's turkey is pulled and it makes for a delicious sandwich.  

The other things I've tried have been good too.  The roast beef is nice, although it doesn't crush its competitors as convincingly as the turkey does.  The Capastrami (hot pastrami, coleslaw, Swiss cheese, and Russian dressing) was a little odd but perfectly edible.  The Swiss cheese was essentially undetectable, but that's okay with me since Swiss is probably my least favorite cheese.

All the subs are served on great bread (soft, but still substantial enough to not fall apart after being inundated with mayo and piled high with fixings) and come in one of three sizes (9, 12, or 20 inch).  The prices are very good, so even a sub capable of feeding you for two days is affordable.

Capriotti's seems like the kind of place that would do well downtown.  There's not much reason to go out to the far west side where they're located, but if you ever find yourself out there, you should definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Let down. I have gone to this location before and it was good. Not this time. I ordered 2 medium Italian subs, both about $10.00 a piece. When we went to eat them they only had 4 slices each of ham and salami. Will not be returning again, sorry."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for 5 days on business and had a hard time finding good restaurants, reasonably priced around town.  The sandwiches are fresh, tasty and plenty of vegetarian options.  Service was friendly and helpful.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We stumbled in here one day when the restaurant we were originally going to was closed... LOVE this place!  My favorite is the italian sausage sandwich with marinara, hot peppers and mushrooms!  The phili cheese steak, meatball and others are also great.  We go here all the time now that we discovered it!"}
{"text":"As usual all ways awesome.  Bobbie, cheese steak or turkey is the way to go. Can't go wrong with any of those choices. If you have a few people that all want the same go with a large. It will be more than enough for three people."}
{"text":"Great staff, great food! It's a sandwich shop, not much to complain about. Clean, generous, and nice! Got the cheese steak and it was tastyyyyy. Highly suggest for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"They were out of hoagie rolls, but we came in 30 before closing. Had Kaiser instead. Got the chicken cheese steak. Amazing sandwich. The cashier Anastasia is incredibly nice. You're gonna love it. Get the spicy peppers."}
{"text":"I was wrong. It was a good idea to come to Capriotti's twice in one day. I'm ashamed, but it was delicious. If you had told me that cranberry sauce on a sandwich was a good idea, I would have hit you--turns out that was wrong as well. Delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered the capastrami sandwich, which is  a hot pastrami sandwich with cold coleslaw. The bun was soft and fresh. Overall, a tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing cheesesteak.

One mile from my home is Corleone's. About 15-20 minutes from my home is Capriotti's. I never go to Corleone's. I go to Capriotti's all the time.

The workers here are nice and the cheesesteak is terrific. The large is 20\" I believe, so if you're ordering for yourself and in no mood to eat until you have a stroke, get the medium. Also, try it with the hot peppers. It adds the slightest bit of spice without becoming too overwhelming.

That's really all I can say about this place. Wonderful cheesesteak. I haven't tried anything else because the cheesesteak is too good to pass up when I make the drive down there. The patrons rave about the other sandwiches, though, so I absolutely would not be afraid to try something else. There's maybe 5 or 6 tables inside and 2 outside? so be prepared to order to go if you arrive at prime dine-in lunch/dinner hours.

Do yourself a favor and go to Capriotti's. Help this place attain the reviews and ratings it deserves. The fact that there's only 8 reviews is criminal. I understand it is in the heart of the suburbs, but it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Some of the best hot subs in Vegas.  No matter what you decide on it's always the way you want it.  The only difference in visiting one location than another is the seating area.   Service is always fast and staff comes off as genuinely kind and welcoming.  It's no surprise they make best of Vegas every year.  Always a weekly stop for lunch and will always be a suggested to somebody that crazily enough may not have eaten here before."}
{"text":"If you want an awesome cheese steak sandwich that will top all the one's you've had, go there NOW.  If you're on the strip, get a cab.  Totally worth it."}
{"text":"This place is by far my FAVORITE sandwich shop!! My husband and I saw the billboard for it and we are always looking for new places to try out.  We stopped in for our first visit and ate there, other two visits we ordered online and just picked it up.   Super easy and our orders are usually ready for pick up in 10 - 15 mins after submitting our order. The inside is pretty small and the chairs are uncomfortable, but its not intended for long stays anyways, its a sub shop.  I had the slawbejoe and my husband had the cheesesteak.  I am very picky about my slaw so I was a little nervous ordering this, but it is so good that we have gone back three different times now with the intention of trying different items and I keep getting the slawbejoe! The slaw was perfect (in my book!) it was juicy, sweet and tangy, fresh and crispy.  The meat was tender and fresh as well.  Bread...FRESH!!  My husband thought his cheesesteak was just o.k. (granted he asked for no mushrooms and no peppers, that my friend's is no cheesesteak! ;)  lol).  The second time around he ordered the Italian and talked about how awesome it was the whole time eating it, so did my sister in law.  I plan on trying the Bobbie next time around...if I can talk myself out of the slawbejoe!   I love the sandwiches!!  If you haven't been to Capriotti's, get your butt in there and eat a sub!!"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest fan of cranberries, so I've never tried the Bobbie. However, the cheese steak has exactly the right touch of melty, gooey cheesiness.  Try the mushroom cheese steak with sweet peppers, yum. Service and decor could be nicer, but you'll forget about that right after your first bite."}
{"text":"The employees are rude.  I admit we were not in the right place to order but they did see us and said nothing to help us out until another person came up. So we left to Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"Great late night. Got sandwiches from here multiple times as a local! So happy to live close to this 24 hour spot. Peyton and bob Dylan are fire"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! Had the Bobbie and it was amazing! Best little sandwhich shop in AZ."}
{"text":"The one by South Point was that I first I found & assume each is just as good since its cookie cutter.  LOVED the food.

Didn't get to order here because they wouldn't let me use the restroom first.  

People are eating everywhere inside on tables and chairs and outside on the table and chairs so its obviously not a take out only establishment.  

POOR POLICY.  Its not like its a store where I can steal in there?"}
{"text":"This is the sub place to come to in Vegas!!! Just received excellent customer service from Cat... She knows how to talk to customers... Thank you"}
{"text":"Awesome Sandwiches!! When we lived in Vegas we used to eat here  2- 3x a week. Then we moved to Salt Lake City, Utah and they don't have one here which stinks.  We have been visiting Phoenix often and we were so excited to see that Capriottis is just 10 minutes away. We eat here at least once a week when we visit."}
{"text":"My wife was really craving this place since we got into town. She was not dissapointed. The Capstrami was great!!! I had the turkey & ham with cranberry sauce, WOW!!!! It was Supergood! This place gets busy, So you may have to wait 10 to 15 sometimes.We ordered about 7 sandwiches for our family. But It was sooooooo worth it!"}
{"text":"We love Capriotti's! My husband and I love the Bobby, but my kids are fans of the meatball.  It can be a bit pricey for our large family of 7 to each have their own sub, so we buy 3 large (20 inch) subs to split.  It's plenty of food and we are all able to try a taste of several different sandwiches instead of being limited to one.  Definitely one of the best sub restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"If there was a negative star option, then I would say -5 !! I really liked the \"Bobbie sandwich\" so one day I go there and order that sandwich and halfway through the sandwich I bit hard into something hard like a rock. It was so hard THAT I CRACKED MY TOOTH ON IT!!
I had surgery on my mouth in the past, so after I took that bite, that was it for my tooth so I had to go see my dentist once again. SMH and I told the guys working there and all they did was say sorry and offer me a free sandwich card...
The worst part was, that it was MY BDAY!....Yea i could go on all day, but I'll just stop here and warn people to avoid that place and sandwich if you care about yourself..."}
{"text":"I had the chicken cheesesteak w provolone, russian dressing, and slaw.  Gooey yumminess.  Totally worth the walk from hell I had in 110 degree weather.  Cheap too -- under $10 for a twelve inch sandwich overflowing with filling and a bottle of water."}
{"text":"When I got my sandwich is was very poorly made and everything was falling out of it. After a few bites I pulled a hair out of it. I ignored it and continued to eat the other half of the sandwich. I pulled 2 more hairs out of the other half so I decided to take the sandwich back. When I explained the situation, the employees were very nice and offered to make me a new sandwich. While I was waiting the owner or manager named Michael confronted me and was very rude and aggressive. He implied that I was lying about the hairs and asked me to show him the hairs. Obviously I didn't keep them. So he rolled his eyes at me and gave me very dirty looks until I left. Apart from the friendly employees this place is not worth going to. The food is just ok and if you have any complaints expect to be verbally attacked."}
{"text":"This is one of my fav sandwich places. The first time I went I had a club sandwich and loved it. Since hen I get the cheese steak and wow is it ever good....my mouth is watering! My husband loves it as well. He tried the Bobby which is what they are famous for, and although he liked it he likes the cheese steak better. The bread is SO fresh and meats cooked on site. Wish we had one of these in Canada!"}
{"text":"My least favorite Capriotti's. Bread is usually stale, customer service is lacking, orders get wrong and it is almost always filthy. I live around the corner but usually prefer the Capriotti's on Silverado Ranch and LV Blvd."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the turkey sandwich. Best turkey around. Certainly their specialty."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Made my sandwich with no bread. A special request came out perfect.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with service!!! I've been in there a couple of times, love the food, but the little jerks they hired are horrible. Brad to be exact, was more interested in trying to sell me every desert then getting my order right. I would to love support Capriotti's Phoenix but not if i'm going to spend my hard earned money on something i didnt order and bad service!"}
{"text":"All sandwich's are awesome and a must stop any time I am in the area.  My favorites are the bobbie or the philly cheese steak.  Staff is great too"}
{"text":"Best sandwich in town.  Love the cheesesteak or bobbie.  Either way works for me."}
{"text":"The bobbie was good but the cashier with the chipped tooth made me never want to come back.  I ordered a supermonk IPA, which is a San Tan Beer.  The girl tried to charge me for an Import price.  I was like \"That's a domestic, it says San Tan on the beer... like San Tan Village you know?\"

She goes \"I don't know what your talking about\"

I said \"Oh well there is a mall and a whole community called San Tan, it's right near Chandler\"

She says \"Yeah, I don't really care.\"


This girl shuts me down for trying give her information that is specifically HER JOB to know.  I've never encountered a capriotti's cashier that was this ignorant and mean in my life and I've been going to caps for years.  I will not go into this one ever again if I see that woman behind the register."}
{"text":"This Place is Horrible sev is bad I would nvr order from here asked for something on the board snitch said they were out and had the nerve to catch a attitude when I said something about it told me to leave even if it it close does not mean the sev is good I will nvr go to this place again I sug that nobody goes here and I'm going to speak to my friends which they come and there are a lot of them and tell them to nvr come again I have nvr been anywhere in lv and been treated that way and will not do that"}
{"text":"Let me say how excited I was when I heard this location was going to open. My husband and I love their sandwiches and decided to stop in for dinner about quarter to 7. Therefore it was quite busy, we place our order and took our seats amongst the crowd of people. It took a little longer than expected, so once we noticed people that ordered after us got there food we spoke up. Once they realized they accidentally skipped us they immediately apologized and worked hard to make our food as soon as possible. You could tell they were training people because it is such a new location, Because of the inconvenience they offered us more than enough compensation. It was a simple mistake but we are very pleased with how the workers handled the issue."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are amazing but the employees suck. This is very unfortunate. The sandwiches aren't worth poor customer service in my eyes."}
{"text":"Capastrami! I'm not much of a sandwich eater since I stay away from bread, but this was worth every delicious, meaty, juicy, gluten calorie! My BF got the cheesesteak and loved it too. Will definitely be back! Coincidentally, this CVS strip center now has THREE of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. Stay somewhere close to here and you won't even have to go to the Strip."}
{"text":"Always delicious! Great portion, even the small is huge! The capastrami is sooo good!
I used to be a huge fan of the Bobbie. Thanksgiving on a sub! But even just there ham and cheese is delicious. Add on their delicious Sweet Peppers!

Staff is always friendly and eager to give tips on new sandwhich ideas. Most are young employees, so sometimes I catch some coversations that make me chuckle. But I love this place, and highly reccomend it!"}
{"text":"We've been to many Capriotti's but never this location.  Will never go back either.  Ordered a Tuna Sub and an Italian Sub.  However, when we got our subs they were more like condiment  subs.  They were saturated with mustard, mayo and oil and vinegar and I probably had maybe 1 tablespoon of Tuna on my 9' sandwich with very little fillers.  Bread was soggy as soon as we opened the paper and we ate it there!  Can you imagine if we ordered it to go? If we hadn't been in a hurry to catch a flight, I would have given the sandwiches back but too late.  Not to mention, we asked for a cup for water and they gave us a tiny bathroom dixie cup.  Really?  I have to say it was the worst Capriotti's sandwich I ever had.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The Bobbi is delicious.  The cranberry sauce was fresh, and the stuffing is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Walked in and asked what the favorite sandwich is. She said italian, and I said sounds great. 12\" sub on really great bread, tasty meats all the fixings, I don't think I could eat the whole sandwich it was filling. I are half and it was perfect. Very friendly staff, like walking into Cheers where everybody knows your name."}
{"text":"TL;DR Fresh, Excellent Food, no processed deli meats, nice friendly staff and service. Uses Belly Rewards. Good value for $

Service: I've always been greeted by a smile and staff is polite and positive. I've never had to wait too long for my order to be prepped. The staff is knowledgeable about their product and will make recommendations for toppings. 

Atmosphere: The place is clean (i haven't seen the bathrooms) and organized. I've also never dined in, always carry out. The seating is minimal, but comparable to competitor sandwich shops in the vicinity. Bonus, Capriotti's has a TV tuned into news or sports, which is a step up from it's competitors.

Food: I've had the Bobbie, the chicken cheesesteak, beef cheesesteak, and Cole Turkey.
I've always found the food to be fresh, tasty, and well combined. Let's be clear, don't come to Capriotti's if you are on a diet or don't do 'the fixin's. Capriotti's sandwiches aren't an assembly line product like most chain stores. They are works of gastronomic art. In order to understand and taste the full effect of the art, you don't mess with the product. Get the slaw, get the onions, peppers, and mushrooms, and get the dressings. Not choosing to do so is comparable to viewing Van Gogh's 'Starry Night' without any of the yellow pigments. It's nice, but not nearly as awe inspiring as experiencing it as the artist designed it to be. 

Major bonus points for using non processed deli meats. 'Real' roasted turkey and beef make a big difference. Listen, when I was pregnant and craving roast beef sandwiches, this is where I'd head. (FYI, you aren't supposed to eat  processed 'deli' meat when preggo. Just in case you didn't know). The meat makes a world of difference. Every time I take a cheese steak back to work, I have at least 4 people drift to my desk asking me what that delectable smell is. So at the very least, you can be the envy of the office lunch crowd. 

Cons: The calorie count. If I was a lucky person who could eat whatever I want and not gain an ounce, I'd be there every day. But, because you really need all the fixin's to truly enjoy the food, it's a 'once in awhile'' treat for me. While they do offer lower calorie options, let's be real, the reason you go here is for Thanksgiving in a sandwich or a delicious, greasy, cheesy cheesesteak. 

Pros: Good value for the money spent, at least in my opinion. The small is a 9\" and I've never gotten a larger size. For $7-8 at most assembly line chain stores, you get a 6' sandwich with 4 thin slices of processed deli meats. Not so at Cappriotti's. That thing is piled high with meat and fixin's. I always just get a small sandwich and it's more than satisfying and filling. 
Rewards Program - this location uses Belly Rewards. If you aren't familiar, it's a loyalty program that a lot of smaller businesses use. I use my Belly Rewards at a lot of places I frequent and it pays off: I've gotten free scones, free coffee upgrades, free massage upgrades, and free sides. 

Now if you'll excuse me, I have a cheesesteak with sweet and spicy peppers, onions, and mushrooms sitting here calling my name."}
{"text":"I love the meatball sandwich! Mmm, my fave! And always staffed with friendly people that get you your food quickly! And the bread is great!"}
{"text":"I love these sandwiches but WHY OH WHY do you take 10X longer than any other cap????? I go when there's hardly a line and whoooaaa the wait."}
{"text":"Still my absolute favorite sandwich shop in AZ!  We came here again 2 nights ago and the employees were super helpful and friendly.  We had Capriottis cater a business event a few months ago and it was absolutely perfect!  Everything was just as good as if we had been in the store getting it ourselves.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"man i just came from work an stop by an got me a mushroom an beef with cheese... omg sooo good... with chips an drink to wash it down... i didn't take a breather just scarfed it...  u'll love it!!"}
{"text":"I love Capriottis anywhere but this place is close to home and always has prompt service and delicious sandwiches."}
{"text":"I went to capriottes right before it closed and ordered a 12 inch sub they purposely gave me a 9 inch like wtf man I expect employees to be more professional then that. The food is good but the service is shitty if I could give capriottis 0 stars I would"}
{"text":"Our group went here based on Yelp reviews, and we all thought it was good -- but definitely not great.   There was only one other customer there during our visit... which makes me wonder if some of the reviews aren't legit.   The restaurant was very clean, and the staff was friendly.   The sandwiches were huge -- but nothing special.   We all wished our bread had been toasted, and really wished they had a drink machine instead of just bottled soft drinks."}
{"text":"You know what I hate about this place?

It's that they ALWAYS forget to not put mayonaise on my sandwiches when I ask them not to, so I call the corporate office to try and get a giftcard since I have bought about 10 20\" sandwiches, all with mayo with on them, and the lady I get on the phone basically just laughs at me, makes fun of me for being upset, and low and behold no giftcard.

NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL CUSTOMER APPRECIATION!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best in town! And as Donald Trump would say... \"HUGE\"! Consistently good and tons of flavor. The sandwich's they serve are unique and delicious!"}
{"text":"Jason the Employee has the worst customer service I have ever seen, he gives me a chicken cheese steak instead of a cheesesteak I get home call him and tell him and he gives me a credit for a sandwich, I call him a week later and he says I'm not on the credit list, so he basically did not put me on the credit list, then I have to go all the way home for my receipt because he did not do his job right twice, he has a very bad attitude and won't let the customer speak Forget About It"}
{"text":"One word...YUM.  Their turkey sandwiches in any form are to die for.  My friend always gets the Capastrami, and she won't order anything else.  Sometimes they also have little Nothing Bundt Cakes for sale at the counter, a sure fire way to get rid of your sweet tooth!  MMM"}
{"text":"Seriously, sweep a floor and wipe off a table once in a while. This dining area is disgusting right now. Not a single clean table and crap all over the floor. I understand lunch rush, but it's 3:30 on a Thursday, I'm the only one here. Normally if I walk in and see this big a mess front of house I turn and walk out because I can only imagine what back of house looks like. Sandwich was good and service was friendly but please take a look at your dining area after lunch."}
{"text":"When in Vegas or anywhere else these places exist, go. I am a big fan of the meetball, the capastrami, and the Cole turkey. I have not tried the other sandwiches, but the ones I have tried have never disappointed. Plus the large is as big as your arm if your arm is 20 inches long. Go there. Do it now or regret it later. 

Tip:  there is often a wait here and it is well worth it so don't be a whiny jerk off if you have to wait."}
{"text":"Every sandwich is good here.  I have never heard a bad comment about a sandwich made at Capriotti's by friends or family.  I had the cheesesteak with hot peppers.  I can honestly say it rivals the cheesesteak I had when I was in Philly visiting family.  This is the best cheesesteak in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Called and placed an order to be picked up. My husband goes to pick up and they never made the sandwich. They said that they never got the order over the phone. Boooooo"}
{"text":"I am sure everyone has heard of Capriotti's but I have to add my two cents. Their sandwiches are so good, and a nice alternative to the chain sub shops. My personal favorite is the Bobbie, while my boyfriend always goes for the capistrami with double meat (ugh, why?). But here is my question, why are all of the staff beautiful young boys?! I have only seen one girl ever behind the counter at Capriotti's. The rest are these cute young things with a knack for making great subs, and girls sweat while they wait! I am in love and completely happy, but I am always begging my boy to go to Capriotti's. I think he is starting to catch on, but I don't care. Girls, Capriotti's has awesome sandwiches, and awesome eye candy while you wait...what could be better for lunch? (Caution: order in advance by phone, or you could get stuck waiting a bit...actually, this could be a good thing!)

Recommended sandwich: The Bobbie for a Thanksgiving-leftover-style sub."}
{"text":"After coming back and getting better service from a  girl named Morgan I'll keep coming back. Must of been an off day for the crew. Still my favorite spot!!"}
{"text":"I might move back home just to eat Capastramis on a regular basis. 

Picture a hot pastrami sandwich with provolone and some kind of insane Russian dressing. Hot? Yes. Add orange creme soda and voila!"}
{"text":"Best food in Las Vegas! Best Sandwiches I ever ate! Capastrami is the best warm sub, The Bobbie is the best cold sub. Do it!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this shop lots of times and to have Anthony the manager go above and beyond to make sure my Sandwich was prepared correctly was priceless! I was greeted and felt like I was in my moms kitchen from start to finish of my order! My Sandwich was a Amazing!"}
{"text":"Oh yes I am a fan!!!
Great to grab on your way to the airport for a snack on the plane!
Service was solid and fast. 
I had the Bobbie and my mom ordered the Capastrami. Check out the menu online!
Both were delish and the bread...oh sweet baby jesus it was crusty chewy and hearty enough to handle all the fixin inside!
We dont have a Capriotti's in our neck of the woods so I look forward to going back.

winnah winnah chicken dinnah (shaking my shakka in the air)"}
{"text":"There aren't nearly as many good sandwich shops in Vegas as there should be, but Capriotti's is pretty good.  I like most of their sandwiches, and the prices aren't ridiculous."}
{"text":"What took me so long to finally try Capriotti's?  I'm not sure why it took so long for our paths to cross, but as fate would have it, we had an office Thanksgiving party and I was fortunate enough to meet the Veggie Turkey.

For Capriotti's in general:

I am highly addicted to Capriotti's at the moment.  Which is odd because I'm not usually a sandwich type of girl nor do I particularly care for fake meat.  Something about this particular sandwich, however, has me got hooked.

The bread has a nice little crust on the outside while still being soft and chewy.  The toppings are always fresh.  There is a perfect balance of ingredients- not too much lettuce (like most places will do) and not too skimpy on the \"meat\" and cheese.  The sweet peppers?  They have opened me up to a whole new sandwich experience.  I l-o-v-e me some sweet peppers.

The employees are super friendly and I can't recall any problems with any of my orders.  Plus you can sometimes get $3 off your next order if you get a survey on your receipt!

I've also had theVveggie Cheesesteak and it really wasn't for me- too much fake meat.  It tasted fine I just couldn't handle that much fake chicken.  I think it would be a really good sandwich for someone who is a newbie vegetarian.

My only gripe with Capriotti's is that they don't offer free water.  I think it should be required that every restaurant has free water for their customers, but unfortunately that's not the case.  I really, really hate paying for an overpriced bottle of water.

For this particular location:

The employees are great and they are pretty fast with my order.  The store can get pretty messy though and there aren't a lot of places to sit down and eat your sandwich.  It's probably best to just pick it up from here and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's in general, and you can find what I have to say about them here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/capriottis-sandwich-shop-las-vegas#hrid:L4A9oqiJjf3XwTohxPdN4A/src:self

For this location in particular... I wasn't too fond of it.  We happened to be in the area and stopped for a quick dinner.  The employees weren't the friendliest, there are three tables to sit at, and the store seemed like it could use a good scrub (floors especially).  Bonus points for fountain drinks and free water."}
{"text":"If you happen to find yourself at the food court in Aliante Station, I would suggest you save yourself the hassle and skip Capriotti's.

I hate to say it because I really like Capriotti's (see my review here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/capriottis-sandwich-shop-las-vegas?q=nicole) and because this location is the closest to my house.  But I have had too many problems here that I have now decided I will either drive further if I need my sandwich fix or find somewhere else to eat.

Of the four times I have eaten at this location, I have had problems during three of them.

1.  We had a 30 minute wait for 2 sandwiches.
2.  We ordered two medium sandwiches but when we got home we realized that one was clearly a small.
3.  We ordered one small and one medium sandwich but were charged for two mediums.  The employee noticed his mistake after charging our card and said there was nothing he could do except offer us a bag of chips (which we don't eat).  Also, my husband's Veg Cole Turkey was very skimped on toppings.

It's a good thing I know how good the customer service and quality of food is at the other locations.  Otherwise, if this was my only experience I'm not sure I'd bother with a Capriotti's again.

Located in the Aliante Station food court next to the movie theater.  Note: They do not sell large-sized sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place isn't too bad...it's just your average day to day sandwich shop...they do have a great variety of different sandwiches you can get (better than subway and port of subs) the only thing that bothered me the last time I was there was my bread on my sandwich was really soggy.. It was pretty gross that i couldn't even eat it...i took it back & they made me a fresh 1 without being douche bags about it so i thought that was pretty cool.."}
{"text":"Odd sandwich configurations. Coals law and roast beef. Yuck! Roast beef was dry.  No basic choices on the menu. No calorie counts either. Not many customers either."}
{"text":"Decent sandwiches. They are definitely more hype then I would give them. Foods not bad not amazing either."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? Seriously, this is the best sandwich shop ever. Whenever I'm in Vegas this is must. Not only are the portions GYNORMOUS, but the price is cheap. I usually walk off the strip to this location and it is shady, so I would not recommend doing that at night. It is so good, that whenever I am in Vegas, I try to get a room with a fridge so that I can stock up. Please bring this shop to Chicago. If I were to ever own a franchise, this would be it."}
{"text":"As good as it gets! The Capastrami is my ultimate favorite. Super tasty and pretty much the best sandwich here in Vegas."}
{"text":"The service was so friendly and food came quickly even though they were in the middle of a lunch rush.  The sandwich tasted great the ingredients were fresh. It was perfectly heated. Actually this was the first time I had eaten there and we will certainly return."}
{"text":"I can't believe this place got so many good reviews....I was very disappointed in Capriottis. There sandwiches did not impress me at all, like where did all the flavor go?! To top off my disappointing  meal no restrooms. What kind of restaurant doesn't have a bathroom for there patrons to use C'mon!? I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Capriotti's. I never really liked to eat sandwiches but after eating here I am officially a sandwich fanatic!!! I eat here about once a week and order something new each time. My favorite is the Philly Cheese steak with grilled onions (Soooo good). It truly is as good as it gets! Perfection."}
{"text":"There really is nothing you can find to complain about here. Excellent tastes, plenty of meat, cheese, or whatever other accoutrements come on the sandwich. Great value and plenty of food. 

The Bobbie is one of the more unique sandwiches I've ever tried. With stuffing, pulled turkey, and cranberry sauce; it presents a sweet and salty taste that has great balance.

The meatballs are excellent as well. Not dry, but very moist and loaded with tasty marinara. I would also highly recommend the grilled italian, as it contains many different but complementary flavors with the Italian meats, cheese, and hot peppers. Overall a great place to go."}
{"text":"I really love Capriotti's Sandwich Shop I was extremely disappointed and disenchanted with this place on Southern Highlands Parkway it was by far my worst experience at Capriotti's ever ,they seem to mess up every single sandwich on our order, except for one or two , my mother can't have hot peppers and they put so many hot peppers on her sandwich, it burned her throat ,I asked for a capastrami and they put double hot peppers and no coleslaw ..... Also there was absolutely no clear writing on any of the sandwiches to notate Which sandwich was which...... There were a couple of indiscernible scribbles on one of the sandwiches, when I asked the people working there which sandwich was which the guy who made them came out and barked at my family to just open it up and figure it out.... Never coming back here again and never suggesting this particular location to anyone I know!"}
{"text":"Really nice, tried it cause of the yelp reviews and i don't regret it. Good price for how much food you get :)"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich excellent friendly service and fast. Love going here. The Bobbie is to die for. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Terrible service. 
Ordered online, arrived there ten minutes after scheduled pick up time, waited in line to find out they had not even started my order. I was told to wait five minutes, proceeded to watch every one from the line get their food before me. The estimated 5 minute wait time became thirty minutes no exaggeration. Wasn't even offered as much as a water cup for the wait. 

Took an hour to make two subs (which still were made incorrectly).

The simplicity of making a sandwich in a timely manner should come easy to a franchise corporation. 
I literally downloaded yelp to make this my first review out of dissatisfaction. Thanks for making me and my pregnant wife miss our movie date."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time the other day. When I walked in I was overwhelmed by the spell of deep fryer grease. That smell actually stuck to me for an hour afterwords. The whole place didn't seem too clean and the table that I was sitting at was sticky. If I had had more time for my lunch I would've went somewhere else. So I did give this place two stars because the sandwich wasn't half bad. But I do feel it was still a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great, you get your money's worth, a lot of these sandwich shops will pile on the lettuce and very little meat, Not here, so refreshing to finding a good place like this!!"}
{"text":"Seriously, they never have a full rack of chips. Kills it. Some people like having certain flavors together. It's enough for me to go to a different Capriotti's, especially every time I go, they don't have my chip. Sitting in here right now and I see a clear view of the back... Tons of boxes of chips!!! Someone there needs to jump on inventory control... ASAP! (Asked a staff member, she said they didn't have my chip)... Bummer. Just can't see this being accidental, having been through this before. I'll go to the rainbow location for now on. Worth the extra 10 mins.  Yes!!! And this all because of CHIPS! Haha"}
{"text":"I think this is the best Capriotti's in town great service and the sandwiches are always good feels like a restaurant and not just a sandwich shop"}
{"text":"I always get the vegetarian cheese steak (even though meat lovers would say there's no such thing as vegetarian cheese steak). Hot and totally delicious! The wait might be long during lunch, but I usually call ahead and get a take out. They also have a punch card that gets you the 10th sandwich free. Awesome sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich. Had the phillycheese both times that I visited this place. Good service. Great sandwich ... Good portion of meat, cheese and veggies!"}
{"text":"As good as always!! Capriotti's is definitely another good reason to come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I have to say first that I love Capriotti's. The sandwiches are delicious and the options are terrific.

However, this location's service has been poor to put it nicely. I let it slide the first time as a fluke, but the second time was nearly the same experience. The first time I called in an order shortly after 11 to beat the main lunch rush. When I arrived, they weren't exceptionally busy, but there were a few people there. I let them know I was there to pick up my order and I paid and started waiting. My bag was ready with 3 sandwiches and I was just waiting on one more. I literally waited 20 minutes for that last sandwich. I was asked several times what I was waiting for and I let them know, but that did not help.

The second time I decided to avoid the call-in debacle, so I ordered three sandwiches and brought two friends along to order 2 more each (we were picking up for our office). We were one of three orders they had to make at the time, so again, they were not slammed by any means. After a few minutes, my friends received their orders, but mine was waiting on ONE sandwich. I was asked again what I was waiting on and then informed them. Several minutes later and after 5 other groups got their orders, my sandwich was ready. I proceeded to the register and was ready to pay when they handed a call-in order to the person behind me and asked me to step aside so that they could pay.

What a slap in the face, I'll never return to this location."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Capriotti's and it was amazing! I went with my sister last weekend while we were shopping and it was perfect. We were greeted right away by the friendly cashier and ordered our food. There were plenty of tables open, but if it was really busy you might have issues finding seating. I ordered the small italian with hot peppers added onto it. It was so tasty and so fresh. Everything from the bread to the meat and cheese and veggies were perfect. I ordered chips and a drink on the side and I had the other half of my sandwich to take home. One of the workers saw we were done and came by to give us to go boxes without us having to ask. All in all, it was a great trip in and out and I highly recommend the italian. It blows all other sandwiches from anywhere else away!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were having a hard work day, and I decided to head over to Capriotti's on Ft. Apache, before we missed lunch all together.

I was having a Bobbie; she wanted me to pick up Turkey and Provolone, lettuce - no onions, no tomato, no oil and vinegar, no salt and pepper. She's almost a complete vegetarian; never eats red meat.

When we opened the sandwiches at home, mine was correct. Hers was labeled as an Italian sandwich on the receipt (with provolone specified). It was chock full of nothing but red meat... including pepperoni, ham, and one other. She was ticked off and decided to head over to exchange or return the sandwich for refund.

The manager, on the register, was the same person who took my order. She insisted that's what I ordered. My girlfriend's response... \"I didn't sent some flunky to pick up a sandwich, he knows me more than 10 years. He knows I don't eat red meat and would never order it for me. A refund ensued.

The manager made a parting dig. \"You got your refund, you should be happy.\"

Not really... a simple sandwich order had been made. Deferring lunch at that point was not a 'happy moment'.

Low point in a usually favorable experience with ANY Capriotti's location."}
{"text":"Best sub shop in Vegas, hands down. Not up! DOWN! The Bobby sub is Thanksgiving in your mouth, but without the family drama. It really doesn't get better than that sub. I wish I stayed longer to enjoy more sandwiches. I visited the shop three times while in Vegas and ordered the twenty-inch Bobby three times. I asked them to cut it in thirds which was no trouble at all for them. Breakfast, lunch, and dinner all in one stop. I will always visit them again. They do take orders online or over the phone."}
{"text":"I am a huge Capriotti's fan but after a complete change of crew at providence I am taking my business elsewhere. I buy 3 sandwiches every Friday at providence location, a place that used to be worth going out of my way 4. Cue complete change of crew and now a month of inconsistent sandwiches that are just wrong. Today I am done and will chose another location. First couldn't call in as apparently they left the phone off the hook. Then my medium slaw-be-joe came with literally one drop of Russian dressing. I couldn't eat a quarter of the sandwich as it was so dry (sans mayonnaise as well). This crew is not worth my \"beer money\" and they should be ashamed to carryon the previous crews tradition."}
{"text":"Prompt, friendly service and varied (but not too extensive) menu. Perfect for delicious sandwiches on fresh bread with fresh ingredients. Their home-roasted turkey and their homemade meatballs were delicious. AND the protein shakes taste like milkshakes. Heaven. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"In the very great and wise words of my father \"Holy Crap That's Good!\". There is no wiser sentence that can describe how amazing this place is! One of my dear friends took me to this place that he knew about. It apparently is the \"IT\" place to go in Vegas. I had my doubts. 
We drove up to the place and it looked a little dumpy (apparently this is a sign of a great place to eat). There wasn't much on the wall except for a menu with about 30 different subs. I allowed my friend to order for me since it seemed like he knew what the best thing to get was. He ordered a turkey sub on wheat with slaw and extra Russian. 
The kids behind the counter couldn't have been much older then 17 and reminded me of every single person in my graduating class. Helpful and pleasant enough to not get fired. When they were done making my sandwich I swear it was the biggest \"medium\" sub I had ever seen. 
When I took my first bite it was to die for! It was not a sandwich for the dainty. The sandwich got all over the place and was the best sandwich I had ever eaten! I had never eaten a sandwich with Cole slaw on it, but it is something to be tried. 
I declare that everyone needs to eat here!"}
{"text":"Tuna sandwich was a great value.  Wish they had gluten-free bread.  TV is a nice touch when a football game is on or something."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice. 
The first time was during a very busy lunchtime and the Tuna sandwich I had was pretty good.  It was a little hard to manuever around the tightly placed tables and chairs but that was about the only thing I had an issue with the first time.  

The second time I went with my daughter in the late afternoon when there was no-one else in the restaurant except a group of men who worked for Capriotti's who were having a business meeting at one of the tables.  When I ordered and paid for my meal I gave the cashier my money and watched as she LICKED HER INDEX FINGER and proceeded to take money out of the drawer and hand it to me as my change.  I was so disgusted and asked her \"did you just lick your finger and then put use it to pull out the dollar that you just gave me\"?  She shrugged and said \"yeah\".  I told her that it was gross and I didn't appreciate having her spit on the money that I was putting back into my wallet.  She just shrugged again.  Well I know money is dirty and all and who knows where the money has been that I already have in my wallet so oh wel...BUT THEN I watched her stick that SAME FINGER into the inside of my drink cup as she handed it to me.  I just looked at her and said\" this is unbelievable\".  I didn't bother saying anymore to her because I had a feeling she would just shrug again.  Well then I was really grossed out and just couldn't stomach filling my drink cup after she stuck her spitty finger in it so I was standing at the drink machine trying to decide what to do when one of the men from the meeting stood up and walked past me.  As he walked by I asked him if he worked there and he said \"yes, do you need something\"?  I said yes I need a new cup  because the cashier licked her finger to slide a  dollar bill out of the drawer then stuck that same finger inside my cup to hand it to me.  His reaction to this?  \"ok, let me get you another cup.  Not \"I'm sorry maam that is not the way we train our employees\" or any other sort of apology or \"I will discuss this with the employee and make sure it doesn't happen in the future\"....nope he just handed me another cup and said \"here you go\".  Well I guess I could have pushed for an apology or something but I was just too disgusted to speak and decided that I just would never return to Capriotti's again.  

Just thought some of you out there would like to know what my experience was.
I gave them two stars because the Tuna sandwich was actually pretty good, which is sad because I just can't bring myself to want to eat there again."}
{"text":"Normally love the place but today might be the last time I come to this location, absolutely HORRIBLE service!! The young girl with a Selena shirt doesn't greet and was too busy talking about her boyfriends then actually making sandwiches. She was so rude and shouldn't be allowed to work in customer service. Two other people walked in after me and they waited maybe 3/4mins before they were acknowledged. She didn't even charged me she asked her hardworking coworker to charge me. When I was waiting her other coworker asked how long someone had been on hold and she just shrugged her shoulders, she genuinely doesn't care about the paying customers walking into the sandwich shop and wasn't wearing a name tag (of course). I ended up waiting 30mins for 2 sandwich's and there was no one else in the place! Never again!"}
{"text":"Ive had the most popular bobby, I didnt like it. It has all the components I liked, excited, but it didnt taste good. I ate my boyfriends cheese steak instead with the added onion,  mushroom, and jalepano. It was tasty. They have three different sizes. They can come pretty large so perfect to share. We have over our many visit also tried the meatball sub but the best is still the philly. The staff is really nice, service was quick, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Service was great! Very friendly and helpful for being our first time.

The place was very clean and overall a nice experience. 

Unfortunately neither my wife or I enjoyed the sandwiches. Both of ours were really chewy, a first for me and I don't like chewy bread. 

Surprisingly with the oil and added seasoning the sandwiches still had no flavor to us but maybe we just have high expectations??

I notice their advertising states voted best sandwiches but not for us however I am sure others must like it."}
{"text":"Holy mofo! this spot is legit. The Bobbie is amazing. Feels like thanksgiving any day of the year."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch. We ordered a bobbie and cheese steak. My husband just got started when he pulled an extra long hair out of his mouth. It was so disgusting. The women preparing the food had no hair net or gloves. I consequently could not eat my sandwich anymore. Then they had the gall to only refund the price of my husband sandwich. So gross. Dirty place, dirty servers. Not recommende."}
{"text":"This place has awesome sandwiches!  I have tried the Capastrami, the Bobbie, the Slaw BeJo and the Cole Turkey.  My favorite so far is the CAPASTRAMI which is what I recommend you try first.  They're always friendly and greet everyone when they walk in and you can even get $3 off your order when you complete the online survey, which only takes a few minutes.  Overall...this place rocks and I'm goin to get some more Capastami soon!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good but for the price it's not that good...3 subs and 3 drinks for over $30???? I think I will stick with subway...this place isn't that good and when you order a cheese steak sandwich why do you have to add the veggies they normally come with and pay extra???? The owner needs to get a clue!!! You aren't that good to charge these inflated prices...bring them down a bit and see your clientele grow!!"}
{"text":"NASTY NASTY NASTY sandwich.  Pulled turkey on wheat.  I think our cat eats better food than this.  I don't know what all of the hype is about., but the sandwich I had was a waste of money.  The DRIEST turkey.  Seriously - like someone rolled the meat up in a paper towel and squeezed every last bit of moisture.  Oh, and the chick who made it looked like she was still wasted on something from the night before.  Ugh, that probably had something to do with it too.  I should just stick with Subway when I'm away from the yummy delis in the SF Bay."}
{"text":"Now I know what all the chatter is about. Why can't all sandwich places be like this?! Capriotti's is simply in a different league. Sure the price is a little higher (About $8 for 9\") and the wait a little longer, but this is due to the quality of ingredients and preparation. This spot in Town Square is fairly new and it was packed around 2 on a weekday. The seating area is limited, a few tables and a counter with bar stools facing the window.

On to the food itself...Let's begin with the bread. It is sooo soft and fresh. Just lightly toasted. It's still warm when you unwrap your sub, unlike other places that slop the meat on a cold bun and call it good. I went with the Italian Sausage sandwich with hot peppers and wow, flavor explosion! The meat is grilled to perfection and still very tender. One of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. I'll probably be a regular here."}
{"text":"Tucked into a strip mall, a quick walk across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel. Unique sandwich choices, great quality food. Even the \"small\" sandwich was filling. You order your sandwich & then pay for it at the register once they call your name."}
{"text":"Best Deli in Vegas.  The Veggie Turkey is outstanding.  They have made the veggie turkey out of soy and created a masterpiece of a sub.  Their most popular and best tasting sandwich is The Bobbie.  This is \"Thanksgiving in a bun\" as many others have stated.  Reminds me of eating at home the day after Thanksgiving.  

You will have to wait a bit longer than typical for the average deli.  Not only do they have a lot of customers during lunch but it takes the workers an extended amount of time to make one sandwich.  The combination of the two means that you will probably wait about 10 minutes for your sub.  Is it worth the wait?  Absolutely!

The small sandwich is 8\", the medium is 12\" and the large is 20\"."}
{"text":"1st time at this location. Service was great. Food was ready very quickly. What more can you say about \"The Bobby!\" Great sandwich!"}
{"text":"Good and fast service. Favorite sandwich place I love the chicken steak. Staff is always nice!"}
{"text":"These guys know how to make a real sub sandwich! Never heard of them until last week, one of my friends brought it up as a lunch idea for after our hike up Camelback. So glad we went! Every component in the sandwich was high quality and just delicious. I had the 9\" Italian with everything, plus crushed peppers for a little kick. I only put it down a couple times to clean my face off a little. The bread was delicious; nice and crispy on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside and the ingredients were piled high, just like I like it! With a Subway sandwich you get 70% bread and a little meat, which gets buried under the add-ons. Had no problem finding the meat and cheeses in this one; made up probably 40% of the whole sub! Definitely going to come back for more, whenever possible!"}
{"text":"We had Ham and Cheese with everything on it.  So far, this is my favorite Capriotti's. Yes I wished they put more tomato  , But I think it's Me loving tomatos.  Got the 20 inch and it was worth it.  Thanks"}
{"text":"Service was in Between Bad and Terrible.   Waited forever.  Where's the Veggies?   You can do better!"}
{"text":"My gameplan was to order the Bobbie and eat it. When a fellow Yelper became indecisive during the ordering process, I suggested we go halves on the Bobbie and Capastrami. All I gotta say is, best decision ever.

Little did I know the Capastrami was going to blow the Bobbie out of the water but it did. I have a high standard for pastrami, and this was some good stuff. Thinly sliced, with cole slaw and russian dressing, this sub destroys all subs I've had in recent memory. The bread is great too, nice and soft. 

Needless to say, the Bobbie was very good, it just took a back seat to the Capastrami real hard. Yes, you've heard that it is Thanksgiving dinner in sub form. I don't know about you guys, but I don't remember the liberal use of mayo at my Thanksgiving dinners. Nevertheless, the mayo doesn't necessarily hurt the sub, and I dig the sweet cranberry sauce mixing with it and the salty stuffing. To top it off, the turkey was tender and very good too. 

I just might have to swing through the LA location now."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. One of the best sandwich shops around. I recommend either the Bobbie, the Capastrami (my favorite), or a the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Went to pick up 5 sandwiches for a party on Saturday afternoon, owner was there and was quite rude. Sandwiches were just OK, all in all a bad experience and I won't return."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in town hands down I usually get the Italian sub but everything's the bomb it's worth the money huge sandwiches"}
{"text":"So I got a turkey sandwich a while back after going here many times before. I go to bite into it and low and behold a huge ass bone the size of the bread. I nearly cracked my teeth. Well after arguing with them and the management they went and gave me a whole free meal and made me happy. 

Well here we are 2 months down the line. I go in and order a large chicken cheese steak with onions and peppers sandwich to go. The woman behind the counter must not understand because I had to say it more then once. I go to work and open it up and its a steak cheese steak. I call the shop and tell them they messed up and they said they would send another one. 

I had to wait almost a hour for the sandwich to come in. I looked at what they sent me and instead of the large it was the medium. They said I would have to wait for them to send another one I refused and demanded they give me a refund. Let alone that the replacement they decided that even though it was not on the order to add mushrooms. Good thing I am not allergic.

This place has gone so far down hill it is crazy. I will be telling everyone I know and work with never to go back to this place ever again."}
{"text":"We are never disappointed when we come here.  We just shared the Capastrami...amazing!!! I'm working up the nerve to order the Bobby, I've heArd it's amazing, I'm just not a huge fan of cranberry. Capriotti's is a MUST when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"My second time to this location and impressed both times with staffs courteous attitude towards guests.  Love this place.  The staff keeps me coming back and the cleanliness is great!  Keep it up team and I hope you all get raises for appreciating your customers.   Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Should you find yourself on a vacation to Las vegas you must try Capriottis sandwich shop. It is a locals staple. They are located all over Vegas, and you must add it to your list of \"to-do's\" while there. I"}
{"text":"Last time food was cold and the sub wasn't even sliced in half.  12.00 for a med sub and a can of soda...yeah the sandwiches are tasty, but serioisly?"}
{"text":"Is it the best sandwich like they claim.... no. But it's definitely a step up over JJ or Subway. There is no need to get their largest size sub unless you plan to take it home for later."}
{"text":"I have been to this Capriottis MANY times, but I was SOOO disappointed with them this weekend.  My sandwich was so greasy it soaked through the bag onto my car seat.  The person that answered the phone sounded like I was bothering them and I ordered sweet peppers on the side, which the container's lid was not all the way on, so when I pulled them out of the bag (yes you guessed it, they were upside down), they spilled all over the floor.  Sad, sad, sad...."}
{"text":"Back again. Great place to grab a good priced $8.50 med (12'' though!) Capastrami sandwich! Second time here. Not disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Bobbie is thanksgiving any day of the year! The 20\" will fill 2-3 people for under $15 people. Winner winner turkey dinner"}
{"text":"I love the super size sandwiches.  You can get a 20 inch sub for under $15.  It can feed Two dudes or three girls or One super hungry dude. I forgot the name of the sub I got, but its turkey, cranberry, mash potatoes and stuffing.  It's taste like after thanksgiving."}
{"text":"If you want a great, big sandwich, this is the place to go! They are friendly, fast and the food is amazing! I recommend the slaw-b-joe and the capastrami."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm so excited to have found a really good veggie cheeseburger. I know right? A veggie burger at Capriottis? I was scratching my head too when I saw this on the menu. Didn't even know this was on there. But I'm thrilled that I got it because I've had veggie burgers at other places and none of it were as good as this one. What I loved so much about it was that it didnt fall apart so easily and it wasn't bland at all. I had Justin add some grilled onions, mushroom, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, and mayo and ketchup--all that in between the kaiser buns and it was veggie cheese burger heaven..yum. It was also pretty big for a small order so I saved the other half for later. Also a bonus: the price! It only cost 4.50! Plus the service was, as usual, awesome! One thing though that stil needs improvent was the cleanliness of the tables. It just needed to be wiped down more. There were crumbs and grease left over from previous patrons. Other than that, everything was gravy!"}
{"text":"Chris the cashier was very friendly and made sure orders were going out fast and good appreciate the great service and quality!!!"}
{"text":"Will never go to this store again. Walked in the staff ignored me then some guy walks in after me and they helped him right away. Horrid customer service, love the Bobby but Port of Subs down the street did me good. Do not recommend!!"}
{"text":"Walked into an empty shop and clearly heard everyone in the back groan. \"Oh, great.\"

Then one complained about the type of sandwich he had to make.

Thought about walking out but just worked 14 hours and was simply too tired and hungry. 

I don't have a lot of tolerance immature sarcastic **%@#+/?!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches at this location are consistently awesome. A bit pricey, but you get what you pay for. There is no bad sandwich in the place. Just ask yourself if you want a hot sandwich or a cold one? Big one or a small one? Then look at the ingredients and pick one. This one does not have soup, a couple locations do. Cookies are okay, chips are chips, drinks are drinks. This place is sandwich focused. A large cheese steak with hot and sweet peppers, onions, mushroom, mayo lettuce and tomato is the best thing in the place....by the way. It's actually two full meals in a bun. Unless you're a fatty like me.

Service is good, people are helpful and friendly. call ahead, place your order, then you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Consistently great sloppy sandwiches from this place. My usual......a super mega cheese steak with all the stuff....extra messy.....and mayo lettuce and tomatoes. Sounds funny on a cheese steak, but try it first. The Bobby a good choice too, but I don't stray too far too often. 

This location does not carry soup. Only really bad thing I got to say about that.

Place needs tables so kids can eat there too."}
{"text":"I like coming here for their Chicken Cheesesteak with hot peppers to make it extra spicy. A lot of people like their Bobby which is a turkey sub with cranberry and stuffing. This place really has a unique menu which I love. It keeps me coming back. My only complaint is that the staff are young, but I haven't had any issues with them. I wouldn't pay by credit card here since their machine seems sketchy. The place looks like it REALLY needs a GOOD cleaning maybe it's just old."}
{"text":"I like Capriotti sandwiches.  But my experience at this specific location was just not good.  I ordered a $17 cheesesteak sandwich with everything to go.  When I got home to share with my wife she opened the sandwich and there was nothing on the sandwich but cheese and steak.  No mushrooms, peppers, or anything.  It was very bland and certainly not worth $17.  I have ordered this same sandwich from other locations and it is always tasty.  

Next time they have a new opening instead of a person from the corporate office giving out balloon animals to children they should be in the back making sure the food is made correctly.  But I am glad to see other people have had good experiences at this location."}
{"text":"I had the worst service from one of the workers about not getting onions on my sandwich. I ordered online and specifically said no onions and the sub had them put on. I wouldn't have been so upset about it but when I went in to get my sandwich the worker made a sarcastic remark \"isn't there a button for no onions\" and this happened twice. I would not recommend this sub shop streets of New York way better and better customer service."}
{"text":"The bobby is great, I go to this place every time I'm staying at the embassy suites on Swenson"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop. Forget subway! My mouth waters right now just thinking about the bobbie sandwich. It's thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich. Yum! If your feeling tipsy throw a dollar in the tip jar and they will thank you in unison for the \"beer money\"."}
{"text":"All along the Las Vegas strip and beyond there's many choices available for potential diners. Capriotti's gives hungry sandwich searchers a haven filled with good eats at reasonable prices.

Their location is right off the strip and not terribly hard to get to. Parking is abundant.

The service was prompt and courteous.

The food, it was quite tasty. I mean, how can you go wrong with a Philly Cheesesteak? The bread was soft but crusty, the meat and fix'n's were all cooked to order.

The only downside to the shop is that it's on the small side. You won't be able to fit a large group in here, but if you get your sandwich to-go you won't have an issue with that."}
{"text":"Capriotti's sandwiches are AWESOME! So, I have to give 1 star because:

The music was on pretty loud while my wife and I were eating, and I got a phone call so I stepped out really quick. I was eating, and got another call, and stepped out again. I never complained about the music. Honestly not much of a complainer.... I received 2 phone calls, and stepped out two times. No big deal, in my opinion.

AND THEN:

The lady working the register said \"excuse me, when you come in and out, our door chime goes off and it makes me come up here. Can you stop coming in and out?\"

So you know what: I am your customer. I tipped you $4.00 for a SANDWICH!!!! Your music is so loud I had to step outside a couple of times. Sorry I cramped your style, Capriotti's. I'm sure there is another sandwich restaurant in town that values my business.

Ridiculous."}
{"text":"...worth the drive although I did not drive here with this place in mind...

My fiancée and I sat down to this venue on 10/11/12 while attending an annual fastener show in Las Vegas.  All of the staff we made contact with were very friendly and offered recommendations on where to begin on the menu since it was our first visit.

In the end and at the advice of the lady working the register, we decided on the 20-inch Capastrami and DAMN it was so awesome!!  

The Capastrami is a combination of hot pastrami, cole slaw (I'm not a fan but with this combination it is off the hook and worked for me), Russian dressing, and of course - Melted Swiss CHEESE!!!  This is all wrapped in a hoagie that felt like it was steamed (crust did not flake off).  Like the pros that they are, these items, when brought together (in the way that they do) will definitely leave you salivating for more!!!  

Oh, by the way there really is no secret why this venue has been voted Number 1 over the years but in my opinion it all comes down to the customer service.  The food is awesome but it's the customer service that keeps them coming back for more.  

They're definitely on my radar.  Keep it going strong my new peeps!!!"}
{"text":"Price...slightly on the high side for a sandwich shop.
Taste...tipping the freakin' scales!!!  All kinds of GOOD!

The Capastrami is out of this world!!  If you think you can eat a small, get a medium, you'll thank me after your last bite!

The Bobbie is a very strong second.  That first bite makes you feel like it's the 4th Thursday of November. 

The other specials are good, but definitely try those two first. 

I could go on and on about how good the sandwiches are, but I think I've hyped them enough.  \"Satisfaction = Expectation - Quality.\""}
{"text":"I went here as a sammich alternative to $1 sandwiches at Jimmy John's (the line was crazy!). I attempted to recreate the sammich I would have gotten at JJ's (the Pepe with ham, mayo, lettuce, tomato, and provolone - a classic sandwich that's hard to screw up). Unfortunately, they ended up doing just that. The man who served me - I think he was the owner - was super pissed off (which I can understand because JJ's was totally stealing a TON of potential lunch customers) but he took it out on me and everyone else I was with - totally unprofessional. Also, I asked them to take off all the crap they include with the sandwich and they didn't so the sandwich was totally gross, not a fan at all."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot instead of hitting the regulars like Port of Subs, Jersey Mike's, or Jimmy John's. I ordered the cold Italian sub and my wife had the tuna. Both of us were not disappointed. I would continue to come here for sure."}
{"text":"Best vegetarian \"meat\" sandwiches I've had out. Got a veg cheesesteak (morning star chicken shreds) and a turkey and slaw (sliced smoked soy based turkey of some sort). Fan. Tas. Tic. Good bread, good portions, great veg meat, polite staff...I wish there was one of these near my home town. I would eat here every night. $13 for a 20\" sub just can't be beat."}
{"text":"The vegetarian options are really impressive.  There is a fake turkey and a veggie cheese steak which is pretty exciting! It's very tasty stuff but pretty salty too."}
{"text":"Our first time here! Parking was the biggest issue! There is none. So we parked at CvS across the street. My husband LOVED his Hot Italian Sub! I got the Homemade Turkey Sandwich... Looooved the Turkey!!!! Great sandwich!!!! Got a free bag of chips too for checking in on Yelp! Fast service! We will go back!"}

Was found after they were throwing up a few hours after eating there. One of his friends had leftovers and her mom found the mold that made  a bunch of 13yr olds vomiting sweating and sick!! Health department  was told! if u have the guts to still  eat there after hearing about this ... your a hero DONT DO IT ! !! ;)"}
{"text":"The Bobbie is the bomb.  it's the only sandwich I ever order.  I want to branch out but I just can't.   The \"real\" turkey as opposed to lunch meat turkey combined with stove top stuffing (which I love), cranberries and mayo on a soft bread roll is better than a lot of Thanksgiving dinners I've eaten.  If you had french fries, I'd give you an extra star, but it's a very very strong 4.5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my capasrtami. I remember getting a sandwich loaded with meat. Not what it use to be. If your looking for a good capastrami you might want to try the one across the street from sunset station. I was there March 18, 2017 around 8pm. I put money in the tip jar and not a ty or anything. I remember they would shout out \"beer money\" but nothing."}

{"text":"On our first stay in Henderson, we just discovered Capriottis, and are so pleased we did.  Carlos, the manager was extremely helpful.  The food was delicious.  Carlos made the sandwich for us.  They are known for their philly cheesesteaks, but we opted for a fresh turkey sandwich.  It was great.  We highly reccomend this location, and will be back during our stay.."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I expected a good sandwich. I got a GREAT sandwich. Bread was so soft and fresh and the sandwich was packed with flavor!!"}
{"text":"Just had the Bobbie after some poker playing at the Wynn. Great sandwich wow whoever came up with idea should get an atta boy award"}
{"text":"Capriotti's used to be the bomb.......not so much anymore.  Bread isn't as good as it used to be and the meats are so so.  There's so many choices out there...will have to pass on them and look else where for my sandwich fix.
As far as this location goes....dirty is the word.  Sticky floors, dirty counters, containers that look like they need to be washed.  Tables needed to be wiped down and just a general need of cleaning overall.
If you have to eat at a Capriotti's....try a different location than this one."}

Short description:  Sandwich shop
Pluses:  Decent sandwiches, some unique styles like the turkey dinner version.  
Negatives:  Tad expensive, Confused a 'cheese sandwich' with a 'cheesesteak sandwich', but was still very happy with it.
Recommendations:  I was really happy with the cheese steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Capriottis is my ideal sandwich shop. The quick service, variety of sandwiches and fresh ingredients make this a must visit. The turkey sandwich was huge in my opinion. I shared with a friend along with kettle cooked chips and was ready to hit the town! a definite must visit for a healthy alternative."}
{"text":"Schneller, freundlicher Service. Preis/Leistung ist optimal. Guter Tipp für sub-fans."}
{"text":"Wish I could leave less than a star.  
Visited when two younger male employees were working, one heavyset male with dark hair and a tall blonde.   
I walked into Capriotti's excited to order a cheese steak sandwich.   Two couples were in store but it wasn't busy like I've seen it at other times.   I was completely ignored when I walked in, and continued to be ignored for at least seven minutes.   Neither employee even acknowledging my presence.   I ended up leaving and taking my business to Del Taco, because regardless of me really wanting that cheese steak sandwich I'm also paying for customer service.   Something these two individuals seriously lack!  I would like to suggest customer service training for your employees.   It would've been a horrible secret shop!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Delaware - grew up with the original Capriotti stores!  Thoroughly enjoyed my second visit to this store in Phoenix..reminded me so much of home, brought tears to my eyes.  I am a vegetarian - ordered the veggie turkey and it was awesome - and - the bread - often tough to replicate the original from the East Coast stores - was soft and delicious.  The staff was very friendly, polite and prompt.  Mike, the manager, is from the original store on Union Street, in Wilmington Delaware.  If you are looking for a REAL sub from the East coast, with friendly, great service, this is YOUR place.  I am SO happy you are here."}
{"text":"I first tasted this sandwich in 2007 next to a gas station. 

The sandwiches here are to die for. The slaw be joe roasted beef with slaw, the capastrami pastrami with slaw and many other sandwiches are worth tasting here. 

I have tried Jason's Deli, Firehouse, subway and Mikes but this sandwich shop beats them all. 

The only reason these guys do not get a five is because the owners make different decisions. At one I can get a hot ham and cheese while at another one they say it's not on the menu so they say no. 

Still one of the best sandwiches around."}
{"text":"First time had the cheese-steak with mushrooms, loved it.  Perfect combo of meat and cheese on a soft bun.  And the small is PLENTY!  Cant wait to try more.  Also Fast service, and even after i drove home the sub was still too hot to eat."}
{"text":"The Bobbie, aka The World's Most Delicious Sandwich Ever. That is all."}
{"text":"Love this place. Come at least once a week.  They recently changed management and the new team is great.  Ignore old reviews with bad service.  New manager will greet you as old friend and talk you're ear off.  Really nice guy.  Staff is now very attentive. Go, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"A friend brought me to Capriotti's after a conversation we had about Thanksgiving dinner leftover sandwiches. I went (and returned) for the Bobbie. My first experience was better than the second. The first time, the sandwich and bread were made perfectly. The second time, the bread had become a little mushy inside and a little too hard on the outside. It was a little over loaded with toppings (then again, some may like that). I couldn't save any for later, because it was falling apart. I do still crave this sandwich and will be back during my next trip. This shop is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Stopped by this afternoon to get something to tie me over until my late dinner reservation tonight.  My first thought was \"Why don't they have a 6\" sandwich, I'm only going to eat a little and waste the rest.\". Ahhh, no.  I decided on the 9\" Capastrami.  Needless to say I ate the entire sub in like 4 stop lights.....it was that good.  Perfect blend of salty, sweet, hot, and cold.  The bread had a wonderful soft chewy texture and the sandwich was incredibly juicy and flavorful.  Not to mention the guy at the counter was very nice and friendly.  Oh and to answer his question........yes, I think you guys should open a store in Hawaii, we'd love it!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich! Better yet the staff our truly excellent. I left my purse there and they called me to let me know! Thanks again so much!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way to the Hoover Dam. Had a great sub, everything was fresh  and the sizes were generous. This is saying a lot since we are from NY and know our subs!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Best subs in vegas hands down. I love there cheese steak sub.. on point"}
{"text":"So good. I got the Philly Cheese Steak with onions and sweet peppers. The bread is really fresh. Prices are a little high, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every time I come in it brings a smile to my face. The service is great. And the greetings is always welcoming. And there's that one guy that works there, little young but he's so cute and friendly. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's is my go to place when I am hungry and don't have time to leave the office for lunch, I love that I can order online and in about 15-20 minutes lunch has arrived!  I used to order from Jimmy John's all the time, but they have lost my business to the new kid on the block.

Jimmy John's is so skimpy with their meat, but Capriotti's loads up their sandwiches for a filling lunch.  The Bobbie with pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo is so good, or if I am in a red meat kind of mood, they make a good cheesesteak, not traditional, but still tasty.  

Another reason I have moved on from JJ's is that you can only get their brand of chips, which are not that great, and Cap's has most of the standards...I just wish they would carry Cheetos and then they would really be perfect!"}
{"text":"Great service and the food is delicious.  When I went in for the first time the gentleman in the counter was extremely patient, recommended an item from the menu. Loved it. Been going there since then almost every other week for lunch. Thanks. .."}
{"text":"first off, these subs are packed with goodness. the guys that work there have been cool quick and collect. the place is comfortable to sit down to eat. sign up for their text msg club and receive some decent deals cause it is a bit steep at $8-9 for a 12\", but you get worth from it regardless. they have a few salads n sandwiches but i stick to the subs.

THE BOBBIE is tops. thanksgiving anytime. 
CAPASTRAMI is hella good.
CHEESESTEAK is for real.
GRILLED ITALIAN is delizioso.
but, the SLAW-BE-JO is a bit too slaw-be for me.

i look forward to trying some other items at the risk of passing up a sub i already crave..

so far, so great."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop deserves a 5! Didn't know about this place until a friend of mine brought back some sandwiches to our hotel. Drunk and hungry...I decided to take half of the Bobbie sub. WOW.....it was Thanksgiving in my mouth! So delicious! Homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing all blended in so well. I had the Capistrami sandwich which was also delicious! 

Capriotti's is a must when we head out to Vegas. Highly recomended! Blow your mind by having the Bobbie or Capistrami before you try other sandwiches. You wont be dissapointed."}
{"text":", boy have you seen them newest ingredients at Capriotti's is give it out in their sandwiches it looks like it would taste a little too much like plastic anyway good sandwiches guys we like gloves in our sandwiches"}
{"text":"Always solid sandwiches.  Very good quality, quick like a rabbit w your order and sure to be smiling."}
{"text":"First time going here the food is quite good and the portion is pretty decent. The food came out in a timely matter. The only complaint is its too dammmm hot no ac corporate is cutting back and they don't offer water :/ I will be back again i want to try the Bobbie. But I won't eat inside too hot"}
{"text":"I cater from this Capriotti's regularly to my work.  The owner, Todd is fantastic to work with.  He is always on top of things and makes sure we get our order perfectly,  no matter how last second!  He is awesome.  I highly recommend this shop."}
{"text":"So tasty. I got the bobby and it was delicious. The only thing stopping me from giving this place 5 stars is their lack of a place to park. Even without the parking lot I will definitely be back for the Bobbie whenever I have a thanksgiving craving!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 sandwich platters for a party on the 15th for pick up on the 21st. When I arrived to pick up I was told they had not been made yet. Now I'm being told to wait about 30 min so they can make them. Kudos that they'll be fresh but sucks that I ordered them early enough to have them back to my house and now I'll be making it at the same time as my guests. How they went 6 days and didn't prep this I'll never know."}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is always friendly and helpful. I come here for their vegetarian options. I always place a phone order, and it's ready when I come in."}
{"text":"Big sandwiches for the price! So good.

I tried the Capistrami which was awesome! Looking forward to trying the Bobbie as the employees highly recommended it."}
{"text":"Bobby and Philly cheese steaks are 2 of their best menu choices. 5 star every time."}
{"text":"Capriotti's sandwiches are fresh, tasty, of good quality and consistent.  My favorite is the capastrami."}
{"text":"I always get the Italian sub hot so I cannot comment on any of the other subs but my buddy from The Bronx swears by all their sandwiches."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are ok at best. My last capistrami had a bread tie in it that cut the top of my mouth. I called to complain and an employee took my name and number and said the manager would call me back. . . Yep all I got was crickets. I will never period go there period again period."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are just ok.  You pay too much for what you get.  I recently had a bread tie in my sandwich and cut my mouth. I called back to complain only to have my information taken and told that the manager would call me back.  Nothing.  Be careful here, they do not care about their customers and you might cut your mouth!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in old town. They know me and my order just walking thru the door. Great people and service, tea is amazing. Capastrami add sweet peppers: Love at first bite. -The dude."}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwiches that have that wow factor while staying simple. Love the russian slaw sandwiches but the crown jewel is the Bobbie...It's like heaven in a roll. Wish there were more locations in California."}
{"text":"DISGRACE! This is supposed to be a medium tuna. All lettuce and tomato. It has very little tuna. Save your money! Not the first time this has happened and the store can be more cleaner. Seems to be all kids working there and no supervision. Fort Apache location same way. Red Rock location still seems to be better. Tuna is the best and sandwiches are filled. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!"}
{"text":"My friend and me went here yesterday to introduce me to something a little different.  It was delicious, I had the sausage with grilled peppers, onions and topped with cheese.
The wait was a little long, but honestly they were getting busy, so I don't blame em.
When we finally got the sandwich, it was beautiful, in a sandwich way.  And it was delicious.  
I don't get sandwiches all the time but when I do, I am definitely  going to Capriottis"}
{"text":"Artie is the man!!!  I've always call in for catering and made to perfection.  Every sub on their menu is awesome.  Every time I have a special request, they will make it the way you want!!  And if you are in the area, ask for artie.  He will take good care of ya!!!"}
{"text":"Quality sandwiches. I've tried enough of the menu to know that you won't be disappointed with regard to taste, portion, or service. This is the best sandwich chain I've come across."}
{"text":"I want to give the guys working today the benefit of a doubt, but they didn't make it easy.

Capriottis is a good chain sandwich shop, well ahead of subway and on par with places like Jimmy Johns but with more calories. It's got a decent comfort food sandwich style menu. Prices are a little more expensive but the sandwiches are usually pretty well loaded.

I've been to this location before in the afternoon around 3pm. I was in and out.

This time, I stopped in at 11:32 am. There were two other people ahead of me already waiting for sandwiches. I ordered the pastrami and proceeded to wait. No problem: day off and have a fully charged cell phone.

It would've been nice to know the woman in front of me ordered a dozen sandwiches. The guy after her and I waited, cell phoned, and watched ESPN. While waiting one guy who called in an order walked in a grabbed his; but his was already done I'm sure. 30 minutes go by and eventual the 12 sandwiches are done. 3 more minutes and the guy in front of me gets his sandwich, and as he does two people walk in. A woman orders a turkey sandwich and a younger guy orders a pastrami. In 4 minutes the woman gets her turkey sandwich and is out the door. 

Okay, maybe a cold turkey sandwich takes less time and effort to make. Sure.

When the kid after her got his pastrami sandwich after me. That was when I knew It was bad review time. At 12:46, over an hour later, I did receive my pastrami. And it was good. But not worth over an hour of my time. 

I contemplated walking out multiple times, but I figured \"any second now.\"

Advice for locals who plan on coming here: call ahead of you know what you want.

Please don't let this review deter you from other capriottis."}
{"text":"OK So we found our new go to sub sandwich place.  We ordered the ham and cheese with extra turkey with coleslaw and the italian sub.  The bread is amazing and holds up well.  Even the way the sandwich is constructed is smart and really kept the sandwiches from being overly soggy.  I can't wait to try the turkey, dressing, and cranberries.  Also the pickled peppers are freaking amazing.  Makes me want to try it on a cheese steak.  Only reason I didn't give it a five is due to two facts:

1.  Over 2 hours for delivery.  (I can understand due to the fact that they are probably really busy due to the product we got.)

2.  The coleslaw was a little dry and lacked flavor.  (Could have used a little sugar, salt, and pepper.)"}
{"text":"Great customer interaction and one of the best cheese steaks from a capriotti's I've had."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place.  Best sandwiches ever!   I usually go with the Italian and then mix it up with the tuna.  They always busy which is always a good sign the food is fresh.   I love it here and people are always nice."}
{"text":"Passing through Vegas, and a friend recommended Capriotti's for the Bobbie sandwich. The one with turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, etc. That is one very serious sandwich, and while it is indeed a dazzling eat, the cheesesteak sandwich was even better in my opinion. So much to like here. http://oinkety.com/?p=2448"}
{"text":"The thing i love most about this place is that it's unique. It's not the same list of deli sandwiches you'd find at most other sub shops, and like others have said, the meat is shredded and not sliced. 

The portions are huge, so the price really is worth it. If you're looking for your $5 footlong, please do yourself a favor and run over to subway. 

Staff is friendly, quick (even when busy), and they know how to make a great sandwich!  The menu is slightly limited, but what they do offer is great. If i'm ever in a mood for a hearty sandwich, this is the place i go. My fav is the Turkey Cole. Yum!"}
{"text":"I am in Vegas for work and it's hard to find less expensive lunch places that are good quality food. Capriotti's is just what we are looking for with great flavored sandwiches for a low price. Adding the peppers to the sandwich gives it great flavor. They also have a chocolate bundt cake that is amazing. There is not much seating though."}
{"text":"Very respectful towards their customers and very clean and professional. I wish other sandwich shops treated their customers half as good as this Capriotti's does! thank you for the genuine service guys!"}
{"text":"I ordered around noon for pick up at 230. When I got there to pick up they didn't have the order ready and even seem unaware that we have an order. Needless to say it was late for our party. Never again will I order from this location"}
{"text":"Being from the south and now living in Florida you rarely find a great sandwich.
Well, look no further. The cheesesteak at Capriotti's is to die for. The melted cheese over the steak with the sweet peppers with onions and mushrooms....oh yeah you can't go wrong with the cheesesteak!

The Bobbie is also another sandwich that you must try. A turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce, mayo, cole slaw and Russian dressing.

Capriotti's come to Florida, you will have a new following of loyal customers!

5 Stars a must try.

There are numerous locations around Vegas so find the closest one to you."}
{"text":"Amazing meatball sandwich. I came here on a whim because I was at Firestone getting tires changed. The staff is very friendly and if you leave a tip they all shout thank you."}
{"text":"I have been to many Capriotti's Sandwich Shops in the valley.  Food excellent, personnel fair to poor.  This was my 1st time experience at the  Sahara store and it was hands down, phenomenal. I was cheerfully greeted by the most personable guy named John.  He was so polite and made some great suggestions for the sandwiches I chose.  His service was exceptional.  OMG Thank you Capriotti's for FINALLY hiring a professional person who really cares about the customers and takes pride in their job."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The meat on the Italian sub tastes so good. They employees are always friendly. It beats all the other chains with their flat, nothing-but-bread sandwiches. Capriottis brought the meat back!"}
{"text":"Great food. The sandwiches are amazing especially the bobby and Capastrami. Too bad they close so early"}
{"text":"Cheese Steak is incredible served fresh and hot right off the grill! One of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten....and a great bang for your buck!!!!! I've been to Vegas twice and eaten here at least twice each time"}
{"text":"If you are going here, I'd suggest getting the Bobbie. That might make this a bit of a one trick pony for a sub place, but it is a good trick.

The Bobbie is turkey, cranberry, stuffing and mayo in a sub roll.  Turkey is great.  Cranberry good, though could have been spread more evenly.  The roll was soft and fresh.  Only complaint is the stuffing.  A good stuffing, possibly a oyster stuffing would put this bad boy over the top.

This is a post thanksgiving style comfort food beast.  Not a killer Italian sub with premium meats and toppings.  But it is a feast worthy of a pilgrimage when the craving hits."}
{"text":"Big old turkey bone in my turkey sub !  Gross and almost chipped a tooth"}
{"text":"Super upset. I waited a half an hour for my sandwich (cold cuts so it's not like had to cook it) and I got back to my office to eat it and it's missing 7 ingredients. Disappointing"}
{"text":"This place is the worst. The employees are dumb as door knobs. I ordered 2 sandwiches today 1 was tuna on wheat bread and it came with a slice of dry crust which was hard to chew for my co-worker, and the 2nd sandwich I ordered was a turkey on a white roll which ended up being a tuna as well. That was just money in trash. Horrible service and dumb employees who need either more training or a different job that does not require reading. Rethink on going here. Bad! Bad! Bad!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Capriotti's locations and really like the sandwiches. This experience was completely different & disappointing.  We went to the one located at Baseline and Val Vista. We went about 7:15 and they close at 8:00.  We ordered 4 different sandwiches and they were terrible! The turkey was extremely dry & the whole sandwich was flavorless. The cheesesteaks were not hot and had raw onions instead of grilled. Their cheesesteaks are usually packed with meat, these were a weak attempt at a Capriotti's sandwich. The Capastromi sandwich was gross like the rest. Ordered the large and could only stomach half of it. When the sandwiches came out they were wrapped in plastic instead of being in a basket or tray. Worst $40 we ever spent. The 2 girls working there were unfriendly and acted as if we were a burden. If this location doesn't figure things out they won't last long. I would not recommend this location."}
{"text":"Consistently great sandwiches. Everyone is friendly and helpful at this location. 
Fan favorites are the Bobby & the Italian!"}
{"text":"I wanted to pick Capriotti's on my way to work but didn't have a lot of time.  While I had never used Grubhub for an order that I planned to pick up, I decided to try it.  It ended up working out perfectly.  I ordered my sandwich through Grubhub and by the time I got there, I was able to run in and pick it up and jet.

I ordered the Bobbie.  I love the turkey and stuffing mixture.  When I ordered, I asked for extra mayo.   It came exactly like I wanted.  Also, the people at this Capriotti's were so nice."}
{"text":"Just had the Capistrami with no Russian Dressing and it was delicious. If you like spicy, add the hot pepper relish for extra flavor!"}
{"text":"I just moved up here from. CAlifornia and decided to try this place out because I had heard so much about them. The staff was super understanding to my allergies and accommodated to all my needs with no problems. The guy who helped me Jacob was real cool and suggested ingredients I hadn't even thought of trying and made my sandwich way better than I was expecting. This guy (Jacob) needs a promotion"}
{"text":"Came in pretty late like twenty minutes before closing. They were cool about it. Didn't make me feel guilty about the time. Ordered my stuff sat down and waited. The wait was short. Took my food and left. Ate it in my car. The bread on the second half of my hot Italian sandwich was a little soggy. The only reason why this ain't five stars. Everything else was fine though"}
{"text":"This rating is about customer service, not the food...

I love Capriotti's food, but today I met the weird manager of my local store.  One of my favorite sandwiches is the Bobbie, which I've ordered for years with extra cranberry sauce.  Today, Michael (apparently the owner) overheard me say \"lots of cranberry sauce\" and he went New Jersey on me.  \"Hold it, I'm gonna need to charge you for that!\"  I explained I've been coming there for years and always got extra cranberry... without charge.

\"That stuff ain't free. I can give you the normal amount, but if you want lots, I'm going to charge you\" he said aggressively.  \"I just want what I normally have, can I have that?\" I asked, trying to make sense of the conversation.  \"I'm the store owner and I say what you get,\" he said.  Meanwhile, the guy at the register is being cool and trying to distract me.  I just asked him to do whatever he could and dropped it - who needs trouble on a Saturday afternoon?  

Later, before I left, a group of 8 or 10 people entered.  Michael takes charge again and barks, \"Before you get in line, you have to all decide what you want.  I'm the owner and you get in line only after you know what you want.\" 
 
I've been in Capriotti's all over, including Wilmington, where they started.  This is the first I've ever seen their Manager's Training in action... definitely not what I expected!"}
{"text":"One step up from Subway and much better than Jimmy John's if you're looking for a good warm sandwich, this is the place. Of course, I went during lunch rush hour and probably would have had much quicker service had I chosen another time. However, given the fact that they were slammed - MY ORDER WAS PERFECT. I went for the Cheesesteak and was very pleased with the sandwich. Regular size is 9 inches which is good for one person. The meat was good and the cheese was perfect - usually you get poor quality meat and too much cheese or the wrong kind of cheese. I added mushrooms and onions, which in my opinion, should come standard on a Cheesesteak, but didn't. I also had a side of hot peppers which really topped off the sandwich well.
There's nothing bad I can say about this place other than they're just a smidge pricey for what you get - but definitely not to the point to where I won't return and try a different sandwich. 
Don't have too high of expectations and you'll be well satisfied. It's a sandwich shop - NOT a gourmet restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent value; Had the Italian Sub, lots of meat...good meat!
Only wish they had wheat bread as an option."}
{"text":"Placed a large order for a party last night. All sandwiches were great except the Cheesesteaks (1 20 inch and 2 12 inches), which were overcooked and dry with very little meat, cheese or flavor.  When I called the restaurant to complain, I was told to bring the sandwiches back in, but since I had a party going on at my house, this was not feasible.  I was then told to bring the sandwiches in the following day for 1/2 credit. When I requested a refund or a full credit toward the same sandwiches, I was told no. I feel they should back their quality better than that.  We were very long time customers who always order this particular sandwich, so we know what the quality should be.  We will no longer patronize this location as they were very rude and do not guarantee their quality."}
{"text":"Our sandwich (turkey, stuffing, cranberry) was good, although my husband and I both had the runs that night.  They refused to serve us tap water.  They sell their own brand of bottled water.  When I raised a stink about it, they sullenly gave me some in a small soup container.  I don't know if it's a Vegas thing to not give a care about the environment, or just their corporate culture.  The staff seemed genuinely confused why I wouldn't buy a bottle of water.  If you eat there, demand some tap water on principle, please!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Henderson a month ago I stopped for lunch and had a delicious Italian sub... Since then I've tried this place twice more: a roast beef sandwich that was so dry I had to stop chewing it and a turkey sandwich that smelled so bad I thought it was accidentally tuna. No idea what's going on here but the meats are really not edible. With so many other places you can eat in Henderson, I'd not try this place again."}
{"text":"We ordered a Bobbie and a Turkey sandwich. The place was dirty and the bread was dry and old. The Bobbie is the sandwich I really wanted to try, and it was awful. The inside of it was kinda frosty too. The turkey sandwich had dry bread too. I gave them 2 stars because the boys working there were nice. Maybe this location is different than the rest? I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Wow great place!
I came here with my boyfriend when we dropped into town a couple weeks ago for a music festival and it was a great experience. We've never tried Capriotti's before, but we're definitely a fan now. The staff was very polite and helpful. We were greeted right away and the manager, Ditas, helped us throughout our ordering process. My bf got the Bobby (basically an epic thanksgiving sandwich) and I got their version of a pastrami sandwich with a side of their chips. It's a very casual, order at the counter, type of establishment. The manager mentioned there are several locations scattered throughout the valley, but my gut is telling me to this location (for the next time we come into town) because of the great customer care from management.lol thanks guys! Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Used to say Subway was my favorite sandwich place but Capriotti's has knocked Subway off its pedestal.  I put a lot of weight on the bread of a sandwich and their's is great.  Just the right amount of chewy.  Tried the Bobby once (very unique) and loved it but keep going back to a basic turkey or roast beef with lettuce, tomatoes, and vinegar and oil dressing with herbs.  Perfect.  I'm usually able to resist their gigantic brownies.  Aren't you proud of me?"}
{"text":"Wish I lived closer to this place - i would eat the Bobby every week!"}
{"text":"I tried to eat just one!! I keep coming back!! Best homemade turkey and Bobbie ever!!! I mean c'mon!! Butterball turkey!!! It's like thanksgiving every time if take a bite!!  Cheesesteak sandwich with sweet peppers BOOM! Flavor masterpiece! Staff is always fun and cheery making my experience a good one with every visit."}
{"text":"Don't get your hopes up! Decent sandwich but nothing to brag about and definitely not the best in America. Had the Bobbie and Capastrami during two visits and they just fell short ... Too bad :/"}
{"text":"Ordered to go. I advised them pick up time at 1130 and it wasnt ready till 1145. Cheese steak sandwich was ordered with the works. It came plain. The food tasted good but the sandwiches seemed they where made without pride."}
{"text":"Got a large steak cheese sandwich, and it is really long!  Enough to feed 3 people.  Ordered with spicy peppers and it was delicious.  Even my 3 to liked it, she said \"Spicy, but it is ok\""}
{"text":"One word: Capastrami. 

What's in it? Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw.

All the other sandwiches there are well above average, but the capastrami will KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF!

The bf used to live in Vegas so he knows the local places to hit up. This is DEFinitely his FAVORITE sandwich place in the whole world!  Whenever we visit Vegas now, he ALWAYS brings up Capriottis and the Capastrami sandwich.

We have yet to find a comparable sandwich.

The perfect lunch: My boyfriend and I sharing a 20 inch Capastrami sandwich cut in half, a bag of Salt and Vinegar chips, a can of Arizona Iced tea, and a diet coke.

There isn't much seating, but you can easily grab to-go."}
{"text":"I don't get why people rave about this place. I mean I'm sure you're happy to be in Vegas and you're probably having fun, but k'mon, you still gotta be fair to the food you're rating...

I came here once. My friend was pretty excited to try this place out during this trip. I got the Bobbie, which is a very big Thanksgiving leftover sandwich. 

I don't know about you but it makes no sense to me to put stuffing in a sandwich. It's just starch on starch and makes the sandwich unnecessarily heavy. The flavor of the stuffing doesn't bring much to the table either. 

My whole sandwich came to me cold. EVEN THE BREAD WAS COLD! I suspect they premade my sandwich and just pulled it out of the fridge when we ordered. Why would any sandwich shop serve refrigerator temperature bread???

I guess if you work and live in Vegas this might be an OK lunch spot, but if you come from out of town, there are much better places to spend your appetite. Don't waste a meal here!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Both times we have ordered online, they've screwed up our order. Today, paid almost $40 for 2 sandwiches, and asked for extra cheese on one, and to have the other one heated up. Also paid $6 for delivery since I can't leave the house this very second. Some random person without a uniform or anything delivered the order, with no receipt or anything. (Also tipped her as well) Once I realized the order was screwed up, I called them and told them the issue. They basically told me I was lying and told me to BRING IT BACK and they'll make me a new one. I JUST PAID A 6 DOLLAR DELIVERY FEE ON TOP OF A TIP!!! They sounded like angry teenagers, and I never leave bad reviews for places but this place is a disaster, take your business elsewhere!!! I will NEVER order from this Capriotti's again."}
{"text":"Unfortunately since the re-opening we have been here 3x with less than good results.  We all used to LOVE Caps.  The staff is rude and unhappy.  Today took us 35 minutes for 2 sands, all other orders were filled before ours, we had to ask twice and then got really rude response.  Asked for certain items on Bobby, got NONE of them (xmayo, xcran).  The guy didn't even apologize, just shoved the sandwiches at us.  Had very little meat, very little anything but bread.  Paying for remodel by skimping on sandwiches.  They weren't very busy, now we know why!  Happy Thanksgiving ...Long wait, incorrect order. Not worth it. Not the only sandwich shop in town!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible.

Honestly, used to have a love affair with this restaurant. The Capistrami was my favorite sandwich of all time!

Those days are over. I am done with dealing with Capriotti's terrible service, dirty dining area, and general lack of caring about their customers. There are 5 other sandwich shops 2 blocks away, I highly recommend any of them over this place. There is nothing Cap's can do to win me back.

So, what happened that finally has me writing this poor review:

Went into Capriotti's during lunch. Paid for a sandwich for myself and was feeling generous, so I paid for my co-worker too. My name was called, Capistrami #1 appeared; I was excited. Now to wait for the second sandwich and commence with sandwich Nirvana. Waiting by the counter to pick up my sandwich, nothing. Next customer is called followed by the next. Still nothing. I finally ask where my sandwich is. I was told that it should be coming soon. Two more minutes of anticipation... I think to myself, fine, the sandwich is worth it. Employee yells out \"Capistrami for Scott.\"

The employee turns to me and then states, \"we ran out of Capastrami meat\". I can make you another sandwich.

No, I am sorry, no, we screwed up, no, this is rare, no apology. Just \"we ran out of Capastrami meat\". I even asked how do you run out of meat for your signature sandwich, with no reply from the staff. I finally asked for my money back (they didn't even offer a refund).

Honestly, this place was great eighteen months ago, but it has been on the slow and steady decline to terrible. I kept giving it a shot because at least the food was good. It appears, the latter part is now non-existent too."}
{"text":"After living in vegas for two years from Boston I can finally say I found a sandwich shop that can deliver an east coast classic steak and cheese sub! Great steak and warm soft sub roll combine to bring utopia to your taste buds. Two thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"Sandwich was pretty good, Service was phenomenal.  They were so so nice.  But my to-go order was messed up.  We ordered a turkey sandwich; turkey was written on the bag; but the sandwich was tuna.  We were on a road trip, so we didn't go back.  I still wish I had my turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"Came in knowing there was good food,  because we have one near our house in LA.  We were coming back from a lake trip and decided to stop by.  Today we went in and the older blonde lady behind the counter we always see when we come from our lake trip wasn't  very kind to us.  We had to speak louder and repeat our order.  When we went to check out, she tossed the sandwiches in the bag nit caring if the sandwiches got messed up.  We left disappointed with the service and debating if we are going to return.  Great sandwiches though"}
{"text":"Great place for gourmet subs. I love the capastrami, and anything with turkey. The daily roasted turkey's here definitely separate them from all the other sub shops. The only thing it's expensive ($9.50 for a 12\" sub) but if you get lucky you can get a survey on your receipt for $3 off your next order. The service is getting better, but it can still be slow during peak times because the sandwiches by convention take longer to make than say at a jimmy john's."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great sandwich this is the place to go? I highly Brecommend the BOBBY. fresh turkey, stuffing, and cranberry. Just like thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Being from the east coast, Boston area to be specific, I miss a good sub.. These guys fill that void with their steak and cheese subs. Great size, seasoned well, and all at a decent price point. 

I will say for cold sub's I would rather go to jimmy johns instead. But if you're looking for a steak and cheese, this is the place to go"}
{"text":"I went to Capriottis today on Maryland Pkwy after reading all the outstanding reviews on Yelp. So? So I cannot tell you if the food his great, because I couldn't bring myself to place an order. 

When I parked my car, I noticed a guy sitting a one of the tables outside smoking a cigarette. I looked again, and saw that he was an employee of the restaurant, wearing a white outfit and an apron. Well, that's not the most mouth watering thing to see before going to eat in a place, but hey, no worries, the guy's a pro. He must wash his hands before going back to work, right?

Wrong. As I was walking toward the entrance, he threw his butt on the pavement and went inside through an employees door. 

I entered the restaurant, looked around, and bang!, there was my man, already behind the counter with the other workers, ready to prepare my meal. 

\"Hi man, what can I get you\", he said. 

I pretended to look the menu, and then went straight back to my car, and left to write this review. I'm really not picky about where I eat, but that was a complete turn off. Sorry."}
{"text":"Love their catering trays. Whenever I show up with these sandwiches, I get an appreciative and attentive audience."}
{"text":"Great little place. I'm from Philly and against my better judgement I order a cheesesteak......it made the cut. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This location isn't my favorite but it's still a good spot if you're on that side of town picking up ammo or something from Albertsons since both are in the same center. Their cold sandwiches are best when it comes to meat ratio, the bobby was too bready from a large amount of stuffing. We also chose the capastromi which was great but short on meat. The capastromi has coleslaw, Russian dressing, Swiss and hot pastrami. I've learned \" easy on the slaw\" is right for me."}
{"text":"The bobbie is even better the 2nd day.  This after the sammie had been in the car for about 2 hours, driven to the airport, x-rayed, crammed underneath an SWA airplane seat, refrigerated overnight and battled OC morning commute traffic.

That - folks - is one magic sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Amaaazing sandwiches. I had the homemade meatball (not an option I would usually go for) and it was delicious. The sauce was light and meatballs fresh and plentiful. I added fried onions and it rounded it off perfectly with the crispy bread.

The 9 inch sandwich kept me full all day so was great value at 7.50. I can only imagine how humongous and filling their largest size sandwiches (20inch) are! 

The staff were super friendly and really funny.

A great little place and I'm glad to see business like this doing so well in Vegas."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for the last couple of visits to Vegas but never got around to it until this last trip.  I got their most popular sandwich \"The Bobbie\" in the medium 12\" size.  It comes with turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo.  I thought all of the combined ingredients tasted very well together plus the bread was very good too.

I would definitely come back for this sandwich and if I ever get tired of it, I will try some of their other sandwiches which I have a feeling are excellent as well."}
{"text":"Let's start with the basics:  It's a sandwich shop, so how hard can it be to get things right?  There's only something like 17 billion of these stores in town now, right?  So what makes this one stand out?

Being an avid lover of the \"sammich\", I rotate regularly between Subway/Jimmy John's/Port of Subs/Earl/Firehouse, but this particular location is my favorite.  The staff is always nice and courteous and not once has my order been done wrong even when phoned in.  

Over the years I've seen many of the same people working here, which is a good sign because places with heavy turnover are indicators that ownership/management cares little about the employee, which also tends to lead to poor customer service given that their \"people skills\" aren't terribly great..

There are the little things I tend to look for since I eat so many sandwiches such as the freshness of the bread, quality of the meat, or having the meal drowned in too much mayo.  They never come up short at this location.

Is the location and staff clean?  Absolutely.  There is nothing worse than seeing a worker covered in crumbs leaning to make your sandwich (which I've witnessed elsewhere at non-Capriotti's chains).  They simply do it all right here, and in fact, I'm leaving now to go get a sandwich!"}
{"text":"Service is always warm and friendly here. Who says you need to pay a load of money to eat great tasting food? just $10 is good enough at this spot. try it out!"}
{"text":"YUMMY!! This place was super good!! The price was cheap for how big the sub was. It was such a hole in the wall, but very delicious!"}
{"text":"To start, I've never actually been inside to place our order someone in the house usually brings home what we want so my review is mostly for the food. However, my family has said that all the people are very, very nice, throw in some extras and are helpful!

I have had the Homemade Turkey, Awesome! It really is thanksgiving turkey. I recommend that and also the meatball sub. Both very tasty. I have had the cheesesteak and I must say was not only lacking flavor but also they skimped on the meat! I mean come on, a cheesesteak should be satisfying and filling but where was the meat? It was all bread. Plus, it comes with white american cheese which I do not eat on a cheesesteak so I substituted it for provolone. They only offer provolone, white american or swiss. It would be nice if they offered cheddar for the kids and mozzarella. The bread is fresh, soft with a little bit of a toast to it. Very good. My son loves the kids turkey sandwich meal. The bread is great and the veggies are always fresh. You can definitely see the quality of ingredients and how fresh everything is. The guys even once threw in an extra juice box at no charge when they found out it was for a hungry little growing boy! Very cool you guys ;)"}
{"text":"The wait was WAY TO LONG. When I arrived two other people were in there.  I placed an order for a small Bobbie (not too complicated), my daughter chose the 1/2 Turkey & salad.  As we waited, waited some more, and then even longer... 28 mins later I asked, \"Is Traci's order ready?\"  They were confused. Yes, the shop started to get a lunch crowd after I had ordered, but 30 minutes later and still no food. :/

My food still wasn't ready, so I told him I would pay for the two drinks and bag of chips we had already opened.  He had no problem ringing those up quickly.  I ended up leaving here 43 minutes after I walked in WITHOUT ANY FOOD and was not even offered a complimentary drink for our time.  RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"This is THE best Capriotti's location!  Friendly staff, and the subs are just amazing here.  The best cheesesteak subs and the meatball subs are my other favorite.  Homemade meatballs!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place and great prices!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Capriotti's!! I travel around the valley for work, so if there's a Capriotti's around, I will find it :) But, I am writing a review of this particular location... First & foremost, I could not find this location via my maps, and was instead routed to the Corporate office - probably some issue with my maps; however, it was lunch time & I was getting hangry!! I called & got directions, which I was given very nicely. In addition, I placed my sandwich order (cole turkey) over the phone. The lady working the cash register was very nice & I made sure to add some beer money. I waited a few minutes for my sandwich - although I had called ahead to place the order. I decided to sit down and enjoy my sandwich - it was in no way up to par compared to other locations: the sandwich was dry, even with the coleslaw & dressing!! How is that even possible?! Quite disappointing... I will choose another lunch spot next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I like Capriottis BUT this location is horrible! Staff is rude, place is dirty, they run out of condiments, chips, water etc. the wait is long, they do not wash hands and I saw one guy making sandwiches and put his hands in his hair then resumed making sandwich. The health department should be involved here."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the main place for my friends and family to go eat, any day of the week! My two favorite subs are the meatball and the Bobby of course! Stop by and try it out, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We should not expect much from part time help and Capriottis does not disappoint.  Could not get. Anyone to answer the phone after three attempts. They have lost their way from the heady days when they imported bakers from the east coast. We will not try again.."}
{"text":"Edit: I returned because I received a gift card to none other than Capriotti's.  One of the employees apologized (a young adult with long hair; he was sincere and pleasant) about the incident mentioned below.  I bumped them up to 2 stars.  Service was still pretty bad, food was still pretty good.

This was my 4th time visiting the location on Mill Ave. I will try to keep my review short and not so sweet. 

Good things first. They make a quality sandwich. The (sub) bread is great, veggies taste fresh, and the sandwiches are huge. I get the tuna there and it is pretty darn scrumptious. So why the 1 star review?

Now for the negative. They don't have wheat sub bread, which isn't terrible, but I am sure is an inconvenience for many.  They do have sliced wheat bread though, however it is 6 dollars after tax for that tiny sandwich! Whatever, that doesn't merit a 1 star review. Their service is terrible. Service must be decent for any establishment to be deemed decent.  Every time I have been in the store it has not been busy, yet I still am not greeted automatically and it has taken at least 2 minutes to get my order taken. The sandwiches take far too long to make.  I usually wait about 5 minutes for a COLD sub, when the store is not busy at all.  Whatever still, right?  

Today I went in craving a medium tuna sandwich. There were two employees making sandwiches, and it took 4 minutes for them to greet me, the only customer in line. I ordered my medium tuna sandwich, and while choosing my toppings I was interrupted by the employee walking off. He returned shortly to tell me that they were out of tuna, and maybe had enough for a small sandwich. I asked how they could be out of a staple menu ingredient, and he simply blamed it on the prep employee. Ridiculous. I asked to talk to the manager and the 2 employees looked at me with blank stares, replying that there was no manager present. The employee said \"i guess\" we can make some more. Its going to take about 15 to 20 minutes though. I guess?  Unbelievable.  I asked if they had enough for the small sandwich, and he said he would check.  He begins scraping the bottom of a metal container.  I asked if it was from yesterday, and he said \"Uh, yeah.\"  Frustrated and not in the mood for making a scene, I turned around and left. 

Like I said, bad service can ruin a dining experience, or eliminate the dining experience completely."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are awesome. I was at a conference at the Hard Rock and came across the street twice for lunch. Really good food. The store was a little dirty to be honest, but the folks working were nice enough."}
{"text":"This was the freshest sandwich I've every had in a sandwich shop.  The combination of turkey and Cole slaw is not one I would have thought of bit it was scrumptious! !  One to recommend to friends and return to."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's not the finest dining ever and the shop itself is pretty low key, but they know how to make an Awesome sandwich!  My son and I had the Capistromi sandwich which was amazing!  Plenty of beautifully roasted pastrami on a hoagie topped with a coleslaw that was stupendous. I ate the entire footlong!  Definitely one of the best sandwiches ever."}
{"text":"While I love capriotti's overall, people should steer clear of this particular location. Overall the last six months I have gone in numerous times and ordered both the veggie turkey and veggie cole turkey for myself and family.

On each occasion the food and service has steadily declined. Generally speaking the employees appear to have a general disregard for the customers as indicated by the not so nice things said in under their breath. 

Although I can overlook rudeness when the service is quick and the food is good, that ended today. After waiting for 25 minutes to get a single sandwich, when I got it home to my surprise the sandwich was not only mostly bread but it was \"made\" and I use that term loosely, made incorrect. 

Personally if I was the manager/owner I would be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Super helpful staff.  The soup and salad I had tasted soooo good.  Don't let the co-location with a petrol station deter you from eating here!"}
{"text":"Sorry, Capriotti's. You get the crummy review today. My company had me 'just swing by and pick up' FOUR SANDWICHES that had been called in on my way back from a meeting. Flash forward 55 minutes and sixty bucks later and I'm still in the shop, having watched at least twelve other customers walk out with their food, some of which came in and ordered in-house. Not sure what takes four sandwiches so long to make or why so many others were served before me... but there I was. Finally got my sandwiches, rolled out and back to a very hungry team. One bite of my roast beef and I knew there was no way I was finishing it. It was the driest sandwich I've ever had in my life. I've had mouthfuls of sand that had more moisture. Another coworker had the same sentiments. After FOUR phone calls over the next 3 days with no manager on site, but four promises to have one call me back, Capriotti's gets the crap review. This was my first and last visit to this restaurant. I'm sure others have had great experiences here, but I'm not willing to flush $15 a sandwich when there are other options. Lookin' at you, Sunset location..."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is excellent in general.  This location (in the Santa Fe Station Casino) is even better than most.  That's surprising considering that the casino smoke wafts right into their eating area.  But, the food is excellent, there's more seating in a less cramped environment, and we can buy refillable glasses of soda pop (our stand-alone Capriotti's only has bottles)."}
{"text":"There were two problems: slowness of processing my order and the food itself. I ordered a chicken cheesesteak with mushrooms. My friend and I ordered at the same place in food court of the Red Rock so our orders would come out the same time.  It took an extra 10 minutes longer for my food. When I asked about my order they blamed the provalone cheese. Then they started cooking it.

The sandwich itself was missing the meat and cheese from a third of it. The chicken was dry and over all it was extremley salty.

If you are at the Red Rock don't go to Capriotti's."}
{"text":"One of us had the Black and Bleu salad, and it was fresh and delicious.  The other had a Slaw Be Jo sandwich, and said it was the best sandwich ever.
The staff was very friendly and the restaurant was clean and cool."}
{"text":"The bagels are the best i've had!!
 Try the egg/.bacon/cheese on a everything bagel...Its over Johnny Its over!
      BillyRay"}
{"text":"I will always call ahead with my order vs. just driving down to this location. On several occasions and most recently  tonight, Friday (and usually about 6:30 -7pm) I wanted to order a couple sub sandwiches only to be told they are out of sub bread!  We come to  Cappriottis because the sub sandwiches are the best... We are disappointed at best and management needs to review their bread inventory so they don't run out!!"}
{"text":"Again visiting from beautiful SD, ate at Capriottis. The food was great. Small shop off S Las Vegas Blvd. check it out. It feels like a mom and pop shop. I had the 9\" Cheese Steak and my son had the 12\" Italion."}
{"text":"Now I give this location 2 stars because I usually love the service. I called as soon as they opened and asked if it was possible to get a large party platter at noon giving them two hours time. The kid that answered the phone aka Gustavo, told me \"uhhhhh, ummmmmm, uhhhhh, yeah I don't think that's a possibility.\" I asked to speak with the manager as their service is usually amazing, but alas he was not there. Gus told me he didn't feel comfortable making them. HELLO aren't you solely a sandwich shop? I suggest that a business shouldn't have an employee who can barely speak with out saying um every other word answer your phones. Also quick suggestion, someone who can't make sandwiches that works at a SANDWICH shop should probably not open alone! Moral of the story is the location on Sunset and Marks answered my call, spoke to me like professionals and said, \"absolutely no problem!\" Needless to say Gustavo missed out on a fat tip and the peeps at Sunset/Marks are getting a bigger tip because they rock."}
{"text":"Always a good sandwich. I love the bobbi... yum. Fresh turkey is my favorite so I absolutely love capriotti's"}
{"text":"The best Sandwiches I have ever eaten,


 This is a franchise with about twenty Vegas locations. I ate at the one listed.


 We were driving into Red-Rock Canyon for a half day of exploring and trying out the 44 that we had rented and so we decided to get a packed lunch and picnic in the Canyon.


 I had read a good review of Capriotti's and so we went here rather than Subway or another boring sandwich chain.


 When you look at their menu online your mouth will water, and the reality was every bit as good. Our Sandwiches were stuffed with meat or whatever other filling we ordered and then they stuffed them even further with our salad choices, condiments and trimmings.


 We took 2 sandwiches each to have as Breakfast / Lunch and we wre both so full after the first one that we took the other back to the room and had it later as a supper!"}
{"text":"Food is fine, service is BEYOND horrible !!  I just waited 22 minutes for ONE sandwich, with NO OTHER ORDERS !!!  I timed it this time because last time I waited forever to get a sandwich. If you are in a hurry pass this place up.  They just opened a new one closer to my house, I'm going to see if they are as SLOW as this one, if it is, this is a systemic problem, not just incompetence."}
{"text":"After seeing all the Capriotti's throughout the Valley I decided to finally try it.  

It was an adventure getting there.  The BF turned to fast out of the Best Buy parking lot and I didn't get a chance to tell him he could just go through the Home Depot parking lot.  Oh well.  We had to do a series of turns since in Vegas that's your punishment for not knowing exactly where to go.  

Once we got there business seemed pretty slow.  It was around 8pm when we got there and you have to wonder why it was so slow.  The employees were nice though.  They took our order and we waited about 5-10 minutes for the food.  I don't know what's up with the $1.50 water though.  I think that's also a Vegas thing.  

I ended up not getting the water because I prefer my Brita'd tap water.  I got the Capastrami (small 7.50) which I enjoyed.  It has pastrami and cole slaw on it.  I liked that the bread was neither too hard nor too soft.  I'm not a fan of cole slaw but I have to say that it added a nice touch going along with the pastrami.

BF got the Cheese Steak sandwich (Md 8.25).  He said it was \"okay.\"  He prefers a whole bunch of cheese and bigger peices of meat (that's what she said).  I myself would have prefered more cheese on his sandwich as well.  

I will be coming back since the sandwiches are ok.  I think I would have to be in a mood for them though considering how much they cost.  I'm such a cheap skate."}
{"text":"They have online ordering so if you're in a rush to see a movie, this is a nice bonus and can pay for it ahead of time. The bobby here was just as good as other Capriottis. The order placed was exactly right. Made our movie in time!"}
{"text":"Came here back in May when I was staying at the HRH - I've seen this place before when I've walked to Walgreens but never went inside until this last trip.  I'm so glad I walked inside as the sandwiches are amazing!  I ordered a large (12 inch) Capistrami sandwich which came out to $8 or $9 but it was sure worth it.  They put a good amount of pastrami in the sandwhich which tasted great!  The only downside for me was that there was too much Russian dressing but it was also really good but kept globbing out of my sandwich as I ate it.  My friend got a roast beef sandwich which also looked great too.  I definitely will be coming back here when I return to Vegas next month, and yes, I'll be staying at HRH again!!"}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is delicious! I always get the Bobbi! I warm it up in the microwave and it tastes 100 times better. This Capriottis has the best customer service. They are more friendly here than other ones I've been to."}
{"text":"Horrible sandwich. I love the way places like this have signs outside stating they are voted the Greatest Sandwich shop in America! That is impossible, your located in Arizona, only have one type of bread to put your sandwich on, and don't have the bare essentials that are included in a decent sandwich. I had there Homemade Turkey sandwich. I have never had such a bland sandwich in my life. I'm sure everyone will chalk this review up to me being from New York but go try it yourself and see if you disagree. It's a shame whoever or however they got this huge sign hanging outside stating they are the Greatest Sandwich place in America ! Thumbs Down"}
{"text":"Much nicer friendlier staff then they use to have. Great sandwiches and soups. Love the selections. Salads are ok but not great."}
{"text":"This place was  a favorite of mind , but why should you call in your order live a mile away, get there in ten minutes for them to say, what order? did you order something ? then receive bread that is not quite soft or a bobbie with not so cooked stuffing or pastrami that is underdone on a hot sandwich. The girl working the register very unprofessional, she thought it was funny that she could not find the order and stated so. Her eyes looked glazed , maybe she only receive a little sleep the night before maybe she was on drugs.. I will report her, I do not appreciate her non-chalant tone and attitude. Please get it together, before others catch on and get the quality customer sales associates that your business require. I live in Vegas now and I would not recommend this location to others"}
{"text":"As far as fast food is concerned, it doesn't get any better than this. Been here only once and it still stands out in memory. I had the roast beef. My friends ordered other sandwiches and the portions were so large that we traded portions with each other. I didn't taste a single disagreeable sandwich. In comparison to other comparable commercial sandwich shops (Subway, Togo's, etc.), Capriotti's wins in a landslide!"}
{"text":"I'd searched google for the best cheesesteak in Phoenix (as I'm an east coast transplant as of July 2011).  Sadly, the well reviewed sandwich was a bust in my humble opinion. The supposed ribeye was beyond well done...almost completely dehydrated. They don't have cheese whiz as an option, and the provolone wasn't a high grade. I also tried the Bobbie, which saved me from one-starring this place. In house roasted turkey and stuffing were good (although still fairly dry). Not likely to return."}
{"text":"Open 24 7. Clean facility. Capistromy and turkey cole are excellent ! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"If you go to Caps. try The Bobbie, it won't disappoint! seriously, I ordered small, and had to take half home! 

For under 8 bucks, you'll get a Turkey day meal (kind of) . The service was great, super friendly, just down to earth nice!

I can see why that sandwich won some awards...if your just sitting around...go try it...it's awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is fastly becoming my favorite sunshine. So far everything I that I have gotten has been great. The service is great the employees are great love it. The only reason why I haven't given it 5 stars is because no where is perfect."}
{"text":"Nobody makes a better meatball sandwich - at least not anywhere I've ever found.  My GF likes the Bobbie and thay have a bunch of other standard and unusual sandwiches from which to choose.  They're most famous for their cheesesteak sammies, but I'm sticking to the meatball and provolone as their best.

Even the small sandwiches are huge and plenty of meat & cheese fill their homemade bread rolls.  They make some of the best sammies anywhere in Vegas."}
{"text":"Got the capastrami. A great mix of sweet and savory. And it was so filling!"}
{"text":"GF asked me if I wanted Capriotti's today.  I had to remind her how bad this location is.  She kept asking me why and I reminded her of the unsanitary conditions there and my memories of the long haired \"dudes\" leaning over making my sandwiches.  I never ate my sandwich.  After I didn't get a response from management a year ago regarding my complaints, I swore I'd never go back.  And I haven't.  Then looked at the reviews in the last year and my previous comments about the sanitary conditions are even worse.  

The franchisee obviously never goes in this location."}
{"text":"By most measures this is a pretty standard sandwich shop. I actually think their weakness is their bread, which is pretty uninspiring. That said, the meats and cheeses seem to be of quality, and the menu has some interesting options. Anybody who puts cranberry sauce on a turkey sandwich gets a vote from me.

When I was there, the place was almost empty, and service was fast. It's a little divey, which isn't bad for a sandwich shop, so that's not a complaint. I might come here again, but I don't anticipate craving it."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! I don't really crave things... but I got to say... Capastrami sub is soooo good & sooo big!!! I really like the Cranslam Club on wheat! 
This location is the BEST!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review while I'm trying to enjoying my meal at this Capriotti's  location. The food is good. But the staff.... oh man.

There must be a shift change happening. (3:10pm). A few guys walked out of from behind the counter. Just clocked out I assume. The all sat down at a table right next to mine and started talking. Loud F bombs, yelling at the workers who were still on the clock from behind the counter and a general uncomfortable feeling about the topic of their conversation is how I enjoyed my meal. Oh... and Dr. PEPPER  comes out of the Coke dispenser. I love this sub chain, but I won't be back to this one. Staff reflects management.... and with that being said, I'm sure my Capastrami sandwich addiction will have me looking elsewhere. 2 stars."}
{"text":"Had the Bobbie....OMG. awesome sandwich. Place was clean and staff was great. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Id give you three stars, but I tried you guys again this week and the same things happen. The food quality here for a good sub is fantastic. However, the staff can never seem to get an order correct. There is always something I didn't ask for, or specifically asked to not be on my sub. I've also waited over 15-20 minutes on a slow day for a hot sandwich. I even tried ordering online once and it told me it would take over 90 minutes so I called and cancelled. I really want this place to get better, because we need an amazing sub shop!!! 
Their selection of teas rocks and the bagel place is delicious next door for early birds :)"}
{"text":"Should have been called Crap-riotti's. I had their famous Bobbie sandwich the turkey was all dark and slimy the stuffing was dry and hard.  The whole thing was really salty & the sandwich just horrible definitely not worth $8!"}
{"text":"Must order their Capastrami.  Very good price for the size of a 20\" pastrami mixed with coleslaw sandwiches. I also tried their turkey sandwiches, but pastrami is still my favorite!!!!!"}
{"text":"Of course the sandwiches are delicious, not to mention they have WISE chips which are amazing. But the honorable mention for this location, is that when I walk in everyone working says Hi, when I leave, every signal person, even the ones cooking, yell Bye and Have a Good Day, I just love how consistently customer friendly they always are at this particular location! Yum Capriotti's!!"}
{"text":"New remodel, new management, just recently reopened. Use to love getting sandwiches from here. The last sandwich I got was just after they reopened. Ordered a Bobbie, which I normally love, I couldn't find the turkey on the sandwich and the stuffing was so dry I could not eat it.  So I'm not so sure I'll be back to this store. Hope with menu changes they all don't get like this one."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service from my three visits. First time food came out wrong, second time it took 25 minutes for one sandwich, third time waited ten minutes for staff to come out of kitchen and take our orders. No staff insight when we walked in. The staff here is never in dress code and constantly walking out for breaks. One time I saw a staff member come back with Starbucks. I've been a big fan of Cap's since I first had it, but something has to change about this horrible location and the bad service reputation it will give this company."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, with AMAZING sandwiches. The capastrami sandwich is one of the best things I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great service and good subs.  The pulled turkey is yummy and the grilled Italian was very good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Cap store! Excellent service to match the excellent food. Of course the cheesesteak is the best, however the capastrami, & the bobbie are equally delicious. Patrons are greeted as soon as you enter, music is playing. You dont have a transaction there, you have an experience!"}
{"text":"I want to go to there!  I was a local and I love Capriottis.   Here's why:  

(1)  Variety:  You can't get these sandwiches most places.  E.g. The Bobbie -homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing (mmmmmm).  You can get something similar in Houston now, but this was my first year-round Thanksgiving sandwich.

(2)  Quality:  The beef and turkey (at least) are made in-house and fresh. Pulled meat, not packaged deli slices.
 
(3)   Quantity:  Even the small is big at 8\".

Forget Subway, Potbelly, Port of Subs, Blimpie's, Jimmy John's, etc....  Go to Capriotti's and enjoy a real sandwich made quickly.  

Note:  Don't compare this to a traditional deli like those found in NYC.  You will be disappointed.  Just think awesome sandwiches.  It will deliver."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese steak sandwich for pick up.  Good friendly guy took my order.  Got back to my hotel (Comfort Inn) good deal by the way, and tried my sandwich.  Totally overcooked meat.  Flavor good but definitely well,well,well done.  Called and asked   why and was told that meat was frozen and depending who cooked it you wouldn't know.  Asked for the manager and someone who sounded as if they were 15 years old said \"I'm the manager\"  and pretty much said what you ordered is what you get..  Would not do again."}
{"text":"Had a very good lunch this afternoon starting with the cashier with the red hair smile on her face and what can I say about the manager and rest of the crew very polite,fast and great energy made me enjoy my chicken cheesesteak that was delicious!! Worth every dollar definitely coming back to this location!!!!!"}
{"text":"Capastrami sandwich with the cole slaw is unique and good. Definitely be going back for this one. Convenient location in the Red Rock casino."}
{"text":"i love this place.  some of the best sandwhiches u will find anywhere.  it is a small sandwich shop in a shopping center away from the strip tucked away in a reseidential area.  i love coming here.  Capistrami sandwich is prob my favorite but any of the special sandwiches on the menu will be a sure bet."}
{"text":"Always VERY good never great. I would still go 4.2 stars:) The highlights being the phlliy cheesteak as far as the sandwiches are concerned. But the devil is in the details, i.e. the WISE brand chips they carry, specifically the sea salt and vinegar ones!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this capriottis for a long while now! I've always had a great experience. The general manager and the young man with the long hair always make my visits the best! Always making me laugh and smile. Not to mention the food is 10/10!! (I recommend the cheesesteak with EVERYTHING on it) Within the last two months or so they hired a new team member (very curly brown hair) who is always very disrespectful. Never greets me when I walk into the store and seems annoyed every time he takes my order, but that is the only downfall. The store is always very clean and they play my favorite music! I definitely recommend eating at Capriottis, especially this location! Happy Reviews xxx Cheers"}
{"text":"Missing the three young ladies who used to work at this store earlier on in the year."}
{"text":"Perfect first meal after a 2 hr flight from California to LV. Serving size was perfect, I recommend getting the 12 inch and splitting with a friend. Wish they had a cheese steak place like this back home.

Hot, peppered, melt in your mouth cheese steak and grilled mushroom sandwich on toasted bread is my first memory of the start of my Vegas vacation."}
{"text":"Gigantic sandwiches. 9\" is a small here.  Good cheesesteak. Friendly service. Highway patrol eats here. Very reasonably priced for the portions they give you."}
{"text":"-1 star for taking a long time when only 2 ppl r before me, -2 star for not listening to order and not putting what I asked on it, even though u were nodding and saying ya NP... -1 more star cause I like  cappriotis and this store ruins it by having a slow stupid staff.  U get one start for the sub I got cause even if it's wrong it's still decent...go to other Capps!"}
{"text":"Employees have hygiene issues. Last week I went in there and the kid working the register wiped his nose with his hand, didn't wash his hands, put on a pair of gloves, then rubbed his hand through his greasy hair, and made my sandwich. I nearly flipped out - I took the sandwich, walked out, threw it in the garbage and emailed Capriotti's. I explained the hygiene issue in a nice email and the company never bothered to respond. Oh well. I threw away $10. Never go back again."}
{"text":"First i'll say the food was definitely a step up from regular sandwich spots. The bread was good and the meat was very tasty. So why the 2 Star review? Well do yourself a favor and NEVER order delivery. I have ordered 3 times here for delivery to our business address and each time they were late and the hot sandwiches were cold every time they got here. Our business is less than a mile and a half from this location. I have heard good things about this place. So I was surprised that this problem kept happening. The last time I ordered delivery it took two phone calls an hour and a half to get here! I still tipped well because I know they don't make a ton of money and it's the right thing to do but seriously? I work in a law office with people that don't have time to always go get lunch this was something new we decided to give a chance, only to be VERY DISAPPOINTED. We don't mind spending extra money for quality and it's definitely there at Capriottis, just not when it leaves the shop.  The business they are losing and have already lost is HUGE going to places like Jimmy Johns. I swear they are here almost EVERY DAY!!!  I will no longer order delivery, and most here won't either, but i'll give this place a final shot and actually go to the location."}
{"text":"I have gone to several Capriotti's locations here in town. This was my second visit to this location and will likely be my last. I ordered one sandwich. No special instructions and it took nearly 25 minutes for my order to be completed. I stood in line while the cashier chatted endlessly with the person at his register. There was a person in front of me who had also been waiting quite a while to place her order. Another employee came to open another register only to find it was not working. To which he was rewarded with a snide comment from the other cashier. 

I placed my order and waited for my name to be called. Needless to say, it wasn't. But the couple who ordered after me got their food and left. It was then that I approached the counter to question what was happening with my order. My sandwich was lying on the counter and no one seemed to know what was going on. I asked to speak with a manager and was told there is no manager. I replied, there's always a manager and was told that they would get the supervisor. No one expressed any concern or remorse except one young African American gentleman with glasses. 

Once the supervisor arrived I again asked for the manager. He stated he was the manager. I stated, no I was advised a supervisor was being summoned. He then admitted he was the acting manager. I again asked for the manager's name and he reluctantly gave it to me. Not once did he seem concerned about my experience nor did he offer an apology. If this is the type of customer service that is being given at this location, I will no longer be frequenting this establishment. It was a very disappointing and frustrating experience."}
{"text":"Cute little sandwich shop, with friendly employees. Plenty of seating and this location has an abundance of parking. My husband and I split a medium Steak and Cheese and it was amazing. The medium is more than enough food for two people. We ordered out and took the sandwich back to our hotel, and it was still hot. Would definitely order from this location again."}
{"text":"Sometimes Im not feeling the whole faux meat thing... my standard order is the veggie cheese-steak (sans the fake meat). Its a delicious juicy hot sub with all the peppers (sweet and hot, mushrooms, cheese, and lettuce/tomato.
Yum!"}
{"text":"This was possibly the best Italian sub that I have ever had. We found this place using Yelp on the iPhone while we were in Vegas and were not disappointed. I highly recommend that you grab a sandwich here if you are up on the north end of the Strip."}
{"text":"I recommend order online for exact pick up time. Wait time inside the store is just toooo long."}
{"text":"I have here a disgustingly bad roast beef sandwich. Inedible.

When I order a roast beef sandwich (and unless it's stated clearly otherwise) I expect sliced roast beef -- preferably rare -- and definitely not overcooked lumps and shreds that taste like dog food smells. Dry and chalky. (They also put cheese on the sandwich, even though I specifically asked them not to.)

This meat is so bad, I thought at first they must have given me the wrong order, so had to go online to check what their menu said. It's described as \"Our secret pulled roast beef recipe, slow roasted to perfection.\" 

The \"secret\" part I can believe. The perfection? Not even close. And pulled beef -- had I realized that was what they were offering, I would have never ordered anything in the first place.

Well, at least the dog will be happy."}
{"text":"The worst phone order system I have ever tried ordering from. Two days in a row was put on hold and finally hung after waiting for more than 5 minutes. If I didn't like the food I would not waste my time"}
{"text":"Food was great. Service was great. Excited to go back and tryout other items. I had the balsamic chicken salad my husband had the Italian sub.  The salad was not too big just the right amount of toppings and it wasn't drenched and dressing.  The Italian sub at fresh ingredients and the bread was delicious."}
{"text":"Best Philly Ever!!! Thank You Sam!!! Sometimes it is the little things in life that can Make You Happy- All it took was a Perfect Cheese Steak to Cheer Me Up, not to mention seeing a Friend Again - Thanks again Sam,, It wouldn't be the same without You"}
{"text":"Delicious food, but the staff was just ok, and it smelled of sewer smell. Not very appealing, so we won't be back. Too bad though, since we both loved our sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Lady at the register was nice and even made my large order in a good amount of time. I got like seven or eight sandwiches for my associates. 
Bread was soft. Ingredients were delicious. The only thing was when I took a bite into their Bobby sandwich, I felt something hard and it hurt really bad. I pulled it out and it was a very sharp plastic object. Check your sandwich."}
{"text":"If you're tired of Subway or Quizno's, then try Capriotti's.  The Bobbie definitely get's people's attention by being a Thanksgiving style sandwich but don't shy away from many of their other great sandwiches such as the Grilled Italian.

The only bad things I've noticed with this chain of restaurants is take out is the way to go since seating is very limited.  It is also highly recommended to order by phone so you don't have to stand around for 10+ minutes waiting for your sandwich."}
{"text":"I was referred to this sandwich shop by some co-workers of mine,  so I thought I'd give it a go. Store front was great, I was a bit excited to give it a go! First bit of disappointment was the kid with a lack of personality, who didn't say a word to me other than \"thirteen dollars, name?\".The total for my medium sized cheesesteak with mushrooms and onions was $13 (small drink as well). Wow, spendy sandwich, must be great!!
The disappointment continues as I search for a table, I was lucky to find ONE that wasn't covered in leftover food and trash. Great, I thought, this place has low standards and expensive food. I go to fill my drink, the soda machine is filthy. I set my drink down and go to wash my hands, the bathroom is trashed and covered in graffiti. 
At this point, I'm furious that I just spent $13 on what I'm assuming will also be sub standard food. Well, to my surprise, the sandwich wasn't bad.. At first. Then, I start to bite into giant chunks of rock hard gristle, and I even pulled a couple of pieces of onion peel out of my sandwich.
The only reason this gets 2 stars is because the bread and the flavor was good. Otherwise, this experience was pretty darn disappointing."}
{"text":"My sandwich was bad. So bad, that I wonder if they screwed it up. It was just a simple turkey sandwich. It was extremely dry and not tasty at all. What was supposed to make this taste like America's best sandwich? The bread wasn't that good either. Will never go back."}
{"text":"1st time trying Capriotti's and we loved it! Capastrami sandwich was amazing! Pastrami and coleslaw combo is a must try combo!"}
{"text":"Well, we just threw our cheesesteak sandwich in the trash can..... Ordered a normal cheesesteak sandwich and they decided to add peppers and onions for some unknown reason. I even had \"no onions\" in the notes just in case. (Sandwich is supposed to have meat, cheese, salt & pepper)

Tried to call the store and they picked up the phone and hung it up without even speaking. Unacceptable after you paid $20 for 2 sandwiches and chips. 

Make that both sandwiches that were thrown out. They added peppers and onions to my Italian sandwich as well and they were the super spicy peppers. Disappointing to say the least."}
{"text":"Random fact of the week: There is a Capriotti's in the Regional Justice Center. Yes, you will hear the phrase \"beer money!\" spoken in the same building where the Nevada Supreme Court makes decisions.  

Disclaimer: I am not a Capriotti's fan but I applaud Capriotti's on their business sense.  Desperately hungry people like me, trapped in the RJC for hours on end, will do crazy things to get fed.  My desperation led me to eat at this Capriotti's, a chain I truly despise.

Capriotti's, to me, is universally gross and this new location did not disappoint.    I ordered the Cole Turkey featuring dry, overcooked turkey, sweaty provolone cheese, dry coleslaw, and one slice of tomato.  Eating this sandwich was like chewing an entire bag of cotton.  That's the Capriotti's experience!  This place was packed though, so apparently it's popular.

Needless to say, once my biological need for food was met, I threw away the rest of my sandwich.  Sadly, I'll probably be back, whether I like it or not."}
{"text":"Scariest thing is that they've been closed down for health violations a couple of times.  Yeah, they keep their rating, but they still have to close to \"clean up.\"  

Breads they use aren't that great.  There's better out there.  Jersey Boys to name one.

Rotten parking!"}
{"text":"This location stinks. Ordered 2 medium Bobbie's which at all other locations are substantially filled with meat along with the stuffing and cranberry sauce. We received two sandwiches that had about a half of a cup of shredded turkey ( you know the stuff that is left over after carving) a cup of stuffing, and some cranberry sauce.  Hopefully it was because it was late in the day and they were running low on ingredients. Very disappointing Capriotti's, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Probably the Best Cheesesteak Sandwich around! Order the large 20\" sandwich for $12 it feeds 2 people or in my case just 1!! The Capistrami is unbelievably tasty! If you like sandwiches this about the best they get here in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I've tried two sandwiches here, both were dry.  That said, I would choose Capriottis over Subway 6 our 10 times."}
{"text":"Capriotti`s , What happened to your sandwiches ? Ordered a large mushroom cheesesteak and when I got it , I thought it was a medium . Are you kidding me ? Don't get me wrong , the sandwiches are good however , if this company is still going to charge $16 and some change for a large sandwich which is now the size of a medium and with less meat . I don't see myself or any other sane person buying anymore sandwiches from capriotti`s ........"}
{"text":"best sandwiches around unlv

excellent vegetarian selection
(all sorts of fake meat available in a variety of ways)

personally, i love the veggie burger

oh and get a small sandwich, it's still enormous

the most popular item is the bobbie 
(homemade turkey, cranberries, stuffing...)"}
{"text":"Capriotti's is my favorite sandwich shop. You must try the Bobbie. Everything great about Thanksgiving in a deliciou sandwich. The staff is always very nice too. You can call in your order too and they will have it ready for you. Great Service!"}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS!  

The Capistrami sandwich was excellent.  The Russian dressing was a delicious compliment to the sandwich, and the pastrami was super tasty (drool).

Our friend ordered the Bobbie (a \"Thanksgiving\" sandwich with turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing) which we each took a bite of - it tastes like Thanksgiving in one bite.

This will definitely be a place we frequent when we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the capastrami sandwich. Freakin delicious! And I'm not a fan of cole slaw. I've actually had their sandwiches before but only in Vegas locations. Decided to come here today and was very pleased. Service was friendly and speedy. According to the reviews.. I will be back to try the Bobbi sandwich. Yummo!"}
{"text":"Good luck if you order your sandwich anyway but the way the menu is, cause I swear the cooks are idiots and can't read. When you tell them no onions, it's for a reason. Some people are allergic to certain foods, and if you repeatedly say no onions on the sandwich and pay over $11 for a sandwich you'd expect to have the damn sandwich made the way you request."}
{"text":"Online it says they close at 11 i get there at 9:30 doors are locked all the people are making themselves food wtf is that fix the online, they cant make me food but they can make themselves food ?"}
{"text":"How is a sandwhich shop out of rolls ? This is bullshit , this is the 2nd time ive had a problem with this place dont ever go here shit workers"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times. Customer service was good, sandwiches were delicious."}
{"text":"Met up with my wife to help her at a store near by, so before she went home for our son to take his nap. Suggested grabbing her a sandwich to take home. I had food with me for work (which ended up be a big blessing). She got a homemade turkey sandwich, clam chowder soup, and my son a grilled cheese sandwich. 
Just got a txt from her that 1. She asked for no onions which she does all the time so know she didn't forget. Well it had onions on it. Then 2. the turkey she reported was very dry and bland. She could not eat it. 
Then the soup was sour! Hopefully she only had a small taste and doesn't end up having food poisoning! She of course tasted our son's grilled cheese to make sure it was safe to eat. She said is doesn't look good but tasted safe. Wasn't good tasting but at least not bad! As you could imagine I'm not happy to hear that what was suppose to be a break from her having to prepare lunch, turned into an upset and hopefully not food poisoning to come! Also now I'm going to have to waste time stopping by to get my money back. This location receives 1 star for now but if the refund goes smoothly, I'll change my current rating. Service was good but food being provided sounds awful! Thankful I had my own lunch!!


***update***
Updating this review to 3 stars because although it was a bad experience. The customer service was excellent in taking care of our trouble and happily took care of the soup and my wife sandwich."}
{"text":"I cant think of sandwich shops anywhere that i enjoy more than caps! Now im sure there are shops around who might have a specific sandwich they are better at, but for those who have not tried this place (any location really), trust most reviews and go check this place out. They are famous for the bobbie, which is overrated imo. Their cheesesteak  is best."}
{"text":"I have a friend that raves about Capriotti's.  After trying it back on the East coast, I had to have it again.  I like the grilled Italian.  It is just a really good sandwich.  My fiance got the Bobbie, the best sandwich in america, and we were not disappointed with that one either."}
{"text":"Our office went online and had a very large order. With regret, I have to write that they screwed up the whole thing from start to finish.  

For starters, We requested the order be ready at 1pm. A member of our staff went to pick it up at 1, and NOTHING was ready. They just started making it. Well, it's apparent that they forgot our order and scrambled to put everything together at the last minute. When he came back, you name it, it was wrong.

An Italian Chopped Salad with NO dressing.
A grilled cheese kids meal, the cheese was not melted on cold soggy bread and it never came with the drink or the side.
Three sandwiches forgotten.
Requested two extra sides of Russian dressing and received none.

Out of a total of 11 items ordered, 3 were right. So disappointed!!

I am giving two stars and not one, because they did refund us half the bill and delivered the new sandwiches (they are not a delivery Capriotti's).

HORRIBLE management. GET IT TOGETHER!"}
{"text":"The problem with this place is that it's in Vegas, and I'm not from Vegas.  If I'm in town I'm trying to fill my culinary itinerary with high end restaurants or food coma buffets.  

I did find myself inexplicably in this place eating a sandwich however, and they are damn good.  The best part is they give you a little card that has a prize for a future visit."}
{"text":"The food is great as always but my complaint isn't the food, but how dirty the restaurant is. We arrived at 3:30pm and we were the only customer inside. Every table had crumbs on it as well as on the floors. One table still had plates sitting on it. There were four employees standing around not doing anything. This location is new and decorated very nicely so I'm surprised to why it isn't be properly maintained."}
{"text":"Was here today (forgot to check in, boo)! I ordered the Bobby for the hub (no cranberry, add mayo) and the Veggie Club. The staff was super friendly- we were making jokes about food business and the like. Upon getting into my car I realized I forgot to add \"veggie\" to my order, making it a meat sub- no bueno!  I ran back in, apologized for saying my order correctly, and they remade it, free of meat and free of charge. I didn't realize this was so close to my house.  I'll definitely go more often."}
{"text":"I really don't care much for this sandwich shop I think Jimmy Johns's is better, anyhow my fiance loves the bobbie and I get suckered into it every so often. The wait is so long that you could almost buy a turkey cook it yourself and make a sandwich no kidding. We ordered a large bobbie and it took 25 minutes to get. Their excuse was they ran out of stuffing! NO communication and when my fiance complained to the manager they didn't care. I despise all the Capriotti's if they went bankrupt no loss. Jimmy Johns's is way better!!"}
{"text":"Good sandwich shop and very friendly.....but good not great.  For sure going back to try some other sandwiches but it's not going to be something I crave because it was soooo phenomenal."}
{"text":"20\" Bobbie almost brought a tear to my eye. It was like the day after Thanksgiving...leftovers on bread, just wonderful."}
{"text":"Best sub shop in vegas..

I get the bobbi.."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I dream about their turkey subs with sweet peppers! The remodel looks amazing as well! Great Job!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Subs I've ever had West of Atlantic City's White House.Subs.  I suppose it helps that the people who own the place are easterners.  Just great.  I always stay at the Palace Station hotel on Sahara just to be close to this place for my daily lunch.  Its excellent, very inexpensive and they have enough variety to satisfy me for six lunches there.  I love it."}
{"text":"The \"Boobie\" is truly a great sandwich for the fall. Prices may seem a bit high for a sandwich joint but it is worth the extra buck or two."}
{"text":"These sandwiches were just OK. I had high hopes due to all of the reviews, but wasn't too impresses. The ham is a sweet ham (super sweet), and I don't think it worked well on the sandwich. The bread is good, it would be great to take the Bread cross the street to Jersey Mike's-that would be a good marriage!"}
{"text":"They have all of the ingredients to make a great cheese steak. Great bread, quality meat, etc.. That being said, they need to retrain their cooks to stop overcooking and burning the meat and cheese. They really are ruining what should be an awesome sandwich. A cheese steak should be tender and cheesy, not charred and crispy. Ordered on the phone 3 different times, asked them not to burn it 3 different times, got it home and it was overcooked 3 different times. 3 strikes and you're out!! Gonna try a new sandwich shop.....Try listening to the customer guys."}
{"text":"Just had another yummy lunch delivered to my office from this location.  Capriotti's is one of my office's favorite things to eat at our meetings.  Everyone is happy when the food arrives. My orders are always correct and on time, and the customer service is extraordinary, they really go the extra mile to give me great service every time.  They make ordering lunch so much easier.  Thanks so much so for all you do.  
I just hope that the guy who signed the bill gave you extra extra beer money!
This is hands down the best Capriotti's in town!"}
{"text":"the BOBBIE, capastrami, cheesesteak, chicken cheesesteak! there are so many delicious mouth watering sandwiches to choose from! the quality is top notch! the wait is never bad & you will always have a great tasting sandwich! the best part are the sizes! large (20\") is the way to go if you're sharing with a friend! you can never go wrong with Capriotti's."}
{"text":"The turkey sandwich was bomb. Good price for the food. Took some time to make but it was worth it."}
{"text":"I theeenk they offer a variety subs? Unfortunately, I've not been able to order anything else since discovering The Bobby about 10 years ago."}
{"text":"Something has gone DRASTICALLY wrong with this location. Personally, I think it's the staff. They look like I can buy a bag of pot w their less than amazing soup and sandwiches. Bowl of soup......bowl of water is more like it. Was far from a bowl. More like a handful. Considering my last visit in May, when I placed order for 3 platters for same day for important event but 5 hours later and none were ready and had to wait additional hour and demanded my credit card be credited, I will NEVER EVER return after today's less than standard experience. Mind you they credited my card for over $100 in May, I thought I'd try again today. Waste of my time and $. ALSO, DIRTY PLATES ALL OVER. WTF happened to you guys????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I just moved to Vegas from San Francisco, and my boyfriend and I have been poking around on Yelp trying to find decent, inexpensive eateries.  At approximately 300 people's suggestions, I checked out my local Capriotti's, not knowing anything about the chain except that people's stomachs appear to be happy post-consumption.  

When I first walked in, I had a feeling it was going to be good:  I saw TastyKakes and Wise potato chips--both Philadelphia-area institutions, so I suspected that high quality, East Coast-style hoagies were at my fingertips.  I got the small cheese sub (I'm a vegetarian) and it was exactly the right amount of food if a gal is extremely hungry.  If a gal isn't, about half'll do and the rest can be jammed in her purse.  It was the first sub of any kind in a veeeery long time in which there wasn't something on or about the sandwich making it disgusting; in fact, it was totally perfect.  The vegetables were fresh and delicious, the peppers zesty, and everything melded together into hoagie heaven.  Oh, and the hours are great.  The Paradise location is open until midnight.

My only suggestion to Yelp readers is that, if placing an order for pick-up, do yourself a favor and call the (702) number on this posting.  There's another posting out there with a very different  number, and that won't get you Capriotti's . . ."}
{"text":"Let me begin my review by saying that normally, I would be giving Capriotti's a five star rating. My family and I have always received a warm and friendly staff response in addition to delicious subs and Italian salad. Today my husband placed an order for the wonderful Italian salad that we frequently ordered. This was also the first time we saw the new menu posted. Let me say that the salad we always ordered was more than enough for the two of us for dinner. It was large, packed with cheese and salami and garbanzo beans, in addition to onions and veggies, and large wedges of lettuce. On the new menu, the closest replacement was the Large Chopped Salad which we ordered. When my husband received the order he remarked to the manager that he did not think his wife would be very happy with the new salad. Wow! Was that an understatement! The new large chopped salad was easily half the size of our original favorite. The lettuce was chopped very finely into small pieces. The cheese and salami, what little there was of each, were chopped into tiny, tiny pieces. There were no garbanzo beans nor anything else in the salad aside from the blue cheese crumbles we requested that again, were finely chopped and lacking in quantity and quality. It tasted blah and was barely enough for one person. What a disappointment, to say the least. Although more and different salads were added to the new menu, if this is the quality they contain, I guarantee they will be a big flop. Let's hope there are no changes in the sub menu that we so enjoy or there will be nothing worth ordering. I hope this message reaches those responsible for the new menu and they realize that downsizing the quantity and quality of their offerings at the same price as before will only hurt their loyal business. I, for one, will not order a salad there again. This will cut in half the business we normally do at this establishment. What a shame."}
{"text":"Love the turkey dinner on a roll! Always friendly staff, very clean and the subs are huge! A++++"}
{"text":"One of the best Philly cheesesteaks I have had west of Independence Hall.
A big 12 inch sub for 9 bucks was more than enough to fill me up. The bread was  very fresh and the proper consistency for a cheesesteak (or any decent sub for that matter-which any sandwich aficionado will tell you is CRUCIAL). Clean, quick and friendly-hard to stand out in the glut of dining options in Dana Park, but they do it right, and I will be back."}
{"text":"It's so nice when a menu has a vegetarian section.  This place had four veggie selections that used veggie protein, 'faux meat'.  I didn't have to have the usual boring cheese sandwich!  I chose the veggie cheesesteak sandwich.  It was delicious!  The 'meat' was seasoned and cooked perfectly.  My sandwich was about 10 inches long and filled with 'meat', cheese and veggies.  It ended up being enough for two meals, well worth the price!  I will definitely return on my next visit to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The sandwiches are unique and fresh and always made right in front of you.  The service has always been good and the prices are reasonable (same as any other sandwich shop).  I have tried many of their sandwiches and enjoyed them, my favorite is the cheesesteak, but beware- the peppers are spicy!"}
{"text":"YUM! they make veggie cheese steaks where the meat is made of soy. SO GOOD! And a great option for vegetarians."}
{"text":"I had just arrived in Las Vegas with my teenage daughter and her gymnastics teammate.  All were hungry, so we used Yelp to find the nearest, highest-rated, cheap place to eat.  We ended up at Capriotti's, and I can't wait to eat here again.  On the recommendation of the guy behind the counter, I had The Bobbie, which is turkey with stuffing and cranberry.  I always say the foundation of a good sandwich is great bread, and The Bobbie I had was a great sandwich.  My daughter and her friend had (what I consider boring) turkey sandwiches on wheat bread.  My daughter's sandwich, in particular, wasn't great, but she always orders her sandwiches dry.  Her friend's sandwich had mayo and mustard on it, and she seemed to really like hers."}
{"text":"Ok. So I am in the restaurant bizz. I own a Pizza store. I have been craving a good Italian Sub.  OMG!!  I will probably be back here tomorrow. ABSOLUTLEY amazing. Great staff. Great service. Anyone who likes a good Sammie has got to go here!"}
{"text":"This location has restored my faith in the franchise.  Very clean inside, very polite employees and THEY WHERE GLOVES when preparing your food.  Top that off with an excellent menu (who am I kidding, I always get the Bobby) and you have a real winner when it comes to a quick and filling meal."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop in Las Vegas! The Bobbi is amazing. They use real turkey not lunch meat. Bread is super fresh and they have wise potato chips. (My husband favorite chip and he has not had the since he moved from PA 15 years ago) everyone should try this place at least once and you will be hooked."}
{"text":"Sandwich was meh. The turkey was unlike any other turkey I'd ever had had on a sandwich. It was as if you took a week old left over DRY thanksgiving turkey and shredded it up and stuffed it on a roll. It was a combo of white and dark meat as well as the bones (I had three bones in my small size sandwich). The chopped hot peppers were good though and by far the best part of the sandwich. Also, the guy ringing up my order was texting during the ring up process. Lastly, my sandwich was given to someone else, she opened it and returned it to the counter. The worker just rewrapped it then called my name and gave it to me. I was in somewhat of a hurry so didn't want to ask them to remake it but still didn't seem very professional. Maybe I would go back and try something different but doubt it. My first experience just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Call me crazy but i think capriottis(las Vegas) has better Philly cheesteaks than most places in Philly!! Their capastrami and philly subs are mouth watering! They will not let you down.its slightly on the pricier side for subs, but the taste will make up for it.."}
{"text":"Dirty. Stinky. 
A tiny little place with the restroom right in the lobby... Not a good thing for a restaurant   
Took forever to get two sandwiches. Over 20 minutes. 
Won't be returning."}
{"text":"This particular store is always very consistent and the workers are extremely friendly.  Due to a Freudian slip, I accidentally ordered a large Bobbie for me and a large cheese trio for my wife and came  home with 40\" of subs!  Oops.  Oh well, nothing like leftovers for the weekend.  It had been awhile since I had ordered from them so I guess I'm making up for lost time."}
{"text":"This is a new location... So I have to start with that... But come on guys! Dont open the doors if you don't have your act together yet... There are so many GREAT examples of how this frnachise is run here in Vegas... But when I'm waiting 45 minuets for (2) sandwichs.... That's ridiculous... Your crew was so busy making the phone orders or web orders, you were ignoring the customers standing right in front of you...  Thankfully, the food was still good, but the service needs some serious work!
*** update *** 
I'm leaving my previous review above... But I changed my stars to 4/5. I've been back a couple times since the above review was written, and this location has made some big improvements to service and speed. I think the combination of my \"hangry\" attitude on my first visit combined with the new-ness of the location caused the growing pains... But my last couple of visits have provided me with the service ive come to expect from the business. As always the food is delicious... The Bobby is a game changer! Obviously, one bad visit isnt going to stop me... 
Keep up the good work! Your going in the right direction!"}
{"text":"I love this place visiting it every time I visit LV. The bread is always fresh and tasty and along with the fact that they add Russian dressing to your sub, makes this place A+. The \"Capistrami\" is amazing. 

The staff is always friendly. Prices are reasonable and very accessible. It doesn't hurt to go on a Sunday and get a bit of show from the people hanging out around the Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Bad place. Was walking up to counter to place order and the girl behind the counter sneezed right into the food did not cover her mouth. We go to the Aliante movies at least once a week yesterday walked past and watched a kid making sandwiches and eating at the same time. Never see an adult there. Will never order anything from this Capriottis"}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches, wish that they would put mash potatoes and gravy on the Bobbie!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've read the reviews about this place and was so excited to bring my friends to try this new, cheap place that has a thanksgiving sandwich. However, everyone fails to mention that the Bobbie is a cold sandwich and i think that takes away from the sandwich immensely. 

I mean it was an alright sandwich but i felt that the hype brought on by yelpers and locals that i spoke to was in a word, exaggerated. The sandwich even had mayo on it.....mayo....thanksgiving dinner....I know I'm Chinese but even we don't have mayo on thanksgiving dinner.

I will say though that the woman workin the counter who was kind of butch was very nice and had a lot of local flavor to her. she even suggested for my friends and I to get the larger sandwich to save a little cash. After losing 900 dollars on craps, I appreciated the tip!"}
{"text":"Most of these reviews are correct and I would agree with them 9 out of 10 visits, til today. I got this \"while the cats away\" feeling from the staff. The young guy and gal were super cute in a flirting with each other kinda way. Too bad the tables, floor, trash receptacle area were in disarray during that. Store was not busy, especially since they were having POS issues and could not take cards. 

Not to make this completely negative, the food was good, just disappointed in the condition of the store, especially in \"upscale\" downtown summerlin.

We will probably be back because the food is great. Probably a one time thing... we hope."}
{"text":"Not a fan and won't be back. Service was slow with only two customers, including us. 

They use pulled turkey for the turkey sub. A step up from sliced deli meat but it was as dry as the desert around us. And, unfortunately, it had bones in it that nearly choked my little one. 

Then they have an entire salad menu, but none today.

Finally, the restroom was \"broke\". 

Thankfully the A/C worked and the drinks were cold."}
{"text":"Ok  so They are mediokre at best.  Have no idea how to do Catering or folow threw with orders could not even get it right  and ruined our lunch party.   I would not recomend them  I only hope they do better with others in the future  Very Dissapointed"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Italian sub but could have used more salami and pepperoni and lose the Black Forest ham please"}
{"text":"There are a lot of great Capriotti's shops around town and the food is usually awesome. Not this one, and not this time. The one on East Sunset (near Marks) has always been a winner. 

My FB review:

Usually awesome food; this time so-so. Lousy app and customer service. I tried using the BOGO coupon by buying a medium and getting a small free. No dice. Here's how it went down. 

After ordering a medium and small sandwich, standing at the counter:

Me: I have a coupon to get one free. 
Capriotti's: Umm, did you say a medium and a small?
Me: Yes.
Capriotti's: They have to be the same size. 
Me: I understand the small is the free one, not the medium. 
Capriotti's: No, they both have to be small. 
Me: Can I pay you more for the medium?
Capriotti's: No, they both have to be small. 
Me: Can't I just pay you more money and you give me the free one the same as if I paid less for a small?
Capriotti's: No, we can't do that. Our system really sucks and I can't do it. 
Me: Umm...OK. Then give me two smalls. 

They then roll their eyes that I've changed the order, throw away the already-made sandwich and proceed to make a small. 

Me: I get that you don't control the program, but I'd like to talk to the manager. 
Capriotti's: She isn't available. 
Me: Can I get a card or her number?
Capriotti's: She'll just tell you the same thing. 
Me: I understand, but if enough people let corporate know this is a stupid limitation, then maybe they'll do something about it. 
Capriotti's: Well, she doesn't have a card. 
Me: Phone number?
Capriotti's: No. 
Me: Email?
Capriotti's: No. 
Me: Whatever...

Sandwiches paid for, and I leave. Now the app is asking me to \"Rate & Review\" my experience. So there it is. 3/5 star food. 1/5 star experience."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good but the last two times we tried to eat there they were closing well before the time listed on the door. The last time it seemed they were bothered by us coming in a few hours before closing time. We have had good customer service there before but probably wont be back."}
{"text":"I love a good sandwich place, and this one is definitely worth a visit! I went here on the high recommendations of Yelp and I'm glad I did.

Freshest ingredients, excellent flavor and not just your ordinary sub/sandwhich place. I had their home made roast beef and was very impressed! By the way, if you need to feed a small camp of refugees, get the large... It's a monster!

I highly recommend it to anyone that likes a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Medium cheesesteak with everything sweet. Excellent flavor, great portion size, friendly service. Food could be just a little warmer. Really enjoy the cheesesteak, as a Philadelphia boy!"}
{"text":"Always solid!  We visited Capriotti's the other day and ordered the same-ole same-ole.....cheese steak sandwiches.  My boyfriend always gets the cheese steak sandwich with onions and peppers and I always get the chicken cheese steak with onions and hot peppers....with a side of mayo and a little salt....Dangalang!  Always fresh, always consistent.  Sadly enough I could eat this everyday.  The small sandwich is more than enough and its so good you cant put it down.  But I must admit that once you devour this amazing sandwich you will be ready for a big fat nap and to stretch out yo belly.

On a side note the employees are so nice.  Don't forget to tip them because it certainly is amusing hearing them all say \"Beer Money\" when they dont even look old enough to drink.  hahah"}
{"text":"This place was empty, my wife and I went in for a quick bite to go. I had never been into this restaurant chain but had heard it was good. I still cannot tell if they have good food because due to the rude workers and stink of the shop we left with out ordering"}
{"text":"I usually go to Capriotti's for one reason: The Bobbie. After yesterday, I'll go for two reasons: The Bobbie and the customer service. 

The Bobbie was even better than it usually is. The fresh turkey was moist and plentiful, the stuffing was flavorful and not overwhelmingly seasoned, and the cranberry-to-mayo ratio was perfect. It's been a good number of months since I last visited. While I've never had a bad sandwich, it seems that there might have been some recent improvements in the quality and quantity of the ingredients used. 

I had to wait a few minutes for my somewhat large order, but it was a very reasonable amount of time. The two employees made the wait a very comfortable one. They were personable without being overbearing and making the interaction seem disingenuous. They conversed just as easily with an older couple as with some small children. I left the restaurant feeling as though I'd been treated as a valued regular."}
{"text":"What more can be said about Capriotti's that has not already been stated. A staple in our house, our go-to sandwich shop, right by the house, check, check and check.

Favorites:
Cheesesteak
Chicken Cheesesteak... mushrooms? Yes please!
Cole Turkey
Classic Turkey

The problem is that I love these four so much that I find it hard to stray from them to try something else. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Fresh bread, fresh ingredients, ok service, those tasty bundt cakes, salt and vinegar chips. Winner. Count me in."}
{"text":"Just ordered a large Italian with everything on it and all I got was onions tomatoes and mustard.. called them back and all they could say was I'm sorry bring your sandwich back and I'll make you another it's been awhile since I've been there only because this is not the first time this has happened but at least last time they got my name down and I was able to go another time to get a sandwich I put in a 16 hour day today and that's the last thing I want to do is go back to the sandwich shop for them to make another sandwich I guess I'll just suck it up and eat the one I have. I do love having Capriotti's Sandwiches but I will not return to this location as it seems to be a problem getting the order right lesson learned I would definitely not return to this location"}
{"text":"I love this sandwich shop, and will continue being a return customer! If you are looking for a great sandwich shop, this is the place to check out!!"}
{"text":"I ordered from this Capriotti's at approximately 5:30 p.m. It arrived a few minutes after 6. 

I ordered the Cold Italiatian with pickles, mayo & must. I really enjoyed it. 

My Boyfriend had the Meatball sub. He said the meatballs were dry on the inside, he wouldn't eat it again & he preferrs subway...

I ordered 3 White Chocolate Macadamia Cookies. I received 1 sugar cookie, 1 peanut butter & 1 Chocolate chip ... Very disappointed & they were a little stale. Even if they did not have White Chocolate Macadamia they should have called & offered alternatives.

Lastly the free delivery if you order online coupon does not work. I tried typing in \"YELPDEL\" as advertised, multiple times & it said it was EXPIRED."}
{"text":"A lot of places claim to have cheesesteaks that taste just like the ones in Philadelphia.  This is almost always false.  I've lived in Philly, and most don't come close.  Capriotti's is not quite the same, but still really, really good."}
{"text":"mmmmmm... the bobbie (thanksgiving on a sandwich) or the capistrami... oh boy is this place delicious."}
{"text":"The Bobbie is one of the greatest meat sandwiches ever created.  You got turkey, mayo and cranberry sauce on a giant roll.  I don't think I have ever ordered anything else from there!  That's how Double Bomb the sandwich is!"}
{"text":"If it was possible I would give 3.5 stars.  I rounded down because the first time I ordered from here they screwed up my sandwich (I ordered a cheese hero and they gave me a ham and cheese hero - ham-stink is permanent and since I detest ham, it was a whole sandwich killer).

Meatball hero was pretty good though I would not rush back to get another.  When I finally did get a cheese hero, it was delicious - this I would rush back to get.  Husband loves the Bobby.

The service is a little slow so I'm going to try ordering through their website the next time.  Capriottis has definitely earned a spot in my sandwich place rotation."}
{"text":"Straight from the airport, or sometimes right after check-in at my hotel, I hop on a taxi and go straight here. Get my Capristrami on right away. Order the 20\" and if I don't finish I take it back to the hotel for a snack later (Las Vegas Hotels usually don't have a fridge though.. gotta put this in a bag on ice haha). All my friends I have taken here have agreed that this is one of the best affordable eats. 

This area is for the stocking up for your Vegas trip!!! Walgreens in the same plaza...diagonally across the street is a liquor store to get your pre-party booze. Across the street is Hard Rock Hotel to grab your cab back to the strip or stop for a pool-party!

I've gone here multiple times over the years.....still DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not supposed to order a cold sub but my roast beef was the driest sandwich I've ever tasted.  I seriously was afraid I was going to choke since it was so dry. Instead of slices of juicy roast beef, they were dry beef shavings. Unfortunately, they don't provide free cups of water since they don't sell fountain drinks.   My daughter's turkey sub was ok.  Maybe I should've researched more and gotten a more popular sandwich.  For the price, I will definitely go elsewhere in Vegas."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because I was looking for a good sandwich.   Looking at all the reviews everyone said to try the Bobbie.   I'm glad I listened to all the reviews because the Bobby was a great delicious sandwich.  I'm from San Diego and just found out they have a location near my house.   WOO-HOO"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy eating at Capriottis as the sandwiches are excellent however when I went there today With someone who uses a walker, we discovered that they don't have a single table in this place that is handicapped accessible. All tables are high and unfortunately not meant for a person that can't climb up on a barstool. Capriottis should consider that some customers may need accessible seating. The star rating is is not for the food. They do have outdoor seating with regular height tables however it was windy today so we couldn't sit there and had to leave due to them NOT having handicapped accessible seating inside."}
{"text":"I love Capriottis but this is the worst location. Service is slow, the place is dirty and most times they get your order wrong.  It does not hold up to the standards you would expect from this chain"}
{"text":"My wife and I split the Caprastrami and Cole Turkey subs.  The Caprastrami was particularly good, but if you are not a fan of cole slaw, then you would probably prefer something a little more traditional.  Their signature item is named \"The Bobby\" and is made with turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing .  I will be going back to Vegas around Thanksgiving 2010, so the Bobby is definitely on my agenda."}
{"text":"CAPASTRAMI!!! You have to try this sandwich. I always get the largest one so I can eat it for three meals. The Russian dressing with slaw is so good. I also like the BOBBIE. This is a Thanksgiving dinner in hoagie form. It will definitely satisfy any hunger. The people are always so nice here and they make every sandwich fresh as you order it. Capriottis is my kind of sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Had the HOT ITALIAN SUB (Genoa salami, ham and cappicola). The meat was piled high with pickles lettuce tomatoes and mustard. It really hit the spot. You can rely on this place to satisfy any sandwich craving."}
{"text":"Deeeelicious!  Capriottis is one of my favorites and the crew at this location is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop for a chicken cheesesteak. It's my go to item every time I come here. They know what you mean when you say \"EXTRA\" cheese or peppers or mayonnaise etc. always friendly. 
I call to order usually because there is a wait for the hot sandwiches. About 10-15 minutes. But it's very worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love the capastromi cheese steak is good too! If only it fit with my everyday healthy diet. I'd be here everyday! I always get a large and eat some today n save the rest for later."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are good, I'm a fan of the Italian. Trouble is they often run out of bread at the Ft. Apache/Tropicana location often. They've lost my business on my last three visits. Best not to try at dinner time, I suppose."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited Capriotti's on the way to work and were absolutely appalled by having to wait 7 minutes for ONE sub. The employee was very friendly and smiley, but there were no other customers so there is no excuse for how long the sandwich took."}
{"text":"Love Cap's but this outlet is incredibly full of attitude & not the good kind.  Extremely unprofessional staff, place is in disarray & not cared for.  Will not return to this location, which I walk by often when staying at the Saguaro."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and it's always been great. 1 time they messed up my order with hot peppers on my sandwich instead of sweet peppers. The owner called me and wanted to make it right.
He did and comped my next meal. They now have a loyal customer. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Went to the movies and decided to take them up on their offer to make it right before I saw the flick. No one was around. No cook, no counter person. The counter person in  the food stand next door called us over to have a burger. What was I to do? It is fast food after all and nothing is slower then no one to take my order. They failed."}
{"text":"So I'm feeling all queasy and lazy... probably due to the sun or the 2 yard long cocktails I had by the pool... but I was craving a capastrami from Capriotti's! Went on yelp to find their number since their website only lists the address and no phone # (wth!?)... Saw that they deliver!!! Called the store, they said another store was actually closer to our hotel. Called that store and they said this store was closer. Called this store back and they were like \"Oh they won't do it huh?\" At this point, I felt like I didn't want to give my money to a business who didn't appreciate me. But I really wanted a capistrami!

So we placed our order over the phone, was told there's a $3 delivery charge. I'll pay you $10! cuz it'd cost $20 round trip for me if I had to cab it over. Then they asked for our delivery address... we're at Monte Carlo, room ... \"Wait you're guest at the hotel? We can't deliver to guests, only to workers, per the hotel policy\" UGH I want my sandwich!! Fine we'll come pick it up. I wanted to write a 1 star yelp review but I was too hungry to concentrate.

When we got there, the guy helping us was so apologetic and gave us a free sandwich on top of our order. And that 1-star review I originally drafted is a thing of the past. Yes I'm Asian, free stuff = more stars on yelp. But yes, their sandwiches are freaking delicious so they never deserved 1 star anyway. I was just hungry and cranky."}
{"text":"Very very good. Me and my group of 3 got two 20 inch subs. One was sausage and the other was the Italian. I preferred the sausage but both were very good.  I picked them up and then walked back to my hotel, so they werent piping hot, but that is hardly their fault. The staff was friendly my group got there right before they closed and they still made our food and didnt make you feel bad about it. I would have liked to tried the meatball sub, but they were out of meatballs. There are a few other things i would have liked to try but i live out of state."}
{"text":"So I never really had pastrami before...but I decided to try it here along with the chicken cheesesteak...both had really good flavors and the bread was good...I had no complaints...staff was nice and let me look at the menu without me feeling rushed...I now have a place to take friends if I visit Vegas again...thank you:-)"}
{"text":"A great selection of sandwiches to choose from.  They are well made, fresh, tastey and filling.  I only eat here if I'm really hungry."}
{"text":"Love their phill steak sandwich , the way you want it , i always ask with mushrooms , yummyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy and delicious we buy the 20 inch and its good for 3 of us, the employee are nice and friendly , they make the food the way you want it ,not the way they want it if you never go just order its best ."}
{"text":"I was walking by Capriotti's while visiting Olde Town and saw the \"Voted best sandwich in America\" sign and had to try it. I got the Bobbie- turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo- had them hold the mayo. This is not what I would normally order, but had to try it. I was quite pleasantly surprised. It was outstanding! I thought it would be served hot, but it was cold and I loved it! The fresh, roasted, hand carved turkey is what makes this a winner. It is not sliced, processed deli turkey. The taste of the turkey is wonderful. I wish I lived here as this would be a regular stop for me. I got the \"Capture 2\" that includes your choice of half a sub, salad and soup. I chose the balsamic chicken salad to go with my Bobbie and the salad was wonderful also. Service was fast. The price was also really good for the amount of food I received. Very generous salad and a half sub was more than enough for lunch. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"OK, so this was my first visit to ANY Capriotti's and was expecting good things. I order their \"Capastrami which is a 9\" pastrami sandwich served on a roll with Russian dressing and cole slaw. I ask to have the cole slaw served on the side instead of in the sandwich, which they did. It took them a little more than 5 minutes to prepare it. Now I have eaten enough pastrami in my life to know that good pastrami has been salt cured and has a bold spicy, smoke infused flavor. Capriotti's pastrami tasted almost totally bland. Even the saltiness had somehow been leached out of it. The sandwich roll had obviously been microwaved which results in toughening up its natural soft baked texture. The cole slaw was mediocre and not particularly flavorful.

What a HUGE disappointment! Overall, this turned out to be one of the 2 worst pastrami sandwiches I've ever been served. I know that Capriotti's has now become another big multi-state franchise chain. I don't know how they managed to achieve that status by serving such a wretched sandwich."}
{"text":"FYI: for tourists - go for good sandwich, but not for atmosphere.

I went onto yelp to look for a good diner/deli place in Vegas while I was visiting for a few days.  I saw that Cantors deli  (LA) and Carnegie deli (NYC) had clones.  I've eaten at the originals of both and loved it. Then I saw Capriotti's and it's really high ratings and the low prices.  I haven't been to a Capriotti's so I thought I'd try it. I was expecting a Cantors/Carnegie sort of place.

As soon as we got off the plane & checked into our hotel -I dragged a coworker who had never been to Vegas.  We took a $12 cab ride (for 3.5 \"Vegas blocks\") just to get there and expected a sit-down diner type place.

Our taxi driver couldn't even find it because it was a small store front in a strip mall.  We walk in and it's just a counter to order at, a couple of tables.  

I was actually quite pleased with my turkey, stuffing & cranberry sandwich. Real trukey.  Actual cranberries.  mmmm.

My coworker was NOT happy due to lack of atmosphere, no drink choices (only water or OJ) and the fact that there was really only 1 vegetarian sandwich and no salads (which she was craving).
The other patrons seemed to all be UNLV frat boys talking about drinking.  And there were people outside smoking which drifted in... ick.

So, really good sandwich,  I can see why locals love it.  For us though,  not sure it was quite worth the taxi ride, and certainly not a good introduction to someone's first time in Vegas- who's been wooed with the glamorous dining options available."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times, because of the reviews I read here. I tried the turkey sub and then the mushroom cheese steak to make sure I am giving the place a fair assessment and especially since I did not tried their specialty when I first went there. While both subs were alright, I did not find anything especially special about the food. they were alright but not what other here are rating it or saying about it. The turkey was bland and in general the sub itself was ordinary. The mushroom cheese steak was fair if not above the average chain restaurants, but again not five star or even four star. The service was alright, It is a sub shop, so I am not expecting a five star restaurant. The staff are friendly as they can be so nothing against service, but a place like this is not about service, it should be about the food.

In summary, If I was in the area and felt like a cheese steak sandwich, I would not mind stopping by. I would not go out of my way, because it is definitely not the best cheese steak ever. It is a good one that is about it. The other subs, I've only tried one other mind you, may not be that great.

First I am not from this area so I was thrilled to find a site like yelp, I use to use citysearch in Chicago and found a lot of review to be fair and accurate. I think people here though  are giving too many five and four star that it is perhaps it has become a little diluted."}
{"text":"There has been a noticeable change at this location.

Their sandwiches are much skimpier than other Capriotti's shops and from when they first opened. It doesn't feel like I am eating a signature sandwich. My last 3 orders were made wrong, even though I was specific about my condiments and garnishes. The current roster of employees don't seem particularly happy either...

I won't be back at this location for a while."}
{"text":"The Caprastrami may be the best sandwich I've ever had anywhere.

And the guys working there couldn't be any friendlier. What an awesome place!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, awesome service, great price. Open 24/7 and close to the strip. We will be back! Thank you."}
{"text":"This location is a sad version of Capriottis. I have been to this location 3 times recently and each visit deserves a bad review. Why isnt he food as good here?? Maybe because I can't get over the terrible customer service I've received all three times!!! The customer service is AWFUL. Not to mention the person making my sandwich WITH GLOVES ON, answered the phone, WITH GLOVES ON, hung up, and continued making my sandwich with the same gloves on. 
I ordered two sandwiches
After telling the guy I wanted everything listed on the menu on the sandwhich, he literally put NOTHING on it. So I got back up to the counter to ask for a side of mayo, mustard, pickles, tomatoes, etc, it takes him over 5 minutes to prepare everything and then tells me \"I'm not supposed to use these containers for sides so.....\" 
Then, he just completely forgot to make the 2nd sandwich, which left my kids waiting another 10 min. I should probably mention, IT WAS DEAD. Nobody else in line. 
I could go on 5 more paragraphs about the last experience . Like seriously management, Do something about this location, you've gotta know it sucks and until you revamp this location, I will not be coming back and I will also be warning my friends. It's really a sad excuse for a Capriottis."}
{"text":"First time having their sandwiches was at an office function... OMG! Hands down the best I have had! LOVE the Thanksgiving leftover sub. Mouth is watering just thinking about it right now...

I only with there were more locations. But it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Always super yummy and have never had bad service in the dozen or so times I have stopped in here. The Bobby is still my favorite... Can't go wrong with turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce"}
{"text":"Great cap sandwhiches, wish they had a drive thru. Fast riendly service and they offer delivery to mall workers."}
{"text":"The Bobbi, nothing special, just a little underwhelming for a cold sandwich.  The meatball sandwich, just a flavorless sandwich.  If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today (my first visit) and ordered the Black & Bleu salad.  To begin with there was no Bleu cheese in the salad.  I returned it and got an apology for the missing cheese and received a cup full of cheese.  After sprinkling the cheese over the salad I took a bite only to bite into a piece of metal of some type.  I returned the salad along with the bite of metal and instead of getting a refund on my meal, I was offered a card for a free sandwich...... wtf:  Since this was my first experience with Capriotti's I really don't think I will return.  Too many places to get a good sandwich or salad to mess with this type of service."}
{"text":"Fantastic salad! I had the Cap's Chopped, and it was fresh and generous. My hubby had the italian sub and happily wolfed it down. \"Real good!\" Was all i got out of him. The location seems sketchy at first, but the inside is comfortable. I also see they have an app with rewards."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches! The 12 inch was plenty big enough for my hubby and I. We stopped at the Sinclairs to get gas and let the puppy out to pee. Bathrooms were very clean and there was no line. Not sure what the sandwich was called but it was like Thanksgiving on a sub. Fresh turkey (not sliced, but like leftover turkey), cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo. AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. I'm very picky and like my sandwich a specific way. Today they messed up and put hot peppers instead of just sweet peppers. I had picked the sandwich up but when I called to complain they offered to drive a replacement sandwich out to me. I was very impressed. The replacement sandwich was perfect, exactly how I like it. Thanks"}
{"text":"Every time I'm craving a big delicious sandwich I think of the capastrami best damn sandwich they have. It's nice cause it's right next door to me I always get the 20\" if I don't eat it all I eat it later. Great staff always nice when I come there."}
{"text":"I tried the Chicken Balsamic salad today it was good. I was told they had great salads, the friend who referred me always gets the BBQ salad with double chicken, they said it's a great tasting salad too. The staff was friendly, it was clean and the service was fast. I noticed when I got there that they deliver also."}
{"text":"Well what can be said that hasn't already been said about caps
Nothing I guess.The Bobbie is the best sandwich in Vegas 

All the sandwiches are top notch 
The best hot sandwich is the
 Cheese steak with hot and sweet peppers 

Call the order in to go 
They take 500 years to make one sandwich 
It's still worth it"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop in Vegas hands down. The bobby always caught my attention and appetite.  But slowly moved into the hot sandwich section. Im from Philly and I ALWAYS compare.  This is the only place I will order a cheesesteak from. Still not home. But its still very good. If you've never been try it. This Sahara location always makes my orders quick and fresh"}
{"text":"On point with other Capriottis shops in las vegas. Friendly staff and able to tweak the menu to your liking. I usually go with the philly steak with sweet and hot peppers add mushrooms and mayo.!!"}
{"text":"I always order online ahead of time... Never have I waited even if I am a couple minutes early .. Always good quality.. Love the capastrami or Bobbie!"}
{"text":"Typically I love the food here at Capriotti's but I cannot recommend it currently. The management here needs to seriously step up their game. The soda machine was broken for about two months, last week they were out of CO2 and for the last few weeks the place smells like sewage. It's strong enough to hit you as soon as you open the door and pungent enough to be gag inducing when near the soda machine or cash register. Makes me not want to eat here anymore..."}
{"text":"We received horrible rude customer service from every employee during our first visit to this sandwich shop. From ordering sandwiches, to paying, to picking up our order. Sandwiches were served on hard bread, an allergy food item was added to the sandwich then removed, but the seeds were still left behind, which then made one of our sandwiches inedible. Prices were very highUnfortunately we won't be returning to this sandwich shop location anytime soon, and we had such high hopes for a new business in our immediate area."}
{"text":"Loved it!  It was clean, service was fast & friendly and extremely helpful for being my 1st time..  The ham and cheese I had was fantastic, fresh and actually full of flavor.  It was a nice change with a whole new flavor.  I will be going back."}
{"text":"Hollllyyyyy cow! Bread is soft like subway's  but with a slightly firm outer crust that didn't leave you with a sore jaw afterwards. Meats tasted super fresh."}
{"text":"I'd just like to point out that I absolutely love Capriotti's; however, this location doesn't seem to be as consistent as their other locations around the valley. Maybe it was an off day for them? I'm not really sure.

I ordered myself a large capistrami sandwich today ($14) and was surprised at how stingy they were with the hot pastrami -- definitely not worth the price you paid for. I guess not an extreme deal breaker, but I probably will not be back at this location despite how close it is to home. Employees were friendly and service was quick -- I mean, there was no line when I came in so it had to be. 

The next time I want generous portions which Capriotti's has always been known for, I'm just going to continue trekking out to their other location between Eastern and Sunridge. 

/hangry/"}
{"text":"One of the few remaining REAL sandwich shops in America... this one in particular has a great staff that's fast & friendly. I think I may be clinically addicted to their sausage sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Screwed up my order 2 times in a row. They suck. Gas money!"}
{"text":"They are a skuzzy lot but they get the order right. The food is crap but I forget that every 3 months that I order here."}
{"text":"Awesome subs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My favorite is turkey with stuffing!! Wow, all the flavors of Thanksgiving on a delish bun of super soft bread!!! The veggie was great too but their soy turkey tasted more like tuna which I did not mind at all since I'm a huge fan of tuna."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak was yummy warm n cheesy had a bit of a wait but well worth it I would definitly go back and try other yummy sadwhichs"}
{"text":"As always very good food very fresh and hot taste great, don't mind the price for that!!"}
{"text":"We don't have these where I'm from. Too bad.  So far, all the sandwiches I've tried are uniquely delicious. These are sandwiches you won't find, and can't build, just anywhere. Go in and get one of their signature sandwiches. Come out full. Be thankful.  Say nice things.  Treat people respectfully. Make the world better."}
{"text":"This is my go to Capriotti's.  I have eaten is several around town, but this is my favorite.  The food is consistently great (as it is in most stores), but it is the service here that makes the difference.  The staff is always overly helpful and super nice.  The store is always clean and they get my food out really quickly.  

I know that it is easy to say that Capriotti's food is really, really good and this one consistently hits the mark.  You can't go wrong with any Capriotti's, but this one is my favorite."}
{"text":"Must always make a detour here every time!!

This location is open 24 hours so got two 20\" Capastrami cut in half to take home as souvenirs for friends waiting at home. That's how we roll.

A day later, heated up, still great!"}
{"text":"Although this is my FAVORITE sub place in Vegas ESP the bobby/homemade turkey sandwich! But I had to take off some stars for closing before 9 pm!! This is Las Vegas and many of us work late or crazy hours and a fast food restaurant should be open to AT LEAST 10 pm.. but we showed up at 8:30 with doors locked. Very disappointing..."}
{"text":"I got \"The Bobbie\" after a wedding reception turned into a booze fueled, late night romp through old town. Never tried the sandwich before, but it's the biggest thing on the menu. Has to be good, right? Wrong. To be fair, The guys behind the counter were professional and friendly.

It was a gamble, and a relatively safe one, so I thought. One would think the sandwich that is advertised the most, and largest on the menu, would be the tastiest, and most famous. The Bobbie has a mix of turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing. What could go wrong? It IS that time of the year, Sounds delicious. Why does food get famous? Because it is a staple of the area, and the community.

One thing is for certain, the stuffing was as dry as the desert. The cranberry sauce might has well have been pulled straight from an abandoned nuclear bunker, it was dry as fuck like the rest of the sandwich and the entire state.  The turkey...

The turkey might as well have been tuna. Absolutely disgusting. 

I'm still drunk as fuck typing this. I have eaten garbage that has tasted better, while i was less drunk than i was tonight. It was on par with leftover mystery chinese gutter trash, but worsr. I even got a second opinion from my party and passed the sandwich to 6 people. This sandwich literally made me question my own sanity. It was almost relieving that EVERYONE thought it was as dry and tasteless as the establishment that created this monstrosity.

Who takes back a fucking sandwich? Me apparently. I understand if a steak is not cooked to your liking, it's an easy mistake in a busy place, I served tables for 4 years. I get it. But a sandwich? Jesus.

The replacement sandwich I received might as well have been a homemade tuna sandwich. I ordered normal turkey. Tis the season. God damn. You would THINK that the cranberry sauce would save it, but no. God damnit. I'm drunk, any food would taste good.

Fuck Capriotti's. I would rather recommend getting your ass pillaged by butt gremlins for an eternity than eating \"The Bobbie\" once.

Complete trash. If you go there, save yourself some time and throw the sandwich in the garbage before you have the unfortunate experience of eating the food.

Fuck."}
{"text":"I've been going to Capriotti's for 2 years but tonight I had the best experience ever and I will never forget that.10**********"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches I know of.

The Capastrami is just excellent.  They make the best cheese steak I've ever had, partly because they actually offer truly hot peppers as an option (they also have mild) and partly because of the overall quality of the meat and other ingredients."}
{"text":"Ripped off today.  I ordered a couple of sandwiches, including a steak and cheese, my favorite.  So after 16 mins I realize something's wrong, especially after everyone but one person who ordered after me has left the place or are eating their meal.  My wife who is facing the counter says, the counter girl just asked about a steak and cheese.  So I get up and they magically are wrapping up my sandwich.   

I sit down and there is so little meat it's not right.  Given that they were just wrapping and the bread was cold (i.e. no heat dissipation), leads me to believe my order was lost/forgotten.  They just scrapped some steak from another order and quickly wrapped it up.   The counter person knew I was annoyed at waiting so it's not that they didn't have an opportunity to correct.

Needless to say a very bad survey and this Yelp.  Employees need to know or be taught how to handle errors and address them, not how to hide it and piss off a customer with a Yelp account."}
{"text":"I love this Capriotti's!! The food is tasty and the staff is always polite and friendly. The food is amazing and they have cookies now! I had some questions about the ingredients in some of the sandwiches due to food allergies and the manager was very helpful and nice about it. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"On one of my customers recommendations I tried this sandwich shop out. Our party went in there pretty hungry and thought we could take down any normal sandwich... I was horribly mistaken LOL. I had Philly steak on the mind and ordered a large. The wonderful staff behind the counter held up a large bread and asked me if I was sure??? I'm so glad they did it was the size of a small child LOL

I downgraded to half which was in excess of 12 possibly 14 inches long.  What made the meal and experience wonderful was the sandwich was not just large for the sake of being large.  It was absolutely delicious and I highly recommend that if you're anywhere near this place give them a try and get the Philly!"}
{"text":"We keep going back for their great sandwiches & service. ..Management, Todd Mabrey, has made it a point to get to know us, &get our feedback.   He's on top of everything and it's a treat to go to a place that welcomes you, has excellent food &service.
We applaud the management for their excellent customer service!!  It's such a refreshing change from other sandwich shops!!
We highly recommend it! !"}
{"text":"First time here and this place have good  service and the food was great, meatball sandwich is one of the best."}
{"text":"Never disappointing. The staff is always friendly and the food is not only delicious but comes out in a timely manner. I'm a big fan of the grilled Italian with hot peppers added but sometimes you just need to order a Bobbie."}
{"text":"They didn't have turkey or cranberry's on thanksgiving I was very disappointed. Not going back"}
{"text":"So I don't eat sandwiches much.

That might change.

Holy cow.  Where on earth have I been.  Thanksgiving explosion in your mouth...AKA the \"Bobbie.\"  (Turkey, Stuffing and Cranberry Sauce)

I found out it's the #1 sandwich and I have been hiding under a rock because holy amazeballs!!  My plan was to eat half of my 9\" sandwich now and half later.  FAIL.  ALL NINE INCHES IN MY MOUTH.  Sorry Yelpers.  I could not resist.  I was heaven.  No such thing as later.

I will be back for more sandwiches (on my cheat days HEE HEE)."}
{"text":"5 customers, 5 people working, 30 minute wait for a very expensive sandwich for what you get.   Very unremarkable.   I would never return."}
{"text":"I have ordered large amounts of sandwiches from caps and they are always ready to go when I get there and they help with loading everything up.

The sandwiches are really good and tend to go ever better than the typical subway...

Thanks guys"}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop ever. The Capistrami is amazing. The bobby is bomb but I suggest ordering the hot bobby. The Italian with sweet peppers mustard and oil and Vinn, ridiculous. Plenty of them al over the city. If you haven't gone go."}
{"text":"I placed an order online two weeks ago for a party tray for a Christmas Eve party and paid for it online. I called the night before I needed the items to confirm (Dec 23rd) and the gentlemen said they didn't have the order. When I told him I had a confirmation email he said \"oh you ordered it online? I have to check another computer\" he then told me he couldn't see it and it's maybe because they're out of bread. Not sure what that has to do with it. He told me the manager, Maggie, would call me in the morning. Maggie did call me and told me it would be ready for pick up. I told her my brother would be picking it up and he had all the info (confirmation, proof of purchase) my brother went to the store to pick it up and they made him pay! He had a receipt in an email and they said not sure how we had that because their system says it's not paid for. My brother paid and then they realized it was paid for. They refunded him but said they were unable to print him a receipt to show the transaction. Absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional! I called to speak to a manager and conveniently she wasn't there. All they could say was sorry. I will never go to them for catering again."}
{"text":"Veggie cheese steak is soooo delicious!!! They just opened one in Concord, not too far from my current location.  Looking forward to trying their veggie sandwiches."}
{"text":"Had a mushroom cheese steak. Normally a very tender juicy sandwich. Not this time. Tough and dry. Trainee needs more supervision and training."}
{"text":"Just had a cheese steak sandwich with grilled onions and hot peppers.  Sandwich was very good and the staff was friendly and helpful.  I think you need to be a regular to understand the process, though.  They never asked if I wanted anything other than standard stuff on the sandwich.  Wasn't clear in the process when that's supposed to occur and I didn't bother to ask.  Good thing I like everything!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome for vegetarians looking for a good patty in a sandwich. Their Veggie Cheeseburgers are awesome. Just ask them to make a good sandwich and you don't have to work on what goes inside.
They accept online orders on their website and the prices are reasonable.
The patty and stuffing makes the sandwich quite heavy so a 20 inch sandwich feeds four light eaters with ease.."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Not a place you want to eat in but you can. It's more of a take out place.

The Italian and the Capistromi sub is my favorite."}
{"text":"Mmmm.... Baby it's COLD outside but oh SO hot & YUM inside. Tiny little sandwich shop that is BIG on smiles, service & customer satisfaction. The Capistrami is RIDICULOUSLY yummy and Philly Cheese Steak was a vision of beauty ... Or so says the Pittsburgh guy. Drive by & say HI..."}
{"text":"This place always finds an excuse to not cook anything the last 30 minutes it is open. I've gotten \"my cook quit\", \"the grill broke\" and \"we ran out of bread (this one was last night, Oct 7)\" the last three times I have tried to order something between 10:30p and 10:45p in the past few months. Their sign says they close at 11pm on weeknights. Start closing at 10:30 if that is when you are going to stop taking orders.

When they actually take my order, the food is good, just as it is at other locations."}
{"text":"With all due respect's to Jarred's July 1 review, I decided to test them and place a take-out order... Bobbie with extra mayo and cranberry. When I asked, they said it would be ready in 10 minutes. So, 10 mins later my sandwich was already waiting for me, and well-made. Staff was cheerful and friendly. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Ever since I started eating here, I have never returned back to Subway. Caps is the real deal for all of you sub lovers!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering and they got my order completely wrong. They didn't put the lettuce, tomatoes, onions, salt, pepper or oregano on either sandwiches. They only gave me one order of chips when  paid for two. Wrong flavor as well. Lastly, I ordered a broccoli and cheddar bread bowl and they gave me a cup instead. I will not be ordering from this capriottis again.  Btw I'm 8 month pregnant and I was craving this food soooooo much.  I'm highly disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"a nice sub chain shop. Good value but bread could be better."}
{"text":"Horrible experience at this place today. They open at 10 AM and I was right there to order just a turkey sandwich. 25 minutes later they hadn't even started on my order and I was running late for a meeting. I canceled my order and I didn't even get a proper apology. Terrible communications and very lazy and in organized workers. There was a poor lady waiting at the counter to order for 10 minutes and they were ignoring her while  busy I guess taking care of the large catering order. What's wrong with just communicating and saying the orders going to take half an hour? Never going to come back to this location!"}
{"text":"This location is full of arrogant little pricks that seam high most of the time. I leave this rating after many visits , being underwhelmed by their attitude. They act like you should be honored to be able to give them money for a sandwich. Well they'll never get a dime of my money again."}
{"text":"4 just because I love their sandwiches . This is 2nd time that we order and our \"hot\" sandwich  wasn't hot. Other than that it's  great place, great staff ."}
{"text":"We drove  fat to come here and we just waisted our time . This place forgot to put most of the ingredients  we asked for , our sandwich was cold when we remind them to toast it . I love their food but this location is by far the worst location I had been on . The place is clean and staff is just OK."}

{"text":"this place was okay , was expecting more of a bigger menu but there wasn't enough to choose from disappointed !"}
{"text":"Very unsanitary - I would not recommend at all!  

We were shopping in downtown Scottsdale - saw the sign \"Best Sandwiches in America\" with reviews on Zagat and decided to try.

The sandwiches are ok but the biggest problem was that the place was just FILTHY!  It felt like the owners have completely abandoned their restaurant.  

After we ordered our sandwiches and were waiting to be called - we sat watching an employee throwing bags of ice on the absolutely disgusting floor over and over and over and over again - to break up the ice - and then pouring the bag into the ice machine.  Really gross!  Those bags are not tear proof.  They get little holes in the bag from the ice when you do that.  And then - when they poured the bag into the machine the bags were going into the machine.  It was really very unsanitary!  And the employee seemed really angry - pushing and slamming chairs.  It was uncomfortable.

There were crumbs and pieces of food all over the tables and on the floors.  The tables and floors felt sticky and grimey.  Nothing had been cleaned, swept, etc.  We had to wipe down a table and the chairs - to sit and eat. 

I asked for something to wrap the rest of my sandwich up, I was handed paper with sauce and pieces of meat stuck to it.  At that point, I didn't even want the rest of my sandwich.  It felt like the type of place where - if an employee dropped a piece of bread or meat on the floor - they wouldn't think anything of still using it on a customer's sandwich.  

It's a shame, we really wanted to like this place."}
{"text":"Service is very horrible, I was there on a Sunday afternoon.When I order it was no body in the line, server took my order and say it will be a minute. I set down and wait. Next thing I know is all other customers that came AFTER me already received their food, but I still waiting. After about 5 customer I ask them about my order, they were looking around my ticket and just now start to make my order. None of any employee explain to me what happened, why is everybody else getting their food before me when I'm the first one in line. At the end I didn't receive my food after almost 25 minutes. I never experienced this kind of customer service from capriottis before. It's very aggravating and unpleasant. Will not recommended to anyone. The employees need get better on their job, and probably re train as well."}
{"text":"I just ate a meatball sub there. Tasted like unseasoned ground beef with some cheap canned tomato sauce. I guess the fact that I was one of 2 people there at lunch time should have been a hint. Not only that, my small sandwiching and iced tea was more than $9.00. It's one thing to pay top dollar for a good sandwich, but to pay too much for low quality crap is insulting."}
{"text":"This is a fast food place that has slow service and bad food. The sandwiches are also very expensive and not at all worth the price; they charged me $8 for a sandwich that should not cost more than $4.My question is why go to this place when you can order a take out from any of the surrounding restaurants. The food will be way tastier, will cost almost the same and the wait time will be much smaller?"}
{"text":"Waited more than half an hour for a hot bobby that wasn't even hot. No apologies. Was only told they \"forgot.\" So lame. Also, as I was waiting for my not hot bobby to be made - I witnessed two employees making one salad. Not sure why it took two employees to make a salad, but hope it was one hell of a salad."}
{"text":"Love Capriotti's and I've always gotten stellar service at this location! Friendly staff, clean store, prompt service! My favourite sarnie is The Bobbie, so yummy and the turkey is always cooked perfect!"}
{"text":"Love this places' sandwiches. Always great. Never a bad sandwich and this place has the best staff. I get the large capistrami and get two to three meals our of it. Its a giant ruben, but better."}
{"text":"Um... best sandwich ever?

Capriotti's in Vegas is located on Sahara Ave.  I never would've thought about coming here unless I stayed near this part of the strip.  What to get here?  I loved the Capastrami, which is pastrami, coleslaw, and Russian dressing.  Amazing Russian dressing, one of the best ever.  

I tried a bit of my friend's Homemade Turkey with crushed pepper.  That crushed pepper totally made the sandwich and I actually requested some on the side for my own sandwich.  Add that crushed pepper to any sandwich, and it'll bring it to a whole different level.  Addicting!

Roast beef is incredibly flavorful.  We went back the next day and I got the Cheesesteak.  It's legit as well with thin sliced beef and great provolone.  As for hot peppers and request the crush peppers on the side to add on.  Guarantee the last bite is as good as the first.

I'm so obsessed with this place, I made up my mind to visit the location back in LA cause it's just so damn good!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwhiches! #1capastrami #2 the bobbi. Good stuff, put it in your mouth and if you're really hungry or feel like sharing get the LARGE, it's super HUGE :P. Oh yeah, download the app for punches and promos."}
{"text":"A must stop when I am in Las Vegas! 

The sandwiches are under $6 for a small, but a small is huge! Lasts me for lunch and dinner, so I consider that a bargain. 

Even though the Capastrami seems to get the most love here- and I have tried it a loved it- I prefer the Slaw Be Joe sandwich by far. Capriotti's roast beef gets missed in reviews and it is a painful under sight. It rules! It is not like roast beef cold cuts, but like actual shredded roast! SO GOOD! I get the sandwich with cole slaw and russian dressing, sub swiss for provolone and omit the mayo- the sandwich has enough with the cole slaw IMO. 

Their cheesesteaks are also bomb. I wish I liked turkey because the Bobby sandwich looks wonderful. 

I also like that they have Wise brand chips and Tastykakes- both from Philly (home of the best sandwiches in the world!) 

My last request and plea- PLEASE bring Capriotti's to Orange County, CA!"}

{"text":"This is a small, cramped Capriotti's, yet it's the closest one to center Strip and UNLV so it gets VERY busy at times, and they are not good at handling that. Waiting 30 minutes for a sandwich to get made isn't reasonable. If business is so good, maybe it's time to expand, relocate or staff up."}

{"text":"I'm so happy this Capriotti's is near my house. The staff is very nice and will take care of you. The drive thru window is very nice and fast also. This is gonna be my new spot every Friday after work."}
{"text":"I always seem to join the party a little late.  I've passed by Capriotti's dozens of times, but thought they were just another sandwich shop.  All this time I was clueless, wishing there was a place that offered faux-meat options (other than just a Boca patty), and all along there was such a place!  

So I finally went to Capriotti's last week and ordered the Vegetarian Turkey Sub, made with meatless \"turkey\".  I got a 12\" sub -- good for two meals -- and the flavors were very good.  

I'm really happy to have discovered another place where I can go for a quick, healthy, vegetarian meal. The other place I've been going, Chipotle, doesn't have faux-meat options like Capriotti's, but you can still order a quick, delicious, nutritious meal there without meat.  Anyway, it's great to have another option.  I'll make Capriotti's an occasional stop from now on, and I look forward to trying some of the other sandwiches, like the vegetarian cheesesteak, or the vegetarian cheeseburger."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews, but I HAD TO write this one after several experiences at Capriotti's.  
This review is really more about the customer service than the food.  (BTW the sandwiches are really good)
Ok, we've been to Capriotti's 3 times.  
The 1st time:
We were heading home from a doctor's appointment.  My husband had just been told that he had cancer.  We were both still reeling by the shocking news.  We just wanted to pick up some sandwiches and take them home.  
I had read some great reviews about the Brown Bag on Yelp at 16th St & Morton, so we stopped there.  My husband waited in the car while I walked into the restaurant.  The place was totally empty, so I asked the girl behind the counter if they were still open.  She was polite.  She smiled at me and she said no, they were closed.  I thanked her, walked out, got in the car and looked at the clock.  It was 2:45. The Brown Bag closes at 3pm.  Nice.  
So we drove down the street to Capriotti's at 16th St & Bethany Home and we were SO HAPPY we did!  Excellent food, outstanding service, great employees.  Vince (manager?) was especially helpful and nice.  
The 2nd time:
We stopped at Capriotti's for take out.  We ordered and then my husband realized that he forgot his wallet. (how embarrassing!!)  I couldn't believe it when Mike (manager?) told us not to worry about it.  How often does that happen?  Only Never!  
BTW- we ordered two 12\" Capistrami sandwiches (excellent!) and two bowls of clam chowder (very good) soup + a big cookie.  What really surprised me was when my husband told Mike that he didn't have his wallet with him, I noticed that they didn't even pause when making our sandwiches.  Mike simply told my husband \"don't worry about it\".  
The 3rd time:  
We ordered our sandwiches to go and we paid for them.  While we were standing there waiting, I asked my husband if he had come back and paid for our sandwiches that day he had forgotten his wallet.  (he said he hadn't - how embarrassing!!)  
So... we told Mike that we needed to settle up and pay our bill from our previous visit.  Guess what Mike's response was?  He said \"I recognize you two, you come in often and I know you;re regular customers, so it's on us\".  

No one at Capriotti's knew my husband had just been diagnosed with cancer. We didn't mention it, or talk about it while we were there.  Vince, Mike and the other people working at Capriottis didn't know us, yet they were so cool, not to mention generous.  Obviously that's just the kind of people they are.
How often do you hear about something like this happening these days?  ...Never.  
How could you Not love a place like this?  

P.S.  
My faith in humanity will be lost forever if the owners read this and discipline these people for being so gracious and kind to us.  

BTW- we stopped at the Brown Bag a few weeks later.  They get lots of great reviews so I was expecting something great.  But I really didn't care for it.  I just didn't like the decor + it's in an older strip mall with a dated 70's feel.  
This is a part of town that I'm Very familiar with and I sincerely hope the area gets the attention & money to be revived like what's happening in Uptown."}
{"text":"Had the ham and cheese and it was good but definitely not worth the nearly $7 I paid. As with most sub places, you get one tiny piece of cheese that you can't even taste. Skipping it saves a few calories!

I also got mustard and mayo, which meant my sandwich was now swimming in mustard and mayo. Next time I will ask for light mustard and mayo. 

Will go back, maybe if we get a gift card :)"}
{"text":"I don't think this place is new, but they definitely don't have their stuff together. When I go to the one in central Phoenix they have my sandwich ready by the time I fill my drink. I don't expect that but this was unbelievably slow. Wheat bread is gross here too, It looks they just got it from the grocery store."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop in Las Vegas.  They use good ingredients, no cheap bread or meat. Reasonably priced, 24hrs.  Since I drive for a living, it's very convenient.   The service on Paradise is fast and curtious....go there if you're a tourist, the locals already know about it."}
{"text":"Went outside my comfort zone and tried The Bobbie, pretty damn good. Turkey and I mean real turkey with stuffing and cranberry sauce, not my usual but damn good. The small is huge, I can barely finish it. A small town s $7.49, totally reasonable considering its HUGE. Pretty impressed. Staff was great too."}
{"text":"The portion size is huge.  The medium here is probably a larger everywhere else.  We had the a buy one get one free coupon.  We got their signature sandwich, Bobbie and the capristrami I think.  I think it's worth trying out at least once but not sure if it's a sandwich shop I want all the time."}
{"text":"I can't count how many times I have eaten here. I left Vegas a few years ago and every time I visit, I make sure I eat here at least once during my stay. You can't go wrong with a capistrami or a bobbie. Both are delicious."}
{"text":"Great service.  They were out of tuna but offered to make a batch specially.  Also they gave a free bottle of water for the extra few mins wait on the tuna.  Grilled italian was decent but would have liked if they had been able to put it on a wheat roll."}
{"text":"Horrible Management! GM will not take responsibility for his own mistakes is very rude when spoken to. He will completely ignore and interrupt you, if you try to speak to him. VERY Unprofessional!!! I was so offended by the GM's attitude that I will never go back or recommend this location until he has been fired or just gone!"}
{"text":"This capriottis well honestly they've made a few mistakes taking my orders and I've been here plenty of times. I always order a few philly cheese stakes. Though they make mistakes they go out of their way to fix it. The staff is friendly. So overall I keep coming back. The food is amazing."}
{"text":"Food came out good. Only down fall is the wait is a bit long. So come and Order with time.."}
{"text":"I love love love love love Capriotti's Sandwiches. 

When I lived in Vegas, I ate a Bobbie about once a week. Now when ever I come back to Vegas to visit family, I always pay them a visit too. 

The Bobbie has roasted turkey, mayo, cranberry sauce and stuffing on one delicious roll. It always tastes the same... delicious. 

The other sandwich I recommend is the mushroom cheese steak with hot peppers. It's amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place, if only they opened one in Downtown Phoenix!!!! The Grilled Portabella sammy and the Eggplant Parm are both amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Woo Hoo! Great sandwich I had the \"Bobbie\" my wife had the Italian with hot and sweet peppers. BIG THUMBS up on both sandwiches. The place was very clean great friendly staff and a nice patio. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night about twenty minutes before they closed. It was my first time here and I was worried they would be irriatated at the time it was going to take me to choose what I wanted to eat. The nice young man behind the counter took his time to explain \"their concept\" fresh whole roasted turkeys and roast beef! Yum! I decided to get a turkey sandwich and a cheese steak to go! Omg the turkey is amazing! If your not a total fan of mayo ask for it light! I'm sure thats how they got trained though. The cheese steak had the right amount of spices and cheese! I even took it home and didn't try it for about an hour later! Still amazing. I wouldn't hesitate to come back here its awesome! 
There is also parking in the back!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's is seriously awesome. Not just another sandwich shop, they make killer huge subs that everybody in the Las Vegas valley knows and loves. It's mostly carry-out and we've had our share of rude employees at various locations, but this is almost like going to the Soup Natzi on Seinfeld - who cares if the staff is friendly or not? The food is friggin' awesome and it's carry-out. Grab your sandwich and go!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Bit overrated and over priced. Unless it's was my only choice, probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Went with my daughter because she convinced me how good it is and she was right. I got the cheese steak with everything and I have to say it's quite tasty with a little kick. My daughter got chicken and cheese and as plain as it was, it wasn't too bad either! The employees greeted us at the door and at the registrar, very friendly people. They're very quick and efficient. I think I found a new favorite sandwich shop"}
{"text":"So I was looking for a vegetarian place that seems to be pretty decent in DT Tempe, but I didn't find it, so I started to walk around and decided to try Capriotti's.

I've seen this place several times and I always thing about what an awful location they picked. There's no parking and they have very little exposure, but oh well, who am I to question businessmen decisions?

Anyways, I was hoping to have something healthy but I ended up with the small italian sandwich. It's not small at all, it's actually a pretty good size sub.

The taste was absolutely uneventful. It seems that the ingredients are of good quality but the sub is in the dry-lame side.

A funny fact is that they use plain paper to wrap it up and they use so much paper that it would be a good source if you have to paint your room. Just invite 3 friends, get some subs and use the paper to cover your stuff and roll the walls.

The service was pretty good and the place is really nice inside (for a sub spot).

Unfortunately the food doesn't worth the bother to park, walk, etc. 

If you're around, in a hurry, on a budget (although 9 and change for a sub and a drink is not cheap), it's ok but nothing else."}
{"text":"Usually when I eat here it's almost time for them to close and it's amazing. This time I ate there for lunch and it was the worst experience ever. I won't be telling the truth if I said I'll never eat there again, I just won't eat there when Roy is there. His lack of respect, customer service and in my opinion his ability to cook isn't to the standards the other staff posses."}
{"text":"Wow after all the hype about what a great place I was really disappointed.  If this is a franchised operation than the quality control is really lacking.  Our first visit to Capriotti's and with so many other quality places I doubt if they will get us as repeat customers.  Well, here it is.  We ordered the Bobbie and the Capastrami shared it.  Both had cold bread in fact we got the impression that both sandwiches had been pre made and put in a refrigerator because the insides were also cold.  No taste at all in either.  For a company that supposedly cooks overnight you would think the turkey ingredients would look like turkey but apparently they shred it into little tiny bits.  Will not return"}
{"text":"Bobbie is the bomb! Just like thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich."}
{"text":"As much as we love Capriottis and try to support our local businesses...this place just keeps getting worse. 
Seriously so disappointed.  Every visit lately has been negative. The workers are not friendly.  We never seem to see a manager/owner. This particular day we waited for almost 30 minutes for sandwiches.
CORRECTION-45 minutes!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches! My go to is always the philly cheese steak but the Bobbie is always delicious if you're jonesin' for that thanksgiving taste."}
{"text":"I've had capriottis before in california, and when i found out there were here  to, i had to go and get some. I was not dissapointed. It is just as good here as it is in california, i tried something new with my sister, I  got the roast beef and she got the chicken cheese steak.
  The roast beef was great, the roast beef tasted like homemade. The kind of roast beef your mom or ya make at home, not the deli roast beef, though deli sliced roast beef is not bad. It was a nice change. My sister enjoyed her chicken cheese steak, both i recommend getting. Her and I will be coming back soon, friendly service to ."}
{"text":"How has one of the best sandwich joints in AZ only been reviewed 3 times!? Come on AZ Yelpers, get up on your grind, yo. 
I crave these sandwiches, i miss them, i pine over them, they haunt me at every turn. They are that good.

First visit - Cheese Steak - Oh my god, never been to philly but i hope they are this good there. The bun, the meat, the cheese, the veg; all perfect. 

Second Visit - The bobby - what... wait, a sandwich with Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing, and Mayo!? That is practically a thanksgiving leftover sandwich all year around, does it get better than that!?

Third Visit - Eggplant Parmesan - Holy crap it is the size of my head and oozing everywhere. Mhhh bready eggplant, cheese and sauce, the trifecta of tastebud tantalization. 

This place is a must for all AZ sandwich aficionados, be warned tho they are HUGE so bring a friend... if you don't have friends try showering because you probably smell."}
{"text":"Ya Think They'd Know the Menu!. Walked over from the nearby hotel to grab something quick.  Ordered the Cran' Club.  Turkey with Cranberry.  Took it to go and when I open the wrapper to eat it, I found they left off the cranberry.  Hope they read this and do something about it.  I'll let you all know."}
{"text":"I know this place is a chain and all but MY GOD are their subs delicious. Specifically this location for some reason seems to get it right every time. I have NEVER had a bad experience here! Now this location specifically is located in a great place because HUNDREDS of people pass it everday. Every lunch time, its packed. Weekends, packed, some weeknights dinner time, packed. ITS GREAT. This place is always clean, the staff is INCREDIBLY nice and super fast with making the sandwiches. My favorite? The Cole Turkey. Extremely bad for you but you know what? This place is well worth it. Great... now I'm craving it... welp! I guess it's Capriotti's time!"}
{"text":"Extra star for friendly service, but yet again there is at least 1 bone in my sandwich so far. I get that it's super fresh turkey and not deli meat, but it is such a huge liability having unseen bones in a sandwich without any sort of warning sign when ordering. 

Definitely reminded me why it's been so long since my previous visit!"}
{"text":"Pros: Pretty good sandwiches, unique menu

Cons: High quality but still fast food

Details: First of all, I like some fast food so I am not trying to make a dig but I know many Yelpers don't like it. The menu here has some neat sandwiches but I tend to get the classic Italian. The samdwhiches are pretty large. This specific location has a pretty friendly staff but can take a bit of time if there are several customers. Definitely a step above subway. There is also an app but I don't really use it."}
{"text":"Highly recommend The Bobby, this sandwich shop always has the greatest service and the food is always fresh!"}
{"text":"Great food!! The staff was very friendly and helpful.  I ordered the Bobbie which was amazing!! I would definitely eat here again when we travel to Vegas."}
{"text":"We stopped by at this sandwich shop in Vegas before we head off to LA.  I have seen this name around in LA but I never got to try but it had a lot of reviews on yelp, so we decided to give a try.  When we walked in, we were greeted right away, and the staff were very nice.  We ordered a medium capastrami sandwich and a medium hot Italian sausage sandwich and they were bigger than what I expected.  Both of them tasted pretty great and I especially liked capastrami.  The only thing is that I was under an assumption that there will be some veggies come as a base for all sandwiches (maybe because I am more familiar with subway style sandwiches) and I did not know if I needed to specially ask to add anything.  Even though I liked my italian sausage sandwiches, it was little too meaty for me since there was no veggies but just sausage and cheese.  I think it would have been perfect for those who just wanted this types of sandwiches, but personally, I prefer some veggies to add crunchiness and freshness.  However, I would definitely go back to Capriotti's Sandwich in LA when I see it in the future.   

Food: 4 stars
Service: 4 stars
Atmosphere: 3 stars
Overall Experience: 4 stars"}
{"text":"I rarely go to Capriotti's, and that's too bad, because they make a heckuva sandwich. This location is inside a gas station, so you know it's not the decor that draws the crowds; it's those delicious sandwiches.

I met my husband for lunch while he was waiting (and waiting ... and waiting) on line at the nearby DMV. We got our standard order: a meatball sandwich for him and a Bobbie for me. Both were delicious, but the Bobbie can't be beat: turkey, stuffing, and cranberries on a crunchy roll. The best part about it is the turkey. This is REAL turkey, not that pressed turkey crap that some sandwich chains use.

I'm sure all of their sandwiches are great, but I'm pretty sure there's another Bobbie in my future next time I go to Capriotti's. It's like Thanksgiving on a bun!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best cheesesteak I've ever had. Went twice in one weekend because we had to have it again and we will be back next time!"}
{"text":"We LOVE the Capistrami sandwich. Every ingredient is great, including the bread. If pastrami is your thing, try it. We like this location. Whether we order online, by phone, or in person, our order is always prepared promptly and served by a friendly crew."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here at 6:45 pm.  30 minutes to get food.  When I went back to get a refill, the soda machine was shut down.  When I inquired the dopey employee said that they are \"pre-closing\", 30 minutes before closing.  Hmmmm!  If I owned this franchise I would fire every employee who was working Sunday night, 1/29."}
{"text":"Ordered the Italian sub. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The right amount of meat and cheese, and the bread was outstanding."}
{"text":"I got the half chicken cheesesteak and black and bleu salad. Eh. It was okay. Other than adding marinara sauce at the register and after sitting for about 5 minutes being told that they were out, The Cheesecake was good. I wish I would've been told that they were out while ordering so that I could've thought about my order some more. The dressing for the salad was BOMB. It and the fried onions were the best parts. Wish it came with 2 cups of dressing bc the salad was pretty big and dry bc it only came with one. Now I just know to ask for an extra one. No biggie. Being that the roast beef is homemade, it was absolutely nothing special, and bc it wasn't special, I'm iffy about trying their homemade turkey. Maybe one day. Oh yea, and it was drowning with sweet peppers. Had to take a little more than half out. 

Customer service rocked. Nice guys. Stayed busy. They alone added an extra star."}
{"text":"I absolutely love LOVE Capriottis!!! Fast and delicious. They have an amazing vegetarian menu, which is hard to find at sandwich shops. The \"Veggie Cheesesteak\" is my favorite for all you vegetarians! It's vegan if you ask for no cheese :) Definitely get the sandwich with hot peppers for extra flavor. The Capistrami is out of this world too!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches shop, cheesesteak sandwiche was tasty and the price is just right. There are other great choices."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I shared the cole turkey with my boyfriend, and I couldn't have a dreamt of a better sandwich. The ingredients are fresh and the bread delectable. We ordered the medium and it was large enough for the two of us to split - an awesome deal! We will definitely be back and hope to try some of their other great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The staff is amazing and the food. We have been to another Capriottis around town and had some rude service once but this one is great. 
We usually get the Bobbi. It's turkey, with stuffing, mayo and cranberry sauce. Pretty much just perfect. 
So if you haven't tried it please do!"}
{"text":"He worst service ever. Forgot my order? And after another 30 minutes still no food. What is going on?"}
{"text":"Capriotti's is awesome... my favorite sub is the Cole Turkey.  It combines cole slaw and turkey with russian dressing.  Great bread.  They also are famous for their \"Bobby\" sandwich which is a sub with turkey, stuffing, cranberries, etc.  Just like a thanksgiving leftover sandwich.  They also have these great bundt cakes that are moist beyond belief!  They'll refill your soda if you ask too."}
{"text":"I've been going to various capriotti's for 10 years, yesterday my coworkers and I need to get some gas and this one was next to a gas station so we went in and we all got the Bobbi, not only was there hardly any turkey but two of our sandwiches had bones!!! Not small ones!!!"}
{"text":"Capastrami is on point and I made the mistake of going with my favorite of Meatball which was good, but missed out on trying the Bobbie, which I am disappointed in myself for not stepping outside my comfort zone. All good though because next time I am in Las Vegas I want to try The Bobbie for sure."}
{"text":"Second time here and I like it. Once is an oops, twice is a trend. No fuss no muss no hassle. Nice folks and good eats. 
What's not to like. Okay, if you're a Coke nut you may have an ish but I'm all about the Dewbish so I'm good to go. 
If Danny's working when you go in give him a fake name. He's a good sport about it. Not only that but you can tell he does damage to the menu when he's not behind the counter. Good peeps."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best Capriotti's I have ever been to. I have been going to Capriotti since I was a kid, one of my favorite places to eat at. This location is the only one I go to because the people are so good to me and the food is always great!!!"}
{"text":"This is the most unorganized Capriotti's I've ever been to. Mixed my order with someone else's and then didn't have it and the communication between the two girls in front area was basically nonexistent. Thought the free drink for a check in was great so I ordered an extra one for my guy. Went to fill them and no ice came out of their soda machine....their response. \"Then there's no ice. It's broken.\" What the heck. Get your act together."}
{"text":"Got their famous, the bobbie sandwich. Homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, homemade stuffing and mayo. Very unique and good.  Like their roast beef sandwiches better. Very good sandwich shop."}
{"text":"The food is not bad however for my first time there the manager was a turd!!  I ask for all the veggies on my sandwich  she said we don't have many so tell me which ones!!!  I'm like ok just tell me what you got I guess that bothered her  whatever so I finally said LADY JUST Give me ALL VEGGIES IN MY SANDWICH !! horrible service then the staff shows up with our food and It was not what we order !! What a hot mess !!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed! Tried to make things easy for me and my co-workers by ordering online......not the case. While ordering online I got all the way though my order typed in my information (card # name, ect.) and went to go cash out. My card was decline though i had money. They charged my account six times. a 65 dollar bill! It completely drained my account. I went in to the store and I was pretty much told to get over it and there was nothing he could do to help me. Its been four days, i called my bank and they said i needed to have capriottis call their cradit dept. and say that my money can be refunded into my account. I have been fighting with the shop on baseline over the phone to try to get them to call this number to get my money back. The manager's manager was in the back ground talking for him and would not talk to me in person \"it has nothing to do with us, tell him to call his bank\"  still nothing.. Went as far as looking up the HQ number. The lady on the line directed me to the exact person i needed to talk to and the matter should be solved by the end of the week.They had the number the whole time. all i needed was a straight answer. BTW the food wasn't even that enjoyable, If i wanted dry turkey and slaw absorbed bread i would have saved the stress and grabbed a sandwich out back at the dumpster."}
{"text":"There is only one word to describe the sandwiches here... WOW! Have been here twice in one week now (should probably not, but oh well!) my friends raved about the capastrami so picked that up as well as the slaw be joe for them. Had one bite and was extremely impressed! Today I went back alone wanting to try a cold sub the guy said Italian hands down, and it was delicious!! It's not cheap, but you definitely get your money's worth with the portion and quality of meat/veggies."}
{"text":"Love their subs.  The bread is amazing. The choices of both hot and cold subs is great. Prices are fair. 

Takes a little longer than average to get your food, but that is because it is fresh and made to order. If time is a constraint you can call ahead and have it ready when you arrive. 

Highly recommend for locals and visitors. Nothing fancy here, just a great sub and some unique combos that people love."}
{"text":"Staff needs training. They read the right sandwich and send you home with the opposite. Moron"}
{"text":"On 0t/17/18 at approximately 1100 hours, I ordered some food for pick-up at Capriotti's Sandwich Shop located at 8450 W. Sahara Las Vegas,NV. suite 116.  When I  arrived for pick of my order, a young lady, told me that she couldn't find my order.  I gave her the online confirmation number and she still had some difficulty finding my order. She finally asked someone else and my order was discovered. Pick-up was at 1200 hours.  I ordered two large bowls of chicken and noodles soup.  Also, ordered two sandwiches.  A Bobbie 20\" and a Chicken Cheese Steak 12\".  A young man who made the sandwiches and handed me a paper bag with one soup inside of it.  When I told him that wasn't correct, he said what's wrong with it.  Instead of looking at the written order, I  felt he wanted to continue to question me about what I had ordered.  I told him that I had ordered two large Chicken Soups.  Again, instead of looking at the written order, I felt he was not pleased with me for saying the order was not correct;  terrible attitude.  
In my judgement, this Capriotti's isn't orgainzed  when an order is placed online.   Also, the person making the sandwiches/food has a bad demeanor.  
Also, if you order a large bowl of soup which is $5.99, it's not, in my opinion, large.  So, don't expect it to be.  And the person making the sandwiches roiled the sandwiches so small that you think your getting a tightly rolled Cuban cigar.  The Bobbiie and Chicken Cheese Steak meat was paste too.  
These are my judgements of what took place for me and wantrd to give others this information inorder to make their own decision if one wants to use this Capriotti's Sandwich Shop location. I'm sure most Capriotti's Sandwich Shops are not like this one.  My opinion is to think twice about ordering from this location.

{"text":"Oh Capriotti's make your way across the Pacific Ocean so I can eat a Capastrami again!!

Being in Las Vegas and craving for a solid pastrami sammie I ask Elite Bruddah Nelson Q. for the go to place. I already have been to Rocco's Deli (another suggested place by Nelson) and wanting to try something a little different Capriotti's was my choice.
We arrived to a clean small eatery with a simple menu, the smallest Sub is a 9 inch.

*This ain't no Subway...Not By Far!*"}
{"text":"I have frequented Cap's in several states and I love the food.  This locations service is lacking.  

1st attempt - delivery driver was out sick, ok, order to go. After 20 min, I arrive to my order not complete.  I then receive my sandwich and get it home, they got my order wrong.  How do you mess up an order - add everything except hot peppers?  They charged me for everything.   I was the only one in the store, so they weren't busy.  Oh well, I still enjoyed my sandwich.

2nd attempt - another call for delivery.  The representative on the phone didn't know if they delivered ( it's in giant letters across the window.) So the \"manager\" gets on saying they have a min order, which was different from previous attempts I have made, when questioned about the increase he stated that the policy was changed 2 years ago.  Followed by he started a few months ago.  When I then asked how did he know the policy changed years ago having just started, he seemed befuddled by someone calling him on the misinformation.

Regardless I proceeded with my order at an alternate location.

To sum everything up: Great food, horrible service..."}
{"text":"NOMNOMNOM!!!! WOW what a great sandwich! Loved the turkey with cranberry sauce. yummy! These places are a chain and they are all over town, but the food and concept are holding up. The sandwiches are big and there are a few chairs sometimes in these places. Not fancy at all but really really good!"}
{"text":"Jordan was so rude. Worst customer service I have ever received! After he blamed me for their mistake, he told me \"you're here all the time, you know how I am\" which was odd since I had never been to this location and I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the capastrami, thought I could only get them on the east coast, but now that I found one down the street from my house...  I'm really gonna have to restrain myself from indulging in that sandwich everyday!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of delicious but healthy sandwiches and Capriotti's fits the bill. We ordered the famous Bobbie sandwich and, boy, it isn't just huge but the whole sandwich is more than enough for three people! This sub is made of homemade bread, homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, delish stuffing, and Mayo! The sandwich is totally amazing!"}
{"text":"Newer shop with the same great taste. The only possible downside is that they didn't have the garlic and onion chips when we went in. Great service, great sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This location is a disaster!!! How do you not understand extra mayo!?!?  

We even emphasised that we never get extra mayo on our sandwiches despite asking. Cashier assured us she would make sure there was extra.  

I asked that the large sand which I ordered be cut in 4 pieces.... That didn't happen

Asked & paid for sweet and hot peppers but never received them.

Drove home to complete disappointment. Fiancé was exhausted from working the AM shift so I told him stay home I will run it back. 

Ughhhhhh so pissed off. 

But ezaet least when I got here they offered me a free large sandwichfor next time and got to work on correcting and making me a new order. 

I feel like she wrote the everything I said down, but either the staff cooking is illiterate or just don't follow instructions. Either way highly disappointed. 

If we weren't starving, and didn't have the kids with us maybe I would be less inflamed but lugging around newborn and 19month old isn't easy, so when I order to go I am paying them for connivence  and customer service... If both are lacking why pay them when I can pay someone else to do the job!?! 

Anyways since they rectified the situation and were not defensive, I can't give them less than four star. I have strict principles about rating places, if they rectify without hassle I will give them 3-4star."}
{"text":"I love me a Capriotti's cheese steak. Best one around in my opinion.

I also think feedback is important to keep standards up. 

But this location just seems to struggle more often than not. I ordered a cheese steak with mushrooms, onions, and easy mild/Hot peppers. The is always my order. Then I hope it comes that way. Typically they mostly fail to CHOP the ingredients and you end up with long two inch strands of peppers. I like a more almost ground beef  type of chopped up result. And half of the time they nail it.

Today I waited a bit longer than usual, which is fine, there was s huge take out order ahead of me. but when my sandwich came out the peppers were in long pieces and contained .... a pickle lol. Um, no. The guy typed pickle somehow. On a cheese steak?

To their credit they immediately remedied the issue with a fresh new sammy, perfectly fine chopped this time, it was delicious. And thank you to the staff this day for correcting it. 

So why two stars? because it's often a gamble here. not the end of the world stuff but my buddy's  eat here too and all have similar comments of inconsistency regardless of time of day and regardless of who's working. In fact, in the past, I walked in to find  the place closing up 30 minutes to an hour before closing time. ??????  So weird...,perhaps the building is cursed?  

I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble. 

And I'll keep eating here, it's just so damn good. It just needs to tighten up the loose ends a bit."}

It's pretty much designed to hustle you the second you get off the plane (see the slot machines in the McCarran airport terminal) - it's at least 20 on a taxi to get from the airport to your hotel, and each/every hotel casino on the strip offers all sorts of services...as long as you are willing to pony up, and even then, the results can be mediocre (every buffet joint on the strip is a different variation of meh).  The locals (unless they party) pretty much avoid the strip due to its exorbitant cost and bullshit.  So, what does the frugal intelligent traveler do?  Well, you rent a car (not that expensive if you comparison shop), plot stuff on the GPS and go to the joints on the side streets away from the ridiculousness.  It also helps if you have a local who can tell you where to go to get better bang for the buck.  For example - Capriotti's.  

Capriotti's is a medium size regional sandwich joint based in Wilmington, Delaware, somewhat similar to Jersey Mike's.  They used to have stores in the South Jersey metroburbs outside Philly, and at least one location in DC (Joe Biden used to buy subs to bring back to the White House), but they mostly closed down for various reasons.  Nowadays it's  within the upper reaches of Delmarva, and some stores that are running up against Wawa/Sheetz in Northeastern PA.  Their focus area is Northern California (their franchisee in the Inland Empire closed a bunch of stores), and of course Vegas, which features at least 7 stores that are owned directly by the corporate parent.  This one on Sahara Blvd is about the closest it'll get to the strip, walkable from SLS Las Vegas and the Monorail stop.  

Their claim to fame is the Bobbie, which is essentially taking your Thanksgiving leftovers and jamming it onto a hoagie roll.  Great idea as long as you plan to take a nap afterwards.  My interest is a decently priced quality Italian hoagie that me and the missus can munch on during our flat-out high speed burn through the frantic oblivion of Baker, Barstow and Berdoo (aka Southbound on Interstate 15), and as Uncle Duke can tell you, you can't stop for food there, it's bat country.  So, how did Capriotti's do in that regard?  

Pretty good - one of my pet peeves with Italian sandwiches (at least when it came to New York joints) is the sandwich-maker's propensity to douse it up with oil, vinegar and herbs, making it a soggy mess.  Then there is the eternal question of the quality of the cold cuts - is it cold and taste like it was freshly sliced off the machine?  Also, the entire thing should work well together, as in, if you are going to provide a bunch of relatively soft cuts of meat, make the hoagie roll chewy and correspondingly soft enough to sink your teeth into, as there is nothing more frustrating than to gnaw on a decent set of cold cuts and tomatoes, and then run into a bun that require the jaws of life to cut through.  So the version that I had was clearly freshly made -  I waited almost 10 minutes for it, and the sandwich maker did not prompt me for the fixins', while the place was clean the service was just merely passable.  The sandwich was neatly packaged, the cold cuts were cold and fresh, and while it has tang of the dressing, it was applied with restraint and discipline, yielding a flavorful but toothsome product that did not fall apart with each encompassing bite.  All this was surprising for a medium sized sandwich shared amongst me and the missus at around $11.  I mean, granted, I was hoping for something better than just a sub, but the Singaporean chicken place nearby was closed for renovations, the kosher tax on the Israeli falafel joint was a bit much, and I need to get to LA before the Friday freeway traffic kicked in, and for that, Capriotti's delivered."}
{"text":"Went here last weekend for the first time and I am hooked. Excellent service the Manager was friendly and down to earth. Received our meals fresh (cooked right in front of us) and they were delicious! I got a Cheese Steak with sweet peppers on it (not spicy), it was heaven, & it was such a large portion I had to save some for later! Definitely will be returning there again and again!"}
{"text":"Beer Money! I fist pump when they yell it. I waver between the capistrami and the Bobbie, depends on my mood. If you like a thnksgiving sandwich with real turkey , do the Bobbie . 

They do have Wise brand chips, which my friends liked, they were raised in PA, so to find east coast products on the wesside, is a nice touch."}
{"text":"When I lived in Vegas this was THE spot for sandwiches. Period. Easily the best deli in Las Vegas. Easily. There are actually a lot of imitators, Port a sub, blah blah blah. Cap's is the best. I always recommend and they never let me down. Couple of things though... Sometimes they run out of bread which I thought was kinda ghetto.  Its expensive (for a deli) and there's no space to eat. Just one long skinny wall \"table\". But whatever, I like the subs but also love ordering two tuna sandwiches light onion. Yum... my stomach is growling.

CLIFFNOTES: If you like subs or deli's EAT AT CAP's!
ps: I damn near wanna give them 5 stars...Almost"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches...best service.. and they are quick. I've been here twice so far. My dad introduced this place to me about a year ago. We love Italian subs. I love being greeted and served by their staff. They seem to enjoy what they do. Always makes me smile."}
{"text":"Love Caps, and this location is clean and fast. I think people forget it's here, so I've never seen it too crowded."}
{"text":"The Capistrami is the best thing ever.  Hot pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw and a russian dressing.  I'm addicted to this sandwich, but of course, there are worse vices.  This sandwich screams 'eat me' even when I'm completely full.  It's okay, the pain I feel later is justified by how amazing it tasted earlier.  They have a good selection of chips and also make fresh baked cookies.  Service is on par.  Love it.  If I had to pick one gripe, the bread could probably be a little bit better, but that's minor in light of how great the food is here."}
{"text":"This is a top pick for sandwiches. My favorites are the cole turkey, the Bobbie , and cheese steak.  I like this location a little more because the shop is cleaner than other locations."}
{"text":"Nothing to get overly excited about. Good sandwich. The bobby is a unique idea, but I wish it was toasted."}
{"text":"I wanted to review this location since I'd just given a less than stellar review of a different location...

The Ahwatukee store ROCKS!  I guess since I've always had really good food and service from this store, I'd come to expect the others to be just as good.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.

My usual is the chicken cheese steak w/grilled mushrooms and onions, sweet peppers on the sandwich and hot peppers on the side.  Not many places around that you can order a chicken cheese steak where the chicken is actually sliced thin like a regular cheesesteak as opposed to big hunks of dried out chicken on a sandwich.  I've never had a bad one at this location. Never.  

Like I said they are consistently good - that's why it was such a disappointment when twice at other locations the food was not as good as these guys make it here.  I don't think I'll try another location again..."}
{"text":"Meh - 

I've been to this location twice.  Each time it was sort of disappointing...  I live in Ahwatukee and that location ROCKS so maybe they could learn from them??

I called ahead and placed my order so I wouldn't have to wait.  When I arrived, there was a line so I walked up to the side of the counter where people picked up their order.  I said I'd called it and needed to pick it up, but I was directed to wait in line anyway.  Kind of disappointing since I'd called ahead.  I expected a call-in pick up line like most other places.  After waiting patiently in line, I picked up my order and ran back to the office.

As I ate my sandwich, I couldn't help be disappointed.  This was not anything like the ones I was used to getting in Ahwatukee.  I ordered my usual, the chicken cheese steak w/grilled mushrooms and onions, sweet peppers on the sandwich and hot peppers on the side.  They'd forgotten the hot peppers, not that big of a deal, but there was hardly any mushroom, onion or sweet peppers either.  The cheese was skimpy and the meat was dry and overdone.  What a bummer!  

The other time I'd visited this location was not as bad as this - but still not as good at the Ahwatukee location.  There they are always consistent with great food and service.  

This location does have a connecting bagel shop that has 6 different kinds of iced tea.  This was the saving grace of the meal - but now I am forced to sit at my desk and look at the trademarked slogan on the cup \"Extraordinary Food for those unwilling to settle!\"  Unfortunately today's meal was even less than ordinary..."}
{"text":"Try the Bobbie!!! Turkey and cranberries... It's Thanksgiving in a sandwich!!! 

The Cheese Steak is just as good...

I love this place and so will you!!!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah! Capriotti's hits the mark!  I have been eating at Capriotti's for over 4 years and it's pretty much one of my go to spots for good sandwiches that you can't get anywhere else.  I first discovered this place when I lived in Chandler.  I used to go to that location all the time and when I moved I started to come to this one on N. 16th street.  The reason why I like this place they have good size sandwiches and you can taste the difference in the quality of products.  For example, their turkey meat, isn't deli or processed, its turkey that has been slow roasting in the oven and pulled apart for your sandwich.  Everybody here has been talking about the Bobbie and yes it's a great sandwich, but the sandwich that has me coming in all the time is the..........Capastrami sandwich.  It's pastrami with coleslaw and cheese with some sort of Russian dressing.  It's amazing.  They also have really good cheese steak sandwiches.  I think this is one of the better sandwich places in all of Phoenix.  I think Capriotti's and Ike's are my two favorite sandwich joints.


Give the Capastrami, the bobbie, the italian, or the cheese steak a try.  All great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Its about $6/sandwich for a full one  The subs are great- soft bread warm and flavorful! Id def go back. Its more than subway but totally worth it! Depending on which type you order it can be a lil greasy. Whats good for take out is that all the veggies can be packaged on side so u dont get a soggy sandwich! Order the chicken!!"}
{"text":"Horrible place. I went in, ordered a Bobbie and sat down to wait for my sandwich. 30 minutes later they haven't called my name yet. There were  3 people in the dining room including myself waiting for our order. I went up to the counter and asked. Well somehow my order is missing. They couldn't find the ticket for my order.  No apologies. I just shook my head and walked away.  Never coming back here. If a store manager sees this review. Please straighten up your crew."}
{"text":"Great subs! I mean amazing and they are huge and full of fresh ingredients! I love the Italian. The only reason it gets 4 stars is the service. Very, very slow even on a slow day."}
{"text":"I've eaten at numerous Capriotti's and have rarely been disappointed so writing this review is quite upsetting!! My husband stopped in today to purchase a salad for me (turkey bbq). When received the salad it was horribly sub par. The lettuce was extremely soggy/watery and not to mention taste like it had been frozen prior or kept too cold (It had started to loose it's color and gain transparency). Being an avid salad eater I can actually attest to normally never having to throw away almost the entirety of the salad. Sad. Definitely won't be making another trip to this location...Ill take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Arrived five plus minutes before close .. wait.. wait.. wait wtf.. 3 minutes after Roxanne or some sort walks out.  She doesn't say they are closed she just looks at us.  I ask to order.  She says we closed at 11p.  

Wow!  I've been standing here for five minutes and the sandwich shop maker was here & went to ask if it was ok to make my COMPED sandwich??  So do your job cause you were not here before 11p.  I waited.  She then turns the lights OFF.  Wow!  

Also I didn't tell her that I had a comp, which means NOTHING, but I had won & wanted to tip them for 'beer money' as they happily say for my free sandwich.  Will NOT EVER be back.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"I have never been to a Capriottis before...
This one is brand new and obviously still working out a few kinks. I decided to go with the Cole Turkey. I ordered a medium, which was a mistake. It was HUGE. I ate that sandwich for two days, next time I'm going with the small size for sure. 
I had heard that they cook their turkey fresh and they absolutely do. I took a bite of my sandwich and it was real turkey meat, I even got a small bone in one of the first few bites.
The coleslaw is a bit flavorless, but OK. I do not think I would order this sandwich again, but i will be back to try their cheesesteak. 

They deliver within a two mile radius...

It's A-OK."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were great!  We had preordered and prepaid 10 sandwiches the day before, and asked that they be ready for pickup at 3:30 the next day, we accompanied our request with a $10 tip as to avoid any problem. We arrived to pick up our order at 3:30 the next day but they had just started to make them~45 mins later they were ready~ugh!!!
Super annoying to say the least."}
{"text":"Capastrami....that's all i need to say. I LOVE this sandwich. It is a beautiful symphony of flavor and texture. The salty Pastrami contrast perfectly with the sweet russian dressing, You have a mildly crusty roll mixed with the creamy/crispy coleslaw. And the melted swiss is always a great touch. Be warned, if you get the large or bigger, you WILL be legally placed in a food coma.
If pastrami isn't your thing, get the Bobbie with extra cranberry. It's like a handheld Thanksgiving train that takes your straight to Flavor Town. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service! The first time I had went to this new location I got my sandwich drove all the way home only to realize it wasn't even my sandwich it was someone else's. I had to drive back and get a new sandwich. The second time I went here my husband had called in our order. I drove all the way home only to see that both of our sandwiches had no lettuce or tomatoes on our Phillys. I checked the receipt which clearly states lettuce and tomatoes for both of our sandwiches. So my husband calls and tells the manager Aarin that our sandwiches are wrong and we're not about to drive all the way back. He said to write his name on our receipt and next sandwiches would be free with our receipt. About a week later we decided we wanted to redeem for our two free sandwiches. My husband calls in the same order and tells them about the name and receipt and the manager is working so he agreed and said ok. I drive there only for the manager to tell me that he spoke with the General Manager and he can't honor our two free sandwiches that he had originally said we would get. I was dumbfounded and I asked why he said because he personally made our sandwiches that evening and he knows for a fact that he did put lettuce and tomatoes on our sandwiches. Bold faced lied to me! I said no I swear there was no lettuce or tomatoes. He said no I swear I put them on the sandwiches and two other co workers seen me put it on the sandwiches too. I couldn't believe this guy. I can pay for my sandwich I'm not trying to get a free sandwich merely just you honoring what you said after you messed up on our $38 order. If he swears he made them correct then when my husband called he should've said something then and not promised new sandwiches because I would've drove back to the store to prove to him there was no lettuce or tomatoes on either of our sandwiches. I will NEVER go to this location again! 3rd time was the charm. I know I'm not the only one that has been effected by their poor service!"}
{"text":"Omg.. the only thing I hate about this place us that i found it on the last night of my stay in Vegas! The Vegan turkey sub was Great. I ordered a small and was suprised that their small was a footlong! Will most definetly keep them saved in my favorites."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a while & was given the worst customer service & a very messy thrown together sandwich with mustard & mayo all over the outside. I contacted corporate & let them know about my awful experience, sloppy sandwich, & messy bathrooms every time I go there & never received the call back promised. I called & contacted Nick which he said he was the store manager & apologized to come in & he would make the sandwich personally. Upon getting there I waited for approximately 20 minutes for my sandwich & then told I needed to pay for it. Nick told me he wasn't going to do anything for me. I drove 20 minutes out of my way for the poorest customer service. He said I should have let them know then which is exactly what I did! I wasn't going to drive 20 minutes out of my way for their poor customer service & a sloppy sandwich. The manager Nick is a complete asshole & a very poor manager."}
{"text":"They were wearing their RED Friday shirts. Remember Everyone Deployed, and they do. Good sandwiches and the small is plenty. The Bobbie!"}
{"text":"Quick and good quality sub place. Staff is nice, food is pretty good (if a bit overpriced for a sub) and you know everything is fresh."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were delicious. I ordered a Bobbie sandwich and my husband ordered a cheese steak sandwich. Both were delicious. The Bobbie was a cold sandwich and it tastes like Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich! The cheese steak was very flavorful as long as you add peppers and onions to it. All in all, good quick easy meal for cheap."}
{"text":"We came into Phoenix to check this place out. I had won a couple gift cards at an employee event and wanted to try them. This sandwich shop was great. We did the pick 2 deal and loved all of it  The dining area is nice and clean and the staff was really polite and patient as we figured out the menu and what we wanted as first-timers. The food didn't take too long even though they started getting pretty busy. We will be back. Nice joint!"}
{"text":"Probably everyone says this, but their The Bobbie sandwich is like a Thanksgiving meal in a sandwich, minus the pumpkin pie of course. It's amazing! They shove in a generous helping of shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing. I'm not a fan of stuffing, but when it's in this sandwich, I can't help but eat it all. The only thing that I'm not fond of is the mayo. You can request them to lessen the amount of mayo, which is what I do, but if you forget, they really pile that stuff on. So remember if you don't like mayo, you better say something. Their sandwiches comes in different sizes, I forget the actual lengths, but the medium is enough to feed 2 people with a little space for dessert, always a plus.

Also, the service here is pretty great. They are super friendly and they work together like a well oiled machine. I've never had a problem with waiting long for a sandwich, but the times I've been here, it wasn't very busy. This store recently changed locations to just a few doors down, but now it's like an actual restaurant with tables and such! When you're reminiscing about a delicious Thanksgiving feast, this sandwich will curb your cravings until Thanksgiving comes around again."}
{"text":"Favorite Sub Sandwich shop in Las Vegas.  I like their turkey & stuffing & cranberry sauce sub sandwich.   Small seating area.  Take-out is better.  Mostly good folks working behind the counter."}
{"text":"There are so many positives:

-The bread is always fresh and soft
-The order is always made in a timely fashion (I usually have my order within 30 minutes regardless of what time I order)
-I never felt stiffed on meat
-I order here regularly and I consistently get a quality product"}
{"text":"The only problem I have with this Capriotti's is their delivery. My friend wanted a sub & we were exhausted after a long day so we decided to have it delivered. Well NEVER again! We were told 30 minutes for delivery (I only live about 10 minutes away) well once about 40 minutes went by we called & was told \"the driver should be there any minute now\" after another 20 minutes I called again & was told again that the driver was on their way. I asked to speak to a manager who told me that the driver was going to be at the store in 20 minutes not to my house. Informed him that is not what we were told. All I got was a \"sorry.\" So finally the driver arrived & come to find out it wasn't even the driver. The manager sent this employee over to deliver our subs to us because the driver never showed up at the store. This person informed us that they were waiting for the driver to come & after some time went by (over an hour) they finally decided to get someone else to deliver the subs. I understand things can happen but I don't appreciate being lied to & after more then one phone call & over an hour  wait for 2 subs (after being told 30 minutes) all the manager could say was  \"sorry.\" I will never have delivery service from this store again & may not even give them my business again. It's just not O.K. in my book to lie more then once to a customer. I'd be more understanding if you were honest with me in the first place instead of lying to me & having me think my subs were going to show up any minute when your driver wasn't even @ the store."}
{"text":"Hubby and I shared a large Bobbie - it was delicous but a cold sandwich that we both expected to be warm. Anyway, it was still tastey. We went to two different locations in Vegas and both seemed to be short handed which made service a bit slow. No other complaints!"}
{"text":"Was going to give this shop another try but Halloween was not the time to go. Sign on door said closing early at 6. It was 5:20 doors locked. Went to eat nearby Asian food. Went back by store to get vehicle at 5:30 & looked in door. Employees cleaning up, yelling we're closed. I said there is other places to eat & it wasn't 6. They all were laughing. Our history here is much like this, Food is good, but if owner is not there the service is crappy & they look for ways to not work. Several times calling in an order they have been out of bread. For a town that will be by-passed soon, you better take care of your locals."}
{"text":"The Bobbie is the BEST sandwich. That's all you need to know...i just wish the parking situation wasn't so shitty for this place. meh."}
{"text":"We went in this location after being out shopping for a few hours. Before eating, I wanted to wash my hands in the ladies room. The sink didn't work at all, pressing down and shifting the faucet handle around didn't produce a drop. I had to get my husband to look in the men's room so I could go in and use that sink. The ladies room toilet paper was also leaning against the wall and they were out of seat liners, and the sink itself was dirty.
I went to the man at the counter who greeted us and told him the ladies room sink was broken and he gave me a totally blank look and said, \"oookay...\" like, \"what are you telling me for?\"
We're sitting there and at some point, a female employee came out of the kitchen and went to the restroom. Since the sink doesn't work, I though she'd go into the men's room to wash her hands too, or go back to the kitchen to wash. Nope, she left the restroom pulling her clothes together and walked into the adjoining bagel shop, where we watched her handle all the bottled drinks as she re-arranged them."}
{"text":"Tried Capriotti's for the first time this weekend in Vegas. I had just come back from the Avicii pool party thinking I was really hungry. Unfortunately I drank too much to stomach more than half of my sandwich. 

Nonetheless, the sandwiches were delicious. My boyfriend ordered the capastrami and I ordered the slaw be jo. The capastrami was pretty delicious but still on the dry side. The slaw be jo sandwich had roast beef and coleslaw. It was alright. I've had better sandwiches. The bread on both sandwiches wasn't even toasted. I may have made the mistake of not ordering \"America's favorite sandwich\" the Bobbie, but I just wasn't sure if I wanted thanksgiving in a sandwich. I will have to come back and try it again.

As for service, the guy at the register was nice enough. There were drunk people outside so he may have been irked. My only complaint was the tables inside were pretty dirty. Seemed like no one was cleaning up that day. 

Overall, food was alright."}
{"text":"The service is really bad here! We come here all the time traveling around for work. And every time we come to this location the heavier set chef is never ready we have I wait like 30 min or more for a MEATBALL sub which should take 5min tops with nobody in here and at least 3 employees! 
Come on capriottis get it together!!"}
{"text":"A couple of days ago I noticed their new sign on the side of the building that says: 'Now Delivers'. I told my husband and we called in today. 
 The guys first response: \"We usually only deliver on $50 orders but I guess we could do it for $30.\" He then told my husband 'wait a sec' then proceeded to holler back to a co-worker, \"You feel like doing any deliveries today?\". 
Excuse me??? Um, shouldn't this be an everyday thing if your establishment offers it? 
I guess he was fairly OK in attitude but seemed inconvenienced / stand-offish the whole time. 
I'm all for some companies not wanting to deliver but if you advertise it, employees should be a little more accepting of the fact they're going to have to do it. 
Furthermore if its a $50 minimum, shouldn't you mention that in your ad? I would figure you'd be fielding alot of unnecessary phone calls with such a vague listing. I don't know if it's just me but I believe there's alot of miscommunication and maybe some retraining that needs to be done at this establishment. 
On a slight up note; the delivery guy was a pretty nice and friendly guy. His co-worker needs to take notes."}
{"text":"Love the Capastrami Sandwich!! Every time I'm here I've got to get my fix!! The guys are always quick, friendly and make a great sandwich. This is the perfect example of a 5 star place, I crave it when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Went in a week ago ordered 2 Small Philly Cheesesteaks. When the sandwiches came out, the fellow behind the cash rang up the order and that's when we saw that they made up Mediums instead of Smalls. Couldn't believe what happened next ... the fellow gave back the sandwiches and told them to cut them down 2-3\" to a small size! REALLY? What happened to customer service ... sorry, our mistake - we will only charge for the Smalls. When I asked him what will happen with the cut off pieces he said they will get eaten?! I asked by whom and he laughed and said he will eat the pieces cut off. I was horrified. Got home and the sandwiches were dry ... the meat was over cooked with the edges really dried out. Threw half away. Have been coming here as long as they have been opened and always had a good experience. Not sure what has changed?! BTW ... I wrote the Corp office and never received a response! Guess bad service starts at the top."}
{"text":"If you know me, you know I LOVE sandwiches. I mean love.  Love. 

I tried the turkey on white which included lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, red peppers and jalepeno with a little mayo...the flavors were great but it was super dry. My bread was also a bit hard. My other half ordered the Capastrami and the bread was very soft with a wonderful flavor. I was jealous. Oh, if you check in you get a free large drink so that was cool. 

The inside has seating for about 14 people. The table we waited at was so wobbly we couldn't touch it without our drinks almost tipping over. 

After 21 min I had to ask them what's up with our order. In doing so I realized the customers at this location were NOT as important as all of the call in orders (note to self). The lady I asked literally walked in a circle them told me \"it'll be up soon.\" 

Uuuuh ok...6 min later our order was ready to go. 

I have a bad taste in my mouth about this location. Think I'll stick with Jersey Mikes,  jimmy johns, and firehouse over this place."}
{"text":"Still like this place a lot I just like the different combinations of sounds they make come on turkey and cranberry sauce who does that very good combo and their pastrami sandwich pretty good too as well as their Philly as a matter of fact never had a bad sandwich from here the counter people are always friendly and then get your sandwich out pretty quick highly recommend anyone because I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"This location recently opened not to long ago. It's in a busy shopping plaza & right off the 215 & Eastern.
I got a flyer in the mail for a free sandwich to use @ several locations in Vegas & chose this one cause it was on my way to work. 
Well let me tell you the friendliness of the staff there. As soon as I walked into the store I was greeted by a female who said hello to me & asked me how I was! YES, I was acknowledge!! Always a great feeling when entering a business. I showed her my flyer & she ranted what a great deal it was. I placed my order....Italian sandwich, one that I always get, very yummy!  She went over the ingredients with me to make sure of the ones I wanted, also asked me if I wanted any chips or drink. I sat down while I waited for my sandwich to be made. The store wasn't very busy when I was there. (Thursday a little after 6pm)
I didn't wait very long maybe 5 minutes if that, she offered me a bag & actually brought the sandwich over to where I was sitting ( I was taking it to go).
Capriotti's is one of my favorite sandwich shops in Vegas. The bread is always soft & they don't skimp on the fillings. I will def. visit this location again due to the fact of the location & the friendlessness of the staff there."}
{"text":"Came after a movie with my daughter, they advertise kids meal with a choice of craisins or chips; however both employees which stated to be managers refused to extend offer stating it is no longer valid. Absolutely no guest service recovery, just a straight no. Someone please take leadership and show these employees how to deal with guests appropriately. Take down any offers you aren't offering! A simple apology would have sufficed, they just haven't been trained properly."}

I get out..... go to the door and of course it was locked shes smiling of course . Very upsetting people there were already eating so why she was on the grill i dunno sure in the hell wasng making my sandwich"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of sub sandwiches, so I was excited to try this place. While I feel like the ingredients are definitely quality, the one thing I can't get past is the use of a sweet slaw as an ingredient instead of lettuce. I am not a fan of sweet coleslaw and much prefer a vinegar slaw. Even salt can't help me out. So, if you like sweet coleslaw, I think you'll really like these subs. But if not, this isn't going to thrill you."}
{"text":"Best Cheese steak ever. Service with a smile and quality meat and buns!!"}
{"text":"This place would earn a higher rating from me if they took a little care in making the sandwiches. The ingredients are of high quality, but are used inconsistently and carelessly when the sandwich is made. It is not as if I am surprised, as they are assembled by young lads and lasses who are probably making something akin to minimum wage. Speaking of which, I find it a tad odd that these youthful people call their tips \"beer money.\" Do they take the tips and wait outside a gas station, trying to convince patrons to buy them a twelver? Maybe they should call the tips \"candy money\" or whatever it is American youngins buy today. Old man rants aside, the sandwiches here are very good, and it is a great fast food option."}
{"text":"We stopped in at Capriotti's on our way through Boulder City on our way east to Texas. Based on the other Yelp reviews, I decided to try the Bobbie, while my SO went with a Philly cheesesteak. Both were excellent. 

My Bobbie was absolutely fantastic, and it is the Go-To sandwich at Capriotti's. It's a pretty simple concept: roast turkey with dressing, cranberry sauce and mayo on a hoagie roll. This sandwich, though, is very definitely greater than the sum of its parts. It tasted like the best part of the Thanksgiving feast conveniently wrapped up in a sandwich. PHENOMENAL. The very helpful young man behind the counter, James, told us that they roast 4 to 6 whole turkeys every day, just for the Bobbies, and make the dressing from scratch as well. 

I'm a huge soup aficionado, so I had to try the minestrone, too. Excellent! Flavorful, complex mix of tastes and textures, very nicely done, and served with a big chunk of fresh bread. I've never had better except at someone's home.  

My SO also complimented his Philly cheesesteak, too, and as he's a man of few words and simple tastes, there you have it. The cheesesteak is good.

When we got o the checkout, I took advantage of the Yelp checkin coupon for a free cookie. I showed James the coupon on my phone, and he said he'd never seen one before and didn't know what to do with it. He called over his colleague behind the counter, and it was new to her as well. This could have turned into a problem, but they agreed to honor the coupon for me, make notes about the situation and work it out with management later. So what could have been a problem turned into no problem at all. :-D And the cookie-brownie I shared with my SO was terrific! Really, REALLY rich and moist. Another big winner for Capriotti's!

Great food served by friendly, professional staff, good value for money spent. What else do you want? Capriotti's ROCKS!"}
{"text":"This is the second capriottis I've been to and both times I've been dissatisfied with service. The workers are not friendly at all. They look like they hate their job. I understand some jobs you hate but keep it professional when dealing with customers. The first capriottis was on Craig and MLK the guy that took my order was so rude and made me feel like I was bothering him just by walking in. I ordered a veggie burger and he told me it would take 25 mins to make so I changed my order but still had to wait 20 mins for my food. The man that came out to give me my food was nice and my food was delicious so I'm giving it 2 stars. At this location same thing, rude people not very interactive or friendly. I ordered some chicken cheese steak sandwiches and when I got home it was just chicken. The guy who took my order didn't ask me anything when ordering. The Craig location cashier asked if I wanted the peppers and all in the sandwich, this cashier didn't ask anything just what do I want, what's my name, here or to go. I love the food, when it's made right, that's the only reason I keep trying different locations. Hopefully the next one I visit is better."}
{"text":"I want to give HUUUGEEE props to this location. I came after they closed but they still opened the doors and served me. It looked like everything was almost clean even. Thats terrific customer service. Thank you again to Colton and jonathan, they were listed on the receipt."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches but the cookies are a little on the hard side."}
{"text":"First visit to Capriotti's, but I've gotta say, I was pretty impressed with their sandwich.  I had a Cheese Steak, with American cheese and asked for hot peppers. It was very good.  Loved the roll; nice and fresh. I'll be going back to try some more of their offerings."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and salads. The employees are friendly and always and I mean always get my order right-can you say that about your sandwich shop? Really gives this place a try-I know you will be happy because I am really picky about my sandwiches and my orders are always off the norm."}
{"text":"Had a really great experience at this location. The staff was really friendly upon entrance. We customized our veggie turkey sandwich with hot and sweet peppers and some other fixings. The trick is to remember what they have back there to dress your sandwich. So we got no cheese and went for the oil and Italian seasonings giving it a throwback to the Italian sub I used to get as a kid on the east coast... so it hit the spot. As it always does! We got there just about 5ish and before the dinner rush. Within 5 minutes three people walked in to order. Timing is everything. I would come back to this location if I was around and in the mood."}
{"text":"I grew up on the east coast when there were only three Capriotti's total. When I moved to Vegas... so did Cap's! It was a bit of home all the way to Vegas. So when I go into one of the many shops around the area, it always takes me back. I used to get the Italian subs growing up but in most recent years have become vegetarian, almost vegan. So when they introduced their veggie options I was excited. Being able to enjoy some of their signature sandwiches is a huge plus! This location at Town Square mall was cool. Yard house happy hour wasn't gonna happen and we beat the dinner rush and grabbed a sandwich. The staff was really nice for young adults. You know how the kids these days can be... so good customer service was a nice change! We got the veggie burger that was quite good and the cole veggie turkey. Both hit the spot. I would go to this location again. I think I'm giving it a 4 because of cleanliness. But actually don't remember anything too messy. I'm pretty strict on lobby standards. Maybe thats it."}
{"text":"First time trying here. I got the BBQ chicken salad. it was very good. i also got the Clam Chowder. The 3 star rating is primarily because of the chowder. I took a scoop of the soup and normally i really enjoy clam chowder. but this was the first time it was VERY sour. i stirred it up thinking it was just the area i scooped. so i tried again and still the same. 

i called the location to inquire and voice my concern. not sure who the person was that i spoke with but all they could really say was \"it's not supposed to be like that. what is it you want me to do?\" 

as a manager, worker or what not, what would you think would be the proper way to handle this situation? 

won't put all the locations under the same category. but i feel the situation could've been handled a lot better."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop rocks. They are a chain but consistently good no matter which one you go to."}
{"text":"The place was empty aside from 1 person ahead of me. After waiting 15minutes I got up to check on my sandwich and they just started it. Get your thumbs out your asses. That's the second time (and last) I've waited way too long to get a sandwich here. The manager was even in there with the guy cooling. She was rude and didn't even apologize when I asked for my money back. Skip this place"}
{"text":"This place sucks! First off you have to order from some disrespectful smart ass kid behind the counter \"hey boss, gotcha boss, sure thing boss\" Then the emo guy and girl making my sandwich couldn't stop their personal conversation and would actually stop in the middle of making my order to continue there conversation. No one waiting and it literally took them 20 minutes to make one sandwich. Never have I seen two people move so slow."}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero if I could. This location S U C K S. I'll stick to going to the shop on Craig and MLK. Came here the other day and the register dude seemed to have attitude for whatever reason. Didn't offer any ideas for my sandwich or anything, unlike this place Craig offers the basics in the sandwich aside from what we want to add on after. Craig location is not stingy with their meats or ingredients. Craig location actually reacts to when you give them tips. I live in the area and it sucks that this location is so bad. The company needs to hire new people or re-train the current ones. . ."}
{"text":"SO amazing!  I thought the Bobbie was good, but the other sandwiches were better!  They are huge, so try not to over-order.  The only downside was this place has no restroom!  Definitely a great sandwich!"}
{"text":"Currently sitting down waiting for our sandwiches, my mom is visiting from Hawaii. We were looking for something easy to pick up, stopped at cappriottis for a sandwich at townsquare. The women who was at the register was immediately rude, disrespectful towards my mom while we were just asking questions. She Insisted we couldn't order a sandwich a specific way because that's not how it was made! It's been a long day and if you don't want to work in customer service don't work in a place where your job is working with people on a regular basis. She smiled not even once, you clearly shouldn't have someone running your establishment who is the face of your company who has no personality. 
Thank you for letting us experience the most rude service we've received in Las Vegas by far on this family trip, all respects to Katie. 
Learn how to smile, and maybe you would increase the amount of customers walking back into your doors for a second time."}
{"text":"Came in on my lunch break and only had two people waiting in front of me, even with just two orders ahead of me waiting it took them over 15 mins to make my sandwich. I would understand if i had a large order but not just for one sandwich. Plus the staff here doesnt seem to pleased to be assist customers."}
{"text":"Not the healthiest choice, but food is great.

Only one choice of bread: a soft, white baguette

Veggie turkey sandwich: I've never had vegetarian turkey, but it tasted fairly good. It went well with the condiments and the oil and vinegar. A good, light sandwich.

Cheesesteak: We always get this with the mushrooms, all the peppers and yes, lettuce. Being asian, I guess we can't really take the all meat sandwich. Made on the spot, the sandwich is good hot with the the melted cheese and some sriracha, tapatio, and some chips.

Others: They sell bags of small, medium, and large-sized chips that I've never seen elsewhere, but are good. Slightly more oily than other chips, but taste fine. They also sell brownies and other sweets.

Service: Always greeted, fast service, cheers for beer money when receiving tips, but one negative, the guy in the front had to make a side comment about our \"preposterous\" order of adding lettuce to our cheesesteak. wutevs. people are entitled to their opinion. It's close, food is great, we still go, and we still tip."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are HUGE! Forget Subway or Togo's...
$13 for 20 inches of sandwich is a deal that can't be beat. Since I love turkey and stuffing, I had to try their signature sandwich the Bobbie. It was pretty tasty, but did they forget to heat my sandwich or is it supposed to be served cold? I found it extremely odd that a Thanksgiving-styled sandwich was not warm and piping hot!

I've also tried the tuna sandwich and the cheese steak, which you can't go wrong with! Their menu isn't super extensive, but there's enough variety that I can't wait to try more of their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"\"Voted the greatest sandwich in America\" - maybe just the meat stuff. The veggie burger was abysmal. No flavor. Bread, bland pattie, lettuce, olives and a few tomatoes when I'd asked for onion and NO tomatoes. They wrote it down as I ordered, and yet produced a sandwich that had things I didn't want and was missing things I did (dressing and onions). It's like falling for the \"Number 1 China restaurant\" signs all over again, but for a sandwich this time."}
{"text":"Called in an order to pick up.  Friendly guy took my order and told me it would be ready in 10 minutes.  Got there and there was 1 guy behind the counter who welcomed us and another guy who was looking at homemade jewelry with an older lady.  No one else was in the restaurant.  The guy behind the counter asked if he could help me and I told him I called in a pick up order.  He brought the sandwiches up to the counter and said the other guy (one talking to older lady with homemade jewelry) would have to ring me up...okay, no problem...my son and I are standing at the counter, sandwiches ready and he is still looking at homemade jewelry.  We stood there for at least 4 minutes as he kept talking to the older woman about her jewelry.  The other guy not saying a word...I speak up and say \"can you help me, I have to go\".  He looks at me like what??? I say again I need to get out of here please - he looks at me (irritated), comes over checks me out and thank you!  I always give that Capriotti's a tip when I go there.  Not this time!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm new in the neighborhood.  I've been working at my new job for last than a month.  I've eaten at Capriotti's 3 times in less than a month.  I guess we can just say thus far, I've have Capriotti's once a week for the last month.  Writing that out and reading that out loud sorta makes me feel bad at the thought of having a sub sandwich once a week.  I know better but I just can't help it.  It's that damn good!  

On my first visit, I tried the Capastrami.  Man, that sandwich is everything it says it is.  Acclaimed best seller I'm sure, it's warm, the Russian dressing and coleslaw is out of this world!  I knew I was making the right decision when a couple behind me order 2 of them in the medium sizes.  I ordered mine in small.

My second visit I tried the Cheese Steak Sub.  This was the best Cheese Steak sub I've had in Phoenix.  Reminded me so much of the Cheese Steaks we have back East.  The hot peppers, the mayo, the cheese.  It was divine!  

Today was my third visit.  I'm eating as I type this.  This time I tried the Grilled Italian Sub.  It's good, interested for sure.  I've never had an Italian Sub taste like this, then again, I've never had it Grilled.  I assumed it was going to be a regular Italian sub, toasted.  This was a little different and it had friend onions on it!  Definitely a different taste but one I would try again.  For the third time in 3 weeks, I was thoroughly satisfied.  I've been winning with every sub I picked up, I'm gonna keep this party going.  Next time I think I'm going to try a regular Italian sub or the cold turkey sub."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Capriotti's. For a while I was worried that I was addicted to their \"Bobbi\" sandwich... but  over time my addiction resolved itself and I grew to have a healthy relationship with Bobbi. We also enjoyed the Hot Italian."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and service has never been very friendly, but today it was spot on. There was a sandwich maker who made two delicious meals but 2 manager-type people as well, who were both very nice and engaging. The place was clean and our lunches were tasty."}
{"text":"It's capriotti's.  Decent sandwiches, very few good brands of chips, sterile restaurants. I'm just not totally faschnickered on this place and never have been, but it's okay. I might never crave capriotti's but I'll definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Before I begin, I do wanna say I understand it was lunch time and there will always be somewhat of a rush. There were about 3 other orders in front of me so I didn't think it was gonna be that bad. I ordered a Bobbie and a grilled cheese for my son. Tell me why it took 30 mins to get my order? I need to add that there were about 4 or 5 ppl that came in after me (no, I am not counting the call in/online orders) that got their food before us. The staff didn't really seem apologetic even after the fact I had to go and ask them what was going on. They told me they were waiting on the grilled cheese (does it really take that long to make one?). It really made me upset that my 4yr old son kept telling me how hungry he was while we waited. The food will always be great, but I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"All I can comment on is how great The Bobbie is as it is the only thing I've ever ordered because it is sandwich perfection!"}
{"text":"The meatball is good.. it didn't blow me away.. I will try the Philly Steak and the famous one (don't know the name but its their signature sandwich) next.. so well see.. Price was cool.. place was cool.. just meatballs were.. well kinda subway.. hopefully I just got the wrong sandwich.. so well try it again soon."}
{"text":"Thanks, Yelp! This was a good sandwich. I decided to break the trend here on yelp and order something other than \"The Bobbie\" or \"Capastrami\" sandwich. I went with the \"Cole Turkey\"- slow roasted, homemade turkey, provolone, russian dressing, cole slaw, & mayo- so good!

As mentioned previously, the small sub is huge. No bathrooms- visit Shell first. And the tables are back by popular demand- they even have a big sign stating as much. :)"}
{"text":"great cheesesteaks, i love it with white american cheese,onions,mushrooms,large , looks like a baseball bat!!! that suckers huge. they are located in a strip mall across the street from circus circus. best hogies, sausage sand, the bobbie sandwich is the bomb. turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, thanksgiving dinner on a roll, these people are for real!!!  from delaware, jersey,philly. the real mccoy of sandwiches. if you are down in vegas hit them up. love you guys."}
{"text":"Ten minute walk from SLS hotel off of Sahara (next to Golden Steer).

First time but not the last.
Went with the Capastrami (small) and my colleague got the Black & Blue salad.

The sandi was just the right flavor, size and price.
The salad needs more dressing..."}
{"text":"Worst Capriotti's Sandwich shop. 
I order two sandwiches and waited over 15 minutes for them. I ended up walking out. 
Would never come back."}
{"text":"If you want a great sandwich this is the place! For first timers I would recommend staying away from the turkey sandwich's because a lot of people seem to think they are \"dry\". If I ever hear complaints about this place its because its not standard as far as sandwich shops go. What I mean by this is that they don't serve your standard BLT/Turkey club like a subway or a port of sub. If your craving taste like that its best to get what hits the spot. On the other hand if you want a new taste that will blow your mind then stop by Cap's. As a constant return customer my only complaint is that they don't stay open long enough. Most locations seem to close at 7pm and they have no 24hr locations which is a bummer. I have recently discovered that the locations inside of casinos are open till 11pm which is awesome! My all time favorite sandwich here is the Capastrami. If the kinda sandwich that makes me smile every time I bite into it :) I also constantly enjoy the cheese steak and grilled Italian. I would recommend this sandwich shop to anyone who love sandwich's. I usually leave paying between $10-18 depending on what location I visit. Some locations do not offer the monster 22in sandwich's so I have to get a medium which is less."}
{"text":"Been to other Capriottis in town & this favors the least. My order is always the same & have received it consistently in other locations. My large Philly Cheese Steak did not look like a large at all. It looked deflated, squished, lacked meat and cheese. Other locations are extremely generous, taking pride in their sandwiches. This one seems to not do so. Sandwich should be divine if I'm paying $9 for it. Just saying."}
{"text":"This was my third time here. Came here for lunch today and had the Italian. It was ok. The second time, I had the Meatball. It wasn't that good. The first time, I had the Mushroom Cheesesteak. It was the best out of what I've tried so far.

The place is pretty small. There are four or five tables and a tv playing the ESPN channel. There are also some tables outside. The staff is always friendly.

I paid with my card on my first visit and their is a offer to get $3 off on your next visit if you do an online survey. I didn't get that offer on my second or third visit when I paid in cash. My buddy who paid with his card today got the offer."}
{"text":"Customers can't use the bathroom????? We pay your bills!!!! They ran out of bread last time I was here. Usually great food but........."}
{"text":"The staff at this Capriotti's is pitifully incompetent. They are rude, lazy, and easily confused. 
WARNING: Do not call an order in for delivery. They will broadcast your credit card number to the entire restaurant!  Both the worker who answered the phone, and the manager were confused by our address, to which they have delivered before & is right down the street from this location! They can't take an order, are easily confused by nearby cross-streets, and further confused about their own delivery minimums. I wouldn't dare trust them to safely prepare my food. If you really need to eat at Capriotti's, it's worth the extra drive to the Anthem location. To the owner: please get this location in order. It seriously needs your attention!"}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's sandwiches and especially appreciate that they offer vegetarian meats. Their sandwiches, though expensive, are LARGE. The medium is big enough for two meals.

I give this location three stars for several reasons:
--The restaurant was somewhat dirty when I arrived including lots of lettuce littering the kitchen. When I started taking pictures, they started sweeping.
--Normally, they are not nice, but this time I was greeted with a \"Welcome to Capriotti's.\" The new older man working there seems quite nice, but the older woman who's been there for years still needs work on her customer service skills. She is robotic when she rings up my orders (sometimes with a scowl).
--The sandwich ingredients are much skimpier at this Capriotti's than at other locations."}
{"text":"I was looking for an authentic Italian deli so I was a little disappointed, however the food was amazing so it made up for it. I will definitely visit the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I went there today to get a sandwich for me and my granddaughter.  She wanted the cheese steak and I wanted the chicken cheese steak.  When the clerk called me to the counter the other clerk said that one of the sandwiches was the wrong one.  Just in case I still unwrapped the chicken sandwich.  It was correct.  Of course when I got home my granddaughters sandwich was wrong.  It was a Bobbie.  I tried calling back but the line stayed busy.  I had to drive all the way back there to get her sandwich.  The clerk says here is your correct sandwich which was sitting on the back of the counter.  They didn't even offer to make a new sandwich.  She barely apologized that I had to drive all the way back to get the sandwich.  Of course we had to heat it up because it was now cold.  This was my second visit in the same week and the other visit wasn't that great either (won't even comment on how they do not clean the grill after every use.).   Needless to say this will be my last time at this location.  I will now have to go the Green Valley Resort location.  Never had a problem there."}
{"text":"I like their Chicken Cheese steaks but the only problem I have is that sometimes they use the pressed chicken instead of the actual chicken.  Other than that I would recommend them.  The tuna subs are the best.  They use white tuna and the rolls are always fresh.  You really can't miss with that.  Plus, they are kind of quick if you walk in and place an order."}
{"text":"Supposedly the best sandwich in Vegas... I beg to differ.

I ordered a cheese sandwich and I told them to put all the veggies on it. What I ended up with was some weird white cheese, red peppers, sweet peppers, onions and some pale iceberg lettuce. Definitely not the best sandwich around.

I paid for my group's 4 sandwiches and I was like WHAT?! when they told me how much.

NEXT!"}
{"text":"Don't let them deceive you, definitely not 24 hours. Have gone after work late at night to find the doors locked and the staff dismissive. False advertising and wasting people's time? Not a good look."}
{"text":"This is my first time at Capriotti's, the employees were somehow friendly but I felt rush making my order, I asked for a small sandwich I said it twice no cheese and I got the biggest sandwich there and with cheese when I said it twice no cheese and a 9 inch sandwich, the place it is very small and parking lot even worse very disappointed I don't think I will be back. I can't stand getting a wrong order."}
{"text":"Great first time dining experience. The staff was attentive & professional. My date got the Italian Sub. I got the chicken cheese steak sub. Both subs were delicious! The warm sub rolls were bangin'"}
{"text":"The shop is not 'aesthetically' pleasing, but Capriotti's is one of the great sandwich shops in town, for quality and price. The beef and turkey is roast on the premises. The sandwiches come in \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large\". But do not be mislead by the label of 'small', since the small is actually 20 inches. I usually am able to eat half and save the other half for the next day. Their smalls are usually $10 total. 

My personal favorites are  the \"Bobbie\" (turkey, dressing, and cranberry sauce, like Thanksgiving dinner on bread) and the Capistrami (Russian dressing, coleslaw, pastrami).  Capriotti's also has veggie varieties (i.e. turkey substitute, which tasted like cold cut turkey).  There are about four to five in the valley that I have gone to, and none of them disappoint. The one off Sahara just happens to be the closest to the Strip. The next closest to the Strip is on Maryland pkwy, near the university."}
{"text":"I love this place. I crave the capastrami wayyyy too much. I recommend you sandwich lovers to dine here. Worth it!

The service is great as well!"}
{"text":"The buffet was rediculously busy in the casino, so we sought an alternative. The sandwiches were quite good, especially for the price. It's in the food court, so don't expect pleasant ambiance, bit a relaxing lunch nonetheless."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches! Been eating at the location for 8 years. Walked in today and had to give our order 3 times.  The girl taking our order acted like she was paying attention and when she repeated the order, she had everything wrong after repeating it 3 times. Can't wait to see if the order is right.  It must have changed ownership. Can't wait! Birthday/mystery lunch!"}
{"text":"I had lunch ordered in for a business meeting 2 times.  The first time, about 3 weeks ago, the delivery was about 1 hour late, but the food was very, very good.  So I thougth to try again for another business meeting.  Again the delivery was late, but only by about 20 minutes, but this time the food was not so good.  The cheese steaks, both chicken and beef were totally lacking cheese onions and mushrooms.  And they completely left off the sweet peppers that were ordered.  And, they forgot one of the sandwiches.   The lack of organization, knowledge, and customer service when we called them was incredible.  I won't order from them again."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the cole slaw....sandwich is not to my taste. I took a friend with me the last  time and he got a stomach ache after. I'm not saying it's not good just not good to me."}
{"text":"By far the best turkey sandwiches I've eaten...EVER.  You can't go wrong with Capriotti's!

The crew at this particular location are great.  Good people....good food....good stuff!"}
{"text":"5 stars all the way! I came here yesterday and came back not just because of how amazing the cheese steak was, but also because of the amazing customer service! Outstanding!!! I had the Bobbie today. I wish I could say something different from all the other reviews but it is just like thanksgiving. It is amazing. The cranberry sauce tastes and looks homemade. The turkey has such and amazing taste that only comes from slow roasting. 

I can't say enough about this place it will now be a regular lunch stop for me!"}
{"text":"A business is only as good as its staff and the guys here are top shelf. Capriotti's has the name but I won't go to restaurants I don't feel welcomed in. They make you feel like part of the family. Being that I am in the customer service world I can truly appreciate this place. 5 stars all the way! Special shout out to DJ. Always has a friendly attitude and remembers repeat customers. Keep up the great work guys, you have a customer for life."}
{"text":"Sandwiches by this chain is always #BOOM,  but certain serving staff not so much...
There is nothing on menu I don't like and so happy to find that great sandwich place you can always count on!!"}
{"text":"Hello?!?! It's Capriotti's!

I have only been here twice but hubby swears by the Bobbie :)
I got the vegetarian cheese steak and it was yummy.

I guess why I like it sooo much was the bread. 

I'm not a big bread eater and believe me nothing is worse than that \"hurt the roof of your mouth\" bread 

:) I like theirs, it's soft :)

Someday I will try a bite of that Bobbie!!!!!"}
{"text":"I like the sandwiches & the proximity to home is appealing.

But the customer service was not the business at all. They're slow, unfriendly & very to themselves. 

The quality is what you'd expect from a chain sandwich store."}
{"text":"Poor service - the young lady that took my order seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else. I ordered the Bobbie and it was a good sandwich however I won't be going back as I find the staff rude."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up some sandwiches for myself and my coworkers. Right around lunch time so pretty busy. Though to save some time, i should have ordered it online to pick up. Benefits that its right down the street from the hospital though so quick and fast. Friendly staff. Took orders efficiently and pushed out sandwiches in a timely manner. Probably one of the more efficient Capriotti locations ive been to so far. Clean and bright interior."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich from here for the first time this evening. I got it to go. It was delicious! I had the ham and cheese. I'll definitely be back.

Location was clean and nice. Not sure what some of the other reviews are talking about when they say it was dirty. Was very clean when I was there. 

My only recommendation is that it would be nice if they'd label the sandwiches. It's always weird when you have to open the food up and dig around to determine whose it is."}
{"text":"Just got an Classic Italian Sub and it had no taste. I've always had Good subs here at this shop but today something was missing.?? Please get the the old trained staff back."}
{"text":"This place was really gross. To bad there wasn't a zero star. I got the Bobbie because I thought it was creative but it was disgusting. I pulled out a piece of hair and I got a soda. The total was like 15 bucks. It sucks. No recommendation"}
{"text":"Passing by and we decided to stop in for lunch. They say that they are voted best sandwiches in the nation. I can definitely say they are or come very close to being. The turkey is as fresh as you can imagine. We were told they actually cook two 25lb turkeys overnight and shred them first thing in the morning. Their specially is the Bobby which comes with turkey, cranberry, and stuffing....OMG it was so, so good. The manager is super nice and so is the staff. You gotta try it. Sandwiches come in several sizes including 9inch, 12inch and 20inch....more than enough for my husband and I to share.  I truly look forward to trying a different sandwich next time. 

You should try it too!"}
{"text":"Dear Capriotti's,

I love your sandwiches.  I visit Vegas over 8 times per year for business and I try to stop by once each time.  But yesterday your Slaw-b-joe gave me food poisoning.  It was an absolutely horrible night and as I am not willing to go through that again, I will no longer be visiting."}
{"text":"What happened I used to love this place? Got so so sick after eating here last night. It was a horrible experience. Last visits just not the same, obviously. Off to find a new cheese steak place, when I can stomach it."}
{"text":"I like this place and it's consistent. Not a ton of options but is worth checking out. I like it and will return"}
{"text":"Hmmm ... Philly Cheese Steaks. It is such a comfort food. 

I stayed at the Aliante Resort and ate here twice. My first sandwich was so delicious I decided the next day to order another one. The second wasn't as amazing but it still hit the spot. The sandwich is a little pricey costing me around $10. And that does not include chips or drinks. My cheap butt decided to have a cup of water instead. 

When I am back in LA, I will definitely stop by"}
{"text":"I must agree with some of the other reviewers, that the place is nice and all but the sandwiches are nothing special. I mean they are very basic, and there is nothing wrong with that, but if I want a basic sandwich I will make it myself. The reason for the poor star quantity is the fact that if I had to choose between this place and Subway, I'd choose the latter because it's cheaper and tastier - and that isn't what you want to hear if you are in the cutthroat making-sandwiches-industry. 

I truly went in here to test something new, and it was around lunch and could go for a sandwich (I mean really, when could you NOT go for a sammie.. right?!). Middle of the road. Not bad, far from amazing. I wouldn't bother. 

Service was decent though. All smiles and an interest to serve, but smiles and intentions a good sandwich does not make."}
{"text":"I like the location and typically enjoy the bobbie sandwich when visiting any Capriotti's location. With the advent of this location, the menu options expanded. Unlike other Capriotti restaurants that I am familiar with, you can get soups and salads at this location.

For lunch they offer a small sub and soup combination for around $8.50. After some shopping, we decided to dine-in and enjoy one of their soup/sandwich combination. Unfortunately, you get mostly bread with this sandwich and 3/4 of a bowl of soup for that price.  I ordered the meatball sub with clam chowder soup. I was told the meatballs are made fresh here, but I can't really tell you how they tasted as the bread and cheese smothered the two very small meatballs on the sub (see picture). The soup was good - nothing great. 

The restaurant quickly becomes dirty and the flow is not dining friendly either. I would only take away a medium or large sub. I would not dine-in and order anything else for that price, portion, or dinning environment. 

I debated a 2-star for this visit. However, since I have had amazing Bobbie sandwich to-go orders at this location, I awarded a 3-stars overall."}
{"text":"I grab a Bobbie all the time. There is nothing like Thanksgiving on a bun. I have had the Slaw B Jo too, also excellent."}
{"text":"I come once a week to get the philly cheese steak, never disappointed. Worth the 10$ and 25 min drive. 
Cheese steaks - vinnie paz"}
{"text":"I've been eating capriottis for the last 10 years and I've had no complaints ever since! My personal faves are the Bobbie and the capastrami! The Bobbie is served cold (compared to capastrami) because of the slaw and cranberries. It's a thanksgiving dinner sandwhich! The capastrami is served warm and they always kill it (good thing lol) with their home made Russian sauce!! Somewhat Sweet and tangy! Both are delicious and this place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I work in an office nearby and we order from Capriotti's several times a month.  I usually get the Philly Cheesesteak and I really enjoy it.  You can order online and they give options of different things you can add at no charge or at a very minimal charge.  Their ordering system is good, the price is acceptable and the food is very tasty.  The delivery is an extra $1, but is worth it as I would rather chop off my own arm than drive around this area at lunch time.  Okay, that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much.  We'll be ordering from them again in the next week or so, I'm sure."}
{"text":"This is my first time here. I had the Bobbie it was as good as advertised. This is a small place there are no internal restrooms. My recommendation would be to use takeout.  I will visit again on my next trip to Henderson."}
{"text":"There's only one thing to say, the Bobby is Awesome!! Best  sandwich in town!!"}
{"text":"Lazy *ss cashier that constantly has a blank stare on his face. You spend $20 on two sandwiches and they still forget to put on the mayo, msutard, oil, and vinegar...smfh. Dumbest cashier of the century."}
{"text":"#1 reason why I love this place.... *drumroll* They have the most delicioius vegetarian sandwiches! And I don't mean just bread and a bunch of veggies, but they have a delicious meatless \"turkey\" which tastes like the real thing, but it's been so long I don't remember what the real thing tastes like anymore. Anyway, very very good hearty sandwiches. Definitely try this place out if you're in a mood for a good sandwich, oh and I guess the real meat ones are supposed to be good too, ha. Try this place!"}
{"text":"After two recent visits it's safe to say that I am fan of this Capriotti's location.  The past visits I have arrived just on the cusp of the dinner witching hour.  A little busy both times, but everything seems to rolls right along.

Been slow carbing it as of late.  Both times have not been cheat days, so I have to settle for a salad.  Settle seems like a harsh word.  It's not settling at all because the \"Black & Blue\" is awesome!  Roast beef, fried onions, gorgonzola cheese and dressing....it's tasty and leaves me satisfied. The GF gets a delicious \"Bobby,\"  turkey, cranberry, stuffing?!  The nibble I experienced on several occasions make me want to add this to the cheat day list.

As previously stated, the staff is efficient and for the most part friendly.  When I am in this neck of the woods, and the conditions are right for a visit....I will."}
{"text":"Sarah and I liked what we saw when we had to get out for some air and find makeup sponges for my costume. Walking across the street from The Hard Rock Hotel we saw that there was the perfect strip mall (if such a thing exists). 

We're talkin' a pizza shop, cheesesteaks, sushi, Indian, and a liquor store and pharmacy! All in one small, clean, and easy to access strip mall! 

Way cool. 

Anyway had to try the Capriotti's and well... liked the peppers, but other than that, gonna say the steak was slightly better than a-ok. No wow, or holy shit. More like, it'll do in a pinch..."}
{"text":"I come in to this location all the time, I live very close to it. I am on the rewards program. So today I went in to redeem a free sub I earned from going there often. There was a couple in front of me giving the order to the cashier and I notice he was rude to them he was rushing them he wouldn't give them eye contact and not even a forced smile. The couple didn't really care about it they just went along with it!  Anyway it was my turn so  I let the cashier know that I was redeeming my free sub and handed him my phone to show him. So he looked at it and and touched the redeem button...took him two tries because he didn't do it right the first time. But there is another window that pops up saying \"are you sure you want to redeem yes or no \" so you have to hit yes to proceed, he didn't do it so I saw it and did it for him I am an honest guy. Then the cashier very rudely and waving his hands with a rushing motion said to be come on come on make your phone redeem that!  So I showed him my phone and I said I did here look!  He saw it, then I called him out on what he just did. I told him to calm down that I did it for him and that he doesn't need to be rude about it. I said change your attitude and give good customer service!  He was starting to say that the store was his and he that he knew what customer service was. I said no you don't take your sandwich and you know the rest!  I will never go back and I will let everyone I know about it. You should never treat a regular or any other customer that way. I wish you could do 0 stars but you can't."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Capriotti's! My two personal favorite sandwiches are Capastrami (which is pastrami Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and cole slaw). Then the Bobbie which is ( Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo). Both are incredibly good i always have a hard time deciding between the two when i go. The service has always been good, and they make their sandwiches very quickly. They do a great job. The restaurant  is always clean and same with their bathrooms. I love this place! The only thing i wish changed was their prices. They are a little pricy for what you get but their food does outweigh their price, at least for me."}
{"text":"The Bobby is to die for. Medium was so big that two people got full off of it. Salad was fresh and did not use any frozen ingredients."}
{"text":"Cap is a classic! They sandwiches are always super good. Never fails and super filling!!! Their cheesesteak sandwiches are bomb!"}
{"text":"One of the better locations. The manger Anthony is so friendly and personable. I get the chicken cheesesteak with hots and sweets. Soooo good!!"}
{"text":"Im hosting a party and ordered $70 worth of sandwiches... get home and they are all wrong... no cranberry means extra cranberry to this girl... im so pissed.. never never ever again... you guys just completely ruined my day... this incompetent girl who took the order needs to be taught how to take an order check it and give the customer what they asked for..."}
{"text":"First time visit, referred to me by my Nephew.  Both of us, really like food,.  This is the best sandwich I have add,  I got the Hot Italian, and it was a great hot oven grinder.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"My office moved to the area so I was driving around and saw the sign \" Best Sandwich....\" Um, no. If you want, I can come in there and show you how to cook a Chicken Cheese steak. First, don't wrap it up and let the sandwich sweat and make the bun soft and chewy. Second, put some meat on there. It was 50% bun.  It should be toasted and crunchy. And price, a 12\" chicken cheese chips and drink was $13..are you kidding me. For that price, I was hoping for the best I ever had. Change it up Capriottis or the word will get out and it will all be over in this very tough market."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Capriottis at the Sante Fe Station Casino a few times. A few months back, when ordering a turkey sandwich, not the sub, but the sandwich, I was delighted by a real deli sized meal. Last week, when I ordered a tuna sandwich it was more like a bread and tomato sandwich with maybe 2 oz. of tuna. It was pathetic. It was like a \"tuna spray\" for flavoring. So last night I ordered the turkey - and again, same lousy experience. It was as if someone sprinkled turkey like a pizza topping on it. Maybe 2 oz on the entire sandwich. I had to scrape it off the huge roll so I could taste it at all. Bad experience again. No more Capriottis for me - there's too much excellent competition out there with Firehouse subs and others."}
{"text":"I went with a buddy who swears by the cheesesteaks. I opted for a turkey sandwich with coleslaw and swiss. I will say I was impressed that they roast whole turkeys here for the sandwicehs, so no thin processed turkey on teh sandwich. I would prefer if they baked their own bread, but that's not a huge deal. I ordered the \"small\" sandwich, that was stil huge! all in all, good turkey sandwich"}
{"text":"First time at this location great service got my quirky order right and the food at this particular chain is amazing"}
{"text":"So, I was hoping that my first visit wasn't a fluke. I came back to try another sandwich at Capriotti's and found it to be just as awesome as it was the first time I came here. I will always make it a point to stop here when I'm in this area because their sandwiches are awesome and the people are really cool and nice"}
{"text":"Went here last week and had a capastrami sandwich on the recommendation of a friend. It was really good and the people were very cool. Something about good pastrami and coleslaw with Russian dressing that is just awesome. There are alot of nice choices in this part of Scottsdale and this place will be one of my favorites."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Capriotti's in Las Vegas!! Tonight, I went into this store to order a hot capastrami and was told they were out of pastrami.  I find that hard to believe!!  After asking about other hot sandwiches, I realized why I couldn't have a hot sandwich.  They were cleaning the grill and they did not want to grill anymore hot sandwiches for the night.  They were basically closing the grill down at 7:50 pm and the store was not closing until 9:00pm.  Doesn't this seem a little early to close the grill down?? So if you want a hot sandwich you better show up early!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a Brooklyn born, northern Jersey raised 35-year-old that craves good italian hoagies/subs on a regular basis.  I'm a long ways from home and was happy to have found a place close enough to what I remembered back in the good ol' days!!!

I ordered the capastrami and my wife ordered italian sub.  First positive note is that the sizes of the sandwiches are great for the prices charged.  Unfortunately, I was looking forward to a good pastrami sub, but the one I ordered fell short.  It is a good sandwich, but not what I was used to.  The wife's italian sub however, was delicious.  It was so good that I had to steal a few bites here and there.  

BOTTOM LINE - We'll be going back for seconds but may only stick with the cold subs."}
{"text":"Caps makes great sandwiches. Love the cheesesteak and the Bobbie. This location has more amenities than others. Sandwiches are more expensive here."}
{"text":"I am basically writing this on behalf of my visiting son who saw Capriotti's and wanted a sandwich.  I had already felt that this place was falling down in its standards as you can read in my prior review.  Regardless of my opinion, my son ordered the soup and half sandwich \"special\" for $8 and some change.  I don't think this is such a special but hey, it's his money.  
He had the white clam chowder ( white one) and 1/2 of the Bobbie which is basically Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  He liked the soup but the sandwich was super dry, especially the \"stuffing\"--it was literally falling out of the sandwich in little balls.  I tasted it and yes indeed, super dry.  If it had been me, I would have walked back to the counter and returned it.  My son is not a \"returner\" so instead, he scooped some of the soup and put it inside the sandwich to add some moistness.  This sandwich is supposed to be Capriotti's best seller.  How could it be so bad?  So dry.  An insult as a sandwich.  I felt terrible that he paid what he did for this sandwich.  Money wasted and in this economy that is hurtful.
The young lady behind the counter was not friendly at all when I asked her to wrap up the second half of my sandwich to go.  Not friendly.  Used to be different."}
{"text":"Holy crap!!!!  This place is amazing!   We came here to the second location just off the strip, across from the Hard Rock.  It is seriously the best sub type sandwich I've ever had in my life.  I got the Slaw Be Jo with home made roast beef (ridiculously awesome), cole slaw, provolone and italian dressing.  It's a huge amount of food for a really good price and literally the best sub sandwich I've ever had.  It was so good that in Vegas -one of the new food capitals of the world - we went back twice in two days.

Capriottis is now a must visit first time we get in Vegas and stop by on the way home to pick up some food on the way home.  I can also confirm that Slaw Be Jo holds up on the way home to San Diego from Vegas and the next day after.  

GO HERE WHEN YOU'RE IN VEGAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What kind of manager lets a sandwich shop run out of bread with 2 hours left to be open.   So...I decide to still get a salad for my gf...but there out of carrots and bacon bits.  Can this shop actually complete a single order requested.  First and last time I visit this shop.  Looks like it's back to Subway!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to eat after a night of bar hoping.....Great food! Great service! Screw a foot long I believe these guys make \"12\" foot long sandwiches. The service was fast and made to order....."}
{"text":"Love the Bobbie and the cookies at the counter are awesome! Great service even as a crazy guy came in causing trouble."}
{"text":"We have gotten sandwiches to go on four occasions and it's been great! I have had the Capastrami, the Bobbi and the cheesesteak and they all rock! Oh ha I had the Italian once also but it wasn't as good as the first three mentioned."}
{"text":"Amazing! Yes it's a sandwich shop but very different taste than places like subway. It's a nice change :) Italian sub is my favorite."}
{"text":"In Vegas for 3 days, ate here twice and took 2 home! The Capistrami is outstanding! We also had  the Slaw Be Jo I think it was called? The meat was a bit dry, but the Capistrami and the service made up for it!!!"}
{"text":"best sandwich in the nation!  capastrami is a must try!  although, i heard the bobbie is a favorite but it wasn't for me...maybe cause it was cold?  and i'm a warm/hot sandwich kind of person...bonus, throw some chips in and make it all better."}
{"text":"We needed some sandwiches for a nice picnic and Capriotti's was the right choice. They have some interesting sandwiches like the Bobbie with turkey, cranberries, and stuffing. I do find that salt and extra pepper are appropriate additions but knowing that, means we're good to go!

Our picnic at Red Rock was a great and filling success!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I ordered my eggplant parm sandwich....but it was just disappointing :( There was hardly any sauce on it, the eggplant was overcooked...parts were crunchy and parts were tough and chewy like a tire. The bread was soggy and tasteless....I love subs, and I don't think I'll go back to one of these again..there are too many better places to go."}
{"text":"Get your food to go. The sandwiches are great. We tried the capastrami and the homemade turkey. Great tasting meat and bread but not a place I would want to stick around. The \"dining room\" feels dirty and cramped."}
{"text":"Really unique sandwich shop in Las Vegas!!! They have a sandwich called the Bobby, it's pretty much thanksgiving dinner on a sub... Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo... Pretty cool place, I'd recommend it to anyone in Vegas area."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best sandwiches in Vegas, hands down! Don't forget to order the cappastrami!"}
{"text":"Man, has this place really went downhill. They must be focusing all of the efforts on their new location downtown. They have apparently left the business in the hands of 15 year old dudes who reek of weed and are so stoned they can't even speak to ask you your order. The kid who made my sandwich the other day had the most disgusting filthy fingernails I've ever seen. Thank god he wore gloves, but that's still nasty. 

Speaking of nasty, the store looks like it's going to fall apart.  It's dirty and outdated. 

This used to be my go to sandwich shop because I'm from Philly and they made a half way decent cheesesteak. But the last one was nasty and full of gristle.  

Miss how great this place used to be. It's a shame. 

UPDATE - It gets worse. I called a few weeks back on a Friday evening at around 6:00pm. The kid who answered the phone informed me that my sandwich could not be made because they were out of rolls. A sandwich shop that doesn't have any rolls!!!  What poor planning and management."}
{"text":"Wife went there to pick up an order.  As she entered she was greeted by people exiting who said 'good luck' to her. She waited aver five minutes and no one came out of the back."}
{"text":"Night time came and I had a hankering for a salad.  Not having the proper salad fixings, I thought I would pay this new Capriottis's a visit.  Called in my order for a \"Black & Bleu.\"  This beauty contains mixed salad with roast beef, gorgonzola crumbles, sweet peppers, tomatoes, and fried onions.  This all comes with just the right amount of gorgonzola vinaigrette for a proper dosing.  I was advised this location has a pick-up window. Great!  I don't even have to get out of my vehicle.

Rolled in and quickly called an audible.  I figured I would park and get out to check out the inside.  It was bright and shiny.  Open and spacious, there is plenty of room to handle any sort of meal rush.

Service was polite and friendly.  

Kind of weird to be so up on the salad at a sandwich shop.  I avoid bread as much as I can no days, but still give myself a glorious cheat day.  Cheat day or not....I am adding this location to my list of dining options."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I loved our neighborhood Capriotti shop in Henderson NV. However the black and blue salad was MISSING the blue cheese! Got the order to go and did not know they forgot the blue cheese until we were home.  I will return but will check the order thoroughly before paying and leaving the shop."}
{"text":"Normally the sandwiches I get are good but not today. 
1-had to stop the guy putting onions on it when I ordered no onions
2-Ordered oil and vinegar which he left off
3-The roast beef was so dried up it was like beef jerky. 
4- the bread was very dry
5- asked for mayo but could barely find it on the sandwich

Last time there before today I ordered on line. There is a box where you can write notes to the person making your sub. Both sandwiches I ordered, they left of all of the thing written in the box

Need to get your act together. Too bad, first two time there the end product was very good"}
{"text":"Great Sandwich shop, been to this location on the last 2 trips to Vegas. Great value . lots of meat on sandwiches, Excellent service both times , especially  from Dawn . we Need Capriottis in Los Angeles !!!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches, packed with so much meaty goodness.
The Bobbie, just like everyone has said, is your Thanksgiving Day everyday sandwich.  Turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce... I just need some mashed potatoes and gravy and it would be even better.
The Capastrami is a second favorite.  Really fresh and grilled pastrami adorns this sandwich.  Splurge a little bit and ask for extra cheese."}
{"text":"I have been on hold to make a pick up order for over 15 mins and still no one but they just sat the phone down and had a great conversation together I love the customer service then some nimrod got on the phone and asked if we needed something I wasn't hungry at that time after having to wait when I wanted to make a pick up order so I didn't have to wait  so I let him know how  unsatisfied I was and he didn't really Seam to care that he just had us on hold for 15 mins with no reasoning... very sad to have a good sandwich place with So shity of workers"}
{"text":"OMg.  The Capastrami.  Just typing it makes my mouth water.

The Capastrami IS SO GOOD!  My friends were TOTALLY RAVING about it, and usually when my friends overhype things it will ruin the experience for me.  But no.  This is ONE OF THE FEW times that I could not even begin to understand how awesome it would be.  

Coleslaw in a pastrami sandwich?? I know, I know, it sounds strange.  But it truly is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  The coleslaw is most delicious sandwich surprise EVER.  

I don't know what else to say, except that I really think that everyone should try it.  It's THAT good."}
{"text":"Cap's is the best sub shop in town, bar none.  Fresh, fast, and friendly.  Don't forget to tip beer money, these folks deserve it."}
{"text":"I liked this place. Friendly people and good food. No much seating available but good atmosphere."}
{"text":"The sandwich was a 2 Star disappointment and when you combine the price this place really earns the lowest rating.  I ordered the Medium Philly with mushrooms and hots on the side along with a small drink- $13.50 what a rip off. (I didnt even get a side or chips what would that have been $15.+) These sandwiches don't even make the average persons top 100 so the sign sets you up for a big let down.  This business should do themselves a favor and remove this blatantly false advertising.  Even a fast food joint like Arbys and their $5.00 Philly is much better.  First time I've wanted to go back and tell them to their faces how below average they really are but its not the folks working hard behind the counters fault so Ill just leave it here.  Save your dime and try almost any other sammie for a better experience."}
{"text":"the guy working behind the bar was great, he took my order and they quickly made me the best capastrami i have ever had. great location, conveniently located with a fast, courteous, efficient staff. will be back, often."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's! Seriously, love this place. This location is the only one on this side of town to get it right, each and every time. Other locations, I always get home and there is something wrong with the order. My go to sandwich is the turkey, no onions, with sweet peppers and oil. I could go for one right now. My husband loves the Bobby. It is like a thanksgiving meal. The staff here is super friendly and the store is always spot less. We eat here at least once a week."}
{"text":"We love Capriotti's, and normally go to the Summerlin location, but we realized we lived closer to this location and decided to stop in. Let's just say we won't be returning to this location. We told them 3 times what we wanted on the sandwich when we ordered. There were 3 girls there listening to this order. While they were making it, they asked if we wanted mustard, which we never mentioned. Fine, at least your checking before putting things on our sub that you aren't sure of, but it should all be right there on our order. Get our sandwich home and it is covered in mayo. We never asked for mayo, it isn't on the receipt, I find it disgusting and can't eat my $15 sandwich now. I called and told them what happened, they said we could come back and exchange it. My husband waits for a ridiculous amount of time upon returning, AT LEAST another 15 minutes. They ran out of receipt paper, which apparently makes their register not work, so people were getting free food. Two people came back in the time it took my husband to get our second sandwich saying that their orders were also messed up. We barely even get an apology after having to drive back and wait some more, no offers of free anything like chips or cookies for next visit, even though people were getting free orders just because they couldn't remember to order receipt paper. Very disappointed in this location, they need to get it together."}
{"text":"After years of using the app, this is my first review on yelp. Ever. That's how displeased I am with my latest visit to this Capriotti's. The standards have really gone down since the first one opened here in the mid 90's. 
I'm from Delaware. The original Capriotti's on Union St. was six blocks from my house. They've been a Delaware staple for as long as I've been alive and their standards were always second to none. Being 20 minutes south of Philly, the competition for good cheesesteaks and subs was pretty fierce in this area... there were at least half a dozen sub shops within a 3 block radius of Capriotti's. If any one of those places were to sell a sub like the one I purchased today they would be out of business in a matter of weeks. The bread was awful and soggy, the tomatoes were mush, and worst of all there was literally about 1/10 of the turkey I would get in just an average sub shop back east. I know the standard here isn't what it is in the Philly area, but come on LV Capriotti's, your product is pathetic. I won't be coming back and I'll be making sure to tell all my friends/family back east to avoid Capriotti's when they're here and just go with a burrito instead."}
{"text":"A nice location and the sandwiches are terrific! I have eaten at Capriotti's throughout the years and have always enjoyed the distinctive styles of their stores and a mellow, friendly place to sit down or pick up your Cole Turkey, etc."}
{"text":"Family hungry and we saw a little  sandwich shop open. Teen daughter wanted smoothie. The hosts, Alex and his wife were so gracious in describing how they make all their sandwiches. The Bobbie was so tender and juicy! They roast their turkeys in house for hours and Alex makes stuffing, cole slaw and cranberry sauce. My husband tried the Capastrami the pastrami was amazing. Quality of meat was excellent! So flavorful! Chicken noodle so good. Smoothies are so healthy and light. I can see why they were voted the best sandwich shop in U.S. You could tell Alex and his wife take great pride in their work. So welcoming and hospitable! Loved  this place!! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The Bobbie sandwich is the only way to go. Best sandwich in town and with thanksgiving coming up, we can cheat and get a head start with the Bobbie"}
{"text":"Oh man. SO excited to review Capriotti's Sandwich Shop!

Today, I had a hankering for a Philly Cheese Steak. So I searched Yelp, which led me to Capriotti's. Honestly, I'm surprised to report that this was my first time visiting. I'm a big sandwich kind of guy and have been to most places like this.

Anyway, I arrived to find multiple signs applauding Capriotti's for winning best sandwich, best food, etc., etc. My first thought was, \"I think I'll be the judge of that.\" (Luckily, I was in for a pleasant surprise!)

I ordered my cheese steak with spicy peppers and onions, paid, then found a seat. While waiting for my sandwich, I noticed a sign stating that if you texted \"ROASTED\" to 90210, you'd get free deals and such. I did this, just in case I enjoyed the food.

** Capriotti's also has its own phone app for easy rewards. I'm a HUGE fan of this concept. I never remember to carry the little key cards these places usually give out and having a custom application created shows a commitment to customer convenience, which I value.

Anyway, the food is prepared pretty quickly and my name is called. I walk up front to retrieve my \"medium\" sandwich. And hoooooly smokes is it a lot of sandwich! I think my eyes bugged out. I'm talking 12\" the way a woman wishes it was measured.  *wink*

The contents were steaming hot, the way they should be. The bread was soft and fresh and delicious. The steak was very flavorful, the peppers were actually even a little bit spicy (which I LOVED), and the cheese was FULLY melted into the steak.

** This may have been the best cheese steak I've ever had, and that's saying a lot because I consider myself a bit of a cheese steak connoisseur.

Once I was through, I walked up front and was helped by the manager with receiving a reprint of my receipt so that I could log the visit on my new rewards app (10 visit and you get a free sandwich - YUM!). Both he and the girl who rung me out were super helpful and really nice.

I couldn't have been more pleased with my visit to Capriotti's Sandwich Shop. I will absolutely be going back, and I will be recommending it to my friends. If you haven't been - GO! You'll probably love it and then maybe I'll see you there sometime.  ;)"}
{"text":"Who the hell runs out if meatballs? Are meatballs a hot menu item. I bet subway doesn't run out of meatballs! Now I go to spinatos! Why do restaurants always mess with me?
OK someone commented to me that they make their own meatballs so yes they can run out. I say, even less of an excuse to run out, you can make more. All YOUR NOT RELYING ON SOMEONE ELSE TO SUPPLY YOUR MEATBALLS!!! Get in the kitchen and make some! OY!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have seen at a capriotti's. Ordered a sandwich, watched the guy write it down and 25 minutes later the same person asked what I wanted when I reminded him of my sandwich, he only said he can't remember where the order went. I watched 4 people come in after me order, one person the same sandwich just a different size then me get their food, pay and leave. I will not be coming back to the location ever again. Looks like I will be going to firehouse for now on!"}
{"text":"We have some friend who were RAVING about this place, so we popped in for a sandwich before a movie recently.  I gotta say, I had a great reuben sandwich that I was VERY pleased with.  I'm not sure if I will be venturing to the area just to have this sandwich again, but it was super tasty.  Everyone seemed to like what they had and the menu has something for everyone.  If I'm in the area again, I might venture here, but I am partial to Jimmy John's (next door) so it might be hard to choose."}
{"text":"Ate here last night at 3:30 am on the way home from the Hard Rock. It's open 24hours and no one was there. The staff was upbeat and very police. They were constantly cleaning things and keeping busy.  The sandwich I had was a roast beef with slaw, med rare. It was a huge 12 for $10. Could hardly finish it but it was quite good for the price .  Will recommend and return. ( this sub could easily be shared with two people."}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie cole turkey sandwich. After I waited about 20 minutes, they said they were still defrosting the ingredients and I'd need to wait about another 10 minutes. When I finally got the sandwich, the cole slaw inside it was so salty that it made the whole sandwich almost inedible. I heard another guy also complain that the cole slaw was too salty and they said sorry, it's just our recipe."}
{"text":"It touts to have the best sandwich.  IN THE WORLD.  That's right at the entry, and it points to the Gobbie as being the cataclysmic end to sandwiches.

Okay, they didn't deliver.  Simple as that.

Being in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale, there's a ton of food options here.  This sandwich is on par with Jimmy John's, and dare I say that the Jimmy John's Beach Club is even better.  They're across the street.  Dry turkey, basic stuffing...  Go elsewhere.

BUT the good part about this place is the Shake Shack right next door.  Give that place a try.  It was good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a yummy quick sandwich..soo good! Meatball good, roast beef excellent!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best turkey sandwich in the planet. 'Nuff said....  I've never been disappointed with their service either. Thanks guys and girls"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a Capriotti's being built on my street. I pass it every day going and coming from work. How convenient!  Tried it last week. You'd think a SLAW Be Jo would have some SLAW on it. There was maybe a tablespoon of slaw in the middle along with a smear of 1000 Island dressing. The bread was completely DRY as was the roast beef. It was like jerky, actually the ends were even crunchy. I had to trim off those parts. I ate half the sandwich (after putting on dressing at home) and threw the rest in the bin. I've had this sandwich at several locations. It was good there. It was awful here. How do you screw up a sandwich?  And with one couple ahead of me at 6.30 pm, the wait should NOT be 20 minutes for a sandwich. Location or not. This place better get its act together. People won't stand for crappy food. Not in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Talk about GREAT sandwiches!!! The Capastrami is the BEST!!! This place is always voted Best Of Vegas every year for a good reason!! The food RULES!! The bread and meats are always fresh and delicious! Over 10 years of enjoying sandwiches at Capriottis and I have never been disappointed!! The staff is always friendly and efficient. I now live in California, but Capriottis is the first place I hit when I pull into town. I always pick it up BEFORE I get to my destination! 

FYI - They have a Elvis impersonator who makes the experience extra enjoyable (especially for Laura!!!)"}
{"text":"I always get the large cheese steak with all the extras. Delicious.  Place is always packed but the line moves pretty quickly. If your looking for an in expensive awesome sandwich shop, Capriotti's Sandwich Shop off of Paradise Rd, or anywhere in LV will put subway to shame!"}
{"text":"Restaurant is filthy. Accumulated layers of dirt in dining area. The floors show evidence of some mopping but you can tell they just push dirty water around with a mop. No real floor care. The braces connecting the legs of the chairs are filthy and every table was sticky. Underneath the soda machine and in the condiment area there is accumulated layers of dust and filth with some evidence of mold in the drain tray on the dispenser.  The cooking area is cluttered and again layered in dirt. HEALTH HAZARD. 

Cashier was totally apathetic and you could tell ZERO fucks was given."}
{"text":"How the fu*k do you run out of rolls!? We came in at 3:00am and was told that they no longer had rolls but only had sandwich bread and cold sandwiches."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and will never go back. Absolutely disgusting! 

The cook dropped the spatula, didn't wash it, and used it to put food onto a sandwich.  I told the guy who was about to take my order what happened, Then i said that's fucking disgusting and walked out. 

I sure hope one of the people behind the counter did the right thing and didn't serve the sandwich.  

What else are they doing to their food?"}
{"text":"Capriottis is always a delicious place to go to.  I usually get the bobbie sandwich but this time i got a capastrami sandwich.  The coleslaw with the hot pastrami was really good.  And i'm usually not a coleslaw fan.  Touche Cap! Touche! 

You can never go wrong with this place.  Load up with a big meaty sandwich and just chow down in taste bud delight. Cant ever go wrong with the cap!"}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Capriottis I've been to in Vegas thus far. Maybe because its in a casino environment so you can grab a brew or take your sandwich on the go to the blackjack tables. The staff was very friendly to my guest and I when taking our orders. Everyone had a jolly smile and seemed like they were enjoying their work. I had the Bobbie and it was heaven! Cranberry sauce, stuffing, turkey, and Mayo on a hoagie roll. My second favorite is the Capastrami. Pastrami, coleslaw, and Russian dressing on a hoagie roll. They have small, medium, and large (9in., 12in., and 20in.) sized sandwiches. Capriottis is a bit on the pricey side but its worth every penny."}
{"text":"One of the tastiest sandwich places I have ever been to. Seriously. Recommendations: cheese steak sandwich and. Capastami ! The wait may be a bit long at peak hours but  it's worth it. Plenty of vegetarian options too."}
{"text":"Walked through the door and was greeted by a gentlemen from the back, the boy who rang me up did not say anything but just stared at me until I ordered. I am always polite wherever I go unless someone is rude to me, kid seemed like he hated being there so I ordered my food and when it was time to sign my receipt I decided to give a $1 tip and after I handed him the receipt he looked at the girl making my sandwich and said \"got the money for beer now\". I think it would have been more appropriate to keep that to yourself and not announcing it out loud or quietly saying it to her. When my sandwich was done the girl who made the sandwich placed it on the counter where another woman was ordering food and I had to squeeze in between her and the chip rack to grab it and I didn't find that appropriate when she could of handed it to me at a different part of the counter. She did not say thank you or have a great day. I know plenty of people without a job that would be grateful to work and replace the people without any common customer service courtesy.. I will return to capriottis but not this location."}
{"text":"This location is in desperate need of a cleaning. Grime everywhere and dirty vents. Used to love coming here, but they need to clean up their act. Shame to see the place nose dive.

Food quality has dipped gauging from the Bobbie."}
{"text":"really really large subs.

we wanted a quick bite while hanging out on the outskirts of lv strip,
and happened upon capriotti's. we ordered a small meatball sub,
a small is ....9 inches. a large is 20 inches. holy moly. 

... a small is enough for two people (they cut it in half).
the bread was on the soggier side even though we just ordered it. 
perhaps, toasting it more would've made it hold better. 
the meatballs were full and meaty and there was plenty of bold tomato sauce.

overall .. is it better than subway? yes. by a lot? not really."}
{"text":"The line was long (lunch rush) but moved quickly. Karenlee our cashier was very friendly to me and my daughter. Wait for food wasn't very long despite the crowd. They forgot my side of pepper relish but caught the mistake & got it to us before we left the store. 

We ordered to go but store was clean and parking was plentiful. They have three spots designated for to go orders, which I really like!"}
{"text":"This location is ok.  It's a little slower than other Capriotti's locations, and it can get really busy depending on the time of day.  They also close early because they are located inside the regional justice center.  If you go in the early afternoon they may not have what you are looking for because they don't want to make a new \"batch\" just to throw it out when they close.  I love the Philly cheesesteak and chicken Philly cheesesteak sandwiches.  Not a bad spot if you are stuck in the RJC, but if you have time there are other better options nearby."}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here! There is NO comparison to Subway or Port of Subs. When I think of all the years we dined at the other two places mentioned, I wish we'd known about Capriotti's back then.

The ingredients are all so fresh and tasty and very generous in size. They have a variety of sandwiches and I have tried a few, which all taste great, but always come back to my favorite cold Italian sub. The staff is really great too at this Cheyenne location.  I recommend this place to anyone who would like a really good sub at great price."}
{"text":"Two outta three aint bad, right?  Went in with my mom and my daughter, and of the three sandwiches we ordered, the Italian and the Cheesesteak (without cheese, btw...) were much better than my Capastrami.  We all ordered mediums, which were huge, and we were able to savor the leftovers for dinner.  The unfortunate thing was that the cole slaw and/or the Russian dressing were too sweet for me.  I'm sure some people will say otherwise, but to be safe, ask for them on the side.  There's a lot of both, which kinda makes the sandwich soggy.  Other than the overly sweet Capastrami, the other two were pretty tasty.  A definite second chance is on the horizon."}
{"text":"I love their cheese steak subs. If you want a cold sandwich, try the cole turkey."}
{"text":"Review based only on cleanliness of the venue. It was absolutely gross with food all over the floor in the main cooking area as well as in the back room area. Dripping water faucet. Soup spilled over the soup kettle & dried & crusted on. There was food scraps laying on the back counter. Food crumbs on register portion of where customers pay for their food. One of the workers was in the back brushing all the food from a counter onto a floor then walks right through the pile of crap on the floor to come to the front of the store. Hasn't anyone here ever heard of wiping the food into your hand & then disposing of it in the trash? Afraid of what might have ended up in my sandwich with all the dirtiness in the place. How they got an A from the health department (certificate on the wall) is beyond me. Employees weren't overly friendly. Photos taken of the dirty floors but unfortunately the pics don't do it justice to how dirty it really was. Will definitely not be coming back. Would rather go to Firehouse Subs where they keep the place clean."}
{"text":"Don't go here. Just don't. The employee had his pants half way down his butt and was wearing a tank top! Don't they have uniforms? The sandwiches we did get I'm pretty sure my 4 yr old could have assembled better. I had to search for the turkey! Its so pricey for such poor quality food.  Sounds like by reading other reviews (which I wish I had before stopping in) they need to find better employees."}
{"text":"I work a lot of trade shows and always ask the I&D for the best delivery option. All the labor and booth staff loves this place for a delivered lunch. The Bobbie is just like my favorite day after thanksgiving sandwich, people also liked roast beef and the capistrami. Call at least 1-2 hours ahead for delivery or well before 10am for noon delivery."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is by far the BEST Sub Sandwich in the world!  Their signature sandwich is called \"The Bobbie\" and is a THANKSGIVING MEAL! If you like turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, and more.  My personal favorite is the Cheese Steak. Try it, I guarantee you will LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. The manager will drop steak on the floor then pick it back up and use it. I mean a whole bucket of steak not just one piece!! If you like food made by dirty hands this is the place for you. They will eat, smoke, and touch raw meat without washing there hands once. I've watched the general manager touch the phone with a gloved hand then go right back to your sandwiches!! BEWARE the disgusting practices at this store!!"}
{"text":"First time using the Capriotti's app. Seems very easy to use. Unfortunately one of the workers did not know what she was doing. Was going to charge me again until I pointed out that I had already paid online. Then she realized one of the sandwiches she messed up on. Thank goodness it was rectified before I received my food. However we also ordered a medium cheese steak add hot peppers add double extra cheese... I feel as though I got jipped on my cheese. BF said flavor with hot peppers on point. the Bobby was on point Thank you to the young man who remade my sandwich."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit to this location. The previous 2 visits were very satisfactory. This last time, however, you guys were really off your game. My ham sandwich on kaiser roll was half empty! Half the meat, no condiments to speak of(???) and the roll was turning stale. The manager(s) need to concentrate on re-training and quality control."}
{"text":"It deeply disturbs me that Subway has become the go-to sub shop around the states. Apparently when the oil shortage started there was also a cold cuts bandit that held Subway hostage and now you're only allowed 3 slices of meat on your mediocre roll and if you'd like the blandness toasted, they can do that now too, oh joy. 

I would vote for Capriotti's to take over all Subways but I'd most likely gain 20 pounds from eating a sub everyday for the rest of my life. A foot long a day would make any girl happy.

Capriotti's prides itself on freshness, slow cooking and hand pulling their turkey and roast beef at the shop. The three sammys I suggest and love are the grilled italian, the cheese steak, and the signature bobbie. The first 2 are pretty self explanatory, loaded with tons of meat, cheese and veggies and beyond scrumptious. The bobbie however is specific to them and is made of  homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo. Your first bobbie will have your taste buds dancing and when you stare that sub down like Joey on Friends you'll never be the same. Every Subway you pass from that moment on will look like the talentless redheaded stepchild of the sub world.

{"text":"I am a resident of Boulder City and have never been here. For lunch last week I ordered a  veggie cheese steak which took 35 min to make. I took it with me as I was running late for work, placed $2 in the tip jar, and when I opened it, everything except the bread was burned, tough, and inedible. Not what I expect for a $10 sandwich plus a $2 tip. I probably won't be back unless they make good on my poor first experience. So far I've had zero luck talking with someone via telephone."}
{"text":"For a sandwich shop with a limited selection they really bring their A game. I cant remember the name of my sandwich but it was a hot sandwich with schredded chicken and all of the extra goodies on top with a special sauce. It was quite delicious ....so if I were you and in the area of this shop I'd definately go check it out =) small but good =)"}
{"text":"There is absolutely no way to get in contact with this location. Their phone will only say the connection cannot be completed. The staff is highly incompetent and unmotivated to help with anything. Place a pick up order and upon arriving they asked what we would like. We have them our name for pick and said they'd ring us up when the order was ready. We waited 30 mins for an estimated 15 and went back to the counter. She asked again what we would like and mentioned yet again, to the same person, that we had a pick up order that we waited at the location for for 30 mins. No discount and still had to pay. Not to mention no a/c. Thanks for wasting my time."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options. Inexpensive sandwich shop that makes very large and tasty sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Came here to eat. Sandwich was great but.. Wasn't a clean table in the place for one.. Then the majority of employees had long hair, no hair net .. Not sanitary if you ask me.plus they lazy standing around texting with all dirty tables Staff...About as friendly as a brick wall..... Needless to say... I'm Not returning to this filthy mess"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed many sandwich shoppes   across Arizona over my 25 years hear, but this is one of the best. The freshness of the turkey and the vegetables on top of daily fresh baked bread is incredible."}
{"text":"Aside from the food being very delicious the customer service is top notch. The gentleman that took my order was named Edgar and he was so friendly and patient! I definitely appreciated that. I personally have never ordered anything besides the Bobbie here because every time I walk in that's what I have to get. I love that there are locations in Arizona because I used to love to eat here when I visited Vegas."}
{"text":"I moved to Vegas 2 years ago and tried Caps for the first time. I immediately fell in love with the Capistrami. It is hands down the best sandwich you will ever eat in your life. I always get friendly and speedy service at this location."}
{"text":"My friends came to Las Vegas and wanted to eat here for lunch. She said that there is only 1 CAPRIOTTI'S in CA (where shes from), which is located in Beverly Hills. Luckily, theres Caps all over town in LV. This gave me the perfect opportunity to try out their Bobbie.

I never had a traditional \" Thanksgiving..in your mouth..\" type of sandwich before, so I didn't know what to expect. This cold sub had layers of home-made turkey meat, sweet cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo spread. 

-I'm never a big fan of cold subs.
-My family doesn't have turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce during Thanksgiving. So I guess I didn't know how to appreciate the sub.
-The combination of cold turkey, sweet cranberry sauce, cold soft/soggy stuffing..was just okay. I wasn't wowed or felt like I tasted a bit of heaven or anything.

I think this sub is suited for someone else that knows how to appreciate traditional American Thanksgiving. Everyone I know says this sub is really good. Its just too bad it wasn't for me."}
{"text":"I love it but I have to get my wife to order me the cheesesteak she knows what I like to have on it. But the Bobby is so good to eat all their food is good to eat and is always clean and the people always nice to me and my wife. And that's what's important to me."}
{"text":"Oh... My... GAWD! The Bobbie is AH-MAZING. Yeah- that's valley girl speak for fuckin' awesome. Fresh roasted turkey, mixed with a generous helping of mayo, topped with cranberry sauce and homemade stuffing on a deliciously soft french roll?!??!? Are you freakin' kiddin' me? 

The house made roast beef was pretty good too... a tad dry for my taste, but quite flavorful. The wise chips are legit."}
{"text":"This was the most worst experience ever I came in ordered over 100 dollars worth of food for my family and was missing a 20 inch sub which I was over charged for and dinit even receive i then came home AND FOUND HAIR IN MY SANDWICH I called in and was told to come back in anytime and that they would replace my order they even told Me they wrote down my name when I called to replace my order I got called a liar and that there is nothing that they would do for me the next day I don't recommend coming here go to subway or Quiznos instead I also don't write many reviews but they was such a bad experience I felt I had to warn others"}
{"text":"Been there twice. First was a good philly cheese steak. 
Second time, had the infamous Bobbie. 
Both great."}
{"text":"If my stomach had a Hall of Fame, it would have a section dedicated to Capriotti's.

Last night, I went to the Tempe location for the first time, and man-o-man, was I in for a treat. 

I've been a fan of this chain for a couple years. I discovered a location near my home in Las Vegas and ever since, I have been a huge fan! 

Of course, I hopped on my trusty Yelp app, and made sure that the Tempe location was the closest to Scottsdale (for now...there is one coming soon), but then...like a Coke machine in the middle of the freaking Sahara desert, I saw it....a YELP DEAL....for CAPRIOTTI'S! SWEET BABY JESUS! HELL FREAKING YEAH! 

I paid $7 for a $15 deal and parkoured my way down to Tempe like it was nobody's business. Parking was a bit of a problem since it was a game night. I also had to deal with the traffic from the ASU/USC traffic, but I love Capriotti's enough to brave any kind of traffic.

The shop is small, but nice. Two TV's. Enough seating. Friendly staff. 

Tonight's addition to my imaginary Hall of Fame: Large Cole-Turkey with Ham. Yeah, I added the ham. I'm renegade like that. I guess you can say that I just go with it. 

The Cole Turkey is: pulled turkey, cole slaw, provolone, russian dressing, and mayo. So, so good. 

If you are a Capriotti's virgin, the large is a 20' sandwich. It's no joke. It can feed four people. I had my sandwich cut into four pieces. I ate one of them, put the other three in my fridge.  

All in all, I really like this location. Staff, food....everything. Perfect. If I ever come back to Tempe, this is my spot...even over Jimmy John's. Yes.

Capriotti's GREATER THAN Jimmy John's

{"text":"Best cheesesteak I've ever had I will definitely go back. The staff was extremely friendly and the service was fast."}
{"text":"With all the Cap's that have opened over the years, it's nice that this (one of the original locations before they sold) one has stayed for the most part consistent. On recent visits I have noticed some changes like the decor, tables and chairs, use of actual plates/bowls and silverware, and mostly how the employees have been friendlier. my wife likes this new Capture 2 deal they have but she also has a small appetite I personally don't get full enough off a 4 and a half inch sandwich and cup of soup. I like to order the medium sandwich to get my fill and for the days my wife and I share the large is great since it's 20 inches so big enough to share. The capastrami alright but I like the Italian sandwich and the cheese steak the most. Some people complain about the turkey sandwiches being dry but if they just read the menu it says right on it that the sandwiches come standard with lettuce, cheese, tomato, and onion but customers can feel free to add on things like crushed peppers, mayo, oil, etc. and it's free. You just gotta tell them you want mayo on it otherwise it's your fault it's dry. They have a new app for your phone that earns you credit towards free items with every purchase and the more you progress with the rewards program the sweeter the rewards are. This location being one of the older ones isn't very roomy inside but they do have some tables if you are lucky enough to nab one. Phone orders work best to get you in and out."}
{"text":"This place has actually turned me on to sandwiches! Capriotti's hands down is one of the best sandwich places in town!  

Even if you get the smallest sandwich they are huge and well packed with goodness.  They have a good variety of sandwiches and each one I have tried so far I've loved like the Bobbie, with real shredded turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo.  Taking this sandwich home and toasting it up a bit in the oven is a must do. 

I learned that they cook 6 birds a day, and this year the day before Thanksgiving they cooked 11 birds and were out a few hours before closing.  I was the second to last Bobbie...phew!  But this was the case at all locations so again \"One of the best sandwiches in town\"  Among my other favorites are their cappastrami, Italian, and the vegetarian sandwich.  

Dine in our take home either way you are sure to enjoy one of their great selections."}
{"text":"I haven't heard of this chain, but I was looking for a quick bite tonight and wow was I impressed! 
I got the veggie cheesesteak with the works. As a vegetarian, it was so good I had to second guess if it was in fact vegetarian (it was). Well done vegetarian food for a chain!"}
{"text":"OMG. I think this is THE best sammich I have ever had. The Bobbie is Thanksgiving in a roll. Every bite was delish and I inhaled the whole thing in about 15 mins. My bf had the Capastrami. Just as delicious and out of this world. I couldn't stop thinking about Capriotti's during my whole trip. We ended up back here at 10am to get a few to take home."}
{"text":"WORST customer service of my life!!! Made an attempt to call in a order TWICE, only to sit on hold for 10 min each time. Made it to the store- still on hold....there were literally 3 customers in the store and 4 staff members. Showed the lady at the register that I  was STILL on hold with her- no one behind me either mind you...she said \"ya?....\" Absolutely NO REGARD or concern that I had sat on hold for 20 min only to come into a not busy store...didn't even offer me an apology. Just asked what I would like. Later tried to come back and say she \"doesn't have the ability\" to run the register AND answer phones at the same time. Then went further to say that the \"people who walk in the door get serviced before the phone calls are answered\"  There are Staff members here, no line out the door, 3 customers in the whole place....Absolute worst!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite sandwich place! Great philly cheesesteak sandwiches. The italian is also really good. The large is more than enough for two people to split. They will add sweet or hot peppers and fried onions at no charge to the sandwiches. Clean, friendly and quick considering they don't premake the sandwiches. Good prices as well for how much you get. I will be back to try their meatball sandwich which is a true measure in my book of a sandwhich place! I will update my review then! Could possible be 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out while in Vegas for work and The Bobbie definitely was delicious. I figured I should try the sandwhich that started it all. It was delicious. The turkey, cranberry and stuffing is a great combination. I'd definitely come back if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"On occasion I get the urge for a big old Italian grinder.  In my neighborhood I know exactly where to go to to satisfy this craving, but I have no clue where to go in North Scottsdale.  I took a chance on Capriotti's.

The restaurant was packed, but the staff was very efficient in getting food out.  Grinder in hand, I head back to work to try it out.

The sandwich was huge, easily big enough for two meals.  As for the flavor?  It was ok, but not exactly memorable. All of the components were there, but the sandwich as a whole didn't stand out.

I'm willing to try the 'Best Sandwich in America' at least once, but I won't be going back for the grinder."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of this place for about 2 years. I first started eating here when Postmates started up. I think I've only been inside of the actual restaurant two times.  So yesterday I went there because I was craving a nice hot sandwich and I love the cherry peppers. When I got there it was like 30 minutes into closing the staff were already put up all the chairs it look like it was no place to order. I was okay with that I know how it is I work in the restaurant industry myself. But the staff was very shady looking. I am all into giving people Second Chances because I am a convict myself. But the staff look like they are still battling drug addiction and criminal activity. So I was eating my sandwich and then I noticed a homeless guy was talking to the staff went to the back and started working. The food was great the service was good but everybody looked it really shady and why was there somebody that's not on payroll in the back. Due to the way that the staff look I will not be going there again."}
{"text":"Delicious & very filling sandwiches. The small was hardly small.... The Bobbie fulfilled a Thanksgiving craving of mine. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's has GREAT sandwiches. I am a Bobbie addict. I have frequented this location many times, and they are always friendly and nice. I think they renovated this location a bit recently, it looks good!"}
{"text":"Woohoo, this place is really good. a little spendy but you will not leave hungry."}
{"text":"I'd love this place it was really good and the owner of the restaurant was very nice very accommodating I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Mushroom Cheesesteak with provolone & mayo, a bag of Wise chips, and a Coke.

Doesn't that sound appetizing?  I pretty much get the same thing every single time I come here.

They make my cheesesteak EXACTLY they way I prefer my cheesesteak sandwich.  

Call in your order before driving there if you are impatient.  Either way, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've found it hard to find a good grinder (aka: sub, hoagie, sandwich) place since we've moved from CT. Capriotti's is the best of the best! My husband and I can't get enough of the Cole Turkey! Super delicious and filling! I think the only downfall when going there is the wait to get your order... such a bummer to have to wait an additional 15 minutes after ordering ahead of time! Oh well! It's worth it!"}
{"text":"1.5 stars!

Everyone in my family LOVES Capriotti's. I seem to be the only one asking, \"What makes this place so great?!\"

I'm not joking when I say I'd rather have Quiznos (preferably Togo's, but I have only had Togo's in California).

They are never consistent. When you order a sandwich on Tuesday it'll taste different from the one you order next Saturday. Guaranteed. They kill everything with peppers, even when I ask for NO peppers.

I'd rather have a toasted Italian from Subway. Or ANYTHING from Quizno's. And I haven't tried much other than the Italian from most places (just my preference - I know what I like).

One time I went here with my mom and my brother to pick up lunch and they closed the store without locking the front door because they RAN OUT OF BREAD.

We opened the door, stood there waiting and heard people in the back, and they laughed and came out and said, \"Oh, sorry...we ran out of bread a while ago. We should get some tomorrow.\"

So AFTER we left, disappointed, they locked the door.

A sandwich shop with no bread...that's a new one.

1.5 stars for the drinks, chips and the bundt cakes. Forget the sammies."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with our sandwiches. We were recently at a party that served sandwiches from Capriotti's.  They were delicious so we decided to pick up some sandwiches from our local shop. Needless to say... they were disgusting.  The roast beef was so dry it was impossible to chew. It was cut in slabs and also cut the wrong direction Making it even tougher to chew.
We ventured out in the  middle of a rain storm passed several other sandwich shops only to throw the mess away."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Capastrami, or The Bobbie! But my fave is a Homemade Turkey on Wheat, Grilled Onions and the whole sandwich grilled -- so everything melts together! Yummmmm!"}
{"text":"Capastrami, Capastrami, Capastrami!

A local chain that is decent. Tried other items including SlawBeJoe and The Bobbie, but those were not as good as Capastrami.

Also, small is the new large here. I always order small and can't finish."}
{"text":"I tried this sandwich restaurant just bcuz some of my coworkers kept ranting about how Capriotti's has the best subs. I tried the sub that has turkey, cranberry sauce & stuffing thinking that it was going to be delicious due to my coworkers recommendations. Well, I was wrong, that sub combo was gross. It was too many flavors that over powered each other & too much cranberry sauce. Over all gross.! Then today my husband & I we decided to try Capriotti's again, I decided to try the 6 inch tuna sub. As it turns out it was average, nothing to it, nothing special. I make better tuna sandwiches @ home than this place does. I will never come here again & I will make sure that none of my friends go to this place or waste their $$$ when they go to Vegas. Disappointed, this place is average, Subway wins this one. This place is BLAH!"}
{"text":"I would really like to write a review about how good this place is and how good their service is but I can't. I placed an order for delivery through yelp eat street, paid, and got a confirmation number. An hour past and my food was still not here. I called the store which I had ordered from and they have no idea what I was talking about. I'm very disappointed I had heard great things about this place."}
{"text":"So I placed an online order for a future time. I gave them 6 hours notice. (three sandwiches and three brownies)  I also added a $7 tip. When I showed up, I was told just a few minutes- they were just finishing. 15 minutes later, after they made sandwiches for two customers who came in after me, they finally finished. I had to tell them they forgot the brownies- and they never said anything about the 15 minute wait. No apology, no thank you at all. And while I was there, I got to listen to them complain to each other about how one is working so hard while the other is doing nothing. Good times. The Capriottis on Eastern in Anthem is a farther drive, but the customer service is way better."}
{"text":"We have been to a few different locations a handful of times and the sandwiches are always the same. Dry and tasteless. On our last visit to the Sunset location I ordered the Turkey on sliced bread and it came out as their usual sandwich. I didn't even bother asking them to remake it. Wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Wow!  I loved the bobby!  This thing was so amazing!  If you ever want to fix your thanksgiving craving, go to Capriottis!  Thankfullybthwy had a yelp deal, or I probably wouldn't have tried this place.  YUMMY"}
{"text":"They had 2 people working the lunch rush, no brainer they need at least one more.  I eat at capriottis all the time and it was my first trip to this location.   I was severely underwhelmed and my sandwich was ok at best."}
{"text":"Finished off the work week at a solid lunch location with some folks from the office.  I have visited other Capriotti's in the valley and found this one to be one of the superior spots to visit.  The service was friendly and attentive.

Given that it was raining today, I decided on a Capistrami.  This glorious sandwich contains warm pastrami, melted swiss cheese, coleslaw, and Russian dressing.  The medium seems just about right as I would hate myself for eating a small or a...large.

We arrived slightly before the lunch rush but this seems to have little impact of the efficiency of the place.  Our meal came out in a timely manner.  As I dined on my sandwich, I took notice of the line as it moved quickly with those just arrived and those who had called ahead.

My one recommendation is to snag a bag of medium sized chips.  Offering other flavors not available in the small size, there is enough for two and you pay only a smidgen more.

True, a soda fountain would be nice.  The water, bottled soda, and sports drinks are barley enough to wash down these wonderful sandwiches."}
{"text":"The cashier wasn't very helpful and skipped me and chose to take other customers orders, and when I tried ordering extras he said he didn't have anything available. I still tipped him but I would never come back to this Capriotti's again."}
{"text":"I LOVE \"The Bobbie\".... Its the best thing since sliced bread. LoL dont get me wrong. All the sandwiches here are great. But I only get that one. And of course i make sure to ger the LARGE. HAHAHAHAH. BRING UR FRIENDS"}
{"text":"Capriotti's has a solid turkey sandwich called the gobbler that reminds me Thanksgiving every time I get it it's so tasty and wonderful got turkey stuffing turkey meat and cranberry on I think it wheat. Another solid sandwich to get at Capriotti's is the Philly cheesesteak you can almost never go wrong but he may want to get easy onion since sometimes they really overdue the onions for the Philly cheese steak and that isn't the best. Happy Hunting!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite sandwich places.  I recommend:  The Bobbie (turkey with cranberry sauce and stuffing) and the Capastrami (hot pastrami with their special sauce).  The sandwiches are huge and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Gourmet sandwiches? done and done. this place does not skimp on the toppings.  The Bobby is my fav, with turkey and stuffing and cranberry sauce.  Thanksgiving every time.  Great every time.  Really good, really good service, really high quality product.  I belong to the text club and get free drinks and chips, so its and even better deal.  Love this place for a fast meal."}
{"text":"Overrated.  I was shocked to see this place is highly rated on Yelp, I almost always agree with Yelp reviews... NOT THIS TIME. Went here highly recommended by someone, left highly disappointed.

Here's the story, me and five friends go for lunch to get sandwiches, for the five of us lunch was $75.00. us dollars.  Now I really don't mind paying for food... but at $75 for sandwiches, they had better be amazing, they were not.  No one was impressed with their meal, it was just ok.... really expensive ok. 

I got a pastrami sandwich that had very little pastrami and a load of \"Russian\" sauce (which tasted like a bottle of craft thousand island to me) not a good sandwich.

Everyone in my party had similar feelings about their lunch... my wallet still cringes every time I drive by there."}
{"text":"Today was a cheese steak with sautéed mushrooms & onions kind of day.  Wow!  The steak had a wonderful herbal note to it, the mushrooms & onions were cooked perfectly for the sandwich (thank you for seasoning them perfectly), and it came out hot.  I got my fix for the day!

My Dad loved the bread so much that he ordered a loaf to take home - very cool!"}
{"text":"Sand which was poorly made. Got the signature sandwich (Bobbie) wasn't impressed. The cranberry sauce isn't real. The stuffing was served cold, with a very small amount of turkey. All for 9$ not sure how that sand which could be voted greatest of anything"}
{"text":"Delicious goodness. A bargain if walking over from the Hard Rock. I don't know what kind of fake turkey meat they use for the vegetarian items but it makes me happy whether hot or cold.  The Bobbie is also really good if you eat meat. It tastes like Thanksgiving in a sandwich.

Now, you may be tempted to try to finish off a 12 inch sandwich because of the slight upcharge. Just because you can finish a foot long at subway, doesn't mean you should try to do it at Capriotti.

Staff is friendly. You order at the counter but you don't pay until the sandwich is made like Subway."}
{"text":"I'm starting to realize that crisp, toasted bread has to do a lot with my rating of sandwich shops. I'm giving Capriotti 4 stars because my friends could not stop raving about their \"real meat\" and how they beat Earl of Sandwich and Bay Cities by far. Otherwise I would have given it 3 stars because I still like the \"mystery meat\" Potbelly, Earl, and Bay Cities better because overall they have better sauces and yummy toasty bread (except Bay Cities -- I think their bread is too hard!)."}
{"text":"i created a yelp account just to be able to say that i was there on Sunday at about 2 o'clock and i wanted to order a vegetarian chicken cheese steak & this girl (idk her name but she has very nice thick blonde hair) told me they didn't have such a thing or something along those lines & made me feel uncomfortable. i pointed at the menu and said well why is it on there then? and she still made me feel uncomfortable for ordering it so i ended up just getting the cole turkey. 

i'm not vegetarian i just heard that it was very good and wanted to try it but she was just weird about the whole thing. then when i was leaving she seemed snarky to the other employee and told her to just go start on the dishes idk if she was training her or what but i felt it was rude."}
{"text":"After yelping for good places to lunch I was headed toward the \"Oyster Bar\" when I found out that I could not eat there since I'm underage (21 and over)! 

But good thing!! Because I was able to try Capriotti's Sandwiches and it was amaazinggggg!
My boyfriend and I ordered the recommended \"Capastrami\" and the \"Bobbie\" and split half and half.
The Capastrami is a hot sandwich with pastrami and coleslaw and some special sauce. This one was my favorite! I think I gulfed it down within 5 minutes. 
Next came the Bobbie which is a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce and stuffing. It was delicious and something new, but I think it was way too dry (I finished my whole bottle of iced tea while eating this half). 
The wait was reallyyyyy long which is why I took one star off; I think we waited about 30-40 minutes just to get our sandwiches. And there aren't that many tables inside so we also had to wait for seats to clear. 
All in all it was a great experience and I will be heading there again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"They claim to have the best sandwich in America and they're not far from that. When I walked in I was greeted by a very friendly staff member who walked me through some of there signature sandwiches only to be quickly sold on the capastrami. Let me tell you that this was definitely one of the best subs I've ever had. When I ordered the medium sub priced at 9$ I was kind of shocked at how expensive it seemed, but when my order came out the \"medium\" I had ordered happened to be bigger than most other sub shops \" large \" sandwiches. All in all I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times during lunch, and although the Bobby sandwich is good, this place feels pretty dirty. On the most recent trip, the order was completely wrong and the individual behind the counter was less than thrilled to correct it. Won't waste my money here again."}
{"text":"Capriotti's has the best turkey sub in all of America. They roast their turkeys everyday and the white rolls are of top quality. Go ahead and order the two footer you won't be disappointed. That's a whole days worth of food right there."}
{"text":"OK - I'm jumping them up to four stars because I stopped in this morning and not only did they have salt bagels, the guy told me that he had hired a new baker and that means he won't have to be there seven days a week anymore. I'm hoping that this means that they will have salt bagels everyday from now on.

Also, the new baker did a great job and my salt bagels tasted great!!!"}
{"text":"Located inside the Red Rock Casino by the movie theater. Good place for a quick meal. Good sub for your money. If you check in you get a free large drink and they do free refills for it. It is not like a typical sub place, the sizes for sandwiches go from 9\" , 12\", to 20\". My boyfriend and I got the meatball and cheese steak subs. Good quality, not horrible, not amazing, but good.They are definitely better than subways though. Definitely will go there again if we're in the area."}
{"text":"The food is always 5 stars never been disappointed.
But there's always a big guy here, who I believes name is Cody, cory, something like that.. who is just over the top!
The manager, supervisor, owner? Idk but he's super obnoxious. 
Screams at you when you come in.. no smile no expression, just loud!
Then checking Someones $50 bill he was super weird and stared the guy down.. idk not a fan of that guy."}
{"text":"I've done some reviews on Capriotti's shops in Las Vegas, so it's fitting I visit the nearest shop to my home in Scottsdale and write about it.

Grab the Bobbie, the Capostramie, or the Grilled Italian. You won't be disappointed. The quality of the ingredients, the cleanliness of the restaurant, the taste....oh the taste.

Don't come here if you are looking for a limp five dollar sandwich. You can go to the underground train for that. You want a solid meal...come here.

This Mesa location is pretty new. Opened up back in August. 

Highlights: 

1. Staff is friendly. Even when I come in right before closing.
2. The menu, although the same across the board, is amazing.
3. Bread quality is high.
4. Restaurant is CLEAN!
5. PLENTY of seating!
6. A nice TV to watch the game.

Lowlights
None. This is Capriotti's. Duh. It's a winner."}
{"text":"They say a sandwich can make or break a day. OK, maybe not. I say that, but by the amount of sandwiches I eat at Capriotti's, I may qualify for a \"they\".

When I moved to Vegas back in November, I saw a bunch of these Capriotti's locations around town. I also happened to see a Thrillist article about a new location in Beverly Hills (I moved here from LA).

I paid a visit to this location, and I've been back MANY times. I follow the company on Twitter (@capriottis) and even won a free sub for being a follower. Very interactive company and they WANT your business.

But I digress...

Their signature is obviously The Bobbie. Pulled Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing and Mayo. Divine. Heavenly. Any other words that describe it? Angelic and pristine? It'll turn your tongue into Niagara Falls. 

Also the Grilled Italian, which I wont bother describing, because it's an experience all to itself. As is the Capostramie.

Aside from the great sandwiches, you have your choice of Wise chips, and TASTYKAKES! Prepare for an experience. 

It's worth the calories."}
{"text":"Unimaginably slow. Four employees working at a snail pace. Actually that's unkind to snails."}
{"text":"Been to this place in Delaware many times! Love it. Was worried I would be disappointed in WI. It was amazing as always. Turkey and provolone was amazing as was the cheese steak. Turkey was fresh and moist, bread was soft and fresh. Cheese steak had a great meat / cheese ratio."}
{"text":"Who freakin' knew you could experience Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich? Because of The Bobby sandwich, I can't help but say this might be the best sandwich chain.  

I also gravitate toward getting a Phili cheese sandwich. Boy do they load this up with deliciously flavored meat! :) I kinda wish they could a bit more cheese and better peppers to make it even tastier. Pretty awesome choice even with these minor flaws. 

If you are ordering for two, I suggest going with their largest size sandwich and splitting it in two, rather than individually choosing the smallest so you can get more for for the value."}
{"text":"Really great food & awesome service. Very welcome
Atmosphere. This is my families favorite sandwich shop. Never disappointed. Great 4 party trays too."}
{"text":"I hate that when I order something I always got to check when Brianna told me all my sides are there when there not! On top of that she puts Russian sauce and spills it all over the bag! Didn't have my sweet peppers in there which messes up my sandwich. So many people working today and they all still manage to mess everything up. Spending $30 at the place I just wish they check my order thoroughly."}
{"text":"My husband loves a good sandwich, so it was fate that brought us here. The sandwiches are loaded and huge! You definitely get what you pay for. However, the bread on my sandwich started to soak up the juices pretty quickly, so it became soggy. Next time we go back,  I'm dining in so that won't happen again."}
{"text":"DONT COME HERE! it's the worst capriottis I've ever been to! It wasn't clean, trash everywhere, the bathrooms were dirty, the employees didn't wash their hands, there was hair in my sandwich, and the manager Ron is a joke! He's the biggest POS I've ever met! Rude, stubborn, always right and just a plain dick. He has no idea what he was talking about. So I'll never come here and I'll help make sure no on else does either!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times. I ordered a sandwich here last night when I got home it wasn't correct. I called them up and they were very nice and apologized, they had already closed but put me in the book for a free one. I called them up today and they re-made it for me no problems, needless to say it was very yummy!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Ate there twice on my trip to Vegas!  It was near my condo (Wyndham Grand Desert).  I got the Philly both times!  You can add sweet and or hot peppers.  We also got the chicken noodle soup twice.  It's small, we didn't eat in.  The staff was super friendly!  I got online to see if there was one near me in Indiana, and sadly there is not :(  A++++++"}
{"text":"I can only speak for my experience.. everyone was super nice and my bobbie was perfect!!!!"}
{"text":"Man am I disappointed!
The Bobbie (only sandwich I get, duh!) was amazing!!! 
But my bundt cake... Not so much!!
Didn't have lemon so I for chocolate which I w had before.. It tasted so fake.. So processed. Like that funky taste in pre made choc cupcakes/cakes. Not good"}
{"text":"First timer here.
I rank it three stars because:
I've had better Italian subs.
The price was way high for just a sandwich without being in a combo.
the cold veggies on the bottom got warm and soggy under the hot meat.

It was still pretty good, and if it weren't for the coupon that printed out, I might not ever go back!

I have heard of this place being famous for the Bobbie, but I don't like that whole thanksgiving sandwich thing. Don't care much for sweet with my salty in a savory type of meal. 
Maybe I'll try something different next time."}
{"text":"Had high hopes with the re-opening and the new ownership in Boulder City, however no such luck. As I walked out with my online order, I asked if the brownie was in the bags. I was told that the brownie was frozen, so the employee put it on the soup to thaw, and no one remembered to put it in the bag, The chicken cheese steak sandwich was dried out and inedible. the Capastrami was good. It did seem like all of the employees were having a good time, so at least there is that. . ."}
{"text":"Place was pretty good..  I guess for a place out there... the pastrami was pretty good... I still prefer The Hat... but I have yet to eat at Katz Deli in NYC....I'd go to that place before I go to Pink's in Planet Hollywood.....ever again...."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite vegetarian sandwich shop in the city! The vegetarian turkey meat is neither salty nor plain and is wonderful with their signature 'Bobbie'.  The Bobbie has to be their greatest creation, a Thanksgiving dinner with turkey, stuffing, mayo, and cranberry inside a french roll. They have other vegetarian options too but I have never tried them. The Bobbie is just too delicious to pass up! I get excited every time I drive past their deli!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Capriotti's Sandwiches for years! First got turned on to them in Vegas back in the 90's.  The Cheese Steak is Steller as are pretty much everything else on the menu.  I love the Bobbie and have found it to be actually better after it's taken home and refrigerated.  I always get it with cranberry sauce on the side!  The Old Town Scottsdale location is consistently good, quick, friendly efficient, and of course extremely excellent Sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's is definitely my favorite sandwich shop in town. The sandwiches are always fresh, and I feel you get a pretty decent deal for your money. My favorites are the Bobbi and the Capastrami. Occasionally, you'll get an offer to do their online survey. As a reward, I've gotten a few bucks off my next sandwich, and even a free small sub. Definitely a must try if you haven't been here before"}
{"text":"4.6/5 Excellent sandwich, got the Italian and was very impressed by the quality of the meat they used. Come hungry, the 12 inch here is a lot more food than the 12 inch at subway. Says voted best sandwich in America, definitely a contender."}
{"text":"I keep giving this location a try but I'm disappointed every time.  Long story short...2 sandwiches ordered, waited 30 minutes asked the girl at the counter why it was taking 30 minutes, she tried to correct me and tell me I was wrong it had only been 16 minutes (wrong). I said okay then...she begrudgingly asked the cooks how long for my food and they told her they gave it to her 20 minutes ago and she gave it to someone (not me).  Nice.  The team argued for about 5 minutes blaming each other.  Finally got my food 15 minutes later.  A quick mumbled sorry and handed my food.  No sincerity and no admitting they screwed up and made me wait almost an hour.  My sandwich was gross, the worst I've ever had at any Capriottis.  I think I need to give up on this place.  Just not worth it."}
{"text":"They keep the menu fairly simple and easy with some neat options for a different flavor. Ever have thanksgiving meal in a sandwich? Ofcourse you have the day after turkey day you know your half tired, still possibly drunk self got up and threw some leftovers together and made a turkey dinner into a sandwich. Well now you don't have to get up and fuss with it, just let the good people here at capriottis handle all of the details. Super hungry order a medium or a damn large, why cause your. Man. A real man. Lol"}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out and I will definitely be back.
Bread: excellent 
Ingredients: excellent
Friendly customer service and fast!"}
{"text":"Used a CapAddicts coupon today Free Upsize to a 12' from a 9'...It felt like they used the 9' steak and put it on a 12' bun...Not as much meat as I've been accustomed to from Cap's BUT still Delish just left me wanting more (I know p.i.g. oink oink)"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!  This is a small (about 5-6 tables), strip mall sandwich shop on the south end of town that grills up some delicious subs and sandwiches right before your eyes.  My family of four enjoyed several of the homemade roast turkey sandwiches (my wife said her hot turkey club had incredible flavor).  I tried their Reuben sandwich - it ranks up there with the best I've had, and will definitely order it again.  During our 5-day stay in Vegas, we stopped by twice for lunch.  These guys work hard for your business!  The service and value are outstanding, and they seem to do an enormous amount of carryout, as witnessed by (literally) grocery sacks of subs going out the door with customers during the lunch hour.  To go with your sandwich order, they also offer a variety of bottled sodas and teas, along with family-sized bags of chips (this was nice, as we purchased one bag of chips to share with everyone), and a couple of (what appeared to be) home baked desserts."}
{"text":"Yummy! Had a capastrami and it was sooooo onolicious! Bread is soft...plenty amount of meat in it...definitely a ! Gonna try all of the items on the menu little by little"}
{"text":"Pros:
--------
Great selection of unique sandwiches and some of the old favorites. Companion had the SlawBeJo - an amazing combination of sliced beef, coleslaw and cheese with Russian Dressing. I had an amazing Grilled Italian sandwich. All the great Italian meats GRILLED and I added some sweet peppers! Mmm....nom nom nom...
Great portions. 12\" sandwich was plenty for me, they do not skimp on meat. 
I think that Firehouse Subs down the block better look out this places BLOWS them away. 

Cons:
--------
No sandwich combos (a side and a drink). 
Need to add wi-fi."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas and we originally ordered from Capriottis on Warm Springs and Eastern but they constantly run out of roast beef and don't tell you until you are ready to pickup your order.  Again disappointed by this specific Capriottis we cancelled our order and went to JJs.  

The sandwich establishments are in different classes but JJs is reliable.  

I would have rated this review a 5 star instead of a 1 star if they would just tell me that they ran out of the specific ingredients before I drive down to be told they ran out of roast beef again.   

I'm a fan of their other locations to include the one in Dallas as they never seem to have a supply shortage."}
{"text":"Normally I like this Capriottis location. The staff is friendly, the place is clean and service is quick. 
This last visit was below the normal standard. We ordered two sandwiches, steak and cheese with onions, mushrooms and peppers and the chicken and cheese with onions, mushrooms and peppers. For some reason the usually tasty, thick, well prepared sandwich was very dry and about half the meat. We were disappointed but will call it an off day and most likely return."}
{"text":"I stopped by this Capriottis location again only because a friend is crushing on one of the employees and wanted to scope out the situation. 
I ordered, she paid $8.00 for, a medium chicken cheese steak with mushrooms, onions and sweet peppers. She got some kind of veggie turkey bobbie or something like that. Veggie and turkey? Hmm... 
Due to the dinner crowd we waited 15 minutes for our sandwiches. My sandwich was dry, sparse and boring. There was barely any chicken or cheese, no flavor and grease would have been a welcome friend to the dry roll. I took about 4 bites and wrapped the rest back up. 
I will not go back to this location and neither will Emily as it seems that the employee is spoken for."}
{"text":"I get it! I'm a vegetarian and you hate me! But wait I have the audacity to add lettuce, tomatoes and mayonnaise ... more veggies to a veggie cheesesteak ... So imagine my surprise when I bite into a nice piece of meat!  

I get mistakes happen ... afterall ... I work in the food and beverage industry ... but when you butcher my sandwich like this ... I cannot help but wonder if my modifications might have pushed you over the edge. 

Did you do it on purpose?    

Should I call and complain?  

So I called and Chanel answers.  Who could not be anymore condescending.

Let me guess you took the order.

When I asked for your store's address and your manager's name, you ask me for my name?  Then proceed to put me on hold for over three minutes?  Did you hope I would just hang up.  

Wish you would have just said sorry.  Manners go along way."}
{"text":"Visited Capriotti's today for a Cheesesteak.

When I walked in during lunch hour literally no one was present behind the counter.  After waiting a bit less than five minutes an employee emerged from the back and took my order.   Little by little after that employees continued to emerge from the back and finally the manager.  I doubt whatever spill they mentioned to me would have required the entire restaurant's staff to clean.

Strangely today the shop wasn't busy nor were all the tables taken as usual.

Aside from the strange service experience the sandwich was wonderful."}
{"text":"I took my brother here when he came out from Ohio to try this place. I technically give this place 4.5 stars but Yelp is a punk.

I arrived and promptly told the cashier that I had no idea how to order. They told me their suggestions and I ordered off that. 

I don't even remember what I ordered, but what they brought was beautiful. My brother and I both had \"special\" sandwhiches (i.e. add this, hold that) and they still made them in an absolute jiffy, maybe 3 minutes during lunch hour!

I'd go back here without hesitation if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Good food. I ordered the Italian sausage sub and it was delicious. Great value for the price. Friendly staff makes your food taste better and they were very polite. I'm from Colorado and personally would like to see a Capriattis there"}
{"text":"As someone already metioned this isn't one of the best locations, but the food is great.

The Bobby is the go-to but the other sandwiches are good, too. May want to call in your order at peak times, it gets pretty busy there.

Also, the mayo on the Bobby is great! Wish I had one right now!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Capriottis.  The Capistrami and cheesesteak make my heart melt.  I will settle for average service and great sandwiches any day of the week.  
I have never had an issue with quality at this location, they are always delicious.  There is sometimes an issue with customer service.  We visit here quite a bit and seems like we have problems with the same couple guys.  They seem grumpy and not happy to be there but they arent neccessarily rude.  The same guy forgot to put my order in 2 visits in a row so we had to wait twice as long.  Not cool.  
The wait is always really long even if there isnt anyone else waiting.  I think they might need better managment or more employees."}
{"text":"I'm a Jersey girl always on the hunt for a good cheesesteak that reminds me of home. Most people don't get it. Thank you for making a cheesesteak that is pretty spot on for what I could get back home. I'll be coming back, for sure."}
{"text":"I think I must be weird, because I knew Capriotti's had won lots of awards (though not recently as far as I could tell from their wall decor) and the reviews here are good, too. But aside from being relatively economical for a huge sandwich, I wasn't super impressed. If VOLUME is your thing, you should drop what you're doing and go there because their specialty seems to be massive sandwiches packed with meat. The small was bigger than I prefer! But if you're interested in eating healthy and watching portion sizes (as I am) and all that boring stuff, not sure I'd recommend Capriotti's. I was a bit sad that they only had shredded iceberg lettuce and a small selection of toppings. The bread was good, though. I guess I'm used to loading up on veggies at that other ubiquitous sandwich place, ha ha. Cap's was just not my thing. But if I took my extremely chubby father in law there, HE would love it."}
{"text":"This review is for the CUSTOMER SERVICE at this location only. Hopefully Capriotti's reads this and realizes that their female black employee whom is trying to look like Rihanna needs some serious customer service skills. She is terrible. I placed a phone order at this location. I walk in to pick it up. I walk up to the front register where she is standing there fiddling around with the register and I stand there, right in front of her. And for about 20 seconds she refuses to even acknowledge my existence, even though I'm standing right there in front of her. I have no problem with you finishing what you need to do but at least acknowledge me and say \"be with you in a minute\" or something like that. But it's a pet peeve of mine when you just ignore me. 

After that she asks what I need I say I am picking up an order. She tells me the amount and I give her my credit card. She hands me the receipt. I sign it and she goes back to fiddling with the register. At this point I figure my order isn't ready yet since she didn't say anything. But as I'm standing at the counter I see my order sitting on the back counter. Completely ready to go and getting cold. So I wait a little bit as she is still staring at the register I say \"is my order ready?\" Without responding to me or even looking at me she just turns around and grabs my sandwiches puts them in a bag and hands it to me. Without saying a word. Without even looking at me, nothing at all.

There are people out there that desperately need a job and then you have ignorant no good people like this who take their job for granted and are miserable at it. Capriotti's you should have a talk with this girl."}
{"text":"Brownie points for this location specifically for being open until 1:00 AM - later than all the others. This is Vegas, why does every other Capriotti's close at 8:00 or 9:00 PM? Anyways, this one is also closest to my house.

It is inside of the Red Rock Hotel so you have to walk through the casino to get to the food court but that is no big deal. I placed an online order and drove to pick it up. Everything went smooth without a hitch."}
{"text":"I've eaten Capriotti's sandwiches before, but tried their catering for the first time at an event over this past weekend. The catering was fabulous - the sandwiches were just as fresh and delicious as the ones in the shop (I probably ate 4 of them for lunch) and the salads were crisp and flavorful. The catering staff was really helpful and professional. Much appreciation for Capriotti's for feeding us at this event, and the sandwiches were delicious!"}
{"text":"I recommend this location only if you want to get what you didn't order then get attitude from the staff for it. I ordered 3 sandwiches and only 1 was right. This explains why the place was empty. If I could give it a half of star I would."}
{"text":"Pros: Sandwiches are good...

Cons: place is dirty as hell. I walked in 30 minutes after they opened and the dining area looked like it just had a bunch of lunch rushes come through and nothing was ever cleaned. I'm gonna go home now and take a bath because I feel filthy for eating here."}
{"text":"Great service and one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The Bobbie is all the best things from the day after thanksgiving. There is a reason it was voted \"Best sandwich in America\"."}
{"text":"The only complaint I could have against this and any other location is that I've been going to Capriotti's for 4 years now and I finally got a survey thing for $3 off! Capastrami is my go-to sandwich, but bobbies are great too just have to be in the mood for one. The service is exceptional, and the location is super convenient. Just a walk across the street when I work and attend class at CSN."}
{"text":"Ordered The Bobbie....was good till I Nearly choked on a turkey bone.  Man...first time visit is our last.   

Friend ordered ham and cheese and asked for extra mayo and mustard and charged for it and it was dry as a bone...like the one i nearly choked on.

Oh well."}
{"text":"Veggie turkey sandwich... Best thing ever!"}
{"text":"yum!!!  i actually ordered cran-slam club... it was good, but i did find the turkey a bit dry...  but my cousins ordered capastrami and the bobbie... so of course i had to take a bite of their sandwiches... the bobbie was soooo yummy!!!!  having tasted my sandwich, i have to say that it's the stuffing that makes the bobbie so yummy and not so dry!!!!  and capastrami was also very good!!!

just found out there's a capriottis in beverly hills...i can't wait to go there and order the bobbie!!!"}
{"text":"The Bobbie, the Italian, even just their regular roast beef and turkey. Just great sandwiches...

Since this location was convenient, I walked in to find that it was pretty darn small, two tables for four and just a handful of two-seaters. To be honest, my first impression was that it was pretty run down, being in an older building. Even the loud level when I walked in was close to being bothersome.

However, as I saw how efficient the staff was servicing their lunch line coming in, showing their appreciation every time a customer generously left a tip saying \"We got beer money, guys!\" followed by hootin' and hollering. The line went amazingly fast, orders being completed and rung up in great speed.

The sandwiches. Not much to say, except the obvious, they are awesome. We ordered a couple of Bobbies, the Grilled Italian, and a turkey sub with all the fixings for me. To top it off, they carry Becky's Bundt Cakes. That day, the flavors they had were marble, carrot cake, and Chocolate Chocolate Chip. We grabbed two of the chocolates. Equally as yummy!

Great sandwiches. Great service. Even though it being very run down, small, and a little loud from the hustle and bustle, this location does an awesome job, that's what matters."}
{"text":"The Bobby is great!  Sometimes they put a little too much cranberry sauce on it, but you have customize it if you ask.  They will even put the cranberry sauce on the side, if you prefer.  

This is definitely a much higher quality sandwich than Subway.  I just wish  they had online ordering or a fax order form like Chipotle."}
{"text":"Love this place! amazing food! Always fresh always good! Love the Bobbie with extra mayo and the capastrami with grilled mushrooms!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are pretty good for the prices. They are freshly made and you can always call ahead if you're in the hurry. Most of the cooks are young guys and they are fun to talk to. I like their cole turkey sandwich and cheese steaks. The food is delicious and you can get your sandwich made which ever way you want to."}
{"text":"HOMEMADE TURKEY SANDWICH. I cant even describe how delicious this sandwich is. Make sure to mention that its your first time there and you get a FREE BROWNIE!!!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood Capriotti's. I've been coming here a couple of times each month since it opened and never been disappointed by quality of food or service. Several of the employee's know my name and they know that I rotate between a couple of sandwiches and try to guess which one I'm going to order that day. (Usually the capastrami or the cole turkey. But sometimes I throw them off with a philly or even a salad.)
One time, the line was really long and my order got lost within some other much larger orders. So, they made me a medium instead of a small sandwich, apologized profusely, and gave me my whole lunch for free.
Yesterday, I took a good friend there. Somehow, despite living in town for years, he had never been to a Capriotti's anywhere. He said - and I quote - \"This is the best meatball sub I have ever had!\""}
{"text":"Tried calling ahead to place an order and they would not answer the phone. Once we arrived, it was not busy and their phone was ringing and they were intentionally ignoring it! Great customer service...."}
{"text":"every sandwich i order is wrong. every single time. then the employees deb and the man who worked the 5:30 shift on 5/11/17 hang up on you when you call to correct the order. yes i am upset, and no it's not a .99 burger- it's an investment at their prices. they could at least get it right once in a while.  they said that online orders are problematic because they are told they have to lather it up in mayo, though i have not asked for it. THOSE WERE MY LAST TWO SANDWICHES ALL MAYOED UP. ALL I WANTED THIS TIME WAS PEPPERS, AND NOW TOLD THOSE AREN'T NORMAL!? so i now call to order in and still wrong. the only thing they have going for them is riding the reputation of other capriottis. this franchise sucks!"}
{"text":"Went to Capriotti's for lunch with my wife. Since she is a vegetarian, this place doesn't have your ordinary vegetable medley of spinach,lettuce, tomato,etc. type of sandwiches. My wife had a small (9\") turkey and cheese with cold slaw and some dressing. It has been about 30 years since she has had \"real turkey\". She said it tasted just like she remembered and it was a very good sandwich.
I had a medium (12\") chicken cheese stake with provolone cheese and sweet peppers (no onions). The bread is soft and chewy. I was pretty dame good. 
We talked to the owner about the \"fake\" turkey. He said it was soy based. He recommended my wife try there veggie cheeseburger next time. 
I will try something different myself the next time out. This place is a great find since there aren't gems of a place like this in Oregon."}
{"text":"I had the largest cheesesteak I've ever eaten. Really good flavor. The pastrami is delicious."}
{"text":"We ordered the Capristrammi sub and the turkey cranberry sandwich. Those who started eating the turkey sandwich stopped and ate the Capristrammi sub after they tasted the awesomeness of that sub."}
{"text":"Not many options. Sandwiches bland. Roast beef dry and shredded."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is just not for me.  I have tried the Bobbie twice, it is just not that interesting.  Thanksgiving is once a year for a reason.  Plus having this as a random sandwich shop is much too heavy from a deli.  It just doesn't make sense to me.  Nothing else looked or sounded appealing either.  After 3 visits, Capriotti's is not a stop for me."}
{"text":"This is my local Capriottis and I try to dine here at least once a week!!! The folks are always very accommodating and not afraid to spice things up for me (literally). Calling in orders is great when you're on the go and the survey for $3 off on the next visit within 30 days makes it really affordable!"}
{"text":"Usually go in for dinner but never get to order because they are always out of meatballs after 5 it seems.  Go to the one of LV blvd and Silverado Ranch.  Always have what I want no matter what time."}
{"text":"I tried The Bobbie and it was hands-down the best sandwich I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  It is seriously That Good, I highly recommend this if you are a lover of everything Thanksgiving. The turkey they roast and hand pull from the bone, add cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo...Incredible!"}
{"text":"My stay in Vegas would not be complete unless I get a Capriotti's sandwich. Portions are large. I can split a small sandwich with my friend and he's a big eater. I usually get the proscuitini and my other friends are big with the Bobbie. 

Anytime I have a friend visiting Vegas with me I always take them to Capriotti's because it simply rocks. The only thing is that I usually need to drink tons of water to flush out all the salt, but worth it. Its my personal thing. The other bummer is that I'll have to make gluten free adjustments to my food."}
{"text":"This is a sad place where dreams go to die. Today I ordered delivery from Capriotti's. It was a touch after 11:30a and the delivery time was slated for an hour. I sat back turned on a football game, washed some dishes, and played with the dog. Knowing that it was prime lunch time, after an hour twenty I called the restaurant to check on my order. The pleasant young woman who answered the phone assured me that they had gotten busy, but my order was on its way. After another 20 minutes,  I called back, worried that perhaps my order had been forgotten after almost an hour. She apologized, and offered discounts and coupons for the delay, but assured me again that the order was on its way. After almost 3 hours and speaking with a manager, the crack team finally admitted that they had never made the order, let me waste my time waiting for it, and it would not be arriving. Don't bother with this joke of a sandwich shop. They offered no acceptable attempt to recover the situation and lied to me for almost three hours. I'm not sure why they felt the need to lie. That is what upsets me the most."}
{"text":"Fresh and juicy sandwiches, which one can eat during the road trip. 
I would say the stuff is a little slow but I think it is a normal speed of service in this area."}
{"text":"one New Year's resolution is to write more Yelp reviews, so here goes...

In Vegas for NYE & gave this place a shot per other Yelp reviews. I had the Capistrami & the girlfriend had the Cheese Steak, which I had few bites of. Both were absolutely delicious in an awesome-deli-sandwich-sort-of-way. The shop is no-frills with only some bar seating, but the sandwiches are really reasonably priced. So if all you're after is a fantastic deli sandwich, definitely go."}
{"text":"Second best cheesestaek I've had outside of Philly. For a chain they saty really consistent. I wish the meat was chopped a little better at time but that's the philly talking. They also have tastykakes:)))"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love Capriotti's??  This is a great location for us on campus who are in the mood for tasty sandwiches. It is not a cheap lunch, is you're a broke college student like me and cheap means using the \"Buy one get one free bean and cheese burrito\" coupon for Del Taco. It usually costs about $20 whenever I go (with one other person). 

GREAT FOR VEGETARIANS! - I love their veggie cheese steak and veggie cheseburger - and even non-veggies think it is tasty, too!! Veggie sandwiches do take a bit longer than non-veggie ones. It's annoying to never have hot sandwich options at a sub joint, but Cappriotti's goes beyond what you'd expect and doesn't make you feel like you're compromising taste by not getting meat. 

Everything is cooked to order, but I don't think I've waited more than 10-12 min. even when it was rush hour. 

I keep wanting to try everything on the menu but I'm addicted to my usuals!! I give Capriotti's five stars because it has never disappointed, and exceeds expectation. This is my go-to spot for a \"splurge\" lunch."}
{"text":"I ordered the homemade turkey sandwich and I got lettuce tomatoes cheese and pulled turkey thrown in shabbily between two slices of bread. The messiest and most unappealing looking sandwich I ever ate. Tasteless too. Don't even bother eating here. I'm sure Walmart, which is at a walking distance from this place, can make a better sandwich."}
{"text":"I went elsewhere to pick my dinner up because they didn't think it important to include a phone number. It doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"Walked all the way there on my lunch hour only to get back to the office and realize my order was wrong. Gotta love it!"}
{"text":"I live in southern highlands and everyone goes to the shop on Silverado because it's way better quality... except today. I think they forgot the rest of the meat, peppers, and mushrooms. I ordered the 20\" ($18). Guess we need to find a better philly place"}
{"text":"Called in an order of 4 sandwiches. Asked the greeter and the checkout guy to make sure they added onions and peppers to the cheese steak sandwiches and both said yes. Got home and gave them to my guests... Dry dry dry. Barely any meat and no peppers or onions. Called to complain and guy says \"to be honest, nothing will happen\". He was nice and sincerely felt bad but knew the outcome of the situation. No manager for 2 days. I should've took the advice of the other yelpers and gone to the silverado location."}
{"text":"I just order chicken cheese steaks it's so fresh n delicious 
I love it!!  so I definitely recommend for you guys"}
{"text":"I like my Bobbie gutted with extra cran. Gutted is when they take the inside of the bread out and have the outer shell. This place does it right ALL the time."}
{"text":"I have eaten here too many times to count and all I can say is amazing food and great service. Thanks to the senior vp Jason in Vegas telling me about this place on twitter or else I would never have found it.  I love the Capastrami, the Bobby and Italian."}
{"text":"I come to this location all the time and I always and I do mean always get great service. Kyle and Terrell are great, they always get the order right and it's always fresh thanks guys."}
{"text":"***AVOID THIS SANDWICH SHOP***

First of all the main reason to not support this Capriottis is the poor management/ownership. If you care about being treated right as a customer, being valued for your business and overall being treated respectfully by a business... DO NOT GO HERE.

Here's my story...
Capriotti's food in general as a chain sub shop can be very good. In fact I have ate there several times in the past, mostly from another location. But it is more expensive as some of the other posters have remarked. (So you'd like to get what you pay for correct? Certainly you can... BUT NOT HERE)

This location created a texting system for deals etc.. (I believe to drum up business when it's slow). They say in it \"UPSIDE ANY SANDWICH to a 20: FOR THE PRICE OF A SMALL\". I phone order, come in expecting to pay for a small and get ther large as advertised in their text. Not only did they NOT HONOR their own promotion. When the owner/manager got into it with me. He absolutely understood the confusion but WOULD NOT HONOR THE TEXT??? I asked him whether he'd rather lose return customers and have bad business in the future over his mistakes rather than rectify them on this one time basis. He had no interest in making things right. As I've read from other posters from a while back this ownership has no clue and hopefully we will all stand and let him know that businesses like this shouldn't be rewarded."}
{"text":"Love it! - totally fresh take on sandwiches. The ingredients are awesome and the bread is incredible.  Turkey is real not butterball slices. The mix of white meat and dark meat is super good.

You have to try it."}
{"text":"I try to stop here every time I am in vegas awesome sandwiches with amazing bread. I have tried a few and although it might sound a little unusual when you read it \"turkey dinner on a sandwich?\" They have all been super good. 

Wish they had locations near my home in Utah."}
{"text":"Very large and delicious sandwich. If you like spicy like i do, i recommend the Grilled Italian with hot peppers!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's up with all these negative reviews. 
I live in the area and have been coming to this location for a very long time. 
The employees here have always been very friendly and the food is consistently delicious and ready in a sufficient amount of time. 
I came in tonight around 5pm ordered 2 hot sandwiches to go and I was out of there in about 10-15 minutes. There were about 8 other people coming and going at the same time. 
If you are looking for a fast food cold cut go down the street and have a processed pile of crap at subway, they will have you slapped together and out of there in a few minutes. 
If you prefer a fresh made to order delicious home made tasting sandwich come here and be patient, it's worth a slight wait. 
Yummmmm.....the Bobbi never disappoints that thanksgiving craving."}
{"text":"I don't understand how there is an operating Subway restaurant catty corner from here. The prices at Capriotti's are comparable to Subway and you get a far superior sandwich at Capriotti's. I'm a fan of the cold Italian sub made with Genoa salami, capacolla, and prosciuttini but \"The Bobbie\" is the crowd favorite. Essentially a Thanksgiving dinner, this sandwich sports home-made turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. I'm not saying a sandwich SHOULD be a religious experience, but it doesn't hurt."}
{"text":"Omg, this place has some delicious sandwiches, my manager and I order from there sometimes during our lunch and they always seem to satisfy those yummy cravings. Totally recommend going there, my favorite sandwich is The Bobbie  delicious"}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop ever! Try the cheese steak it will blow your mind!!! It's hard to stay away from this place. The Bobby is also a favorite it's like having thanksgiving dinner anytime of the year and it's on a sandwich!"}
{"text":"OMG the Capastrami here is soooooo good! We always get a couple of large sandwiches to share, it looks like it could be a foot and half or more. The pastrami is so juicy and really flavorful. Perfect amount of seasoning, not too salty like a lot of pastrami shops. They also throw in some Swiss cheese, which melts with the hot pastrami. I love love love their cole slaw they put in the sandwich. Its really creamy and a lil sweet to contrast with the flavor of the pastrami. The Russian sauce (Thousand Island dressing?) compliments the meat and slaw well too. I don't know if it was because I was drinking outside by the pool all morning or what, but I probably could have finished most of that \"large\" Capastrami in one sitting. It was so good! Thank god, I went to the pool prior to eating this... Or else it would not have been good for my bikini body! Haha"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches, period. I've had the Bobbie, Capastrami, and Slaw Be Jo. They're all excellent but my favorite outta the bunch is the Capastrami. Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw never tasted to good together. The bread they use is pretty damn good too.  The prices are a little higher compared to a subway or quiznos, but for the quality of food you're getting and the friendly service, it can't be beat."}
{"text":"Whenever I go to a new place for the first time I usually try to order the signature item. In this case it's the Bobbie. Great sandwich. Bread is soft and fresh. Turkey is made in house and the whole sandwich put together is your best effort on a next day, left over Thanksgiving Turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"Food was great!! Really fresh. I had title with cole slaw. They use fresh shredded turkey, not thin deli slices. Yum!!! Sandwiches are big too. Kids meals came with Craisans which is mice for a change. Only reason I didn't give 5's is because music was too loud to talk to each other. We had a hard time ordering because we couldn't hear the girl."}
{"text":"They make the best philly cheese steak I have ever ate. Super friendly staff. Great service. Do not have to wait forever to get your sandwich. Easy location to get in and out of. Make sure you try it at least once, and I promise you'll be back."}
{"text":"Tasty sandwich.  I got the 9\" Capastrami.  Pretty different flavors & textures than what I'm used to and it was soooo good!  The last thing we need is yet another version of Subway/Jersey Mike's/Jimmy John's etc etc.  The fresh baked and pulled meat is super delicious.  I had exceptional service.  Joe walked me through all the varieties of sandwiches and told me all about her favorites.  The two guys in the food prep area also both greeted me & wished me a good evening when I left.  Friendly, fast, overall great!"}
{"text":"If you are a Cap's fan, this location is great. There is a location by my area on Rainbow and 215, but Johnny and I drive the extra mile to come here because I am in love with their sugar cookies. They're so soft, chewy with crispy edges. The people are nice and friendly too.

 One time, I ordered a chicken cheese steak to go for my boyfriend when he wasn't with me and they accidentally made me a regular cheesesteak. No problem. They apologized and I waited for the right order. I didn't realize until I got the chicken cheese steak that they insisted me to keep the other one for free because they made the mistake. Now that's customer service. 

I personally like cheesesteaks, but when I'm in a refreshing type of mood, Capastrami for me please."}
{"text":"Horrible, go to jimmy johns across the street , stopped by to get a quick sandwich , the staff was horrible , food looked mediocre, avoid!! We had the worst experience here of any restaurant in  Arizona."}
{"text":"Certainly not the best sandwich I ever had. When I stopped in after passing the billboards making these types out outrageous claims I thought I was in for a treat. 

Turns out I found the layout to be confusing along with the menu options. Staff didn't seem to helpful and the dining room area was dirty to the point where I had to clean my own table. 

The food wasn't bad but in my opinion didn't support the claims. It was a regular turkey sub with some extras, nothing special about it. If I'd had to make a life of death choice between Capriotti's or Subway I'd go with Caps. 

The choice is yours..."}
{"text":"no doubt dont doubt the other reivews
these sandwichs are banging

{"text":"Colton was awesome! My daughter and I have never been to a Capriotti's before and he made our ordering fun and easy! We will definitely be back!

After eating our sandwiches we would love to say that they were absolutely delicious! I had a turkey, my daughter had an Italian and my husband had a steak and cheese with hot peppers. They were all scrumptious!! Thanks again"}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are pretty good, I ate the cheesestake and the Bobbie.  

The cheese stake is pretty much a philly cheese steak, so nothing new there but tastes good.

The bobbie is pretty much thanksgiving leftovers into a sandwich; you have the turkey, mayo, stuffings, and cranberry for the sweet flavor.  Quite good.

Pricing is reasonable and their size can get up to 20 inches."}
{"text":"First time at a Capriotti's and I liked it!
Fast, fresh and good value. My wife had a philly cheese steak and I had the turkey cranberry and stuffing sandwich. Not what I would normally try but I guess I was in a turkey mood, it's a good sandwich.
We will return!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! This is our go to sandwich place. The staff is always friendly and they have fresh meat. Their turkey is real turkey, not deli meat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were very upset with this place! We had never been there before and so we took a chance, never again. The employee who helped us was very rude, and didn't make our sandwiches right, and of course we didn't find out until we got home. All around we will never return, due to the terrible service and quality of the food."}
{"text":"Always a great sandwich here. from the Capristrami to the Bobbie you can never go wrong with a sub from Cariottis. Soft bread and full of fillings there consistency among their chain is very admirable as far as chair restaurants go. I'm lucky to have one right across the street from where I live. Youll pay a bit more than a sandwich from Subways but it's worth it extra buck or two."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! Tried to place an online order and found out as I was trying to pay their online ordering service wasn't working.  Called and placed and order.  She never read it back and when I asked about paying by credit card I realized that she had hung up on me.  Called back again to trying to ask if i could pay by credit card and was hung up on.  Called back again and cancelled the order.  Never using this location again!"}
{"text":"Never coming back here again. Been here three times and every time they have us wait over 20 minutes for a salad and a sandwich. And for some reason that they always get something on my order wrong. To top it off the customer service is TERRIBLE. All the girls behind the counter give attitude because everyone complains about how long it's taking. I understand to be stressed out when you're busy but there's more than four girls up front and who knows how many in back, there's no need for us to wait SO LONG for our food when there's three people in the entire place. I just regret spending money here."}
{"text":"Back in the day, Capriotti's used to have only one location and 20 years ago I ate there in Rhehoboth Beach, DE. The cheesesteaks were what what made them famous, but now everybody likes their turkey, except me. They still use dark and white meat mixture for their turkey sandwiches, a big red flag for me, signifying cheapness and indifference to customer demands and the culture of today. They should have switched to all-white years ago. Ok, knowing all that, I went with the small chicken cheesesteak and this was a solid hot sandwich with the free addition of onions and sweet peppers. With a bag of chips, the price was under 9 bucks. Not a great deal, but if you see a capriotti's at least you know it will be a solid meal at almost any location."}
{"text":"The Bobbie was to die for! Like an explosion of thanksgiving in my mouth! Delivery guy was a bit slow, though the sandwich quality more than made up for it!"}
{"text":"went and  place my order first time here the cashier was on training I didn't know that you have to tell them what you want on the sandwich he didn't ask me so I end up with plain sandwich i explain to themif they can add some lettuce and tomatoes anyway lack of costumer service and rude staff first and last time come here!"}
{"text":"I already love capriottis sandwiches ! But this location is amazing, customer service was great. & my sandwich was made perfectly even though I made some changes to my sandwich. Not to mention they're open 24 hours."}
{"text":"First time here and it was really really good plus they are open 24hrs. I recommend the pastrami well done"}
{"text":"Don't bother calling in an order. If they tell you a time it will be off by at least thirty minutes. Terrible service. Great food tho."}
{"text":"The food here is so delicious but the customer service wasn't the greatest. When I ordered my sandwich i was asked if I wanted a drink and I said I wanted a water from the fridge that they have behind the counter. He said they would give it to me when I paid. When my food was finally ready a different employee took my money but was talking to a man that looked homeless the entire time. I asked for my water but he was so busy with his conversation that he didn't hear me. It's not a big deal because its only water but I thought it was rude for him to have a personal conversation while I was trying to ask him for something and pay so I just gave him my money and left"}
{"text":"Great food but the management needs to check on the employees!  We have been calling for the last hour with no answer.. we wanted to place an order for pick up.  It says they close at 8pm on Saturday and we called at 4pm.  We drove all the way over during our break to find out they have their phone off the hook.  Not a very good way to run a business."}
{"text":"Had to place a catering order for a special event at work and was a bit worried since everything had to be perfect . . . and it was!  We will definitely use them again.  Even tho there are Capriotti's closer to my office, since I have used this one before, I knew that I could trust that they sandwiches would be made \"nicely\"."}
{"text":"I rounded out my Vegas trip with a stop here. The bread rolls are made fresh at Capriotti's every morning using a secret recipe. There are three sandwich sizes: small (9\"), medium (12\"), and large (20\").

The original concept here was to appeal to the turkey lovers, and it's no surprise that the \"Bobbie\" became the signature sandwich here. Sliced turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing, all homemade. About 10-12 turkeys are roasted each night. Workers usually begin the day's prep from about 5:30 a.m.

As much as I wanted to stuff my face with a 20\" sandwich, I just got a foot-long Bobbie instead ($8.19). The sandwich is wrapped in white butcher paper. Delicious soft bread here. It's a good thing it's a thick loaf for all the turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing put into this guy. The cranberry sauce had a slight tartness that worked well with the turkey and stuffing. I found the turkey to be slightly on the dry side. The foot-long sub satisfied my appetite, but I'm sure I coulda handled the 20\" sandwich without any problems.

I'm one of those guys that usually prefers toasted bread, no matter what's on it. Still, I enjoyed having a fresh, soft loaf for this sandwich.

I'm a fan of virtually any establishment that gives me a meal filled with fresh, homemade ingredients. There's no substitute for all those hours of labor. I see awesome hot options like cheesesteaks, meatball subs, and Italian sausage subs. Cold subs include turkey, roast beef, and tuna options.

Great service and a friendly feel overall. They say you'll \"feel like part of the family every time you walk in the door and walk out with a smile.\" Mission accomplished."}
{"text":"Roast beef was chopped and certainly not rare or medium rare beef as expected, on wheat bread, was ok.  The clam chowder had few clam pieces and those that were there were mere slivers - and a potato chunk or two.  Why bother?"}
{"text":"Cran-slam club, very different! Turkey is delish... the bread was really soft and I enjoyed it. tRY IT! =)"}
{"text":"Soo good, get the turkey sub /w cranberry.

WOW!"}
{"text":"Kimberly Gale was great. She was very nice and good at her job. Took my order really fast and knew what I wanted. Food was great. Will be back."}
{"text":"There service at times is not up to the standard set by the other Capriottis intown, but there sandwiched are the 2nd best in town, which is more then worth coming.

I'm a vegetarian, and its nice to go to a sandwich shop that not only is there a sandwich I can eat, but I have a selection.  I prefer to get the Vegan Cheese-steak with Coleslaw and Russian dressing, it takes just like a Caprastromi, and was told to me A VP of Capriottis on Twitter 2yrs ago."}
{"text":"This is by far the Best Capriottis in town. They are always nice, and make the best Sandwich's.  The best people there are the guys at night, before they close, its always worth the drive across town just to go to this one.

{"text":"The best sandwiches ever hands down. Try the Capastrami, pastrami, cole slaw, russian dressing and melted provolone. You wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's. My mouth waters when I hear the word Bobbie....but....this was the slowest service I've ever received at any location. We waited 20 mins for two bobbies and two kids sandwiches...at 10 in the morning....WITH 2 CUSTOMERS total. I was frustrated. Once we got home, and I started devouring my favorite sandwich, I found the ingredients were not distributed evenly throughout the sandwich and led me to get bites of just cranberry or just stuffing. I was pretty disappointed in this experience but still chose to give 2 stars for the cleanliness of the restaurant and because it was, in fact, a Bobbie."}
{"text":"Poor customer service at this location. I had ordered a steak sandwich and they charged me for something but didn't put it on the steak. No biggie, I didn't say anything at the time. I ordered the same sandwich a few weeks later, same missing ingredient. I called the manger, Million, and he told me he'd take care of me no prob and send me a gift card. Wait a few weeks, no gift card. I talked to him and and he promised he'd drop a gift card in the mail again. Now 2 weeks have passed, nothing. Apparently he has a million better things to do than keep his word and take care of customers. Fail!"}
{"text":"I stopped her on the way home from work this weekend.  The sandwiches are interesting.  The one I had was called the Bobi, it was literally like Thanksgiving on a bun.  Food was pretty good. Good location."}
{"text":"I like the food and the employees are nice enough when I go in but DAMN are they slow."}
{"text":"I just don't like it. I've tried most every sandwich they have, and while the bread is soft, there is WAY too much of it in relation to the amount of meat you receive, and so little flavor on the sandwiches--even when you think there should be. Coleslaw and dressing should have flavor. Thanksgiving should have flavor. Even their chips are generic. This location seemed very run down, the radio station was blaring so loudly the cashier couldn't hear me, and the strip mall it is in was cruddy. I'll pass."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in Vegas. Not so much.. The Bobbie is just nasty in my opinion. Cold stuffing, cranberry sauce and turkey that taste like some day old turkey leftovers from thanksgiving. Way over hyped and expensive. Any chain sandwich spot would easily provide you a better meal."}
{"text":"First of all

I am not a big fan of sandwiches or american cuisine.

Having said that I love the bobby, the bread was delicious and the combination of toppings inside the sandwich will lead to mouth orgasms. 

The cheesesteak was ordinary. 

Get the bobby, its what sets them apart from the rest :)"}
{"text":"Go Capriotti's!!!!! I grew up eating these subs on the east coast and they somehow managed to keep the same great taste. LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"Will not go to this capriotti's shop ever again. We ordered cheese steak and there are no cheese, just meat and it tasted awful.  We bought some cookies and sodas as well but the cashier/order taker didnt offer any bags."}
{"text":"Have always been very pleased with the level of service and quality of food at this location. I have tried other Capriottis in town and this one ranks quite high on my list. Definitely recommend...."}
{"text":"The service here is abominable. I have been to other Capriottis around town, and although this location does open early at 8am, the staff friendliness and the food are equally sub-par. Total visits to this location in the past 90 days? Four. Likely not to ever return to this location. It's a shame really since it reflects on Capriottis as a whole."}
{"text":"I'm going to take it on faith that the bobbie is just as good or better than the sandwiches I've tasted here - the capastrami, the philly cheesesteak, and the slawbejoe.  And all three of those are top tier. 

 And among the three, the Slawbejoe stands out.  It's got to be one of the best variations of a roast beef sandwich I've had. The meat was tender and flavorful, and the cole slaw and Russian dressing complemented it nicely.  The capastrami is the same deal except with pastrami, still A-1, but the combination just worked better with the roast beef.  I normally not a philly cheesesteak person, but here, the steak is juicy and flavorful, and it's got just enough of a kick to it for me to enjoy it.

The portion size match the prices, and the taste goes above and beyond.  If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Nice little sand which shop across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel on Paradise ave. had the philly cheese steak with hot peppers.  Pretty tasty.  The sandwiches come in a small(9\"), medium(12\") and for the super  hungry or people looking to share there is a large(20\") sand which"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sandwhich shop fan. I probably have subway once every 2 yrs. I went to vegas and after 2 different buffets I was pretty burnt out on basically everything you could think of eating. Then it hit me, I hadn't had a bobby in at least a decade! It was about 20minutes tiL closing time and I think that's where I went wrong. The bread they used was stale and almost hard. With the exception of the gross bread, my Bobby was decent. If Jimmy Johns offered this sandwhich I'd be all over it! I'll give capriottis another shot, but it will be closer to opening time."}
{"text":"Love Capriotti's!!! Everytime we go to Vegas, we have to come here! All of the hot sandwiches are delicious, but my favorite is the Capastrami, soooo good. Make sure to get a side the pickled sweet peppers too, they're delicious. This last time we went we also got the cinnamon mini bunt cake. I wasn't expecting it to be anything special but it was soooo good. It tasted like a cinnabon but wonderfully fluffy and light like cake, and it melted in your mouth! We also tried the chocolate one which really wasn't anything special. Captriotti's is definitely a must stop if you're going to be in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I love capriottis. Staff always friendly and pleasant. I have never had anything i didnt like."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich I have ever had. Got the roast beef sub. So dry like eating cardboard. Took 2 bites and threw the rest away. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with their cheesesteak.  Get the large and it'll feed 2-3 people easily.  Another must stop each time I'm in vegas.  I would recommend placing your order by phone and then going to pick up.  Sometimes the wait could be 20-30 mins at peak times of the day."}
{"text":"I love the Philly here, Amazing!!! Staff and management at this location are very friendly!! My stomach is now complete. I live close so it's convenient. But I'd drive past other Sandwich Shops, just to grub here :)"}
{"text":"I'm done with this location. Never again.  I could excuse the customer service only because the girl was new.  But the food was absolutely inexcusable. My husband opened his Italian sub and the meat smelled spoiled.  At first I thought he was over exaggerating until I found a live nat squished in my turkey sandwich.  It was still moving and attached the turkey.  It's been hit or miss with this location and I've only gone there because it is right around the corner.  I would rather drive down to the Anne Oakley location because at least I know the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Love capppritotis.. just not this location. It has been Over 20 min for 4 subs?? Crazy.  We still don't have them!!"}
{"text":"These guys rock! My business is just around the corner and we order from them almost every Saturday. Even when they're busy they have our food order (always 5+ people) ready crazy quick! always quality, no complaints"}
{"text":"Badda-Boom, Badda-Bing... We have a winner! I used to frequent this establishment in Las Vegas when I lived there, and now, all of a sudden, 17 years later... I work down the street from this place! Yippee for me! Clean well-run, friendly joint, with GREAT sandwiches. Try this place out, and remember... Friends don't let friends eat at Subway."}
{"text":"I see this spot all the time going to work and just stopped here today. It's soooo good! Prices are great and food is fantastic"}
{"text":"Well, 30 minutes to make 2 turkey sandwiches with nothing on them. Seriously. 30 minutes. Just turkey and bread.  Don't lose 30 minutes of your life wasting it here."}
{"text":"Store was empty and even looked closed. The store was dirty for how dead it was. The food was fresh and tasty. The workers behind the counter were friendly."}
{"text":"Bland bland bland. I've tried several sandwiches in several locations. Not impressed. They sound great: coleslaw on turkey, a thanksgiving meal on a bun? Hell yeah. But then, not so much on the actual taste. They are large."}
{"text":"When I first moved here in Vegas, I saw this sandwich shop so many times on my way home. It was almost like my guide home. So, I started thinking maybe this is just Vegas' version of Subway. Oh, but never in this life time will it ever be compared to Subway. My friends took me here after church. Apparently you have to eat after church, cus it just completes the service.

All I kept hearing was, \"Try the Bobbie\", \"Try the Capastrami.\" I am more of a hot sandwich person so, I went with the Capastrami. It was the greatest decision I've made at a sanwich shop. Kinda makes me wish I made great decisions like this throughout my life. 

So, anyway about the sandwich.. It was this prefect hot, juicy pastrami that laid on a cold bed of some kind of coleslaw. With this peppery Russian sauce to top it off. I always get extra russian sauce on the side. This sandwich always satisfies my hunger everytime.

I tried the Bobby another time. It is a cold sandwich, but it's unique. It's basically a thanksgiving lunch. It has the turkey, bread stuffing, cranberries and cranberry sauce.. It's just as good as the capastrami.

I also tried this sandwich called eggplant Parmesan. It's absolutely filling for a no meat sandwich. So much flavor. Now I ave yet to try the rest.

They also sell tastykakes! Those deliciously moist krimpets."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were made to order, the aroma of the food cooking on the hot grill teasing my nostrils, this place is legit.

You get to choose most of the sandwiches from Small, Medium, and Large.  I ordered Mediums, thinking of Subway ... but the sandwiches were much bigger.  They say the medium is 12\" long, but they seem longer than subways 12\" (hey, no laughing)

Ordered several sandwiches:
Capastrami
Cran-Slam Club
Chicken Cheese Steak
Homemade Meatball Sub

Demanding a bite of each, the two that I liked a lot were the Capastrami & the Cran-Slam Club.  The Capastrami had thick tender slices of hot pastrami that was full of flavor, had a nice pink color, and wasn't dripping with oil (like some places).  The Cran-Slam club had fresh slow-roasted Turkey that was super moist and delicate, not dry and brittle.

I heard that they will be opening locations near my house which is good.  Once that happens, I won't be as jealous about my cousins living so close to this location."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to stop in at after a long day. They took the time to learn my name and order. I am greeted when i come in and the wait is almost always shorter than expected. 
Just be aware that they do get busy in the evenings as people grab dinner on their way home.

The bobby is great, but the chicken cheese steak is my favorite. Always hot and yummy. Great sandwhich and the price is decent."}
{"text":"CAPRIOTTI'S!!! Y U NO get my order right??

I came to this location for the first time today and ordered four sandwiches. Two of the four came out right.

My sister is boring and she likes her sandwiches with almost nothing on them. I am the opposite. I like my sandwiches Primanti's-style--filled to the brim and only edible if you kind of tilt your head sideways and gnaw at them. So, you can imagine my sadness when I got home and my sandwich turned out to be the vegetarian version of my sister's (turkey, cheese, lettuce.) It was a mere ghost of what a sandwich should be. I even asked for pickles and of course, there were no pickles. :(

The other issue is that I asked for wheat on my sister's sandwich. Maybe there was a communication problem, since the person who took my order handed it off to someone else.

On the plus side, my sandwich was good (at least the \"meat\" was correct!) and the employees could not have been nicer. Capriotti's sandwiches are so good that I'll keep coming back despite service issues (until I find a replacement.)"}
{"text":"You can find bad service anywhere in vegas.  I don't like it but I try to grin and bear and just get thru it.  I will not however put up with people yelling at me.  

I've heard for years how this sandwich shop is so good so on a whim I decided to try it while making some errands.  So I go up to the counter and they guy says \"what's your order, MAN?\".  \"I want a capastrami.\".  \"do you want anything special on that, MAN?\".  \"no\".  \"your order is $10.58, MAN\", then when he gives my change he starts rattling off some gibberish which I couldn't understand.  

I was supposed to make a phone call but it was impossible in this place because it's so small and noisy so I went outside but they have this music blasting over a speaker just outside the door, so I gave up and went back in.  I took a table near the order desk and my name was called fairly quickly but when I got up and walked two steps over to the counter, this woman is still packing my order.  So I not only have to stand there and wait but I also have to dodge the people coming out behind the counter to deliver orders inside.  Really?  If I order something to go, I have to wait for them to call my name and then wait while they pack my order but if I order it inside they deliver????  Geez, really?  I didn't say anything; I'm not telling anybody how to do their job.   I took the order and started to walk out and I guess this woman behind the counter didn't like my attitude and so she says \"have a nice day\", and then again \"have a nice day\" and by the time I got out the door she was shouting it \"HAVE A NICE DAY\". 

THERE'S NO FRUITY EXCUSE FOR THIS NONSENSE FOLKS.  I DON'T WORK FOR YOU AND YOU'RE LUCKY I DIDN'T LOSE MY TEMPER AND MAKE A SCENE OF IT. The sandwich was way over priced but it was pretty good, however, this chain of stores can go FRUIT themselves before I ever go back."}
{"text":"stopped in this spot you get some lunch, was happy with the meal.

the sandwich tasted fresh, I had no issues with the food at all. only issue I had was the time to get the sandwich. felt like it took longer then I expected and there was only 2 other customers in there.

I will go back. made a fan."}
{"text":"I basically come here at least once every time I visit Vegas.  I also try to pick up some stuff for the car ride home.  I highly recommend the Capastrami, Bobbie, and Italian (add some sweet peppers to this one).  I'd probably recommend the rest, but I haven't had them yet.

Delicious bread and fresh ingredients.  Great food for cheap?  You won't find that on the strip..."}
{"text":"Great sandwich! I had the capastrami and it's was fantastic! The coleslaw on my sandwich was really good! They had Pepsi products and dr pepper always a plus! I asked for a meatball sample that was ok! Glad I didn't order that as my sandwich! My husband ordered the Italian and really liked it!.... 5 stars for a sandwich shop ;)...... Doshie from Roseville,CA"}
{"text":"I will give this place zero stars.  Corporate Capriotti's needs to be aware of this franchise and all of the trouble it is doing to it's name.  First of all the owner does not require the employees to have a health card, so your sandwiches are being made by employees not even wearing gloves or understanding the health basics of handling food correctly.  Food poisoning for sure.  One of the employees named Steve, lives in there, he's a homeless meth addict, that beats his son with a baseball bat that also works there, he carries a concealed weapon illegally, no permit and threatens people telling them if they confront him there will be blood shed.  Metro has been notified.  This is a dysfunctional place, the owner Tim is to blame.  It is an unsafe place for anyone to go into to order food or to eat.  Beware this place is very bad news, it could warrant a trip to the ER if you go here.  The Caps on LV Blvd and Silverado Ranch is a way better place to be."}
{"text":"Sub was huge, I had the 20\" Bobbi and loved it but def couldn't finish the whole sub.. I'll def be back to try some of the other subs that they offer"}
{"text":"I found this place while perusing Yelp for a place to eat that was within walking distance of the hotel. After reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I had to try it... and I was not disappointed.

I ordered \"The Bobbie\" which is essentially Thanksgiving leftovers on a sub -- Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing, and Mayo. It immediately brought me back to the day after Thanksgiving. A sandwich that is classic, but absolutely delicious.

Service can be a little slow if there's an influx of customers, but not a deal-breaker. A great sandwich shop that I look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Check out the photo posted of medium sized black hairs on or in my sandwich. There were so many hairs that it seems like I purchased a side of hair for 75 cents. It was a woman named Andrea who made my sandwich on a call-in order. She called me \"hun\" on the phone and seemed surprised that I could make it there despite the streets being closed down for festival. The first half of sandwich did have a black hair also, but thought it was an external hair. The second half there was another of these hairs and it was off to the trash for this disgusting sandwich. I have done decent on hair in food over years, but this experience tops all records. farewell to another lousy sandwich shop and watch out for Andrea who needs a hairnet for Christmas."}
{"text":"This isn't my usual Capriotti's location but I was driving by and decided to stop.  I ordered my usual turkey sandwich with extra pickles.  The guys working here were very friendly.  I recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love the turkey...it's like Thanksgiving any day of the week.  Awesome sandwiches and friendly employees.  Throw a tip in the jar and they yell out \"Beer Money\"  Quality ingredients so they are a little more expensive than other sub shops but worth the price."}
{"text":"Been to Capriotti's on Craig road maybe 8 times in a year, no problems.  Was glad when the Aliante locale opened so much closer to me.  Never a problem at Craig Road but been to Aliante twice, got the \"runs\" twice.   Sent them an email saying maybe they had a problem there and got a phone call \"educating\" me as to how this \"cannot be\". Don't know about you, but if I eat somewhere twice and get the runs both times, that's it, no more.  The (slightly) condescending nature of the response just adds to my decision to stick with Jersey Mikes and Firehouse from here on."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in Vegas period! Staff is always friendly. Ordering online is ok but I like to do it in the shop."}
{"text":"These sandwiches always blow my mind like good wine! My goodness....

Is it the soft buttery bread? 
The flavorful slaw?
The mouth watering pastrami?
Or that dressing that dances in your mouth? Which is it?

But it all together you have something called a capastrami...."}
{"text":"Capistami Sandwich all the way!  YUM!

There's also a elvis look alike that works here - very entertaining.

Kicked back atmosphere inside.  Local magazines to browse while you wait to take out or eat at their bar.  (no alcohol served here though)."}
{"text":"Second time here and I'm still not impressed. First time I found a big strand of hair in my sandwich. Ok they corrected it. I came back and phoned in an order and got the rudest reception \" Can't here you\", \" your phone is really bad\" and click hung up  on me. Fine call back and placed my order. Got same rude chick, better reception. Still it was \"what do want?\" Ok it'll be ready for you when you get here. Click and hung up again. No price, time frame or thank you. Picked up my order it was ready, didn't app check-in. Heavenly had problems checking me out and called the rude girl to help. I asked for my free cookie before I got the final total. The rude girl, just says \"no you should've given that before we rang you up\" and walks away and dismisses me with her hand. Heavenly didn't even give me the total and I still had the $$ in hand. Heavenly made up for it and gave me the cookie. Sandwich was good, but the service really sucks with that girl. Not sure if I'll be back here. I think I'll go to another location."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Great customer service!  He brought my sandwich and drink over to me at the salon as I had an appointment I didn't want to be late for.  My sandwich was piled with roasted turkey, lettuce, mayo, and a tomato.  I'll have to come back to try their subs."}
{"text":"I love Capriottis, but I don't love their service.

They say they offer delivery, but both times we tried getting it, we were denied. The first time we called, they said they stopped delivering an hour before close. We called about an hour and fifteen minutes before close. I get that that's cutting it close, but if they meant an hour and fifteen minutes, they should say so, and write it on their menu (which doesn't mention the \"hour rule.\") We ended up driving there and ordering. They didn't have any vegetarian turkey. ): 

The second time we tried calling, we called well before close, but they said they didn't have a delivery driver. Do they mean EVER? Is there only ONE person who can drive a car with sandwiches? What happens if their cook calls out--do they just shut the store down for the day?

Overall, I'm not impressed. Their sandwiches are good, but their service is terrible. They should just eliminate delivery entirely because it seems they already have..."}
{"text":"Man they make a good sandwich here. The Thanksgiving themed one is great as well as the pastrami. The bread is very tasty with the right amount of chew.

Its a small place, the kitchen /grill takes up most of it. I will say a lil pricey but its def higher quality the the super chains out there."}
{"text":"Absolute great service , when it comes to sandwiches they truly are one of the masters of genre"}
{"text":"My sandwich was so disgusting!  It's been over 2 years since I've been to Capriotti's so I was super excited to order the Bobbie again!  I remember coming here just for the Bobbie and the turkey was so fresh.  This time, our sandwiches tasted like they just pulled them out of the fridge, barely any cranberry sauce and I swear there were bones in the sandwich!  Now you know Capriotti's can be pricey.  Not what we expected from here and it pretty much ruined my taste for this place!  Never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"The reason you should go here (or any Capriotti) is because they have pulled turkey and roast beef, not sliced deli meat versions. It's like the old days, when people ate the food right out of the oven, instead of conforming it into a tube then slicing it thinly. Don't get me wrong, I love a good salami or ham, but not everything needs to be brined and cured, turkey being one of them. Yes, the bobby is amazing and you should get it, but I just branched out and got a pastrami, and it was good too."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and we ordered to go. From the moment I opened my sandwich I was disappointed. It really looked like it was just thrown together. It had very little lettuce, which was browning. And it was supposed to have onion. It did, but the amount is actually comical. See photo! I put mustard on it and it did taste okay. But I will not be back. I can make a better sandwich at home."}
{"text":"By far the best sub shop.  I haven't been to anyplace that had better tasting subs.  Just today I ordered a philly cheesteak with nothing but meat, cheese, and hot peppers and it was like an orgasm of the mouth.  The cheese was so melted into the spiced beef that it was almost like the beef was stirred in some sauce or something, hard to explain.  The peppers were hot which I loved.  I usually get the cold spicy Italian which is phenomenal as well, but today I tried something else.  Very happy with the service especially if you call it in ahead of time (no wait).  LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"Just ate the Town Square location in Las Vegas and am VERY unimpressed. Staff had everything put away at 6:45 pm (close at 8 pm) chairs were up on tables and took staff 25 mins to make sandwiches. After 25 mins, they told us the chicken noodle soup was \"bad\". Apparently they couldn't tell that earlier. Then they turned off the drink machine at 7:25 so we couldn't get refills. When we asked what time they closed they said 8. When we asked if we could get refills they said no because they were \"pre-closing\". This level of service shocked me and honestly I'm concerned about the food they prepared simply because of their lack of effort or interest in Service."}
{"text":"I am thoroughly impressed with this place, everytime I come here I get great service in the food is always amazing. They have not yet made a mistake they have gotten everything right. I am in love with the Bobby but I also really like the pastrami and cheese steak as well. I love to bread here, it has that crusty exterior and soft inside. They also have a great V.I.P. program that gives you lots of specials, discounts and even free sandwiches. You will not be missing out if you give them a try!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love captiottis! However, this location is appalling. The cashier did not remove her gloves while taking cash and cards, then used those same gloves as she was making sandwiches. Another customer asked her if she changed them and she said she did, however we all watched her not to do so. She was beyond rude and would not put on clean gloves. That is definitely a health code violation and embarrassing to the rest of the company. If you go to this location be sure you're checking their gloves and procedures."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!  I am not a fan of the \"bobbie\", i am not sure if i got a bad sandwich the one time i ordered this but i just didnt like it.  i DO, however, LOVE LOVE LOVE the \"cole turkey\" - tons of turkey, cheese, coleslaw and thousand island dressing.  i could eat one everyday.  the \"capistrami\" is also great, basically the same thing as above but with pastrami.  this place is hard to beat :)"}
{"text":"Loved it!!!! Great sandwiches, good service, We really like this place even though it's a bit out of the way and small. The food is good. My wife and I eat here at least once a week and have yet to be disappointed. I love the Cheese Steak with mushrooms and onion!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go especially on a lazy Sunday to grab food for a picnic! I can enjoy Thanksgiving dinner any time of the year thanks to the Bobbie! Even when I dine in I forget that the location is not the best. lol!"}
{"text":"The food was very good but the main reason for the 5 stars was the service. We arrived about 8 minutes after they closed on a Sunday Night. The door was unlocked because of a large catering order that was going out. They informed us that hey were closed but then offered to take our order anyway. We had planned on takeout anyway and were glad to minimize the disruption to them. They offered us drinks and even offered to take down the chairs if we wanted to sit while we waited. Again, few quick eat restaurants would rise to this level of service for someone arriving post close. Had a great cheesesteak too back at my hotel!"}
{"text":"The KIDS that work there need to follow directions and stop worrying about getting the sandwiches done and out of their hair ASAP. The customer in front of me asked for mayo on his sandwich and as he paid the KID behind the register said \"sorry we forgot your mayo\" and asked if he would like a cup of it to put on his sandwich himself, LOL. I ordered two large cheesesteaks and asked for mayo on them as well. When I went to pick them up I asked the young lady if they're sure they had mayo on them. She replies. \" Oh did you want mayo?\"
I replied \" Yes, I asked for it and so did the customer ahead of me that you also forgot about as well. Then she had a blank stare on her face. I then grabbed my sandwiches from the counter and walked out. I won't be returning to this location. They need someone there managing."}
{"text":"Good same captioning taste but sometimes they run out of sub bread on Friday & Saturdays close to closing time. That just means they're awesome! Love having one around the corner."}
{"text":"Since my last review each time my boyfriend and I have been in the service and food has been fantastic. The people who work there are very friendly and helpful, and in general funny people. Especially Alex, who seems to genuinely care for his job and us as customers. Also my boyfriend is not allowed on my phone anymore for editing reviews in terrible ways."}
{"text":"Went with the Steak Cheese sandwich and wife went with the Chicken philly sandwich They were ok, but nothing to right home about.
That being said its much better than Subway or Jimmy Johns!"}
{"text":"Literally best sandwiches EVER! I am from the East Coast and there are none of these sandwiches shops near me. I'm visiting for the week and have already been twice!"}
{"text":"This place is in the food court at the Green Valley Ranch Casino. They open at 8am. The gentleman that waited on me was very nice and talkative. 
I got the famous BOBBY small. with a drink. He brought it out to my table. Loved it
One thing is I wish they would warm the sandwich before serving it. I have been to some Capriotti's that do that and it makes the sandwich taste even more amazing."}
{"text":"What else is new. Only this app never accepts my CC. Never an issue with Panera or jimmy johns app. I'm over trying to over from any caps shop. Not easy or convenient and I'm told it's my fault when I call."}
{"text":"The day staff there is amazing. Very friendly, remind you of all your choices without being pushy / obnoxious. They definitely stuff more meat in the sandwiches during the day too. I had a new cashier being trained and for his first day on the job, excellent service and zero mistakes. 
Make sure you join the caps club and do the surveys - free food for so many visits and other bonuses!!!
PS - if you want a sammich at night, go to red rock casino. Way better staff and they actually fill your sammich up!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing to say that the crew working here right now have been disrespectful, inconsiderate, and just plain out right rude a young lady by the name kourtney was so busy flirting around with her boyfriend Damon that she didn't realize I was trying to  finish my order. I ended up leaving with nothing"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and tried the Bobbie which is their best seller. Quite different from anything I've ever tried. If you love turkey, cranberries and dressing, try it! Took the pizza crepe home for my husband. I'll post that review later!"}
{"text":"Meatball sub was raw!  Notified the store, customer service was very unhelpful!  We will never order from this location again."}
{"text":"I know being a local its practically a sin to say I don't like Capriottis but thats how I feel especially after eating here about a million times.

These are the reasons why: too much bread for the sandwiches, gross selection of chips, expensive for a sub, cheap deli meats and only pre-shredded iceberg lettuce available no mixed greens or spinach. Also the stuffing for the turkey sandwich, with cranberry sauce, is either bland or alternates with being really salty and dry/crumbly."}
{"text":"This yelp will be honest and accurate. I ordered a meatball sub, the young dark haired girl asked if I wanted cheese, I said yes and she totaled me out. 7pm on a Tuesday night,  is this a bad time?  No mention of a drink or chips, I asked for a cookie but did not get one. I won't say anything bad about the sandwich but I did not care for the experience. I did take something  with me, the knowledge of why I go to Subway. Good evening."}
{"text":"I go here every chance I get! Usually eat the Italian sausage sandwich, loaded and it never fails to satisfy like those sandwiches I had yesteryear growing up in Iowa(Raymond's in Clear Lake). Give it a shot, they have a large menu and fast service!"}
{"text":"So I was craving a turkey sandwich with all the fixin's and I searched around for a place that would serve up a Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich even though it was not that time of year. Desperate to satisfy my craving I stumble across this restaurant and by luck it was only a few mins down the road from me. SCORE!

So I get there and there is no need to even look at the menu. I know what I'm there for...the Bobbie. I see signs around saying how it's been voted the best sandwich around and so now I'm desperate to try this amazing sandwich. 

I get my order to go and when I get home. I unwrap the sandwich like a kid unwrapping his first present on his birthday. With so much excitement and glee. I swear my eyes are twinkling at this point. 

I look at it. It's a mess. Cranberry, Turkey, and stuffing piled on to the max...I bust out my camera and take my yelp photo then open my mouth as big as it opens and sink my teeth into....disappointment. 

The turkey was nothing special. No flavors. The cranberries were over powering and the stuffing....that was the worst part. Didn't know you could actually ever make stuffing taste bad. Now I know you can. It lacked the flavor and the texture I was looking for. 

This sandwich has so much potential and the whole idea of it is amazing. But my sandwich tasted like airplane food. I deserve better GD!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but the business owner has absolutely no business sense. I am guessing this place goes under in 6 months. Why would you put this store within 500 feet of several more established places like firehouse, Panera, Jersey Mikes, there are others as well. Decent subs, horrible location. Dumb dumb dumb"}
{"text":"spotty hours, food is incredible but I really do not understand how they can run out of bread. Kind of like going to McDonalds and not being able to order a burger."}
{"text":"This place is just meh.  The seating area felt very weird, almost like they hadn't finished the place.  I got the Bobbie, but it was cold!  I guess it was my fault for reading that it would not be a hot sammie, but seriously, turkey and stuffing should be warm!  My boyfriend got the sandwich with the cole slaw and provolone, and that was actually good.  I thought it would be great given the reviews, but it was just OK.  I probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"This is the newest location. I ordered a 9\" cheesesteak with fried (grilled) onions, mayo and lettuce. It was \"okay\" the steak was plentiful but not seasoned. It was also pretty dry maybe over cooked?? The online ordering system doesn't show you that it doesn't work unit you try to check out so had to physically go to the location after calling in the order."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this location. It was Very clean when walked in and smelled great. The staff acknowledged us immediately. We ordered The BOBBIE!! It was so delicious. We will be back it only takes us 10-15min on the freeway to get here. Well worth it."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Hyatt across the street and I must've had 4 of those sandwiches in a week. I had the thanksgiving one (freaking great) and the pastrami deliciousness. 

Capriottis is a great cheap Vegas eat. Def recommend."}
{"text":"I go here a lot. Staff is always friendly. Food is always correct and prepared fast.. not sure why others are complaining. Maybe they've had a bad experience but I haven't had one since I've been going to the place.. Great food!"}
{"text":"I always get the homemade turkey sandwich with peppers.  Peppers are the business!  The peppers make your mouth burns a lil but then again I don't handle spiciness well."}
{"text":"Almost always a great sub. Today they put a little too much pepper on my cheese steak but it was still edible & tasty. Usually a short wait & good service"}
{"text":"Capriottis isn't a solid sandwich spot! The subs go for 3 sizes: small, large, and even larger! (Idk the third size's name but it's huge!) and the subs are loaded! I love getting the capistrami and the bobbie, both subs are excellent and with lots of flavor. The great part about this location is that it's right across the street from UNLV and is open 24 hours, so you have late night cravings, Capriottis is here for you! I just wish there were even more options for the sandwiches"}
{"text":"Capriotti's is my jam! I've been to all the Vegas and Los Angeles locations. I highly recommend the Capistrami or the Bobbie."}
{"text":"My friend loves the turkey. I had a decent salad here. The customer service is ok, not great, not awful. I have come to expect more-maybe that's just me though."}
{"text":"I have been there 4 times in a month and they are awesome
Always friendly and greet you by name 
They even listen to special request like no stuffing and they did it 
We said light mayo and that is what they got
To the other reviewer go to a salad bar"}
{"text":"Horrible service employees don't care. Give you wrong sandwiches. Get the old people back that ran it. These new people suck. And the roast beef was dry sitting on a tray all day.funny how all the  good reviews were before the new crew. Wake up!!!!! You new people suck"}
{"text":"When we lived in Vegas we use to go to Capriottis all the time. My husband loved the Bobbi and loved the Homemade Turkey. They are excellent sandwiches! I wish they had one in Salt Lake City, Utah."}
{"text":"OMG! The best sandwich I have ever had ! The turkey,cheese lettuce and mayo melted in my mouth! Pulled turkey fresh every morning! I will definitely come back whenever I'm in Scottsdale !I love this place !"}
{"text":"small space, good service, ok sandwich..turkey was a little dry for my taste and no dijon mustard ...I prefer Togos."}
{"text":"Just average cheese steak; but, I did have an adequate turkey sandwich the second time around.  It was, just a bit small for the price!  I'm basically done with this restaurant.  Too many other options available for the price."}
{"text":"I normally don't review chains but The Bobbie was so damn good I had to chime in.  I can't speak on the building or parking or service as this was picked up by someone else.  

What I can speak on is how amazing this sub was.  The bread was fresh and soft and a bit chewy.  The ingredients went perfectly together.  Shredded turkey, covered in cranberry sauce, with lots of stuffing on top.  The stuffing was seasoned perfectly and moist.  They also put some mayo on it and it just brought everything together in harmony.

I ordered the 12\" for 10 bucks.  It was worth every penny.  I would eat this sub once a month with no problem.  Highly recommend trying it."}
{"text":"6pm on a Saturday night of a 3 day weekend.   Sprinkler is broken so you get wet coming in the front door.  3 of the sodas are empty and they have no straws. I hope the soup and salad are good. Almost went to the store in the casino. Might have been a better choice tonight."}
{"text":"Went to this shop on Charleston and Torrey pines . It really is a great shop
I love
Comming here for lunch . But one day they did a few simple mistakes on my order and when I called back for them to replace the mistake I went threw a hassle . I did not have the receipt but I do have the credit card I purchased the sandwich with .. I could have got a bank statement . I only went there 2 days prior they could of went back on orders or check the cameras . Anyways the manager at the store named josh or so
Thing like that basically laughed over the phone because my boyfriend was upset that he was not trying to help us at all . And said \" it's just a sandwich shop bro \" . I felt really disrespected and he didn't want to give us his district managers number which her name is Kat. After contacting Kat at another location she helped me very fast and I do appreciate it but idk if I will be going back .."}
{"text":"New owners? Lazy staff? I love Capriotti's cheesesteaks, I order them for the fam on nights we don't have time to cook. The last three times I've ordered through Postmates the order has been cancelled because the merchant is \"too busy\". The last time this happened my husband drove to the shop and not only were they not busy, they were rude, and messed up our order. 

As a former restaurant owner, and especially in this neighborhood, you should be saying yes to all the business... how long does it take to make a sandwich? Even if it's delayed, there's really no excuse for it to be cancelled, over and over again. After yet another cancelled order, I had Postmates go to a Capriotti's on Sunset and guess what? They were able to complete my order. 

Get your act together, or you'll be another east side business gone by the wayside."}
{"text":"9/3/13 Capriotti's delivered subs to my place of work.  I found the shredded pork and coleslaw sub bland and dry, but the turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sub was tasty.  It was Thanksgiving dinner between two pieces of bread!  :-)"}
{"text":"Iv  been to all of them, and they are pretty much the same... bomb but being open 24/7 gets 10/5 stars! And service has always been good!"}
{"text":"3 people. Barely working. One of them just waiting to take orders. I asked questuons but was just stared at. Ordered a large and medium. Found out my 2 sandwiches were $35. She couldn't change my order. Was too difficult for her. Then she said it would be 35 minutes before it was ready. They literally make one sandwich at a time. Place is almost empty. I am shocked and appalled."}
{"text":"Didn't even get to eat here. I wanted to try this place for the first time since I heard the sandwiches were so good. I walked in and looked at the menu as the guy in front of me gave his order and as soon as he finished paying, the man behind the register casually walked around the counter right passed me, out the door, got in his car and left. He didn't say anything... just left. As I stood there for a minute, the 2 guys making a sandwiches just quickly glanced at me and said nothing.  So I casually turned around and left. Who needs to try the food with customer service as ridiculous as that."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's a bit bigger than most of the other capriottis I've been do so I like that. 

The sandwiches are always solid and the veggie cold turkey is the bees knees. 

If you're in the are and want to grab a quick bite or heading home and want an easy dinner fix. These guys here will hook it up. 

Did I mention the kettle chip selection is stellar."}
{"text":"Crazy good sandwiches. The Capastrami is amazing!!! Split the 20inch for 2 people! It's more than enough food!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients! Huge portions!! A small sub is 9 inches! The only reason they don't get 5 stars is they lack variety on the menu as well as the toppings that can be added. I will definitely be back though!"}
{"text":"Had the meatball sandwich the other night, ordered to-go.  Very good sandwich, 
sauce and meatballs had a very good flavor.  Very nice people working in the shop.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I am still waiting to see this place of the food network or travel channel on one of them shows. I don't understand why they haven't made it yet?!?! Because the CAPISTRAMI has to be one of the best pastrami sandwiches in the world. No it's not your Italian deli pastrami but I'm not Italian so I don't care. It's dam good! And the BOBBIE! OMG the BOBBIE will smack you in the face. Imagine a turkey dinner with all the fixin's in a sandwich. And the turkey is fresh. It's not your deli sliced turkey. This is chunks of real turkey which you will never find at any other sandwich shop. This makes me sad that I haven't eating meat. So yesterday I tried the VEGGIE CHEESESTEAK! It tastes just like the real thing. It's some soy meat stuff but it's pretty good. Kinda chewy. But I'm giving it 5 stars because the CAPISTRAMI AND BOBBIE are two of the most original and tastiest sandwiches ever. And this is the only place you can order cranberry with your sandwich in Vegas. At least from the places I've been."}
{"text":"I'm basically a chain-hater (well, I dont hate them, but I try to avoid them).
Capriottis is an exception.
This delicious sandwich shop has some of the best sandwiches I've  had for the type of establishment that it is: a chain sandwich shop.
The Bobbie, which is made of freshly roasted turkey (I've seen the big hunks that didn't get chopped), cranberry sauce, stuffing and a hint of mayo is fabulous!
The capastrami is a delightful combination of hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and cole slaw, and wonderful in taste.
You can choose the size of sandwich you want, as well!
Capriotti's also has salads, and a host of other sandwhich selections, which are consistently delicious and fresh.
Their personnel are very friendly, the prices are very reasonable, and it can be the best quick sandwich you've ever had...you just have to go!"}
{"text":"This is what a sandwich shop should be.  As noted by others, their turkey rocks.  It's actual roasted / pulled turkey meat & not the Oscar Meyer (sorry not a fan) lunchmeat you find at Subway.  Don't even think about getting anything larger than a medium - trust me I've tried & failed.   Attentive staff + fresh & delicious ingredients, = a great sandwich - watch out Cousin's, Milios, Subway, etc...there's a new kid in town & they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Seriously I love Capriotti's sandwiches. I've been coming to this place a few times. But it seems as though they do not even care about hygiene. When you walk into their store you can see their kitchen. I do not know what it is but I have no idea why they would let their kitchen door open. IT IS FILTHY!!!!!!
The floor grossed me out it looks like it hasn't swept and mopped for days. As soon as I noticed the kitchen being dirty, I immediately checked what grade they got from the SNHD. And of course they got an A. Haha not even funny..I am sorry I love your sandwhiches but I won't be coming back. It just grosses me out whenever I think about Capriotti's."}
{"text":"This place still sucks. Husband picked up some subs for us here 'cause he had a craving for it. We got hairs in both our subs. This place is disgusting."}
{"text":"So good we got an extra sandwich to go.

My fiancé could live on sandwiches for the rest of his life and be a happy well fed fella. He's always on the look out for a new place and today he suggested Capriotti's with a certain eagerness in his eye.

Located next to the Golden Steer just off the strip (yet in a non-run down area) with plenty of parking. Capriotti's is a smallish restaurant with about 10  - 12 tables (depending on the arrangement). Since you can eat a sandwich fairly quickly or take it home, it's not really an issue. Plenty of seats were to be found when we were there.

I ordered the Italian Meatball and he ordered the Turkey sandwich. Like most couples we took a bit of each other's sandwich. While not a big turkey fan, I have to say it was really put together well. REAL turkey with chucks of meat and not the pressed deli meat you'll find in a sandwich vending machine. With plenty of condiments mixed with a nice mixture of spices made for great turkey sandwich.

I ordered the Meatball and consider it one of the best I've ever eaten. The  bread was soft enough to allow the cheese and tomato sauce to mix together so you get that delicious tomato, meat, cheese, bread paste in your mouth. 

Many places will serve it to you with a hard shell of a sandwich leaving you with a soggy inside and a impenetrable crust capable of chipping a tooth. Luckily you won't find such a monstrosity here.

The staff was very friendly and didn't blink an eye when we asked for condiments. They even suggested some options they thought would go create with the sandwich.

At the end, we enjoyed our individual sandwiches so much we ordered the famous \"Bobbi\" to go for dinner that night. Despite being 6 hours old and sitting in a car for a while, it was still very tasty. I only imagine how much better it tastes fresh or after taking it home.

If dollar value matters, rest assured the prices are fair and the smallest sandwich is 9 inches long which should satisfy anyone. 

So if you love sandwiches, go to Capriotti's for a great deal and probably the best sandwich you've had in a long time."}
{"text":"So delicious! Not to pricey for the portion they serve. Hot and cold sandwiches are served and the portions they serve are pretty big and they aren't greedy with the meet... my favorite will have to be the pastrami! It's so delish!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Capriotti's.  My normally one-hour meeting lasted two and a half hours, past my normal lunch time, so I was looking for food - fast.  Jimmy John's, as it turns out, does not deliver to our office building, but Google told me about Capriotti's.  After reading some other Yelp reviews, I opted to order online, but pick up in store.  

I ordered my favorite sandwich (anywhere) - an Italian sub.  Ordering online was easy; I had the option to customize my sandwich and pay online or pay in-store.  My sandwich was ready and warm when I arrived (a few minutes after the \"ready by\" time), there was no line, and I was in and out in no time (around 1:00 p.m. on a weekday).  

Now, the sandwich.  It was savory, flavorful, and, in short, absofreakin delicious.  It smelled wonderful, and I had to take at least one taste before returning to the office to finish devouring it.  I exclaimed with glee after the first bite, and was glad that I got the foot long.  It reminded me of an amped up Potbelly sub - but with thicker, tastier cuts of meat, and softer (yet less flaky and messy) bread.  $9 for a foot long of that caliber sandwich is a steal in my mind.  Jimmy John's, Potbelly, and Subway are a thing of the past now. :-)

To address some of the other themes in reviews:  
1. Accuracy:  100%.  I asked for no grilled onions, no pepper, and to add mayo.  
2. Friendliness:  I was only picking up (and came in the back door), so there wasn't a party when I arrived, but the cashier smiled and was friendly enough.
3. Timeliness:  My order was ready when I arrived, and I was in and out of the establishment within 2 minutes tops."}
{"text":"This is the only chain in town that allows you to get a cheesesteak quickly. The staff is meh, but this place hits the spot where you need a sub that isn't microwaved or just toasted. There aren't a ton of great options in the area for quality subs, so this place is the \"to-go\" place when you need some greasy decadence. You can order online through an app which offers discount and allows you to track your sub purchases. if you order enough times, you get a free 9-inch sub."}
{"text":"My review is based on the service I received. I ordered a sandwich right away from the cook without looking at the menu. I was asked if I wanted mushrooms on it. I said yes. I was then walked through my options. When I got to the counter to pay, I was informed that the mushrooms would cost extra. I expressed that I would have liked to have been told they cost more before ordering them. I was laughed at by the cook, who said I should have read the board better (I hadn't glanced at it). It was too late to change my order, so I let it pass. Well, the cost did come out of the tip.

Good businesses and staff are respectful to their customers. That's what keeps them coming back. In the grand scheme of things, one dollar isn't a big deal. However, failing to treat your customers with respect and treating them right means that you're less likely to get repeat business."}
{"text":"This place has gone down every time I've visited. Don't go to this location....Capriotti's is a good sandwich shop but there are lots of issues with this particular location. Today, I came in and there are no straws or company bags. They said they are out of both. I get a Terrible Hearst gas station bag and one of the employee's family members works there they told me & were hooked up...Then I order a Slaw Be Jo sandwich. I bring the sandwich home and the sandwich tastes poor and the meet is chunky instead of shredded plus the meat isn't what is supposed to be. When I drive back to the store the employee says she didn't make my sandwich and that is how they have been making the sandwiches recently...why would you deviate from what the store has on the menu. Another issue is the staff. There is always a new person working there. A couple of times I saw the employees smoking out in the front of the store visible to everyone who enters. Sometimes I can smell the smoke when I'm placing my order. Also, their appearance/attire isn't up to standards based on other stores Ive been to over a 7 year span. This will be the last time going to this particular store and I would rather drive the extra 10 minutes to go to the Blue Diamond and Decatur store that is a more traditional Capriotti's run store."}
{"text":"Yelped and found this place because it was fairly close to our hotel. My boyfriend and I ordered two Capriotti's specials: Capastrami and SlawBeJoe. Both were pretty much the same except for the selection in meat, Capastrami had pastrami and SlawBeJoe had roast beef. Even though that was the case, we enjoyed SlawBeJoe more. The meat just tasted a lot more tender and yummy. The cole slaw and Russian dressing was delicious though, and it gave the sandwiches a good finish.

There was a line of people ordering in there which correctly reflected the quality of their sandwiches. This is a more intimate sandwich shop, there are only ~10-15 tables max in there so avoid bringing too huge of a group!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. No attention to customers. Walked out.  Asked for owners phone number. Denied. Store needs help. Quickly."}
{"text":"I had the Bobby (thanksgiving sandwich!) and my BF had the Capistrami and they were both amazing. Service was great. We're from LA and this was one of the best sandwich experiences we've had in a while!"}
{"text":"The food is always on point. I really really like the Bobbie and capastrami. I had my food stolen twice because they did not ask my name or I would give five stars. Clean and friendly but not the fastest service."}
{"text":"I eat here about 2 times a week, I love the cheese steak and the capristromi. The service is amazaing and ALWAYS super friendly!!! Not just at this location but at the one on Rainbow as well. The price seems a bit hit, untill you actually eat there then the price is worth it. Careful on the size you order, the large subs are almost the size of baseball bats :)"}
{"text":"Dirty and dingy
Guy at the counter must sleep in the street
We both have stomach aches
Ate half my soup
Hubby could not eat sandwich
Threw it away
Our fault
We hesitated
The whole place was a turnoff
Never go back"}
{"text":"When I move from one neighborhood to another in Vegas, one of the first things I do is find my new neighborhood Capriotti's. This location serves the Mountain's Edge area (SW) side and by and large I've always experienced good service here.

Full disclosure: I have never, ever dined in at this location, nor any other Capriotti's. I rarely order at the counter either. I've found the easiest way to avoid waiting is to call in my order about 10 minutes before I get there.

My standard orders are, in no particular order: the Cheesesteak, the Chicken Cheesesteak, the Bobbie, the Capastrami, the Slaw-Be-Jo and their turkey sandwich with everything. Toppings and bread are always fresh, although the amount/ratio of toppings seems to vary from visit to visit. Love the Utz chips. Wish this location sold the large size bags of the Jalapeno ones again, though!

Friendly Tip: When you get a receipt that has the random survey code (not all receipts will have this), fill out the survey. It takes, like, 5 minutes and you get $3 off your next order. For a small or medium sandwich, that $3 represents a HUGE savings."}
{"text":"Wow! Great sandwiches! Loved the Cheesesteak & the \"Thanksgiving on a roll\" turkey sandwich. Nice loyalty program, too! will be looking for more locations as I travel."}
{"text":"My wife had the turkey sandwich and it was way too dry. My Dad had the turkey cranberry and there were bones in it. I had the meatball and it was actually pretty good."}
{"text":"How long have I lived in Las Vegas (6 years) and this is the first time I've tried Capriotti's!  My husband couldn't believe it!

We rolled up here for a early dinner one night.  When I was looking for the menu, I had no idea what I wanted.  Luckily, there wasn't anyone in line after me and the guy taking orders was super patient.  I asked about their Cole Turkey, which had russian dressing and coleslaw on it, but no one that worked there ever had it, so I took that as an answer of not to order it, haha!

So I ordered:
*Homemade Turkey
comes w/ provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion, seasonings.  I had all that and included pickles, mayo and mustard.

The turkey had wonderful flavor.  However, I didn't like how dense the bread was.  I actually tore off a lot of the bread as there was just too much.

*Hot Chicken Cheesesteak
-no mushrooms.  My husband said he craves this!

Overall, not bad and a nice change from Subway or Jersey Mike's."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning here last week. The shop was so incredibly dirty when I walked in and looked behind the counter at the food prep stations, as well as one of the cooks sneezing ever 5 seconds. They also messed up my order and had to redo it. Should have known not to eat it. Will not be back. Heath district should be called honestly"}
{"text":"These are the best sandwiches in the whole western USA. Their creations are not only creative but extremely tasty"}
{"text":"Capastrami review: warm soft roll, tender hot pastrami, saucy Cole slaw, and some sauce that must have crack in it because every visit I order the same exact 20\" Capastrami sandwich to share with the family and it disappears in 5 minutes flat. 
Staff is always very friendly and efficient. Thanks for the fix."}
{"text":"I called in an order and was told to come 15 minutes after the call. I showed up 25 minutes later with 2 other people waiting on their orders. My receipt number 20022. There was over 5 people working and standing there. The cashier looked around and said they were still working on it. She started working on my 2 sandwiches and I was told it was going to be another 10-15 minutes. At checkout I was given someone else's order. The lady apologized and said that order was an online order and she placed the sandwiches back on the bag after I had handled them. It took a few more minutes for them to get situated and then I was given my order."}
{"text":"I tried...  tonight was the 4th time I've been to this location.  The first 3 were relatively close to when they opened.  Twice my order was incorrect (to go orders), and the third time was a 25 minutes wait to go.  Decided to give it another try tonight...  mistake.  I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich to go with the regular toppings.  This time it came out in an acceptable time.  I got home, and the sandwich was completely dry.  Meat, cheese, tomatoes, and a ton of lettuce.  That's it.  Thank goodness the Azure location is just a few miles away.  I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"This place has a bomb turkey sandwich.  Comes complete with cranberry sauce.  

I wouldn't recommend the Philly cheesesteak.  It was average.  

Good service and they had all the college games on."}
{"text":"And the Bobbie was created.  And God saw that it was good.  And God blessed the Bobbie.  

For those of us too isolated from family, too tired to attempt a full turkey, and too poor to afford all that meat, a higher power reached down from the heavens and created Capriottis' \"the Bobbie\". The Bobbie is a massive sub composed of freshly carved turkey, stuffing, mayo, and cranberry sauce.  Those in a spiritual crisis might just find the answer to all questions of religion and higher beings in the simple fact that the Bobbie exists.  To paraphrase Ben Franklin, \"[the Bobbie] is proof that God loves us\". 

Since discovering the restaurant last month, I've had three."}
{"text":"Who ever works day shift apparently needs to be micromanaged. How do you run out of something that takes an hour to make when you still have to be open for three more hours??? Seems to be on ongoing problem with all of these sandwich shops. Try hiring people that actually do their job"}
{"text":"Just tried Capriottis, i was very impressed, great sandwich, i got the Pastrami signature sandwich they have. Tasty, Great bread...i'll be back for sure! bit pricey but hey, everywhere is now"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving sandwich, AKA the Bobbie, is amazing: turkey day leftovers on a bun, taste totally hits the spot even when the holiday is months off. 

Service is quick and friendly, sandwich is made where you can see it. They seem to thrive in the location due to the nearby college. Add in that their sandwiches are well-priced: the small clocks in at just under $7.50.

Criticisms: 
This location closes at 8PM, which makes sense if their only business is the college crowd but living nearby, I can't go nearly as often as I would if they were open a bit later.
Chain's sandwiches start at a small, clocking in at 9\". For the Bobbie, that's nearly 1000 calories, total overkill. Wish they had a size smaller than small, like a half-size called a mini. I only eat half at a time, anyway."}
{"text":"Capriottis  is usually good, but when have a staff as poorly trained as this one. You get unhappy customers."}
{"text":"I was that annoying customer asking a bunch of questions and unable to make up my mind.  The guy was patient and answered all of my questions with a smile.  I had to wait several minutes for the two sandwiches, but, hey, quality take time, right? 

The manager (I think) came out of the back, happy, jolly, and singing to the radio.  It was great; good energy.  People engaged in their work and have fun doing it are more engaging and enjoyable to be around.  

When my sandwiches were almost done, Mr. Happy Manager rang up my order and gave me my total.  It seemed a little high.  When I questioned the amount, I found out they were making three sandwiches instead of two.  Yep, that was my fault for making the order-taking process so confusing.  I apologized and tipped a few bucks on my take-out order.  They didn't seem annoyed or flustered at all.   Cool points for good customer service.  Plenty of other places would have made a big deal.

As far as the sandwiches go, fantastic!  Soft, delicious bread.  Sweet and hot peppers that make the sandwich.  The most vegetarian options I have ever seen for a cheese steak sandwich shop, and quite impressively tasty at that!  Veg heads and meat lovers alike will both crave the goodness of a Capriotti's sandwich!  No longer does one person have to \"sacrifice\" for the other's meal.

The small sub is more than enough for one person.  If you are looking to split a sandwich, or have leftovers, go ahead and get a large.  Then again, I guess if you normally eat extremely enormous portions, a medium or large would probably work.

Trust me, just go here when you are in the mood for a good, hearty sandwich.  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I can assure you that I was pretty much the biggest pain in the ass customer in the history of this place.  Mainly because they put coleslaw on their sandwiches, and I really detest coleslaw.  But when I found out just how prohibitive that was, I relented and ordered the capastrami (i think) which was pastrami, swiss, russian dressing, and coleslaw.

And much to my surprise, it was actually really damn good.  Please note: this is the first time in about 25 years that I've voluntarily eaten coleslaw.  But it worked with the sandwich, and worked well.

They have a sandwich on the menu, the bobbie, that is turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and one other thing and they claim that that is a really great sandwich.  Perhaps next time... although I might have a hard time forgoing the capastrami."}
{"text":"I was greeted by two of these young men as I entered the restaurant. The vibe in here was upbeat and happy. I couldn't believe it. When staff is happy and all enjoying working g together...it really shows. 
My sandwich was made exactly the way I ordered it :)"}
{"text":"If you go in, get the BOBBIE. Major props to Mick who made our sandwich. The guy is a wealth of information about hiking through California and totally took the time to point out some must sees on our drive up through Yosemite.  Take the time to talk with him, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"They make some good of the best sandwiches I have had. 

I would stay away from the homemade turkey sandwich on wheat as that was the only sandwich I had there I was not satisfied with.

I usually get the Capistrami with extra hot peppers or the cheesesteak with extra hot and onions. 

Always get good friendly service and I call in my order for pickup most of the time."}
{"text":"You forgot my onions guy what's going on the onions are not on my sandwich. It's so sad no onions my cheese steak is not the same does not even tast good into the trash it went"}
{"text":"I thought of trying this place on my way to work. I wasn't sure if they had any vegetarian options, and I was pleasantly surprised to see a vegetarian friendly menu. 

I ordered a medium size veggie turkey sandwich and it was huuuuge!!! I had half for lunch and saved the other half for dinner. The sandwich was very tasty, I loved everything in it - the veggies, specially sweet peppers and pickles, mock turkey and thin slices of cheese...perfect for me!

Two days later, I was there again and ordered the vegetarian cheese steak sandwich, this time a small size :)  It was still 9'' though! I loved this sandwich too! It's a hot sub with mock steak fried with veggies of your choice. Seriously, I love sweet peppers the most!!!

I am always on a lookout for places offering mock meats and hardly knew of much options before - Green and Cornish Pasty are ones I like! I was overjoyed to see this place sitting so close to my work place. Great place for quick lunches/dinners and prices are not super cheap but affordable. The best part - their soy meats ACTUALLY taste good! I have been to numerous mock-meat places, and the meats are tasteless, bland and so disappointing. But Capriotti's is different. 

I am going to try the veggie cheeseburger and veggie cole turkey sandwich next. Cant wait! :D"}
{"text":"Awesome food with a very friendly staff--always great moods! Nice place for lunch and an easy to choose menu--highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's has screwed up my orders multiple times. I left a tip here a long time ago that said \"Count the number of items in your bag before you leave\" and this is a more useful tip than you know. I've run into this issue MULTIPLE times. Not just getting the wrong order but getting less subs than what I paid for. Suck. 
Love the food. The novelty wears off after a while. Chicken cheesesteaks are my personal fave. 
Oh, and parking is terrible in this tiny little lot. If you are able to park here, you'll likely have a difficult time getting in and out!"}
{"text":"Not sure why all the negative reviews, maybe revisit it again. Great service and with a smile. Both gentlemen were very polite. Fast take out service. Clean restaurant area and the philly chicken was delicious"}
{"text":"I will never know how great the sandwich is cause I arrived on Friday at noon only to discover a line of 10 ahead of me, many tables taken with others waiting for ordered sandwiches, one cashier busy taking phone orders and one cook. How can a place open with only two employees.?? Figured I would be waiting for 2-3 hours so I left. Went to Croque sandwich shop, in and out in 5 minutes, they had 5 employees present, and had ,IMHO the best Tuna Sandwich in the world."}
{"text":"Sunday evening around 5 pm. 11/12/2017
This location gives Cappriotti's a very BAD name.
It is the filthiest,dirtiest place I have seen.The employees were too busy talking to each other to clean.I saw filth, old food,every where.The prep tables had food and filth all over them,there were weeks worth of food under the prep tables,the employees were dirty.There was old food all over there grills....
I will never return to this crap hole.Expect a visit from the health department soon.
It is not fair to take paying customers health into your own hands.That's how disease spreads.
Every cold prep table was wide open and you could visibly tell food was not being held at correct temperatures.I spoke with the \"Manager\" and she said they were just about to clean it\"
Disgusting."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches what can I say. A bit pricey but its worth it bc of the great quality of ingredients - my bread never gets soggy! Love that the turkey is cooked and shredded in house - if you haven't tried it, my fave is the \"Cole Turkey\" or the \"Bobbie\". I always get the 20'' large to get the best bang for my buck and ask them to cut it into 4 pieces to share (or save it for myself later!)

The staff at all locations are pretty friendly and are always open to any customizations you have for your sandwich. If you have a more than 1 sandwich, call ahead to significantly decrease wait time."}
{"text":"Won't be back again. I ordered a turkey sandwich which is pretty much all bread. Speaking of bread, I wasn't even given an option for type of bread I wanted. NOT the Greatest sandwich in America as they suggest. I'll hit up Subway before I come back here again. Not even really worth 1 star!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered over the phone at 11:27 am was told 20 minutes. I arrived to find that my order was not ready and they had nothing cooking on the grill. The black female employee told me 5 more minutes. I paid for my order and asked the cashier if the owner was in. I was told he could give me the number if I really wanted it. I figured it wouldn't make a difference anyway so I said forget it. Now the black female is giving me dirty look and rolling her eyes. My order is now ready 35 minutes later the guy hands it to me and says is this paid for? I say of course it is and  walk out and get in my SUV. Seconds later I have him banging on my window. Before I can get the window down he is standing behind my car taking a picture of my plates. I get out and ask what the hell are you doing!!!! He tells me I did not pay for my food. I walk back in and yell at the dumbass kid behind the counter and say D0 you not remember me??? He looks back at the cash tapes and says oh that my mistake he did pay. The place is ran by uneducated low rent employees. If the owner reads this have enough nerve to address me and the issue."}
{"text":"I've definitely heard a lot about this place from other people and decided to finally give it a shot for the first time in over a year of living in Las Vegas.

Upon going inside, I noticed it's a little bit cozy in there and you kind of have to wiggle your way around to the cashier. But it didn't really matter; my order came out quickly.

I only got the Bobbie (like others have mentioned, it's basically Thanksgiving ingredients in a sub). I liked it overall -- I felt like there was a touch too much stuffing, though. But I'm not really a stuffing kind of person initially, so that might be why. I LOVED the cranberries in there; just the right amount of sweetness to offset the turkey and stuffing.

I might drop by here again to try to Capristrami sometime. :-)"}
{"text":"5 customers, 7 capriotti employees behind the counter and 25 minutes of waiting to get 2 Cole Turkey sandwiches. This place should be a case study in how not to run a sandwich shop. We witnessed one couple wait almost 30 minutes to get a hot sandwich while one employee was unpacking rubber gloves and the manager was counting soda bottles. This place is unbelievable. Our coles were not up to usual Capriotti excellent standards either."}
{"text":"OmG! the Mecca of sandwiches I'm from Seattle and recently i came to Vegas for a visit and i was super hungry and i saw Capriottis my immediate reaction was \"meh just some sandwich shop\" do not let that stop you people! This shop has some of the best cheese steak and other sandwiches i wish Capriottis would open a shop here in Seattle!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at Capriotti's in my old neighborhood many times and they were always great.  This new one near my house not so much.  I sat and waited forever to get my simple medium chicken cheese steak and 20 min later still no sandwich.  When I asked where it was nobody knew anything.  The \"team\" here doesn't communicate very well.  They are in some need of some proper management as everyone seems a bit confused.  After finally getting my $12 sub I was hoping the quality of product would make up for the service.  Nope.  The sub I got was so soggy the bread fell apart trying to eat it.  What happened to the bread being crisped up a bit and maybe draining some grease out of the meat?  A soggy gross mixture with way too much cheese.  Shoot.  Was hoping for another  good restaurant option near me but I won't be going to this Capriottis again."}
{"text":"The Bobbie was great but....very slow very expensive and the LOUD hip hop music at lunchtime made it hard to talk....."}
{"text":"Capistrami and the Bobbie....quite possibly the best sandwhiches I have had in my life....outside of Little Saigon of course


no need to say more"}
{"text":"Even though you just opened your food is excellent and we will be back to many more times. So thankful you're right down the street we are very excited to have you in the area. Keep up the good work and we will keep coming back"}
{"text":"It was Cards Against Humanity night and I needed a food tray pronto to feed a party of 10.  These fine folks knocked it out in less than 20 minutes.  I didn't want one of their standard trays, so I customized mine with The BBQ Chick, The Bobbie, and The Capastrami.  The BBQ Chick was the best and I heard rave reviews tonight that it was great too.  

Thanks to Justin and the crew for making it happen in less than 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Delicious! The Bobbie is the favorite of my son, but I go for the cheesesteak with extra peppers! Super fresh bread, great meat toppings. You're in and out in 5 minutes. What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Okay, so listen here... I don't know what they put in that cranberry sauce but it tastes like Thanksgiving in your mouth.  It's heavenly.  It's saucy.  It has a nice bite that will leave you eating the entire sandwich even if you're not that hungry.

Upon finding out that the creperie we were dying to eat at wasn't opening for another hour, we gave up the wait and went in search of something to eat that would hopefully make us just as happy.  We stumbled into Capriottis feeling saddened with growling stomachs, but by the end of the meal were glad we chose sandwiches over those lousy ol' crepes.

Whatever you do, order something with cranberry sauce doused all over it.  I opted for the Cran-Slam Club which consists of homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, ham, mayo, and lettuce sliced on white bread because they had run out of wheat that day.  I ate the entire thing.  A few months later, I tried to recreate that masterpiece and let me tell you, it didn't match up to the heavenly sandwich I had previously indulged in at Capriottis.

Needless to say, I'll be heading back because The Bobbie is calling my name!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly! But the shop seemed dirty I leaned on the stainless steal counter and it was very sticky I assume from grease as the walls and hood around the grill looked covered in it."}
{"text":"Such a sad review to write. Let me start by appeasing the disbelievers, I am originally from New York but grew up in Delaware right down the street from the Capriottis by the New Castle airport. Growing up I ate there at least three times a week consuming large amounts of Cheese steaks, Italians and Bobbys over a 22 year span. Military service moved me away from my beloved sandwich shop and I crave Capriottis often. Every trip home the first thing I do even before seeing family is stop for a meal, usually a small steak, Italian and bobby to split with myself, wife and son. Being a die hard loyal Caps fan I was disappointed after eating here. We took a trip north for the recent bike week and stopped off for a meal. The steak was flavorless and dry, bread was chewing inside like it should be but dry and crumbly outside like it was left out for hours prior to service. Bobby was good like back home except the stuffing was off and tasted a bit of stove top and the bread was the same as the steaks. I know Caps, and if the Margolets \"founders\" saw this they would be ashamed. I won't be back..... Avoid at all costs, the authenticity is lacking in a major way and the food is substandard."}
{"text":"Capastrami is the Best!!!! The Bobbie is good to but I have to say the Capastrami stole my heart. Whether it be on the to or leaving Vegas I always have to stop by and grab a sandwich. If your going to Vegas, this place is a MUST. 

FYI- I just came back from Vegas last weekend and they put tables and chairs inside. No more walking to Del Taco to eat. Yay!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My first time going here I wasn't expecting much but it ended up being very good. The sub I ordered was HUGE! It was extremely filling. I thought there was no way I could finish it but it was to good to put down. There's alot of room for parking in the back which was nice and there's a little bagel shop next door."}
{"text":"I am a native of Delaware, having been raised on Capriotti's my entire life, long before any of you knew what a Bobbie or Capastrami is.... and I have come to the realization that Capriotti's has slipped. Ever since the family sold it to one of their franchisees a few years ago, the quality has slipped a notch or two.  The rolls are not the same, the ingredients are not as fresh, the meats dont seem to be as of high quality as they once were when it was owned by the Capriotti family.  And this is not a one-time slip up, I have visited many Capriotti's shops all over the USA, including Vegas, Arizona, New Jersey, and Delaware of course. And the quality is not the same anymore.  Sorry to report this.  Sure Cap's is better than Subway, but Cap's is not in a class by itself anymore.  It's a shame."}
{"text":"5 stars. Excellent sandwich shop & service. They make anything u want. In 15 minutes or less. You cant go wrong with this place. It's not expensive.  And the portion size is fantastic. Thank you"}
{"text":"The Bobbie is delicious!!!!! My boyfriend and I went there absolutely starving on our way out of town. Went based on the high reviews on Yelp. Together we polished off the 20 inch! It was HUGE, but so good we savored every bite. Service was great & gave us the mayo on the side & even extra cranberry sauce as well (cus I like it saucy!) So tasty! Awesome portions & quality. Pinks in Miami has a similar sandwich called \"The Thanksgiving\" which also has gravy. Both very good."}
{"text":"I go here regularly. If you've never been, get the \"Bobbie\". This is one place I get takeout when we have company in town. One large sandwich can easily feed two adults. Get some chips and drinks to go with. I also get their catering platters when I have a business lunch at the office. 

My favorite though is the capistrami (reminds me of a Rueben) & my kids love the turkey. Bread is fresh daily at great buns bakery... I think that makes all the difference."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches but for the price you can  do better elsewhere. Very good customer service but I've found bigger and better tasting sandwiches for the same price in the same location."}
{"text":"Best, cleanest Capriotti's in town! So happy it opened. I love how you can stay to eat on real plates. Plus the manager is really nice and food always comes out perfect."}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheesesteak I've ever had hands down.Tuna Sandwiches are very tasty and fresh. They also offer speedy delivery. Hassle free and delicious sandwiches. They do not disappoint."}
{"text":"I like to think of myself as a sandwich aficionado, so when I heard of this shop being voted America's favorite sandwich I had to give it a try. If you're looking for some speciality sandwiches and a variety of fresh produce and fresh cut meats then this is your shop! It's well priced and large portions. I was able to split a small sandwich with a friend for dinner! It's definitely amongst the top sandwich shops on my long list of noteworthy sandwiches. 

ALSO, as if a delicious sandwich isn't enough, the customer service was outstanding! I believe Zachary helped us today and I didn't get the other guys name but they were very helpful with our decision making process. I was pleased with their sandwich and dessert recommendations. They went above and beyond with their customer service! I will definitely revisit this location for quality service and food."}
{"text":"I had the cheesesteak, the meat wasn't especially juicy or flavorful, but the sandwich was put together faithfully.  I know it's not their best sandwich, but I say don't have it on the menu if you don't want to be judged by it.  Chips were awful; although they didn't make them, there aren't too many alternatives for sides.  I ordered the large, and it is indeed large, but I would've settled for less if it tasted that much better."}
{"text":"Best sammich I had in awhile. Definitely comparable to firehouse subs in my opinion. I had the capastrami n it was bomb next time I'm goin for the steak n cheese. My dad had that one so I took a bite n that one seems better then mine honestly."}
{"text":"Capastrami....very, very good, comes with homemade slaw and Russian dressing. Small is plenty for one...almost 8 bucks. They don't have fountain drinks, only bottled."}
{"text":"We were lured to this sandwich shop by the giant banner out front declaring they have the BEST SANDWICHES IN AMERICA.  Quite a bold statement that we had to test out. I got the capastrami and she got the cheesesteak.
Verdict: not the best sandwich in America. They forgot my order.... I had to ask about my sandwich 10 min after she got hers. Sandwich was good, but nothing to go out of my way for.
I will probably not be returning."}
{"text":"Once a month on a Friday my boss gets the entire company lunch. Well, we had capriotti's sub trays. Capri..who? was my thought. Never heard of the place but my coworkers were ranting on its way better than the more popular sub chains. 

My first bite was amazing, it had turkey,ham,cranberry, it was delicious! Looked into their menu brochure and it was called the cran-slam club. I was definitely hooked after my first bite. I did try a second flavor and it was called the bobby. Also another great sandwich, but definitely didn't finish it. I was stuffed by the 3rd bite. 

The following day I had plenty of left overs and it was still delicious. I gave it a 5 star because I was taken by surprise of how good it was, I didn't have to drive for lunch, and Ashley confirmed that the order was correct and nothing was missing. So that is a 5 stars in my book any day. 

I will for sure stop by at least once this upcoming week."}
{"text":"Great food. Best cheesesteak ever. 

Sevice at this location sucks. One register open at peak lunch rush time. Slow people. Unorganized. I called in an order. Waited inside for 10 minutes in line. Waited another 20 minutes to find out my food had been sitting there getting cold the whole time. Barely made it back to work just as my lunch hour ended. 

The last time I was there they put cheese on my sandwich, even though I specifically asked for no cheese. Didnt notice until I got back to work. No time to go back. 

This place needs new management and someone who knows how to make a schedule."}
{"text":"So my girl was craving capriotti's. I got the capapastrami and it was awful. They forgot the Russian dressing and the coleslaw was blend. Capriotti's used to be good but I guess people don't care about their jobs anymore. Never eating here again."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I eat Capriotti's pretty regularly. This location is about 2 miles from my house so we usually stop in and order food to go. They do have a few small tables to dine in, but I prefer take out.  I love their sandwiches. I like them all, but my favorite is probably the capistrami. It's hot pastrami with cheese, thousand island dressing and coleslaw piled high on a fresh, chewy white roll. I usually ask for sweet and hot peppers to be added to my sandwich for a little extra flavor, and sometimes I ask for them on the side. They are always willing to accommodate and never charge extra. I also like the Bobbie which is Thanksgiving dinner on a roll. Turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce, mmmm good. They have many more hot and cold sandwiches to choose from, as well as salads, brownies and cookies, and a large selection of Wise chips. 

My last visit we both wanted the capistrami, so we ordered a large which is a 20\" sandwich, it's freaking huge. It's so much food and we usually have some leftover for later. Everything is made fresh to order, so expect a wait especially if they are busy. It is definitely worth it though. I have always received great service from the workers, they always greet us with a smile and are so thankful when you give them a tip, or \"beer money\" as they say. Right now they are doing a promotion of you bring in 5 or more non-perishable food items, you can get a free upgrade on your sub. The food goes to the Rescue Mission of S. Nevada! Free up size for a great cause, great job Capriotti's!!!"}
{"text":"First timers, ordered 2 subs to go. Got home and had the wrong order. Drove back, gave the employee back the subs and reordered. She was very apologetic .... But then got home and it didn't have half the toppings I asked for. So We just ate them, was not about to drive back for a second time. But my big question is: aren't employees suppose to have their hair tied back or at least have a hat on? That turned me right off"}
{"text":"If you want an awesome sandwich, then come here.  Someone mentioned they would prefer Subway to this place because it's better.  I disagree!  You get a better quality product here vs subway.  The bread is always fresh and delicious.  Plus, you get more for your money.  Seriously, comparing this place to Subway isn't a true apples to apples comparison.  I love it because it reminds me of a deli I went to a great deal in New York City.   They don't skimp on the meat like other places and the employees are always in a good mood."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are always awesome!  This is the first time that I visited and wasn't greeted.  We stood at the cash register for 4 minutes.  The chick that was making a sandwich didn't acknowledge us until my boyfriend said are you the only one working? Then she called someone else. 

There was no sorry for your wait or anything.  I'm highly disappointed!!  She took our order but acted as though she didn't want to.  Seriously, if you hate your job that much then by all means...quit."}
{"text":"Love their food its never disappointing and always fresh, we always enjoy the cheese steak and of course you can never go wring with a bobby!!"}
{"text":"I'll start while I still have half my sandwich. BOMB.....i usually only yelp when it's good.... well this is the shit. Walked in and all the staff was on it. Suggestions were flowing and I went with the Philly. Having just come back from there. It's the best cheese steak I have had. .... finished my sandwich and I told my girl let's get one tomorrow on our way home.  Good stuff...thanks guys"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich shop with good original sandwiches. The Bobbi is always good and the russian sauce is perfect pairing for the cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Worst service in town   Day manager can't manage and is extremely rude. I waited 30 minutes for one order and today when I got there, they had not even started the order! Night crew is much more efficient! Capriotti's needs to clean house at this location!"}
{"text":"Well I think most of us know about Capriotti's so I won't go on about the Capistrami or Bobbie or even the meatball subs, but these guys have been great so far.  Called in orders every other week and they are ready to go.  The $3 off survey coupons have been helpful too."}
{"text":"While I was with some friends and family in the Scottsdale area, we saw a sign that read \"Best Sandwich in America,\" and given we are red-blooded God-fearing Americans, we immediately went in. 

Unfortunately, I have a gluten-allergy and was not able to eat here, so this review is on behalf of the ones I was with. 

First, being located in the heart of Olde-Towne (not sure why the 'e's at the ending of those words are necessary) Scottsdale, this place has an optimal location that makes for a fun lunch and half day trip in town. 

I was told that the sandwiches were truly world-class. They come in sizes that go up to 20\" in length. Moreover, they have original and unique sandwich options that utilize fresh ingredients, such as, cranberry sauce and stuffing. 

The reason this review is not a 5-star review was due to the fact that the service has room for improvement. It's not that the employees were rude, they just made a few off-colored comments while we were there. 

Nonetheless, if your in old town, make sure you give this place a try."}
{"text":"Cute little sandwich shop , the people were friendly and helpful , the atmosphere was happy and welcoming , I ordered the cheese steak 9\" sub with Gilled onions . The bread was a little soft  for my liking but the steak was cooked perfect and there were plenty of steak , cheese and onions , the prices are very reasonable :) overall very satisfied and would return for another great sandwich :)"}
{"text":"SO YUMMY!  My hubby and I ordered the veggie cheese steak sandwhich.  The bread here is awesome!  Very fresh!  The sandwich had a ton of filling!  Tons of veggie chicken, peppers and onions and melted cheese.  I also tried the salad my mom got with the cranberry dressing, really unique and flavorfull.  My friend got the meatball sandwich and it looked awesome!  He said it tasted just as awesome hehe.  Will come back next time i'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to try this place out after hearing a recommendation from a friend a while back on social media. They would not stop raving about the Capistrami Sandwich. I know a lot of the reviews here hype up the Bobbie but I for one am not a huge fan of cranberry sauce. 
 So I would definitely be back for the Capistrami the coleslaw and dressing makes this thing. Also the bread was really fresh that day. The pastrami was perfect!"}
{"text":"Better than Earl Sandwich!! Don't believe me, try it and find out! Everytime I'm in Vegas, it's our first stop in getting a bite to eat before the maddness begins.

Eat half there and save the other half for later. You can thank me later!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever at this location. The location is nasty they prepare the food with trashcans right near the stove. Employees were rude and told us as soon as we walked in they only had small sandwiches...ok no biggie then with an attitude the cashier proceeds to tell us that she's going to charge us more for ordering the smaller sandwiches rather than for the 20\" which we came for although we'd be losing 2\" total. She starts yelling and arguing with me...yea I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Always Great Pastrami Sandwich's.
I've had them many times.
Very consistent."}
{"text":"Love Capriottis. 

Been going to these in SD for awhile. Happy to see there are a few in Vegas area. 

People very friendly at this location. 

Place was clean and nice. 

Kids ordered meatball sandwich and chicken noodle soup. 

Wifey and i ordered THE BOBBIE. 

AWESOME SANDWICH. ITS THANKSGIVING ON A ROLL! TURKEY WAS AO GOOD. STUFFING. CRANBERRY. 

Be back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I finally got to try Capriotti's. I've seen them in Reno and have always wanted to make a stop just never got around to it. But with Capriotti's being conveniently located in Green Valley's food court, no more excuses. I had the famous \"Bobbie\" filled with fresh chunks of turkey, stuffing and cranberry. Oh so good. Reminds me of the turkey sandwiches we would make at my grandmas after thanksgiving! My husband had the capastrami. His sandwich was also filled with flavor. My suggestion, ask for a little extra coleslaw :) 

There was a line (approximately 6-8 people) since a workshop had just let out for lunch but it moved fairly fast. My only issue was there were only two people working. One the cook and the other a cashier. When you check in they have an offer for a free dessert, but the cashier didn't know how to apply it in the register and since we didn't want to hold up the line we told her to just forget about it. Thought maybe she'd just give us the cookie for the check in but no. Oh well no worries."}
{"text":"Quick service with a smile. An establishment frequented by the military population, and for good reason. Quality food and great value. We will definitely return. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Came here to try out \"the Bobbie,\" shown on the wall as \"voted the greatest sandwich in America.\" Though there was no way the sandwich could live up to that type of hype, it was still pretty good.

Containing a ton of turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and some mayo, each bite of the sandwich was like a nostalgic taste of thanksgiving. The stuffing was well seasoned and there was a generous portion of ingredients. 

There are several sizes available: ~$6 for a 9\",  ~$9 for a 12\", and  ~$12 for a 20\", with the latter being the best deal if you can split it."}
{"text":"Terrible first experience! I  ordered a sandwich for delivery to my work, I didnt have time to run out to grab something.  The sandwich was made completely wrong, i requested certain veggies/condiments and none were included but others i did not ask for were put on. I dont eat mayo, and the sandwich was drenched in mayo.  So this sandwich went straight into the trash.  I will never order from again."}
{"text":"This shop is amazing. Working with Ben their catering manager they have assisted us in a couple of events at our organization. They are responsive, timely and so accommodating. They were asked to deliver food four 4 days with special orders and we were very specific about time for delivery. Not only did they get every delivery correct they were ontime. The food quality was awesome. Recently I forgot to order a few items for a delivery and in 10 mins they came back with the product we needed. I am super impressed with this shops thoroughness and customer service. This owner also has a shop on Boulder Hwy and they assisted us with delivery to our Henderson Location and were super! They are great representatives of this brand and we will work with them again. Thank you!."}
{"text":"Put in a last minute order for 14 lunch box for pick up in 30 mins; they took my order and delivered it.  Definitely coming back for my future catering."}
{"text":"My friends told me about a sandwich called \"The Bobbie\". I got to Capriotti's and ordered one.

First bite, fresh chewy roll, some mayo, little turkey.

Seconde bite, all the above and now I'm getting the cranberry sauce and stuffing. It's a Thanksgiving explosion in your mouth!

Get it~!"}
{"text":"Decent sandwich   Very friendly, great service. I will have to try the pastrami next time. I would definitely go back for a sandwich on the fly."}
{"text":"The worst experience I have ever had... My boyfriend took me here a while back when we came to Vegas from Los Angeles to visit his parents (They live in Southern Highlands)... He kept saying how wonderful this place was so I was forced to try. We show up and immediately I felt tension in the air. Everything I asked about on the menu apparently wasn't available because: \"The stove is turned off\"... \"We ran out of that bread\"... \"There isn't anymore meat\"... I mean, I kid you not, he literally left us with nothing left to order except maybe 3 or 4 items which weren't at all appealing to either of us. Mind you, as we were asking them questions, both the manager and some kid kept smiling at each other like this was some joke. I told my boyfriend lets just go somewhere else, this isn't looking good anymore, he agreed. As we walked out, the manager called out to us \"FAG**TS\" and started laughing with his employee. This was by far the most disgusting place I have ever been. The employees were extremely inappropriate homophobes and the establishment itself was appalling. I pray someone shuts this place down."}
{"text":"I am a native Delawarean so I am super partial to Capriotti's. I invited some of my Vegas buddies to go here for lunch with me a couple of weeks ago and I was pretty disappointed. The food was really good, but that's where the enjoyment stopped. When I got there I really had to use the restroom when I asked the staff if they could unlock the bathroom in the rear. They told me it will be just a few moments. Having to go so badly, I decided to go around to the back of the building and wait hoping that they would see me go back there and help me more quickly. I waited back there for about 10 minutes and nobody came to the door so I messaged my friend to ask the staff to open the door for me and they said they would in a few moments. It's OK I'm about another five minutes before they came and unlocked the door for me. That was annoying because I really had to go. 

I was also annoyed because I figured that my food will be cold once I got back inside however, after about 20 minutes from the time that I ordered my food was not ready. About five minutes later it came up. 25 minutes at lunchtime is pretty unacceptable in a sandwich shop. Then I took a look at the sandwich and it was done incorrectly. So although she was very nice, she had to remake it. That's OK about another five minutes so about 30 minutes to get a sandwich. Unsatisfactory in my book. 

I will continue to go to Capriotti's but I will definitely not be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Really good sandwich shop! This location does not have good parking and that may be a detterent for some. I ordered the vegetarian turkey sandwich. It's soy based meat substitute turkey. I'm not a vegetarian, and I was not disappointed. My friend got the Bobbie and demolished it."}
{"text":"I love to get served by Joshua he's very professional and interactive with his customers. Always makes sure your taken care of and happy with your order."}
{"text":"Never have I EVER gone into any sandwich shop with only 8 people waiting for their food and had to wait 40 minutes for a sandwich. They had 6 employees working and couldn't make a cold turkey sandwich in less then 15 minutes?  If you were understaffed or on a long wait wouldn't you tell your customers when they ordered that the wait til was that long? This is the third time I have been in this establishment and either waited longer then 25 minutes or gotten the completely wrong sandwich. HORRIBLE customer service."}
{"text":"Capriottis is a sandwich shop that you must try when you are in las Vegas.  There are probably a dozen of them around town and now there is even one in Beverly hills, ca.  All the places are small and simple but they have two of the best sandwiches on this planet.  The first is the Bobby which consists of fresh turkey, mayo, stuffing,and cranberry sauce.  It's like thanksgiving in a sandwich.  Nothing beats fresh turkey in a sandwich and not many places have it.  I opt to have my cranberry sauce on the side.  My other favorite sandwich is called the capistrami.  This one consists of lean pastrami, coleslaw and a special dressing.  These two sandwiches are a must try, and I guarantee you will be hooked, as many of my friends have!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with Capriotti's. Although, the prices can be a bit pricey, but most of the time it's definitely worth it.

The Bobby is absolutely amazing if you love having turkey sandwiches. Turkey, gravy, & stuffing in a delicious roll [it comes with cranberry sauce, but I'm not a big fan of any cranberry sauce on my turkey]. But while the Bobby is amazing, their Cheese steak is by far my favorite. You definitely have to get both sweet and hot peppers to make it extra delicious.

The one thing I dislike about this specific location is that they only offer two sizes, while most other Capriottis offers three different sizes. The Red Rock location, for some reason, does not offer large sandwiches. 

Other than that, go and enjoy. Eat a sandwich while gambling, or even sneak it into the movie theater to enjoy during your current movie choice."}
{"text":"Capristrano or cheese steak are my goto's at Capriottis. This one I typically hit up at least once on every Vegas visit since it's inexpensive, filling and just a solid sandwich! Other locations are good too but I prefer this one."}
{"text":"I go extra miles to get my sandwiches here cause1. staff are always friendly and always greets me as soon as I walk in. 
2. ofcourse the tasty food.
3. Very satisfied customer"}
{"text":"Meat and veggies are fresh, service is great, prices are reasonable and sandwiches are HUGE!
My favorites are the bobby and the cole turkey. (Capastrami is uber great, too!) 
Another nice thing is that they will hollow out the hoagie roll for you if you don't like so much bread."}
{"text":"Got the biggest steak and xtra cheese with all the add ons. Sweet peppers, hot peppers, onion, mushroom. And shredded lettuce lite mayo on bread. I get home no cheese on sub no shredded lettuce. This is my second time requesting a sub the way i want it but they dont follow my order for instructions. Im disappointed i will find another caprioti's that is attention to detail."}
{"text":"Amazing subs for a decent price. Capriottis is way better than subway and jimmy johns. Spend the extra buck and go here, you won't regret it. The capastromi is the best sub on their menu. Every time I order, it comes out perfect. I can't complain about anything here. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place. Cool people and great sandwiches. Capastromi is hands-down the best sub ever made."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The Bobbie is one of the best turkey sandwiches I had by far. As people stated here, it is Thanksgiving on a bun. The cranberry sauce makes it very tasty. The place has great sandwiches and service."}
{"text":"Where to begin with this delicious sandwich shop!!! I had thirteen guest in my party and we all enjoyed our meals very much. I ordered a medium meatball with provolone cheese and pickles...it was so tasty I bought a second one. My husband ordered the Philly cheese steak and he really enjoyed it. They also ordered the capastrami and we really enjoyed it as well...another sandwich was the turkey....least favorite.  On top of the food being delicious, the staff is amazingly friendly!

There was nothing bad to say about this place with the exception of the very limited sitting space. There are four tables with three seats each TOTAL.

IF YOU'RE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY STOP BY!!!!"}
{"text":"I think their menu is smaller here! But still hits the spot!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches...the robbie and the cole turkey were fantastic!!! Service was quick, seating is really limited but as deli's go this is one of the best!"}
{"text":"The Bobbie is just the best! I do you love the Capastrami and the mushroom cheesesteak as well. Been eating Capriotti's for the last 20 years for a reason ;-)"}
{"text":"Was craving pastrami, yum!!! Will definitely be back, to get my sandwich fix...Service was great, parking in back was good. Just wish they were there when I used to live in the neighborhood..."}
{"text":"Yummy eats! Fair price. Good location. Try the cheese steak and italian and be sure to add a brownie for the road. It's all made fresh while you wait."}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone, got there 15min later and was told a couple minutes. Waited for 15-20min, then it turns out our sandwiches had been ready for quite some time, they never called our name. Or maybe they did, but couldn't hear the employee because he talks super soft. I can hardly hear what he says when I'm in front of him. The food is good but customer service needs work."}
{"text":"Oh Capriotti's, why must your sandwiches be so tasty (and borderline addictive)? My journey to Capriotti's was only a matter of time. I hear the buzz of 'free sandwiches' going around the office for a place called Capriotti's at their new location. Alright, I missed that opportunity, but a place that will offer free subs is a place that I need to check out. A few weeks went by and I had forgotten the name (insert sad face). Then my boss comes in with a sub in an nondenominational wrapper (my way of saying it was just a plain wrapping paper - no logo), as he opens it I can smell how delicious it would taste. No sooner did he say how tasty it was (a Chicken Philly Cheese Steak), it was gone. Too good to just let it sit idly? Alright, now I have to try it.

So the following day, I made it a point to stop there for lunch. I got the same thing that taunted my olfactory perception the day before. Chicken Cheese Steak, as they call it, is one of their 'hot stuff' options. Back to the office I returned with it, and finished it in a short amount of time! Did this sandwich really just happen or had I dreamt it into existence? Okay, I had to go back again to make sure it was as good as I thought it was.

This time I tried their Cran-Slam Club with turkey and cranberries. I missed the part where they said they used three slices of bread. I looked at this thick sandwich and wondered how I was going to fit it in my mouth. Well, don't worry - I figured that out. Surprisingly, the extra slice of bread enhanced the sandwich. I think I was full after I finished it too. It's a tongue twister to order too, I accidentally called it the Cran-Clam Slub (or Cran-Crab Club) - which I'd be interested to try as well.

I can see myself returning for more sandwiches, like I said before - they're borderline addictive. Either I need to stop now or just accept it. But, I am only giving this spot 4 out of 5 stars. The rent is just too damn high! Woops (right meme, wrong phrase) - the pricing is a bit high. I can't justify the price to myself to eat there regularly enough for it to become a weekly stop. I do appreciate the 3 sizes that their subs come in, but adjust those prices a bit and you'll become irresistible

The other complaint I have is specific to this location, the convenience of getting to this location absolutely sucks. One entrance only. First trip here, I turned early and got myself nearly lost in a random neighborhood and had to come back out to find the only entrance. Then when you get into the parking lot, you have to go to the furthest section of the parking lot. Exiting sucks too, I thought I was leaving, turns out I accidentally found the underground parking for the building.

Give me easy access and I will surely tell all my friends of the positive experience I had. But when you're annoyed coming in - enjoy a great meal - and leave frustrated with the lack of accessibility, it'll leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth. Not necessarily Capriotti's fault - but they picked that location and they should have picked better."}
{"text":"They deliver which is always good.  The sub I got was huge so had half for lunch and half for dinner.  The turkey sub was A-OK."}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying that I'm really glad a new little eatery opened in Aliante. This community is tight. 
I love me some Cap's but this location is cheep with there meat, slaw, dressing, and other toppings. Maybe because they are new employees. But I work down by the airport and they load the sandwich up. And so does the location inside the Aliante casino. I don't want to waste $9 on a bread sandwich.

Oh and when you tip other locations have there saying.....tip money!!   Gas money!!!!   Rent money!!!!

NOT THIS LOCATION. You tip them and you can hear crickets. No reply at all. 

Maybe send these new employees to old stores and let them train them. 

Not an extraordinary experience"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the Bobbie ever since I saw it on TV. So I was in Vegas and looking for something to eat that was not on the strip. I like Earl's but I've been there. They have more than one Capriotti location and it was my chance!

The Bobbie is Thanksgiving in a sandwich. You know the day after Thanksgiving when you stuff the turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing all into a sandwich and it so so good. Well, the Bobbie is like that all year long. I liked the sandwich but I am not a fan of a huge amount of bread. If there was a bit less bun it would have been PERFECT. The stuffing was delicious. If you don't like sweet in your sandwich it would have been perfect. 

My husband had the grilled Italian. It was spicy, meaty and delicious.

The staff was friendly and they really need a Southern California location."}
{"text":"Voted Best Sandwich in America, need I say more???? Need a solid sammie or a super hero then go for the roasted pulled turkey - no pre-cut slices from some food factory; just hand crafted quality... Not just Vegas, not Nevada - the entire United States of America - all the way over to the East Coast where they have this thing called a Dagwood..."}
{"text":"Stay away from this location. I called in an order they said 35 minutes. When I get there they tell me they are \"out of meatballs and were wondering if I maybe wanted something different\" ??? Dude You had my number a phone call would have made you seem less incompetant. Go to Sahara and Durango its worth the drive"}
{"text":"Decent cheesesteak for the area... I'm from the East Coast, this is the closest around for a good one."}
{"text":"3 stars because the store was filthy!  The back room had old food all over the floor and the sanitation buckets under the table had nasty towels in them. The grill...OMG IT WAS DISGUSTING! looked like it hadn't been cleaned in god knows how long.  The sandwiches were awesome.  This is why they didn't get 1 star. Needs better management no doubt."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas and my uber driver told me about this place. It's great!! I ordered a 20inch cheese steak to share with a friend, it was amazing. The staff was great too, JD and Dylan were so helpful and provided the best service. I will be returning if I ever come back to Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is a chain? How did I not eat here all this time? Excellent sandwich shop that needs to expand like everywhere! The sandwiches here are the complete opposite of Subway, unhealthy and delicious. We ordered 3 sandwiches for my attending physician and his employees and I offered to carry them out. He insisted that I don't but I did anway. And boy those babies were heavy! I actually had to contract my muscles to keep the sandwiches from hitting the ground. Anyway, great spot for lunch but share (or just eat a little for lunch and then for dinner and then again for dinner snack)."}
{"text":"We ordered a tray of sandwiches  for the office . It was delivered  timely. The turkey  sandwich  had very little  meat . They were inconsistent  . Normally  there is plenty  of meat but this time it was disappointing.  The cookies  were good . They told us to order one and half sandwiches for each person and ended up with 50 % too much food . I was very disappointed.  I will  pass on using  this place in the near future"}
{"text":"Their turkey and stuffing sandwich is absolutely yummy... It is like the day after Thanksgiving any day you want:)  Also their Roast Beef with coleslaw is a great choice.  Pastrami is really good.  My husband love the steak and cheese with mushrooms."}
{"text":"We split the medium Bobby and a custom salad, with stuffing.  Both were much larger than we expected, and the salad was very fresh.  The Bobby (turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayonnaise) is apparently the most popular sandwich (just like Thanksgiving!), but some of the others on their menu also look really good."}
{"text":"Everyone tells me this place is great but I got a turkey sandwich and a roast beef sandwich and they were both terribly dry. The menu is a little confusing. My friends told me next time get the special stuff from the middle bottom of the menu, that it's great. I'll definitely try it again cause other people seem to love it."}
{"text":"Been to Aliante Station store and wanted to try new one @ the Nature Park...one cashier, 7 people in back, 7 people in line @ noon on Saturday..not a good start...Aliante has one person taking orders and one making sandwiches and was still faster that here...ordering specific items for a sub took a while because register not synced to list on menuboard, so a couple of wanted items were left off...I got the Bobbie...1st bite noticed everything was cold, especially the stuffing...I know at previous stores it was always a warm sandwich, but here you have to ask for it to be hot (cold stuffing and cranberry sauce is not good)..but more troublesome with the first bite came a fingernail-size bone. Politely I went up and asked for the manager, was given a \"supervisor\" (had the only grey tee-shirt on and was making the sandwiches for a large order)..showed her the bone and was told \"Oh,sorry.\"...put bone and napkin on counter where she left it and went back to sandwiches..5 minutes later, another employee came and gave me 2- $2.00 off coupons, which on the back said would expire 3 days later...So minus my $2 tip, having a cold,bony Bobbie was worth $2 off, in the next 3 days apparently...Having managed businesses, I would have immediately comped the whole meal (my wife and I) and then followed up with coupons that would have at least covered the cost of my sandwich. This appears to be a flagship store, very big and nice inside, but seriously doubt the training of employees. That's a management problem, and from other commenters, it's caused by having no managers...Somebody has to be in charge with this many employees and not be on the line but..wait for it...managing!! If you're up this way, drive 1/2 a block to Aliante Station until this store gets professional."}
{"text":"Came in to get my favorite the cheese steak today and Alina and Sean were both great vibes and a huge help. Excellent customer service, fast and delicious food! Always recommending this place to my friends and fam! Gotta check it out !!"}
{"text":"Chain, but new location recently opened on the northwest corner of Val Vista and Baseline.

Friendly staff, clean restaurant and the cheese steaks are **killer**. 

One glance at the bulbous flab hanging over my belt will tell you that I can pack away the food. But a medium size cheese steak (12\") fills me up. Can't imagine downing the large (20\") solo. It's stuffed with meat on soft toasty bread. 

Get the shrooms too, you'll thank me."}
{"text":"We had ate at a Capriotti's one other time and wasn't pleased the first time.  This time we were both very happy with our sandwiches.  Service was quick and the food was excellent.  We have since ordered it twice and had it delivered."}
{"text":"driving home from the airport the other day, out of gas, stop to get gas, there's a capriotti's staring at me.

me: \"hey, are you hungry? wanna go to capriotti's?\"
hubby: \"is that where you got that thanksgiving sandwich you brought home the other day?\"
me: \"YES!\"
hubby: \"let's go!\"
me: \"you wanna go to that one (pointing to the one next to the gas station) or one closer to home?\"
hubby: \"is there one?\"
me: \"idk. let me check yelp!\"

low and behold......there's one within minutes from our house!!!
yes, i should have known this already but i only just recently discovered capriotti's so gimme a break!

it was 15 minutes til closing by the time we arrived but everyone was super nice about it and didn't make us feel rushed nor did anyone show even a hint of impatience or frustration.
this, my friends, is rare in vegas.
i ordered the bobbie...vegetarian, of course.
the hubby had the capastrami.

we were full and happy and plan to go back.......prolly tonight.
=o)"}
{"text":"Jimmy Johns is cheaper and better ... The Capriotti food is heavy ... and it doesn't taste as good as you think it should taste"}
{"text":"I was debating on what my last meal would be before I got my wisdom teeth extracted last week and I didn't have to think too long and hard.  Capriotti's has been a favorite of mine for a very long time... I strictly only order the Bobbie or the Philly.  Most times, I can't decide, so I force my fiance to split the sandwiches with me so I can have half of each! 

This location is the one that I frequent the most.  I always call my order in on the phone and can expect it to be ready for me within 10 minutes, so I'm in and out in no time.  I don't know what I would do without my Capriotti's fix.  My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it... only a few more days until I can have some (I hope)!"}
{"text":"Most of the time this place is a zoo and the staff is very impatient. If you get a hot sandwich make sure you call ahead because the wait is ridiculous. Now for the actual sandwiches. They are just okay. Nothing really special for the price."}
{"text":"Literally the best philly cheese steak I've had in my life. They stay open pretty late too"}
{"text":"Thank you YELP! We were in Las Vegas for a day trip (freakin' Time Share presentations) and didn't know where to go for a quick lunch. We looked up the local restaurants on our trusty iPhone app and quickly found this sandwich joint close by.

I'm not big on sandwiches at all. I mean, come on! I can make a sandwich at home, why eat out for a sandwich. Well, Capriotti's will make me reconsider the art of the sandwich deli. \"The Bobbie\" sandwich was highly recommended. Wow, fresh roasted chicken shredded for a lovely sub with stuffing, cranberry sauce . It's thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich! Delicious. I definitely think it's the fresh turkey that makes this sandwich so good. It was huge and genorously stuffed (that's what she said!, Sorry, too good to pass up). Thanks Capriotti!"}
{"text":"Good food great service. The guy at the counter on 4/8/2018 served me even though the were closing in 2 minutes. He didn't seem upset that I came in super close to closing time."}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwiches in town! I've tried the bobby, capastrami, the philly, and chicken philly. All were equally awesome! The price isn't bad for what you get, and the food is always fresh. I've been numerous times and I have never been disappointed yet. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Come here for lunch often because I work in town square. They are always super fast and are good at getting my order correct. I also like how they have a really good variety of menu items to choose from. Love that they give a discount but wish it was a little more considering how often we all eat there ."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's, we order it at work for extended staff meetings because they deliver. 

However, this location delivers when it wants to. The reason for the inconsistency they claim is based on whether or not they are busy. I will never understand why you'd miss out on sales.

We were excited when this location opened, but we're missing our old location that was always able to deliver."}
{"text":"New to the neighborhood and I love Capriotti's I normally go to the one on rainbow & 215 but this ones closest to my house! Only reason I give them 4 stars is because I asked for no mayo extra Russian dressing on my Cole turkey they got the no mayo rite but also didn't put any Russian dressing at all and I got it to go so I didn't find out till I got home. Luckily it had coleslaw or the sandwich would've ben bone dry! Other than that the service was good and got my food in a timely manner! Will try it again hopefully they get it rite?"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time at a capriotti's. I'm so glad they added inches to their sub sizes. The first time I ordered a medium and it was huge and my husband ordered a large and it was like 20\". 
I ordered the cole turkey which is pretty yummy. It's fresh pulled turkey, with mayo, Russian dressing, coleslaw and cheese. 
My husband has a steak sandwich. He said it was pretty good. It definitely didn't look at fat as my sandwich did."}
{"text":"Fast service.
Friendly people.
Fat sandwiches.


Ffffffffffantastic!"}
{"text":"I usually love Capriotti's, but I am starting to revise my opinion. The past 2 times I have ordered sandwiches (The Bobbie and The Capistrami,my favs) they have been MUCH smaller(skinnier bread,not filled up and shorter then their advertised size) and the filling stops short of both ends of the sandwiches by at about an inch. No bueno!! Not to mention I was comparing my old take home menu with the new one they have out and the price of the sandwiches have gone up by $2-$3.50 each!! I think they are under new managemen/ownership because things don't seem the same in this shop and I have been coming here for 6 plus years."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's.  This is by far my favorite place to eat in Law Vegas.  Yes, this $7-8 sandwich tops the much more expensive food you can get at the buffets or other fancy joints in town.  The turkey sandwiches are made with real turkey, as in thanksgiving turkey not lunch meat slices.  The \"bobby\" is their most popular sandwich, which is like a thanksgiving leftovers orgy with turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.  Personally, my favorite is the \"plain\" turkey sandwich with sweet peppers, hot peppers, and pickles.

My only complaint about Capriotti's is that they serve Pepsi, but I guess no one is perfect."}
{"text":"The Bobbie is the most delicious sandwich in the world.   The staff is usually pretty friendly but at times they can be a bit slow.  During the summer this shop can get uncomfortably warm."}
{"text":"bobbieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!

thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich!
freaking genius!

i've lived in vegas since '04 and only recently tried capriotti's for the first time.
what the hell have i been thinking all this time.

this particular location is not even remotely convenient unless you live or are visiting a friend at allure.
i was taking some clients to see the units at allure, they were hungry and mentioned how much they love capriotti's and, lucky for us, there's one within a minute from allure.

service was friendly and the sandwiches were, according to my clients, as good as it gets.
i was also quite impressed...especially with the vegetarian selections.
all good in my book!"}
{"text":"Dude, this place is bomb. Another gem found on Yelp.

I had the Capostromi and the wife had the Bobbi. The bobbie tasted like Thanksgiving dinner. Juicy shredded turkey on a bed of heavenly stuffing and smothered with cranberry sauce. Primo, man... Primo.

I actually liked the Capostromi better. What made the sandwich was the cole slaw topping. Really put it together nicely.

My only complaint is, I wish there were more sandwich options. 

I'll be going back... and SOON!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a sandwich on the way to the park.  Next day I notice the charge has had a $2 tip added to it that I did not authorize.  ( I left a cash tip in the beer money jar)

I called Corporate and got nowhere because this is a franchise store.  At that point I gave up because as much as I like their sandwiches I am never going back."}
{"text":"Ever since my first bite a few years ago, Capriottis has become somewhat of a Vegas trip must-have. After a recovery nap, my friend and I ordered a 9 inch Capastrami (hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and cole slaw) and a 9 inch Bobbie (homemade turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo) to share. The two sandwiches came out to about $18, including a $3 delivery charge (which is likely much less than what a taxi would've cost) . It took about an hour for our sandwiches to arrive (they promised \"an hour or less\" on the phone). 

We initially called the W Sahara branch, but contrary to their listed Yelp information, they don't deliver (someone should fix that, unless they lied to me).

I think the Bobbie is my new favorite. Minus one star because the sandwiches weren't as good as I remember. Maybe it was the one-hour delivery wait? Still, I'll continue to campaign for a Capriottis date every time I find myself in Vegas."}
{"text":"Subs are different and not too bad - only thing that annoyed be was the dirty look the cashier gave for not adding a tip. Seriously? I don't tip counter service at McDonalds either."}
{"text":"And it wasn't the first time I visited this location but the team that works here was really above and beyond. Made us feel welcome from the minute we walked in. Kyle was cooking up sandwiches, and Erin was behind the counter talking with us. We had a fun time and everybody was really nice, and later method GM of the store. Kerrina, she was really nice to you and I could tell everyone really liked to work there and was in good spirits. Definitely will come back here again this morning and oh yeah :-)"}
{"text":"Not happy, got there at open to get a meatball sub, I hope I got yesterday's marinara sauce, I hope they would not serve that crap.  It was horrible.  If that's you standard change it, I wasted my money and will not be back."}
{"text":"Chicken Cheese Steak with onions, pickles, peppers. Good flavor, but short on meat. Fresh soft roll, but it's a lot of bread when it's light on meat. Good news, it's something different than the neighbors (jj), Bad news was 10 minutes later my stomach did a flip from the grease and I spent my evening in the bathroom. ugh
Expensive Sammiches then again we are in North Scottsdale!
Will I try them again? Sure. I'd like to try the Bobbie nexttime around, though I'm not a chain-store fan. I'd rather find the mom & pop shop with real food."}
{"text":"I've stopped in here periodically over the last several years and see a recurring theme. 

On my last visit I wait 20 minutes for two sandwiches. I tried to be patient, thinking that all the customers coming through the door had placed phone orders. Finally had to ask where my food was...the guy who took my order either lost it or tossed it. They took it again and I waited another 10 mins for them to fix it. When it was finally ready I didn't even get a discount, a free drink or comp'd meal...not even a \"we're sorry\".  Not terribly surprised. 

Four stars for the food, 1 star for service, 1 star for cleanliness....averages out to 2 stars."}
{"text":"First time here and ordered the Bobbie, Thanksgiving dinner on a bun (turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo).  Bread was fresh and everything was seasoned nicely.  We got the medium size (12\") and wow, it must have weighed about 2 pounds!  Plenty of food for myself and my hubby.  We were the only ones in the shop at the time, so our order was processed pretty quickly.  I don't know how busy this place gets, but I believe one should phone in one's order to save time.  Something I noticed: the floors were a little bit dirty, not so much to dissuade me from trying a sandwich, but just enough to wonder why it wasn't cleaner, especially when there was time and opportunity to attend to it?  I'll come here again to try a different sandwich....and to see if the floor's cleaner.  :)"}
{"text":"Capriotti's is usually solid and this location is no exception. Very good sandwiches! The Philly Cheesesteak is my favorite. They do it VERY well. The famous Bobby is also great. It's like Thanksgiving on a roll. Their bread is better than any other sub place and the insides of their sandwiches are LEGIT! I think you should probably add sweet peppers AND hot peppers. That's the way this OG likes it anyway. I wish they had fountain drinks, but I get why they don't. I also don't need a GIANT bag of chips, but it's a good choice for a family to share. I get that too. Really, you can't go wrong with Capriotti's. There's something for everyone. We order party platters when we have groups of folks over for a game or something and everyone loves it."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to get grub. Service was good. Menu selection is the typical Capriotti's getup. New location so not very busy. It is right next to a ton of shops and other restaurants. All and all it was a chill vibe."}
{"text":"Had to wait an hour for 2 small sandwiches that I called and ordered ahead....need I say more?"}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed in my visit to Capriotti's this time.  I have been here before and thought it was great.  Today I decided to take an out of state collegue here after I spoke highly of the place.  We got there, and not too many people were there, so we got there just in time.  We ordered our sandwiches. Hers pretty much came out right away, while mine still didn't arrive after 10-15 minutes. I noticed the people that came in after us getting their food.  I decided to check at the counter and make sure they didn't lose my order.  I was told, no, they had a large phone order that came in right before I ordered.  I wasn't sure how this could be accurate considering those after me already received their orders. After 7 more minutes passed my food finally appears and I was told \"ooops, they did lose your order\".  I open it and the sandwich was obviously thrown together.  it had tomatoes on it, that I specifically requested not to have.  It did not have the mayo and pickles I requested and it was very dry (due to no condiments).  I was embarrassed that I bragged about capriotti's and my guest and I experienced this.  We were also late coming back from lunch because of this ordeal."}
{"text":"Well it's not the best sandwich in America as they say but I did enjoy their hot turkey sandwiches! I tried the \"Bobbie\" which is one of their signature subs and it was quite good. I'm not sure if I cared for the stuffing or not as I felt everything else on it was just fine as it is. Everything else I did like such as the homemade turkey and the cranberry sauce.

I also tried one of their cold turkey sandwiches as well on another visit. It definitely was not nearly as good as the \"Bobbie\" and immediately knew that I should have gotten that instead. This restaurant does benefit from its location being right in Old Town Scottsdale and I hope they continue to do well."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Caps. I don't think i've ever had a bad sandwich from this place. And the fact that they make your sandwich to order there is no getting cold or \"old\" food. 

This location was decent service was good and the food came out quickly. My cheesesteak sandwich came out piping hot and full of flavor. Everything was melded together perfectly with the peppers, onions, meat, cheese and mushrooms.  Wasn't very busy so it was nice and quiet and we were able to relax and enjoy our lunch!

if you've never been here before try the Bobbie!"}
{"text":"Started out good me and my lady ordered the Veggie Burger but never got it. Walked in when it wasn't busy during our 25 min stay customers started coming in after us and those same customers left before us. No one notified us about our food until I went to the counter to ask for my refund"}
{"text":"So bummed.  Went and got a turkey sand.  I said no onion no mayo. The lady asked me if I wanted mustard and oil and vinegar.  I said yes.  My sandwich is drier than dirt!   I guess I will eat it for dinner"}
{"text":"The staff here was so courteous and very nice! Great sandwiches when it's a tad bit cold outside...."}
{"text":"The bobby with extra onions (Even though it doesn't come with onions) is the best sandwich hands down In Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever visited any Capriottis location here in the Valley or San Diego that hasn't been 100% stellar. Quick, polite, delicious. I'm never going to stray again from Capriottis - I'll go hungry before I go to another sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Forget the alcohol, I would come to Vegas just for THE CAPASTRAMI and THE BOBBIE."}
{"text":"I had to spend a lot of time in this area during the summer months, so I grabbed food here pretty often despite having another location a lot closer to home that I prefer.
 
This location had a persistent and on-going ROACH problem!!! 

I've seen multiple roaches in the bathroom... eek!! I was told by a member of management they were \"water bugs\" and nothing to worry about. Riiiight. I don't know about you, but when I see a pile of roaches writhing around in the corner of a bathroom I don't exactly feel particularly enthused about what's going on in the kitchen.

Then the owner dude who wears a baseball cap was extremely condescending and hostile towards his own employees, which didn't exactly encourage me to spend my money at his business, either, which is too bad as the employees themselves were always pleasant enough.... unfortunately, on top of everything else, my boyfriend has found a bone in almost each and every single one of his Bobbies that we'd ordered. Being REAL turkey it's understandable to find a bone every once in awhile, but he found full on VERTEBREA. How do you miss that?! 

I like the food at Capriotti's a lot more than most sub shops, and the employees at this location were always pleasant enough, but the owner and the cleanliness of this place made me take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches.  I've been here a few times now and every time, the sandwiches are fresh and filling.  This is probably my favorite sandwich shop in town. The service is great and all of the staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Once in a while we have a hankering for a good Sub; there's nothing like biting into a fluffy, soft, chewy roll upon which your mouth hits payload with a good, thick, hearty deli meat mixed with the crunch of vegetables....it's a mush of satisfying flavors swirling around that's instantly gratifying....(of which we're devout followers...)

Capriotti's is a bit of that East Coast shop, reminiscent of your favorite local neighborhood deli.  A sense of nostalgia sweeps over you upon entering the doors; the black and white checker tiled floors, kids in white aprons running between chaos and order; from the front counter where you order to the back counter with the flat top griddle where all the magic happens, it's a quintessential universal memory.....an American Classic.

Capriotti's has been on several, 'Best Sub Sandwich' lists, with 'The Bobbie' being it's most popular, (it's even made it into Urban Dictionary)....It's definitely earned it's recognition and is worth trying out for yourselves!!!

And can I say, there's something about getting that sandwich over the counter, wrapped in it's white butcher paper, thick and weighty like handling a mighty sword; a sense of power  rushes over you as you toss your meaty sandwich up in the air like a baton.....it's like.....Deli Power!!!!!

We have two favorite sandwiches that we always get, (by now if you've read our post, you know that once we like something, that's pretty much all we're gonna get..).  Adventurous? Nope. Consistent? Yes..

The Capastrami: hot Pastrami sandwich with Swiss, Russian Salad Dressing and the Cole Slaw is fantastic; it's that blend of piping hot pastrami, with the creamy, crunch of tangy Cole Slaw and Russian Dressing that is just indescribably delicious!!!! 

I love the entire process of eating a Capriotti's Sub; unwrapping the white butcher paper and rolling the sandwich out, with big, aromatic wafts filling your senses, it make you ravenous for all that is between the hoagie roll!
This sandwich does not last long on the plate, you find yourself devouring it within seconds!  It is hands down, one of the Best Subs Sandwiches I have ever had...

The other sandwich, of course, is The Bobbie: Home made roasted Turkey with Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing, Provolone and Mayo.  It's exactly the sandwich that all you guys make the day after Thanksgiving!!!

Now we like the Bobbie hot, (I know I know, it's supposed to be cold- but we like the stuffing and turkey warm for some reason).  Cold stuffing isn't appealing......

But it's truly a comfort food dish, and the Turkey is excellent, especially since it's home made!! You must try this place, it will satisfy your Sub craving!!

{"text":"It was great, I had the Capastrami, my boyfriend had the Bobbie. The only thing I didn't like about his sandwich was that it was served cold, and thinking of stuffing, turkey, and cranberry sauce, you think *warm food* so it didn't meet the hype in my opinion. The capastrami was great though!"}
{"text":"Submitted order online ahead of time was ready when I got there. Friendly staff.  Food is always good.   Hey even had some brownie samples at the counter."}
{"text":"Absolutely TERRIBLE service... the food normally comes out alright but I have never experienced a worst customer service experience. And it was from the owner non the less. I went in for my sandwich three times and they were not finished each time. They took about 30 to 40 min to make 1 9in. Sub. And then the owner walked over to my job next door and right in front of me dropped the sandwich on the counter. Didn't even say your welcome. Save yourself the money! A five dollar footling from subway is more worth it."}
{"text":"I needed a pastrami sandwich.  I first went to Quinzo's to learn they no longer have pastrami on their menu.  So luckily I have an app on my G1 phone and typed in pastrami and this place came up.  Before I walked in an employee who was outside on a break greeted me.  Inside the other staff were very friendly and patient.  I seem to breakdown when it comes to ordering my food.  So I ordered: a small pastrami on a roll with extra mustard, and swiss cheese.  They only carry white bread.  The meat wasn't that great.  It wasn't great quality for the price.  They have specialty sodas for $2.19.  I got root beer which was pretty tasty.  Because of the customer service, If I'm ever in the area again,  might stop back to try something different."}
{"text":"4.5/5

This is a pretty new Capriotti's. Friendly staff and great sandwiches. You can call ahead and order, order on the Cap ap, or order online. Great location, clean restaurant, and Wise Chips:)"}
{"text":"Best subs around and everyone here is always so nice. I order online and I'm in and out with ease"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for a good sandwich. And this place fits my needs.

Online ordering to make it quick and fast, just my type of place. Easy to find, and the employees are extremely friendly. 

Love how family oriented this store is. I always see them doing something for the community. Taking donations, food ones or money and helping out local charity's. I love to support company's that help out those in need, it's always good to give back. Karma is grand. 

My favorite so far is the Italian. The seasonings and blend of oil, vinegar and sauces just melt together to crest a rich base for the sandwiches. The fresh baked in store bread is crunchy and soft inside. They really don't lack on filling the sandwich up either.. Tons of meat. About twice, almost three times as much as subway gives. Yum! Tastes so fresh."}
{"text":"Best Philly Cheesesteak in Vegas.  The bread is fantastic and made from scratch.  You can't really go wrong with ANY sandwich here.  Just GO!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I died and went to heaven.... I went to go visit my cousin in Vegas and we were looking up sandwich places on yelp when this place popped up. 

The Bobbie is quite possible the best thing I've ever had in my life. We ordered 2 large sandwiches and one medium for a total of $30...not too bad (don't worry, we ordered for more than ourselves...maybe)!! It could have lasted us the whole weekend, but these babies are so good you'll eat them even if your full.

The Bobbie is this little piece of cloud heaven with turkey, cranberries and stuffy. It's like having Thanksgiving dinner tossed into a delightful little miracle. :)

The tuna sandwich is pretty good and they're open pretty late (probably because the strip is 4 minutes away). This place was so good, I'd even considering moving to Vegas....haha."}
{"text":"Good sangwich! Not a big fan of their bread. And to me, the bread makes or breaks the Sammy. But, their offerings wery different and various. I'd would definitely go back to try some of their specialties."}
{"text":"Shared a foot-long Capastrami® (Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and cole slaw), with my husband.... it was TO DIE FOR!! I haven't had a pastrami sandwich that taste like that since I was back in New Jersey and had a pastrami on rye with coleslaw from a Jewish Deli. It was amazing! It was lacking the rye bread, but haven't had pastrami with coleslaw in ages and I love!d it!! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great selection of vegetarian sandwiches, plus they'll make regular sandwiches for you with vegetarian meat. Heaven on a hoagie."}
{"text":"I was told this place was very good, and so I already had high expectations coming in. 

Boy, it wasn't as good as I hoped and thought it would be. 

I ordered an italian with hot peppers. Don't get me wrong, it was good. It just wasn't \"great\". The sandwhich had a lot of peppes. Very hot. But that's the way I like it.

Also, it was way overpriced. 

I also tried their turkey sandwhich. It was alright. A lot of bread. 

Everything is purchased seperatley. Chips, drinks,e tc. No \"meals\". 

The people were friendly. I'd rather go to Potbelly Sandwhich."}
{"text":"Bobbie, Italian, and Grilled steak & cheese with peppers ... all 3 awesome.
ordered 3 x 20 inch sandwiches to feed 7 ... was excellent.

Service is always quick and nice."}
{"text":"First time in this new location and the guy at the register who took my order was super nice! It's just a good feeling having someone being kind, respectful, and personable. If I owned my own company I would have offered him a job on the spot. I didn't catch his name in person but I'm assuming his name is the same as the one printed on the receipt for my sandwich. Give Shaquille a raise! Will be back"}
{"text":"I waited half an hour for a med steak sandwich and they did not even git my order right. How can you mess up a steak and lettuce sandwich. Employyes are walking dead, they are so timid. Never going back to this place."}
{"text":"In a town with plenty of expensive meal options, this sandwich shop is a great more reasonably priced alternative for a quick meal before heading out for the night.  There are several fresh and high quality sandwiches to choose from.  Their capastrami sandwich is one of my favorites.  It is piled high with hot pastrami, cheese, and russian cole slaw.  Their cheesesteak sandwich is also one of my favorites.  The steak is well seasoned and the bread is always fresh.  Their Turkey Bobby sandwich is also really good with fresh turkey and cranberry sauce.  This place is definately one of my regular stops when in Vegas."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for their amazing sandwhiches I would be really inclined to leave them a big fat zero for their HORRIBLE customer service. 

The service was bad from the minite we walked in. From the guy yelling (to the back) \"2 customers up front\" instead of a polite \"hello, welcome to capriottis someone will be with you soon\" (since he clearly didn't want to get up and help us) to the SUPER snotty girl behind the counter who looked at us like we were stupid when we asked for a cup for water. She replied with \"oh we don't have anymore\". Worst part she didn't offer any other solution or apology, she just said we are out PERIOD, gave us the \"your dumb\" look and giggled as we turned to the fridge with drinks since we had to now purchase a water bottle now since they were not able to ensure they had sufficient supplies to meet the needs of their customers. 

Seriously one of the WORST experiences I have ever had. I understand restaurants run out of items at no fault of their own but the need to laugh and be rude is unacceptable. Definitely won't mind driving 10 min to the next Cappriottis to enjoy their great sandwiches minus the HORRIBLE service."}
{"text":"I am in LOVE with the Bobbie. It is my new favorite sandwich in the world and I crave it all the time!

Oh wait, I am reviewing the place here. Umm, this location is nice and clean and quite and service was good. They made the sandwiches well and quite quickly.

Only sandwiches I order here is the bobbie (a new discovery for me but will be all i get from now on!) and the cheesesteak which I usually order as a mushroom cheesesteak and sometimes add peppers and ketchup. Yum! Great hot sandwich.

There are so many locations around Vegas, I love it."}
{"text":"I placed an order online, they received all my info. I've been calling and calling for an hour now, hoping to cancel my order because I was farther from the destination than I imagined, but I couldn't get a hold of that place. It kept making a beep beep noise and then when Id hang up, it said that the call had failed. I tried the same number on three other phones and it continued to say that the call failed. If I wanna cancel my order, I should and they should be able to answer. If I'm charged for the food I did not receive, I expect a refund."}
{"text":"Home of the Bobbie-basically a Thanksgiving dinner on a roll so that's turkey, cranberry and stuffing, mayo if you want it.  The sandwich's are huge and filling, good to share. 

Other good ones are the Capistrami and the Eggplant parmesan!  Wonderful! Yum!"}
{"text":"I went into this location and was disappointed to see they no longer honor \"Belly\".  I had been saving points and have 105 ready to use.  Lost all of them now that they no longer are part of the Belly program.  However they still show up on Belly as a location.  

Will I stop coming here? Probably not.  The sandwiches are good. Expensive but good.  The 20 visits required to get a free medium sandwich (8-9 dollar value) was high."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, looked great when I opened it because there were two pieces of meat on the side to make it look fat. There were only 3 pieces of meat on the medium italian. Cmon."}
{"text":"Absolute worst!   Pre ordered days before and nothing was ready when we arrived to pick up the order for a group of people of approximately (50).. Ashley Morris (Corporate Capriotti's was notified with no response) the local management also could care less!! Very happy to take your money though... Never Again!!!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in town!!! Ordered the Cole Turkey - turkey breast, cole slaw and russian dressing on soft, fresh rolls.  Coworkers got a bobbie, a cheesesteak and an Italian and they raved about them too. The small is huge - for a small eater, you can split it into two meals and be stuffed after each half.

Every town in America should have a Capriotti's!"}
{"text":"I'm not too sure about why there are so many 5 star reviews about this place.  Yep, the sandwich is decent, and is definitely worth the money, however, this is far from the best hoagie or sub I've had.

I got the 20 inch Turkey sub.  For 12.99 that's a phenomenal deal.  You definitely get the value for your money.

However, when you break down each of the components, the sandwich itself is just average.  The turkey wasn't sliced turkey, but instead kind of like the same chopped up consistency you would find in a cheesesteak.  I have no issues with that, but the turkey was a bit dry.  

The bread is a very soft bread, with no crust whatsoever.  I'm spoiled by the great bread from the Northeast, where it has a nice crust on the outside and very chewy on the inside.  The bread here is still good, but I wouldn't call this a hoagie.

All in all, the sandwich itself is really average; it's the value that you get for your money that drives it up to 4 stars for my review.  It's a decent substitute, but no match for a real hoagie."}
{"text":"My all time favorite is the Slaw Be Joe (roast beef, slaw..) OMG.. do DELISH!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner tonight. This store is different from the rest as it is a flagship store and they are making changes to their menu and the storefronts. This store is much larger than the usual ones and has plenty of room for dining inside. If you order your food to eat there they give you a number and bring the food to you. They also serve your food on real dishes with actual silverware. The service was great and so was the staff. This store also offered soups and freshly made salads in addition to the usual yummy sandwiches. I ordered from the new Capture 2 menu which is one half a sandwich and either a salad or bowl of soup. I got the Bobbie and BBQ Chicken Salad. I've had the Bobbie many times before and it was delicious as usual. I had never had the salad before but it was absolutely delicious and I will definitely order it again. Just enough food to fill me up. We also tried a sample of the chicken soup which was yummy too. I can't wait to come back here and also for the other Capriotti's to follow suit like this one."}
{"text":"Staff not friendly and when I got back to my hotel I realized roast beef was so dry that the meat looked old and I couldn't even eat my 13$ sandwich."}
{"text":"Yummy addition to our neighborhood. An upscale sandwich shop was badly needed. I had the Bobbie, their most popular sammy. Love the cranberry sauce and stuffing!! Just like you'd make at home. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Really tasty subs: as first timers, we stuck with the capastrami and the bobbie, the 2 most yelped about. 

2 Mediums (at 12\" each) ended up to be about 7\" too long for the 4 of us lightweights!  (Then again, we were kind of pacing ourselves for our impending M-fest later in the day.)

The capastrami was everyone's fave but I thought the bobbie was right up there. the turkey was really moist and delicious. a perfect one handed thanksgiving."}
{"text":"There Philly is hands down the best I've ever had. Staff here is awesome as well. Tyler and Jordan are always super great. Love this place."}
{"text":"My friends and I were in a pinch to grab food and someone mentioned Capriottis, so I thought why not.

The location was far away from the strip in a street lot location.

Once inside, the seating area was luckily able to hold a party of 11.

The menu selection is quite small so I ordered the Slobby Joe (roast beef, cole slaw, regular bread roll) this sandwich  mainly consisted of cole slaw but after digging an inch of all that mayo drenched cabbage the roast beef had a great taste

After reading more views I realize that the choice of sandwich was probably a poor one and should've ordered the Bobbie or the turkey dinner sandwich"}
{"text":"This place is so comical in a very, very sad way. The quality of the employees here are so substandard, that I feel like I am walking into a third world country when I step inside. Actually I take that back-- a third world country would blow this place out of the water. 
  
  On one of my visits, I am the only person in the store for a couple of minutes with no one behind the counter. Some girl finally comes out of the bathroom, very obviously without washing her hands, and demands if I was here to make an order. Well as a matter of fact I was. I was also expecting my order to be completely wrong, taste like utter sadness, and I was not disappointed! 
  
  The clue was obviously that I had to make my order by repeating everything I wanted (a large order of one medium sandwich) about 5 to 6 times to someone who was just grasping what the concept of communication was. 
  
  They cook your food in the back so they can do some awful shady things to it, because it always tastes so nasty and soggy without fail. Why this place hasn't been shut down and permanently condemned by any health inspector is beyond me. 
  
  Until then it's a nice place to come visit to make me thankful for the food I have in my fridge. My sandwich is now soggy AND cold after writing this review so I'm just going to throw it in the trash. I have a legitimate suspicion that I just avoided potentially fatal food poisoning."}
{"text":"I can appreciate a sandwich shop that has vegan options. Best tofurkey sandwiches. It packs a punch + service is awesome. They gave me a free foot long upgrade for returning. A+ service!"}
{"text":"Will NOT be going back to this location. I was a regular at Capriotti's in Wilmington and Dover back East. This location should have their franchise ripped. Next to NO meat on my cheesesteak. My wife's Bobbie had almost no stuffing and waaaaay too much cranberry sauce. The portion size and taste in comparison to original locations is a joke. Save your money, go get a burger if you're in Vegas, sub shops out here just don't compare. Their subs look NOTHING like the pictures."}
{"text":"I always go to Capriotti's not this location and I will never go to this one again here's why. While taking my order the guy was nice but after that it was chaos. We waited almost 30 minutes for two small sandwiches not only that the lady when I asked if they were done gave me this attitude like I was bothering her. Then she tells me that there almost done with one of my sandwiches I look over and the girl is smacking her gum all over where she is making my sandwich. You are never supposed to chew gum while working next to food her spit could get into my food I'm never going back"}
{"text":"Great sandwich place to try out when in Vegas. I've tried the Italian and the Roast Beef, both were outstanding. Made me feel much better after a night of drinking, gave me the energy to fight the 4 hours of traffic back to LA.

Will be back again...

Also try Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood, another great sandwich shop."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying \"The Bobbie\". I must admit not sure why I waited so long but talk about turkey delicious! Sub always starts with the bread alway felt Capriotti does it right freshly baked each and nice crusty bread on outside moist on the inside. I think what makes great sub is each component stands out by itself. The Bobbie has it! The shredded turkey meat combination of dark and white meat. The stuffing that could do scoop nice and warm by itself. The cranberry sauce perfect accent not overkill the flavors. It nice sweet so just the right amount perfect way top off sandwich from turkey heaven. Yelp check-in get free large drink! So between \"The Bobbie\", bag of jalapeno chips, and free check-in soda. It best lunch can have under $10! =))"}
{"text":"This locations is very hard to get to deliver. I've called 3 times in the last 2 weeks to have a sandwich delivered and every time I get an excuse. \"We aren't going to take any more deliveries today\" \"our delivery is booked for the rest of the day\" or \"we stop delivering at 12pm\" what's the point of having a sign on the front saying \"we deliver\" but never can? I've called at different times, just to see if it's any slower or if they can deliver a block away to work.. The customer service isn't all that great at this location."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop. My husband got the sub and I ordered a salad.  We were both very impressed with the taste and quality of the food.  Highly recommend for a quick place to eat on the way out of Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Usually I eat a sandwich cause I'm hungry and it sounds good.  Usually it is....good that is.  This place has amazing sandwiches.  Whatever sandwich you get be sure to get the sweet peppers....yum !  Great to take a break from Christmas!  And they have REAL vegetarian options.  Good music, great staff.  Couple bucks more than subway and worth it!  Only downer....no avocado!!"}
{"text":"My first time there and it was great I had a Italian med and it was really good way better than the other place with the bagged meat any very friendly staff and I love the chip. And yes I will be back"}
{"text":"I hate to give any capriottis one star and maybe my review is outdated (because it wasnt listed last time i looked) but man... the lunch crew that I experienced during my lunch back in April was horrrrrrible....   I had to walk out of the restaurant or I would have exploded...   I bought my parents there after much ranting and raving for the first part of their vacation and the guys behind the counter RUINED it....   sounds dramatic...  but I really feel like this could be the worst capriottis in the valley... Unless something has drastically changed I would not feel comfortable sending anyone in there...      There is another on Blue Diamond between Buffalo and Durango.. go there...   much better service..."}
{"text":"Dear Capritotti's,

Your sandwiches are unbelievable and I think I may have to confirm an obsession for The Bobbie and Hot Sausage grinder.  All of the employees that work at this location are super friendly and one is a Red Sox fan.(which completely made my day as I was paying with my red sox credit card)  If you are looking for a great sub with great people making them, hit up Cap's over on Blue Diamond in between Buffalo and Durango."}
{"text":"I was sad to see Schlotzky's go away, but I went in to the new place last night with a few friends before going out to the casino. I was hungry, but didn't want to get stuffed, so I went with the small (9 inch) cheese steak sandwich. It had thinly sliced steak with cheese, mixed peppers, onions and mayo. Oh, man! It was delicious, I ate the whole thing in about two minutes. The veggies were great, and the bread was delicious and able to hold everything together without getting too messy. One of the employees let us know that they are open late (3 am) and will have a liquor license by the end of summer. Great news! I will definitely be back for a medium or large sandwich soon."}
{"text":"Bad. Ass. Sandwiches!
If you're looking for a downright phenomenal sammie, go here now!
Capriotti's has been knocking it out of the park in Vegas for Decades. 
I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great Spot to grab a yummy sandwich before the trip home! Ive had there Bobby Sandwich (famous thanksgiving left overs in a soft baked roll) and their Cole Turkey sandwich. Both were tasty! The coleslaw was a good mix, it provided a slight tanginess to the sandwich. 
Overall, the service was a tad bit slow but they did have a line. They might get confused here and there (they messed up a few orders) but you'll get whats yours and it will be pretty darn tasty. No Earls of sandwichs, but a good spot to grab a sandwich before a long drive =D."}
{"text":"Very unprofessional. 

Note to owner : having at least one adult on duty might prevent any problems you might be having. 

I had a large order to pick up and after waiting for 10 minutes, the girl came out and told me it was already delivered. Why was I waiting then? Why didn't you just tell me the minute I arrived?? 

I was trying to confirm that it was picked up and asked the manager on duty, who was a young kid. She told me she was going to check on it and just disappeared into the back and never returned....

Ummm...are you an employee here because you and the other 3 kids that are sitting in the back on top of the cutting boards are all giggling like this is a joke...

Which, by the way, is a major health code violation. 

I would not recommend this company. I have encountered many similar problems at various other locations. They seem to be run by children."}
{"text":"I don't know how they can mess up an order that's online. It's clearly written in black and white. Only when I arrived did they realize. What was odd is that I didn't even tell them. They realized JUST AS I WALKED IN. But when I asked what they do with the mistakes, suddenly they got really quiet and eventually sputtered and mumbled several answers. Knowing kids, I wouldn't be surprised if they were messing up on purpose so they could eat the mistakes themself. It was just too strange that he didn't realize he made the wrong sandwich until I arrived and without me even saying anything. After reading other reviews, it seems like a trend because I'm not the only one. I really wouldn't care because not my problem except...this wasn't for me. I was picking up for someoneand they were waiting...Lame. I would not recommend this location until they fix this problem."}
{"text":"Placed an order for work online. Ordered 3 sandwiches and the only special request was to cut the large sandwich in to 4 pieces instead of the standard 3. The order was supposed to be ready by 12:22 PM, 20 minutes from the time I ordered.
I arrived to pick up my order at 12:30pm and it still wasn't ready. They were still making the philly steak. I waited another 10 minutes for my order. Meanwhile two more people came in and stood near the counter to place an order and we're never acknowledged while I was there.
The staff were nice but unorganized or understaffed for a lunch shift.
The large sandwich was only cut in half, and the Capastrami was very salty."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because they got 1 sandwich right. Then they screwed up what he did have down. And while I waited three of them stood behind the counter yelling about the cinematic greatness of the movie Scarface, and other misc garbage. Meanwhile, I continued to wait over 10 minutes for 3 sandwiches, while no other customers were there, and they messed up 2 of the 3 sandwiches. Tried calling numerous times and just a busy signal."}
{"text":"I would never go back here again. They used to be me and my husband's favorite. Or treat to ourselves and they were delicious and the quality was like nothing we have ever tried. It was even a good selling point in when we looked at our apartment because it was walking distance. lol. I have no idea when, or how it happened but I will never go back. We got sandwiches for the whole family. All the same type, and every aspect about them were nasty. The bread was stale. The turkey was like TUNA, and when I called and told the lady she laughed and said that she heard that a few times. Ummm I only have gotten the same sandwich here, the Cole Turkey and I have NEVER thought that it was anything like tuna at all. The coleslaw was flavorless and dry, and the dressing was nonexistent, making it the worst food I have eaten in Vegas. I emailed on the day it happened and never got a response. I called and talked to someone and she said that I had to have a receipt for her to make anything up. Which is fine, believe me I wasn't letting her know how crappy her food was to get more crappy food. Just thought that she would like to know that the quality of the food was lousy and that I would never, ever return. Bad food, bad service, bad deal for your money. I would recommend you travel over to Jersey Mike's or hell even Subway, you would get a much better sandwich."}
{"text":"This morning I went in to pick up my sandwich order and I was refilling my soda with ice and added about half of it with soda. I get a sandwich every day there which is $70 aweek and refill and allw always pay for it. This guy told me to stop because it wasn't free and I told him I knew that and intended to pay when I got my order.He got all up in my face and said there were a lot of thieves there. I don't know if he was the owner or just a manager but thanks to him I now have to fin
d a new Cappriottis to get my food. All the employees that work there are great but he embarrassed me so much that that I can't go back. He needs to get some customer service training and think before he accuses someone of stealing."}
{"text":"New location in Town Square, across from the movie theater. Sandwiches are great just like any other Capriotti's locations and the employees are fast, efficient and friendly. If you've never been to a Capriotti's before, I would really recommend the Bobbie or the Capastrami...which are my favorites. It was hot outside and Capriotti's seemed to have their AC turned up much higher than other stores that day. Loved it since it was really refreshing...also caused me to stay there longer than I had planned!"}
{"text":"The employees had the phone off... I drove down there and 4 other people said the same thing. We had all be trying to call for the last hour. Not cool. Not a good way to do business."}
{"text":"By far the best sandwich place in Vegas 
. This is my go to place for lunch. I recommend the Italian.  No other place compares"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Capriottis.  First time I tried it was in Reno, NV.

This is GREAT hangover food. It's healthy, filling and the bread helps soak up the alcohol. ;)  But! Be sure to order with with the sweet peppers and not the hot peppers if you are nursing a hangover.

I get the turkey sandwich, which has shredded, fresh, roasted turkey, not that sodium-ladened garbage they sell at the grocery store.

This is my Go To hangover place in Vegas. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Friendly service, large portions, soft bread, tasty sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"Sehr lecker, vor allem das thanksgiving sandwich. Sehr freundlich und sehr beliebt bei locals"}
{"text":"Effin great sandwich place!! I'm plain so the homemade turkey is all I want but the service is fast and the people know me by name now!! No more subways!!"}
{"text":"stopped by this place while passing las vegas, wanted a quick sandwich so i could get back on the road. ordered a cold, turkey sub... took an HOUR for them to make it. i don't know what they were doing back there, there was other people in the joint but this was just ridiculous. sandwich was okay but honestly not that great wouldn't come here again even if i lived down the street."}
{"text":"Our store orders lunch for us every Saturday and every Saturday we hope majority rules to order lunch from here because their sandwiches are awesome! Ate their pastrami sandwich and haven't gotten tired of our yet."}
{"text":"This Capriotti's seemed to take forever to make my sandwich. Usually when I order from Capriotti's, service is quick and easy and I am in and out of the restaurant fast. For some reason, there was some difficulty in making the Bobbie sandwich that I ordered this time around."}
{"text":"I went here a few times with a friend of mine. He immediately became a big fan... for me... my grandma did much better sandwiches... nothing special about the place. The place looks worn... the food is below avg (IMHO).. I mean.. the bread is bad! but if you've heard of it, you should give it a try. Good luck!"}
{"text":"I went here the day i found out i had vertigo. true story. it's now part of my history. 

i woke up and instantly thought 'did i get drunk last night and i dont remember?'

not the case, i had to have my mom pick me up and if i remember correctly i had to scoot down the 3 flights of apartment stairs so that i wouldn't fall. if only someone recorded that and put it on youtube...

anywho, after the dr. said it was vertigo causing my issues, i got to go home but i was hungry and wanted a sandwich. all of the nurses said to go here. so my mom drove me and bought me lunch. :) 

the turkey is some of the best i have had!! they seriously packed the sandwich so thick with layers of divine turkey. they had a sandwich related to thanksgiving and i need to try it, and lots of goodies from the east coast that we don't typically see in az. i will totes be back."}
{"text":"had a terrible experience and the Sahara location (resulting in a refund and no sandwhichs) but I was still craving caps. drove the extra miles to come to this one and it was the experience I was looking for. I even told them what had happened and they had my back. made my order perfectly and didn't try to convince me a medium sandwhich was the same size as a small ( screw Sahara location). i will be returning here, great service. thanks guys!"}
{"text":"been going to this caps for about 2 years now and I'm tripping out how this place has gone down hill tonight. I ordered a medium sub and a small sub. when they handed me my order something seemed off so I pulled the sandwhichs out and they were almost identical In size. if you press the ends of the paper down they were identical in size! I asked the kid working if it was a medium and he said he wasn't sure so he asked the the shift manager in back who said it was (he didn't come the front to look though). I asked him to come up and he looked at me and said he made it personally lol and that they don't go by length it literally says on the menu a small is 9\" and a medium is 12\"...... he wouldn't budge so I just asked for a refund. drove to another caps and got what I ordered without the hassle of having to beg for what I ordered. don't forget this location was closed down and on dirty dining a couple weeks ago. probably dodged a food poisoning bullet."}
{"text":"It's pretty exciting when you go into a sub shop and they offer vegetarian cheese \"steak\" sandwich.   I've never had a cheese steak sandwich, so as I was driving back to the office, with my sandwich in tow, I kept peeking in the bag thinking, \"Is this real?\" Yes It was, and it was fantastic!  I was expecting a greasy cheesy mess, but that wasn't the case at all. The \"meat\" and peppers were perfectly cooked to order and topped with real cheese, not cheese whiz. I had them add mushrooms, which was a solid choice, well worth the extra buck.  The bread was very soft inside with a little crunch to crust, similar to Italian bread.  Needless to say, I enjoyed every bite of my $10 sandwich.  The best part may have been seeing my co-workers jaws drop at the sight of me eating \"meat\"."}
{"text":"sandwiches here are incredible.  the bobbie is my favorite and the hot italian is a close second.  my fiancee is vegetarian and they have tons of vege-meats in delicious sandwiches."}
{"text":"Found this one on yelp while checking out a cool playground right in the middle of Las Vegas Town Square... It was just exactly what we were craving and delicious! We had a chicken cheese steak, cran slam club, and homemade Turkey sub. I think this chain is coming to California side soon if not already so we are excited about that! We will be back!"}
{"text":"We always get the chicken philly which has never disappointed us. Most recently I called in an order since I was taking food to my husband on his lunch break. Usually I'm not in much of a hurry but being that it was 110 degrees that day and I had my 1 year old son I was looking to run in and out. When I arrived 15 minutes after placing my order, as told, they hadn't even started my sandwich (there was one customer in the restaurant) I waited another 10 minutes in the store with my car running so I didn't have to wait for it to cool down for my son. We love the sandwiches but I hope that they learn to quote better wait times or at least be apologetic for the error. This is the first issue I've had and I hope it doesn't happen again."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype, it's a sequel!

I'll give it 5 stars for the creativity of the infamous \"Bobbi sandwich\"
But the taste, 2 stars at best. Stuffing, cranberry sauce and turkey. Tasteless, tasteless & tasteless.

This place can't touch Jimmy's famous heros of brooklyn. Can't touch this."}
{"text":"The girls that work are so nice! Service is always quick! 

I love me a good Bobbie and Capistrami but they are high in the calories so I went for the Chic ken Cheesesteak. Don't judge. It's a better alternative, I'm not starving myself in the name of food. LOL! Yum! I was sad and hesitant to go beyond what I love at Cap's but now I have a new favorite. Order this...do it! And do it with both hot and sweet peppers! The hot ones add just a bit of a kick!"}
{"text":"I was actually surprised at the quality of the sandwiches here...I got the Italian. I've had the Bobbie before (at the Vegas location) Very consistent. Great service. Much better than most chain restaurants...I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Get the Bobby. The end.

Okay, maybe I'll expand just a little bit. Capriotti's is a great lunch spot if you're working or going to school in Tempe. They're fast, friendly, and above all - delicious.

I'd heard about the Bobby, and I was a little hesitant. I mean, a sandwich with stuffing, turkey, gravy, and cranberry sauce? But everybody told me it was delicious, so I gave it a shot. And you know what? They were totally right."}
{"text":"Always a great cheesesteak.  Quick friendly service.  My wife loves the Bobbi.  For her 4 meals in the large, for me 2.  Love this place."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is great each and every time. Cheesesteak, Bobbie, and Cole turkey are my favorites. This location is always fast even though it's small and gets busy. Customer Service is quick and correct. No issues and will return again."}
{"text":"Their door says they close at 8 PM however door is locked at 7: 6725 s eastern #850PM and maybe they stop answering their calls for a pick up for a cold sandwich around that time too... :/ rthe and kj and I"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch before work. Not too many people when I got there. We were greeted when we entered. The cashier Paul was inviting and as usual we couldn't make our minds up! Lol. We normally get theBobby, but we wanted something a little different since we just had holiday after holiday of turkey and stuffing. He offered help and suggestions. 

My boyfriend and I ordered a large Chicken Cheese Steak. His side plain with cheese and chicken. My side chicken, cheese and mushroom. Also I ordered a bowl of chicken noodle soup. The sandwich itself was a little bland for my taste. It needed a little something, something. The chicken noodle soup wasn't too bad. If you do opt for chips, be sure to try the Honey BBQ chips to go along with your sandwich. 

Food was out real quick and service was great! 
I'll have to try something different next time but normally the Bobby is always great when we do get it!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want to grab a quick bite, but it's hard to stomach the high prices for subpar food (I'm looking at you, Carnegie!).  And if you're like me, you're not quite sure where to go, either, since you're not a local.  Enter yelp.  Yelp results showed Capriotti's was rated highly and priced juuust right.

I got the \"small\" capastrami - pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw with russian dressing -- delicious.  It's no Langer's pastrami sandwich (in L.A.), but it was pretty good.  My friend got the slaw be joe sandwich - roast beef, cole slaw, russian dressing.  He didn't like it as much as the pastrami, so I definitely recommend the capastrami over it.  

I would definitely come back.  The funny thing is, I thought Capriotti's was a sandwich franchise in Vegas only (they have multiple shops within a 5 mile radius).  Turns out there's one in LA (Beverly Hills), so I drove 4 hours to \"discover\" a sandwich shop that's been here all along. ;)"}
{"text":"I received my delivery and of course the sandwiches were all wrong. Tried to contact store, phone rang no less than 30 times then someone picked up only to hang up on me immediately. This is the last time I will buy from this Capriotti's location."}
{"text":"Seriously?
My cheesesteak had barely any meat inside. It was a pathetic combination of meat to bread. Are you that incompetent that you can't even compile a correct sandwich together. They must have been in a rush. THE QUALITY IS LACKING.
What a shame... I thought I lucked out having it so close to my house. I'll stick to the one on paradise and harmon."}
{"text":"I called Maya Swanson from Capriottis' corporate office to make complaint of this restaurant at this location. This was first time coming to this one at this location. I was giving her complaint about my order being messed up by a new guy she says just started. Then someone in the back slammed an item down just because this new guy didn't tell me if a cheaper order. I was distraught by that. And apologized and hopefully have forward my complaint to this location. She also said she will send me an app of something to make up for that complaint, but I never yet seen it and I wrote her on it and now she is not responding anymore. Wow, this service is weird!"}
{"text":"I called to place my order, like the company offers!! and I could hear the lady on the other side of the phone crystal clear. Not a single bit of distortion, or the sound of bad reception, the lady on the other side says sorry I can't hear you call me back when you have better reception bye, and hangs up on me!! I had 100% reception!!!! Also, I'm not a rocket scientist but I'm pretty sure if I have crystal clear reception on my end then you are going to be able to hear me just fine on the other end as well. I walk into the shop expecting to see a line out the door, because that would be the only reason, and good reasoning that I could see for her to hang up on me as quickly as she did. NOPE THERE WAS NOT EVEN A SINGLE PERSON IN LINE!!! Then she was the only lady at the store so I asked the guy who was a manager who was at the register, is that the only lady here right now? he said yes, that's the DM, I was freakin appalled!!! What I'm getting at is this, you don't ever hang up on someone in the flash of an eye like she did with out giving it a second, I mean absolutely worst customer service experience I've had in a long time. Then the manager went into the back to explain to her that the people she, the DM, SO rudely hung up on, we're now here in the front and very displeased with her customer service she just provided. She didn't even bother to come out and show her face, probably because she was too embarrassed that the people she just hung up on we're now there. So she never came out, however the manager of the store, a young African American male, he was top notch on the customer service he apologized and said he was very sorry, he even offered us a bag of chips on him because he felt so bad for her bad service she just provided us with. This is a bad DM and she needs to be retrained on customer service immediately!! I am in direct face to face sales on a daily, so I know what a good representation of a company looks like and I very easily know what a bad one looks like and his was one of the worst I've seen in a while. I sincerely hope the GM will take note of this and take proper action."}
{"text":"I always make a point to visit this restaurant when I come back into town, but I normally visit a different location. That said, I will not return to this location again.

I wasn't greeted for several minutes and after many attempts at making eye contact with any of the 5 employees behind the counter. After I ordered, I walked over to the register to pay (no one else is in front of me at this point). The guy behind the register didn't say a word but looked at me and walked back, not to return for about 5 minutes. Another customer was behind me and equally confused - we decided we were supposed to wait until our food was ready to pay. Eventually the guy came back and I got my food a few minutes later. Overall, it was an awkward and annoying experience that I have never had at any other location. 

The only reason I gave this location 2 stars was the food itself. They did get it right and it was amazing as usual. Get the slaw-be-joe and thank me later."}
{"text":"The reason why I am giving this place two stars instead of two is because their sandwiches are good but they are very expensive. I spent time in CA and in the East Coast and I am not expecting east coast dely quality but the price does not really match the quality. They are greedy and charge too much,, they should lower their prices across the board and of course they make their most money off of their drinks. In fact, they charge restaurant prices so do no think it is cheap. Their Philly Cheese Steak  is the best but I was kind of disappointed in their pastrami.  If you want those in a 12\", WITHOUT any drinks or chips, you are going to pay $10! 

/I would have given it a 1 star honestly but I felt like thier food is not bad, again it is better than Subway, at least they do not heat it in a microwave. In LA and NYC you can find good deli and they charge something reasonable like $8. The portions will be the same but the quality will be better. There are way better places you can co in LV for a good sandwich, just hit up one of the casinos. You do not have to gamble. I wanted to give this place a shot because it is next to my house but I am not coming. Also, sometimes it is very hard ot place an order and pick it up, your phone does not go through, they have problems with htsi. Overall B quality on food but F on prices. I have not tried all of their things because for $10, I can go to the supermarket and get a couple of pieces of steaks. I wanted to write a long review so people are aware of the issues. Do not say I did not warn you. If you are not being served and you are picking up the food, why should I pay you those prices and you expect a tip? Here is a tip, do not be a fool, stay in school. LOL! The ambiance is your typical fast food joint but again they charge eatery prices."}
{"text":"Not much of a sandwich eater myself. I can always make one at home if in the mood. But at the time I wanted something different to eat then the norm. Given my location this place came highly reviewed by Yelp followers and as always I fell sucker!!!
It was ok. nothing like most people claim. Yes turkey and cranberry on any given day other then thanksgiving is a good notion, but Im not that fond of it. Im glad its only once a year and not a daily, weekly course. It was cool. Nothing out of this world. Sorry to say...."}
{"text":"This place is the best sandwich shop in Vegas. I highly recommend \"THE BOBBY\". It's the best sub I have ever eaten. Well! except for that seafood sub I use to get at The Little King, in commercial center, back in the 80's. :)"}
{"text":"WOW!  I have never ate here before and it was well worth the stop!  The food is unbelievably good, Subway and Quiznos has nothing on these guys!"}
{"text":"I guess this place is somewhat of a chain. One of the best turkey subs I've ever had! Pulled turkey that is flavorfull and tender. Many other options, even vegetarian options. As opposed to whats on the strip, this is your snack destination..."}
{"text":"When I visit Vegas I like to grab a sandwich or 2 for my flight back home. Love their Bobby sandwich and the Capistromi. Bread is soft and toppings are decent. Service was friendly and they were made fairly quickly. Can't wait for my next visit to Vegas to get another sandwich."}
{"text":"Very small place, but Huge on taste. I just get take out. The sandwiches are huge, I always share half. They are loaded with goodies. The staff is fun, they sure know how to make sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"The Capastrami was amazing.  I'm not a sub or sandwich person but I believe its the sub bread that made this so great.  It was fresh as if it just came out of the oven and light - not dense.  Flavors were terrific and the pastrami was wonderful.  This place is practically around the corner from my house and I'll come back for more."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna tell you anything that the other reviews haven't already mentioned. True, the \"Bobbie\" is the marque menu item here, and it's really as good as advertised (if you like a good thanksgiving sandwich.) Other than that, I have not been blown away by the food here, above average sandwiches and the like, just not amazing.

Service has been great here though. Several occasions they have run out of something, and comped or discounted parts of our order. These guys have a mom and pop feel despite being a franchise."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas and you're strapped for cash, this is the place to go.

For about $10 bucks, you can get a hearty meal just as delicious as anywhere to satisfy your grumbling stomach.  Never a line when I come to this awesome place.

I'm not a huge fan of their famous Bobbie, but it's still a solid sub that tastes just like they describe it.

But the way to go is Capastrami all the way.  
Their mountain of delicious hot pastrami and coleslaw speaks to the soul.  No other Capriotti's I've been to give as generous portions like this one.  This is the best Capriotti's I've been to.

Waiting time (for making the food): 5min @ 2:00 pm Saturday
Service: 10/10
Cost with tax (no tip): About $10 per person."}
{"text":"I wanted Italian and this shop came up on my search. After reading reviews I wanted a sandwich so... We were right next to it wasting $$ at the souvenir shop. Walked in about noon on a Wednesday not too busy.
Ordered the Philly and the Capastrami. Waited about 20 minutes and food came out. WTHeck...They only made the Philly I wasn't charged for the Capastrami but they quickly acknowledged the mis-communication and made it w/out charge. Both sandwiches were warm. I enjoyed the Capastrami but I haven't been able to get into the east coast add coleslaw to sandwiches thing. I love a good coleslaw Capriottis was good. I would definitely have this again with coleslaw on the side. Very good pastrami. The Philly, I thought, was really good. Bread was nice, cheese was melted into meat and it was warm and quite tasty. We could only eat half and saved the other for the ride back to AZ."}
{"text":"One word: CAPASTRAMI!

My friend heard about this pastrami sandwich that's really good in Vegas but wasn't sure which one. I just randomly yelped it and Capriotti came up so we gave it a try anyway. I don't think I ever like pastrami to begin with because it has too much meat in one sub. Now I'm so glad I gave it a try because pastrami sandwich is definitely my favorite now!!!

They have 3 sizes: Small (9\"), Medium (12\") and Large (20\"). I admit the sub is a bit pricey...Medium for almost 9 bucks!! But if you asked me is it worth it then it's definitely a YES! We got their Cap's special, CAPASTRAMI and it was the bomb! The bread was soft, meat was good and most importantly the cole slaw & russian dressing was like no others! 

Oh yea, you can call in to pre-order as well to avoid the long line/wait! I thought it would be crowded during lunch but good thing it wasn't when we came. Earl is now officially has been replaced by CAPRIOTTI!

DON'T DO : CHEESTEAK SUB! It was hot hot hot, as in spicy!! The flavor was no good either, just another typical cheesteak sub to me.

[Side Story: I ordered one before we took off Vegas only to find out later they gave us the wrong sub!!!!!!!!!! I was so disappointed! Thanks goodness I found out they have one in Beverly Hills so cheers!!!]"}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas, went looking for a good sandwich shop. This was the top listed, so we took a chance. Not disappointed at all. Staff was super friendly and helpful. The sandwich is huge!!! Got the roast beef, it was delicious.  Could only eat 1/4 of the largest one. Saved the rest for later. The cookies are fresh and wonderful.  Love when I tipped them, the guy said \" hey boys we got beer money!\" So rocks! We will be back next time we are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"god damm this place. it is so awesome, i dream of mushroom cheese steaks with the pepper relish.

and then the bobby - thanksgiving goodness in a sammy - wow, hand pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry spread, and mayo - damn tasty sandwich.

oh and my all time favorite - the CAPISTRAMI - hot pastrami, coleslaw, cheese, and thousand island dressing - i cant stop raving about it - 

i like the pepper relish on everything, and usually grab a bag of jalepeno or salt and pepper chips - awesome!

unfortuanley they wont expand past nevada - so whenever im back home in vegas from san diego - i crave this sub shop -"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. Every week I order a sandwich for our family as our weekly tradition. Two weeks in a row we ordered online and when we got home after our pick up the sandwich is missing the key ingredients that we want on it (mushrooms, onions, and sweet peppers). The first time I let it go. Tonight I decided to call to let them know. I talked to the general manager and he defended his side of the story instead of believing me that the sandwich was missing the ingredients. He said \"I highly doubt it could happen twice\" - Well, it did and I'm calling to tell you that it did. He offered for me to come back and have it made it again. Im already home and not going back. He said next time they promise to make it right. Im sorry but that doesn't appear to be a resolution that I will believe since I've had 2 experiences. This was my favorite spot and I they have lost a good, loyal customer due to this situation."}
{"text":"Something that made me laugh was 'the bobbie' being marketed as \"the best sandwich in the world\". Build value justify prices. I miss wawa's version...with turkey gravy on it. Wayyy betterrr"}
{"text":"The bobbi sandwich rocks my world. Leftover thanksgiving turkey sandwiches are my absolute favorite.. and Capriotti's has them all year round. Massive chunks of turkey (none of that deli slices shit, actual turkey breast), cheese, mayo, CRANBERRY SAUCE. Gianormous piece of deliciousness. 

I don't care to order anything else but the bobbi. I have tried, nothing else on that menu is equally delicious. Best cold sandwich you will ever try.

Advice: Avoid lunch hour, its crazy busy and takes forever to get your order (hence the 3 stars). Don't dine in. They only have 3 tables in there and it doesn't add anything to the experience. Not cheap either, when compared to jason's deli or subway. 7-8$ easily... which is why I come here for something I can't get anywhere else."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I stopped here on the way home from Costco. Being frequent customers at other locations, we knew just what we wanted. Me: Grilled Italian, no cheese, with hot peppers. Him: CaoleTurkey, no cheese. Bit of a wait, but no worries. Then our name is called and Boyfriend headed up to the register. He paid, then we had to wait another 5+ minutes for our sandwiches. I thought this was odd, being that all the previous customers had their names called, paid, got their food and walked out the door within a minute. 

We got home and opened those white paper wrappers with much gastronomic anticipation. Him: gleeful! Me: not so much. My Grilled Italian could not have been in contact with the grill for more than 30 seconds, total. There were no delicious, crispy edges. No radioactive orange grilled meat grease. The sandwich was just warm all the way through, like it had been left sitting in the sun for a while. Also, there were no hot peppers to be seen. 

Bottom line: your sandwich at this location may not be the same as your sandwich at all the other locations. Disappointing, big time."}
{"text":"What's not to love?

Their sandwiches are fabulous and the service is quick. Be prepared to wait a few minutes for your sandwich (this definitely isn't Subway!). If given the option, the hot peppers are a must! 

I'm a big Capistrami fan, but the Hot Italian is hard to beat. 

Given that this location is in GVR's food court, right next to slot machines, I prefer to grab the food and take it home."}
{"text":"Capriotti's was a really great sandwich and the bread was outta sight. Although the meat seemed skimpy as compared to my last visit, the flavor was amazing.  I usually don't visit the one on Marks street the food came exactly as ordered."}
{"text":"This place is pretty solid. My turkey sandwich was made with real, thanksgiving-style turkey which was pretty awesome. Bread was soft and fresh. Boyfriend got a cheesesteak which he thoroughly enjoyed as well staff was nice and welcoming. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Me and my coworker had a sandwich and it was so discusting the tomatoes were old the bread didn't taste fresh. And when I called the manager to let him know about it he didn't care
Very disapointed. We are never going back there
There are so many other sandwich shops way better then they are and with also better customer service. The sandwich was horrible."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich is the Capastrami my wife's is the Bobbie.  This restaurant is the newest one in Downtown Summerlin.  Very nice and clean with tv's to watch sports.  Service is fast and friendly.  It's a must try if you haven't had their sandwiches before."}
{"text":"Dry dry dry. If you need mayo to cover up how dry the turkey is then there is an issue. I gave a different branch a try but it was just as disappointing as all of the others. Is recommend picking another sandwich shop"}
{"text":"Always has been my favorite sandwich shop. But this one gave the best service I've ever experienced! I'll never go to another locationnnn. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Initial appearance is clean.  No public restroom. Simple menu. Friendly employees. 

This was my first time, so I had some questions on the menu.  Employees explained with a smile. 

I had the capristrami. Pastrami, cole slaw, and their Russian sauce. Tastes great. Just shy of $8. 

So, with a small sandwich and a drink, the damage was about $11.  

Overall, for the money and the sandwich....I would have rather went to subway to save a couple bucks. 

So, nothing too special. If your in the area, great.....But I wouldn't go outta my way for the place."}
{"text":"GOBBLE GOBBLE

If you're ever yearning for some thanksgiving food before thanksgiving definitely try this spot out and get the \"bobbie\"

Turkey, Stuffing, and Cranberry Sauce in a sandwich. It was very flavorful and was definitely a good hang over food lol oh plus if for someone you feel a little lazy call them up they deliver. 

The 20'' inch subs are good for 4 people but even after that you still want another..thats how good their sandwiches are. I will definitely come back when I get back to Vegas. Peace Yelp Heads!"}
{"text":"Got \"the Bobbie\" sandwich was the bomb!!! One of the best sandwiches I've had. Good prices, good options. I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"These are awesome sandwiches! I'm not talking about the veggie crap. I'm talking cheese steak, Capistrami and Turkey pure love. I like to get the cheese steak with hot and mild peppers. It just melts in your mouth. I can't help but laugh at the negative reviews by the Vegans on here. This place is great, if you want Vegan go get some Humus."}
{"text":"Great cheese steak.  Add the hot peppers and the sweet peppers and the mushrooms.    Italian sub is a good second choice."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and helpful!!! They recommended great choices and informed me of deals going on!! It was my first time here and I felt very welcomed and happy! I'll definitely be back!!! Awesome experience!!!"}
{"text":"Service was ok. My sandwich took forever because the girl kept messing it up, I didn't get to finish eating because I was almost late after my lunch break. They apologized though and gave me free chips. The food tasted great! The restaurant has a lot of seating! My experience was average."}
{"text":"The four star rating made the difference for me as I tried to decide which of various eateries on the same corner to select for a quick lunch after a meeting in Old Town Scottsdale. Although it was lunch hour, the shop wasn't crowded, so I had high expectations of the food and service. Unfortunately, my order was misplaced, so it took over 20 minutes to get a turkey and tomato sandwich. More importantly, when I received it, it gave the appearance of something hastily thrown together - where's the love? As I waited, the place got busier, so they clearly have a good following and I'll give them a second try sometime - but not soon. There are a lot of choices in Old Town, and service is King - here it was a mere pauper."}
{"text":"The Bobbie is truly amazing!  Though I don't care much for the black & blue salad.  The staff is always friendly which is a plus :). It's great that they use fresh ingredients and they roast their own turkey, but just wish there was an option for a smaller size."}
{"text":"I had the same sandwich twice, once it was the last left over piece on a party tray and it got me salivating at what a fresh sandwich might taste like. I forgot the name of the sandwich but it had I think pastrami and this kick ass pastrami on it that really counteracted the meat to perfection. Fresh is definitely better. It's a shame that the sandwiches aren't larger though, that would have been awesome."}
{"text":"I have been visiting this location for years now. It never lets me down. They always make my sandwich exactly the way I want. It's always clean inside and Everyone is always so extremely friendly from the moment you walk in. Today I brought one of my smaller children with me and they all adored him. That made me feel good as well. If you're looking for a mildly healthier alternative to all the other food around the area, you should definitely stop in here and give it a try."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Don't order a catering job from here! They'll purposely lose your slip and not make it. Second year in a row they've done this. I'll take my buisiness elsewhere."}
{"text":"I liked my meatball sub. I'm new to the area and people told me to eat here. It was pretty good. I would go back since I live close. Good subs."}
{"text":"Even though I've been a vegetarian for almost ten years now, I grew up in a family that was very meat-centric. Sometimes I still crave a deli sandwich with soy meat. Whenever I'm hit with that craving and don't feel like making a Tofurkey sub at home I head to Cappriotti's.

This location is conveniently near the Hard Rock and the UNLV Intramural Fields. On a busy day the parking lot can be crowded, but there is usually space in the back.

The service itself is good and the employees are polite. Sometimes it can be slow, especially if there's a crowd. There is a TV that has been playing sports every time I've been there.

I can only rate the veggie sandwiches, and they are delicious. The Veggie Cole Turkey is my favorite, and if you like coleslaw on your sandwich you'll probably love it. My meat eating accomplices swear by The Bobby.

On a couple occasions they have run out of a specific type of veggie meat, but they were more than happy to make substitutes."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular! Yes they use fresh food to make these huge sandwiches and the place is super clean. But for me its all about the cookies that they make each day. The cookies are hot and good I love them with milk. And I've never been more excited to tip. When you tip everyone in the place yells BEER MONEY!  The service is always fast."}
{"text":"Disappointment,  my old friend. I waited in line for 10 minutes even though there was only one elderly couple ahead of me.  Not the cashier's fault,  they had no idea what they wanted before walking up to the order taker. 
 I ordered  the deal they have for $8.99 half a sandwich plus half a salad of your choice. I got the Bobbie & the chicken salad.   I don't eat chicken, but my dogs do so I asked for the chicken on the side. I also asked for mustard on the  Bobbie. I tipped a dollar, I've been in Service my whole life.
 Well, you probably guessed by now, no chicken no mustard.
I got it to go so I didn't realize all this until I got home. 
I was so looking forward to dinner. Now I'm just hungry & sad....."}
{"text":"Cant go wrong...better then subways 4 sure..fresh pulled turkey ...better orderonline if u in a gurry it can get very busy during lunch time...im getting addicted to this place"}
{"text":"Oh Capriotti's I just can't with that Russian dressing!  However the Bobby is made by thanksgiving angels!!  I can only rate this chain a 3 though because it can be hit or miss!!  Today I'm a little disappointed my cheese steak had no onions or peppers!  The steak quality is ok but not good enough to leave out the flavor from the veggies!  For $17 please make my order correctly!"}
{"text":"First time at this location but they might have just made me the best Bobbi so far!!  The Bobbi is so yummy!! It hard for me to order anything else!!  And those salt and vinegar chips go so well with it!!"}
{"text":"Why when I make a sandwich at home it never taste like any of these sandwich places!!! This place is awesome service is good food is better. If they served this on a steaming pile of crap... I would remove the bottom bread (let's be honest)  and go to town on the rest"}
{"text":"Every time I eat here I call in my order so it can be ready when I get there and they always have it ready right away. And they hook it up with the meat! Their sandwiches are not lacking at all!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here.  Here after he had been a couple times and he knew exactly what we were going to have...the 20\" cheese steak with sweet peppers, hot peppers and mushrooms.  We of course split it.  It was awesome.  One of the best cheese steaks I have ever had.  It doesn't seem to be that busy in the evening, which is when we went.  That was nice, we didn't have to stand in line and got our food right away.  This place is nice change from the usual."}
{"text":"The Veggie Philly is are amazing! you can't even tell the difference that it's not meat.  My parents ate it thinking it was meat.  The Veggie Turkey is also amazing.  Best vegetarian subs in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Always on point!
I love the Bobbie of course but sometimes I just like a cold turkey.
I love all their peppers especially that peppers relish! Delish! 
The fact that they have made fresh everyday actual turkey is amazing! I mean you could have thanksgiving any day!
We usually pick up sandwiches on our way to the lake or the river and they will even lake proof wrap your sandwich if requested! 
Staff is pretty quick and polite."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and got the Bobbie sandwich (turkey, stuffing and cranberry). Thanksgiving in July! It was really good. The place is cute, clean and the staff really friendly. We've heard from friends that this place was really good, and were not disappointed. Will definitely come again and try more of the yummy sounding sandwiches."}
{"text":"Apparently they are known for their pastrami which was good and their thanksgiving turkey sub. that was w.e, Cranberry jam or something on the sandwich. These sandwiches sucks when they are cold and they get hard. (no pun intended) It was a decent meal, 20 inch sandwich for like 11.99 or 12.99 The pastrami was pretty decent but when in Rome, do as Romans and go all out and get something better =] Not bad if you're on a budget though."}
{"text":"They have the best sandwich in America!
The bobbie is my favorite!!!!
Their staffs are friendly and fast..
I will back fosho..
Ohhh yeahhhh...."}
{"text":"Great place to get a sandwich. I love Capastrami here. It's an amazing balance with the slaw."}
{"text":"I love this place and it's usually a stop for me while in Vegas. The Capastrami is amazing and I usually get a large so I have some leftovers for later. It's amazing as a late night snack after some heavy drinking in Vegas."}
{"text":"Small, medium, and large are definitely American-sized portions (9\", 12\", and 20\", respectively). I had a small over the course of two meals. The large looked intimidating as the guys behind the counter were wrapping one up for a delivery order.

We visited Capriotti's twice during our four-day stint in Vegas and tried the grilled Italian, Philly cheese steak, and the Bobbie. I'm a big fan of both hot sandwiches and melted cheese, so the Philly cheese steak was my favorite out of the three. It's also one of the better Philly cheese steaks I've had.

Each sandwich was between $6-8 (small and medium sizes). This was a welcome respite from shelling out two to three times more per person for a meal in this town. And the sandwiches were delicious and satisfying! Even the Bobbie, a cold sub, was a delight to munch on since it's basically a lot of Thanksgiving crammed between two halves of a baguette.

The verdict: If you want to give your wallet a break, but your taste buds crave more, head over to the closest Capriotti's and pig out for under $10."}
{"text":"hot peppers on the capastrami are delish! The coleslaw sets the sandwich apart leaving you feeling not so badly about the deeeeelish pastrami. checked in with yelp and got a free large soda! next time want to try the bobbie"}
{"text":"Sandwiches much better than subway! Great value and good options for vegetarians. Throughly enjoyed the veg cheese steak sandwich!"}
{"text":"I rate this a 2 because I so far have found at least 5 turkey bones in sandwich, if I wasn't careful a few of them would have been big enough to cause major damage to my teeth."}
{"text":"On our receipt from yesterday's visit, we noticed: \"Tell Us About Your Experience?\" 

I blinked at the following question: 
\"Please tell us why you were not Highly Satisfied? Be as specific as you would like?\"

Here was my cut 'n paste response:

\"Please know, there are many choices in the area for sandwiches.  Jimmy John's, Corleone's, Jersey Mikes, Vermont Sandwich, just to name a few; along with Al's Beef and Luke's of Chicago (next door).  We rec'd a text upsize message and decided to give you another try.  

\"On our first visit, the meat (roast beef) on your Slaw Be Jo was dark brown.  On our second visit, there was garbage on the floor. I still have the pictures and your employees did nothing, when I told them about it.  It was in the Prep area btw. 

\"Last night, we ordered two upsized sandwiches which were very good... Meatball & the Bobbie, along with one drink.  But, $18.26 seems at least $4 too high and that is taking into account a larger sandwich.  I really, really want to like your place, but I find it hard given the above.\"

Okay, here's a funny aside...  At the end of their questionnaire, they asked which social media do I use.  

The usual suspects were there, such as Facebook, Twitter, My Space (who uses My Space anymore?) and Fick'er, but no Yelp.  

I had to write Yelp as \"other\". D'oh!!"}
{"text":"Much better then subways....it is fresh and good to go...cant complain....the prices are reasonable...2nd time here...make sure to preorder during lunchtime to get out on time...."}
{"text":"I don't know how this capriotti's always finds a way to get my order wrong but they do. It's actually very impressive how bad the screw it up. Also it seems the bread is always hard and old."}
{"text":"The turkey is amazing - because it's not deli meat, it's turkey!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place the food is always so good the service awesome. I like many others love the Bobbie, also had the chicken cheesesteak, and Capastrami no complaints here. I say 2 thumbs up a must have once in your life and I promise it wouldn't be your last visit to your local Capriottis. So enjoy and be kind my friends."}
{"text":"Messed up our to go order and didn't believe us. The manager Amber actually made us text her a photo of the wrong sandwich and still wouldn't give us a refund. Then she asked us to come in the next day because they were closing and didn't want to fix their mistake. What would we come in the next day for when my kids need dinner now?! What horrible customer service for such an easy fix!"}
{"text":"Every. Single. Time.  My order is wrong every single time from this location.  No idea what even to say anymore.  Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Delicious! It was my first time here so I wasn't sure what to eat. I'm not too picky and will typically eat anything called a sandwich, it's my favorite food group. I got the Italian sub. Bread was soft and fresh, meat was crispy on the edges from being toasted. I ordered a 7 inch (or 9\"?) but they made a mistake and gave me the large one. The first half was so good I couldn't stop myself from attempting the second half. After 2 bites I realized this thing is mammoth and decided to save it for later. My only disappointed was when I realized I'd have to take it home and defend it from my husband and boys. 
Side note: I was in at lunch, it was clean, speedy, friendly, and busy. I also found it interesting that I was the only female there! That's when you know it's a good place! No snotty ladies talking about their wheat free, dairy free, egg free, vegetarian diet restrictions."}
{"text":"I like to eat here late nights very peaceful when you just want to chill and pig out."}
{"text":"Grew up down the street from the original location in Delaware and always enjoy finding one when I travel for work. Not nearly as good as the one back home but still a million times better then Subway or Firehouse, etc."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop! We always call in our order and they always have it ready and waiting no matter how busy they are. Great staff!"}
{"text":"I work out in Boulder City and usually phone the order but still have to wait in store after ordering 20 min prior to pick up. Today was one of the worst experiences EVER.  I called, they picked up after 5 rings and just hung up on me. I called back thinking it was an accident. Rang again 5 times they did the same thing finally on the fifth call I got a hold of someone and they asked me to hold. I was on the counter, ringer off hook for 5 min then she asked are you still there and sounded disappointed when I said yes.   I ordered and she said come by in 25 - 30 min which I did. Two other people came and went AFTER the fifteen minutes I sat there. Finally I asked hey how about the grilled Italian I ordered 45 min ago?! Cheyenne said it was still on the grill. I said i ordered it over 45 min ago and she quite snidely said well you can't rush  a grilled Italian. Sorry but 45 min.  I called her out and said she didn't have to be so snide about it that I was a customer who wasn't happy. She had already rung me out so I could't just leave. I finally got my sandwich which by the way was the worst one I had ever gotten there.  I called her over and told her she needs to learn how to deal with unhappy customers and she just shrugged an walked away. I said I wanted to talk to the Manager. She said we don't have one. Shift supervisor?  We don't have one. I said I wanted a number to someone in charge. I got the cell phone of someone named Debra who was supposedly the owner and started to voice my complaint (after I left the shop) She proceeded to tell me they (her employees) were all little liars only there for a paycheck and she could't fire them because they were to hard to train. She said this was her own private prison and she couldn't wait for the day she could just walk away from it. I wasn't sure what to say but told her to have a better day and hung up. I have a sneaky suspicion this woman was not the owner but someone the crew uses to send disgruntled customers to. The sandwich was so greasy and the meat was burnt I just threw it away. Plus it had oil and vinegar which I asked not to have on it and mushrooms didn't even see that on the ingredient list.  NASTY SANDWHICH and NASTY EMPLOYEES. They won't be getting any more of my money and I am telling EVERYONE about my experience BOYCOTT this particular Capriotti's until they know how to do business in there dank little excuse for a store! They probably spit in the sandwich too.  NEVER going to trust these people again. Boulder City is one of the most Charming places and an experience like this makes me sad."}
{"text":"Vegetarian turkey sub.  Holy crap.  The best sub ever.

The boy and I stopped at this location on our way back from a hike at Red Rock Canyon.  We were both pretty hungry but still ordered small subs, which were more than enough.  Half of a small would have been more than sufficient for lunch, but I ate the whole thing because it was so damn tasty.

They also offer vegetarian cheese steak subs, which sounds pretty interesting.  

Oh, and the boy got a regular turkey sub and was impressed by the freshness of everything and that it was actual turkey, not processed slices.

When in Las Vegas again I will definitely be making a trip to Capriotti's."}
{"text":"Capriottis reminds me a lot of Jimmy Johns. Basic sandwhiches that are delicious. I had there Steak Sandwhich and it came out to me steaming hot. It was really good and well worth checking out. I will be back."}
{"text":"Probably the best sandwich shop in the area.  My favorite is the \"SlawBeJo\", with homemande roast beef, provolone cheese, cole slaw, russian dressing and mayo....and I don't even like cole slaw!...but it's so good with the roast beef!  Their sandwiches are unique in that none of the meats are your typical sliced meat..they are more like a \"pulled\" meat...so good!  

Clean place, friendly staff.

Expect a small wait, even if the place is empty...but it is soooo worth it!"}
{"text":"Went back to Phoenix to visit family and was intent on getting a pastrami sandwich from one of the other deli's but never found the time to go. On the way back home my daughter suggested Capriotti's and I figured it was worth trying it out. When I got there I was dead set on the pastrami, called the \"Capastrami\", but notice a picture of the \"The Bobbie\" which is real pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry, and mayo. I couldn't make up my mind so i ordered both. They were nice enough to give me half of each to eat there, and wrapped the other halves up to take with me, making the 5 hour drive back to SD so much more tolerable. They were both awesome, but I now crave the Bobbie and am making my daughter bring me one out when she comes to visit. :)"}
{"text":"Perhaps more like 3.5.

I had \"The Bobbie\" and boy was that filling.  It was your turkey cranberry \"Thanksgiving\" sandwich.  Make sure to come really hungry because not only do you get a huge sandwich, but it comes with chips as well.  I would have wanted the sandwich warm.  From what I remember, it came cold.

You can take your food on the go, eat there... You'd probably want to save half for another meal - something I should have done.

They had a pretty good selection of sandwiches... I'll have to check out this chain restaurant another time if I run into it again.

The service was quick and it's better than your typical Subway sandwich - the flavors are way more complex."}
{"text":"So after a long grueling 10 hour day at work, I figured I'd grab a sub on the way home.  The 2 young men working there had other ideas...

I arrived at 7:40 pm, 20 minutes before they closed. Upon entering, one of the two guys was sweeping the floor, and he looked up at me with a scowl as if to say \"get out of my way.\"  Nice greeting, kid.

I then approached the counter where the other guy had his back to me making sandwiches. He then turned around and obviously saw me.  With zero eye contact, he ignored me completely. No greeting, no \"hi, I'll be right with you,\" no nothing.

After standing there for quite some time, I turned around and walked out.  It was as if I were never even there.  And I will never ever return to be ignored again. Thanks guys, for treating me as poorly as one could possibly be treated."}
{"text":"Sucks when you order Togo and the clerk asks what you want on your sandwich and you say no mustard and an hour later when your ready to eat lunch you open it up and tons of mustard! Lesson learned continue to go to the Sahara location 
What a waste of ten bucks"}
{"text":"I have been at other stores of the same chain and this is by far the best store. Friendly,  my sandwich made to perfection as I don't want everything on it. Go people wish more employees were this great. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Just a short walk from the Hilton Grand Vacation this place scores high on customer service and food quality. You may have to wait a little to get your order, but it's definitely worth it, I will definitely come back during my next visit to Sin City!"}
{"text":"This is the Capriotti's I frequent most often, so imagine my surprise when I went to a different location and they had wheat bread. Hands down, no questions asked, I always prefer wheat to white. I just thought Cap's didn't offer that option. Nope, THIS Cap's doesn't offer that option. Besides that, this a good location. The service here is always both fast and courteous. For a sandwich shop they actually have quite a few vegetarian options other than the usual \"veggie sub.\" You just have to be willing to eat faux meat in the form of soy products. Which, I am not willing to do, but thought it was an interesting option all the same."}
{"text":"Decent sandwich shop with plenty of options.

My wife and I stopped by this place when were vacationing in Vegas last year.  Luckily for us, it was within walking distance from the Stratosphere where we were staying.

We had searched the reviews on Yelp and decided to give this place a try.

My wife ordered the 'Bobbie'; basically thanksgiving dinner stuffed within a loaf of bread.  Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo.

I ordered the Cheese Steak with mushrooms and onions.

While both of our sandwiches were prepared well and served at a decent temperature, we both felt the same way about the food.  It was decent, but was missing some flavor in some places.  A little salt could have benefited both of our sandwiches.

While the bread itself was delicious and fresh, it was a bit of a chore gnawing through it.  The Bobbie my wife got could have benefited from being toasted.

While I feel the food falls inbetween 2 and 3 stars, I felt the need to give them 3 because the service was stellar.  The staff was very attentive and was very helpful despite the fact that we were probably the 85735739th out-of-town vacationing couple they'd served that day.

Apparently we came near a strange early closing time and the manager sent us off with a large bag of 6 whole loaves of their bread on the house!!!  We happily accepted these and they came in useful to snack on while in the hotel room.

We may return to try something else off the menu the next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"I always look forward to a sandwich from here...lately that's been the chicken cheese steak, but I also love the Bobby and the slaw b joe.  I wish the GVR location had the large option, but they only offer small and medium.  Basically they have very good ingredients in nice portion sizes, so it's hard to go wrong.  This is one place that deserves its local legend status."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Capriotti's, and have been regular customers of the Craig Road/Home Depot shop for a decade. We can honestly say that we have never had a bad meal. The consistency of high quality subs and the great variety make this a place we can't resist, no matter what our bathroom scales may say! We've never had guests that we haven't treated to Capriotti's, and we've never had a rude encounter with any of the staff. 

Some marvelous subs to try - great with a group, where everyone shares: 

Capistram--melt-in-your mouth pastrami with no gristle or excess fat. Both the swiss and provolone cheeses add another layer of flavor to the pastrami. The Russian dressing pulls it all together. The Cole Slaw adds texture and juice. Bibs might be advised, since this sub can be drippy-licious. 

The Bobbie -- Thanksgiving on a sub, just the way we like it: Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo. When we have Thanksgiving at someone's home, and we don't get leftovers, we like to stop at Caparotti's the next day so we can pretend we're enjoying all those yumdiddy-great leftovers. 

Cole Turkey -- a \"Bobbie\" without the cranberry sauce or stuffing. For those who want to assuage their after-Thanksgiving guilt by avoiding sweet cranberry sauce and an extra bread product. I still like it loaded full-tilt-boogie with the entire table of treats!

Slaw Be Jo - thinly sliced roast beef, tender and moist, lathered with Russian dressing, mayo and their sweet-savory cole slaw, topped with provolone cheese. It's a toss up when you're in a beef mood whether the Slaw Be Jo or the Cheese Steak is the tastiest. We normally rely on a coin flip, since our taste buds crave both! 

I don't do red sauce so I rely on the opinion of guests from out of town who tell us they love the Sausage sub with marinara sauce, as well as the meatball sub. I'm also not an italian meat and hot pepper fan, so again, I rely on the opinions of those who love this combination. 

Yes, I hear you. What the heck am I doing living in Las Vegas if I don't love Italian or Mexican food? Fortunately, at Capriotti's, there are choices to suit everyone's taste buds. 

I've yet to taste a better cheesesteak anywhere in the valley, nor a finer hot pastrami. 

Note to service dog users: the staff is welcoming to service dogs, and you won't have any problem with access. They keep their distance, practice good service dog etiquette by not trying to pet the service dogs, and always take time to remark about how well mannered they are. 

I only wish I had some photos to share, but the truth is, I'm always so anxious for that first bite that I forget to aim the phone."}
{"text":"I heard about Capriotti's from my partner who discovered them while in Las Vegas for work; decided to try them out several months ago. The sandwiches are very good, and when I ate meat, I enjoyed the Bobbie.

However, since becoming vegetarian almost one year ago, I hadn't had the opportunity to dine here again. That was until I discovered they have vegetarian options! I returned a few days ago for lunch and sampled the veg turkey sub as well as the veg cheesesteak sub. Both were pretty good; I really enjoyed my lunch. The cheesesteak was ordered with mushrooms and was full of cheesy-oniony-peppery goodness but I think I preferred the veg turkey sandwich for its simplicity. Worth a shot if you happen to be in this part of Chandler. (Note- they do cook the veg cheesesteak on the same grill that they cook their real meat on, be forewarned if this bothers you.. although it clearly states this on the menu. Request if they can cook it on a freshly cleaned, different part of the grill.)"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in town IMHO. They have a 20 incher which is plenty for two people."}
{"text":"I came in with every intention of loving this place because I remember enjoying the Bobby with friends in Vegas many years ago.  The beginning started off well with very friendly and attentive service. 

My husband chose the cheesesteak but was disappointed. While the bread was good, meat was dry, the cheese didn't taste good and the mayonnaise tasted sour. He would give it a 2/5. 


I had a half half Caps Chopped salad (no olives) and the small tomato soup. My salad was filled with meat and cheese to the point of wishing there was more lettuce. I would give it 4/5. The soup looked like a bowl of soup and was very chunky. I thought it was good but not great 3/5. It was also served with a good amount of bread on the side. 

The iced tea was a little bitter, which was disappointing. 

All in all we will average it out at 3/5. Would we come back? Maybe...if for some reason I wanted to splurge on massive carbs and have a Bobby."}
{"text":"All I'm gonna say is Capastrami Sandwich. Love it and miss it. Can someone send one over to Fort Wayne, IN? I'm preggers and need a fix. :)"}
{"text":"So I come into capriottis one late December Sunday afternoon with my mom bc she recommended I try their veggie cheese steak. I choose to order a VCS w/o cheese, the lady gives me this look like I was crazy, & asks \"are u sure??!\" I said yes bc I don't do cheese. Then she asks me what size? small medium o large. I ask what's the difference bc it's obviously my 1st time there, she then pretty much sucks her teeth & shows me the sizes behind her. Very rude. She could've said the dimensions & I would've got the idea.I started becoming unsure during my ordering process whether it would be a very good sandwich being that I said w/o cheese & it IS a cheese steak sandwich, so I ask what's in it? The lady says it's pretty much the meat & bread. I see on the menu that u can add sweet & crispy onions & mushrooms for additional charge. I choose to add the crispy & sweet onions & the mushrooms. I never felt so confused by adding two freakin different onions & some mushrooms to a sandwich, wow! Usually, when I CHOOSE to eat out, I expect the ppl that serve my food to have a certain friendly demeanor, with the integrity to be able to explain a menu item, & the know how to give recommendations to anyone walking in to somewhere NEW with a FOOD ALLERGY. (Lactose) On top of all that the guy behind me got his food first. I got home & tried my $13 sandwich & was disappointed mostly bc it was so dry, the server could have easily recommended SOME kind of sauce or something to make my $13 sandwich worth the $. Also the place was a mess, no one wiping their sticky ass tables, crumbs all over the floor. I definitely would spend time eating inside the place. My aunt just said there's one in the casino.. Told her we should've went to that 1 coz the service @ this 1 SUCKS! Two stars for not making my stomach hurt @ the end. I'll check back w u in if something changes in the next few hours."}
{"text":"I was trying to get a party platter  4 20 inch sands in 3 hours and the guy said we need 24 hrs notice. Joke!! I did get it at the Flamingo location and nice lady but food was bad and for $60 I will never go back again."}
{"text":"The lady was very nice and said they could make a party platter of sandwiches in 3 hours but the amount of meat they used was not enough and the Ham was terrible!! I would have been better off buying it at a grocery deli and saved a ton of cash. Too expensive 4 20inch sandwiches cost $60 bucks - major rip off!!"}
{"text":"There's really not much that can be said about Capriottis that hasn't been discussed over and over again. It's a solid sandwich shop, always provides great customer service, and more importantly, created the Bobbie. I mean seriously, what's the first thing you think of when you hear the name Capriottis? Bobbie. #winning

Here's how much I like Bobbie. It's Thanksgiving week, I know that on Tuesday I have a function for work that will be highlighted by a Thanksgiving feast celebration with turkey and all the fixins', Thursday is Thanksgiving, so obviously that will be another turkeyfest, on my Monday lunch, knowing all these things I decide to give Bobbie a holla. That's how much I like Bobbie. Bobbie is da man. The turkey on Bobbie is almost always moist, the stuffing on Bobbie always has great flavor, I'm a no cranberry guy but everyone I talk to says the cranberries on Bobbie are great. My favorite thing about this specific location is the owner/manager (I think) Heavenly. She's always super friendly, keeps the line moving, and has never messed up any of my orders. On a rare occasion I may venture away from my pal Bobbie and get a chicken cheesesteak, which is very good, but pales in comparison to Bob. 

It's great to see this brand growing throughout the country with some new locations opening up back east. I'm a big fan and believer of Capriottis and look forward to my next visit with my pal Bobbie."}
{"text":"Horrible staff!!! It's was my first time so I had no idea where to order from and the guy that took our order was a real jerk. My boyfriend and I could hear how loud he was exhale impatiently for us to finish looking at the menu and hurry up and order our food. After this experience, I don't recommend coming to this location. Then after I repeated 3 times asked for \"NO salt or chess\" somehow I get \"EXTRA salt and chess\". Sadly, I paid for food I couldn't eat because I'm lactose intolerant and I can't eat anything with extra salt. Then I had to waiting 34 minutes on the food when no one was ordering after us or picking up there food orders. Never Again!"}
{"text":"I'd give a half star if I could...The service here is terrible... I've been here twice in the last couple of weeks and it has taken 25-30 minutes to actually get the food I ordered. Not sure if it is a management change or just incompetence, but I doubt I will come back to this location, and I would advise others to avoid it unless you have tons of time on your hands. Sad... it wasn't this way a few months ago.

Also had a plastic bread tie attached to my sandwich. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"I stalk these guys when I'm in a city that has em.  I don't live in a Capriotti's city anymore, but I live in a Capriotti's world.  I can live off of the cheesesteak with peps, bobbie, and capistrami."}
{"text":"These are the best sandwiches anywhere!   The Capistrami is incredible!   This location is better than any other I have been to."}
{"text":"What an amazing sandwich and very nice staff I got the Philli cheesesteak and it was amazing next place in town for your sandwich craving"}
{"text":"Go to another Capriotti's.  This one stinks.

This is my second one star review for this Capriottis.  Decided to go back after two years to see if things changed.  They haven't.  Big lack of turkey.  If I wanted a lot of bread and a little meat I would go to Firehouse.  There's nothing like being ripped off when you're hungry.

I've had Capriottis from many locations and this is the worst."}
{"text":"We got a mustard and mayo sandwich with turkey as a condiment.  Glad they're making money by cutting back on the goods here but it sucks if you're a customer."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Nice portions, great flavors.  Leaves Subway and Firehouse in the dust."}
{"text":"I've been holding back from writing this review, giving this place chance after chance, but after getting an ungodly amount of mayo when I asked for marinara, I'm done.

I've been there about 6,7 times since they opened. First time took a long time, and the staff was a bit rude, but it was made well. After that, there was at least one thing wrong with everything I've ordered from here. Sugar cookie when I asked for chocolate chip, regular chicken when I ask for veggie, turkey when I asked for pastrami. 

The hiring manager here needs to take a hard look at what he/she's done. The service here is flawed. I give them 2 stars because it's a greatly constructed sandwich, but more often than not there's a fatal error in my meal"}
{"text":"This is the third Capriottis I've been to, but the first in Las Vegas. An this was by far the slowest service I have ever received!  Don't be stupid enough to ask for them to give you a hot sandwich, it takes 20 minutes!  We ordered and they served four parties (three ordered after us) before our sandwiches came up. Would have been more, but it was slow, and only three groups ordered after us.  Cold food is the only option if you have somewhere to be, or a limited lunch break."}
{"text":"Another place I pass by on my walk and I have seen thier ads in several publications saying they were voted #1 in Las Vegas for thier \"Bobbie\" = a Turkey, cranberry & dressing sandwhich.....I passed on that & opted for a 9 inch Italian on wheat and was told they only had white bread, so I went with it. I just got the sandwhich, no drink or chips & the total came to $7.12 which I thought was a little steep considering the lunch buffet at Main St Casino is $9.

 For the amount of people behind the counter & the amount of customers in the place it took awhile to get my order = I looked at the LV WEEKLY Magazine all the way through & the order still wasnt ready. NBD as I really wasnt in a hurry.

The sandwhich was OK and had alot of meat on it compared to a Subway sub. I guess haveing been in Miami and a rocks throw from Casola's I got a little spoiled when it comes to portion, quality & Value bang for your buck.

It is what it is & I'll probably go back again & try another type sub one of these days."}
{"text":"This location SUCKS! I will never eat there again. It was the first time my taste buds were turned off by the taste of a Caprastrami. I could tell the cook had not used enough meat, and that it did not look like it normally looks when other locations make it. Plus the cook was busy goofing around, and joking with his co-worker and not focusing on preparing my food. Management looked at my sandwich and said \"he could make me another one,\"but it would be the exact same sandwich. I was exausted from heat, and hungry and in no mood to argue, I took my suspect looking food and hoped it would taste better than it looks. IT DIDN'T! it was dry and flavorless. Not the thick, juicy, gooey with cheese like I get at the Better Capriott's. Spend your money somewhere else, they overcharge for crappy food, and bad management."}
{"text":"I call ahead of time to order for a quick pick up. Time estimates are always right on target. 

Quick in and out. Maybe it helps that I give them \"beer money\" every time. 

Employees are continuously making sandwiches due to the location the shop is always busy. 

Cool employees. Keep in mind it's a sandwich shop; casualness is expected from the creators. Which is fine with me bc the product is on point EVERY TIME."}
{"text":"Go here once every two weeks, at least. The bobbie is my favorite (no surprise) and overall, the service is good and the food is amazing. My only issue is the wait time. 15 minutes to make a sandwich! All kidding aside, great place and will continue to go."}
{"text":"If you are planning on eating here don't try calling ahead for your order. I have tried twice and both times I was put on hold for 15 minutes and forgotten about and hung up on. So you might as well just go in and wait for your order or order online"}
{"text":"Every location throughout the valley is great. Sure I've had days when the service was a bit off but it was worth it for the delicious subs.  One tip, go early for the Bobbie...later in the day the bread is not so fresh and the only turkey meat inside the sub is dark meat."}
{"text":"My mouth salivates every time I think of their pastrami sandwich! Call me a fatty but I don't care. I would eat one everyday if I could! The Russian sauce complemented the already flavorful pastrami & made the sandwich stand out from other pastrami sandwiches I've had. I would definitely come back to this place because the sandwiches are reasonably priced & the service was fast. I can't wait to try their other sandwiches!"}
{"text":"First time here.... went during weekday lunch and the place was a MESS! Sticky floors, dirty tables, soda area a wreck - YUK!
I don't blame the 2 guys working there at all. It was obvious that they were hustling to keep up with the takeaway orders. They were doing their best.  I blame the management - you really need an extra person there to pick up the lunch rush slack.  I worry that if they didn't have time to keep the front clean, how good is the back/prep??

Aside from that... the sandwich was great (had the beef/coleslaw - YUMMY!) The staff was pleasant and friendly (despite being overwhelmed) 5 stars for food, 1 star for the restaurant conditions. I'll go back, but never during the week. Please send them some help!!!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was okay. The guy who makes sandwiches is the same guy who swipes your card on the cash without washing hands. The staff were very rude. Probably haven't seen a restaurant staff in Vegas who are more rude for the five years I lived here"}
{"text":"This review begins and ends with the Bobbie. The Bobbie was introduced in 1989 at Capriotti's and is arguably their most popular sandwich. It features turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. It's like a portable Thanksgiving dinner that can be enjoyed anywhere and at anytime of the year.

I'd love to add some info on their other sandwiches, but quite honestly, I've never ordered anything but the Bobbie."}
{"text":"Just ordered great sandwich great service delivery was here within the time they said this location is A+"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location no matter how busy or slow, I always receive excellent customer service. The employees here are attentive, efficient, and friendly. They already have a great product and adding great service makes me keep coming back even more!"}
{"text":"Really? 5 stars from everyone? I guess I knew people from Vegas didnt know what good food was, but whatever. I got the Italian, and it was just alright. Something I could have made at my own home if I had the will to buy all those different meats. I was the only person in there and for some reason It still took them over 20 mins to make my sandwich."}
{"text":"I love the food and service was as it should be  (good) but it took them 10 minutes to do my sandwitch and I was one of 2 people in the store. Growing pains are unacceptable. This company is not new."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop.  I love all their specialty sandwiches but especially their Bobbi which always helps when I am craving a bit of Thanksgiving since its made of homemade turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing.  This place is so yummy!"}
{"text":"After gambling a bit, we wanted a quick bite to eat. Found this place on Yelp and wanted to try it out. I got the Cheese Steak with Mushroom. That thing was piping hot! The cheese was all nice and melted. As for the taste, sad to say it was just ok. The sandwich was rather oily. Wish I can expand on it more but honestly the sandwich wasn't that memorable.

As for the service, the girl at the cashier must have been new. She was struggling a bit and needed assistance. 

Definitely use the Yelp check in. The large soda was huge! Had to two hand that bad boy!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sub shop in the Valley.  Excellent bread, fresh ingredients, ok price, online ordering, and fast/friendly service.  You can't go wrong with the Capastrami or Cole-turkey.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I always try to make time to stop by and pick up a sandwich from Capriottis whenever I'm in Vegas, preferably not when I'm hungover though..

This location is right across from the Hard Rock Hotel and is nice and clean with plenty of tables if you want to dine in. They are most popular for their signature subs: The Bobbie and The Capistrami. I'm not much of a Pastrami person myself so I always order the Bobbie(turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo). Its literally like Thanksgiving wrapped in a nice sandwich. It is served cold but the bread is soft, kind of like a bigger longer french dinner roll? The turkey is fresh and cranberry sauce is not too sweet so it complements the stuffing and turkey well and the stuffing is def something different.. they all combine to make an AWESOME sandwich :) I really want one right now...at least they opened up new locations in Beverly Hills and Encino for all of us in LA county :)"}
{"text":"Used to be great. Pretty bland now and it seems like they are short handed. Took 20 minutes to get a sandwich when it wasn't that busy... Bring back the quality and flavor to keep business strong."}
{"text":"This is the only sandwich shop I go to cause their sandwiches are Real tasty and you get what you pay for. I recommend \"the bobby \""}
{"text":"An amazing sandwich shop ever. I tried pastrami and bobby sandwiches and felt way better than subway. Something similar would be Earl's sandwich. Among all of other sandwich shop, I think this is the best place."}
{"text":"Vary good  sandwiches and different it's like a turkey dinner in a sandwich and it's good"}
{"text":"First off, I love Capriotti's. I always make it a point to go when I can. This one just happens to be a few minutes from my house. I have come here at least four times already and each time the experience has gotten worse. Initially I gave them the benefit of the doubt but it's just horrible at this point. This time, four separate people were served their food before I was. I finally went up to the counter and asked how the order was coming along, only to be asked \"what did you order?\" - finally after another ten minutes they hand me the order which they happen to get wrong. Not really sure what the problem is, there were three people here, only one seemed to be working and the two I encountered were very rude. I am going to just find the nearest store beyond this, not worth giving this place my business with treatment like this, by the looks of it, others seem to agree. I guess this is the problem with franchises and owners who have to depend on bad employees, I hope they do something about it soon."}
{"text":"Service was amazing, front gentleman was very nice and kind. Preparation was amazingly fast. Normally this would warrant a one or two star but the staff was so nice, made up for this. Ordered two sandwiches, one small and one medium and they gave me two small. By the time I realized, was already half way home, next time will check. Food was amazing as always so will just call this a human error and continue going to this amazing place."}
{"text":"Fast service,  friendly. I got tired of the bad service at east horizon and gladly drive 3 miles to go here. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Disappoining, rude to kids. Heard great things, lots of great reviews, and recommended by people I trust, but not somewhere I will go again. Employes were disinterested and barely short of rude when helping us.  Ordered turkey (dry), pastrami (indistinguishable from the cole slaw dressing), and grilled cheese for our 2 kids.  The crack head taking our order said no problem, but when they rung it up they charged us for 4 full sized sandwiches. I'm not cheap, but $5 for plain grilled cheese? Sandwiches were big, but bland and lacking in flavor. Seem more interested in quantity than quality, and their seating is insufficient. Employees look like they are all on parole, and interactions mimic what I imagine a prison cafeteria line to be like.  Will not go again, do not recomend."}
{"text":"Always a good sandwich at this Capriotti's.

I love the free large drink upon yelp check in at this location, only wish all locations offered as much.

Today I ordered the small meatball sub. Delicious and served hot and fresh. I tried to open the bread a little to show the meatballs and sauce in the pic. 

Another good thing about Capriotti's is their app gives you a free sandwich (9 inch) for every 10 orders over 4.99. Good to know if you are a frequent sub eater as I am."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick medium Bobby sandwich for my stepmum. Fast and friendly service and always made fresh to order. Clean restaurant with all fountain drinks working. Grill was clean and had plenty of chips to choose from to accompany her meal. We chose the medium bag of jalapeño chips.

Received a free regular drink with Yelp check in. Located near MountainView hospital so will be back again this week. Remember to scan your receipt for points on your CAPAddicts Rewards app to earn free sandwiches and other items.

Thank you Capriotti's for good fast service."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and picked up a cranberry slam sandwich. It was amazingly delicious. I would knock off a half star for a few grisly bits, but otherwise real good flavor, fresh, and yummy.  I had my food in less than five minutes, so no slow service for me today, as compared to other reviewers.  It wasn't very busy when I stopped in shortly before noon."}
{"text":"So, I like eating something cheap before going to the movies.  The Regal Cinema is right next door, so I thought I would have a Pink's hot dog, but to my surprise, Pinks is closed.  So I headed over here and ordered an Italian sub.  I was pleased that the small sub was large, filled with good lunch meats and tasted pretty good.  I didn't think a walk up counter would do a good job.  I would come back."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Ordered my usual, chicken cheese steak... One word, DRY."}
{"text":"We love Capriottis. This is our go to sandwich shop but this location has horrible service. We ordered one sandwich and it took 40 minutes!! Wait no, 45 minutes.  Literally the worse wait for one large sandwich.  Next time we will go across the street to In and Out. Or maybe hit up another location. I'm so disappointed In this location. Never again. And the thing that sucks is its right by our house. What a bummer."}
{"text":"I will remember
The winter evenings
Trodding through the slush into your dark doorway;
The Bobbies,
Warm in their soft, white paper.
The call-aheads from work,
The person bearing the plastic bag of wrapped wonders,
Unrolling them eagerly on our desks.
I lay my flower here
On this the grave of what was once
The Greatest Sandwich Shop.
I will not forget. 

RIP Capriotti's Middleton"}
{"text":"I paid $17 for a large sandwich To split with my two friends. I specifically asked that the sandwich be cut in thirds. We are now trying to tear the sandwich apart. Argh. I asked for extra mayo & extra pepper. Sandwich is dry & I don't see pepper at all. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I have been this sandwich shop many times and USUALLY the sandwiches are good. Today I ordered a capistrami  sandwich and instead of pastrami and coleslaw I got coleslaw with very little pastrami. I tried to call and complain and couldn't get through until the fifth call when I was asked to hold and was hung up on. Bad sandwich!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good chain sandwich shop! I will say that Togos is my number one but this is right up there, definitely beats subway by a mile!

I had the Bobbie which was amazing! The only thing I would have changed is to have it warmed up. The staff was very helpful and really nice that I will go back to this location every time."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!!! Excellent service every time and the sandwiches are amazing!!! Love the tuna... Which is amazing because I normally cannot stand Tuna. They have so many yummy choices can't wait to try them all!!!"}
{"text":"CAPASTRAMI! DO IT, DO IT! this sandwich was all i hoped for after reading the rave reviews from the yelpers. Tasty loads of pastrami nestled in a perfect bun by itself would be just fine for me. BUT, they through a heaping helping of coleslaw on top and it becomes decadence in your hand. I loved it. Unfortunately my wife got the cole turkey and hated it. I tasted it and it just tasted like tuna salad to me, not my fav. 
CAPASTRAMI is the way to go for sure, i'll be back next time i roll through Vegas for sure. 

PS..I do hate when restaurants don't have fountain drinks, it's cheap and lame."}
{"text":"This is the first time I walked into a restaurant I know I enjoy the food at, saw h the employees working and asked for my money back, one girl was drinking a soda while trying to take an order, one was playing with her clothes with gloves on then handling food, saw someone take money with gloves on then walk right over to preparation line and handle food. Saw someone that was making sandwiches bring an order to a table with their gloves on and not change them or wash hands before preparing another order. This behavior is unacceptable in a restaurant,"}
{"text":"Ordered roast beef with extra mayo. Got barely any mayo. Bread was dry. Cashier is always real friendly. Quick service but quick service is only good when what is ordered is made how you wanted it."}
{"text":"great place to eat but they don't have a public bathroom Maybe next time I have to go use one at anther restaurant might just eat their instead"}
{"text":"I have now been to this sandwich shop twice. I was pleased both times, with two different sandwiches. They tasted fresh, and had a good amount of meat on them. Which is more than I can say about a majority of sandwich shops in and around town. Also, prices are fair for what you get. I will go back."}
{"text":"The sandwich platter that we got was like Thanksgiving wrapped into a bun. Turkey, Stuffing and Cranberry. It was great. 4 Stars LV a truly exceptional sandwich."}
{"text":"I learned about Capriotti's when I was here in 2012 for the Yelp Elite Spring Break event.  I spoke to one of the owner reps and he gave me a free sandwich card for me to use the next time I come back into town!  Sweet!

When I did eventually go back later that year, I lost the card(doh!) but I still went to get a sandwich here.  Personally out of all the sandwiches I tried, I personally like the Bobbie the best which is turkey, cranberry, and stuffing.  I also had tried the Capastrami and the SlawBe Joe which was pastrami and roast beef respectively.  However, both of these sandwiches have cole slaw in them...not a sandwich that can keep for a couple of days.  I ate half of the Bobbie the day I ordered it and ate the rest the next day without refrigeration.  Still tasted good!  Any sandwich that can taste as good as the day you bought it, wins oodles of points in my book.  

This location in the Town Square is very convenient and located upstairs from the Coffee Bean."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are generally pretty good here. Unfortunately, they are wrapped so tight that they look like a pretzel. All twisted and smashed.  The last time I got a cheesesteak, I brought it back to my condo, opened it up and meat went everywhere.  The bread was smashed and torn. It looked like someone kicked it around the floor.  I drove back to Capriotti's and asked for a replacement. The manager asked me why I didn't want to eat that one.  He acted like that is what the sandwich should have looked like.  I told him to keep the sandwich and left.  Went to hogans by PTs. It was a lot better"}
{"text":"What is the deal....the last few times have been less than stellar....put some meat that isn't gristle on the cheesesteaks....think u lost a customer, and what's worse is you can't find a decent cs in this town as it is...."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches. Meats and toppings appear to be fresh and tasty. Great service. Always attentive to your needs. In fact I've never been treated nicer at a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"If you've never has Capriotti's, I will now shed a single tear for you.

Ok, now that that's done, get off of your butt, away from your computer, go to a Capriotti's location, and get yourself a Bobbie.  Fresh bread; turkey; stuffing; cranberry sauce.  Pure thanksgiving delight on a bun at any time of the year.  What in the world is not amazing about that?  If that doesn't sound like your bag (you giant freak of person, who the hell ARE you?), you can try one of their other specialties like a Capistrami (pastrami, cole slaw, swiss, and Russian dressing) or the Slaw-Be Jo (same, but with roast beef).  Or you can get pretty much any sub your pretty little head desires.  Some locations even deliver.  This must mean rapture is near.

What are you doing still reading?  Go get yourself a sandwich, skinny!"}
{"text":"Capastrami. Bobbie. These are 2 names forever burned into my mind after spending my bachelor weekend here in Vegas. I had heard whispers and chatter about this place for years, but never took the plunge until my best man (I knew I picked the right man for the job) pulled the trigger and made it happen for us.  Best. Choice. Ever.

We ate here twice during our 2 days in Vegas. That's how freakin' good this place is, considering the plethora of good eats choices the city has. 

Seriously, do you go to a seafood restaurant and order the steak and complain because it sucks? I don't care if their other sammiches aren't up to par or whatever. You come here for the Capastrami and the Bobbie because those are their marquee items, right?

Capastrami: Their bread is soft, pastrami is thick, yet tender, cole slaw is tangy and creamy with that Russian dressing. Between the 2, this sandwich wins, hands down.

Bobbie:  The turkey is moist, the cranberry sauce is not overpowering, and the stuffing is the glue that binds everything all together. Thanksgiving dinner in a bun. 

Get the large, ask them to cut it up for you, then split and enjoy with your friends. That's your best bet in terms of food to money ratio. For sure, one of the few places in Vegas you'll come away a winner every time."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and it was great each time. Service is the best, the inside is clean, and the food is always good. The salads are so fresh and they will add extra items if you ask. Not your average Capriati's. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for sandwiches this weekend and couldn't have been happier with our choices.  I tried the Bobbie with no mayo - felt like Thanksgiving all over again - with a side of chicken noodle soup and my husband had the cheesesteak and a fresh chocolate chip cookie.  The staff was really welcoming and fun and the food was good.  I can only imagine what this place is like at 3am on a weekend!"}
{"text":"These sandwiches are yummylicious. Seriously. The bread is toasted just right. Ingredients are well flavored!! The service is great. Overall I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars simply because the prices are a bit high. They have 3 sizes of bags of chips and each one is crazy expensive. My advice is to buy your chips at home. Even their drinks are pricey. The sandwiches are well worth the price though they are a tiddy bit $$$ also. If you have not tried this place, you gotta go! Its so flavorful. Just know that for a sandwich shop u will have to pay a pretty penny to get a good meal."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and soups are times die for. The prices for a sandwich shop are a bit higher than you may expect but they deliver great food and service. If ur on blue diamond, swing by you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. All I gotta say is they are way better than subway sandwich!!

They have 3 sizes of sandwich bread, the largest being 20 inch.. Right next to movie theater. Chicken sandwich real good. I did not give them the five star because they only have one kind of bread which is white bread.  Tell them BigDaddy sent u..!!"}
{"text":"I really love the variety that Capriottis offers, especially with their focus on using Thanksgiving-esque ingredients in their selections. The Cran Slam club is an unbeliveably delicious combination of ham, turkey and cranberry sauce that I would recommend hands-down as the number 1 menu item to anyone giving Capriottis a shot for the first time.

Honestly I haven't been blown away by the more standard menu items (I've had a tuna sandwich and turkey sub that were both so-so) but the Capriottis originals more than make up for the less spectacular alternatives."}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for several years from a friend, but never tried it until today. Don't make the same mistake I did. Go here next time you want a REAL sandwich. REAL MEAT, not some roll of pressed stuff. My FRESH TURKEY SUB was great. The bread was good, and not to doughy. The pepper relish gave it a great zing. The prices are very fair for a sandwich made with real meat. This is now regular fast food sub shop sandwich.

I am looking forward to trying several things on the menu here. The THANKSGIVING Bobbi looks good.  I'll be back...

My old favorite at AZ Sandwich company, who have been screwing up my orders lately, may not see me for a while."}
{"text":"I greatly appreciate the sandwich creations with roasted turkey, not processed turkey.
We've tried many items in the menu. We've never been disappointed. 
Freshly-prepared sandwiches shall keep us coming back. Double YUM!!!"}
{"text":"I gave 1 star because i cant leave a 0. When i came at night the whole place smelled like weed and everyone was rude and seemed like they didnt want to work there. There was loud banging of pots and stuff in the back and lots of curse words. I would never go back to this location."}
{"text":"OMG. Just realized that Capriotti's delivers to my Camelback office. Happy happy joy joy! 

Delivery was quick and priced right. The Bobby was awesome (as always - best. sammich. ever!) and I really enjoyed the brownie."}
{"text":"OMG.

Not only is everyone SUPER nice, but the sandwich is THE BEST I've EVER had in my life. And trust me when i say this, I've eaten A LOT of sandwiches!! 

I had the chicken/mushroom cheese steak with all toppings (hot pepper, sweet pepper, lettuce, tomato, pickles) It came out steaming hot and the flavor is UN-describably AWESOME. Oh my and that bread. 

My husband had the hot pastrami and that too was simply melt in your mouth amazing. 

I am so happy that my husband found this place in the Vegas book that he got, other wise, I wouldn't even know it existed. I have to say though, that I am a little upset now because ever since I had this sandwich, ive been craving it NON STOP.

Capriotti's why not open a few in San Francisco Bay Area? You can even hire me and I will be your #1 representative. Please? Maybe? Will you think about it? 

Well, there's one in LA that we can go too, but now i have to wait salivating for a few months until we go to LA!!

Wow, thank you!! Please go. You will not, and i mean WILL NOT be disappointed. And if you are, contact me, and I will seriously give you a back handed slap across the face.

Great prices too!!!!"}
{"text":"Normally I like this place. Today I walk in to buy lunch for the family and at the end of the order I'm told no kids drinks then I'm told the Pepsi machine is broke so she offers mildly cool bottles only while pointing at the  cooler. I ask if they have ice and of course  the answer is no. Terrible! I write this as I'm waiting for my steak and cheese sub to come out at Firehouse subs on Maryland by UNLV. $50 sale lost"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving came early for me!  I got the medium Bobbi!  In between got extra mayo, stuffing, turkey, cranberry.  Little to heavy on the cranberry note to self ez on the cranberry next time.  The size of this sandwich was hugeeee!  Enough for 3/4 people,  but I ate the whole thing lol service was quick and on point."}
{"text":"I love a good sandwich and Capriotti's is my go-to when I'm in the mood for one, but after my visit on 7/6/2017, I'm not sure that I'll be visiting this location in the future.

After a long day, I was craving my fav Chicken Cheese Steak with the works for dinner. It was about 7:30 and I decided to check Yelp to make sure they were still open before I left my house. This location, like most Capriotti's, closes at 9 pm except for Sunday. Great! I pulled up at 8 pm exactly and immediately noticed all the bar stools already placed on the counter. If you're familiar with this location, you know that there is very limited seating space, so it's always best to take your sandwich to-go! 

I got out of the car and double checked the posted hours on the door. It clearly says 9 pm, just like Yelp! Still confused, I walked into the empty Capriotti's and an employee walked out from the back. She told me they were still open and proceeded to take my order. I also used my CAPAddicts Rewards app to redeem a free medium drink and small bag of chips. Why not! I walked to the soda machine and the lemonade was not dispensing. I thought that the lemonade spout was broken, but none of the other drinks were dispensing either. It turns out the machine was completely shut off. She had to turn the machine back on with a key. This is what really ticked me off! 

Really? The shop was completely shut down one whole hour before posted closing time! I find that completely unacceptable and not professional at all. Getting ready to shut down 15 minutes prior to closing seems more appropriate, but one hour? Not cool!

Two stars because my sandwich was still A1! If it wasn't for that, I would've definitely given this location one star based solely on this visit."}
{"text":"Arrived 30 min before closing. Guys working were friendly & fixed sandwich quickly. Mushroom cheese steak great as usual."}
{"text":"Capriottis has many delicious subs. I know there are alot of \"Bobbie\" fans out there but I must say I prefer the capastrami.  The coleslaw on the hot grilled pastrami with extra 1000 and melted swiss is absolutly amazing.  

I had the \"Slaw be Jo\" last time and I remebewr this sandwich being hot.  This go around It was cold roast beef and to be honest I was very dissapointed. Just my opinion.  You can never go wrong with a \"Philly\" from here."}
{"text":"I love capriottis but usually go to downtown Summerlin location the turkey here was so dry got my sandwich order wrong and kids sandwich turkey and bread was extremely dry and fucking disgusting the employees were not helpful at all and were retarded more worried about pick up order instead of the customers eating in."}
{"text":"It's rare that one recalls a sandwich five months after it has been eaten but this place made it. Excellent rolls (don't get me started), great seasoning and superior meats - made me feel like I was back in the 'burg in Trenton at one of the little Italian places. Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"You gotta try the VEGGIE BOBBIE (yes I sorta created myself) ... And if you get it on Whole wheat it makes the fake turkey taste even better for some Odd reason... No it's not vegan because they still have regular mayo but its a great way to eat somewhat healthy with the without the meat guild and the same pleasure of that yummy thanksgiving flavor!  The fake turkey isn't on the menu for all the choices but i'm sure they will replace it with anything you ask. :)"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever!! The cap n Bobbie are simply fantastic.  One star off for very uncomfortable and poorly thought out seating. Take it to go, the inside is horrible for eating."}
{"text":"This is probably the 3rd time i've been here in the past 2 weeks and even though their food is great, the manager or whoever does scheduling is horrible at what they do. 

First of all, even during the lunch rush, there's only TWO people working. Literally all three times I have been here, i see only 2 people working, while there's a restaurant full of hungry, hot, and impatient people. I don't know if the owner's just trying to lower his expenses or if he really has no idea that they're losing customers from the lack of staff, but they need to change that asap.

Second, I know it's supposed to be a small sandwich shop and all, but whoever did the layout for this store really screwed up. The register is way too close to the front door and sometimes the line is out the door - in the 100+ degree weather. Not smart. 

Today, I finally got my food after about 35 mins from when I ordered it, even though the cashier told me that it would take 15-20 minutes. A very angry customer asked for his refund after waiting such a long time for his order, and my boyfriend and I were very close to joining him in his complaints.

I wouldn't say I wouldn't come again, because i love their Philly Cheese Steaks, but I really do hate their lack of staff."}
{"text":"Not only do all Capriotti's have amazing sandwiches but this location is even more on-point than others I've been to.

Very clean and new feeling. They also have extras I'm not used to seeing (soup, different sandwich options).

The staff was very friendly and we got out order fast."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of Capriotti's but apparently I'm the only one 

I can't knock the customer service or cleanliness of this location because both are great

Maybe it's just one of those things that I have to have multiple times to finally love"}
{"text":"Maybe good by Vegas standards, but LA has spoiled me.  The sandwiches are adequate, but nothing WoWed me.  I'll try once more perhaps, before I render my final verdict.

I'll say its good in a pinch, when you're looking for something other than a burger."}
{"text":"Got a really good cheesesteak sandwich here! I would definitely recommend it and can't wait to get it again!!!"}
{"text":"Never again going to #Capriottis in Southern Highlands.  My veggie cheese steak had pastrami in it!  Luckily I always check my food before eating it.  When we went in to return it and get a refund (because I was NOT about to have them make me another one!) they say \"oh yeah that must be from the spatula, I just wipe it off\"!  WTF are you kidding me?!? How many other times have you fed me dead animals!?!?  #beyondfurious #wtfcapriottis #disgusted"}
{"text":"I really like Capriotti's, I have tried them throughout the city. This was the worst one I have been too. The gentleman that took our order didn't have much of a personality, until I started joking with him, the restaurant was filthy. We were there during an off time, and most of the tables were dirty, the soda and tea machine area was disgusting.  The floors had food and trash on them. After they brought our sandwiches I looked back in the area where they make the sandwiches and if I would have seen that before ordering I would have left. This store needs a new staff or supervision and new training. It will be a long time before I step back into this location."}
{"text":"This location is in a gas station. This is my 1st time eating here. The sub was average not bad not great. Prices were on the higher end for a sub place. I would rank mikes jersey subs above this place. Don't know if I would go back? Average sub but better then subway."}
{"text":"Holy Moses!!!! Best chicken cheesesteak I've ever had!!! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I always. Come to this location today she gave ME the worst Service its 6:32 p.m  take a hikes shorty you Just lost $10 tip"}
{"text":"This sandwich is what made this place famous and it's worth it to check it out. My Mom and brother all recommded this place when I moved back to LV 6 years ago. This Thanksgiving tasty sandwich filled with turkey that is cooked daily and then shredded down meets it's adverstised demand. I recommend to add lettuce and tomato and extra tomato as there is bread (the roll) on bread (the stuffing) action going on! The Capistrami is my second favorite very tasty with the Russian dressing gives a pastrami sandwich a nice twist."}
{"text":"I pretty much always get the capastrami. I never cared for coleslaw much until I had it with this sandwich. So good and filling :) service is always friendly and fast."}
{"text":"Definitely enjoyed my veggie sandwich and service was overall great! They really appreciate the tips they receive :-)"}
{"text":"This must be the new flagship of Capriotti's Sandwich Restaurants.  This place is beautiful! Digital menu board, modern pos system, several soups to choose from and salads on the menu.  This company has raised its own bar.  I could not believe that when I ordered my sandwich for dine in, it came out on a plate!!??. I have never seen a Caps sandwich plated....usually it comes out tightly rolled in butcher paper. 

This Summerlin location is reaching for new heights with the updated design and increased standards on food presentation and quality. Even the bread was fresher at this location.  The balsamic salad was also quite tasty with the dried cranberries, walnuts, blue cheese crumbles, over a bed of spring mix.  Very good salad! 

Overall this location was good. I like the new version of Capriotti's.  They are gonna do good things with one of the most delicious sandwiches year after year with the Bobbie and this new store design."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this is low rated on here as I've lived in the southern highlands area for the past 8 years and have frequently picked up food and dined here. The service is fast and friendly and the location is always clean. I've ordered the Bobby, cole turkey (turkey is always good which is important at all Capriottis), cold and warm Italian, cheese and chicken steak."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Caprio this and I must say it was a great one. I got their famous Bobby sandwich which is just like a thanksgiving dinner if you've never heard of it. It's reasonably priced for how good the sandwiches are."}
{"text":"My mom took me and my brother's family here a few days before Christmas this year. It was my first time trying it, and this place has the best sandwiches around! I definitely recommend coming here for lunch and/or dinner. If I were to have time one day, I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"First time customer and I would come back. The Bobbie sandwich was a good thanksgiving style sandwich but I did ask for more cranberry sauce because it was kinda dry. Clean shop and servers were really helpful :-)"}
{"text":"Re-visited on 11/12 and happy to report the place on 100% cleaner. They have either read reviews or invested in towels to wipe off the tables. 

And the pastrami was still just as delicious."}
{"text":"So I see all these negative reviews and, rather than deterring me from going back to Capriotti's, what are my thoughts? \"Great, shorter lines for me!\" Really, no joke.

Okay so in all fairness I only ever eat one thing here. Which never happens. Ever. Here though, I always get the Cran Slam Club, and it never, ever fails to satisfy. I think I may have tried something else at a different location years ago... but since I tried that club, there's been no going back.

Oh and to the person complaining about a limited selection of chips, quick tip: Go to the counter where you ordered...... look down. You're welcome. :-)"}
{"text":"I'm pleased to see that Capriotti's has so many glowing reviews, which means I don't have to feel as bad about this bad boy. 

Long story short: I ate there once I didn't like it. I ate there again, adding my own veganaise and vegan cheese to their veggie turkey sub and loved it. I ordered for a third time today. 

Or actually my coworker ordered for me, which actually has some bearing on this story as you will see. I was prepared to go completely apoplectic on this Yelp but instead I'll try to keep calm and just say why I think it's a one-starer.

My coworker ordered me a large fake turkey sub. How do I know this with 100% certainty? I listened to her call. I have it recorded. We record every call. Trust me, there are good reasons to do this. Your business should too. 

Anyway, so I listen back to the call and here's what happened. She said, may I please have a fake turkey sub with no cheese and no mayo. When he repeated it back to her, he said \"Turkey\" but because he also said mayo she corrected him on that and didn't reiterate the VEGGIE turkey. This sort of thing happens in the world. No harm, no foul. 

However, this is important because when I brought it up that my mother fucking TWELVE DOLLAR sub was turkey, he basically said, \"well that's what you ordered.\" I trust my coworker but, upon her recommendation, I decided to listen to see where the communication break down occurred. I wish there was a way to embed the call in here. 

So at this point believe it or not I was still being pretty rational and I'm like no biggie. I'll just tell him. This fucking thing is unopened. Surely someone will order a Turkey in the next ten minutes... 

Instead he basically said too bad so sad. So my eyes bulge and he's feeling like an asshole and says if I want to wait around he'll make me a new one. No fucking thanks. I get it."}
{"text":"The sign says voted the greatest sandwich in America. I thought it was one of the worst I have ever had. I didn't care for it the first time but thought I would give it a second chance. That was a mistake. Just an ordinary sandwich, nothing special. I have been to dives that can make a better sandwich that that."}
{"text":"Everything was hot, fast and fresh. The staff was amazing and friendly. We are never dissapointed with the cheese steak and capastrami."}
{"text":"Customer service is why I'm rating so high. Demetrius was super cool, really attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Great. Just ate at the one in scottsdale downtown and ordered a steak sandwich. I have a big appetite and the medium size was huge and just right. Good sandwich. I recommend. Now if they could make some cheese fries with gravy that would just be even better. hint"}
{"text":"I'm an east coaster and this place makes some bomb sandwiches.  The one with the turkey cranberries and stuffing remi ds me of the gobbler from Wawa back home."}
{"text":"First time here wanted a quick sandwich got a turkey on wheat made to order perfectly! Thanks Roger for EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"While waiting for my movie to start, I stopped here for a bite to eat. I'm a first timer at Capriotti's and not much of a sandwich person at that.

I ordered the most familiar thing on the menu --- cheese steak sandwich, plain. It came warm, cheesy, and oh so gooey. The quality of the meat and cheese were top notch. It was probably the best cheese steak sandwich I've had; I think it is a lot better than Subway's version. 

I thought it was kind of pricey though --- $11 for a small drink and a 9\" sub. This was in a casino though, so I'm not sure how the prices compare to a standalone shop. I'm not a sandwich person, but I'll probably stop by on another occasion."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Red Rock last week and ate here twice, alongside recommending it to quite a few other people who enjoyed it as well.

The 5-star rating is for the cheesesteak I had with hot and sweet peppers, which was just about perfect. Pillowy bread, tender steak, and melty cheese served so fresh and hot I had to be careful not to burn myself with how much I wanted to keep taking more bites.

My wife had a Bobbie and I also tried the meatball sub, both of which were good but no where near how good that cheesesteak was."}
{"text":"Walked in. No employees. Waited. Waited. Waited. Finally walked around the corner and they're in the back playing on their phones. Asked for help and they were extremely short with their answers. Not helpful. Walked away without food"}
{"text":"Really great place to eat, fresh food only reason I put 4 stars is that I think it's kinda pricey"}
{"text":"This review is based off everything about the company since I used to work there. I've worked for a corporate location and one franchises. This is the franchised location I worked at. Delete if this isn't allowed but here's my opinion. 

Knowing about how fresh everything is makes it better for me. I know what I'm eating and he quality. I still go here all the time. I always get the best service, always the best sandwiches (my favorite is the Cran Slam Club on a roll with extra mayo or an Italian with extra mayo, no tomatoes, American instead of provolone, black olives, pickles, and vinegar.) this is one amazing company and I hope one day when I'm visiting Manhattan I can walk down the street and see this store on every corner. Thank you Capriotti's for treating me right as a former employee and now a capaddict! Stay as amazing as you are!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I haven't written a review for this place. Let me start off by saying that yes I have worked for this company twice in the past so if removing my review is necessary, that's okay with me. I did not work at this location though. I lived at Boulevard at 4201 for a year so this was the location that I went to all the time. Their cheesesteaks were really good, but I wish there were more patties in there. Yes I know if you pay more I can get some but I feel like it's not enough and shouldn't have to pay for that and that it should just come with it. My favorite is their cran slam club, but I get it on a roll instead of white bread! Also I get it with extra mayo. Or the Italian sandwich with american instead of provolone, no tomato, extra extra mayo, spicy mustard, pickles, and black olives. It's amazing. The guys at this location are really nice too!"}
{"text":"What can I say? Been going to one location or another for probably 15 years (give or take). Always delicious, always fast service. Sometimes you just crave a cappistrami."}
{"text":"This was horrible. I've never waited 20 minutes for a STUPID SANDWICH!!!! 2 dudes behind the counter and it was 25 minutes from the time i walked in til the time i walked out, not busy at all."}
{"text":"The bobbie is delicious.  If you like thanksgiving, this is the whole meal in one sandwich.

Not a huge fan of their philly cheesesteak although it wasn't bad.  Just nothing to come here for.

This is the best location from the strip.  Right across from the Hard Rock Casino."}
{"text":"You probably have to check the closing time of your shop it says open till 8pm but when we called to order for pick up at around 6:45 pm there was an eternal busy tone like the phone was hung from its hook so we tried around 4 times still the same. Starting to think that this was done on purpose  so no one could reach the number for services.
So on the fifth time, someone answered the line so we can place an order at around 6:55 pm. The male employee mentioned that they ran out of buns because they got a heavy catering or to go order- ran out of buns on a weekend? 
Went to the gas station across it to fill up gas with the intent of dropping by personally to buy sandwiches but saw that the employees were leaving as they closed the lights and doors.
Yes, the team has to go home - was this acceptable to you to pre- close on a Saturday?
The fact is the closing should be at 8 pm as stated in this yelp ad. If there were any changes then please update and do justice for your own sake.
Would completely understand but this was not the first time it happened, one time they ran  out of meat for the Philly cheesesteaks.
Overall impression it didn't give a positive image for the reason stated above.
Your management team needs to look into this concern and to stock up heavy in the fast/ essential moving items to cope up with the popular demands especially on a weekend."}
{"text":"Every time I've gone to this location, I've been greeted, and taken care of right away! Food is great! My wife had the Capastrami, and I had the philly cheese steak sandwich. They don't use cheese wiz like they do in Philly, but it's a pretty good sandwich nonetheless."}
{"text":"After taking a few days of vacation in this area,  I yelped around for good food, this place popped up.  After the all the hype reviews of the Capastrami sandwich,  I had to try it.  I ordered a medium sized sandwich which is 12\" which came out $9.35 tax included . The sandwich comes with a generous amount of pastrami with coleslaw and some type of dressing.  First couple bites,  I was like wow, this shit is great!!  Now everytime I visit Vegas I will be hitting this place for sure and call ahead,  because sandwich is made to order!"}
{"text":"Needed a little something after our show so we could power through the night.  I was happy to see this place as it hit the spot perfectly.  Had to go with The Bobby and just like back home, it was excellent!"}
{"text":"Love the food!  However the staff falls short every time.  This place is in need of a manager to really oversee the day to day activities.  Orders are constantly wrong and sometimes very slow.  Last time were visited, it took 30 minutes to get our order.

Too bad as the food is so damn good!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the cleanliness, not the food quality. I will say this, this location is a CESSPOOL, filthy as hell. I believe the owner of this location owns the one on E. Sunset & Stephanie St. at least that is what a few of  the employees told me, because I commented on how dirty the place was. I asked who the owner was, they wouldn't tell me their name, but mentioned the other locations. Shame on you, I don't mind paying 9 dollars for a great sandwhich, but clean the damn shit hole place up!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love a good sandwich. Soft hoagie bread, premium deli meats, melted cheese, and delicious sauces - what's not to love?

My girlfriend talked about Capriotti's as one of the best sandwich shops in town. Like most great sandwich shops I have been to, there isn't much to see in the shop. But that's okay - the magic happens behind the scenes. I ordered a large (12\") capastrami sandwich. Grilled pastrami, swiss cheese, and russian dressing. Pretty simple, but super delicious. A word of warning: this is not a Katz thick cut pastrami sandwich, so if that is your expectation you would be disappointed. This is very thin sliced and minced pastrami. I like both styles, and his works for me."}
{"text":"I love this place. I tried it after reading all the posting on YELP!. I was looking for a place I can eat at off the Vegas strip. Their sandwiches are amazing. If you are in the area, you should really check them out. It was worth the 2 mile walk in the HOT sun!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. We tried to place a to-go order tonight on the way there at 7:30. They close at 8. We were told that they wouldn't take our order and if we showed up they would lock the door. Then they hung up on us. I wish I had read the reviews on Yelp and Facebook first as other reviewers have had the same experience.  Save yourself the trouble and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"There were a few sandwiches on the menu that looked appetizing, but I went with the small cheese steak sandwich. Good choice - quality meat and tasty cheese and onions, on a delicious roll. The bread could have been a bit warmer - I love fresh-baked bread - but it was pretty fresh.

I've heard the Bobbie is supposed to be amazing - Thanksgiving in a sandwich. I'll try that next time."}
{"text":"This relatively small chain of sandwich shops serves up some very good sandwiches.

The \"cran slam\" is a known favorite.

Wide selection from veggie to both hot and cold- all very fresh."}
{"text":"I've tried the capastrami and the cole turkey, both are delicious!  They don't use sliced turkey on their sandwiches, they use shredded roasted turkey breast which is very nice.  It is a little bit pricey but the portions are huge compared to other sandwich places so it evens out.  You can definitely get two meals out of one small sub.

The staff is also very nice.  One time I had to wait for them to make a new batch of coleslaw to complete my sandwich and the manager offered me a free drink for having to wait so long."}
{"text":"Allow me to begin by saying that my family members and I work at a business within walking distance of this Capriotti's.  We have always LOVED Capriotti's in general, but there is definitely something SYSTEMICALLY wrong with this location, as nothing but inferior products have been turned out.  We've given this location MULTIPLE chances over a span of 11 years.  Enough is enough.

I think this nearly $6 turkey sandwich which looks like it was sat upon says more than any words I might have.

I'm far from cheap, and I know the price of good food!  I'll gladly pay $6 for a kick-butt turkey sandwich, but not this turkey-who-got-his-butt-kicked-in sandwich.  What an embarrassment to the Capriotti's chain!"}
{"text":"I happen to like he foo but at this particular location they are so rude! The customer service is non existent. I walked in to an empty place for lunch 20 minutes ago and waited by the register for 10 minutes for someone to help me. 4 employees behind the counter watching one employees show off his spatula skills in the air. No one came over to me to ask \"may I help you\"? Until I started to walk out. Needless to say, I kept walking. They really failed!"}
{"text":"Got the 20' philly with everything on it. I was skeptical at first because of the price but then when I received it I was feeling less weary. When I ate it it was worth every penny. They definitely serve great portions and customer service was great as well."}
{"text":"The sandwich was great.  But this little side story was really quite annoying.  I bought a bottled soda at this place (in addition to the sandwich) and, after paying, went over to the refrigerator and discovered that the fridge had no refrigeration. All bottled drinks were very warm.  I then asked for a cup for ice, and she said \"I'm going to have to charge for that.\"  I told her the fridge was out and she said \"yeah I know.\"  And then she stared at me blankly.   I simply walked away.  I thought this was ridiculous, when she was aware that the refrigerator was out.  Maybe it's a company rule. But not very persuasive under the circumstances."}
{"text":"This place was terrible we waited over 45 minutes for 2 sandwiches and when I asked where my sandwiches were the girl at the register gave me crazy attitude and slammed my sandwiches down on the counter and put her hand out for payment without even telling me the total! Very rude! I will never be back!"}
{"text":"This place has fhe best subs around. The staff is always very nice and usually pretty fast. I eat a bobbie every week, and lets just say, its usually the highpoint of my monday. LOL"}
{"text":"Welp! Just got a new favorite sandwich place. Veggie \"faux\" turkey for the win. My my my what can I say other than simply delicious. You will wait on your sandwich though so be prepared. Gourmet sandwiches, great prices. 4 stars just because the convenience of calling in should be not to wait. Literally they made the sandwich as I came in and mentioned I already paid."}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmm I simply love this place. I've gotten tuna subs and veggie turkeys. I have nothing but positive things to say. First time at this location and the staff is super friendly and restaurant very clean. Of course I will be back!"}
{"text":"Well....tried this place again....hoping it wouldn't be as bad as the last time!  And it actually was even worse!  The kids that work here are always yelling \"Beer Money\"!  And they aren't even old enought to drink!!!  The place was so filthy...that I should of just walked back out!  The tables are absolutely disgusting!  Every single one of them were covered in a sticky dirty bacteria infested grime!!!  And the floor!!! OMG!!!  I wouldn't even let my dog walk on it if I had to!  It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in  months!!!  And lets not forget about the 20\" Bobbie I ordered to go!  These kids in here are so unprofessional...and act like they don't have a clue as to why they are standing there!!!  I told the kid....Extra mayo, cranberries and easy on the stuffing....as I would like to taste the turkey...not just a stuffing sandwich!  Well...thats exactly what I ended up with!  The 20\" roll was so dry and hard...that you seriously couldn't even eat it!  There was about a tablespoon of cranberries on it....so little mayo that I couldn't even see it!  And Filled with stuffing and barely any turkey!!!  This is the second time I went to this location....which is why I was very clear and specific how I wanted my $14 sandwich!  It was absolutely pathetic!  I've been to other Capriotti's...and they were nothing like this one!  These kids are completely clueless.  And management are obviously a bunch of idiots!!!  If the health department came in this place....they would shut them down!!!!  This place is horrible!!!  They don't even deserve 1 star!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh it hurts so good. By hurts I mean the inevitable stomach ache you'll get if you inhale a 12inch hot sandwich in under ten minutes, but maybe that's just me. I really wanted to try something different this time, but if it ain't broke don't fix it. Capastrami FTW! My friend did get the Philly Cheesesteak however and I tried a bite of that, and it was BOMB. I have a confession, I've never actually had a philly cheesesteak, of any kind, anywhere, so I don't think these are super traditional but it was super flavorful, tender, and a little bit spicy from the peppers and onions. If for any reason someone told me I couldn't eat pastrami and coleslaw, I'd get that FO SHO."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is the best sandwich place in town they would be rated a 10 where subway and quiznos are 1's and 2's. capriotti's is so good to go and get a good sandwich i would recommend the Bobbie or the cheese steak sandwiches. The sandwiches are about 8 to 10 for normal sizes and you get what you  pay for. check this place out and enjoy."}
{"text":"Employees rude AF!!!  Food was ok.. Eating area  always dirty, I don't even know why I gave them my business again"}
{"text":"That guy Christian was so nice and helpful! I ended up getting a Cran Slam Club on a roll and it was delicious! I also love the area and will be back!"}
{"text":"This location sucks terrible customer service and sloppy slandwhiches its also pretty dirty in the lobby. Won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Across the street from South Point Hotel & Casino, this sandwich shop is as good as it gets!  I happened to be staying in South Las Vegas and had the pleasure of treating my British friends to these incredibly delicious and superfresh homemade sandwiches.   The Slaw-Be-Jo was TDF!!  They are huge and well-priced.  No matter where you are in Vegas, this sandwich shop is worth the drive.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"Just not very clean. After seeing the restroom, my appetite disappeared. Nastiest restroom I've seen in a very long time. The service absolutely sucks. They didnt even care when i told them about their restroom conditions."}
{"text":"Meh...not too impressed. This is no east coast sandwich shop. I wouldn't say the food is bad, but I'd go elsewhere if I wanted a real grinder."}
{"text":"Honesty, I don't know anything about the food here, but your sign twirler is awesome! I was entertained while waiting at the stop light. I will definitely try a sandwich soon!"}
{"text":"Move over Subway, Togo's..etc. There's a new boy in town! CAPRIOTTI'S!! This is THEE go to sub place for everyone! It has your colds, hots, and vegs. The Bobby is hands down the BEST sandwich! Give me a minute (as my eyes roll back) it's filling, thick, oozes with stuffing and turkey. I've tried their other sandwiches, but this one is the best. For under $13 you can get a 20\" sandwich, I mean seriously, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Their food is always very good, that is not the issue. This locations is a shit hole. It is so filthy and gross, if it were not for the fact that I was starving and the guy wore gloves so that I could watch him cook my meal, I would have left. Many of the Capriotti's need to get their acts together wtih cleanliness, namingly: Capriotti's near Anthem, E. Sunset Rd.and Stephanie St. Cesspools, everyone of them and I think that they are all the same owner. Shame on you all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is always great and the staff is very nice, however, this place is a shit hole. What a cesspool. It is so filthy in this place, I go sometimes if I am starving.Thank God you can watch these guys cook your food, if that was not the case, I would never return. Many of the Capriotti's are filth pits, shame on them."}
{"text":"YUMMM!

After reading the reviews on yelp, I decided to go here since its right outside the neighborhood. I got the bobbie, capistrami, and the cheesesteak. I sampled each one and my favorite was hands down the capistrami. The other sandwiches did not disappoint either and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's but this is the only location that I have had problems with. I have been here twice: first time the cashier wasn't friendly and my bobby was mostly mayo. Second time my bobby had small pieces of bone!"}
{"text":"Have you heard of Capriottis I \"innocently\" asked a friend who happens to be a Vegas local. When he eagerly responded with just the words \"THE BOBBIE\" I knew I'd be sinking my teeth into one of these famous sandwiches very shortly, and in fact it was just the next morning. 

He got the Bobbie, which really does taste like thanksgiving on a bun. Homemade roll, freshly cooked shredded turkey breast, cranberry sauce, and stuffing. I only had a bite but instantly understood why there are so many yelps talking about it. I got the Slaw Bi Jo, same fresh bread, fresh roast beef that was shredded instead of sliced, crispy cool cole slaw and provolone. The whole thing was delicious, I struggled to appear ladylike and bite it, when all I really wanted to do was mash it all the way into my mouth! The ladylike appearance only became harder to maintain, when the last person in our group received their cooked to order \"cheeseburger sub\" YES cheeseburger Sub! I realize the words sound funny together but believe me the sandwich is awesome! The cheeseburger is restaurant quality, and they will top it the way you want it, you can even ask for grilled onions. 

The whole experience was so good we decided to grab one for the road on our way out of Vegas, this time I tried the yelp infamous \"capistrami\" It was good, its served hot with the aforementioned crispy cool cole slaw, and melted swiss. I love pastrami, and enjoyed it, but in the end I wished I had gone with the slaw bijo, that roast beef was just so different and so tasty! 

The sandwiches come in three sizes 9 inches, 12 inches, and 20 inches, the prices are more than reasonable, your meal should run you around 10 bucks. 

Last note they had mini \"nothing bundt cakes\" cakes for sale, I've heard so much about them, and seen them in so many magazines I had to try one. Just like Capriottis, there reputation is well deserved. The mini chocolate cake was moist and rich and I was immediately smitten with it. 9 inches of pastrami and 1 mini bundt cake might have been to much, maybe even made me a little sick, but I didn't regret it at all!"}
{"text":"Great food but not a great location. The sandwiches are great, for east coaster's they have Tasty Cakes, and the service is pretty prompt - but the restaurant is just so SMALL. I came in with four friends and had to stand for 20 minutes for a table to clear out. We left one table to grab our sandwich and another patron swooped in and took it! My advice is to get it to go."}
{"text":"Found this chain when passing through Vegas on tour and it has become my favourite, it's hard finding quick and cheap vegetarian food on the road and their faux chicken cheesesteak blew my mind and now it's all I can think about. Huge sandwich for the price, lasts for ages and super satisfying. I thought it was just a Vegas thing but just found out there is ONE Capriottis in LA, taunting me, so will be heading there asap."}
{"text":"went on a tuesday, 11:15a.  waited 9 minutes for a bobbi sandwich
($6.50+tax).  the person before was getting fustrated when he went up to pay.  seems like he had waited a while too.  the register had gone down.  pay by cash only said the cashier.  as for the sandwich, was a nine incher, shredded turkey with cranbery sauce.  was good.  i may go again, maybe."}
{"text":"i'm only giving them a one star because I have to it was disappointing to have to go back a second time for my lunch being that I'm a barber and my time is limited as well as my breaks I ordered a small cole Turkey and didn't notice until my next break which was two hours later that it was a vegan sandwich.
Same order I asked for coleslaw on the side which that's what it says on the receipt and still received a side of Russian dressing they made the correction for that I didn't know I would've had to check my sandwich as well because small and vegan do not even sound the same or alike.  I will continue taking my business to Charleston location and flamingo location"}
{"text":"Great subs, very nice staff and very clean.  Good job guys! Can't go wrong with the Italian or the bobby."}
{"text":"Couldn't tell you how it was.  Sign on door says Open 10:00am, by 10:15 I left because they still hadn't open the door while 3 of us waited outside wanting to give them our MONEY. Come on!"}
{"text":"The Staff was quick to make my sandwich and the place looked nice and clean. I didn't get to judge the experience eating there, but judging on the food alone, I give Capriotti's five stars for sure!!! I had the Bobbie and tasted (more like ate half of the second sandwich) the Cheese Steak sandwich. 

The Cheese Steak was on point! It's well seasoned, juicy thinly sliced steak, with cheese melted through out this delectable sandwich. If you love Thanksgiving food like I do, you'll love the Bobbie sandwich as well! It's thinly sliced turkey (both white and dark meat), homemade stuffing with homemade whole-berry cranberry sauce! Personally, I'll be asking for extra cranberry sauce so there's a bit in every bite. The sweetness of the cranberry sauce is perfectly balanced with the turkey and stuffing. The bread held up perfectly and so yummy, too! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was on town attending a convention at a nearby hotel and didn't want to pay $16 for a salad at the lobby cafe, so I strolled around the corner to try this yelpy favorite!

My curiosity was piqued by the \"Bobbie\" - a thanksgiving themed creation of \"Homemade Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing, and Mayo,\" but then I spotted a slightly more familiar combination of ingredients in the signature Capastrami Sandwich - Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw. Loved it!! Delicious and slightly messy, the Combination of bread, meat and tangy sweetness was just right for my lunch cravings.

Tip for first-timers: They take your order first and ring you up when it's ready, so just waltz up to the counter where the chips are see the friendly sammich-jockey there to order.

Oh. And size does matter: The \"small\" Capastrami is easily 10-12\" and was plenty for me! The large must be a colossus!!"}
{"text":"This is our one must stop food place in Vegas every time we come out.

We always get the Capastrami sandwich, which is by far, the most delicious pastrami sandwich you'll have! 

My other favorite, which actually I may like more than the pastrami even, is the Bobbie. It's like Thanksgiving Heaven in a sandwich!! 

The sandwiches are made to order, and always fresh and tasty. The prices are pretty good too.

I'd like to try other stuff on the menu, but we can never seem to not order the Capastrami and the Bobbie!"}
{"text":"Food is always good, but a 20 minute wait is ridiculous. They need to improve efficiency or hire more people."}
{"text":"These sandwiches rock! The bobby is one of the best I've ever had. The ingredients are always fresh and you can't beat the taste."}
{"text":"Walked in at 1:53, stood at the counter for 5 minutes before even being acknowledged. 

My order was was finally taken and the guy apologized.

Several minutes later, another couple of people walk in. They put in their order. 

Several more minutes pass and an order gets served and it's not mine but a similar order to mine but 2 sandwiches that the people ordered. Not cool, guys.

Update: still sucks. Filing a franchise complaint. Someone clearly hired their kids. It's damaging your brand!"}
{"text":"This sandwich spot was very good. The Capistrami was quick and delicious. The bread was probably the best part."}
{"text":"First and foremost they were flexible.  I asked to change a sub into a sandwich on wheat bread and they had no problems accommodating me.  The sandwich I had was delicious and a bit unique (not your usual Subway type sandwich).  My husband had a club sandwich and also enjoyed it.  One unique thing I liked was that this place server their turkey like it was Thanksgiving day leftovers - shredded off the bone - not sliced like traditional lunch meat.   

Well worth a visit for lunch if you're in the casino."}
{"text":"I LOVE CAPRIOTTI'S!!
I absolutely adore their specialty sandwich, the capristrami's...OMG!!!
I usually order it with a side of cranberry sauce.  When I used to live in Vegas, this was my favorite sandwich place to go.   Now that I'm in DC, I'm almost willing to drive 2 HOURS away to Elkton, MD, which is the closest Capriotti's Sandwich joints near me.
this place is VERY VERY YUMMY! and the service is always nice, service with a smile, all the way."}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to lunch joints whenever I am in Las Vegas. Not only are sandwiches cheap, but they are made of quality ingredients that taste fresh and the staff is super friendly. My usual go-to sandwiches are the Bobbie as well as the Italian, which is a hot sandwich. The Italian is amazing with sweet peppers and the flavors all melt together when heated. Love. The Bobbie is basically a thanksgiving sandwich with stuffing, cranberry sauce, and turkey. It comes with mayo too but I never get it since its overkill and gives it this weird creamy texture I don't care for. Regardless, also amazing. 

This place is definitely low-key, and off the main bustle of the strip. Most times I've gone, its mainly a locals lunch joint. As I've said before, staff is super helpful and theres also parking out front!"}
{"text":"this place is hardly a 5 star operation i had a pastrami sandwich on there white bread roll with a bag of chips and a drink 11bucks or so. a bit pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"We routinely get take out, but today we stayed and ate. Our service was fabulous and the presentation and food was awesome as well!"}
{"text":"This was the best food I have ever had at a sandwich shop, you have to get the Bobbie, or the cheese steak,  If you go there the cap specials are the way to go...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were looking for new things to try and just happened to find Capriotti's and we weren't disappointed! The sandwhiches were pretty good. I got the Bobbie sandwhich which basically tasted like a Thanksgiving dinner in sandwhich form... it was unique and I actually REALLY like it. It sounds too weird when you read the description, but if you like Thanksgiving dinner, you have to try this sandwhich!! 

My boyfriend had the Italian sub which was just packed full of italian deli meat. They definitely don't skimp out on the meat! The sandwhich was a little greasy, but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it. I'm looking forward to trying the philly cheesesteak next time :)

My one complaint is that the shop is a little small. There are only a few stools and a small counter to sit at to eat. So probably a good place for take out, and I'm pretty sure they deliver too! A plus."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite sandwich out! The Capistrami is so addicting and tasty. I've ventured out a little and tried the Bobby and the Cheesesteak which are also great but I always come back for the Capistrami!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place. I eat a 20\" sandwich on my birthday every year. 

My favorite is the veggie turkey (just not a meat fan), I ask for it grilled and put everything on it, all the spicy and sweet peppers, mayo, mustard, oil and vinegar."}
{"text":"Loved my sandwich! But more than that I loved the young lady who took our order and helped us! We were 1st timers and she was so kind!"}
{"text":"DAYUM! ...DAAYUMM!! Just had a Mushroom Cheese Steak Sandwich here at Capriotti's, and...DAAAAAYUM!! Can I just tell you that from the first bite that sandwich never stood a chance...I barely came up for air! That sandwich tickled every single neuron in the pleasure-center of my brain. Seriously. In the immortal words of Tracy Morgan, \"I wanted to take it behind the middle school and...\" oh nevermind; you get the point. This place makes the best Cheese Steak Sandwiches I've had NOT in Philly.

Oh, their other sandwiches are grand too! I've been here before and had others. The Italian...? Immaculate! They should change the name to that: \"The Immaculate Italian.\" There are no flaws in their perception of what an Italian Sandwich should taste like. Perfection...you get to eat! And you should. I believe there are other \"sub\" sandwich shops in Ahwatukee; but don't bother. One bite from this place will make you a believer.

Lastly, I do have one complaint. The way you order/pay is a bit cumbersome. Meaning, they don't want your money until your sandwich is ready...which would be okay if you had the place to yourself. But you don't. There's always a line. Which means when your sandwich is already finished (and should be in your mouth), you still have to wait in line to pay. Not cool. I could have been eating 4 minutes earlier. **Hey guys, change your system so that you pay WHEN YOU ORDER. It will make all of us happier to feast on your sandwiches sooner. Thanks**

Okay, enough ranting. Great sandwiches here! Some of the best. Check it out if you haven't done so already. You'll be hooked...."}
{"text":"Called in a order for a 20 inch sub and asking them to get extra slaw and dressing on the side. They said they ended up putting it inside which I do not see at all. Then I asked for extra sauce and he ended up getting small amount of dressing for a 20 inch sub."}
{"text":"The very best cheese steak in the valley! Always great, timely service at this location. We love the weekend delivery."}
{"text":"Popped in here about noon on a Friday afternoon. First off, the counter is a little disorganized. I couldn't tell where the line began and where it ended. The staff also seemed new, and not at all prepared for the lunch rush. While my name is clearly \"Ben\", the cashier seemed to have heard \"Matt\" but at least she got my sandwich right. 
I ordered my standard: a medium \"bobbie\" with cheese. I've got to say that I've had this sandwich probably 4 times now at other Capriotti's, and this was the driest that it has ever come. A sandwich that features stuffing, bread and dry turkey better have some mayo on it. Otherwise, your mouth will be left drier than Britney Spears' concert calendar. 
The sandwich is still quite filling and the three stars was really for this particular rendition of it. The other sandwiches from the Sahara off-the-Strip Cap's have been phenomenal."}
{"text":"I was expecting some great, instead I got something meh....

I came in on a quiet Saturday afternoon, and by quiet I mean I was the only one in store. I ordered \"The Bobbie\" as I had heard all these great things about it. 

The sandwich lacked toppings. I tasted a LOT of bread and not a whole lot of turkey, or cranberry, or even stuffing. I might give them one more shot by trying another sub. If they don't meet the hype that Yelp has given them then I'll take my business elsewhere. 


Note to employee's: SMILE! Customers hate seeing miserable looking staff."}
{"text":"Capriotti's served up a fair sandwich (philly cheese steak w/ everything...) I'd give them 4 stars - but things were a little disorganized and slow. Price is ok. I plan on going back and seeing if the slow service wasn't just a fluke.

Overall a decent sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Love the sandwich, hate the service.  Capriotti's has what is possibly the worst business model.  They bake bread in the morning and close when they are out of bread.  Often this is about 7pm.  This particular location is the the Smith's parking lot, so sometimes when I go to the grocery story, I think I'd really like a sandwich.  Then, when I come out of the store - they are closed.  I've dealt with this at least 5 different times.  If you're open until 9, have enough product to be open until 9. If you regularly run out at 7, you can do the math for 2 more hours and make that much more..."}
{"text":"Used to live 4 blocks from the original Caps. It's solid, not the same as home, but that's probably my personal bias. Staff is always lovely. The Bobbie is always a good choice. It's thanksgiving on a hoagie roll."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Quick service. And good food that won't leave you feeling like a slug. It's a major step up from your typical fast food sub options"}
{"text":"I mean Capriottis food is amazing but this places service wasn't amazing. So did a deliver order. They said it'll be like 30 mins. An hour goes by..no order! Called they said the delivery guy was out already. K like 5 mins later the guy came. He didn't call when he got here so our front desk person had to come get me. Got my order..missing a sandwich! Called the store the said they'll make it and send it ASAP. Ok I give them ups for that..told them ok 15 mins it better be here. It turned 15 mins so I called asking where it is. They said the delivery guy was out. Then ok 2 mins later he came. But didn't call again!!!!"}
{"text":"12/11/15
Came this way to grab food on the boyfriend's lunch break. This Capriotti's is located on Charleston Blvd next to the Walmart Neighborhood Market. 

The moment we walked in we were greeted by a friendly employee behind the counter, who had a hilarious sense of humor. I ordered my sub that was a medium Philly Cheese Steak! 

Great sub, it wasn't super greasy, and the best part was that it's a really flavorful sandwich.

Now I wasn't thinking when I ordered the medium, it was too big, but oh well- I ended up bringing the other half home."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their sandwiches, and the customer service was great!!! The first time I visited Capriotti's, I was privileged to indulge in a Hot Spicy \"Chicken Cheese Steak\" sandwich, with added mushrooms, fried onions, and hot peppers. It was the best sandwich I have probably ever had, at least in a long, long, long time!!! The sandwich was hot, literally a hot sandwich with hot peppers, oh the cheese was melty. So of course, I came back. Today my husband said, \"get me exactly what you had last time! That was good.\"
Again, super good!!! I was fortunate to have he cheese steak, and I got it with the fried onions, mushrooms and hot peppers. OMG, anything steak is good. 
Now I put four stars because the cashier, the first time, forgot to give me the free sandwich that I had a coupon for. I had to wait five minutes for a manager to cancel my order and re-ring me up. And the chips, at least the salt and vinegar, and capriotti ones were no bueno. But they are there for the sandwiches, not the chips."}
{"text":"Coming from the South Bay, when I lived in Sin City I totally missed sandwiches from Togos. So imagine my excitement when some co-workers put me on to Capriotti's. The sandwiches here are amazing! My faves are the Capistrami and the Bobbie - which is totally like a little bit of Thanksgiving.. all you need is some pumpkin pie."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is the best thing about Vegas, well at least for me. If you're not familiar, Capriotti's is famous for serving up sandwiches from your shoulder to your fingertips (20 for $13), specifically the Capastrami which consists of pastrami, swiss cheese, Russian dressing and cole slaw.

Man-o-man this sandwich is good. I love my sandwiches with crispy bread, but Capriotti's serves it up soft and saucy. The hot pastrami is layered on the soft bread, topped with melted swiss cheese; the dressing is tangy and not too heavy; and the crispy cole slaw adds the perfect crunch to the sandwich.

I heard the Bobby is also a fan favorite at this sandwich joint. The Bobby is described as Thanksgiving in a sandwich. It consists of turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing.

If you have money, please start your own franchise of Capriotti's in SF. I'll definately be a regular."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's. It really is the best sub chain around!

I like how you can taste the good quality, distinctive flavors of each ingerdient.  
You can taste bread, and meat and cheese unlike say, Subway, where everything is just Subway flavor."}
{"text":"I love cappriottis because they have options for my vegan kid. This location has never dissappointed us. Other locations might run out of the veggie turkey or not have enough tuna for a sandwich on a Friday during Lent, but this location has never had that issue. The folks working inside are friendly, they greet you when you come in even if they're in the middle of a sandwich. The store is always clean and ran efficiently."}
{"text":"So, thinking that there is a shop across from where I work at, I downloaded the app on my way to work.  Lunch time comes, and I place my order. Put my work address in. I'm right across the street mind you... $16 for a nine inch sub... WTF!?!?! The delivery charge was $8.  Cancelled my order and deleted the app.  Decided to run over anyways because I didn't want fast food. Found out that they don't have a driver and use a service. Well, not my fault you don't have a driver, shouldn't advertise that you deliver when You Don't.  As for the sub, it was ok. I've had much better.  Also it wasn't as I ordered it.  But, I'll throw ya a bone... better than Subway."}
{"text":"I have gone in 3 times and have always found the sandwiches to be just okay. Maybe i'm not ordering the right things."}
{"text":"CHEESESTEAK WITH EVERYTHING ON IT! 

Now that I got your attention, Capriotti's has got some of the best sandwiches around. Every time I see one, I immediately look at the time hoping that it is lunch time or at least close to it. I have tried all their sandwiches (which are all good), but it seems like every time I go I end up getting either the cheesesteak or the capastrami. With it I always get the grilled onions, mushrooms, sweet and hot peppers. 

Of course I can't go on until I give their signature sandwich its props. The Bobbie. This sandwich is what made Capriotti's famous. Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and bit of mayo. With this sandwich, you don't have to wait til November to have it. You can have it year round! 

They only have one kind of bread which in some people's eyes are one dimensional, but in this case, their bread is so good and fresh, that I think that's all they need! Oh, did I mention they bake it from scratch every day? So you know it's gonna be fresh every time.

For more info, visit their website: www.capriottis.com"}
{"text":"The  sandwich I had did not taste good the bread tasted  kind of stale  The customer service was terrible. They lost a customer because 
I'm not be going  back"}
{"text":"Two words: The Bobbie. It's like Thanksgiving. But all year round. This delectable sandwich is made with REAL shredded turkey with all the fixings (stuffing, cranberries, mayo). The restaurants (it's a local chain) roast full birds every day. What pushes the sandwich to a higher level is the quality of the soft bread. Oh, and their spicy Philly Cheesesteak has won multiple awards. Their salads are also very tasty. This shop has put all other chain sandwich shops to shame."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich place in Vegas. I recommend the Capistrami or the Bobby, they are amazing. Also a good tip is to go with a friend and split a 20\" sandwich, makes it significantly cheaper there!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and open 24hrs! A must try. The Capastrami is where it's at."}
{"text":"I think their food is good and unique but they are WAY overpriced! And the smallest sub you can get is 8\". I would like one half that size."}
{"text":"Ok this is my go to sandwich shop! I love love love the Bobbie!!! And now I noticed they make soup too!!!! My belly just smiled!!! . 

So today is the first cold rainy day of the season and all I could think of was nice warm soup while I'm stuck working all day. So low and behold I'm looking for soup in town square and this pops up for chicken noodle and broccoli cheddar soup!!! There is a part in the skies and I follow the sun to get my soup and half Sammie which today is a Bobbie!!!! Today there is no struggle, there is no chill! I have bone warming soup!

Just when I was about to ask which is better  I see the sign only chicken noodle and tomato today! Well that answered my question. The nice people said broccoli sells out fast!!! Like in hours!!! 

But for those who don't know what the Bobbie is... It's thanksgiving!!! Fresh turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo on bread!!!"}
{"text":"Was not happy. Ordered a Cole Turkey. The meat was dry, the cheese bland, and wayyyyy to much cole slaw. It was if I ordered a cole slaw sandwich with cheese topped with shredded turkey. Did I mention the turkey was dry?"}
{"text":"In need of something filling just off the strip? Capriotti's will do the trick. I came here two days in a row out of convenience. Each time service was interesting, and I'll leave it at that. I also didn't feel like the dining area was the cleanest. They do have a lot of sandwiches to choose from, and I like that there are different sizes that you can select based on how hungry you are.

On the first day I went with the Homemade Meatball: meatballs made from scratch topped with marinara sauce, provolone and grated Romano cheese. The meatballs were small and had a slightly burnt taste to them, and it needed much more cheese. I didn't like how the bread wasn't toasted and quickly became soggy. I wouldn't order this again. On the second day I had the Homemade Turkey sub. This sandwich was worlds better and the turkey is the way to go because it is roasted and hand pulled. It reminds me of a Thanksgiving turkey, no deli meat here. The hot peppers and oil really completed the sandwich, giving it tons of flavor, and upon returning I would order it again."}
{"text":"Pickles, Pickles Pickles ! It was only after my 3rd visit that I got  pickle chips on a sandwich and I have to say they were the best Pickle I have yet to try in al my nearly 5 decades here on earth! 

The Sandwich I had yesterday was weird though tasty, I kinda thought they made a mistake and gave me tuna. It was THE TURKEY,The Turkey meat was in shreds and very wet, that with the pickles, peppers, mustard, mayo and vegies It was a conundrum.

I wanted the same sandwich I had a few days prior but I didn't recognize it on the menu, I now know it was THE ITALIAN. This sandwich is so fresh with great meats and fresh toppings it was a winner and I was both Happy and Sad I had to share it with a hungry coworker.

My first impression last week on my first visit, I had the CAPISTRAMI, It was highly recommended by the cashier and although I have never wanted to order a Ruben, I must say the sandwich was a solid 9 out of 10.

I love the location of this new Capriotties, It's a very welcome addition of fast casual restaurants that scatter the area I work in. Americas Taco Shop, Qudoba, Paradise Bakery are weak options and I almost would rather go hungry. That problem is solved with Capriotties now in the hood.

What needs work are the side options, as of now only chips, I hope they work on that! 

What doesn't need work is the sandwiches and Ultra helpful, professional, and extra friendly staff.

Welcome to Old Town CAPRIOTTIES!!!!! Keep up The Great work!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and sandwhiches! Customer service was awesome.  Friendly staff and the establishment was clean."}
{"text":"Tried their Cheese Steak last week and was very pleased!! Chose the spicy peppers instead of the sweet and they did give the sandwich some definite pep. Will be back"}
{"text":"I tried placing an order for pickup over the phone 3 times on my way home from work. I decided I would just go in and order once I got there. I arrived and wasn't greeted by anyone, the two people working just kept cooking. The phone was ringing off the hook with no one answering. There were two people at the cash register, who I thought were waiting for their food and to pay. After ten minutes one of the workers finally greeted the people at the cash register and I realized they hadn't been greeted or ordered yet either. I walked out. Terrible, terrible service."}
{"text":"Bottom Line: Very Nice Sandwich.  

Ate there 4 times last time I was in Vegas.  Good amount of meat for price. If I hadn't looked it up, I would have driven right by. Worth a stop.

Would definately recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is always fantastic, and the people are really nice!"}
{"text":"Put me on hold for 3-4 minutes then hang up on me. Awesome customer service, then when I call back its like nothing ever happened. I love the brand but this location sucks."}
{"text":"The bobbie is always a great choice when you're in the mood for a sammy. But, their smallest size is 9\" -- guaranteed to put you in a food coma. After eating that for lunch I just wanted to pass out. I wish their small size was only 6\". That I could handle, but the extra 3\" is just too much to take (that's what she said)."}
{"text":"Capriotti's really? Is this not the best place to grab the best sandwich in the world? I moved to Northern California, remote area 100 miles each of SF and the ONE thing I missed more than anything!!!! (besides my ex) was CAPRIOTTI'S!!! omg .. the capastrami / the bobbi / you cannot go wrong with this place it is THAT good."}
{"text":"It doesn't get any better. This is not a fancy place, it has no frills, no music, no cloth napkins but you know what it does have? The best darn sandwiches in town, I am telling ya! Look at that Capastrami sandwich pic I posted with the pastrami, Russian dressing and slaw -- it does not, repeat it does not, get.any.better.than.this. Truly. As I mowed down my \"small\" Capastrami (that is enough for two if you're calorie conscience or not that hungry) that I must get at least once every few months, a customer entered and was staring at the menu. Then he mumbled that he'd never been here before and wasn't sure what to get! What to get? OMG .. get anything! LOL everything here is good and last time I checked, if you eat here and check in your Yelp app when you pay, you get a free dessert. I love this place. Super YaY!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! Not Capriotti's but this location, the guy took my money with his gloves on and then proceeded to make sandwiches. This has to be against health code, every sandwich I ordered came out wrong. I love Capriotti's but this place needs new management big time. Over the owners need to get things together, for now everyone go to the one on Blue Diamond and Decatur. You'll be impressed"}
{"text":"I had to try \"The Bobbie\" after hearing people rave about it. I've never been overly impressed by Capriotti's and this sandwich was on par with the rest of their food; just OK. 
I LOVE stove top stuffing. I LOVE cranberry sauce.  And I like turkey sandwiches.  So this sandwich sounded promising. Unfortunately it just wasn't anything special. I could definitely make this at home faster and cheaper. On the plus side the small 9\" sandwich was pretty big."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!  The employees are super friendly and helpful.  I had cheesesteak sandwich and it was delicious.  My kids loved their food which is always a bonus when it comes to them.  Great place for families with kids (my 2 year old ran around & nobody seemed to mind.  As a parent of 3, It's nice going to a kid friendly place.  We will be back :-)"}
{"text":"They aré ok. Service is not fantástic. Staff isn't  attentive at all. A bit over priced. Just go when my friend pays, so it's not my money that is wasted. Bah place"}
{"text":"Service was great, but the food is incredibly bland and flavorless. Definitely not my first choice for a good sandwich."}
{"text":"This place always takes good care of me. The food is always great. I have never had a bad sandwich or visit."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome. That it is a chain makes it all the more remarkable.

The Cran-Slam Club is like a little -- no, pretty good size -- piece of Thanksgiving year-round.

This particular location looks sketchy from the outside as mentioned by others, but it is just fine on the inside.

If you're in town at the north end of the Strip and you can get away for a lunch, do it. This is far better than they are hiding in the casinos and you can get a size-able sandwich and drink for under $10."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a Capriotti's ever. Huge line to order, out of their specialty meats, notified 15min after order, no one working the kitchen. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I'm underwhelmed. From other reviews it sounded like this place would be good to grab a salad. I got iceberg lettuce and attitude. I'd suggest you drive a little further and try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've lived in the area 10 plus years and have grown fond of the Capriottis littered throughout the Valley. From Boulder city to the Aliante pkwy locations, I never have issues. EXCEPT THIS ONE SHOP. Ever since I graduated high school this place had constant issues with customer service, lack of inventory, and most of all, lacking th3 ability to read a damn receipt to put a very easy order together. I ordered food for the family tonight and not one persons meal was fully correct. Missing ingredients, lack of exisiting ingredients, and cold meat. I ordered cheese on my sub, both on the cheese selection and the special instructions. I asked for RAW onion... they decided I don't need any. Stop hiring high school kids who lack workmanship or can stay off the bong for more than an hour. 

Chive on."}
{"text":"I happen to love cheesesteaks and even more so that I found this place. They are known for their Thanksgiving sandwiches but I am thrilled about the cheesesteaks. They use great quality meats and the bread is great as well. I also suggest the Capastrami sandwich as well which is a hot pastrami with thousand island dressing and coleslaw. It's incredible. 

The restaurant is always clean and the staff is always helpful and easy to deal with. For all of these reasons I give this place a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Pricey but if you're stuck with a craving for a steak sandwich, it'll do. The cook put too much mayo on my sandwich. 

The Green Valley location is great because you can take your sando over to the sports book."}
{"text":"We had placed a $300.00 order for a catered event for our church. The sandwiches were ok and the staff was decent, however I found the manager to be quite rude.
This may be great for some, but for us we found it less than appealing.
Sorry to say I won't be coming back.
I simple thank you would have went a long way,, they obviously don't need our business"}
{"text":"My BF and I are always in a hunt for a good cheesesteak. So far, this is the best one I've had in AZ. 

Mushroom Cheesesteak with sweet peppers and onions! I like how everything is cooked up and mixed together with the cheese as the binding unit. I can't get myself to try their other sandwiches since I don't make it out this way too often and when I do I want that cheesesteak! The bread is soft with little cornmeal bits. It all goes together perfectly.

The small is huge and good for two meals. The large is enough to feed the entire office. lol. Okay, I overexaggerated a little... but seriously it's huge!"}
{"text":"I have cravings for these subs! Everything is fresh and delicious. Very generous portions of meat and toppings.  Clean environment."}
{"text":"Would never return to this location. 

After being rudely greeted when I came to the counter to pick-up my online order (isn't that the point of an online order, and pre-paying? To not have to wait in line with everyone else who is ordering & paying?), I was told to wait. Having given them a 15min buffer from my pick-up time (again, isn't the point of a pick-up time to not have to wait?) I was surprised by this. 

After finally getting my order and taking it to my destination, I open my food to discover a chicken-less noodle soup, and a balsamic chicken salad with NEITHER balsamic dressing or chicken. 

So thanks Capriotti's! Really enjoyed the noodles in water, and dry lettuce with blue cheese crumbles."}
{"text":"I have been to this shop twice. 
The first order was a philly cheese steak, no onions, no peppers. Got peppers and onions. Strike one.
Yesterday Ordered two sandwiches, a 20\" ham and turkey, got a 9' ham and roast beef. Strike two.
second sandwich was an italian no peppers. Got peppers. Strike three.
Should be able to expect a simple sandwich order to be correct. It's a sandwich shop, not a restaurant with 75 choices of entrees and salads, etc.
Go to Port of Subs just over the bridge at cheyenne and rainbow. Faster service and the sandwich is correct. Damn construction."}
{"text":"Lots of hype without the juice to back it up....I would not waste your time or money....."}
{"text":"I don't have Capriotti's in California, but grew up with it in Las Vegas. I travel to Phoenix often and always make a stop before I leave. The Bobbie is the best sandwich I've ever had. It's like Thanksgiving on a perfectly soft sub roll. Pro tip - It travels well, too. I always get a large, eat half and take the rest home in my carry on bag for my boyfriend. 

Thanks for always being consistent and always making a great sandwich. I love Capprioti's and highly recommend it. Get yourself a Bobbie. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Pathetic. Can you do zero stars? Placed an order at 11:37am, NO one in line at all, walked right up to the register, not exactly lunch rush hour, $13.00 for a med 12\", wow ok. Was not handed my food until 12:04, sorry, had my sandwich thrown on top of the counter at my general direction, by some fool that looks like a Jersey shore reject. Nothing like listening to deafening hip hop club music mid day either, loud enough to prevent the \"employees\" behind the counter from hearing each other 3 feet away from one another. What a bunch of ass clowns. Then again, when you make sandwiches for a living, maybe we shouldn't expect much."}
{"text":"Supposed to be open 24hrs. Doors were locked and the employees were inside fucking around!! Never going back here."}
{"text":"If you've never had Capriotti's food, drop whatever you're doing right now, and get some. I'm a huge fan of the cheese steak with mushrooms, but the Bobby is worth the trip. 

Sandwiches range from \"I'm on a diet, tee hee\" seven inches up to \"I'm filling the void in my life with food\" twenty inch monsters. Warning: buying the big one to have lunch for tomorrow, too, does not work. One you start eating one of their sandwiches, you will keep packing it into your face until it is all gone, and then you'll be sad that it's gone. I had a dream I was eating a Capriotti's sandwich, woke up from the dream, and was depressed the rest of the morning because I didn't have a sandwich. It's that good."}
{"text":"I LURVE the capastrami sandwich. It literally melts in your mouth. The chopped Italian salad and roast beef bleu cheese salad were also stellar. But that capastrami sandwich is still on my mind. Fantastic. I am drawn to it like moth to flame."}
{"text":"this was my second time coming here after taking a 2 year break....why you ask? i have not clue why either...stupid me

so i come with 3 other friends, 2 are newbies to capriottis and don't know what they are geting themselves into, we get 2 20\" Capastrami, should have gotten a bobbie, but there's always next time.

after my first bite all the memories of how good the hot pastrami and cold slaw dances in my mouth. 

damn this place is good."}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation from someone at work.  We were headed to the airport so why not anything beats airport food. This is small little shop, looked very local. Later, I realized this is a chain at least in Vegas. I looked at the menu and saw the cheese steak. They let you add mushrooms and peppers and fried onions. It was a huge sandwich, bigger than all the other sandwich places you might recognize. But I finished it all and it was delicious. It's a lot of food especially if you get the meal which adds chips and a drink. Very good cheese steak sandwich would come back when in town."}
{"text":"I don't care: any place that doesn't reverse charges in a timely manner for a sandwich you never picked up, is garbage. Was told I would get a call when it was reversed and never got it. Below average manager"}
{"text":"Friendly staff and it is clean. They always make the food fast with generous portions . The best Capps in the valley imo."}
{"text":"This place doesn't get the 5 stars because of the food although I am a huge fan of their sandwiches. This place gets the 5 stars because of the employees. This place is a mad house during lunch hours but no matter how busy they are all the employees are always in good spirits. I wish I knew the gentleman's names that works the register I am assuming he is a manager or some supervisor because his customer service is excellent. He always handles the high volume with a smile and takes care of his customers. I've actually waited 45 minutes in this shop and didn't complain at all because to me the vibe I get off the employees and the food is worth the wait and worth my money every time. Keep up the good work and trust me people notice when you do a great job and go above beyond at your place of work."}
{"text":"Below is a copy of an email I sent to corporate regarding this location,  the service there, the attitude of the employees, and the piece of RUBBER I found in my turkey sandwich. 

DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET SICK. PERIOD. 


I've ordered from there many times and did again today. I've always felt it was one of the worst locations in Vegas and that there was little to no training for the staff. They are all very unprofessional, dirty, and grungy looking and the service is almost always terrible.  When we called to order today it took the woman on the phone a long time to get the order right and I was already discouraged but my wife and I went ahead and picked it up anyway. When she went in she said everyone there looked extremely dirty and questioned why a cook came from the back with gloves on to run the register. 

Still, craving a classic Capriottis sandwich we came home and started eating our turkey and cheese Steak. Half way through eating my sandwich I bit into something I thought was a fatty piece of turkey..when I spit it out I found out its something with the consistency of rubber. Im sure  it didn't come from any part of a turkey nor did it belong in my sandwich. I've attached a picture of it and will be happy to hang onto it should you need it for any reason. 

When I think of a Capriottis location I think of good food, nice people, clean restaurants, and this location has disappointed me for the last time. I have every intention of leaving a scathing review online and am tempted to contact the health district to find out why there was a foreign piece of rubber in the middle of my sandwich. I'm truly disgusted and will not only not visit this location ever again, I'm tempted to stop visiting any of them. This location has terrible Yelp and Google reviews and I find it extremely hard to believe that corporate would not be aware of the problems at this store. The fact that this owner is allowed to continue these terrible business practices is appalling and beyond comprehension.  I'm sure in your franchise contract there are provisions for keeping a certain standard and this location either needs to be bought out or shut down. 

I really hate leaving bad reviews for anyone and hate even more having to write corporate to complain about my experience but I cannot let this go. I'm sitting here writing this questioning what else was in my food that I might not have noticed and am feeling truly disgusted. 

I'm not looking for anything and I definitely don't want any free food or for this owner to contact me to try and make things right. I'm going to call the store and ask for a refund. If they are unable or unwilling I expect that refund to come from you.  If nothing else works I'll be calling my credit card company and issuing and chargeback for what we just paid. 

For the sake of the rest of your locations and their owners I highly suggest you investigate this location, the owner,  and the employees that work there. They have caused you to lose a loyal and die hard customer forever."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from this place and have been meaning to check it out for a while. Today I finally got that chance! I had to do a little research on the place before I headed over there; not all sandwich joints are like Subway where you're given a choice of cold cuts and veggies. No, this place has their own sub-style...which happens to be fucking delicious. 

The menu is decent -- about 4-5 items per 'category' (hot subs, sandwiches, salads, etc.). I read rave reviews on the Capistrami...AND that they have a 20\" sub. Gimmie dat! I love pastrami!! 

Went in at the perfect time...there was only one other customer ahead of me and he'd already placed his order. About 2 minutes after I'd placed my order, people just started pouring in to the place!! You can also call your order in for pick-up AAAAAND they deliver!! Right then I knew I'd made the right decision to grub here. 

Got my sammy...headed home and devoured as much as I could. In all honesty, I was expecting a lot more pastrami flavor.  Thinly sliced pastrami piled on a lengthy white hoagy with creamy, crunchy Cole slaw & Russian dressing... The flavors that it did have tied well together and It tasted pretty damn good with a beer, I'll tell ya. 

I'll be back for sure...but next time for the cheese steak.. :-)"}
{"text":"We recently catered a work lunch with Capriotti's, so I was able to sample a variety of their offerings.  Roast beef, italian, meatball were all solid and reminiscent of other great deli sandwiches I have come across, and their famous \"Bobbie\" sandwich, which is pretty much Thanksgiving wrapped in a roll, uses top notch turkey along with cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo.  But the sandwich that really blew my socks off was the Capistrami:

The Capistrami is pretty much what must have resulted when Mr.  Reuben  got it on with Miss Memphis Pulled Pork at Club Sandwich (sidenote: my latest theory on the origin of the enigmatic middle slice of bread in a club sandwich is that it actually represents two sandwiches hooking up, why do you think the other famous sandwich with three slices of bread is called the Big Mac?  Coincidence, I think not!) and conceived a baby consisting of hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing, and cole slaw.   Throw in some heat with their spicy pepper relish and your taste buds won't know what hit them.  Whereas the Bobbie allows you to experience Thanksgiving year round, the Capistrami allows you to experience New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day all at once...i.e. gustatory FIREWORKS!"}
{"text":"This a great sandwich place. My husband is always looking for a good pastrami sandwich and found it here. Service was awesome!  He wants to go here every time we come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"DON'T EVER EAT HERE!!!!!! I'm not a person who writes bad reviews but, I am so upset at what just happened!!! I've tried this place multiple times, and every time its been mediocre. Today was the last straw, I had to wait 30 MINUTES for just 3 sandwiches. All the while everyone else that ordered after me got their sandwiches. I had to stand up to remind them that i was still there, i swear they forgot. By the time i got my sandwich, it had been sitting there and was all soggy!!!!! Not only that, it's necessary to order double toppings because they are so cheap they will literally sprinkle on 3 shards of lettuce and call it finished. There is one guy there that can competently make a sandwich correctly, but I think they fired him because he put too many toppings on the sandwich god forbid. The bread isn't even the same there, it's like some shitty cheap bread.   Do yourself a favor, don't go to this cappriottis, it's like the reject one that nobody cares about. I'm going to the one in southern highlands from now on........"}
{"text":"Best value I've had in Vegas .
Cheese steak sub was the most flavorful I've ever had. Spicy , beefy and cheesy every mouthful  ! 
A must visit for anyone down here ! 
Wife and kids were equally as happy with theirs . Wife had the Bobby and loved every bit . Kids had tuna and the cheese steak done mild ."}
{"text":"THE BEST. A must stop when in the area. Quality ingredients and service! Wish they had shops where we live!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches!!! I am very sad however that I  will be driving to another location from now on. They were very rude and acted like we were asking them to walk 10 miles because we asked them to put our orders on separate tickets. The assistant manager rolled her eyes and acted like she wanted to slap us. Then, when I asked to add chips and a drink to my order the girl told me to hold on, gave me my coin change and kept my 11 dollars and set it in front of her. She added my chips, rang me up then tried to hand me back a few quarters. I then asked her about my drink and she informed me that I didn't order a drink. I told her never mind. When I asked her for the rest of my change she told me she gave it to me. I told her, \"no you didn't\" and she got an attitude and told me, \"I know for a fact I gave you your change.\" I emptied my pockets and showed her all I had was the coin change she gave me. Then the Assistant manager  Donna again acting like we were bothering her told her just to give it to me and she would count it later. Well then when I tried to call the manager Carlos, he was in a meeting and then left. I guess the business of our office and corporate office meeting once a month are not important enough for him to call me back. 
VERY BAD SERVICE, IF I WAS THE OWNER, I WOULD FIRE THESE RUDE PEOPLE AND START OVER WITH PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!"}
{"text":"I love love love love this location! The lady with the salt and pepper hair (I think) makes the BEST cheesesteak! I'm usually very satisfied with how they make their sandwiches. Sometimes I get disappointed because the cheesesteak is too dry, or not enough cheese. I guess it just depends on when you go, and who makes your sandwich. The service here is way better than the other locations. I stopped going to the location by my house because of their poor service. This store is one of the reasons why I love this neighborhood. :)"}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's. Unfortunately, this location disappoints me. I am subjected to go to this location because it is the only one close to me. What I really dislike about this particular location is that they squish the bread so much! If anyone from this location ever reads this please stop squishing the bread while you're packing the sandwich. Every single time I come here the bread always ends up looking so thin and squished. I didn't order a flatbread sandwich. I want a nice and fluffy bread for my sandwich. I'll change my rating only if they stop squishing the bread so much. =\"}
{"text":"I don't know, I think its overrated. its nothing too special. they over load their sandwiches with mayonnaise, butter, and other oily fats. maybe it's just me since i'm a bit of a health freak. butttt my boyfriend is all about it."}
{"text":"Sad excuse for a sandwich shop.

All tables were dirty even though the place was completely empty. 
They're open 24/7, like why?

Horrible nasty salad. Asked for chicken and got none.

Crazy Metallica music blasting thru the speakers. 
Whatever happened to easy listening? 
How am I supposed to enjoy eating a salad when loud demonic music is giving me a headache.

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. 
Meh."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are excellent and decently meaty.  I haven't tried any other items, but will in the future based on the quality of the sandwiches.  Service is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"It okay. Nothing to brag about. It's average at best.  Quiznos is better."}
{"text":"I must say that I have been here four times in four weeks.  The sandwiches are great.  The bread is fresh and tasty clearly made within hours of serving.  The order is taken right when you walk in, so there is no unnecessary waiting.  Most of the time the line is short and I get served within minutes.  The sandwiches use a reasonable portion of meats and other ingredients which balance the sandwich, not bury it in the bread.  The guys behind the counter know there sandwiches and can answer any if not all questions that you may have.   

I normally get a medium sandwich, the large is just too large (e.g. two meals!).  They also serve Wise brand potato chips from the East Coast which are hard to come by in Phoenix, but not impossible.
A great place to have a quick lunch that will not have you waiting and keep you satisfied throughout the day.
My recommendations................."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in vegas no questions asked. Everyone i know is obsessed with the capistrami i say its just ok nothing special there.. BUT the BOBBIE is INSANE!!!! Most carb loaded sandwich that is horrible for you and sooooo tasty. They dont normally but veggies on it but I order it with the works man i crave this sandwich all the time. Italian is good not the best Cole Turkey is awesome for sure! Never had the burgers too hard to move away from Bobbie!!!!! Get here asap"}
{"text":"Outstanding sandwiches!  The Capistrami and Slaw-B-Joe's ROCK!  Moreover, nobody can come close to the bread that they use.  Capriotti's would deliver sandwiches to our Little League snack stand, and they were always snapped up within minutes."}
{"text":"WOW! We both had great tasting sandwiches and the service is fast and friendly! Check them out!"}
{"text":"I will never go to another sub shop if there's a Capriotti's within driving distance.  Quality food, quick and efficient service, and courteous staff.  My favorite is The Bobby (light on the mayo) and I salivate as I'm thinking of it.  Today is Memorial Day and the husband's cooking steaks on the grill but I secretly wouldn't mind if we just went to Capriotti's instead."}
{"text":"I really love this sandwich shop :-) Gotta try the bobby...in fact I'm thinking of saying screw you to making the thanksgiving dinner and just ordering up some bobby's to eat ;-) Another yummy creation is the Cole turkey, thats been my go to sandwich. Beware the sizes are large! A large sandwich can easily feed 3 people for lunch so just realize what you are ordering."}
{"text":"Got a really bad Bobbie today which was my bad for not watching her make my sandwich. My sandwich was a large and was mostly stuffing and an overdose of cranberry very little turkey compared to past Bobbie."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches. Great price and would highly recommend. Very clean and simply a must buy when im in the area. Subway who?"}
{"text":"I pass Capriotti's all the time, but finally stopped in. Wow, great sandwich at a reasonable price.  I uad the Cole Turkey because I'm on a coleslaw kick right now.  Real turkey, you know, like after thanksgiving. Not ground and pressed.  Should have gotten a small though!"}
{"text":"Sigh. I love capriottis, I really do. The cappastrami is one of the best things in the world. But I try to place an order online, the system says they don't take delivery. When I call they tell me they can deliver. I place my order and they said oh there's a min of $20 so they cant deliver my order. I placed it for pick up instead because I wanted their cappastrami. I get there it's not ready, I wait there and they tell me they will start it, because they lost my order."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how they determine the sizes, but a small sandwich here is 9\". Their famous offering is the Bobbie, which is Thanksgiving wrapped in a sandwich. All the food you love at Thanksgiving is here: turkey, cranberry sauce and STUFFING! Will be back for more next time! (Heard the Capristrami is good too)"}
{"text":"Been loving Capriotti's for years. Fresh cold cut sandwitches. They have the best hot n cold subs in town."}
{"text":"Not all Capriotti's are created equal! I used to work at a bar up the street from this particular location and would stop in once a week for a giant Philly or Bobbie. I have always gotten the correct order in a timely manner and everything they have made here plain and simply tastes better than other locations. You'd think because it's a chain it would be the same across the board, it simply isn't.  I stop in here every few months now when I am on that side of town for laser tag just up the street and it's always a treat. I have stopped going to other locations, so if I am craving Cap's I just go to this one or end up going a different route because other places just simply aren't as good.  Their staff has changed a bit over the past few months which is to be expected, but they have always been pleasant regardless of who they are. Just wish this place was closer to my house or the locations that ARE were as good as this one!"}
{"text":"I called to place my order for a work lunch for only 6 people.  After I made it through about 3 orders,  I was asked to hang up and use the online ordering system.  I thought that was slightly odd, but ok. I hung up and went online.

As I was ordering, I got a call back and was thanked for going online to order as they are trying to make a push for customers to order online rather than call in. I was told they would throw in some free cookies as a thank you. I thought that was very nice and hung up happy.

I finish my online order.  Left comments for a few of the orders - but nothing major or super picky - simply asked for a couple salad toppings on the side. I tried to complete my order and the website claimed they didn't deliver to my area.  So, I have to call back again and the person on the phone says to make it as pick up and they would deliver.  Ok, great. 

Our delivery gets here and it's completely disappointing.  Of the 6 orders, only 2 are correct and there were no extra cookies, napkins or silverware!  Three of the salads were missing dressing and one of the salads was the wrong dressing. I called and told the same person I've been talking to this whole time that we were missing dressings and there were no cookies.  He told me he included cookie coupons....why would I want a cookie coupon and not the actual cookie???  I was told they would bring the dressings as soon as they could...which they did pretty timely, however one was still missing!  

I've eaten at the restaurant before and LOVED the food and had great service, but this is just not acceptable. Terrible service and we will NOT be ordering delivery/catering from them again."}
{"text":"My sister introduced me to this place.  Probably some of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  The Capastrami is so good!  I was in Vegas for 8 days and I visited three times.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I will be there!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and today I was disappointed today. The tables were all dirty and we had to ask for someone to come out and clean them. It's possible that the Saturday crew was working and they are not as dedicated as the weekday crew. The last time I was here was with a few friends from work and the experience was awesome. Disappointed today and I will make sure that the next time I return is during the week- Monday to Friday"}
{"text":"Got the Capastrami and yup, it's living up to its delish reputation!  It took longer than I thought it would take to get the sandwich, though. There was only one person ahead of me, so I figured that it would be pretty quick to make my Medium-size Capastrami. My wait was less than 10 minutes and we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's yet another Capriotti's location. They seem to be popping up all over the city lately. Mind you, that is not a complaint! Capriotti's has always made consistently tasty and yummy subs.

This location is located just south of the 215 freeway, off of Eastern Avenue. It can be found in the same shopping area as In and Out Burger, Chuck E. Cheese, and the 99 cents Store. This location is fairly new. I belive it just opened maybe a month or so ago.

I always end up ordering the Bobbie, the Capastrami, or the Slaw Be Jo. On this occasion, I ended up ordering a medium Slaw Be Jo($8.39). As usual, the sandwich was tasty! 

I am psyched about having a location so close to the house!

The employees were polite and friendly. I was automatically greeted when I stepped through the door and was given great service even when I picked up my sandwich to go. I don't think a lot of people are really aware of this location yet. It was pretty dead in there. There was only one other patron, besides myself. What was funny is that I counted no less than 5 employees there at the time! Whaaaaat? Man, you guys are really ready for when the ish hits the fan!

It's Capriotti's. It's reliable. It's consistent. I love it! ....and now it's the location closest to my house! I will certainly be back for many visits!

4 stars."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but worth it...

had the Sla- B Jo (Roast Beef/Cole Slaw sub)

freakin' sweet!! very tasty....went there on Tuesday evening and the guy working was very friendly....only the second time ever Ive had Capriottis and Ill be back very soon"}
{"text":"Originally we walked into Red Rock Casino tonight to eat at the Yardhouse, but it was a 45 minute to 1 hour wait and f^%k that. Actually, it was a mission trying to find a place to eat tonight that didn't have a ridiculous wait. After doing laps around the place trying to find a place with availability, we pretty much gave up and went to the food court since we just wanted to eat something by that point.

We all quickly agreed on Capriotti's and off we went! My experience here tonight was truly a \"mixed bag\".

(+) The food was really good. I mean like really, really good. I've eaten at many Cap locations and some are much better than others. This is definitely near the top of the list.
(+) Portions were surprisingly huge, which I don't quite get. It was the same price as other Cap locations that I frequent, yet our same subs here were MUCH bigger it seemed. Why is that?? lol I don't know why, but I love it! lol We actually ordered an extra sub to go after eating because we were so impressed by this!

(-) Service was painfully slow. To be fair, they were busy but everything just seemed to move at a snail's pace.
(-) Employees were very nice but seemed a bit confused. One of our subs on our initial order was just plain wrong and not even close to what was ordered, but we were so hungry we just ate it anyways. It was good, don't get me wrong, just not what was ordered.

Basically, food was a 4 and service was a 3, but we will certainly be back and we were pretty much wowed by the portion size so they get the benefit of the doubt and a 4 star rating from me.

4 stars.

Yup. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Very small location by Home Depot. Been here twice so far and have always gotten fast, friendly service. Ive been eating so much Capriotti's lately that an intervention may be in order.

Get yourself some. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This Capriotti's spot can be found on the west side of Rainbow Blvd. and just north of Badura. It's actually tucked in a little mini mall there with Panda Express, Popeye's Chicken, and Jamba Juice in the immediate vicinity.

I've only been here twice now, but so far I am pretty impressed with this location. The workers always seem to be cheery and pleasant.  Not to mention they always seem to be speedy about getting my order together! 

I really dig how they have decorated this particular location. They have lined the walls with all kinds of pics of classic Las Vegas! I love it! While waiting for your order you can see shots of the famed Stardust, how the strip looked in 1958, and Fremont in the 60's among many other vintage shots!

The place looks very clean and orderly also. Obviously, someone is staying on top of things to make sure it stays looking so good!

Whenever I hit any Capriotti's, it has always been either..

- the Bobbie
- Slaw Be Jo
- Capastrami

Maybe one of these days I'll actually try one of the other menu items....but I wouldn't hold my breath, either. Those 3 sandwiches are so tasty and satisfying!

Always delicious. Always reliable. 

4 stars.

BTW: Free Large drink with Yelp check-in!"}
{"text":"Super disgusting experience here. Ordered the broccoli cheddar soup today and when I went to reheat it I found a small roach in the bowl."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would. The employee making people's sandwiches was combing his hair and taking selfies. He did not wash his hands and stuck his hands straight into the lettuce! I asked him what he was doing he said I forgot to wash my hands and wear gloves and smiled! I asked the manager are you training your people u can get people sick! His reply was I'm wearing my gloves and I apologize. Guys you can get people sick!! I will be reporting this to the health department and channel 13 for dirty dining. Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"I had no idea this was so close to where I live. The sandwiches here never disappoint, the staff is always friendly and the price is unbeatable for what you get. My only reasoning for 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish it were a smidge cleaner on the inside."}
{"text":"The Bobbie, the BOBBIE!!! One of the best sandwich spots in Vegas, IMO."}
{"text":"Visited this place last time I was in Vegas. The sandwiches are quality and the menu is quite creative. Next time you are in Henderson, please look this place up - it is worth the search.

A pastrami sandwich, filled with cheese and cole slaw. Yum.

Bring cash - No CC"}
{"text":"Went this location waited in line for 20 min then they said they were out of bread. Really."}
{"text":"my friend has been raving about this place for their turkey sandwich, also called bobby's sandwich,
ingredients: its filled with turkey, cranberry, stuffing & a light mayonnaise on a French roll.
Upon eating it, I think ive had better, the bread is cold, and would taste much better if it was toasted, also since the bread was not toasted, it the sauce made it soggy quick, and over all nothing that great, I can make a better turkey leftover sandwich at home."}
{"text":"Went in to obtain my free 9 inch sub only to realize when I got here that it expired. Had my usual Bobbie and it was terrible. Tasted sour and had tons of cranberry on it. Oh, also found a huge bone in the sandwich."}
{"text":"I came at 10:50 pm hoping to get a sandwich for the movie theater and they told me that it was closed. Sad!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed all of the Capriotti's locations I've been to, but I'm reviewing this one because it's closest to my home. I'm so in love with their veggie cheese steak! The first time I had it, I was so convinced it was chicken I almost sent it back. (I'm no longer pescetarian, but at the time, I was). I don't know if it's tofu or what but it's delicious and is such a great substitute for meat!"}
{"text":"Came in during lunch time (12:00) and it is busy as expected. The guy at the front is very attentive to customers walking in by greeting them and letting the other customers know and approximate time before their food was ready. Great vibe for a Saturday afternoon snack. Customer service at its finest!"}
{"text":"First off I'd like to say that I love Capriotti's. 
I go to them all the time all over Vegas. But the last two I've been to seem to always run out of wheat bread. This is a major problem! 50% or more people want wheat bread over white. So I order a Cole Turkey and asked for wheat bread and they told me they only have it on sliced bread. I said no prob, give me that then I pay for the sandwich. Next thing they realize is the sliced bread that they claim was wheat is not actually wheat bread and they don't have any at all. Now I have no choice but to eat the white bread so I said I might at well, give me the sub on non sliced bread. At this point the service and the delay has ruined my experience at Capriott's. He had to charge me the difference because I switched back to white bread but that's not the point. I probably would of walked out if I didn't pay for it already. 
Capriott's... Stock up on wheat bread!!! If you run out of it it's because people eat a lot of it or your inventory controls are all out of wack. I was reading some of the other reviews for this location and it seems to have ongoing issues at this location which not only hurts this store but the brand itself."}
{"text":"I usually love the sandwiches here but this evening, both our sandwiches were very dry. BEWARE and do not go to this location Saturday evenings"}
{"text":"I have to give Dos stars for the customer service I experienced. I put my order in via internet for pick up. I ordered Chicken sandwich with the hot and sweet peppers combined with Marinara on the side with a bag of bar b que chips and tomato bisque soup. 

When I arrived the staff seemed very busy and their team cohesiveness seemed to be off as they could not find my order first. A few minutes later they found my sandwich but did not have the soup cause they were out of the tomato bisque. I was totally fine with that cause they put in a courtesy call into my phone shortly after the order was submitted. Next they try to put a brownie in the bag with my sandwich and that threw me way off cause I am a diabetic. Truthfully at this point I had forgotten my entire fricken order! Mind you I was on a 20 minute lunch break. So I finally collected myself to know A.) I was not getting the soup I wanted and B.) I want my beloved honey BBQ bag of chips I ordered and I will gladly go. 

When I got back to my office the sandwich was totally hip but I could not taste hardly any or no cheese on it and the marinara sauce the online ordering system allows you to add was stated to be put on the side. Like in a cup on the side...wasn't in the bag and I forgot my order in the midst of the confusion at the store. Go figure... I called and Tawana answers the phone thanking me in the follwing manner. \"Thank you for calling Capritotti's on Rainbow and 215 speaking\". She bursts out an laughs and states, \"I mean Tawana speaking.\" I started to ask a question about how the actual sandwich was to come cause I have never purchased this particular sandwich before. Long story short, the conversation turns into her rudely interrupting and saying. \" I asked you that cause I am trying to get you a free sandwich and I am going to get the Manager now.\" She proceeds to throw down the phone and cop her plea to the poor manager on Duty that has to put up with her tude. Max who was very kind remembered me from the pick up confusion in recent apologizes for Tawana who apparently has missed some training videos in the past. I cannot stand non professional people. We all have to work co exist and get a long. Why make things harder by not caring at all right off the bat? 

I will go back in the future but I don't think it will be anytime soon.

UPDATE: I did return to the store a week later and the gentlemen who took the order apologized for everything and remade my sandwich. Great customer service review bumps up a star for sure."}
{"text":"Always love coming to Capriotti's. They have a fantastic meatball sub and of course the Bobby. I will continue to try the different subs off of their menu but of course always have a go to when I am not sure what to get."}
{"text":"We were so excited to have Capriottis move in right next door.  However, there is an A team and a B team.  Food is always good, but the customer service is hit or miss.  We are borderline ready to ban it and pretend its not right around the corner.  We have had every issue you can imagine, from forgetting to give us a sandwich (we only ever order 2 shouldn't be a rough task) to wrong order.  However, tonight took the cake.  We ordered ahead of time on the app and arrived 6 minutes past the pickup time.  I sat at the drive through window for 4 minutes while I watched 3 employees just standing around and a 4th cleaning the windows.  No one inside and no one else in the drive through. I checked my app thinking I might have messed up and the app (its been gltichy but ok) said I ordered it for tomorrow.  I was like oops.  Thats why no one coming to the window, no one expecting me.  So I drove around and went in sheepishly to see if they could whip up my order and what I believe to be the manager said, \"oh no, we have your order right here\".  I explained I sat at the window for a few minutes and she was like, oh thats weird.  The window cleaner I was observing from the drive through window had made her way to the sneeze guard and pretended I was not standing next to her while she continued to clean and almost knock me over.  Not sure what the heck is up with the B team, but if we have 1 more experience with them I am pretty sure it will be the last."}
{"text":"Scottsdale is a tough crowd. I noticed all the other Capriotti's in the valley have a 4 star rating on Yelp and this location has a 3 star rating.

I've eaten at Capriotti's a lot since it has opened and have found that the sandwiches are consistently good and the service is great. A \"small\" sandwich is 9 inches, I wouldn't even contemplate ordering anything larger. And believe it or not they have a \"medium\" and a \"large\" sized sandwich. I really urge the corporate office to start serving 6 inch sandwiches in order to get the price point down. A sandwich and drink basically hits the $10 mark, which is a little too much for a fast food joint.

My Favorite sandwich is The Bobbie. It's like eating Thanksgiving Dinner in a bun. When I first tried this combination of cold turkey (real turkey), cranberry sauce and stuffing (hold the mayo) I thought no way this could be good. I was hooked once I took my first bite. Yum - a perfect combination of food, like eating Thanksgiving leftovers. I've enjoyed the Cran-Slam Club and The Italian Sausage sandwich as well. I'm determined to try the rest of the sandwiches, but I keep on returning to The Bobbie.

They have a couple of flat screens and seem to play a lot of \"live\" type songs from the Eagles, Beattles, Simon & Garfunkle, Springsteen, etc. A great place to sit back and chill. 

P.S. - Park in the Wal-Mart parking lot across the street to save your sanity."}
{"text":"I came in for some Sandwiches for dinner. It was very clean and I was greeted by both people behind the counter. I came to the register to place my order for a philly cheese steak and a turkey and cheese. They double checked my order and prepared it very quickly and were NOT stingy at all with right about of fixings. Plus they asked if I wanted extra hot peppers on the side for my Philly! I work in the parking lot and now see why it's packed!"}
{"text":"I called in my order. It was ready when I arrived. Friendly kids that work there. Over all it was busy and food was good. The manager was very polite and 2 others were ok. Getting to know the working world. I remember those days. Thank you for your services and quality."}
{"text":"I used to work in a sandwich shop and this place is one of my favorites. They prepare everything after you order which is awesome, takes time but is totally worth it. 

Another plus is that they have big bags of chips, most places only have the regular bags so it's a plus. Guys working in this location are really nice. Quick and friendly."}
{"text":"This is gonna be short and sweet. Good food but I hate when you advertise something you don't have. I can understand if something is online not on your site but you actually don't offer it. You can't fix everything. But on your own windows? If you don't offer delivery please don't have it all over your windows."}
{"text":"I usually eat healthy 99% of the time but when I do indulge it's usually because I have some sort of emotional connection to said food and this my friends is the BOBBIE.

The sandwich has a special place in my heart. Coming home after school or from playing in the park my mom would sometimes bring home this magically, ADDICTIVE wonder known as the Bobbie. This wonderful sandwich, that has shredded turkey, mayo, cranberry sauce and STUFFING, is just plain and simply AWESOME.

Yeah, now that I reside in SoCal I could get it from one of the local shops here but it just doesn't feel the same to me. It has to be in Vegas and this location for the flashbacks of said childhood to occur. 

Yeah, I've been known to fly to Vegas for the day just to get me some.
UMAD? Yeahhhhhh UMAD!"}
{"text":"Sandwich was really good. I got the Italian sub with mustard oil and vinegar. Asked for extra pickles but they barely put any. Decently priced but the guy at the register was really nice. All in all a good place to eat."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong when it comes to the quality of Capriotti's sandwiches.  Excellent customer service, food is prepared in a timely manner and it tastes great!"}
{"text":"Usually, your sandwiches are great. Today, my cheese steak was filled with hard things. I don't know what they were but it was the worst sandwich I've ever had. Maybe you guys overcooked some meat and threw it there to get rid of it. Whatever it was, it was too far and too late for me to drive all the way back there. I might be back to eat again someday, but not someday soon."}
{"text":"Service ranges from mediocre to poor. The sandwiches are alright at this location but are put together in a sloppy manner. The staff are usually in disarray, and often do not pay heed to requests from their customers."}
{"text":"If you don't mind waiting your entire lunch break for your food to be made, this is the place to go. The service here is always slow but the last two times I've come in it has taken them over 30 min to get my food out to me which is my entire lunch break so there's no time to actually eat my lunch. 

The last time I was in though was definitely my last time visiting. I had ordered two of the same sandwiches in two different sizes, and someone else had ordered the same sandwich as well but just one, and someone brought me one of the two sandwiches I ordered and left so, okay I look in the bag, pull out the sandwich, realize it's just one.. I'll keep waiting for the second one. Then the second bag comes out with two sandwiches in it which I guess is my original order, the employee picks up the bag he gave me first and hands it to another customer since apparently that was their sandwich, that I already had and opened. Personally I don't want to be given food some random customer has touched but, maybe that's just me since the employee didn't seem to care when I said that I had already opened the sandwich that he just gave to someone else."}
{"text":"We LOVE Capriotti's!!  We happened to be visiting Vegas, driving back to Orange County & stopped for a sandwich to enjoy on our long Sunday ride home.  All of the Capriotti's in the OC closed down so we never get to enjoy the delicious Capistrami's anymore & no other deli around us does it quite like they do.  The sandwiches were amazing - as always!!"}
{"text":"LOVE the capistrami - my FAVORITE sandwich of all times."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and great service.  But what's with the no restroom policy?  Isn't it a requirement that a restaurant have a public restroom?  The hand sanitizer thing hanging by the register isn't cutting it folks."}
{"text":"Typical Cap's right next to my place so it's convenient.  The staff are actually nice...shocking I know!"}
{"text":"Nice and friendly staff, they enjoyed hearing and commenting on how I was taking my Grandma her first Capriotti's sandwich. :) The Bobbie is my favorite and hopefully will be my Grandma's as well. :)"}
{"text":"A little fancier type of Subway with better value than Quiznos is how I would describe this place to someone who has never been.  I really enjoy the Italian sub and it's great to get the biggest size and split it with 3-4 people.

The flavors are really good here, they put a good amount of seasoning and the tomato and lettuce are very fresh and it goes a long way in the overall taste of the sandwich.  They also have a never impressive selection of Herr's potato chip products where most sandwich shops only have maybe 4 flavors.

If I'm in the mood for a sandwich this is definitely the place I go to!"}
{"text":"The truth is, every  Capriotti's is the same when it comes to food.
They have that down. A Bobby sandwich should, and usually does taste the same regardless of location.

This location has always impressed me with a little bit extra.
The most amazing, friendliest customer service! No matter how busy, or how stressed out, I always feel they are happy to see me and appreciative of my business! That is a gift! One that I always appreciate and keeps me coming back in time and time again.

Our \"go to\" is a 4 sandwhich platter...only $59 and feed my entire office for lunch! (12-13 depending on the day). We like the Bobby, a thanksgiving sandwhich. So good! One one of their specialties! Italian, Roast beef, tuna, etc. as you can see we like it classic. 

Great sandwiches, awesome service and reasonable for lunch. 
How can you go wrong? You can't!"}
{"text":"the promise of homemade turkey and roast beef drew me in, much to my dismay it's shredded. As Ramsey would say 'like a dog's dinner!'. I got the bobby with roast beef, so i could taste both. The bread was good, the stuffing was cold. The meat was chokingly dry. Dry dry. Sawdust tasting. I'm sure the other non shredded meats are great on that bread, this might as well had just been the stuffing and cranberries on the bread. Plus, the manager was bragging about how he just stands around and does nothing but micro manage. Donkeys! Lol. Make that guy clean the bathrooms!"}
{"text":"Went here on our last trip to Vegas. We got the Bobbie. The sandwich was good but it would have been better if it wasnt cold. I know its served that way and people love it but I just wish there was a hot option."}
{"text":"I ordered over the phone to pick up because I was in a rush. I ordered 2 salads and a sandwich. When I want in to pick up the order they didn't even start the sandwich yet so I had to wait for that to be made. Then when I got home they messed up our dressing, there was also meat missing from the sandwich. I was not impressed needless to say."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the sandwiches, don't know if I'd return for them though. I had the meatball sub. Maybe I should try something else but the recommendations I asked for didn't sound appealing."}
{"text":"wow, just wow. 

i had the italian and it was great, fresh deli meats soft bread and friendly service to boot?

i managed to try some of my friends' bobbies and capastrami and those blew me out of the water as well.

this place has interesting sandwiches that dont fail to deliver.
oh and pricing is fair enough and what you would come to expect.
they could be charging more.

4.5/5.0"}
{"text":"The Bobbie may be the perfect sandwich ever!  I wish there was a Capriotti's near our house in Laguna Beach!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this, and it did not disappoint.  This review is only for the Capastrami, which was heavenly and ideal.  Meat was not too salty, portions are huge, and the mix of slaw, meat, dressing and bread were perfect.  This is in the food court so it's easily accessible if you're inside the Red Rock casino.  Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"One of the vest philly cheese steaks i have ever had in my belly for sure so much flavor in every bit"}
{"text":"Pre-order your sandwich online, trust me. This will save you a lot of time and embarrassment from drooling on the floor. 

Capriotti's is known for the, \"Bobbi\", which is basically Thanksgiving on a roll. The last few times I've had this it was just ok, but had too much mayo. This time it was all about the hotness, a hot sandwich that is, the Chicken Cheese Steak. This is a beast of a sandwich packed with Philly style grilled chicken, melted Provolone cheese, but with some added mushrooms, onions, and both hot and sweet peppers. 

This is my new favorite. The chicken was plentiful, sliced thin, and seared just like a Philly cheese steak, along with the mushrooms, onions and cheese this was an amazing sandwich. I highly recommend adding both sweet and hot peppers for some great flavor balancing and gaining a new level of love for this poultry packed meal. 

Sorry Bobbie, there's a new flightless bird in town and they aren't clucking around."}
{"text":"Worst cap experience in my life they  are giving cap a bad rep with horrible customers service nd food not up to cap standards please retrain or get rid of these employees!!!!!!!!!
Btw i would give them zero stars but it wont let me"}
{"text":"Probably the best sub shop around. The menu is not too extensive and the choices are just right. I always got the Bobbie, you just gotta love having a turkey dinner on a month that doesn't start with a N. The last trip I tried the Capistrami for a change and was in sub heaven. Needs table seating."}

{"text":"This one is in a little strip mall... off of Paseo and Stephanie... (there are others around Las Vegas..)

Really like this sandwich place... quality sandwiches with quality ingredients. I go here when I'm jonesing for a good sammy.  This beats Subway all to heck.

I like the Bobbie, the pastrami and the Grilled Italian.  Pretty much all their sandwiches are really tasty... highly recommend the Hot or Grilled ones.

Their \"medium\" is 12\" and big enough for 2 people.
Their \"large\" is 20\" and it's huge... so if you're super hungry... or have 4 kids that can share a sandwich... this is a good way to go.

They don't do sides... but they have an assortment of chips to choose from."}
{"text":"My sister buys from them at least once or twice a month but I am usually not around when she's having her Bobbie fix.

Well this time she brought it to me and man, that sandwich is HUGE!!!

It's basically a Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich, served cold not hot but I guess you can always nuke it or bake it a little if you want the real Thanksgiving feel. 

I wasn't too sure how I felt about the cranberry stuff... And the stuffing looked funny... But after the first bite, I was hooked!  I can see why my sis likes it so much.  
My 2 year nephew loves the cranberry stuff, I think he'll put that on everything he eats if he could.  I don't blame him, I would too haha

Everyone who had it was raving about how awesome the sandwich was and where my sis got from.

They had also gotten the hot pastrami sandwich which was a little too salty for my taste buds.  So I'll stick to the Bobbie.  Delish!"}
{"text":"I tried the Philly cheese steak, the small 9\" was plenty for me and i believe it was about $7 w tax. I also joined the text offers program they were advertising on the counter i got a free drink that day. The sandwich was good and would definately go back. They have a variety of sandwiches from the veggie to the meats, salads, etc. The restaurant is close to Arizona State University so there's hardly any parking you have to walk no way around it. The place was clean and had a few tables not a lot so could get packed during busy times, i believe they had a patio as well."}
{"text":"I base this review SOLELY on their steak and cheese. Get it how you would when you lived back home on the east coast!

It's delicious, and the best steak and cheese in Vegas. If I lived back home it would be a 4/5 stars.

Be careful and don't belly up and order a large (like I always do!). They will literally hand you a sub that is larger than your arm. I do it all the time and always know that 24\" sub (or however long it is) is mine when I see them bring it to the counter.

If you don't like steak and cheese, they have another special sub called the Bobbie. I eat these about 3 times a week during the World Series of Poker when I'm at the Rio everyday (Official Sandwich of the WSOP YO!). Roasted turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce... don't knock it til you try it!"}
{"text":"Slower than a constipated shlt...they're not even busy and it's been nearly 30 f'ing minutes to get my order."}
{"text":"I go to many of their locations and I have to say this is my favorite. It seems like everything tastes more fresh. Definitely better than the one near Anthem!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's is always consistent. This location has a nice and friendly team. I just hate the wait when you forget to call ahead. But their quality meat and cheeses make it worthwhile in the end."}
{"text":"Yet another location scrimping on the cheese! The guy was really nice so I hate writing a bad review but a cheese steak needs enough cheese! And my peppers and onions tasted really burnt. This is my FAVORITE sandwhich so I know what it should taste like, and it's laggin I gave 3 stars cause the guys was sweet enough to split the sandwhich in 3s thanks for the good service, just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"Love this franchise. .however iv visited this location 2 separate times and have been a little disappointed with my favorite sub ..the cheese steak with peppers and onions.. it's always lacking on the CHEESE part of the cheese steak. .I order this every time at multiple locations and they are the only location skimpin on the cheese!! Did convince my boyfriend it's the best cheese steak  He'd ever had!! (After sneaking extra cheese from his sandwich to melt onto my own)"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are delicious. Anything with turkey is going to be amazing. Of course if you want an amazing gluttonous experience, try the Bobbie sandwich. Turkey, Stuffing, Cranberry sauce on a roll. It sounds really gross, but it's delicious!"}
{"text":"I did have the pleasure of visiting this restaurant again when it was not as busy.  I had the Bobbie and I must say it was great.  The turkey was fresh and the dressing was plentiful.  I like more mayonnaise on my sandwiches than the usually add, but they were glad to accommodate me.  My husband enjoyed his sandwich and my grandson ordered the meatball sub,  he wanted a large one and I must say he ate the whole sandwich in one setting.  It is definitely a place we shall return to again and again."}
{"text":"Amazing! All of their subs are made to order and delicious. I got the cheesesteak the first time we went, and its amazing. The breads, meats and cheeses taste so fresh. They even screwed my order up once, and very kindly and apologetically made me another sandwich (and took care and time to do it like the first, they didn't hand it to me right away), and allowed me to keep the first one (which I gave to my boyfriend who loved it). The slaw be jo is awesome, and so is the cole turkey. Don't let the stuffing and cranberry keep you from ordering it, it was amazing and totally not what we expected. The Prosciuttini is great as well, some of the thickest prosciutto I've ever had. We frequent Capriotti's at least once a week. The ONLY downside is there is limited seating if you want to eat there, and they often run out of beverages in the cooler they have. Multiple times we have just walked next door to get a drink while our sandwiches are being made."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow. I had the Capastrami and it was fantastic. The meat was tender and plenty of it. It had just the right amount of slaw and sauce to not overwhelm the sandwich.

Service was fine. Most of the tables were dirty,but that's my only knock on the place."}
{"text":"This location is a joke. The first time we ordered a cheesesteak with mayo, lettuce, tomato to pick up. We grab the order and go home to find our sandwhich is just cheese with mayo, lettuce, tomato - we called to have the order fixed, no apology was given.
The second time, we attempt to order on the phone and was put on hold - I had my boyfriend stay on the phone as we were on our way there. They never took us off hold, we walked in still on hold to see them not even busy. 
Granted, if you actually receive what you ordered the food is good."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheesesteak  9 inch. 10.00 and no meat. I could of bought 2 foot longs at subway and 1 of them would have had more meat on them. The service was fine, but 30.00 bucks for 3 sandwiches and no meat, whats the point."}
{"text":"Dinner time on a Wed eve and I ordered the Med Capastrami.  Service was lightning fast and it came in a butcher paper roll. As others posted, the 12\" sandwiches are long, bit into the first bite and the ample hot pastrami nearly seared me.  Enjoyed the Cole slaw and fresh bread with sauce. Yummy...will def be back"}
{"text":"Ordered two sandwiches to go. The food was freshly prepared, the bread was good. It wasn't quite as amazing as I remembered the Las Vegas location; but it was good and a smidgen closer. :-)"}
{"text":"I'm convinced this is the best sandwich. It really is Thanksgiving on a bun.  Anytime I'm visiting Las Vegas I have to indulge and get a Bobbie. A small is plenty for one person, but you might as well go big. I always get the large and save half for a snack. I believe a large is 20 inches and a small is 9 inches. Don't forget to download their app and get $2 off your first order. Each time you visit you get credit when scanning the coupon after you pay. Not sure if it was just the specific location I was at, but if I remember correctly they used to just scan your purchase and you'd get credit. Anyways basically after 10 subs you get one  free! If you're in a rush you can also order online. Tip: This location is pretty busy during lunch so I'd just download the app and place an online order. Parking can also be a challenge, bring quarters to feed the meters.
So if you're into house shredded turkey, stuffing,cranberry sauce, rolls, and mayonnaise try the Bobbie. You won't be disappointed. Don't forget to get a bag of chips to complete your monster sandwich."}
{"text":"There's only one good sandwich here, and it's the Bobbie. Capriotti's is overpriced and I suggest that you look elsewhere for  decent sandwich."}
{"text":"I placed a yelp delivery order. Easy to order and arrived on time. My hubs ordered the Capastrami Sub and he said it's his new fav sandwich. I order the Bobby and it was great. I also order a kids grilled cheese meal but they only delivered the grilled cheese not the juice and side. I tried to call just to let them know and I could reach anyone. Overall we'll love to enjoy this food again but we'll eat there instead."}
{"text":"My friend that lives in Vegas recommended Capriotti's for their great sandwiches and \"local\" vibe. So when we found out they have a branch in Boulder City (and there's absolutely nothing between the Hoover Dam and the Grand Canyon South Rim besides gas stations/rest stops), we knew we had to stop by and grab sandwiches. 

I picked a cold sandwich since it would be sitting in the car (at ~40 degrees) for most of the day. When we decided to eat (probably 4-5 hours after we brought them), it was still good. The bread is soft and the turkey tasted like real turkey (and not the fake kind some delis have). It was a good on-the-go meal and their packaging makes it super easy to eat in a moving car. 

The guys ended up getting their Thanksgiving dinner style sandwich, which they also ate cold. I don't think they complained - but they were also probably just super hungry! 

If you get the chance, I highly recommend Capriotti's for a quick and delicious lunch!"}
{"text":"As Capriotti's go in general, they are amazing. Delicious food, friendly service. This one...not so much. I've gone back several times and so has my boyfriend and the service here SUCKS. When I went last week, I walked up to the counter and had two employees look at me and then go back to their respective jobs. No \"Be with you in a minute,\" or \"Welcome to Capriotti's.\" They just looked at me. Then, when someone came to take my order, still no welcome, just, \"What can I get ya?\" Getting a thank you from someone there is like trying to get cake away from a fat guy. They're the only Caps to screw up my order too which is hard to do when I'm the only one who has ordered a sandwich. Yeah, I go back because it's close to home, but really, you're better off to go to the one on Rainbow."}
{"text":"I'm rating them 3 stars only because it's two guys working behind the counter. 9 customers ahead of us. Props to the two guys working age taking these orders but they need two more workers and there's no manager on duty. The manager obviously doesn't care about the store/business."}
{"text":"Call my crazy but i was highly underwhelmed by this place. I stopped in looking for a yummy sandwich for lunch and ended up with a mediocre one at best. I ordered the roast beef sub and while I wasn't expecting it to big chunks of roast beef like it was I was however expecting there to be some moisture somewhere. The meat was as dry as can be to the point of being hard to swallow. I should mention that i did get mine with all the veggies and oil and vinegar so it wasn't just meat and bread there should have been enough. The flavor was ok but nothing great and the lack of moisture didn't help bring anything special to the forefront. 

i may go back and give them another shot but considering the price was a bit on the higher side I am not sure how motivated I am to risk it."}
{"text":"We were hungry and lazy to leave the office. It was a Thursday, the longest day of the week, and we wanted good food--fast. A coworker of mine suggested a sandwich place literally around the corner from Industrial Road called Capriotti's. Apparently the food there is divine and I had to try it. Falling for another suggestion of great food, and seeing on the internet it was also listed as The Best of Las Vegas a couple years in a row (like all the other restaurants here), I gave it a chance.

My supervisor suggested \"The Bobbie\", a trademarked sammie from this shop. I took the suggestion, and about fifteen minutes later the cold sub came to my desk. It was nicely wrapped in traditional butcher paper, and a fast handwritten \"Bobbie No Mayo\" skewed the front. I ripped the tape, unrolled the culinary package and saw a great sandwich. Nay--a beauty. I am a person in love with Thanksgiving all year round, and this sandwich combined a Thanksgiving dinner in a roll. A large roll to be exact. The turkey was shredded and a great portion was given for meat. I could see the purplish-red cranberry sauce with whole cranberries along the entire thing, and a great topping--stuffing--crammed on top.

The first bite was heavenly, a beautiful flip of my hungry tastebuds and mind. I must say that this sandwich is--without exxargerating--a beautiful symphony of comfort food with the addition of bread to hold it all. The stuffing was fantastic, although clearly boxed, nicely done. The turkey, although somewhat dry in some parts, was juiced up by a great hint of cranberry sauce inbetween.

The twelve inches did not survive, and I almost fell asleep an hour later.

Most sandwiches require a side dish of chips or potato salad of some sort, yet this particular sammy from Capriotti's needed nothing but itself. That evening, I had to share the discovery with my spouse, who happily agreed after a twelve inch that this place is worth waiting in line for. The best part of the shop itself is that they sell Tastykakes--a beautiful junk dessert creation that I adore.

If you love great sandwiches, try Capriotti's in Vegas or anywhere in the U.S. for that matter. Since they have the honor of being first on my critique, and because their taste in sandwiches literally rocked my world to a whole new level, I give them the fantastic, personal rating:

5/5!"}
{"text":"Located right beside the In-Out Burger (which I enjoyed more for cheap eats), they had a unique menu. I tried the Bobbie which so many yelpers raved about, but found it to be a bit disappointing. The turkey was a little dry, the stuffing was lacking, but the cranberry sauce made a surprsingly tasty hit. I would eat there again, but it would not be on top of my list of places to go.

Good: 
- Big cheap sandwiches.
- The Bobbie can be found here.

Bad: 
- Not as amazing as many make it out to be.
- A little dirty, but I've seen worse."}
{"text":"A very nice sandwich and quick, friendly service. I had a meatball sandwich which was a good balance of meatballs, marinara sauce and melted cheese. The server as extremely nice, warm and genuine.  I am. It expecting perfection and being pretentious."}
{"text":"Love this place, love the Bobbie, an awesome sandwich!!  Service is always prompt and courteous.  I never order anything else.  Eat here usually once a week."}
{"text":"Best Sandwiches ive ever had... at first you think GROSS who would eat that? But , if you give them a try you wont regret it! The Capastrami and the Bobbie are amazing! The taste is great for the price. All my friends from out of town or anyone who hasnt tried cappriottis I always take them and they are always glad I did! love it!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, my experience was very underwhelming. I ordered a Bobbie and only got a Bob; where is the stuffing? My sandwich was empty. So much bread. The soup was contrived. And just when I thought I couldn't be anymore disappointed, I bit into the cookie. Dat Capastrami was on point tho. I highly recommend it. 

Thanks for the forks."}
{"text":"I had them cater a huge pool party I was having, everyone loved the diverse range of sandwiches and sides. I wouldn't hesitate to do that again."}
{"text":"My experience with this store has been pleasant and filling. I wish they were cheaper but I dont mind paying more for a more flavorful experience. They could use a little bit of remodeling though.  

I ordered the bobby and the girl made it really fast Within 5 mins i was in and out Cant beat that!! A delicious Quality sandwich made fresh for me :D.

Thank you for your hard work and for making me feel like a valued customer."}
{"text":"Permanently out of business.  Their phone is still hooked up, but signs are posted at location.  Their customer service was horrid anyway."}
{"text":"Hard to believe places like Subway exist when Capriottis is in town. They got it right from the toppings to the most important part- their amazing bread. Don't miss getting a sandwich here."}
{"text":"I've been to Capriotti's twice and both times Ive had a tasty sandwich.  They have a nice selection of cold and warm sandwiches plus some signature items.  The key to any good sandwich however is the bread and lets just say Capriotti's is no Subway....and that's a good thing.   You have a choice of small or large but to be honest I thought the small was pretty darn big, so if you order a large it better be for 2 people or because you just helped a friend move into his third floor apartment without an elevator.  

The first time I went in there, I grabbed a Capicola sandwich which is always one of my favorite.  They were generous with the meat and the veggies that accompanie it were fresh.   The second time decided to throw caution into the wind and I got one of their signature sandwiches, The Capistrammi.  Talk about a heart attack in wrapping!  Thats not to say it wasn't good, because it was delicious but considering it was stacked with warm, buttery pastrami, coleslaw, mayo and russian dressing, you better not be on Cholesterol meds when you try it!  Next time I go there I want to try their other famous signature sandwich, the Bobby.  It looks like a  full thanksgiving meal in sandwich form.  I should start clearing room in my stomach now and I'll probably be ready for it sometime early next month!

Prices are a tad on the higher side, but nothing outrageous.  You're getting  a higher quality sandwich than at a lot of other joints, so its totally reasonable.  This particular location is at the Red Rock Casino but it still has the same full menu as you would find at any of their other locations.  

Great spot to grab a bite before the movies right next door...unless its a movie you really want to see because you might lapse into a food coma!"}
{"text":"The Bobbie...never had a sub quite like it. Hand pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce...it's a thanksgiving meal in sandwich form. Every ingredient perfectly compliments each other. Never thought the combination could be so delicious!

I've also had the Slaw-Be-Jo (roast beef, provolone, russian dressing, cole-slaw)...it hits the spot especially if you're a fan of cole-slaw like me, but it's not as memorable as the Bobbie.  The Bobbie, the one sandwich that rules them all!!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty sandwich shop. Stopped here on my way home. I got the turkey with cranberry and stuffing. It was pretty good...I should've gone for the small sandwich. I'll definitely come back to try something else."}
{"text":"PROS: 
I had just flown into Vegas and was in need of food before I head to the clubs to get wasted! My friends who are Las Vegas residents swear by this place but I don't understand why. The only Pro this place deserves in convenience. 

CONS: 
I ordered my sandwich..they were barely paying attention, I had to repeat my order 3 times. How hard is it to understand Turkey on wheat with extra mustard? Extra Mayo? The guys said? NO!!!!! Extra mustard! YELLOW! YELLOW! YELLOW!!!!!! then to top off this horrible experience, the dude hands me my sandwich (foot long) without a bag while he gave my other friends their sandwiches in bags. 

HELLLLLLO!?!?!?! Can I get a bag? dumbass! 
Got home, the sandwich sucked! Wish I would went to Subway! 

FINAL ANSWER: GO to Subway!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. A new guilty pleasure every time I am in town for a trade show. The Bobbie is an amazing sandwich that was so good that I went back for more two more times on the same trip. Real turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce....damn this is good.  If  you are a fan of thanksgiving, you will love this sandwich.

I also tried the Capistrami later in the same week, while good, not nearly as good as the Bobbie.  If you have a few  friends get a large of each and they will happily cut them in thirds for you.

I am a big eater, and the large is enough for two people, but two larges were good for our party of three.

 If you live in Vegas or you are just visiting, go get one of these bad boys.  
Looking forward to my next trip in May."}
{"text":"We went by this place and saw a sign that said \"Voted America's Best Sandwich\" and thought we should check it out.  So here is the good news first: The customer service in this place is AWESOME!  The staff is very knowledgeable about the food and can make recommendations on the spot.  The owner was so friendly and happy to talk to us since it was our first time in the shop.  He joked with us at the end of our meal also when we asked to take the rest home.  A fairly young and hip team who seemed very excited to hand you your order which I found refreshing since I am usually a Subway person.  Now for the not so good news:  We tried the Capastrami sandwich after reading what sounded like an awesome description on the menu board.  Now I like a great pastrami with coleslaw and some sort of dressing, but this thing was SATURATED in mayo.  Between the overly dressed coleslaw and the Russian dressing, it was just too over powering for what was actually really good pastrami.  The bread was really good, so it was sad to have such a drenched sandwich.  Next time I will take the advice of the owner and try their famous \"Bobbie Sub\" which looks like Thanksgiving dinner on a sub."}
{"text":"This time I went for the Bobbie and I was much happier.  My visit to the Mesa location was excellent on the customer service side just like the one in Scottsdale.  The people are friendly, knowledgeable, and seem only interested in making sure their customers are well taken care of.  This location is in a new development that has tons of food choices and I would definitely say they should be on the top of anyone's list."}
{"text":"family ordered the philly cheesesteak and the italian to share. it was ordered to go so we could eat at home. we ordered mushrooms on the philly and they forgot them. the philly cheesesteak was really bland and the meat tasted dry. no cheesewiz was used here. we got peppers in a side cup to put on ourselves and that didn't help with flavoring. the italian was the more flavorful of the two, but not my favorite. i have experienced better from capriottes. hopefully last night was just an off night from them from watching the game. please step your game back up capriottes because i use to love you."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch because we kept hearing how good this place was. We tried the capastrami and the chicken cheese steak with sweet peppers. I gotta say it was pretty darn good! The bread was super soft and the Cole slaw was yummy! 

The service was absolutely great!"}
{"text":"Don't bother calling. You have to go in I guess. They give you the runaround on the phone. I gave up. Your choice. I won't call again."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed. We paid $30 for 3 sandwiches. the Caprastami had NO CHEESE which supposed to come with it. Cheese Steak & Italian Sub were very good.  Food rating is 3stars

Service is why I gave 1 star because we walked in and no one greeted us, no welcome to Caps, no acknowledgement. We stood there for 5 mins until one girl said \"what are you waiting for?\" WHAT!?!?! I said i have not ordered. Meanwhile there are several workers there. One of the girls were calling ready orders but never looked our way. Terrible. we will not visit this location anymore."}
{"text":"I am not much of a sandwich person, but when the italian place next door didn't have their pasta ready (it was 10 am) Capriottis it was for brunch. I ordered the Capastrami sandwich. It was after I ordered that I saw the sign \"The Boggie, voted americas best sandwich\" - I'll get you next time. Not taking away anything from Capastrami, it had so much meat in it that there was little room for the condiments :D

The place looks spick and span with a iron-chef type kitchen look (that's just what I thought of it). But it just adds to the experience, and these guys really put a lot of care into making your sandwiches. Customer for life - now open up some shops in NY will you? :)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. The small size is more than enough for the average person. I had the Capastrami and my husband had the Cole Turkey. The meat and buns were very fresh; bakery quality. For sure would come again. BTW the meat was not the pressed and formed kind you sometimes find at sandwich shops. Also not being a fan of coleslaw...this was very good!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Capriotti's, so I really wanted to go, because I heart sandwiches! They have a strong menu of favorite's and some more innovated things. I had the Bobby, which has really shredded turkey (not deli sliced), stuffing, and cranberry relish. This is something I wouldn't necessarily choose, but I heard it was really good. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. The stuffing was delicious, and the turkey was waaaaay better than deli turkey, and the cranberry added the perfect touch ( if I had it again I would have added brown mustard b/c that would make it a 5 in my eyes)"}
{"text":"Went in to get a sandwich and a salad. I had seen that they changes on their menu. I asked if they could make this creation salad that was on their menu before. The manager Donna was very rude and said no.  I then ask for a BBQ turkey salad with no BBQ sauce. She then got involved with the register. I ask for 2oz extra turkey grilled onions and mushrooms. She was very upset. The sandwich was ham and cheese. She wanted to charge me over $26.00. I ask her what did she ring up she said what I ordered. We went through it and she added 2 salads. After she changed it the bill was over $21.00 very high price lunch for two. I just bought a house in Henderson in February and I use to go there almost every day. I don't think I will eat there again. I have a sandwich and ice cream place in Anaheim Ca. ( Togos and Baskin Robbins). I would never have a manager that treat my customers they way I was treated."}
{"text":"Getting chaeuffered around with a friend from UNLV we got hungry. He said we HAD to have the best sandwich EVER. Yeah right.... Well lets just say I'm back home in San Jose. I'm having dreams about the cheese steak with chopped up pepperchinis and jalapenos speckled with ground pepper. Vegas... I'll be back... and it wont be without a visit to Capriattis. Lawry's I don't miss you at all. Neither does my wallet."}
{"text":"There are lots of good options for subs in Scottsdale but this isn't one of them. It has so clear die Hard fans and I read all these great reviews and was eager to try this place. Sadly it does not live up to its reputation. Very little meat on the subs and not great cuts of meat. I would equate the quality of Caprottis to Subway."}
{"text":"This is one of the two capriotti's I've been too. Which is a bit more convenient for me, since its just down the street from where I live. The second one, is at Aliante Station. 

Focusing on this Sandwich Shop, I have to say that this is unique in it's own sense. There are some things I do like about it, and other things that I don't like. But the most important thing is, their sandwiches are great. I'm not sure about other Capriotti's, but I know that Aliante doesn't have it, but this Capriotti's has their 20 inch sandwich. That's why I like this place I love their LARGE sandwiches. I do like their staff, which is nice and friendly. Despite the fact of them being busy, they still tend to be upbeat. 

On the other hand, even though their location is convenient. Mainly off Craig and MLK next to Pet Smart and Home Depot. It is a small sandwich shop. When it gets busy, its kind of uncomfortable standing around for a sandwich. They only have 3 small tables, and a few worn out chairs. The floor itself, seen better days. 

Overall, I would suggest this place for their sandwiches, but not so much on dining in. They do have a few tables outside, but I would just go their for pick up. Their sandwiches are great, their staff is great. That's all I need to go to Capriotti's for."}
{"text":"Used a yelp coupon for the meal, but still would pay full price. The bobbie is amazing, the turkey they use really makes it stand out against the competition. Only issue with this location is the parking. Slim to none. Still worth the hassle."}
{"text":"A good above-average sandwich that I would probably enjoy more often if I had more reason to be in that part of town.  The radius of their sandwiches are ideal for eating as they aren't too wide, too tall,  or too sloppy.  The meats are good cuts and generous, their bread being the only real weak link."}
{"text":"Just left after savoring a cheesesteak with onions and hot peppers.  Delicious!  I'm an old cheesesteak  guy that grew up in South Jersey,  these guys do it right!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sandwich shop in the heart of Old Town.  Super tasty selection.  Fresh ingredients.  Friendly workers.

Parking can be a challenge at times and seating is limited.  We usually try to grab a table outside.

Each time we visit Old Town we eat at Capriotti's.  It's on our \"must stop\" list.  Located right next to the great shopping area, it's in a prime location and offers sensational sandwiches.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Location of it is inside the food court in the green valley resort and casino. Recommend parking by the movie theatres, since the food court is closest to it. Cole wasn't the best, but we still got extra. Service was great. Got our food fast. Only main downfall, they ran out of bread and we had to wait almost half an hour."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak had great reviews so I tried it. Actually it was a bit dry. Surprised but I really enjoy the classic bobby so I'll look elsewhere for the next cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Every Vegas local's favorite sandwich shop. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but the most popular sandwich is The Bobbie. It's Thanksgiving on a sub roll, and they do it perfectly at Capriotti's."}
{"text":"I can't express how happy I am that Capriotties has made it to Scottsdale. I'm totally addicted to this Vegas based sandwich chain, and if there is an opportunity to get the Bobbie outside of Las Vegas, I'm jumping on it. Please go in and try the Bobbie...if the cranberry sauce makes you second guess ordering it, you can always ask for it without cranberry, it's still awesome!"}
{"text":"Cheerful staff! Amazing sandwiches. The Bobbie is still my favorite and this location made it the same as my go-to location closer to my house."}
{"text":"Super awesome staff, the manager there's a great guy. Kathryn's extremely nice and the whole crew hooked up some delicious sandwiches. Overall the way experience I've ever had at any Capriotti's."}
{"text":"I should update to 5 star for a few reasons. Even though they had a hick-up and kept the phone off the hook that is not normal. What is normal is good service and great tasting sandwiches, chips, and decent soup. 

I've ordered online with a few little glitches but overall good experience eating here. Been dozens of times before starting yelp and I turned several others in to Bobby freaks. 

Bobby is the epic Thanksgiving style sandwich, be sure to get it made heated up. Cheese steak is good, be sure to add onions and mushrooms. Chips are thin and perfect. Soup is decent at least, not same as the rest of the quality items but good. They don't have much more on the menu but they are constantly best at what they do so 5 star seems fair.  

I'll be back often and suggest you check them out. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Comparing Capriotti's to Subway is like comparing some place like Red Robin to McDonald's. Subway is good fast food, but Capriotti's sandwiches are works of art.  The Bobby of course stands out, but the Capastrami and Slaw B Joe are real treats.  Want something more traditional? Have their Italian.  Their bread is wonderful.  Be sure to call ahead, so they have your order ready when you get there."}
{"text":"I used to hate this place but then I realized they're the only place that comes close to a real Italian grinder.  Toast and dress it yourself for more authenticity."}
{"text":"Love this place! The cheese steak is my favorite!"}
{"text":"OK so I love a bobbie, i'll repeat I love a bobbie and I am a sucker for turkey day leftovers.  That being said I would give this place 1 star if it wasn't for that one sandwich.  Their bread is dry, the prices are kind of expensive and the service in any of the caps I have ever been to isn't anything spectacular (I have been to this one the most).  I guess the cap pastrami is OK too but their cold subs are tasteless, just horrible, and this is usually my favorite type of sandwich especially on a hot summer day. I recently got a small turkey sandwich with all the fixings and I ate half of it and I just gave up on it, it might have been the worst turkey sandwich I have ever had in my like and I am not fooling. The bread is the most important part of a sandwich and that is the number one thing caps is lacking, also their toppings on cold subs are plain so the whole thing comes over as boring filler."}
{"text":"Scott called (the new manager/GM?) Not sure his title. Very friendly. Explained what has been going on over there. Was more than gracious to fix all my issues. I can not wait to order from them again! Their food really is the best. And if you haven't had their clam chowder you truly are missing out! I appreciate a manager who takes action immediately to resolve an issue. Thanks Scott and good luck on your new position!"}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by this place. Went with the ham and cheese cold sub. Felt that they kind of had limited sandwich fixin's, pretty much just the usual lettuce, tomato and onion. They didn't even have banana peppers so I got sweet peppers- blah. Not the same. Wished they had Italian dressing instead of oil and vinegar. Got my sandwich dry and then ended up going to the pizza joint next door and getting a side of Italian dressing (for 75 cents). A positive is that I got the 9\" small and it was HUGE and was like $6.99. Would I return? Eh, I'd like to try out other places instead."}
{"text":"Great location in Down Town Summerlin.  Came in today, on a Saturday.. Jovial young kids (high school-ish).  Nice smiles.. A good valiant effort.  For all the joking that was happening in the food prep area and loud laughter as the employees enjoyed themselves .. The dining area was unclean and messy tables.  We had to wipe down our own table and floors were dirty.  

We probably will not come back to this location as the responsibility level leaves one to wonder what's happening with the cleanliness in the back.  

Our food was decent and served by an eager young staff.  Smiles are there, just not the maturity level or leadership."}
{"text":"I would've given this place zero stars, if I could've. The staff is comprised of adolescent meat heads with no concept of customer service. I placed a phone order for pick-up and was told that my order would be ready in 20 minutes. I thought that was already an excessive amount of time to wait for two sandwiches, but what can you do. When I arrived, there was one guy up front who fumbled with the cash register and engaged in meaningless banter before he finally sent for a cook. Um, no...wait, what?? You mean I've already waited this long and you haven't even started making the meals? I didn't say this, of course, but I sure as hell was thinking it. There were no other customers in sight. Fifteen minutes later, the same guy who took my payment said that I could take a bag of chips as a courtesy for waiting. I grabbed a small bag. But after waiting for another 10 minutes I thought better of it and took a large bag. I thought: \"Pffft, screw this! I've already waited far too long for a couple of sandwiches that should have taken 10 minutes tops to make!\" Keep in mind that no one was there when I showed up. By the time the cook finally finished preparing my order, another guy had already come and gone to pick up his to-go order and two more customers had arrived. I was fuming by this point. So I go to leave with my food and large bag of chips and the cook (not the guy who offered me the chips in the first place, mind you) had the gall to shout at me in front of the other customers and say: \"Um, you can have a SMALL bag of chips.\" I was done. I will NEVER, EVER go back to this location AGAIN. Nope, not even once."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are one of my favorites meals and Capriotti's makes a consistently good sandwich at all locations that I have been to.
The staff is friendly and they greet all customers. The customer service at this sandwich shop stands out, friendly staff can make a mediocre food experience seem a little less meh. My last visit to this location was my first taste of the Capritotti's vegan experience, so it differs from my past \"Bobbie\" experiences. I ordered the meatless chikn cheesesteak, minus the cheese and mayo - and add ALL veggies. The meatless chikn left an aftertaste and I would have just preferred an all veggie sandwich. I ordered fries, which were fresh, crispy and a good deal at $2.29 for a large container. This location is open late. The seating is plentiful if you don't mind the casino smoke and the wait time is short. The prices are reasonable, my meatless cheesesteak was $7+.

Enjoy, 4 stars for vegan options / 4 stars for non vegan options."}
{"text":"I stopped into Capriotti's yesterday after reading dozens of enthusiastic reviews. I decided to get a 9\" Bobbie with hot mustard and a 9\" meatball with American cheese and fried onions to go. Ten minutes later, I was back out on the street with two handsomely wrapped sandwiches and an orange crush. 

Needless to say, they did not disappoint! I personally preferred the Bobbie over the meatball--the turkey is extraordinarily well-prepared. The meatball was a contender, but I like a bit more garlic and zest in the sauce. Nonetheless, I'll order it again, especially considering its convenient location off the Strip. On a happy side note, Capriotti's stocks Herr's ketchup chips by the bag!"}
{"text":"Best cheesesteak in vegas! Quick service, nice and helpful staff. Look forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"Totally satisfied with what I ordered here . Went with the veggie sandwich . Owner I'm believing made it his style . The \"works\" . Best veggie sandwich I've ever had . I guess healthy shake is connected to this place . Got a smoothie from there which also really good . Great service and good energy here . I will return ."}
{"text":"Love, love, love the grilled Italian!  

It was around 12:15 on a Thursday so I knew I'd hit the lunch crowd.
A little different than other Capriotti's -- you have to figure out who to put your order in with.
There's a cash register as soon as you walk in and a long, tall counter.  There were people lined up so I assumed I would wait behind the last person standing at the counter.  Nope, they took the order of whoever they were looking at randomly, even people who came in after I did.  Oh well, I was on lunch and my mouth was watering for that grilled italian that I didn't even care.  I just spoke up the next time one of the employees looked my way :)

Once I put my order in it went quickly.  The staff are very nice and fast (and the ladies are cute).

Thanks Capriotti's"}
{"text":"Dang it.  Just went to the one in Red Rock for a quick lunch.  Was ignored standing there. Two people working, one in the grill, the other looked at me and walked into the back.  One guy was waiting for his food....didn't see any other customers.  Went to port o subs down the street instead.  Gave a great review last time.  Disappointed now.  Hope there is another capriottis nearby next time."}
{"text":"We have ate at Capriotti's several times and have yet to be disappointed.  The food is always fresh and good.

We hadn't realized that we walked in 20 minutes to closing time.  They didn't try to rush us out and were very nice."}
{"text":"When I went in and said is it possible to get something made with all vegetables and no meat or cheese? The guy behind the counter said yes, we call those salads. We laughed, but he made me an awesome all-vegetable sub. Seriously, if you are not afraid to ask for what you want, people are happy to serve you delicious food. The bread at this place was really amazing. I would go back just for that. Plus, nice people, Good service, and very convenient to where we wanted to go. Open 24 hours"}
{"text":"I don't know exactly how to write this review, the food, as normal, was awesome but today I was treated less than respectful from the manager (?) Jennifer.  I had won a couple of 9\" subs that I had brought a friend, who had never been there before, along to have lunch with me.  I showed her my codes and the text that said they were good until 11/30-she proceeded to rudely tell me it was expired but she would honor it \"this\" time.  I was totally embarrassed in front of my friend because it was all spelled out in a text from their office.  After we ate & when no one was at the counter, I went back up to tell her she had embarrassed me and made me feel like a idiot in front of my friend.  She yelled and said she never called me a idiot, which I never said she did. I work in customer service & I can't believe how she treated me.  My friend was also appalled, I've never seen this woman before in the other times I've been there. I came from the Goodyear area and don't know about coming back.  I would have lost my job had I acted that way to a guest.  Their food is great but WOW, kindness was lacking today!"}
{"text":"This location is excellent.  Clean, stylish, roomy dining area.  Sandwiches are delicious and they don't skimp on the ingredients.  Quick & friendly staff, can't get any better for a sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"This place is so good and is always busy but worth the wait.  The lady was so good at taking care of all the customers. You come in place an order then wait till your orders ready to pay. 

We got a medium meat ball sub with light sauce and  provolone. One of my wife's favorite   

I got the homemade turkey sandwich with lettuce tomatoes and provolone cheese and light mayo ... The best ! You can really taste the fresh made turkey  
 I really got to try the Bobbi !"}
{"text":"It's adjacent to a gas station so keep your eyes peeled. I had the balsamic chicken salad with the turkey Cole sandwich. Both were really, really good. Ample space to sit inside and you don't feel like you're at a gas station hole. Service was quick and kind. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Capriottis's
You haven't had a sandwich until you have a Capriottis

Capriotti's Sandwich Shop is definitely the place to go for a good bite to eat. I would recommend Capriottis to anyone who is searching for something beyond \"Just a Sandwich Shop\". Capriottis is very clean and warmly decorate. The Staff is knowledgeable and very friendly.

On my first visit to Capriottis I had the \"Bobbie\" which is one of Capriottis signature sandwiches and for good reason.  The Bobbie is stuffed full of homemade turkey (that's right, homemade roasted turkey, not processed deli meat), cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. The 'Bobbie\" sandwich was amazing to say the least.  If turkey isn't for you Capriotti's offers a variety of traditional deli sandwiches, cheese-steaks, as well as specialty sandwiches.  I plan on trying the cheese steak on my next visit.

The service at Capriottis is always fast & friendly. The atmosphere reminds me of that of a small-town deli sandwich shop and the food is always consistent and great.  I could keep writing everything I enjoyed but I think I have given you enough to try Capriotti's for yourself! Who knows maybe I will see you there!"}
{"text":"Danny (blonde dude) needs an award for best sandwich making skills! Tried a vegetarian Phillies cheese. He went out of his way to recommend other toppings to make my meatless sandwich experience amazing! Hands down, best sandwich I have ever had AND it was vegetarian. Not easy finding favorable meals when you don't eat meat but this sandwich was ON POINT! Great job Danny!"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of The Bobbie. I would settle for the turkey sandwich, for sure. I personally did not think that the cranberry fit well with the rest of the sandwich. My favorite sandwich would be the Capastrami. It is so delicious to me and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"WOW what a disappointment. I got a Large drink and a \"bowl\" of soup. Drink was 2 and the bowl was SIX DOLLARS. Quite the rip off. (with tax an almost 9 dollar lunch.) the soup was smaller than most coffee cups. When I called to express my dismay the manager Ryanne(SP?) said listen \"honey\" that is just the size they are.

I promise we will NEVER dine here again."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in America for a reason. The bread is delicious and the ingredients are all fresh. They use great proportions and don't just slop sauce all over the sandwich. They make their own turkey in house and it's not like your normal deli shop, it's fantastic turkey. Can't wait to get back."}
{"text":"You guys rock ! The sandwiches are excellent the service was on point, thank you so much ! My guy loves the Bobbie , he said its the greatest sandwich ever! I do agree!! :)"}
{"text":"I've never had a better mushroom cheesesteak than at capriotti's, and I've been to philly. The bread is always fresh, the steak is always hot and peppered perfectly, the onions and mushrooms are cooked to perfection and the cheese is gooey and delish!!

Went to capriotti's Saturday night for two sandwiches, apparently they were really busy all day, but they had just enough bread for two. It was 745 pm and they were down to the last two buns, perfect! The lady had a bobbie, with extra cranberries and I had the regular mushroom cheesesteak with onions, which is my standard order. The sandwiches did not disappoint, never do.

This shop is voted \"best in vegas\" every year for a reason, I'm so glad they opened this location about a year and a half ago because its right around the corner from where I live and the next closest was at silv ranch and lv blvd which is about 10 mins away. I can walk to this one! 
5 star experience, just like always."}
{"text":"I gotta admit, the first time I came here I was not as impressed as the second time.

That was before I got the Grilled Italian, a game-changer of a sandwich.

It was a 50/50 shot I went to this place again instead of going to Firehouse Subs in the same plaza, which I knew would be good. Holy hell am I glad I went here instead!

The ten minutes I spent waiting for my sandwich didn't take too long because they had NBA on TNT playing on one of the TVs (I'm a huge fan of Sir Charles).

Those ten minutes were well worth the wait once the sandwich arrived. The sandwich had plenty of grilled onions and peppers which really helped. There were both sweet peppers and hot peppers with the Italian meats - AMAZING.

After this sandwich I can't even recall what I had the first time, but it was obviously inferior. If you love Italian sandwiches, this is the way to go!

I can't give it five stars because it's hard to give a place five stars. Especially when they play Katy Perry and other garbage over their speakers. Get real, Capriotti's."}
{"text":"Absolutely ridiculous. I ordered 40$ worth of food from this location to have delivered. It comes almost 2 hours later. The lady comes in drops it on my desk and walks out. I ordered a medium cheese steak and a small, plus some other side items. I opened my sandwiches and they gave me 2 veggie sandwiches . I call the store that delivered and I was told that they weren't the store that delivered . It must have been the one on Frank Lloyd Wright and the 101. That's ridiculous. I am less then a mile away from the Old Town location. The Old Town Capriottis manager was rude and no help at all. I called the other Capriottis and they apologized and said that they didn't take that order. But they will send out the food for us anyways. But guess what? They never showed up. I will not bring returning as a customer. This is unacceptable and the customer service is terrible . This place probably won't exist in 5 years at this rate."}
{"text":"I guess I'm stuck on the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich with onions, mushrooms and double cheese (a small upcharge for the extra cheese and mushrooms).  There is just no way I can avoid ordering a different sandwich!  I'm just too weak to pass up the most wonderful cheese steak sandwich served here!  Three different flavored iced teas are available and outer world chocolate chip cookies!  My choices might be boring but I seem to get high every time I eat here.  Check them out, you too can be hooked.  Not enough award stars available."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location since they opened a couple of years back. And before that i use to go to the one inside the casino. Its further from my home but the service was always worth it. That is until sunday (mothers day). Went in with my daughter and ordered at the counter. Was \"helped\" by bearded dude with tats on his arms. Shirt said Manager. Ive been a manager, been store manager anf let me tell you; if you hate your job quit. That simple. This guys could not have been worse at his job. Which consists of customer service. No smile, no hi nothi g stone cold i hate my job attitude. My teen daughter looked at me and said \"he made me feel uncomfortable ordering my own food\". I missed the other guy the older dude thats always smiling and being a good all around guy. Thats the kind of attitude you want. Not some guy that clearly hates his job. I will come here one more time. And if hes there 50/50 ill order. Or just take my business to the Craig location next to home depot or the other craig location next to city stop gas. Cuz ultimately no matter how good a sandwich is the service will ruin it  and bad customer service along with a shitty attitude will run people away."}
{"text":"I luv capriottis at other locations but the staff at this one is WEAK! They are slow and unorganized. The head girl who seems to be in charge most times I go doesnt keep things flowing well like the other locations around town. Take some pride in the art of sandwich making and customer service! Your customers are paying around $10 for a combo meal...You chose to work there, don't be miserable, gloomy, and lazy. I hope they step it up cuz I love the location"}
{"text":"Friendly counter people, delicious bread, fine deli cheese and lots of great veggie options.

Really nice service even though I always come in about half an hour before closing."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and problem solving. I ordered the wrong sandwich and They told me that it was no problem that they would make me the right sandwich and that I could keep the one I brought back. They also explained to me the difference between the veggie turkey sandwich and the veggie cole turkey sandwich in a very polite manner. I highly recommend this location forst for the food quality and second for the incredible customer service they provide."}
{"text":"Meh. I'm not sure if I just didn't get the right sub or....? It wasn't anywhere CLOSE to what I thought it would be. 

I got the thanksgiving sandwich (or whatever it's actually called). It was bland and dry...nothing to go nuts about by any means. Sigh ... And I had heard so many great things. Pretty disappointing actually. :-/"}
{"text":"I would suggest that the manager speak with her employees regarding the importance of business, as I called to place an order and the phone rang for two minutes and then disconnected.
I walked into the store to find that there was no one in the store; therefore, no reason that the phone should not have been answered.
During the time I was waiting for my order the phone continued to ring and it went unanswered.
I probably will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I love this Capriottis! I don't eat meat and normally don't like most fake meats but they have an awesome vegetarian cole turkey. I highly recommend it. Their employees are really laid back and they are always super giving with the ingredients they put in their sandwiches. Try this sandwich shop and you won't regret it, trust me!"}
{"text":"Just ordered a delivery today for lunch and I am really disappointed! I've ordered lunch a few times and it's always been quick and good. But today was a different story. 

Not only did it take an hour and fifteen minutes for a half sand which and cup of soup, bag of chips and a cookie. But my sandwich was not at all what I ordered. I ordered to add pepper relish, mustard vinegar and pickles. I tasted zero vinegar and everything is was almost non existent along with the veggies that already come onThe whole sandwich looked thrown together and kind of smooshed. And it being down the street, not sure why it took over an hour for something so simple...

Don't usually ever write reviews but I'm truly disappointed. Won't be ordering lunch from them for awhile."}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches! kinda high priced"}
{"text":"Good God, the Capastrami was the best damn sandwich I have had in recent memory. The Bobbie was nothing to scoff at either. If you love sandwiches then you CANNOT pass on this spot."}
{"text":"When Im in vegas I have to have a Capriotti's sandwich, they have so many signature sands I love this place.. Try the capastrami or the bobby . you cant loose they are delicious.. Reminds me of NY deli.. Really high quality with a twist.. this is a must visit.. its amazing and the prices are reasonable. the large is too much for anyone 2 can feed 4 people .. Highly recommend!!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of Las Vegas staples. Always consistent. You know what you're getting. Today it's a capistrami. Slaw be jo pretty good too."}
{"text":"We always have the worst experience here!!! We just left today because we ordered one sandwich and waited 30 minutes, when my husband asked why everyone was getting their sandwiches that had ordered after us, their response was, \"THAT's JUST THE WAY IT IS!\" Totally unsatisfactory! There's always a long wait time regardless of how many people, and obviously not caring about the order of people ordering or them waiting."}
{"text":"Bought a large cheese steak worst mistake I've ever made.  I thought this was a sandwich shop? Boring, bland hardly any seasoning of the thin sliced beef. Food was hot but it's not worth the money in my opinion.   So much for a $5 tip being incentive to make it half way decent.  Instead I'm leaving pissed off & wasted my cheat day & money.

Those sweet peppers turned my stomach very bitter, not sweet at all.  The cheese didn't compliment the Philly at all. That's your \"provolone\"? Come on.  This is supposedly the best Cap in the city. Spent $32 on food to  Never return again. I'm not kidding I have the receipt to prove it."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich is the chicken philly with onions sweet peppers with ketchup and mayo mmmm soooo yummyyy"}
{"text":"If you have 45 minutes for them to give your order to someone else and then get upset because you expect a sandwich and a refund then this is definitely your place. The food is good but you have to consider if the hassle is worth it"}
{"text":"Our order was so slow.  We waited 20-25 minutes for two sandwich.  And then they didn't even make them correctly.  Absolutely no dressing on them.  When we asked for some oil and vinegar dressing to put on it, we were given straight olive oil.  No spices or vinegar at all.   It was actually the worst sandwich ever.  And it is sad as they are one of my favorite sandwich locations elsewhere."}
{"text":"I see a lot of bad reviews, but I personally have never had a problem with this location. I always call ahead to avoid waiting. Occasionally the person taking the order sounds annoyed when you call, but I've experienced this at other places as well, so it doesn't stop me from ordering from here."}
{"text":"Horrible. Ordered a medium grilled Italian, cashier Gianna charges me for a large. She then questions me and says \"Oh you ordered a medium\"  then proceeds to walk away from me and says something to a coworker. Not once was there an apology or anything. Made me feel as though It was my fault that I had to correct her. Really......"}
{"text":"Capriotti's Sandwich Shop has always and will always be the legend of the best sandwiches! I have been coming here for over a decade now dating back to when my family decided to move out to Las Vegas. This location was on my radar being that I was on a stay-cation across the street at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino. 

One night my friends and I were hungry after so major gambling and drinking so we decided to eat something outside of the choices that the hotel had to offer for us. Of course I was left with the duty to find us all something to eat so what did I do? You got it.. pulled my phone out and used my most trusted resource.. YELP!

When we arrived on a late Saturday night to our surprise there really wasn't much of a wait! Score! My taste buds were pushing towards an old fashion Philly Cheesteak so I went exactly with that. Everything on it you know grilled onions, peppers, mayo the usual. I knew I wasn't going to be able to finish the monster size 14inch sub so I took it a notch down to the 12inch. One thing I've always appreciated was the decent pricing that they offer on all of the sandwiches! While waiting on my sandwich I held a convo with the cashier who was super friendly and really provided great customer service. 

Listen, when you couple great customer service along with great food.. that's a 5-star type of visit! Subway what?! Nah it's all about Capriotti's Sandwich Shop!"}
{"text":"I tried to call in my order and a woman put me on hold. I was on hold for 10 minutes listening to classical music all the way here. I want to post the screenshot of the call history on my post. I walked in and there was no line and the phone was at the other cashier station. He didn't know I was on hold and picked it up and it was me. He was nice and apologized and even gave a 10% discount for the trouble. On my way out I noticed there was a woman cashier at the station where the phone was. The good cashier's name was Joshua that had great customer service, keep him and give him a raise for keeping the customer, get rid of the woman cashier who doesn't have customer service skills and put me on hold for 10 minutes. 1 star this time."}
{"text":"Like most things in life, bigger is better... so for my first sandwich just to try this place out to see if I liked it... I got 20 inches of beauty and delicious messiness. Worth every stain on my shirt, pants and break room table that I may or may not have had time to clean. It's a good thing none of my co workers read my reviews........... TODD!!.

I ordered delivery on this place so I actually don't even know what it looks like but I do know that I will be stopping in to try other things. I will probably only buy the 20 inch sandwiches because I'm smart-"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Phoenix from Reno, NV. Let me first say: there is a Capriotti's in Reno and I never once went there. All I'd ever heard was that it was a meat-heavy sandwich shop, and I'm a vegetarian, so I figured I may as well stick with the chains I knew had veggie sandwiches on the menu--Jimmy Johns, Port of Subs, etc. I should have know better.

Today, the boyfriend got a hankering for a sandwich, and as I'm unemployed, I've been able to meet him for lunch the last few days. This time, he suggested Capriotti's. I checked the menu online, and it said there was a cheese sandwich, which was just fine with me, so I agreed to meet him there.

I was in line, all set to ask for a cheese sandwich with all the fixin's when, lo and behold, I saw a vegetarian sandwich section. I was not expecting this: most places just have one vegetarian, cheese sandwich option. Don't get me wrong, I love a good cheese sandwich--they end up just being all vegetables with a good smattering of mayo and avocado. But here, I had options! There were 4 specific vegetarian sandwiches, including a veggie cheesesteak. 

I could not bring myself to eat cheesesteak on a 104 degree day (although my boyfriend had no problem), so I got the Veggie Cole Turkey. I was so pleased they had this, because I was looking at the Cole Turkey sandwich originally and lamenting that I couldn't also have coleslaw on my sandwich. BUT I COULD. 

Here's what always gets me with vegetarian fake meats: with the good ones, I'm instantly afraid there's been an accident and I've been given real meat and my stomach will be in turmoil for the next 48 hours. I took 3 bites of my sandwich and then made my boyfriend eat some of the fake turkey, because I was positive it was not fake. I looked at the receipt and at the wrapper: both said veggie. I still felt the slightest bit guilty because I was enjoying the fake meat so very much.

All in all, I have to give Capriotti's much more credit than I ever have in the past for having viable and delicious vegetarian options. My only issue was that I didn't get enough vegetables, which was mostly my fault for assuming there would be any on the sandwich in the first place. Next time, I'll be asking to add some lettuce to soak up the mayo and Russian dressing.

Vegetarians, have no fear of Capriotti's; you have some options!"}
{"text":"The service here was great and the workers were very friendly and helpful. I split the medium Bobbie and medium capastrami with my friend, Pamela S. whose review is right below. They were very yummy and satisfying, needless to say it was a lot of food and I practically had a footlong leftover. The leftovers were great when I needed a drunken snack."}
{"text":"The cheesesteaks  , meatballs and hoagies are all great. The turkey is also outstanding. They tend to make mistakes on sandwiches so check your order before you take it home."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich!! Super fresh cold veggies and the roasted turkey was yummy! Had the bowl
Of minestrone soup... Perfect!!"}
{"text":"GOOOOOOOD EATS!!!
This place is the best Sandwich shop in Las Vegas.  I have made the trek to Capriottis from Rehab (Hard Rock Hotel) in the 118 degree heat just to get my favorite \"Cole Turkey\" sandwich.  Everyone I take here agrees that it Good Eats.  Do not try to alter the menu items they are specific for a reason.  Decor is non existent.  The soda cup is of ample size.
Insider tip:  Order a Large and share it with a friend.  Big bag of chips is the better option.

Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"I thought I was in Jimmy johns for a second because I didn't even pay yet and my sandwich was ready! I had this coupon promoting a free 9\" sub with any purchase so I bought a cookie. I ate all of my Veggie turkey sandwich and that was more than delicious. Also once you do check in on yelp they offer a free complimentary dessert of either a choice between a brownie or a cookie."}
{"text":"The view while eating a 12\" veggie turkey was towards the AMC theatre entrance and watching the children's train go in circles throughout the square. I definitely grubbed hard and people watched from the 2nd floor. It didn't take long to receive my order which was under 8 minutes. I guess the hungrier you look while ordering and shaking the faster they make your food, life hacks!"}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop in Las Vegas!! I recommend the \"Bobbie\" sandwich which is like having Thanksgiving dinner all year long...and the Cap-pastrami sandwich...make sure to get that one with extra cheese and eat it while it's hot!!"}
{"text":"Service is great and the food is great. When I walked in, there were 3 women that greeted me with a big smile. I originally went in to joes pizza and walked out because they were rude. So glad I went to capriottis instead!"}
{"text":"Came in later in the evening. The location is surprisingly clean to be so close to the strip.  The cashier was vey attentive and quick to help.  Which is very refreshing for such a popular sandwich spot! If you love a good sandwich and service come here.  And remember to tip!! \"BEER MONEY!!\""}
{"text":"This is a solid Capriotti's! The sandwiches are always fresh and consistent in quality! The customer service is great and best of all there is a yelp offer! Whoootwhoot!! 

I always order the capastrami only because I'm too addicted to it try the Bobbie again. The bread oh lawd the bread... to start is always warm and chewy! It holds up to the meat, sauce, and slaw perfectly! The meat is always tender, the coleslaw is always creamy and crunchy so you know it's fresh! With that description you really can't beat this sandwich! A small is a foot long compared to anywhere else if you ask me and a large sandwich here can feed an army! 

Make sure before you order you have your caps app ready because I was surprised to get a bogo sub on my last order and in addition to that yelp offered a free drink with checkin!"}
{"text":"Rude service, lady thought I was someone else and told made me put the chips I paid for back like I was trying to steal some chips, then when she noticed I was I wasn't the order she thought I was she apologized and tried to be nice after she tried to embarrass me in front of the people by the counter, they need to hire a couple more people that have better customer service because her and the guy at the register were rude."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. The menu is pretty straight forward  with sandwiches from 6 - 12 inches. Hot or cold.

I decided on the hot Italian and was leaning towards the six inch, but for a few bucks more you could get the eight inch. And what guy on the planet wouldn't pay 2 bucks for an extra 2 inches amiright?

It only took a few minutes and the sandwich was great! I ate the first half and probably should've stopped, but it was so good I crammed in the other half shortly after. After I waddled out of the shop in a self induced, binge-worthy sandwich bliss I wrote this review.

I will definitely be back, hopefully next time with more self control, or possibly a larger pant size..."}
{"text":"Hate to do this to this place but as I write this review, I am very frustrated with this particular location!  This is the second time in a row that I ordered a sandwich to go and got home to find out the order was wrong!  I specifically asked for \"no tomatoes and all the extras with peppers, etc\" .  Both times I got home to find a sandwich with tomatoes and none of the extras!  So frustrating!  Food is good but check your orders as they have been really messing up here lately!"}
{"text":"I've seen this sandwich place driving around and I was super excited to try them. The guy that took my order was super nice and made great suggestions. I decided on the half Bbq chicken salad and half Philly cheesesteak sandwich.
I sat down text my friend, played some games and waited and waited. The friendly guy began taking a huge catering order out and disappeared.  I checked the time from when I sent my first text and it had been 30 minutes! I seriously waited over 30 minutes for my food. I heard them in the back ask if it ever got made. When they finally called my name the guy wasn't even friendly and didn't acknowledge my wait. I wasn't offered a bag of chips or free soda. Nothing! 

The Philly was just ok. The meat was good, it wasn't fatty or anything. The salad was amazing! I was too hungry after the wait to take pictures. The BBQ sauce was perfect and I loved the corn and black beans. The crispy onion was my favorite. Added the perfect crunch. 

Overall they would've gotten 4 stars had it not been for the service. I'll go back and get the salad again, a half wasn't enough!"}
{"text":"This really isn't just another sandwich shop.  With so many sub shops out there its really hard to give four and five star reviews but I would have to give this place a solid four and a half.  The Capastrami sandwich is my favorite, next would be the Bobbie.  

If you're in the mood for a sub, this place gets high marks.  Obviously, any restaurant that gets noticed on the food network is probably going to be a decent meal but I put this place in my top five favorite sandwich shops in the Phoenix area.  Sure the sandwich is a bit more expensive but you'll taste the difference when you take the first bite."}
{"text":"I have to say, this was my first time at Capriotti's and it was fantastic! The service was absolutely incredible. They were fast and helpful and the atmosphere is just great. The people working here were so nice and I'm surprised the reviews aren't very favorable. Just come here for yourself and try it out. By the way, the small sandwich is a 9\" sub, so just know you'll have leftovers!"}
{"text":"I love the Capastrami and the prices are really reasonable, but this particular location is terrible. I highly recommend going to a different branch, I have been 3 times, the first time was a okay/good experience, the second time it took 5 girls 20 min to make us a sandwich and a salad (we were the only people there waiting for food) and they gave is attitude for being frustrated and to top if off it smelled like cigarettes, It was like we were in the smoking section of a casino. And the third time It took them 30 min for our order (granted it was busy) but the girls there have a terrible attitude and work like sloth's, seriously though and when it was all said and done the messed up our order. I personally won't go there ever again"}
{"text":"I came super late probably around eleven and was surprised it was open! There was only one guy working but he was pretty quick! Honestly this was the best bobby that I've ever had! I didn't realize the capriottis that yelp was bringing me to was inside of a casino until last minute but I decided to just go for it and I'm really glad I did! Very happy!"}
{"text":"Great food as always the booby is our favorite sandwich.  Everything was fresh and there service was great.  It was busy and we still got served fairly quick"}
{"text":"Terrible the worst I ever had hardly any meat called the store and the manager had the nerve to say the bread was bigger then usual wth u know that dumb ass put more meat lvb is the best! Check out my pic!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Capriotti's. 5 stars for service and food!! The people working there were very friendly! 

BF ordered the Capastrami and I ordered the Cran-Slam Club. Man, I bit into my sandwich and it was delicioius.. cold cut turkey/ham with cranberry sauce. I loved it from first bite!

But my first bite into the Capastrami was heaven. I broke up with Cran-Slam Club and I  began my new love affairwith Capastrami. Warm pastrami with tangy coleslaw.. Sigh. I will never forget you Capastrami!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped in at the strip mall just off the strip. I tried the capastrami, pastrami with swiss cheese,  cole slaw and russian dressing. It was great, all the ingredients tasted great and the bread was so fresh and tasty.  My Dad kept talking about his sandwhich (same thing) for the next couple of days."}
{"text":"What a great, great find thanks to my cousin! Totally non-descript and unassuming (some may call it hole-in-the-wall), but don't let the place fool you! Their sandwiches are delicious!! While my fancy sisters were at Holstein's in the Cosmopolitan eating a $20+ burger, I was feeding my family of 5 for less than $30 at Capriotti's, and I'm sure it was just as delicious!

My hubby and I split the capastrami and the slawbejo. The capastrami consisted of hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and cole slaw. The slawbejo contained homemade roast beef, provolone, russian dressing and cole slaw. The slaw is out-of-this-world tasty, and is a perfect complement to the hot pastrami and roast beef, respectively. My kids had the grilled cheese sandwich. It's not on the menu, but the server was friendly and accomodating, and grilled it for them. I am extremely impressed by the taste of the food at this joint!! Don't let the looks of this place deceive you. Come here and you will definitely enjoy your food!"}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite sandwich shop. Every time I go there and get the stuffing and cranberry sauce sandwich. It literally cannot be beat. Friendly folks work at this place and the food is great. You cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"Love their Bobby sandwich! Have to stop here everytime we visit. So yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm an only child from a single parent who (wisely) was only close to her multitude of siblings on holidays. My grandmother was quite the matriarch.. a chain-smoking, bulbous, overbearing woman. She did, however, hold enough power over my mother to collect us each Thanksgiving along with the rest of her children and their children. My mother and I would typically arrive in a in some sort of standard commuting vehicle, namely a car. The others, I imagine, disembarked from a very short bus and held hands in a single-file line until they were safely in the house. 

The next four hours leading up the the main event was a melee of inter sibling rivalry, backhanded compliments, and empty inquiries. 

All that said, I always looked forward to this annual charade. As much as my grandmother failed at raising her offspring into well-adjusted, society-contributing adults, she oppositely triumphed at preparing, baking, braising, stuffing, carving, and serving the most delicious turkey and sides one could ever ask for. For this alone I love and miss the woman. 

Which brings me to my review of Capriotti's \"The Bobbie\" sandwich...

This Capriotti fella must be some sort of necromancer black magician because he has reincarnated my grandmother and put her to work in his kitchen. How else could he have duplicated her perfectly seasoned and juicy turkey? And her stuffing that is the delicate amount of moist so that it sticks together without being soggy? He did all this while remaining creative enough to throw all this goodness on a sub with mayo and fresh cran sauce to create the single greatest sandwich on earth.  

Mr. Capriotti I thank you for making nostalgia available on demand anytime I want it for under ten bucks."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches but horrible service.  Staff of young boys are rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and ordered a ham & cheese sub. There was a line of people so it took them about 20 mins to make the sub. The employees were friendly and seemed to be working hard getting all the orders out without too much delay. 

As for the sub - it was meh! The ingredients seemed fresh enough but the bread was far from the best bread I have had on a sub. Maybe people like it because it is really sweet but I would rather have bread that tastes like bread! Maybe the cooked sandwiches are better but I wouldn't order another cold one."}
{"text":"So many times we pulled up at 7:30 quarter to 8 and they are closed giving us dagger as for looks because we want to order a sandwich it says it's closed at 8 not 7:30 not 7:40 not 7:45 8 which is a stupid time for it to be closing anyway so blonde you with the ponytail a few every time you give me nasty gargoyle face"}
{"text":"Best pastrami sandwich ever! The bread was soft and tasty with no fat on the meat! Delicious over all and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"One word...capastrami!  The best sandwich in all of the valley.  Never ever go anywhere else.  They are all over the valley.  Go!"}
{"text":"Rex is a tough guy...a real man's man...better...he is a real Rex's man. Most men know they can never be Rex...and all women know they will never be with anyone as good as Rex. It is a burden. It is a curse. Rex bears the mantle for what all men should be. Tough. Strong. Virile. Always has a rag, some gas and three pills found in Gary Busey's house.  Still, there is another side. A sensitive side. A side that has a heart.  Rex weeps when he sees pictures of fat girls who was one thin. Rex sobs uncontrollably when he sees a puppy...eating out of a dumpster...and there is none for Rex.  Rex wails and throws himself to the ground at the mere thought of Jessica Alba's sweet babies...how they have ruined her once beautiful vagina.  He is human. Rex IS human...no matter what the Slovakian courts may say.

Today...this day...January 45, 2193...Rex weeps again.  Sadness has washed over Rex...much like the time he found out that his girlfriend wasn't just smelly...she had died 38 days earlier. Damn you paint thinner and Pine Sol...why do you have to be so much fun with such an evil side.  Granted Rex is not as upset as when Judy... Jenny...Jana...whatever her name was expired...this time Rex doesn't have to throw out his couch. Still Rex is upset.  Why do you ask?  DON'T EVER ASK ME A QUESTION AGAIN YOU PATHETIC FREAK!!!  Rex will tell you at his own time...okay...Rex is upset because another love of his...is dead.  Capriotti's Sandwich Shop is dead to me.  Rex has actually eaten Capriotti's years ago back east. Rex decided to leave where he was staying...by hiding under a laundry truck and going through two gates, swam through a river, wrestled a rat the size of a large dog and survived in Wilmington...which was the hardest part.  During his brief, but highly publicized change of address he ate at a Capriottti's. It was excellent. Perfect sub. Inventive. Quality ingredients. Care. Pride. It was a taste sensation. A revelation.
 
That was a long time. A long, long time ago. Now...now Capriotti's is basically Subway but a few notches better...but not nearly as good as it should be. Especially considering the price differential between the two. Such a shame. Total shame.  It would be easy to change their ways, but the chain is now owned by a corporation so the traditional corporation changes are taking place.  Less meat. Lower quality ingredients. Substantially less overall care and dedication to the craft which is sandwich making.
 
Rex went and bought 2 subs for the first time in about 9 months.  Rex bought the Cole Turkey and the Bobbie.  The Cole Turkey Rex hadn't bought in 3 or 4 years.  The turkey was dry. There wasn't enough of it. There wasn't enough sauce. It was a total mess. Lots of cole slaw because it is cheap.  The Bobbie...my beloved Bobbie has been absolutely destroyed. Heavy on the stuffing light on the turkey, too much mayo and not enough cranberry sauce.  Rex is a good man...a great man...a fair man...a well hung man...and he tried the best sub. The Capastrami. That is when things went wrong. Rex stood up and attempted to defecate out the horrible food. Rex screamed...\"I AM GOING TO CRAP THIS CRAP OUT OF MY CRAPPER!\"  Everyone else screamed...melee ensued...Rex was escorted out...for those who are interested...mission accomplished.

This location is no better or worse than all of the location. It isn't an individual store issue it is a systemic issue because of the change in ownership.  Rex wants to love Capriotti's. It is what the world needs...a great chain that makes incredible subs/sandwiches with care and quality. There just isn't one out there.  Firehouse comes close (review to come later) but there isn't a perfect one.
  
Now the expended menu with salads, etc will only water down the brand and quality further. They could have spent more money to buy meat in bulk at a lower cost so they could more on their sandwiches, like they used to have. No. They use their purchasing power to buy lettuce. Really? That is corporate thinking...bad thinking.
 
Rex will always be what you want him to be. Incorrigible. You will always be what Rex wants you to be. Gullible."}
{"text":"A really great sandwich shop hidden in the smallest plaza!  

I ordered the capistrami.  Normally, I order my pastrami very plain, only with the meat, lettuce, and mayo, but this time, I had it as is, meat, coleslaw, Swiss cheese, and dressing.  Completely made it worth it!,  the pastrami has excellent flavor in itself.  The coleslaw was not too overpowering, and the sauce tied everything together nicely.  

It is slightly pricey as far as sandwiches go, but their sandwiches are huge!

Definitely visit this place!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place a 0!!!! First off waited about half hour for my 1 sandwich.2nd I bought my sandwich took it home eat few bites then BAM here a loud crunch in my mouth .... spit out my food and and dug around in it to find glass peices and few min later my husband eating the other half of the sandwich had a crunch too ! Spit his food out I called n that acted like I was a liar and they said they have no glass around there grill but that doesn't explain why the glass was in my food ! I will never eat here again shame shame and they said where is your receipt n the girl clearly checked me out not even hour earlier n she said next time I need the receipt r u kidding me ? There won't be a next time ..... I never ever ever write reviews but I am livid"}
{"text":"I go to Capriotti's a lot. I went on Monday January 1, 2018 and they opened at 11:00 a.m. I stood there until 11:05 a.m. waiting for the lady to say something. She saw me standing there and did not say can I help you or we will be right with you. I understand that you just opened but if you want business then open your mouth because the movies started that day at 10:00 a.m. This is not the first time my experience has not been good there so I think I will not go back. I did get my Capriotti's off the new location on Oso Blanca road."}
{"text":"I will not be going back to this Capriotti's Shop!! 
First, I made a credit card purchase and one of their employees used my card and charged $140.00. The owner called me and told me how did I know it was his store and I told him that I had not used my card before then or after then. He told me that someone could have written my number down months ago and used it the same day that I came into his store. He then told me why was I upset since I did not make the charges the bank was going to credit my money. I told him it was the principle and then he called me \"sweetheart\" and I told him not to call me that. Then he said what did I want him to do? I told him nothing. I wanted him to know and now that he knew and since he got nasty he could do absolutely nothing and I told him to have a nice day and I hung up. 
I do not know why people think you are always out to get something. Maybe owners need to understand that if their employees take peoples credit card numbers and charge $140.00 worth of merchandise on someone else maybe they need to call you with sincerity in their voice versus attitude and disgust. Instead of acting like it could not have happened or it was your fault for purchasing with your debit card maybe an apology would have been better. But let me be clear I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK TO THIS CAPRIOTTI'S BECAUSE OF THE OWNER!!!!"}
{"text":"If we could give a zero rating, we would.  My son called in a sandwich order 15 minutes before he arrived to the restaurant so it would be ready when he got there.  It was a special order (no cheese or onions), and he said to me, \"Watch, they'll screw it up.  Any time I call and take something off of a sandwich, or add something, it's like their minds get all discombobulated and they screw is up.\". After waiting there for 15 minutes, he got his sandwich.  He opened it up to start eating and BAM, there were cheese and onions on it!  He wrapped it back up, took it to the counter, told them, and said he wants everything that comes on it EXCEPT cheese and onions.  While the girl is making it, she calls out across the restaurant \"Did you want the xfgdcdfgc on it (I don't remember what the ingredients were)?\"  \"Yes.\" Then he looks at me and says, \"What is so hard about making a sandwich with EVERYTHING but cheese and onions?!\" \"And it takes what, 30 minutes to make it wrong and another 10 to make the second one.  So much for an hour lunch.  And these people want to be paid $15 an hour?\". 

The ONLY reason he even tried this location again was because he was coming to this side of town to see me on lunch break.  He won't be back.  I stopped going a long time ago because service is ridiculously slow.....there's no excuse for it....it's not like they were popping at the seem with business.  Disgraceful."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops i've ever been too.....i visited this place in 07 when i was in Vegas for a BBall tournament and my friend took me here to eat after our tournament. He recommended i order the Bobbie sandwich and i was not disappointed in the least!!!! It's so good that before my friend and I drove back to California we had to make a stop at Capriotti's inside of Red Rock Casino and order a Bobbie for the road!!!!"}
{"text":"The Bobbie sandwich is worth the hype. If you like Thanksgiving (which you should cause you're a patriot reading this) then you'll dig this sandwich. They made the sandwich in, no bs, 1 minute or less. I had just gotten my drink filed and it was ready. The manager was working the register and he was very courteous and professional. If you have a chance to get one of these wiches, GET IT!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am usually the one to only read reviews, I don't normally post them but I was really upset about the poor quality that this particular store gave me and feel it gives an awesome chain a really bad name. My family has been going to Capriottis for years and we have NEVER had such a bad experience.  When we walked in there was a nice girl at the front that greeted us - that was the only positive thing and the rest went downhill from there. There were maybe 3 other couples there waiting for food. We placed our order of 1 small cheesesteak and 1 large homemade turkey.  We waited for about 15 minutes (which was longer than it took us to vote) and were finally given our bag of sandwiches.  As we were walking out I noticed it didn't seem the same as our usual. What I found inside the bag was 1 small cheesesteak and 2 smaller turkey sandwiches.  I walked back in and was greeted by another employee, and I explained that my order didn't seem right. A small sandwich is 9\".  How do two small sandwiches (which were actually smaller than a 9\"small sandwich) equal 20\"?  He just looked at me like I was crazy. I then asked for a manager , but only a supervisor was available. She really could have cared less about why I was disappointed.  She repeated herself telling me that we still received the same amount of meat and cheese and that they had run out of bread.  There is no way there was the same amount. She said that I could wait for more bread but again it will have the same amount of bread and cheese.  I really didn't want to wait any longer, so we left.  When we got home it was worse than I thought. The steak sandwich had hardly any meat on it and it was burned and crunchy.  The turkey sandwich was almost as bare, and they decided to grill our side order of peppers???  The bread tasted old and sandwich was dry.  I should have went with my gut and got a refund while I was there.  No more DTS Capriottis EVER!"}
{"text":"Sandwich is good as always. But, the death metal music blasting on full volume over the Intercom is horrible. Can't even hear my friends sitting across the table. Terrible."}
{"text":"The pastrami sandwich is pretty good. The sandwich was giant and 2 of us ate it for 2 meals. However... I'm a puritan at heart about pastrami and I feel I've been short-changed by not having it on rye. Plus... the sandwich isn't toasted which is the way I like a sub roll if need be.

People have raved about the turkey gobbler... I found it boring. Shredded turkey, canned cranberry sauce and mayo on a sub roll. Eh...?

The staff at the Henderson store is maddeningly disorganized. But even with all the faults, I do come back occasionally.

Some would argue this is the best sandwich shop in Las Vegas... well,.. I don't agree. I'm still searching."}
{"text":"Came at 11am on a weekday to inquire about ordering a small sandwich catering platter for the moving crew that was packing up my house that day. Normally they'd need a little more advance notice, especially if pick up time was during peak time, but since I came early before the lunch rush, they were happy to take my order. I simply placed an order for a cold sandwich platter (Italian, roast beef and turkey) and instead of hovering/waiting, I told them I'd run to nearby Walmart to pick up drinks, chips and dessert and return. I returned 15 minutes later and the platter was ready. The sandwich platter was boxed up nicely and they offered condiments of mayo and mustard packets, and it was easy to transport back to my home. Our moving guys were really appreciative that I didn't just hand them a pizza, but actually got them some pretty tasty sandwiches. They raved about how great everything tasted! Next time we go back, I'd love to try some of the hot sandwiches like the Bobbie."}
{"text":"Delicious! Huge portions. Good value. Fantastic service. Weird location. If you try the Bobbie, get it warm. Download the app and fill out the receipt survey for even more savings."}
{"text":"The Capistrami sandwich here is absolutely delicious and worthy of a 5 star review.  Pastrami, coleslaw, Russian dressing, provolone cheese, and you can request grilled peppers to add a little kick.  For you LA folk, think the Oinkster pastrami multiplied times 10.  Great little spot and worthy of multiple repeat performances.  Thanks for the recommendation Dean and Sherri!"}
{"text":"The epitome of average OK food.

Everything seems fresh and they're professional here; the ingredients are apparently mostly house-prepared. 

But I've tried 5 sandwiches from three locations and they're all bland. The bread is enormous and frankly it's awful. Cheese tastes too processed. Roast beef, meatballs, all of their prepared meats, are basically just thrown into an oven without spices and then served. 

Prices on the high side but I'll give them credit for serving a genuinely large and fresh sandwich. Worth a pick-up in a hurry but this is utilitarian food, not gourmet sandwiches."}
{"text":"I was given a sandwich that had been premade and placed in the refigerator. It was terrible and the girl working was extremely unpleasant and had a scowl on her face the whole time we were there. I had high hopes for this place and was very disappointed."}
{"text":"I like good food.  But if the food is so good I still remember it, then it earns its five stars.

So what do newlyweds do when they're on a road trip from the San Francisco area to the Grand Canyon, North Rim, and they're hungry?  Well, you can hit a buffet on Fremont Street or the Strip.  (We did that on the return trip.)  Or you can go to Capriotti's.  Okay, Las Vegas has other choices too.  But Capriotti's worked great for us.

Sandwiches are hard on my hunny.  She has Crohn's Disease, so her intestines cannot process most of the things that make sandwiches taste great.  She explained that to them, and they were very accommodating to her.  We ended up getting a large sandwich, half for me and half for her, and they didn't give us grief about it.  We didn't eat there;  we took it with us as we drove to Arizona, and it lasted us for two meals.  I'm a big eater, so that's saying a lot.

And guess what?  After that buffet on the return trip, we stopped by here again on the way back to California for another big sandwich.

Locals and transplants probably already know about this place, so for all you weekenders that clog I-15 on Friday nights and Sunday afternoons - you know who you are - you MUST eat here.  It's easy to miss, it's hidden away in a shopping center between I-15 and the strip.  But you'll certainly get more for your money than at the casinos.  Hey, it may end up being the most memorable part of your trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"mmmmm yummy sandwiches here.  I decided to stop by because I was starving and there was nothing else around.  This was my first time here so I decided to play it safe and order the grilled italian (small).  It was soooo delicious.  The salami was a little on the spicy side for me, but it tasted very good.  I ordered the small one and was only able to eat 1/2 of it.  I grabbed a menu on the way out and plan on being back to try the other flavors.

Price wise it was not bad the for the portion size."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come for subs.  Best steak and cheese in vegas!  The staff is always friendly, the order is alwats correct.  The only thing I would say is that their mobile app could be better.  But that is my only complaint.  My wife and I order from here a couple times every month."}
{"text":"Service was great and super friendly. Unfortunately food wasn't so great and the bread was really stale. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Very glad I took a chance going in. Got the \"Bobbie\" and it was great. The \"Bobbie\" is pretty much Thanksgiving on a sub bun and I have no problems with that. Will have to try it again before vacation is over."}
{"text":"Even though I paid for a 12\" I got a 9\" which was maxing and that made up for my 4 extra inches lol. Super good, good customer service, and they are quick... there was only one staff and she was awsomee"}
{"text":"We discovered Capriotti's when we were looking for a vegetarian-friendly place to have lunch before a game at Scottsdale Stadium. What a great find! I hope we can someday hope to have a Capriotti's near our home in Santa Cruz, CA!

It's rare (read \"virtually unheard of\") to find a sandwich shop that does much more for vegetarians than a basic veggies and cheese sandwich, so we were astounded to have the additional options of veggie turkey with cheese, veggie turkey cole, and a veggie chicken cheese steak! The Capriotti's here uses veggie turkey made by Worthington's/Loma Linda, which any long-term vegetarian can tell you makes the best meat analogs in the business (in fact, my husband and I special order Worthington's canned chili by the case...it's just that good).

I had the veggie turkey cole, and it was really good...lots of yummy veggie turkey piled on a fresh sub roll (They have really good bread! Much better than Subway!) with provolone, cole slaw, and Russian dressing. My husband had the cheese steak, and was very pleased with his as well, though he did say that next time he would ask for it with more mayo.

I'm definitely a fan, and will definitely look out for Capriotti's when we travel!"}
{"text":"This chain has gone down hill.. You taste more bread than you do what's supposed to be between it. I guess because economy is so bad that's why they hold back what they put on, and IN the sandwich. The service sucks.. The place is dirty. I think they wipe down the tables with a dirty rag b/c they were sticky."}
{"text":"Diasppointed! They only have 20 Oz soft drinks and bottled water to drink. They provided me with a small Dixie cup for water that I would have to get out of the restroom."}
{"text":"I have had capriotti's a few times however this time the man behind the counter just rubbed me the wrong way.  I was ordering to go and my friend has a specific order which the man who was taking my order was confused by.  We were ordering a turkey sub just not the way they make their traditional turkey. I didn't think it was too hard of a concept but he seemed to have thought so.  For it only being me in there I would expect better service.  I will steer clear of this location the next time I'm craving Capriotti's!"}
{"text":"If you have time to waste, then be my guest. Slowest service for a sandwich shop that I have experienced in a while. Too bad, looked like good food."}
{"text":"After waiting over 25 min for two sandwiches, I walked out.  I've been coming here for a couple years but I think I've finally had enough. I doubt I'll return.  The food isn't great, isn't horrible but it's close to home.  The staff isn't very swift and gets my order wrong as often as right. I've had enough and will go somewhere else. As for the Bobby sandwich that I've heard so much about.... It's bad. Gummy stuffing, bland turkey and bad cranberry sauce. Only someone who's never had a good turkey dinner would think it in any way resembles Thanksgiving dinner."}
{"text":"Capriottis is famous for \"The Bobbie\" which is basically thanksgiving in a sandwich. However, their cheese steak is a better choice. I Ordered it with jalapenos and mushrooms, my mouth is watering thinking about it."}
{"text":"They fry the onions in something spicy and don't tell ya...for a 10 buck sandwich all you get is meat and cheese...no lettuce or no nothing.... I can get a better sandwich at Subway for much less in price....The cashiers/worker seemed depressed and a very limited menu board"}
{"text":"If it's 11am ( when they open ) \"good luck\" trying to call!!  Tried to call several times and....ring ring ring...ECT. ( ya might as well get rid of your phone because it either doesn't work or you don't wanna answer )  Also, tried to do the on-line thing and boom...ya need a flipping credit card!! WTF??!!  I guess CASH doesn't seem to work any more. Even tho cash was invented wayyy before stupid credit cards!! Just another way to screw people over. It's not like I'm not coming down to get the sandwiches. Whatever...."}
{"text":"I just ate a lettuce and tomato sandwich. Gone are the days where Capriotti's gives you a decent sandwich. They used to have the best turkey sandwiches but you can barely taste the turkey  because the portion is so small. And I have tried several other locations to see if it was just this one....not!  They are now no different than Subway!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's has the best turkey sandwich I have ever eaten. I always get turkey and swiss with the works and it is always delicious....just like thanksgiving turkey!!! Also at this location they serve THE BEST french fries. I really wish the other Capriotti's would follow suit and sell them too! This review is making me hungry. I think I am going to out now and get a turkey sandwich right now LOL!!! Try it you will not be disappointed. Oh I must also add the employees at all the Capriotti's I have been to are always very nice especially at the green valley ranch location."}
{"text":"Ordered two cheesesteaks to go. It took 15/20 minutes to get the food... then got home and opened up two CHICKEN cheesesteaks. Wouldn't be so pissed except these taste horrible and are dry. What a waste of time and money. Will never come here again!"}
{"text":"Decent sandwiches, and a great price for the area. In kind of a run down strip mall though."}
{"text":"Have gone to this location several times and always a problem, either wrong size sandwitch, wrong type, attempted buying a gift card and clerk did not know had to do it,  last trip called order in went to pick it up and was told change of shift and outgoing shift never put order in, so had no order to pick up. Told me I could wait 15 min.  I will not go back again."}
{"text":"I have been to a Capriotti's in Maryland previously and had much higher expectations than today's reality. We had a build-your-own turkey sandwich that was just flat on flavor all around. The chicken noodle soup was so-so. The place was a little dicey. Just a general disappointment. You could do much better."}
{"text":"It is so delicious and im always satisfied with their sandwich ! Thumbs up! I love the cheese steak and the bobbie !"}
{"text":"9 in. Bobbie is $8.65 including tax.  This is such a great deal for thanksgiving in a sandwich!

The cranberry, mayo, stuffing and shredded turkey are just to DIE for.  If you haven't had the Bobbie, you haven't lived.  I remember first having a Bobbie in 2000, so I've been living for 11 years now. :)

The employees here are very friendly, the store is always clean and has the typical Capriotti's decor. The food comes rather quickly and for this location, I've seen it very busy, but always had a place to sit.

I like the fact that this Capriotti's is nestled into the shopping center where there are a lot of other food choices, including: Yogi's Teriaki, Long John Silvers, KFC, Taco Bell and Robertos.

This location is a winner.  The food is consistent and the value is awesome."}
{"text":"This place right down the street from a relative's place so we visited this place yesterday.  

The food came quickly and the staff was friendly.  I got away with a large \"Bobbie\" -- THANKSGIVING in a roll.  I haven't had this in a while and it is just as good as I remember it.  The bobby has turkey, stuffing and cranberry!

I've frequented this particular location in the past, probably about 8 years ago.  Parking is a little tight at this location in my opinion.

I would still prefer to drive the little extra distance to the location by my work by the area of Tropicana and Fort Apache or by my home by the area of Town Center & Summerlin Parkway."}
{"text":"Went here tonight and got two cheesesteaks, one of which the meat was burnt and the onions were burnt black. The sandwich was dry and one of the worst sandwiches I have ever had, also didn't have much meat. The Capriottis on Flamingo is a 5 star place and they always give you so much meat and everything is always cooked perfectly. This is not a good Capriottis."}
{"text":"I ordered a Capastrami and a Bobbie. The Capastrami I ate within a few minutes of leaving (it's takeout only, so we ate at South Point). The sandwich was incredible. I have 2 restaurants near me that serve giant pastrami sandwiches with cole slaw, and the one from Capriotti's was definitely competitive. The medium was a great size.

When I got home to Los Angeles, my girlfriend and I split the Bobbie. It was definitely tasty, but I prefer cream cheese to mayonnaise on my thanksgiving-style sandwiches. The sandwich was a little dry, and only had slightly above average flavor.

All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to friends, and I will try to visit the Beverly Hills location. I just can't give 5 stars because of the dining situation and the dry Bobbie."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches.   I can never decide between the capastrami or the cheese steak.   Go with other people so you can order both and just share and you can't go wrong.     The small sandwich is more like a large sub, bread is always fresh and packed with meat.   If you are ordering the cheese steak and want some heat, get it with hot peppers.  I usually request light hot peppers so my mouth isn't on fire while I eat.   Sandwiches are always made to order and taste delicious, always hits the spot.   Wish they had more locations in Cali."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm cheating on The Bobbie - my former favorite sandwich that is pretty much Thanksgiving in a sandwich... BUT I must give a shout-out to my other two loves... the CheeseSteak AND the Capastrami w/ everything on them.  Totally hits the spot when you're craving a \"gourmet\" sandwich."}
{"text":"Ok it's a chain, so there's that...  But I'm like Bro'man and we luv us a good sammich!   And Capriotti's didn't disappoint there.

I went at an odd time and had the place to myself, it was quite clean and instead of just hanging out BS'ing the people were busy taking care of the place.

So the menu - short and sweet, that's how I like it.  Unlike a place like the friggin Cheezecake Crapory with it's 80,000 menu items, none of them done well, Capriotti's keeps it under control and turns out a tasty sammy.  

I had the turkey sub with spicy peppers, mmm mmmm.  I love the fresh roasted turkey like that, and the \"just like grandma made\" pickles.  Well not like either of my grandma's made, but someone's grandma...  The veggies passed the fresh & crispy test with flying colors and the sub roll was perfectly soft and chewy.

Ya it's slightly on the higher end fast sandwich price range, but its quality and pretty filling.  I made 2 meals out of the 9\", with the meal deal right around $10.  

I have a Groupon for the place and can't wait to take my good friend and get him hooked.  Next victim on my list:  the Bobbie!!"}
{"text":"This is my fifth year living here in Las Vegas, and I finally remembered to try this place.  I had \"The Bobbie\", which is what they're known for.  It is real pulled turkey, cooked on the premises.  with stuffing and cranberry sauce on it.  It also has mayonnaise on it, but I don't eat it and even if I did, I can't imagine having mayo and cranberry sauce together?!  The sandwich was so good.  My only slight disappointment is that the sandwich was not hot.  I would assume that the turkey and stuffing would be warm.  But, it was still very good.  The service is very friendly and fast.  It was very clean in there.  And they have Wise Potato Chips, which I love and are not so easy to find.  I thought for the quality the price was very good as well.  I know whenever I'm in the mood for a good turkey sandwich again, I will be going back here."}
{"text":"I live down the road from here and absolutely love Capriotti's! Best subs in Vegas and like that they will customize subs for you, even if its their specialty sub!

My parents come into town from Wisconsin and this is a must stop!!!"}
{"text":"So I was jonesing for Capriotti's again. I went there just after they opened, around 11am, knowing they'd be getting busy, as it was nearing the lunch hour. Ordering was just fine, but it took really long for it to come out. People who came in after me, were ordering and getting theirs first.???  I believe they only had two people working. 

Any ways...  I like the Capture 2: The Bobby, hot except the Cranberries. And this time I tried the chicken noodle soup. I got it to go and took it back home, which is somewhere around five minutes. It tasted like it had been sitting for a little while, it was not at all how my first experience was. It was so soggy my sandwich fell apart  (the cranberries/juice were right in the crease of the bread). Had this been my first experience, I don't know if I'd return   

*However, the soup was good  

I will definitely be back, searching for that perfect sandwich once again..... Won't let one bad experience stop me"}
{"text":"Look I won't be long winded, because with a good take out joint you don't have to be. Forget about service, atmosphere, decor and all of the other crap that consumes us when we go to have a meal out on the town. This place is just good, no great! 

Get the Bobbie now! The large will feed you for two meals. The prices are sens able and the quantities are large. Call ahead, go pick it up and prepare to pig out. You can't not like this place, and if you do I will meet you in the parking lot to fight for it's honor."}
{"text":"Want something cheap?  That will fill you up while you're watching your sports game and waiting for your ticket to come in?  This is your place.  For under $10, you'll get a sandwich that will leave you with a gut busting sense of fullness, chips, and a soda.  Get the Bobbie - it's Thanksgiving between two slices of bread.  Can't beat it.  The Italian isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich shop. I'm from the East coast which is well known for their wide array of great sandwich shops so it's hard to surprise me out here when I find a great one.  I just found one closer to me in Chandler in Dana Park too."}
{"text":"Hot sandwiches were good. The cold sandwiches were very plain. No mayonnaise no mustard had to ask for it. No salt pepper. Only meat cheese lettuce tomato and onion. Nothing special. I could have done better."}
{"text":"Good value for huge sandwiches! they deliver to the convention center."}
{"text":"Totally overrated... the subs are nothing special with flavor or quality. Yes, better than subway but there are WAY better sandwich places - Quiznos is better and I don't go there either unless someone else insists.  There are at least 5 better places, not even considering grocery stores have better quality and selection!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great sammies... I especially love The Bobbie. It's like a thanksgiving leftover sandwich...yum!"}
{"text":"5 out of tens times this location on Sahara has no delivery service here in Las Vegas!  When we do get our order delivered or picked up for our company ... something is always' WRONG or FORGOTTEN!    This franchise will never make it to the big leagues and a smart competitor will comes along and show them how it's suppose to be done!    A shame the sandwich's are good, but pricey!   Good Luck & Good Riddance!"}
{"text":"The Cole Turkey is a really great sandwich. The second time I ordered it I opted for extra Russian  dressing and no mayo. The meat is real roasted turkey and is very good. The bread is soft and this sandwich is really more of a meal. My boyfriend loves the sweet & savory Bobbie (thanksgiving style sandwich). He usually orders the medium and I will order the smaller one which is plenty filling for me! Last time we had friends in town we ordered the biggest sandwich they have, cut it up, and shared it together."}
{"text":"Haiku Review: Installment 74

Oh Capriottis,
Your steak sandwich makes me smile.
I love buns n' meat."}
{"text":"Took about 20 minutes to make my sandwich with only 3 people ahead of me. Also there's no reason for them to wear gloves as they'll type in the register and take your order holding a pen with gloves on then turn around n make a sandwich. Not going to this location anymore."}
{"text":"Bobbie, I love you! No, not Bobbie Flay, \"THE BOBBIE\" sandwich! I have to say, whenever I think of home and mom's thanksgiving dinner, I go overboard and order the large and eat the whole darn thing. Yes, it is a lot of food, but it is SOOOO worth it darling. Sometimes I just get the roasted turkey with lettuce, tomato, mayo, sweet peppers, salt and pepper. The hot stuff is good too... I just luvvvvv it."}
{"text":"Delicious Philly/Delaware style subs.  Capriottis has been a favorite of mine since spending summers in my youth in the PA/DE/MD Tri-State area.  The story of Capriottis coming west to Las Vegas is a great American Success story.

I have spent all my time at another Capriottis location when in Las Vegas, and on this day I gave the shop on Paradise a shot.  The food was good not great, the sandwich was carelessly made and the store was not exactly clean.  I still recommend to anyone to eat here, but I am throwing it out for the owner to put a little more scrutiny on this location."}
{"text":"I come here for the famous Bobbie. It's thanksgiving in a sandwich. The best part is that it's available all year round and you don't have to slave in the kitchen for hours.  When i'm craving a hot sandwich the cheese steak with mushrooms, onions, and peppers has never disappointed me. Just today I decided to switch it up and got the chicken cheese steak and  I didn't regret my choice.

This location is across the street from my apartment. I can make it there and back in my apartment in 15 minutes enjoying my sandwich. So needless to say I have been to this location many times. 

Friendly, courteous, clean and speedy staff. What more can you ask for in your neighborhood sandwich shop. 

There was this one occasion though that they were so speedy when I got home and opened up that butcher paper I found a Bobbie massacre. The cranberry sauce ratio to sandwich was ridiculous it was a red mess. I have since forgiven them and have been back. But watch your consistency and we'll have a long and happy relationship."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and the following items are as follows. 

6/10 cran slam: dry meat, low flavor, small portion of cran, very nice bread, iceberg lettuce brings no flavor but a small crunch.

8/10 meatball: your basic meatball sub. Doesn't standout. 

I would not recommend this place if you know how to make a sandwich. Save the time and money and do it yourself.  This place shouldn't be allowed to claim \"best sandwich\". Theres nothing I recall other than simple sandwichea and poor service."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible. Not for the food. For the manager Ditas. Had a coupon for free 6 inch with a purchase of a sanwhich. She have me attitude the moment we told her we had a coupon. Then it wasn't working for some reason. I come to capriottis ALOT. I have spent so much money with them it's not even funny. The manager just had a horrible attitude the entire time. My husband went to sign the receipt, he went to grab the pen from her and she threw the pen in front of him... We asked for one to be a combo and very Rudly said anything else before I hit the button... then my husband asked for a side of mayo. He got it  and walked away and she turned to her employee and whispered something to her while looking at me. When she saw I looked she turned away quickly... I can't beleive this is the customer service they are giving out. Especially the manager!!! I'm so pissed off. I will not be returning to any capriottis any longer. I will be going to straight from philly down the street from now on. She has been smiling so big and saying thank you to everyone else and she gives us a bad look.... this is rediculous I'm going to corporate. She doesn't deserve a job here. I think she is racist."}
{"text":"I looooove sammiches and Capriottis serves up some of the best in town.

As a student I am so thankful that they opened this location up right by campus. Just east of UNLV, this Capriottis is located in one of the busier shopping centers right off the strip. As one of the few 24/7 Capriottis, they get alot of traffic from tourists around the area. The dining room is small and easily gets crowded during lunch. Thankfully the staff has always been friendly and works quick. The sandwiches here are just like the other Capriottis in town: delicious. Due to its great location, this Capriottis always seems to get pretty busy. If your not dinning in, I strongly recommend calling in your order.

The menu features a wide selection of hot and club subs. Big shout out to them for making an excellent Tofu/Turkey sub making Capriottis a great spot for vegetarians as well.
Check out my persona favorite: The Bobbie, their signature 'Thanksgiving Sub\" complete with turkey, cranberry, mayo and stuffing. Though it may seem odd, definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Hands down The Bobbie is best sandwich I have ever had.  The staff was friendly, fast, and efficient.  I was in Scottsdale on business and wish we had Capriotti's in my home town.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I loved this place and went there for years. Unfortunately they have downsized the portions inside the sandwiches and therefore the taste.  Sorry they were much better years ago. Lost my vote"}
{"text":"capriotti's is still my all time favorite sandwich spot in las vegas.  my favorite sandwich is the capistrami.  you can get an 18\" sandwich packed with pastrami and their secret russian sauce for $12!  the sandwich can seriously feed three people.  love their sauce and jalapenos with the capistrami."}
{"text":"Reallly enjoy the Bobby (turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing!), the Chicken Cheesesteak sandwich, Pastrami, and the bread they use is always really good..."}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. I will NEVER return to this location. Started with no acknowledgement when I walked in, as well as the entire restaurant smelling like rotten eggs. I previously called an order in over the phone (and the woman taking the order was rude as well). I saw the size of the salads and wanted to order another one (since it was intended for 2 people), the hostess (I'm guessing her name is Claudia-per my receipt) and she acted like I was a major inconvenience for adding a second salad. The major complaint I had was asking for more salad dressing. I asked for a couple sides, when another girl came from the back and handed me one cup of dressing that was completely covered in dressing. I notified them that the cup was a mess, and asked for another side of dressing, and she proceeded to hand me ANOTHER cup of dressing completely drenched in its dressing. It was almost as if she literally dipped the cup in the sauce and had no care about getting me a new clean cup. It was literally all over my to-go bag, my fingers/hands, and the counter. These two girls working at the 2:00 hour today, Sunday 2/18, were BEYOND rude, complete lack of customer service. And then to top it all off, the quality of the sandwiches were AWFUL. Brown lettuce, soggy onions, bread falling apart, incorrect sandwich order, salads completely missing components listed on the menu.. Overall a huge waste of my time and money."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment after being a regular in Las Vegas.  Was excited to try one in Phoenix and it was just bad.  Dirty and grimy everywhere, vents and soda station full of grime and sticky syrup, front counter as well.  You can they never clean.  But the real issue was the team.  They were miserable.  No personality or smiles from the cashier I thought maybe she was just having a bad day but then our food took a while and then finally got the 2nd sandwich made and I guess the order before wasn't cleared on the screen so the manager made it but the girl had already taken it out so he was all pissed off and cursing and she was like \" I ONLY HAVE TWO HANDS\" etc.  Just bad vibe bad employees, bad manager and dirty place.  Wont be back thats for sure."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a sandwich. Come here every time I come to Las Vegas. Hard pressed to find a better place to grab a bite to eat if your in a hurry. Love the turkey sandwich with the stuffing...eat it every time. Also recently tried the philly cheese steak...keep it up"}
{"text":"The Bobbie was good. If you like Thanksgiving food, you'll like this one. It had turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. Another good one was the Capastrami. I liked the cole slaw on that one. Will come back"}
{"text":"Holy crap on a cracker... The Bobbie sandwich is a little bit of heaven on a plate.  Perfect stuffing, the pulled turkey a fantastic touch, just the right amount of mayo and cranberry...

Highly, highly recommended"}
{"text":"OMG! My sandwich was huge (9\" is the smallest you can get and I suspect it was bigger than advertised. I got the firecracker turkey and it sure was fiery! The turkey is real turkey too! Not processed stuff... in fact, I came across 2 slivers of turkey bone while eating my sandwich -- so be careful! Despite the bones, it WAS delicious. I need to find a lunch buddy to split with in the future, so I don't gorge myself on the whole thing in one sitting, like I did today!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place - especially since its right next to my office - but it just doesn't stand out.  Sure the cheesesteak's are tasty and their 'thanksgiving sub' unique, but that's about it.  It takes them quite a while to make anything, including salads for some reason.  And the prices are steeper than other similar sandwich shops in the area."}
{"text":"Bought two 20\" sandwiches one philly and one chicken philly all the ends had no meat just bread...will never ever return to this location."}
{"text":"Service was fast and the food is delicious!
I am trying their new capture 2 deal....the balsamic chicken salad is so good!"}
{"text":"Pretty straight forward, order your sandwich and get the F outta the way.  Pay when the Sammie is done. The best Chix cheese I've ever had."}
{"text":"Not only are Capriotti's subs the best, but I absolutely love this particular location. They always get the order perfect. The manager Josh is so nice and welcoming and just one of the friendliest managers I have met. He always greets us when we come in. Yesterday I was trying to use my app to get rewards and his employee was still learning (he appeared to be new there) and he was so patient with him in showing him how to handle doing rewards. We love going to this location just because of the manager."}
{"text":"This is the place to go, amazing food. Owner takes pride in his work.. the smoothies are great"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and we just wanted to grab a quick lunch and seen the \"voted worlds best sub sandwich\" we quickly found out that it was false advertising there was 4 of us and not one of use enjoyed our sandwiches I highly recommend skipping this restaurant and spending your money on something actual enjoyable"}
{"text":"Surprisingly pleased with how good the food was. First time eating at Capriotti's ever and it was a nice change. Reminded me a lot of Panera but the portions much larger. My husband and two kids are all of their food including me. We will be back."}
{"text":"This location is really fast when making your food. I ordered 2 x 20\" sandwiches and they took less than 5 minutes. The sandwiches were amazing with the perfect amount of sauce and perfect amount of meat.  I took it to go and was quite satisfied. 

It's definitely not your ordinary sandwich shop!"}
{"text":"I love the Bobby!  Thanksgiving on a roll... They have the best turkey of any sandwich shop, hands down. It's not turkey product, but the real deal. 

The one near us is a little slow, but worth the wait. I usually call ahead and then go get it. It's a little more $$, but worth it."}
{"text":"The capastrami was very delicious and I would definitely go back again. However, be prepared to food coma and potentially having to hit the toilet if the combination of meat and sauces does not sit well with your stomach."}
{"text":"I gave this place four stars. I would have given it five but for some reason something felt off. I knew this place had recently opened so I was expecting something great. But it really wasn't. 
And for some reason everyone felt the need to help the cashier. When she was doing great. Like two stepped on toes literally got in front of her and started working cash. And to me that's rude and very unprofessional. Like give her a chance. With only two people in line give her a second. The food was alright. And the team was really quite. But that's okay. I'll come back and try again hopefully when they have everything down packed and people aren't like cockroaches trying to do everything at once for everyone. We live and learn let's make mistakes for that reason to help and learn."}
{"text":"Best sandwich I have ever had! The Bobbie is the best, it's like Thanksgiving exploded in your mouth. They roast their own turkey perfectly moist, the rolls are soft and delicious. My only complaint is there are not enough locations. I would love to see one of these in the Sacramento area!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was good, as I have come to expect from Capriotti's. The Capistrami didn't disappoint and the Mrs. was pleased with her Bobbie. This location doesn't offer fountain drinks, which was a bit of a letdown. Canned sodas are $1.00 and bottles are $1.80. The staff was pleasant and friendly enough. I will return."}
{"text":"I had no idea this location existed and had it not been for a couple of co-workers who had a craving, probably never would have. Very near Sahara and LV Blvd., I wasn't really sure what to expect. Much to my surprise, it was very clean and unexpectedly big on the inside. I've been to a few Capriotti's locations where you can barely turn around, but this place has a huge dining area and open kitchen where you can see the magic take place. Our sandwiches were out in a flash and it was service with a smile all around. My Slaw-be-joe was as good as ever and I devoured every inch. The only drawback for me was no fountain drinks. Bottles only, but they do offer a wide variety of options. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Part of the group wanted Capriotti's and the others wanted Rubio's. It worked out well because the food court at the Aliante Casino has both. I went with Cap's and got the Slaw Be Joe. I love this sandwich. The combination of roast beef, cole slaw and Russian dressing is fantastic. They did it up right with generous portion sizes. One in the group got the cheese steak and said it was great. The other got the ever popular Bobbie, which was overly heavy on the cranberry. The staff was friendly and I got a free large fountain drink for my check-in on Yelp."}
{"text":"Chicken philly is totally awesome.....and I highly recommend it. The parking can be challenging at this location but if your looking for a great sandwich at a decent price then it is worth it. Make sure you get fried onions....sweet peppers and mushrooms on the chicken philly when you order it. I also recommend the hot peppers but be advised they are VERY HOT....so if your not into that then make sure to get the sweet peppers. Eat, Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Well...if there is a sandwich shop that deserves 10 stars this one does. Five stars does not do it justice......I mean the service...the price....and man the FOOD....was top notch. I really didn't know what to expect because my wife had mentioned this place to me before we came out here....and she had it on good recommendation that this was the ultimate sandwich spot to visit. The situation was funny too because we only ended up going here because we wanted some lunch and planned to go to Serendipity 3 on the STRIP....but i wasn't going to spend 30 dollars for lunch.

So my wife remembered what her cousin had said about this place...we put the address in the GPS....and off we went. It is less than 5 minutes from the strip....and trust me you won't regret going there. People say the \"Bobbie\" is the sandwich to have but i had the Chicken and Cheese with onions...hot peppers...and sweet peppers....size medium....and WOW. Simply one of the best sandwiches i have ever had. 

Here is the Best part....we got 2 sandwiches for about 17 bucks....and on my receipt i there was an online survey that you take and you get 3 bucks off your next sandwich. I am going back tonight and get me another one...that is just how great this place is. So if your ever in Vegas and want a great sandwich at a great price.....run don't walk to Capriotti's . Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars. Great value for your money. Top notch ingredients and their cheesesteak tastes just like the ones on the east coast!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed. Great, bad for you sandwiches that will push back whatever diet you think your on at least a day. Not a regular stop, but an infrequent indulgence I will look forward to."}
{"text":"I just ordered a sandwich that I made up called the Marco (Italian sausage/meatball). This sandwich is a lil expensive but well worth the money. I love this sandwich shop. The food is always top notch and made fresh. This location even delivers. Love the food here and so will you."}
{"text":"Food here is amazing even though it is a franchise. My wife swears by the Bobby and I love the cheesesteak or grit (Grilled Italian). Best franchised sandwich shop period."}
{"text":"Food is always good. I love the GRIT and Cheesesteak. My wife loves the BOBBY. The best sandwich franchise around. We love to go their."}
{"text":"Be sure not to let them over do it with their herb blend....yikes. Also, the turkey was really dry. The staff, on the other hand, very nice."}
{"text":"Okay, so I've now eaten here three times, and have tried two different Sandwiches. I can honestly say that It's generic and bland. Their Cheesesteak needs something to season it, even with hot peppers and onions, its still dull. The Tuna was too fishy tasting, almost like they didn't do anything special with it. Their cookies are dull. This place needs work, I'm not sure how they won best sandwich shop. Avoid this place unless you want to pay too much for food an amateur could make at home."}
{"text":"great sandwich shop i never have a bad experience here. 

try the turkey
the Bobbie
the capistrami"}
{"text":"For them to have 4 stars is a joke. This place is honestly one of the worst places I've ever eaten at. For them to call \"the bobby\" an award winning sandwich is the biggest joke I've ever seen. I took 3 bites and threw it out and the employees said even we won't eat the food here. That's telling you something."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches, I'd rather eat a sandwich than any other food. I love good delis but they can be hard to find and many towns do not have one at all. I'm not talking Subway but a real Deli.

Capriottis is a chain and not as good as what you'll find in NY or Chicago they get very close to it.

I've had everything on the menu at various times and locations and I can't say I've every had a bad sandwich, just that some I liked more than others.

The place could use some decor, some dressing up a bit, and I would have given it 5 stars it if worked a little more on putting on a good face. I

But if you need a whole in the wall with good filling food made to order, and your not planning on staying there to eat it, I would recommend it. Grab a great sandwich, some chips and an drink and take it back home, to a park or your hotel room. Don't even think of going to Blimpies, Portasub, Subway or even Earl of sandwich. None of them can hold a candle to any Capriotti's location."}
{"text":"Great Sandwiches, definitely get what you pay for,  Quality. Large Philly is perfect, half for lunch and half for dinner."}
{"text":"Enourmous hot and cold sub sammies with a few original creations. Subway and blimpie beware, the Capriottis chain puts you to shame. Their signature sub, the Bobbie is basically Thanksgiving on a hero, freshly in house roasted slabs of carved turkey slathered with homemade stuffing, jellied cranberry sauce and mayo. Both a mess of a dish and one of lifes great guilty pleasures. The Capistrami is loaded with lean hot pastrami, sweet coleslaw, melted cheese and slathered in a robust 1,000 dressing and nicknamed the \"shirt killer\" as this monstrous hero has ruined many shirts, I'm sure. A lesser known hero and my personal favorite is thr hot italian, a plethora of salamis, hams and other pork products grilled hot the regrilled on the roll, with melted swiss or provolone and roasted sweet and hot peppers. The high grade ham crisps up on the edges and the heat of the meats releases just the right amount of greasy juices that mingle with the sweet and spicty tang of the roasted peppers and the bite of pepper and seasoning in one of te cured salamis makes a heavenly combination.... Alas, there are no Capriotti's near me anymore, though in reality that alone will probably save a year or two of my life. Definitely not for the calorically challenged people out there."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I was a skeptic about Capriotti's.  After all I am from Pittsburgh.  Home of the Primanti sandwich, Real McCoy's, Uncle Sam's, Triangle Bar subs, and Fatheads.  Let me tell you.  This will be a regular stop when we visit Vegas again!  I had the 9 inch Capristrami sandwich. The first thing I noticed was the softness of the bun.  Even though the Capistrami is a hot sandwich, only the meat is cooked.  

The meat was plentiful and the flavor of the coleslaw and thousand island dressing was great.  After I in hailed that sub I had to try another.  I ordered a plain cold Italian sub.  I figured I could have a bite or two and save the rest for later.  It was so good that I in hailed half of it.  I couldn't control myself!  

Now I think we are clear that the food is incredible, but let me tell you about the staff.  Even though this had been my first visit to Capriotti's the people working there acted as if I had been going there for years.  I actually felt kind of bad when the girl who I paid for the meal started asking me about my day and plans etc.  I didn't expect that. 

Then, after I ate half of my second sub and asked for a bag, they told me to give it to them so they can rewrap it in fresh paper and then gave me a bag!

They also informed me that they deliver to the local hotels for only a $3.00 delivery charge!  This is cheaper than room service's $5.00 delivery charge!

So, I am a believer and definitely recommend Capriotti's to anyone who likes sandwiches!"}
{"text":"How the heck can you run out of bread as a McDonald's run out of burgers I've never seen such a mismanaged such a ill-fated run shop it's like a tire shop saying we ain't got no tires I understand you may be running out of one item but the bread the main thing on a Saturday night at 7 o'clock they need to fire whoever runs this place and the district manager to because he's not smart enough to go to another store and bring that store some bread"}
{"text":"It was a decent sub, nothing super fantastic. Firehouse makes a better sub. They need to start having whole wheat bread."}
{"text":"We only get to come once a year as we are from out of town, but every year they make it worth the drive! The Capastrami is my favorite but all the sandwiches are great! The bread is always fresh and the folks behind the counter always serve with a smile :) I would highly recommend stopping in for a quick meal for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"So much better than Subway or the other pretenders.

A 9-inch sandwich for $6.75 is awesome and more than enough food, and not just a bread filler.  Locally owned, I met the guy today at lunch and actually told him about Yelp so he'll be checking his reviews out, but he was really nice as were the guys taking orders and making the food.  This place gets busy at lunch as the business people around know where to eat when it's good.  I've heard a few of my cop buddies say how good it is too and they weed out all the bad places pretty quick.

Anyways, the sandwiches are really good and all the meat, cheeses and all the fixin's are really fresh and always plentiful on your sandwich.

And look for the \"Bobby\"... It's like your whole Thanksgiving dinner exploding in your mouth... turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce... I'm serious it's so good.

Enjoy guys... it's really good food for a great price."}
{"text":"Well, I should have taken my own advice and not ordered from this location.  The sandwiches are always good from Caps but more often than not, they're made incorrectly. 

I was moving the other weekend and decided to order Caps for my friends that were helping me. I placed a catering order two days ahead of time. I ordered a small tray which has three different sandwiches included. I ordered a Bobbie, an Italian and ham with cheese. My ONLY request was that the sauces, like mayo and mustard, be on the side so the sandwiches won't get soggy. They offered for some pickles and olives to be on the side as well which I agreed to. Million, the manager, took this order. He also called me the morning of the pickup to verify everything. I had my hopes riding pretty high that this was going to go well. I was wrong. 

The sandwiches ended up being made with NOTHING on them except meat and cheese. No lettuce. No tomato. No onion. We had to ask for the sauces after all as they didn't have them ready. I found this out once the catering tray was at the new home I moved to. They forgot to send me with all the veggies and never packed cranberry sauce...for the Bobbie. 

I called to notify them of the issue. Million told me I should check my bags again to make sure because he thought I definitely had everything I needed. After checking again I told him I was bringing it all back for a refund. Once I showed up with all the original food, the two girls making sandwiches profusely insisted that I just pickup all the missing items and bring them back to the house. Apparently my time driving across town to get the correct order is of no consideration at all. I finally told them how ridiculous it is that they couldn't provide me with HALF of what a sandwich is made of. Million wouldn't even come out of the office to show his face or apologize. Coward. 

All franchises are not created equal. I'll never use this location again. It's been nothing but a disappointment. You're just making sandwiches....last time I checked, it wasn't that hard."}
{"text":"Speechless.  We were in town for several days for a kids soccer tournament and the boys needed something between games. \"Lets grab a sandwich\".....This is no ordinary sandwich, this is a spiritual experience. DAMN !   We must have gone back 5 times. Great place. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber Eats and was shorted some  item's, Called to try to get the bill àdjusted and was hung up on twice. Wouldn't go there again even if it was free. Shame on owners"}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest sandwich fan, but Capriottis has defnitely opened my eyes to the BEST sandwiches I have ever had at a sandwich shop. The first time I ever tried it was in Las Vegas, so I am happy to see that Capriottis is spreading across the states. I originally got hooked on \"The Bobbie,\" which is Thanksgiving dinner in a roll of bread. At my most recent visit, however, I decided to venture out from my original fav and got the \"Slaw-be-Joe.\" I was not disappointed! It was filled with tender roast beef, provolone cheese, coleslaw, and a mayo dressing. Capriottis beats all the other sandwich shops out there... hands down!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good but they aren't constantly good. Sometimes dry bread, sometimes overly sauced (like dripping oil EVERYWHERE), sometimes temperature on them isn't right, sometimes the quality isn't the same and sometimes portions aren't right like little meat and lots veggies type of thing. So its kinda hit and miss type of place."}
{"text":"I have came here for a while! Everyone is always nice, and my sandwiches are always perfect. It's one of the only places my brothers actually eat from, and the employees are always accommodating and easy to communicate with. Chips and drinks are always kept up and have lots of options."}
{"text":"I think this wins as my #1 favorite place for a sub. As a vegetarian it can be hard finding amazing creative subs that aren't just veggies and cheese.

I have tried the regular Vegetarian turkey, the Veggie Cheese Steak, and OMG the Veggie Cole Turkey. The Veggie Cole Turkey= life changing. The combination of tofurkey, cole slaw, cheese, and Russian dressing is absolutely fantastic. This place is great for sandwiches that are a little out of the ordinary, which I love.

They would have 5 stars based solely off food, but I had to knock one off due to service. I have had my order screwed up multiple times here. Like they have given me the completely wrong sandwich more than once. Also I don't know if he is still there, but there was a cashier there who really gave me the creeps for some reason.

Oh, and if you choose to be on their texting list, they will send you deals all the time. Usually a free upgrade to a larger sandwich size, or free chips/cookie/drink.

Overall this place is great. I will certainly continue to be a return customer!"}
{"text":"This place has really good sandwiches!!! We got out of a show and called our order in then headed over to pick up. They seem very rushed and rude on phone but in person they are nice. The sandwiches are tasty and fair pricing for how much of a sandwich you get!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Service at this location has been sub par every time I've been. I've also been a few times when their hours say they should be open only to find they've closed early. In short, food is good; service, not so much."}
{"text":"I've been fatting down at Capriotti's Sandwich Shop ever since I set up camp in Las Vegas almost two years ago. Why do I keep returning, you ask? Because I consistently get a good sandwich without the awkward salad-tossing mongoloid named Jared.

The meat, vegetables, bread, and just about everything is PERFECT at Capriotti's. Even the service. The ONLY areas that keep them from a perfect rating is price and lack of side dishes. While I understand that I am reviewing a sandwich shop, it frustrates the hell out of me that you can't get a single side dish. ESPECIALLY when you already have stuffing and cranberry sauce (from the Bobbie) and coleslaw (SlawBeJo) for the sandwiches.

Capriotti's Sandwich Shop has a massive variety of just about anything you can put between buns (Take those nasty thoughts to the strip, people). With a great selection for EVERYONE, from us normal humans to you tree-humping vegetarians, there is a sexy sandwich waiting for YOU at Capriotti's!

PS - One important thing to note about Capriotti's is that the sandwiches/subs/whatever-the-hell-you-get are almost as good the second and third day (due to the greatness of the bread). Take notes, Scrubway."}
{"text":"Cute lil joint. The lady who takes your order is loud but nice. Sodas are a bit pricey at $2.50 a can, but for 50cents more you can buy a beer! Ordered the egg salad, loud lady said it was a good choice, asked if I could add avacado on it and she said NO! Rude! After that the service was pretty non-existant and I wasn't the only patrom who noticed. They need to hire a little more help for the lunch rush! Next time I'll take my order to go."}
{"text":"Ever get cravings for Thanksgiving dinner in March?   I did.  I went in to Capriotti's for lunch to see how they would put Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich. To my taste bud's pleasure, it was a hit.   I ordered the Cran Slam Club which has Turkey, ham, cranberry sauce, lettuce and mayo on three layers of your choice of bread.  To bad I forgot to request some stuffing on my sandwich to really hit my craving out of the ballpark.

Walking in to Capriotti's its casual, clean and nicely decorated. Located in the Uptown area of Phoenix where there are plenty of shops, wine bars and restaurants to visit.  If you have time, I suggest you visit some of the shops.

The sandwich was great.  Again, I wish I would have remembered to ask for stuffing on my sandwich, which I hear the stuffing is made everyday.  The turkey was juicy and shredded.  Ham was delicious.  The sandwich is large and filling.  I ate half of the sandwich and saved the other half for dinner which, by the way, kept well.  Next time I think I will try the Bobbie sandwich which looks delicious!"}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest Capriottis I've ever been to. Each time I'm here, the wait to order is 10 minutes or more. Food is good. Just be prepared to wait a while."}
{"text":"This joint has been on my \"to try\" list for a few years... sadly, it was underwhelming.  We got a couple different footlongs to share and try: the Italian sausage & the Philly.  While the Philly was better than average, the Italian sausage was disappointing to say the least.  Our order was take out, around lunch time and since we only live five minutes away I felt we truly gave it a fair shot.  Would the Italian have been better if they had packed the marinara sauce to dunk it in / pour over it?  Probably... but that point is moot since they forgot.  The bread did not taste fresh, despite a lunch order on a Friday, and when I was there the service was less than stellar.  If I ever give it another shot, I'll try the Thanksgiving sando due to the rave reviews from peeps I trust, but who knows if that will ever happen."}
{"text":"It was one of those tired nights where we supposedly wanted something \"small\" since we just had a pretty big meal. My brother suggested Capriotti's. I was stoked as I wanted to try that place the last time we visited.

Browsed the menu and I chose the Slaw BeJo which has roast beef, provolone cheese, russian dressing, and cole slaw. It looked unbelievable in the pictures on their menu. My sister-in-law suggested me end my hubs share a large so I chose that (mind you I had no idea it would almost be the same length of a school bus). My family also ordered the Capastrami and Cole Turkey and a chopped italian salad.

We went to pick up our order and the bag with the sandwiches in it weighed as much as a toddler. The sandwiches were huge! It could probably feed me for a whole week. I could only eat a quarter of the large and it took a few days to finish since we ordered so much. I must say the sandwich was amazing. I wish we had a Capriotti's in Hawaii. They were voted best sandwiches in Best of Las Vegas so it must be good. Delicious.

Now I need to do a Capriotti's run and an In-N-Out run since we don't have those in Hawaii."}
{"text":"Fast and sandwiches are prepared perfectly. I've come in to order or called my order in and they are always spot on!
I have not had a bad sandwich here and never had to wait long to get what I want.
There are several Capriottis in the area and some are better that others, I guess it all depends on who is back there making the subs.
I am glad this store is my local go to place for sub sandwiches, they do a great job.
I really wonder if all the tips they get really goes for beer though.
BEER MONEY!!!!! yeahh, yay, thank you! yah!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here while visiting from MN and our 12 year old son was looking for a place to get a donut. A manager/owner looking man asked what we would like and my wife told him that our son was craving a donut. The man said and I quote \"Scottsdale is a well educated and healthy community so you probably will not find a donut around here\". I think all would agree that is a very elitist and arrogant thing to say to anyone. Needless to say we walked out and will never set foot in another Capriotti's again. It's too bad anyone needs to feel that self important."}
{"text":"I placed an online order to be delivered to our office for a lunch meeting. First they arrived over an hour late. When we called to follow up on the food the person answering the phones was not apologetic and bordering on rude.  When the food finally arrived the order was wrong. They brought a chef salad instead of garden and the person who ordered it is a vegetation so she had to go without lunch. They also brought an extra meatball sub, not sure who that was supposed to be for but I guess that means they had at least two angry customers that day. I honestly feel filling food orders is the easiest job in the world, just double check the bag before it leaves, there's no excuse for this type of mistake. I won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"this is the best sandwich shop ever! I always get the Cheese Steak and my husband gets the Cap Pastrami!! Love this place. I always give a tip!! \"BEER MONEY\" is what they say when someone gives them a tip!!"}
{"text":"I was here on 1/4 and there are lots of 4 star reviews, After eaten the 'Bobby', I'm in full agreement.

Being it's a Turkey sandwich with Cranberry, Stuffing, and mayo,  I thought it was going to be a hot sandwich but to my surprise, it was served cold.

Nonetheless, it works. The Turkey was perfect with a nice taste and texture. The stuffing was flavorful and served on a fresh roll.

BTW: s small sandwich is not so small. I ate at around 12:30 and really couldn't eat the rest of the day. It has to be one of the best deals in Vegas for around $7,"}
{"text":"I usually come here with my fiancé and service is always great, except for today. I had gotten an email for the $2 9inch Bobbie because it's the 200th day of the year. We were so excited but when we got there, my email was turned away. I was told that the email was a mistake and that they weren't honoring it. They were in the wrong and they should take responsibility for it and honor the email. I worked in retail for years and when we miss a \"buy one get one 50% off\", we still honor it when a customer points it out. Then, we take the sign down for future customers. Customers may not always be right but in this situation, we are but yet we were turned away."}
{"text":"\"Sorry, but we temporarily ran out of bread.\"  What else can I say?

Disappointed I guess..."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. Surprisingly delicious sandwich and they have vegetarian meat options which was a surprise. The cashier was very friendly and helpful with good suggestions and the bill was actually cheaper than what was posted on the sign. I will be back."}
{"text":"Oh the memories. My first Capriotti's experience and it didn't disappoint. Of course I got the Bobbie and of course it was excellent. I'm usually not a fan of cranberry on my  food but it really works well with this sandwich. The bread is soft and the turkey is well-seasoned,  roasted  and pulled. I also tried the cheesesteak and I gotta say, it's one of the best I've had. Get it with onions and hot+sweet peppers. 

I've tried the Capriotti's that recently opened near me. I don't know what it is, it just isn't as good as the ones in Vegas. The one in Beverly Hills is pretty good but I'm not a fan of that pretentious area.

If you're in Vegas, stop by and power up with some delicious sandwiches."}
{"text":"Cannot see how they got these many great ratings. Had a signature hot pastrami sub and a salad. Sub was just ok. Sausage just in the middle where they cut the sandw. The rest was just tasteless coleslaw. 
Salad was as cold as it would be shortly before freezing temp. and therefore not pleasant. Salad sauce was prepacked ready mix. 
Not much better than large chains but also not cheap. There are tons of better sandwich shops out there in the country... But maybe not in LV."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I been to a sandwich shop that I yearn to come back to. I can hardly pronounce the name of the shop but I know how to get here every time. I frequent Vegas almost monthly and this is my spot, drunk or sober. I need to take this place and have it next door at home. The staff is kick ass and heavenly is such a sweetheart. I feel comfortable and I climax with every veggie sandwich bite I take. You cannot come to Vegas without eating here. If food were an orgasm it would taste like a Capriottis sandwich. I will probably be here again later tonight. I love this place."}
{"text":"Don't order here to go, there is a disgusting excuse of a female with a nasty nose ring that will give you a look of contempt when you order.  No greeting, no thank you, no nothing. When your food is ready they will make sure they let it sit on the counter for half hour without ever acknowledging that someone could actually be waiting for the food. 

The failed customer service here actually brought the quality of the usually good food way down. Definitely worth driving the extra 2 miles East to their other location where they treat you right. 

Serves me well to order a sandwich from a place that shares space with a gas station. The one star is for the homeless dude sleeping outside this location, he was more pleasant than the people behind the counter."}
{"text":"I ordered three large sandwiches and one sandwich that I ordered with no Peppers and I called saying that I did not request any peppers and I spoke supposedly to the manager and he suggested that I bring back the sandwich today which unfortunately I couldn't due to being occupied at work then suggested I bring back the same sandwich that he messed up on to save it and bring it back the next day."}
{"text":"Duuuude this place rocked my sandwich world! I ordered the capastrami - hot pastrami, coleslaw, melted swiss cheese, russian dressing. The hubby got the bobbie - homemade turkey, cranberry, stuffing and mayo. My capastrami was so tasty...who knew that coleslaw in your sandwich made everything that much better? The bobbie really did remind me of thanksgiving dinner...good and very comforting. The bread also deserves to be mentioned...soft...mmmmm. I went to the location in Red Rock Casino and after a day of swimming in the pool this dinner gave me strength for the long night ahead.

fyi...so many awards - they are zagat rated, best in LV 2008, best inexpensive meal by Frommers etc."}
{"text":"The slowest sandwich shop  have ever been to, a few people waiting and the guy on the grill has to hustle to him at all, at time there isnt even anything on the grill whatsoever. Smh"}
{"text":"I will never come back to this particular establishment. Ordered 7 sandwiches and left a $10 tip. Once we got our sandwiches we asked for extra condiments. After the condiments were given, I was shocked when they asked us to pay for the extra condiments. I gladly did but had then explain their actions. I asked where the sign was, NO SIGN. I asked why he didn't tell me it would be extra when asked for more, NO RESPONSE. I totally understand if I had ordered one or two sandwiches and we're asking for a ton of extra condiments, BUT SERIOUSLY! Spoke with the owner/manager and it seemed like it fell on deaf ears. I even gave the owner/manager (Tony, I believe) an opportunity to try and earn my business, little to no effort. I guess the best way is to inform readers that despite the great food in this establishment, the customer service is way below expectations and you should drive to another location if you want a true Capriottis experience."}
{"text":"Great Sandwich and Customer Service!

I had ordered from Grubhub to get a sandwich from here. I was told about 35 minutes. 1 hour and 35 minutes later I was wondering where my sandwich was. I later found out Grubhub never sent the order to the restaurant. 

I called the restaurant and spoke with the manager. He handled the situation AWESOMELY! He confirmed my info and took my order and hand delivered the sandwich with a free cookie and chips. He even apologized, knowing it wasnt his fault. 

Food was great as always! I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Normally I love capriottis!!!  The bobby cannot be beat.  However here I barely could get it down.   There was barely any stuffing or cranberry sauce.  And was covered in mayonnaise.   Got a salad too and the choice of dressings was none.  There were no vegetables. Paid 7 dollars for lettuce olives and tomatoes.   Go to another capriottis."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Picked it up.  Didn't wait at all. Got the Bobbi.  Was perfect as always.   Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food, nice location, and amazing staff!! Doug is a great manager and has a lot of amazing workers under him! They're also extremely quick here! Highly recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Just having some left over Bobbie sandwich from yesterday. Its even better the day after (kinda like macaroni and cheese).  How is that possible? Keep up the good work my boys...you rock the house :)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, I discovered Capriotti's before I moved to Vegas 7 years ago when I use to stay at the Hard Rock. Back then it was definitely a cure for my hangover being across the street from the Hard Rock!

Two of my favorites are the Philly Cheesesteak and the Meatball subs there hearty and delicious. Always packed is a good sign, staff is friendly and nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Our family had subs from Capriotti's on Paradise last night.  What a treat!  From the moment you walk in you are greeted friendly from the staff, the place is clean and neat.  The Capistrami was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of everything.  The Bobbie is the best sandwich in town!  We gobbled everything down in minutes and can't wait to go back.  We've been faithful Capriotti's customers for 15+ years, but have heard this is the best shop in Vegas for getting the perfect Capriotti's experience.  Way to go!"}
{"text":"Order the Bobbie - you won't regret it!!!! Tastes like Thanksgiving on a sandwich. I love going to Capriotti's for lunch. This location is close to my work so I call it in and go pick it up. Always fresh, very flavorful, high quality food. My favorite is the Bobbie sandwich but their cheesesteak is also tasty - don't forget to add sweet peppers!"}
{"text":"Got a large chicken philly more bread than meat and peppers. One whole quarter of the sand which had less than a table spoon of filling at all. Service is par. Short, not very up beat or happy. Most cappriottis say thanks when you tip but not here. Ice machine had no ice and they didn't seem to care either. Def won't visit this location again."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a shot, wish I hadn't. Quite possibly the worst sandwich I've ever had, the bread was greasy and spongy, I had the veggie cheese steak, the 'chicken' was absolutely disgusting, it was rubbery and had a bitter after taste that I still can't get out of my mouth, and I only had a couple of bites before tossing it out. Being a veggie sandwich isn't an excuse, Cornish pasty makes fantastic things with chicken substitutes, this was just vile.

My roomie said his sandwich was edible but Subway could do better. There are tons of sandwich places around the college, pick any other one and it will be better than this."}
{"text":"I have been going to Capriotti's since they first came to Vegas when I was a kid. Their Bobbie, Cheese-steaks, and Cappastrami have been staples in our family for years, and they truly are delicious! 

Recently though, my husband, my kids and I have become plant-based. We only eat vegan now. With family in town that was craving a typical Capriotti's experience, we hoped we would find a vegan option, such as a sub full of veggies. We tried the veggie burger, no mayo, no cheese...and were quite disappointed. 

I would love to keep supporting this company. As corny and nostalgic as it sounds, Capriotti's is dear to me and my family. It would be so wonderful to be able to order from here any time my meat-eating family members want to, and be able to enjoy something as much as we used to enjoy the other sandwiches. 

I beg the owners to create an amazing vegan option or two...
something loaded with sautéed veggies, vegan mayo, vegan cheese?
a veggie loaded salad?
a garbanzo bean salad sandwich? 
something thats not just a soy-filled meat substitute slapped on bread???? Please!!!!! 

If you build it, the vegans will come! Veganism is growing fast! Please jump on the vegan train! :)"}
{"text":"I was very happy when this location opened not too far from my work location I got hooked on Capriotti's while staying in Las Vegas a year ago. Nicely crafted sandwiches are found right here at this Tempe Capriotti's, the Bobbie's are legendary  and are scrumptious parcels of Thanksgiving anytime you wish to experience it. The Cheese Steaks be they beef or chicken are what you want even when you have no clue what you want; get them with fried onions, sweet or hot peppers, and mushrooms. When you check in here through the Yelp App you get a free bag of chips no purchase necessary. This location is right near ASU across from PF Chang's and parking can be found in the either the structure the meters that are near by."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and the spectacular Bobbie eating at Capriotti's is a must! Beautiful baguettes stuffed with fresh meats and toppings what's not to love? Oh and they make it interesting if you text \"Caps104\" to 25328 by sending you yummy little deals. Cheese-steaks beef or chicken and The Bobbie are my go to sandwiches. I have no doubt the other options are delicious and someday soon I will try something else.  I am very happy to see this brand new Capriotti's in Old Town Scottsdale, and once you have eaten there you will be happy too! Oh yeah this is a combo location; Everything Bagel's is in the same location and they serving homemade bagels and noshes, they are open at 6am M-F and 7am on Sat & Sun so breakfast can be had if you get there too early for a Capriotti's sandwich."}
{"text":"I love the sandwiches here, they serve fresh bread and meat that can't be beat!! Both Chicken and Beef cheese steak are superb and the Bobbie is in a league of it's own. I don't know how I lived on the other Sub chains before finding Capriotti's call in your order and give them about 15 mins and you will be eating shortly upon arrival.  The largest sandwich cost about 12.50 but at 20 inches two people can dine nicely, all I can say is bring your appetite and you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Woot Woot! A new Caps opened in Phoenix and guess what they are Great! Spectacular! Fantastic! I got the Chicken Cheese steak and it was deli-sh. The Bobbie is my go to but I wanted something hot tonight. This location is across the street from the Sunbrite Corner shops. As with most Capriotti's stores there are the Sandwiches, Salads, fresh baked goods, chips and unlimited soda refills.There are a few parking spots in the front and many more in the back pretty soon their on-line ordering system will be up. In the meantime enjoy this new Capriotti's location. Almost forgot they service Beer and wine at this location."}
{"text":"Best cheesesteaks I've had since I left the Northeast.

Love the food, but the tables could be cleaner--hard to do though with that much greasy cheesesteaky awesomeness floating in the air."}
{"text":"Had to spend the day at the courthouse for work. Employees were friendly and fast. You get a good amount of food for the price. My sandwich was bomb.com, and made to my specifications. Would come in again next time I'm in the courthouse."}
{"text":"Love the cranberry sause and turkey sandwich. That said, I've got to be true to my health scale. 2 stars for being just better than a mickey Ds. Change all the sandwich bread to 100% whole wheat and give more vegan options or use free range meat and this would jump to a 4 or 5 start place. That said, I'm starting to get hungry for the cranberry sause now."}
{"text":"Ok food. Minimal interaction with staff. Clean environment. I would prefer panera or subway but I had to try it. 

$11 for soup salad and tea."}
{"text":"Ordered online on the app I guess I ordered at the wrong one and they gladly refunded my BF for the other store and charged for this one. 
Riley was super nice to my BF and apologized because we ordered a roast beef   Sand which and they were out of roast beef ( how do you run out? That's my only reason for four stars instead of 5) 
Good staff. 
Delicious Bobbie as always. 
Good job. 
I recommend this place for sure"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I have ever had!!  

I've been back a few times and always get their signature sandwich, the Bobbie.  Fresh shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, mayo on very fresh tasty bread.  Fantastic!  I've also tried the Italian Grilled Meats and it was delicious, but not quite as good as the Bobbie.  I'd like to try some of their other sandwiches but I just can't not order my favorite.

 A small sandwich is enough for a meal, the medium for 2 and large 20\" is definitely enough for 3-4 people.  They'll cut the sandwich in 1/2, 1/3's or even 1/4's without any problem.

The service is friendly and fast.  You can see them make your sandwich fresh and they do not skimp on the fillings.  

Love this place and glad it's only 10 minutes from home.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"Got \"The Bobbie\" to see what all the hype was about. It honestly wasn't the greatest sandwich I've ever tasted referring to the sandwiches back in San Francisco, but it was pretty good. Better than Subway for sure!"}
{"text":"YUM! 
lunched here with a gf, who had been raving about the Bobbie for SO long; I had a bite and it was pure Thanksgiving deliciousness. 
I ordered the SlawBeJo - roast beef (which is pulled/shredded!), coleslaw, russian dressing... and other deliciousness. it was good. so tasty. 

this... from a picky girl who doesn't care for sandwiches..."}
{"text":"This is a good sandwich shop because you get a lot for your money. And it's a good place to decompress if you want to get away from all the excitement in Las Vegas. When I went there, the place was completely empty! However, don't let that deter you from checking it out.

The only thing this place needs is hot sauce. I'm used to finding that at sandwich shops, and I was surprised to find that they didn't have any here.

Good sandwiches and fun employees make this place worth checking out."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are inventive, but turkey's a little dry. Bread was probably fresh in the morning, a lot \"chewier\" by 3pm. Nothing Bundt Cakes got replaced by some tasteless imitator brand. Working in a service industry, I always cringe when there's a Tip Jar for employees who don't interact with customers. Keep it behind the registers."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this establishment (or the chain itself) but I have to say that I was HIGHLY IMPRESSED. I do a lot of contract work at various sites in the valley and just happened across this place. My personal opinion of this place is an A+ 5-star rating (I wish they had 10)

The staff were friendly, they had a place to sit and eat. Unlimited free refills on soda for the duration of your visit. I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Capriotti's that I have visited. As always the food is 5-stars but I was disappointed that they only offer bottled soda. The location on Craig Rd has a soda fountain and you can get a refill on your drink at no charge. Their prices on chips and drinks is not worth it. The deserts are okay for the price. The staff are nice but the place looks a bit dumpy. Although, I must admit, I go in for the sandwiches and they are great so nothing else matters."}
{"text":"This is by far the best sandwich place in town. Surprisingly good for a chain. I tried it for the first time due to a bad experience at another sandwich place and I am hooked. The meatball sandwich and the Bobbie are insane. Pretty incredible cheesesteak too. The only bad thing is they serve Pepsi... come on guys."}
{"text":"Forget Subway, go here instead...Try \"The Bobbie\" it's like Thanksgiving Dinner in a sub! The Italian sub is pretty tasty too...get extra mayo though, because their subs are kind of dry.  The subs are huge too, its enough for lunch and dinner.  It's a carb. blowout waiting to happen!"}
{"text":"The staff were very friendly and the sandwiches we ordered we delicious. It's a little joint in a strip mall but don't let it fool you. It is definitely worth it a try."}
{"text":"We where so hungry coming from JAX to Las Vegas and need a good quick bite to eat. John our driver was so kind enough to take us to this sandwich shop. We ordered lots of things but my favorite was the Cran Grand Slam. It was good to the tummy. Before I knew it was gone sorry everyone I have no photos.... but trust me great sandwich."}
{"text":"The people working there on Saturday nights close the store whenever they want and well before the 8pm closing time stated on the door and online. They will blatantly ignore the phone and anyone trying to get in from outside. Not sure what happened to this franchise but I am a loyal Capriotti's customer from back east and will never buy anything else from this franchise again."}
{"text":"I really don't like writing bad reviews... But o well.. We come to this place all the time... However, we will never be returning to this location. We are really big on customer service, but everyone has a bad day every one in awhile so we don't pass judgement...but this time I had to complain, im not sure of the guys name but geez was he rude. The lady that helped me was very sweet.. But I couldn't hear her over the jerk in the back making my sandwich that was talking crap about me... I called the wrong store on accident to place my order. When I got there he said there were no orders waiting and thats when i realized i had called the wrong location... I felt bad and said it was okay they didnt have to make it.. The lady that was helpful said it was okay we will make it anyways they still had 10 mins anyways. Then the this kid  started talking crap saying things like i was making up that I called the wrong store so that I can just get them to make my sandwich 10mins before they closed and  \"that's a good one\" and continued to yell out that next time he was gonna walk into a place and \"try that one\" They close 9pm.. It takes all but 5mins to make a quick sandwich. Bad day or night...a customer doesn't need to hear that. I tipped them anyway just to kill them with kindness! From now on I'll make the drive to another location!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is delicious. They have two hallmark sandwiches in my mind, the Bobbie with turkey, cranberry sauce, homemade stuffing and mayo and the Capastrami. If you have vegetarians in the group, encourage them to try the veggie cheese steak which is also surprisingly good."}
{"text":"I have been craving cheesesteaks and being from the east coast it's hard to find a good one. My mom and I decided to try this place today. Great!!! And I will be back. First of all the staff was great, William thank you for you're great customer service! And the cheesesteaks were amazing. Meat well seasoned, hot, and super cheesy. Needless to say this will be my new cheese steak spot!!! Hooray!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a quick bite before leaving Vegas after reading the rave reviews, but I must say it's a mistake to come after eating at Earl of Sandwich the day before. I had the highly rated Bobbi but didn't think anything special of it (probably because it was cold). We were the first ones there after opening but it still took a good 20 minutes to get our sandwiches. Going to Earl's instead next time!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's has amazing sandwiches. Where I work occasionally gets them for the workers and even though I am security they share with me. First time being in one of their shops and I am disappointed. They take forever, and I doubt they are cooking the turkey, making the stuffing and cranberry sauce from scratch. 20 minutes and still nothing. There is barely anyone inside either.

Update: I went up to cancel and get a refund because the final bus I could catch and not be late to work was fast approaching. Apparently when a higher up showed up my ticket got lost. They apologized l, refunded me and within a minute handed my sandwich for free. I suppose I'll give them another shot another day to see how an I store experience should be...but I'll give myself more than 1 hour just in case! ;)"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian sandwich I have had my entire time in Madison. It reminds me of the sandwiches I used to get in NYC!!  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!!  Reminds me of the sandwiches in NYC. Definitely better than the other sandwich shops!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with all the other Yelp reviews...tried the Bobbie and love it!  I'm from Dallas and wish there was one closer to home."}
{"text":"Bobby! Cole Turkey!!! Slawbie Joe!!!!!! 

Oh shit, you guys have no clue what I'm talking about if you've never been to Capriotti's. Their standard subs including homemade turkey and homemade roast beef are fantastic by themselves but their specialty sandwiches are what really elevates this place to epic status.

The Bobby is the standard Turkey Dinner sub including turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing. Everything seems homemade and delicious and the price for what you're eating is really hard to beat. The Cole Turkey and Slawbie(sp?) Joe both have a base of Russian dressian and a really yummy coleslaw, the only difference being that one is Turkey and one is Roast Beef. I wonder which is which? Hmmmm

Anything you order here will make your stomach happy so go nuts! Sadly, this location is run by young kids who basically get your order wrong one out of every 3 times so beware. Capriotti's as a whole gets 5 stars but I'll knock off half a star for the haphazard service."}
{"text":"The best meal I had after four days at Red Rock. Had the Bobby with sliced turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo. Fantastic and huge. The meat was flavorful and the stuffing moist and salty, the way I like it. Huge sandwich on a good roll and a great value."}
{"text":"The Capistrami is to die for.  I love this sandwich.  I hold the russian and add the hot pepper relish."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich chain. Everyone raves about the bobby and the Capistrami but I love their cheesesteaks. 3 stars for this specific location. The food is never consistent and my cheesesteaks are always under seasoned. My favorite location at red rock station would get 4-5 stars."}
{"text":"Must be new management, went to this location twice and food/service was great. My 5 year old is a picky eater and the girl noticed he wouldn't eat his sandwich so she made him a grilled cheese. Super nice people, guess my first trip was a fluke."}
{"text":"I used to order delivery from here every time I had a day off. Call today and it's a 30$ minimum and a 4$ charge. No way I'm gonna pay that and a tip"}
{"text":"Sometimes the wait is long due to only one employee being there but food has always been good"}
{"text":"I work on a local \"party bike\" that goes throughout Old Town. During one of my stops I called ahead and picked up my sandwich. I had to try this place as they boast a large sign outside that says \"Voted Greatest sandwich shop in America\", which I thought was a very bold statement. I had the \"Bobbie\". It was good, everything was fresh a delicious. But I cannot give my praises having only tried one sandwich. As for \"Greatest sandwich shop in America\", I don't know about that one. It was good, but didn't blow my taste buds away."}
{"text":"Great as usual. Ordered a 20\" Cheese steak, extra meat and cheese, mushrooms, onions & peppers. Fed 3 big guys and we all commented how awesome it was."}
{"text":"I have loved bobbies for 15 years plus! Today was the worst Bobbie ever! I opened my beautiful pink wrapping and what a disappointment! I can even explain ! What the heck happened? It looks like a peanut butter sandwich! Is it because I was getting a sandwich free? (Because of buying 9 sandwiches with app) Why isn't someone trained right? I didn't want to call the manager and complain because what's going to happen? Oh the next ones free?! No I don't want a free one! I wanted this one to be awesome! Ughhh well I will not be going to this Capriotti's ever again!! I hope someone from management sees this review! I hope y'all train you staff to make them the right way! Please"}
{"text":"If I could give this location a negative star I would!!! I just got off the phone with the Supervisor, and general manager and wow!! What a joke of management! My husband ordered on the Capriotti's app. He ordered a medium Bobbie cut in 1/3 and extra mayo, and guess what?!?! No extra mayo and not cut in 1/3. As to explained to the GM he (my husband) is sitting an his office where he doesn't have access to a knife and clearly no mayo! So I called to say hey the sandwich is wrong. Thinking I was going to hear \"maam come back and we'll remake it\" 
No not the case! First I get a supervisor which is so nasty you can tell she HATES her job or her Title and she says \"it's not on the receipt I'm looking at it and it doesn't say it\" I said ma'am my husband wrote it on the special instructions section. She again says \"I'm looking at your receipt and there is nothing on here\" I said what's the point of ordering on the app? If the order is still wrong? She says \"well the app doesn't work right that's all I can say\" Wait what? So I ask can I have your general managers name she says hold on. Then a man comes on the line and says this is David I'm the GM. So I explain everything to him again and he says yes that's right. I'm looking at the receipt and it doesn't say it, but when I look your order up on my email it does say cut1/3 and extra mayo. I said ok so why wasn't it done that way. He says \" I manage a lot of stores and special orders come in on my email and they don't have access to it\" I say \"ok well that's not helping customers like me\" he says well it's not on the receipt and the sandwich maker didn't see it so she didn't do that way. I said ok but that's not right. Well there's nothing I can do he says! Wait what again?!?! So then I ask ok can i have your corporate email or phone number he then says no it's private you can go on Yelp. They see it on there. Then he says and it's the first time I hear my supervisor is rude! What?! Your questioning me. Totally disappointed at the management here! I will NEVER go back to this location again! Even if i have to drive an extra 5-10 miles out of my way! We own a business on the west side of town and order trays and employee luncheons here! Well guess what? Never again! Capriotti's I hope you speak with your General Manager and supervisor because you might lose some good business right here!!"}
{"text":"Always good no matter what location you go to in town!! I get the chicken philly with sweet and hot peppers mom on!"}
{"text":"The steak and cheese footlong is delicious. Probably the best I've had in Las Vegas. This location seems to be better cooks then others. You can't go wrong if you like Philly cheers teaks."}
{"text":"When you are starving for a sammich you want capriottis! The food is real not like those corporate sandwich spots. I would say this is one of my top five favorite eateries of Sin City. 
 They have a grill so there is a hot and cold menu. They are vegetarian friendly both hot & cold options. I'm pretty sure the bread is made on site. The Turkey is really good. However, It's their specialty sandwiches that make this place remarkable. I love the Capastrami. It's more or less a Reuben on hero (grinder, sub, whatever you call it.) bread. My girlfriend likes the Bobbi (sp?) it's thanksgiving on a sub, complete with the cranberry sauce. 
 You can't not love this place!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of capriottis but noticed that at this location my sandwiches are often wet and soggy once I get them home. I live three minutes away. Recently though I got sick from a cheesesteak sandwich. I'm hoping it was just a one time thing but I don't have the stomach to try another one yet. It might take a while to get over that"}
{"text":"While it many not have the glitz of the rest of the Las Vegas strip from the outside, Capirotti's serves some of the best sandwiches around. It is unfortunate that the first reader did not have a good experience, because I have only had terrific experiences. Capirotti's serves several great sandwiches, but the highlight of this place is a sandwich called \"The Bobbie\", which is a Thanksgiving feast of turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing on a tasty sandwich roll. Other winners include \"Slaw Be Jo\" (roast beef, cole slaw, provolone, russian dressing, and mayo) and a tasty eggplant parmesan sandwich, which is one of many vegetarian choices. The only negative is that there are not a lot of places to sit, which can be a problem during the heart of the lunch rush. Service is friendly and prices run from about $6 for a small (9\") sandwich, to $11 for a huge (20\") sandwich which can be easily shared. I like to go with a few friends, get a few sandwiches and split them up. This is a regular stop for me when I am in town. Do yourself a favor and give Capriotti's a try."}
{"text":"Must always make a detour here every time!!

This location is open 24 hours

Make sure to come really hungry because not only do you get a huge sandwich, the Bobbie\" which is a turkey, stuffing, and cranberry style thanksgiving sandwich is super filling, you can split it with someone or save the other half for later. I thought is was going to be warm, but I received my sandwich to find that it was cold, which was surprising. It is still really good, but it would be better if they made it a warm sandwich.

the Capastrami.... pastrami, russian dressing, slaw & swiss cheese combined in sandwich is genius & greatness. The Italian hot sub us great as well. 

Great service, easy parking and convenient, definitely come back here every time."}
{"text":"I call in my order, they have it ready in 10mins.  Always always fantastic food and service!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I have ever been to Capriotti's Sandwich Shop but I will definitely come back. There were very very friendly and helpful. I ended up having the tuna sandwich on wheat with the spices and tomato and cheese it was wonderful!"}
{"text":"I don't know if this was just an off day but this was an overall bad experience. With no line, I was waiting at the register by myself for 15 minutes. Not an exaggeration; I counted. When i finally was acknowledged there was no explanation, just a 'can I have your order' don't care attitude. Not even the order was completed to the basic combo needs. No ice in the drink machine meant lukewarm beverages were being served. For a restaurant claiming to treat customers like family, this member won't be coming back for any reunions."}
{"text":"How can you not get a damn sandwich order wrong? Not just one but two. All I'm saying is it's not THAT hard to follow instructions. To the staff working Tuesday night, thanks for your rudeness and incompetence."}
{"text":"I love capriati's but this one is rough. Team doesn't like each other. I got bypassed in line to  order by someone that came in a 5 minutes after me. Food was just ok.....ordered finally placed at 6:38 received 7pm. I know better but I keep giving him chances because I love the product.Every time I come here I regret it...do yourself a favor drive to a different one."}
{"text":"This. Place. Is. DELICIOUS. Definitely a local secret that is gaining outside rep FAST. I wouldn't be able to choose between this place and Earl of Sandwich. Both really great tasting sandwiches, although I do believe this one is more bang for your buck. The 'Bobbie' sounds quite odd, but it definitely works and tastes freaking great. The cheese steak sandwich is pretty damn good, too! A little greasy, but the flavors were all wonderful.

The LARGE is really like an EXTRA-LARGE. A medium is like a foot-long you'd get at Subway. Definitely get the large!

Definitely coming back on any visits to LV. Recommend to all, LV locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"My sandwich was decent... Service was horrible though. The young man who 'eventually' helped me was very pleasant, however it took entirely too long to get helped.

Additionally, the company/business should really offer apron changes to it's employees.  Not one employee had a clean apron. I get that they get soiled, but I can't think of a restaurant where I've seen such 'unclean' appearing aprons."}
{"text":"This place came highly rated on yelp so I was excited to try it for myself. Read that I must try \"the Bobbie\" which is a turkey, stuffing, and cranberry style thanksgiving sandwich.  Received my sandwich only to find that it was cold and dry which was a surprise to me. It had an almost leftover feel which I would find acceptable only the following days after Thanksgiving. I went up to ask to have it run through they oven to heat it up only to be swiftly shot down with a \"we don't heat up The Bobbie....\"  

Next time I want a Thanksgivings style sandwich in Vegas Ill stick with Earls of Sandwich down the street.  Thanks for the disappointment Capriottis...."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after Red Rock Canyon and Bonnie Ranch. We were hungry and didn't know what to really eat so we stopped by here. They have an ok selection of different sandwiches I got the Bobbie which has real turkey, cranberries and stuffing w/ mayo was good this is also voted the best sandwich in America so I had to try it. I also tried the capastrami which was also good had pastrami, Cole slaw and cheese. Overall glad I was able to try this place."}
{"text":"Over a year ago I ate here and had three turkey bones in my Bobbie, was grossed out but understand that mistakes happen but didn't want to go back for awhile. Just decided to give them the chance again and piece of trash was in my food. Disgusting.. 2/2 times this place was just nasty. This place does not represent the company good at all. Never eating at this location again."}
{"text":"I know its a sandwich shop and your thinking who rates a sub?   I do!!!   I absolutely loved my yummy meal!  I had the Italian !  Bread was soft -- meat was thick and fresh & had just the right amount of veggies !

Be sure to ask for sweets & hots on the side as you cant ever have enough!  My friend had a turkey salad and there were chunks of fresh turkey meat on it!!   Not that icky processed meat!  

Staff were friendly and fast!"}
{"text":"While we realize this is Easter, we assumed the sandwiches ordered thru Uber-Eats, as this location was open, would be as usual. Nope. I'm under the weather and needed to feed the family. Uber driver was a gem and courteous. When we opened two of the four sandwiches we ordered UGH! No marinara on sausage sub and isn't a philly cheese steak suppose to have peppers and onions like when we order it at the counter? Nope. Also, order veggie burger. Not veggie cheese burger. Got molten cheese on this burger that we Cannot peel off. This location will not be visited by any of our giant family size members.  Unfortunatley. Wish I could get a few bucks back on this garbage to further too the driver."}
{"text":"Every sandwich I've had here is pretty legit. A way better alternative to subway without having to micro manage a subway artist. I always eat the sandwiches in 2 sessions because half a 16 inch does me right. I love the capastrami, the Italian dressing is addicting. I usually dislike cranberry sauce but on the Bob sandwich it compliments the stuffing perfectly. The Italian sandwich is on point. I should discover the whole spectra of sandwiches because up to date I have not been dissapointed. I don't add the drinks or chips cause I usually go to 711 and grab it there. 

The cons:
The dining area is a bit depressing. It's very bland and not very colorful. Luckily I live across the street so I take it home and enjoy my sandwich there."}
{"text":"Time I start writing on Yelp as have used it often since moving to Las Vegas last year. Had Capriotti's Italian wich on Paradise/Harmon a few months back and the same today @ E Sunset. The only similarity was the bread. Disappointing and won't be back. Tasted like retirement food may, which is a scary thought for the future. Only saving grace was nice staff though one was sitting @ table eating when we walked in."}
{"text":"I was in Downtown Scottsdale yesterday with my Niece and Great Nephew ( 6 months old), and after shopping, we stopped for lunch at Capriotti's Sandwich Shop. What an amazing surprise to have a sandwich there. My niece had their Homemade Meatball Sub and I ordered the Capastrami, with Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and cole slaw. My niece loved her sandwich and I am originally from New York and I have had some great Pastrami sandwiches before and I have to say, this was incredible. First we ordered the small, and that small was huge. The price was great and the service was just as good.. This is on my \"have to eat places\" when in Scottsdale, AZ. Thank you to the owners, staff and cooks and I can't wait to come back again!! :)"}
{"text":"Ugh.  I really want to give this place a great rating but it is so underwhelming.  It is so expensive and so average.  I want to like it because they have a decent meatball sandwich.  It is just decent.  It also wasn't very hot.  I mean honestly, I bought it right then and there, not ordered ahead.

That being said, it wasn't awful.  It was just ok."}
{"text":"Lately I've been going to eat to places that have 4-5 stars and everyone raves about them!! And just like when someone tells me that a movie is the best ever!!!!  my expectations are very high, I watch it and more often that not, I'm disappointed. 

I'm glad to say that Capriotti's didn't disappointed me at all! I had a Capistrami and it was delicious! Also, it was the smaller size (9inches) and it was huge! Big enough to share, but being that I was very hungry and I don't like to save a sandwich with coleslaw for later....well, I ate it all!  
I agree though with other reviews that mentioned the bread could be better. Luckily the great filling made up for the not as great bread.

Service was good and the guys behind the counter were very nice as well.

The price is fair since the sandwiches are huge. 

I'll definitely come back to try other sandwiches."}
{"text":"I have given this location plenty of chances. This was the last. I just waited for 30 minutes for a single sandwich. There was one order in front of me. There was one person making sandwiches and two girls outside smoking. Then, to top it off, the sandwich was gaunt with toppings. It was like eating a loaf of bread. So very unhappy."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is a very good sandwich place. It is located just off the strip, one block west on Sahara. They have very good sandwiches for a decent price. My friends and I decided to pick several sandwiches up and eat in the room since we wanted ample time to get ready for a big night clubbing. I even bought an extra one for a post drinking meal. I ordered:

Capastrami: A pastrami sandiwch served with cole slaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing. It was very good. The pastrami was lean and not too salty. It was very good.

The Bobbie: A turkey sandwich served with cranberry sauce and stuffing. It was delicious. 

The sandwiches here are great! It's a good place for a quick cheap meal in Las Vegas. You can easy take it back to your room. They serve comparable sandwiches to Earl of Sandwich in Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"I have eaten a Capriotti's a couple of times now. The sandwiches are very good. I have had the Bobbie and the Capastrami. Both are delicious. Capriotti's is a good cheap dining option while in Vegas. Even though it is a little off strip it is worth the drive. I enjoy picking up a sandwich each time I visit the Vegas area."}
{"text":"I've been here only a couple of times and every time my sandwich was delicious. I ordered the vegan \"chicken\" sandwhich and it was great. A good portion of the fake chicken and lots of veggies. I'm not actually vegan but I did noticed that they cooked my pieces of chicken on a clean portion of the grill. They sanitized it and everything which is fantastic if you're actually vegan."}
{"text":"THE BEST sandwich shop in town!!!!  If you get a cheesesteak, do yourself a favor, and ask for extra cheese.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop.  Get the Bobbi.  They actually roast entire turkey's overnight and carve it for the sandwich.  Add the sweet cranberry sauce with stuffing and it's an amazing turkey sandwich.  It's Thanksgiving in a sandwich everyday."}
{"text":"Not being from here I luckily found this place for lunch. They make a pretty good sandwich. I had a small ham and provolone. I finished it but the small sandwich was actually large enough for 2 people. Has was good too. 1000x better than Subway."}
{"text":"I was excited to see this Capriotti's location being built since it's one of my favorite places to stop and have lunch. This is the first stand-alone Capriotti's in town, so no strip-mall type scene here. It's in a small parking lot that's shared with Carl's Jr and conveniently located right across the street from Aliante aka Dinosaur Park which is a plus for those wanting to grab a sandwich before heading to the park. I was happy to be their very first customer the day they opened and to thank me for being first in line I was given any meal free! I've been eating at Capriotti's since they were a smaller business long before they were bought and then opened locations all over the country, so this free meal was well deserved and absolutely much appreciated! 

Small - 9 inches
Medium - 12 inches
Large - 20 inches 

Capastrami ($8.49 for the small) - Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw. I like several of the sandwiches on Cap's menu, but the Capastrami is my favorite. I have been to this location more than once since it opened and the sandwiches has been consistent. The coleslaw tasted fresh as well the bread that is baked by a local bakery here in town. 

I love the size of this Cap's it's spacious inside with plenty of seating and there is a bathroom. The ordering area is by far more spacious than any of the other locations currently in town and there is a sign that indicates where to pick up to-go orders so you don't have to wait in the regular ordering line. Outside they have specially marked parking for to-go customers. Another thing about outside is the dining area that is not only spacious, but dog friendly! I have eaten inside as well placed phone orders and the employees were courteous and polite and my order was ready when promised. I have been able to earn and redeem my CAPAddicts rewards here with no problem."}
{"text":"This Capriotti's is located inside the food court (where Lone Mountain Buffet used to be) inside Sante Fe Station. You can place a phone order or walk right up to the counter and order. There is plenty of tables with seating in the food court and the area is usually pretty clean. I have had both the Capastrami and Bobbie from this location several times and it's been constantly tasty. The employees are friendly and I like that they accept the rewards from their app as well coupons that come to my e-mail. Having the app gets you freebies like cookies, drinks and sandwich upgrades as well a free sandwich after purchasing so many. Make sure to check the bottom of your receipt they sometimes have discounts towards your next purchase. This is a decent place to grab a sandwich hot or cold.

Capastrami ($8.49 for a small) - Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw. This is definitely my favorite sandwich at Cap's. The coleslaw is made fresh daily and it just tastes good. I order it to-go often and it's still hot and delicious by the time i get home to eat it. 

The Bobbie ($7.59 for a small) - Homemade Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. It's like they took all the leftovers from Thanksgiving and put it between bread for the ultimate leftover Thanksgiving sandwich. The turkey is made fresh at each location and hand-pulled. I really liked how this last Thanksgiving they had the option to add a side of gravy, score! Where has this gravy been? Please bring the gravy back as a regular menu item because it pairs so nicely with The Bobbie! This is the perfect sandwich to pack for a picnic lunch, hike or to take with you to work for lunch because it holds up well. 

The bread for the Cap's locations here in Vegas and Henderson come locally from Great Buns Bakery and is delivered fresh to each location. 

Sizes are as follows and it's worth noting because to this day I see people ordering a large and then they get so surprised at how big it is:

Large - 20 inches
Medium - 12 inches
Small - 9 inches"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a cheap, filling lunch, you don't have to travel far - these no-frills sandwich shops are all over town. Best known for their beef and turkey, roasted right on the premises, they serve overstuffed sandwiches (a large will feed two easily) that put Subway to shame . . . and would turn Jared into a mini-Blimpie. They also feature Italian cold cuts, cheese steaks, meatball subs, and a few veggie varieties. Five stars for a sandwich shop? Yes, they're that good."}
{"text":"I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich that came with a piece of plastic in it that my husband choked on. I called them to let them know hoping it wouldn't happen to anyone else. They thanked me but didn't offer to replace or money back, if they'd have I'd give them 5 stars for doing the right thing."}
{"text":"The Bobbie.
Still way to big. A small is 9 inches? Really?
Still as delicious as ever.
Still one of my favorite sandwiches.

This location also sells bundtlets from Nothing Bundt Cake. Awesomeness covered in an even tastier icing. Love it!"}
{"text":"And on the 8th day, god created... the bobbie. That's how awesome it is. Awesome in its taste, awe-inspiring in its simplicity. Awe-inspiring awesomeness. Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo in a sub roll. So good I've had it three days in a row. 

My only complaint is that it takes a while to make their sandwiches, so it's best to call ahead if you can and pick it up. It would also be cool if you could substitute mashed potatoes and gravy for the stuffing."}
{"text":"I'm a Capriotti's fan. I eat at one 1-2 times a week. This is one location I love because not only is it tasty but it is near a Home Depot I frequent. 

The store is clean. The dining area isn't very big so I usually phone my order in and pick it up to go. During lunch hours this location is a mad house and can get cramped but obviously worth it!

I like that Capriotti's has been giving a $3 coupon on some receipts I get. Not sure how long it will last but as long as it is around I will be appreciative! Pay attention to your receipt you might have one on there. You do have to go to a website and fill out a brief survey but it is quick and worth the discount.

I'm a sucker for a \"Capastrami\". It has Pastrami, Swiss, Cole Slaw, and Russian Dressing on a hoagie roll. It is pure heaven with each bite.

They have a variety of sandwiches to choose from.

Should you be a fan of the \"tastykake\" brand they carry a variety of their snacks. The \"Wise\" brand chips are my fav.

Sandwich sizes are as follows:
-Small is 9 inches
-Medium is 12 inches
-Large is 20 inches"}
{"text":"Top notch location! Anybody who has lived here long enough and loves Capriotti's knows that this is a old school location. Who knew it would grow to be so big and have locations all over? I did! Well, I dreamed haha. It is nice to have a Caps nearby no matter what area of town I am working so I can grab lunch.

Always clean inside and the staff are very friendly. I usually call my order in for convenience.This location can be so busy.  The \"Capastrami\" is my fav. If you love pastrami, coleslaw, and thousand island dressing then this is the sandwich for you.
I love to stop by before heading to the nearby Doc Romeo park. The paper they wrap the sandwiches in carries well. My man tries the \"Cheese Steak\" and I sampled a bite. It isn't a true cheese steak and would go elsewhere for that type of sandwich. Good thing there is a variety of options. They have vegetarian options too!

The parking lot is sometimes cramped but who cares when you know you're going to eat one of these delicious gems?!?!"}
{"text":"The thanksgiving meal in a sandwich is actually very good, I would return and try the others next visit to  Las Vegas,.  The location is a couple of streets back from the strip ; I like to eat off strip as I tend to find many more food choices just a couple of blocks away."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good, but they obviously dont have enough staff on hand to handle all the customers on Saturdays. The tuna sub was good, and the meatball sub qas good....it just needs to be longer."}
{"text":"One of the few places I have stored in my phone. This particular location is open 24/7. If you already know what you want, I'd recommend calling it in, as they can get busy. As a vegetarian, I'd say their sandwiches are amazing. Veggie cheese steak is my favorite (take it to go and add Famous Dave's Devil Spit bbq sauce to it, trust me). The veggie cole turkey is awesome too, just tell them to go easy on the mayo, they drown it. The veggie burger sandwich is a garden burger patty, good if you like garden burgers. You can also order the bobbie with veggie turkey. It's worth the $2 more than the subway across the street, that's for sure. They also sell really good chips, I'd recommend the Walker's Honey BBQ. Writing this review makes me want to order a sandwich right now!!"}
{"text":"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I don't like to knock a business until I've had a bad experience more than once. This Capriotti's is the closest to me house so I've been here several times, and the last few experiences have been horrible.

I love the Bobbie and the Capastrami. The last time I ordered, my stomach was churning after eating the Capastrami. It tasted a little off but I ate it anyway. Boy did I regret it.

Whet really bugs me is their bad customer service. One time I walked in, and the girl just looked at me without a \"Hi\" or \"How may I help you?\" And they are just as rude over the phone. The staff really seem like they hate their job.

I still like Capriotti's but I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Got the 2 phillies then asked if i can get no peppers one and she huffed and puffed she didnt seem happy with me, my bad."}
{"text":"The thing that frustrates me the most about yelp reviews is you don't know the level of taste from the people who are reviewing. This place was gross. The pastrami, which was one of their signature sandwiches was terrible. Soggy bread. Too much sauce, of course to cover up the quality of the meat. If you're a true foodie don't waste your time.

I did want to mention, to those foodies in search of something special, there is an Asian market in the same mall that has an off the hook hot food bar with homemade egg rolls and incredible Asian delectables."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop...the food is always consistent.  You can order online and pick it up with no waiting as well.  
The Bobbie is my favorite but I have never had something here that wasn't good.  This location is clean, friendly, and reasonably priced.  They have fountain drinks or a variety of bottled juices."}
{"text":"True story: this place nearly killed me. As in, ended my life. I was in between day classes, and I was already exhausted from working my night job. I made my bi-weekly pilgrimage to the Maryland Pkwy location to get a Bobbie--

--It really is as good as you've heard. Its like thanksgiving every day, especially useful in a city that has no semblance of seasons...no fall leaves, no nippy Thanksgiving-type weather....the Bobbie is as close as you're gonna get to an authentic Thanksgiving experience in this God-Forsaken town.

Anyway. Got a Bobbie, the place was packed and I was in a hurry, ate it in my car. The sandwich was so good, I fell asleep in my car. In the 110 degree heat. Woke up ~20 minutes later, felt really sick, confused, and short of breath. I tried to stand up, promptly threw up, missed my afternoon class, and wasted a great sandwich.

It was the heat stroke that made me puke, btw...not the sandwich.

Highlights include THE BOBBIE, really excellent vegetarian options, and proximity to campus."}
{"text":"So yummy!!!! We order these amazing sandwiches a few times a month for work!! I would recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend anymore...we don't get the five star reviews..must be for future coupons or to enter drawings because the Cappriotti of old is gone.  We went on at lunchtime..used to be packed, there was one person in there.  This used to be a place we ate minimum once a week...I mean the Bobbie, Thanksgiving in a sub, how could you go wrong right?   Well I'll tell you how...
1. Use dry crusty turkey that tastes old and not much of it.
2. Put hardly any stuffing on it and make it so salty all you taste is salt.
3. Use a narrow bun, they used to be bigger, that is so  thick  you are mostly eating a bread sandwich.
The cranberry sauce is the only redeeming feature....and you need plenty of it to make up for the dried out bread sub.

We won't be back ...this visit cinched it.  $8 for mostly bread is a ripoff. 
You know it's bad when you can't wait to get home to brush your teeth from the bad after taste.
Highly disappointing."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were mangled, bread was wadded up and cut incorrectly, mayo was thrown into the sandwich to the point where it was dripping out the sandwich, just an overall poor quality sandwich.

Do yourself a favor and get a sandwich from the Flamingo and Sandhill location instead of from Nellis if using Grubhub."}
{"text":"Hmm. Capistrami. The Bobbie. Excellent choices."}
{"text":"Good stuff! The bread is always fresh and the turkey is always great. Has the feel of an old-school sandwich shop and you can tell that use only quality ingredients. There's good reason why they're so successful."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches EVER to enter my stomach! 'the bobbie' and 'capistrami' are the two best things I had. So damn good. 

The Bobbie is like thanksgiving between bread and the capistrami is so flavorful and delicious. 

A 20in sandwich only runs you $12 which is a super generous price. A 20in in both the Bobbie and capistrami would be good enough for breakfast lunch and dinner. 

I wish they would stay open later but it's okay.  They definitely need one in San Diego!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. These sandwiches are excellent. Usually you don't get stuff this good from franchised (fast food) places, but this really blew me away. The prices are a little bit higher than usual ($6.75 for 6', $8 for 12' and $13 for large [can't remember the length]), but not much and the quality more than makes up for it. For comparisons, think Jimmy John's (but better) more than Subway or Quiznos, since the quality is more like a deli than fast food. Finally, like others have said, their specialty is turkey (carved), though they do have other (delicious) options."}
{"text":"GOBBLE gobble GOBBLE...
Whenever I get that craving for leftover Thanksgiving dinner, my go to spot is Capriotti's!
I should probably preface this with:
I'm a COLD, leftover food kinda girl!
COLD pizza, COLD spaghetti, COLD anything really.......and the BOBBIE at Capriotti's tickles my fancy!
Thick slices of COLD roasted turkey, scoops of COLD stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo, fresh bread........MMMmmmMMM, the freakin' goodness!
=)
Yeah, I've tried other sandwiches they make (and they're GREAT too), but my motto is:
\"If it ain't broke, don't f**k with it!\""}
{"text":"Have been lazy on making your sub.  And don't make the subs like all the other ones do. They short you on everything."}
{"text":"Now I know there are multiple locations here in Vegas, but this one is the best!  I always order the philly cheesesteak with mushrooms and you have to get the hot peppers, I wanna know where they get them!  This location is clean, the staff are super friendly and their tip jar says beer money, love it! Went in today for my weekly fix and as always, the meat cooked well, love the fresh bread and of course the hot peppers.  The staff member who rang me up (he might be the owner) gave me a $3.00 off coupon for my next visit!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't come back.

This was my first time at Capriotti's and I am pretty disappointed because everyone tells me that it's the best sandwich they have ever had.. Me thinks not.

The cashier was completely ice cold towards me while I was ordering and only spoke to me wwwwwwheeeeeen: I finished ordering and gave her my card to swipe. When she handed it back and said nothing, I started walking away to sit down at a nearby table. Immediately, she raises her voice and says \"HEY! YOU HAVE TO SIGN THIS FIRST!\" Maybe it is because I have been in customer service for so long that something like this pisses me off, but that's not how you address customers. If it's a big deal, wait until the receipt is done printing, and THEN hand my card back at the same time saying \"Will you please sign that receipt for me as well?\" 

I ordered the Roast Beef without onion and added mayo. To my surprise, the roast beef was shredded.. I've never had it shredded before when I have ordered from other places? And the big bummer was that the roast beef was very very dry. The bread was okay, but it was on the colder side. I didn't know if I had the option for it to be toasted when I ordered or if it's served like this, but the cashier could have cared less. 

After my buddy ordered, he turned to me and said \"That girl was such a b%$* to me!\""}
{"text":"These guys are always on point. Cheese steak FTW every time. Best cheese I've had in Phoenix, so far..."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin I been coming here for a long time. 8 years at least? It's been almost that long. This location has never been a disappointment and my go spot in this area."}
{"text":"This place makes the best subs in Scottsdale. I especially enjoy their \"Bobbi\" sandwich, this bad boy is loaded with everything you enjoy at your Thanksgiving feast. Shop is very well kept and stocked with friendly personnel. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"By far the greatest sandwich I've had for the price! The meats are fresh and have a rich flavor, the coleslaw is made fresh daily and adds the perfect texture and flavor to every bite! If you have yet to experience Capriotti's you are missing out! You have gained my business for life. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"If I could give this 0 stars I would. We ordered our food at 7:45, for pick up was told it would be ready in 20 minutes. Got there at 8pm. Wait over 30 minutes still no food. The reason we were told it wasn't ready was that they cook other people's food who walk in first. Great, so what's the point of ordering early? This whole experience ruined a family movie night at the drive in. We don't even live near this area so our total night was complete ruined. My suggestion, if a customer calls ahead for their food they expect it in the time frame you promised it to be ready."}
{"text":"I had the Bobbi and my wife had the Pastrami. Both we absolutely amazing and I would recommend both to anyone."}
{"text":"The Capastrami was amazing. Probably the best submarine I had ever eaten in my life. Seriously. I came back the next day & got the Boobie. Not impressed with that one. Too much dry stuffing. They should use mashed potatoes & gravy instead of stuffing. 
  Lil side story. The chick taking the order starts flirting from the second I walk in. She tells me shes getting off in 5min & she'll b at the bar next door. I tell her I got a show to go to but got her #. She wanted to \"hang\", but had to find a baby sitter. She was way older than me & looked like an alchy. Lol \"They're all whores\"!"}
{"text":"The staff is GREAT the food is always hot and delicious, I have NEVER had a bad sandwich here.  Strongly recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"A couple of the guy employees who have worked there at least 3 months are great.  I'm not saying any current new employees are not nice, they just can't get an order right to save their life.  It's the only location I'm aware of that puts their marinara sauce away an hour before closing too.  

I understand some people are new to the job but, when you repeat the simple order back to me and then still forget the most important ingredient, come on now.  After the 3rd dry sandwich and a very unhappy bf because dinner is ruined again, it's time to speak up."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time last week and it was awesome! The worker explained what was popular and what he liked well and seemed knowledgeable of the menu. The capastrami was super yummy!"}
{"text":"Maybe I am missing something but I just didn't find anything special about my sandwich.  Maybe I was expecting more because of all the positive reviews at other locations.  Store was clean and staff was friendly but the sandwich itself was just a notch above a Quizno's or Subway.  I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I love this place I always order and go pick it up. Ashley is one of the best employees they have, she is super nice and very prompt on the phone. and the food is of course delicious that's why I keep ordering."}
{"text":"We showed up 90 minutes before close and ordered some sandwiches and soup. They told us that no one had changed the soup since morning and wouldn't serve it to us. Which is fine. It then took them 20 mins to make 4 sandwiches...and when we went to leave 30 minutes before close we discovered that they had turned off the soda machine. They were \"pre-closed\"... 
It was more than a little frustrating to see the way  these people were ambivalent towards us. I will never return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is OMG amazing, Subway or any other sandwich shop watch out!! Perfectly priced, generous portions and amazing quality"}
{"text":"This lovely place I discovered in Las Vegas when I lived there.  (The one in vegas is on Alta between Rainbow and Buffalo near sushi on summerlin, but I've heard it's moved since then.)

I would have given this 5 stars, but I have found that their roast beef sandwich leaves a little to be desired -- mostly because it's like shredded roast beef, so it's a bit bland and extremely dry.

That aside, everything else just flies into the hearty flavorful sandwich realm.

I would recommend the Mushroom Cheese Steak, Grilled Italian or Meatball sandwich.

Their specials Capastrami (hot pastrami, cole slaw, swiss cheese and russian dressing) and The \"Bobbie\" (turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing and mayo) are something to get all hot and bothered over.

Capriotti's also has Vegetarian Sandwiches -- soy Turkey, Balogna, Salami and burgers -- if you are not a meat eating kind of person.

Overall, I love Capriotti's, but am happy they are quite a ways away.  I'd eat there at least 3 times a week if they were closer."}
{"text":"It's your basic Capriottis but the closet to where I live. I need my sandwich fix once in a while and they are reliable. The staff is friendly and get your order out quickly.  A big let down is that they don't carry Tastycakes anymore..Thumbs Down to that but I can get them at another place if I really wanted one."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Santa Fe Station food court, Capriotti's seemed like the best choice of all the food options there. I usually go back and forth between the Bobbie and the Capistrami, and this time, I wanted a hot sandwich so I got a Capistrami before going to the movies. The combination and contrast of the hot pastrami combined with the cold slaw and russian dressing makes this an addicting sandwich that you take one bite after another until there is no more!

I ended up sneaking the other half of my sandwich in because we weren't keeping track of time and didn't wanna end up with junk seats, That was a great sandwich, and I prefer that any day over a bucket of outrageously priced popcorn with that fake butter...ALOHA!!!

{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(240/365) \"Try The Italian!\"

I've always been a fan of the Bobbie and Capistrami and it's hard two deviate from the two, but on this recent visit ,The Italian sandwich caught my attention. This bad boy was filled with assorted cold cuts, cheeses, lettuce, tomatoes, peppers, THE WORKS!

The staff is always nice and courteous, and this location is pretty close to us, so that's a plus. The portions are HUGE too, so order according to your hunger, or if you plan to have more for another meal.

Wise Chips are sold here too which is a perfect accompaniment to your sammie...\"crunchify\" it by stuffing the chips in your sandwich...SO GOOD!  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"I love Capriotti's. One of the first things I did when I moved back to Vegas was go to the one on Craig and the Capastrami was delicious. Then I moved to Henderson and started frequenting the one off of Eastern in the Goodwill shopping center. Like any other Capriotti's I've had their sandwiches were delicious. Then there's this one which is less than a mile from my home. I ordered the Capastrami and my wife went to pick it up. When she came back the sandwich was small and there was barely any pastrami or eve slaw in it. Not to mention, there was about half the sandwich that was just bread and it was cold. I was extremely disappointed and I think from here on out I'll go out of my way to eat at the one by Goodwill."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(204/365)  \"Super Sammies!\"

 I've always been a fan of Capriotti's, and when Mom and Pops was in town recently, rather than take them for their usual In-N-Out fix, (In-n-Out doesn't exist in Hawaii) We decided to check out Capriottis, since they have bomb sandwiches and is another business that isn't available in Hawaii.

We ordered a small Bobbie and a small Capistrami, my two favorites. We looked around to see what Pops wanted, and knowing him, he had to have his rice fix, so he ducked out and went to nearby Panda Express. Mom was surprised to see the size of the sandwiches, so I guess it was a good thing I didn't order footlongs!

Pops had a little taste and he liked both sandwiches and Mom was enjoying it as well. They both liked the fact that there was real turkey in the Bobbie and the great taste of the Capistrami as well. Now they have another food option for their next visit besides In-N-Out or a buffet!  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(336/365) \"Sensational Sammies!\"

Usually go for the Capistrami and The Bobbie any time I hit up Capriotti's, but this time
I just wanted something small, so instead I went for their Cran-Slam-Club. The workers were very nice and helpful, and had no problem with our request of having the bread extra toasted.

Loaded with turkey,cranberry, ham, cheese, lettuce, and tomatoes...kinda sorta like a lighter version of the Bobbie, and not as filling. That was good, and it totally hit the spot!
Of course, no Capriotti's sandwich is complete with some Wise Salt & Vinegar chips, right?

I keep hearing good things about their Grilled Italian to try that one too! So awesome that we have a location in our neck of the woods!  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Mediocre sandwiches, lame service, dirty restaurant. 

It is hard enough as it is to find parking and get a decent table in an Old Town restaurant. I stopped in here because they didn't seem to busy and a cold sandwich sounded good. When I walked in I was the 3rd person in line and the gal taking orders started to get anxious with the older gentleman ordering. By the time I got to the counter there was about 4 people behind me. She was still very nice taking my order but very rushed. 

About 10-15 mins after placing my order the rude guy making the sandwiches yelled my name and basically tossed my sandwich tray on the counter in my general direction. Uhhhh...rude. 

The seating area itself was cramped for space (which is fine) but the tables were all sticky and had garbage littered all over the place. After seeing that I was turned off at the idea of eating there. I went back up to Mr. Sandwich thrower and asked for a to-go bag. He rolled his eyes at me and handed me a brown bag. Wow. I am so sorry to inconvenience you, jerk face.

I won't be back. Ill just go to a Subway. At least they serve a crap sandwich with a smile and hold the attitude!"}
{"text":"I normally go to this location to get my subs but this time I was highly disappointed. I ordered capastrami sub and it tasted like another sub... It's looked like they didn't clean the grill before making my sub and it tastes like a philly cheese steak... I called the manager and all he said was he will check his food... Not once did he apologize or willing to accommodate us... Wasn't calling to get money or anything but it's always nice to offer it... That being said we won't be going back to this location ."}
{"text":"This Capriotti's is inside the Regional Justice Center, the local state court. It's a good place to meet people and talk and plan.  The workers are top notch.  They do their best to tailor the menu to your needs.  I like the salads best.  It gets busy during lunch, and they close at 3pm."}
{"text":"Wow~!~ They have the most wonderful sandwiches. The Bobbie is incredible and I highly recommend that you give Capriotti's a try~!~!~"}
{"text":"Visiting from Illinois, stopped here for a quick sandwich. Split the 12 inch turkey Cole...absolutely delicious! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Turkey is prepared each morning. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's! I used to go to them a lot in Vegas when I lived there. Then I saw a coming soon sign for them and all most crashed my car rubber necking to make sure I wasn't seeing things. After not having any for almost 2 years I was so excited to walk-in to a Capriotti's. I was not disappointed!

The food is great and I highly recommend the Bobbie or the Capastrami!!

Only down side is there a bit pricey. In the end it's worth it and I'm very happy I don't have to drive 4.5 hours anymore to get a specialty sub."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Not only were the sandwiches great, but the service is even better! I had ordered delivery through Postmates and as we waited, 4 AM is when we found out we won't be getting it anymore. We called the shop and explained it to them. They remembered our order and it was ready when we picked it up. The service was great, helpful and fixed the other company's mess up. I got the turkey sandwich and I would get it again! Thanks for saving the night you guys!"}
{"text":"I normally love Capriotti's sandwiches, until I went to this location..... The Chicken Phillys are amazing, usually.....I received the smallest amount of meat ever in my sandwich, EVER!!!!!!! Del Taco puts more meat in their .39 tacos than they did here! I've never had this problem with any of the other Capriotti's  around town. Very disappointing. I'll just visit another location and drive a little further. Maybe having stoners running your business isn't the greatest idea."}
{"text":"Worst experience!!! Took almost 30 minutes to get my sandwich and I was the only Customer in there!!
Didn't have enough time to eat because I was on my lunch break and had to go back! Thanks for the horrible lunch I had today."}
{"text":"I normally love everything I get at Capriotti's but today I am very disappointed.  I got a small Bobbie and three bites into it I got a large bone.  A one inch long bone that appears to be a piece of backbone.  This ruined my sandwich for me.  I can't believe such a large bone would not be noticed as they were preparing the turkey and putting it on a sandwich."}
{"text":"On our way to the Strip in Las Vegas, we stopped at Del Taco for tacos.  Upon seeing the amount of people inside this sandwich place, we immediately changed our minds. I ordered the hot Italian Sub and it was AMAZING. It was the best sandwich I have ever had. It was delicious, the idea was cool, and the sandwich was loaded with meats. The sandwich was freshly made and grilled to perfection. 10/10 and if I lived in Nevada, I would come here multiple times a week,"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place and think it's the closest thing to a Philly Cheese Steak in Las Vegas that your going to get.  Not on the Philly level but not too far off."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were average tasting to me, nothing that great about their sandwiches that another sandwich place can't make. Regular bread, regular toppings, and regular meats makes you a regular sandwich. They however do have some interesting items; \"The Bobbie\" : turkey meat, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and gravy? It's like Thanksgiving in a sandwich; it looked nasty and tasted the same."}
{"text":"Yum, the goodies in my Bobbie are falling out all over the place.  My BFF introduced me to this place years ago and I have told a lot of people about this place since then and made them all a fan.

Whenever I'm in town, I always go to Capriotti's.  I don't even bother with the one around my area.  They are stingy on the goodies and I consider Capriottis a Vegas treat."}
{"text":"Since I've been seeing signs claiming that Capriotti's was voted \"the world's greatest sandwich\" I decided to give it a try.  I decided to order an Italian sandwich.  First of all, I was a little sticker shocked...they don't have a combo meal so a medium sandwich, drink and chips came out to about $12.00--yowzers!  Secondly, I was the only customer for a good 10 minutes (it was 5pm on a Thursday) and my sandwich took FOREVER to get done.. maybe I'm use to Jimmy Johns and Subway.  I got mine to go and was very disappointed to find out when I got home that they gave me the WRONG sandwich.  How do you f-up an order when it's the only customer in the restaurant?  I even double checked my receipt to make sure I ordered the one I wanted.  Instead of an Italian I got some leftover Thanksgiving ensemble.  Well, this Yelper only eats stuffing on Thanksgiving and doesn't eat cranberry sauce or mayo at all.. I was so irate I gave the entire thing to my dog..hopefully he won't get sick."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop here for a sandwich to bring with us to Red Rock Canyon and Yelp did not disappoint. This is not your regular sandwich shop :p Definitely exceeded my expectation!

[SLAW BE JO] - $9.29 (12\") - Perfect for sharing between the 2 of us. The roast beef, Russian dressing and cole slaw complemented one another perfectly (can probably do without the mayo). It wasn't too heavy and was actually quite refreshing! RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Today i went in the workers were very nice i ordered the capstrami omg so good i will be back tomorrow for another 1st time at this location its pretty small inside but other then that the subs were great thank you for great service"}
{"text":"Maybe this was an off day for them. The garbage can was open, no bag, eating area not kept, table we sat at rocked like drinks sliding, table next to us not as bad, they forgot to make hot sandwiches, extra waiting, sloppy product, staff unhappy withdrawn attitudes.
This is not my normal location so... 
Lol, I love cappriottis and normally would say 5 stars. This place needs help...like now.
ATTN owners: Get involved...be leaders."}
{"text":"Meat was very salty & was poor quality..was excited to try it but very disappointed.  I went with my wife and friend and we all love subs and have tried many and we all felt that it was ok!  The bread wasn't that great either..It seems like the other locations have better reviews but nonetheless, its still the same meats and bread.  I would rather go to Jimmy Johns, Jersey Mikes or Hangover Hoagies."}
{"text":"I had a very nice experience from a warm greeting from Chase and Emily to delicious food and even with my weird request they handled me professionally without giving an attitude.  Yummy"}
{"text":"Very slow service. Everything is made fresh to order but for some reason this location takes a lot longer than others.  The Capastrami sandwich is my favorite.  It has grilled pastrami, coleslaw, melted Swiss cheese and Russian dressing. The food is fantastic but like I said the service at this location is subpar."}
{"text":"2 stars for a good tasting sandwich but shady sizing. I think this may be a test store for scamming customers in to paying the same for less sandwich. I've eaten at a lot of Capriotti's over the years and I ordered my usual here. Got a capistrami and a roast beef. Prices were still pretty expensive for a sandwich but I always pay since it's a good size and delicious. They handed me the bag and it felt incredibly light but I walked out with them anyway. I get home and unwrap them and notice that this particular store switched bread from the old French bread to like some kind of super narrow baguette bread. I was pretty mad as the prices were still the same but I got like half the amount of food. Its very clever since it's technically still 9\" but it is half as wide. Still pretty hungry and not very happy. Would not order from this store again."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good, the bread was soft and I received a generous amount of meat. I just wish they were friendlier about letting my young daughter use their restroom, as they dont have a public restroom they turned her away for that I wont be back."}
{"text":"I am from New Castle, Delaware which is where Capriottis originated. I was so excited when my sister in law told me Capriottis was coming to AZ. 
What a let down. The sandwiches have barely enough meat to even qualify as a sandwich. The chefs and owners have obviously never had a true cheese steak from the east coast"}
{"text":"The guys that work here are really friendly. I can only judge the food by the same sandwich I get every single time. The Capistrami with hot peppers. The sandwich is DOPE. I don't need anything else."}
{"text":"Don't bother calling.  The guy who said they are \"on time and target\" must have an extremely slow watch.   They don't start your sandwich till you get there no matter how busy they are.  They always seem to be confused as to what's going on.  I'm not a Capriotti's owner but I would think it would be wise to at least have 1 person in charge instead of three try hards. 

I guess the best deal.. I'f you could even call it that would be a large sandwich a bag of chips and a soda to split with someone.   But even then it's going to set you back almost 21 bucks. 

Splitting is still expensive"}
{"text":"The intelligent folks at this establishment put turkey meat on a vegetarian Bobbie sandwich. They'll also refuse to make you a new sandwich and won't refund the sandwich that they made improperly."}
{"text":"I work and live within a mile of this place for the past 2 years and near walk in until recently and now I can't stay out. They have a large selection and I plan to make my way thru them but I can say the Cheese Steak is great! The Homemade Tuna is good, The fresh Turkey  is good as well. I am Moving from area but will continue to visit for lunch while at work."}
{"text":"Great standby sandwich shop
Hot sandwiches make me a fan
Very no-frills, fair prices reflect that.
Bread, meats, and cole slaw was all tasty
I'll be back"}
{"text":"I've always loved the food here but today when me and my sister went to get a sandwich are service was very very slow. On top of that not one person in there had a hair net while making my sandwich which I find kind of gross."}
{"text":"best sandwiches this side of the mississippi!!!capastrami#1
beef phillycheesesteak#1
all sammis are loaded with meat
unlike jj's"}
{"text":"Not the greatest capriotti's out there. It's usually a few unmotivated younger employee's working in there. They're nice but they could use some customer service training.

I asked what options there were to add to the sandwich and the response i received was \"well what do you want on it?\"  I ended up just going to the 'order online' feature on my phone and listing the things i wanted from there. they also never have avocado so i'm glad i never order it online because i can only imagine i would get home with no avocado without being told ahead of time.

The girl at the register returned from the back to a lobby of us all in there waiting for sandwiches to be made yelling, \"does anyone want to pay down here?\" My immediate thought was, \"uhm no.\" haha I wasn't thrilled about the service as usual and my 20\" sandwich was mostly bread and very little filling (especially considering i added like every topping they offer). That sandwich cost me $15 and i didn't even add anything extra cost to it. 

The sahara and las vegas blvd location is by far better and a great example of what capriotti's sandwich shops are! I went because it's closest cappriottis to my house but i'll go down the street to jimmy johns from hereon out.  

*Also there are only 4 stools to sit at for dine in."}
{"text":"If you are looking to have a Thanksgiving meal everyday Capriotti's the place for you.  They have an awesome sandwich called \"the Bobby\".  It has turkey, dressing and cranberry all rolled into a sandwich. Once you eat this yummy meal you will have to take a nap.

  Capriotti's offers a lot of different sandwiches. This place has won many awards for their food.  The employees are always very nice plus they offer catering for parties or Football game days."}
{"text":"Hawaii doesn't have and REALLY NEEDS a sandwich shop like this one.

The Must-SAMPS sammiches:
1. The \"Capastrami\" is to d-i-e. I love pastrami and this only indulges my love for it even more.
2. The \"Bobbie\" is sweet and salty in one. I'm not a fan of turkey, cranberry, or stuffing during Thanksgiving but, I could mos def eat this all Thanksgiving night!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place, being a vegetarian it's not often I get many options. This place has 2 veggi turkey sandwiches and even a veggi philly cheese steak option. Honestly I have only gotten the veggi turkey since it's so good but I look forward to trying the other options."}
{"text":"Get The Bobbie. Even if you don't like pastrami, try the Capistrami; it's amazing."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is one of my favorite sandwich shops in Vegas.  Reminds me of the hoagie spot back east.  The sandwiches are huge filled with meat and toppings  I love the cheesesteaks and the italian!  This place is a definite must if you like a good sandwich!"}
{"text":"Great service w a smile!

Always order the WW Homemade Turkey!

Lurve it!

your constant companion,

~deirdra"}
{"text":"Capriotti's has never let me down once.  I always roll in to order, and the service is fast, efficient, and very friendly.  I love the fact that they have vegetarian meats to cater the non-meat eaters like myself, and even give the option for sandwiches even bigger than a footlong (unlike that other place where Jared eats at...) for those extra-hungry days!  The vegetarian turkey is my go to sub and the sandwich alone is usually enough to satiate my hunger.  Occasionally, I hit up the Vegetarian Cheeseburger sub or the Veggie Philly Cheesesteak if I'm in the mood for meat-like goodness.  Aside from the sub, Capriotti's offers a wide array of kettle-cooked potato chips (my favorite I might add), diversely flavored potato chips, and, to my surprise, bundt cakes.  The prices are a bit spendy, in comparison to other sub shops, but well worth it because the veggie meats are expensive to begin with in the first place.

Good food, good service, and I always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Fast and fresh but they always get my name wrong!  ...yet as soon as I bite into my sandwich, I instantly forget name issues and just can't stop grubbin'!  Anyway, the staff here are nice and always accommodating.  My fav is the vegetarian turkey and I make sure to get everything on it?  When I'm not in the mood for something traditional, I step my game up and get a vegetarian philly cheesesteak with all the good stuff on it.  The cheesesteak is pretty oily so I don't usually default to this option.  However, when I'm in the mood, the cheesesteak pulls right through and satisfies for sure.

Definitely a lunch spot I frequent quite a bit.. always coming back.  Thanks Capriotti's!

PS: BEER MONEY GUYS! WHOOOOOO!! -- be sure to tip and they'll be sure to hit you with that jingle.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Totally underwhelming, tried it twice. They are in the same category as run of the mill sub shops like subway or cousins in my opinion. Same basic bread. If you are starving and want some food, fine, but do not make a special trip. Sign says \"voted best sandwich in the world\" makes me wonder - by who? People without taste buds? I was disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the meatball sub I loved it, next month when I get my Social Security check I am going to get a 20 inch meatball sub I will give it all stars 10 Stars, I love meatball subs the best, then Like Italian Sausage Subs, then I like a Phillie cheese steak sum then a Pastrami sub, & the list goes on.this place is the Best, how I found out about your sub shop I asked a Fireman the other night up on Fremont at by Denny's I said to him who makes the best subs around & he told me it was called\" Capriotti's & I want to Thank that Fireman who told me about this wonderful sub place.

{"text":"How can you go wrong with Capriottis? My main problem is what to order -- the pastrami? The cheesesteak with hot peppers and onions? They now have 20 inch sandwiches at this location. I guess you should bring a friend and so you can split 2 different kinds sandwiches"}
{"text":"This place is a place I would tell you to stay away,
First they only serve one type of bread . second while I am eating,the employees give permission to a beggar hum goes from table to table asking for money with a cup while customers are eating,and last the bathroom was disgusting,no paper towels filthy sink and seat and floor"}
{"text":"No matter the location, Capriotti's is by far the best sandwich shop in Las Vegas. The only downside is that they are not open very late and some locations actually close at 3pm... It isn't convenient when you are in the mood for one of their sandwiches at like 6pm for dinner. The Bobbie is to DIE for. Their hot sandwiches are the best. Everything is fresh. And the best part, it isn't expensive. Been going here for 13 years and I cannot say I have ever been disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops in Vegas.  Love the cheesesteaks, the Bobbie, and the Capastrami. I have never had anything here I didn't like.  I've been to several locations.  This location is in the food court at GVR.  I work next door so it's convenient.  If your dropping in just to eat, park on the top floor of the north parking garage.  Entrance goes right to food court."}
{"text":"Apparently the posted 1am close time is incorrect. I tried to order food at 12:25am and was told the grill was shut down already. On a Friday night....really? I would have not made the drive all the way here if I'd have known this was the case."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the deal....  It's so difficult to choose!!!!  My husband is attached to their Philly Cheesesteak with the works, pile on the mushrooms, green peppers and onions. I'm torn between the Capistrami and their Turkey sandwich with stuffing and cranberry. The best part is they deliver too. It's good for 2days meal, always always have leftovers"}
{"text":"I go to capriotis probably once a week for lunch. Apparently this place roasts their own turkeys in shop so I recommend sticking with any turkey options, also order the \"Bobbie\" sandwich. It is Thanksgiving on a roll and will not disappoint."}
{"text":"How the HECK? I honestly thought that I wrote about this place months back (July 8th). Anyway, CAPRIOTTI'S is the BEST sandwich shop in the universe. I'm being dramatic and yes...I'm exaggerating, but that is TRUE! I love their SUB SANDWICHES! Especially the Bobbi! OH, BOBBI! ::drools like Homer Simpson:: 

I also ordered the other subs, but the BOBBI is the one that stands out above the rest. I love the sauce, I love the cabbage, I love the meat, I love it ALL! I was so sad when I had to leave VEGAS and travel back home to LA, but guess what.....a week after my BREAK-UP from the LV Capriotti's, I found one \"GRAND OPENING\" of a Capriotti's in MY AREA! Commence song!: \"REunnnnnnnnited and it feeelsssss so GOOD!\"

Immediately, I drove in and bought BOBBI back into my life. I was so happy that I HAD to share this with the FAMILY. I bought it for friends, and they FELL IN LOVE with it, and now....my Family-Family will experience the same! 

FYI, the one closest to me is in Azusa-Covina area, next to the Chuck-E-Cheese towards Azusa Pacific University!"}
{"text":"Classic flavor and exactly what I was expecting. As someone who originally hails from Delaware, I was raised eating Capriotti's sandwiches. For those of you who don't know, they were created in the First State. My go to is the Cole Turkey, which is their house roasted turkey, cole slaw, provolone cheese, and Russian dressing (I omit the mayo). The sandwich is always dependably delicious. It has the  right balance of flavors and textures. I'd say one of the highlights is the bread and it has a crusty yet chewy texture. A small is the right size for me and runs roughly $7 - my husband gets a medium typically. If you're looking for a good sandwich at a good price, definitely check out Capriotti's."}
{"text":"Food was made properly and was prepared quick! Devin gave excellent service and had a cool name!"}
{"text":"If only profanity was allowed to be expressed in yelp... Called for carry out and was put on hold.. I waited about 12 min then someone hanged up the phone.  Screw it I would rather drive the extra 1.5 miles or hell even 3 miles to another location to have better service."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches! I got the 6 inch turkey and had a hard time finishing it because it was so packed full of meat. Definitely worth dropping by this place for lunch."}
{"text":"I just had the Bobbie, billed as the best sandwich in America. The medium version was everything i expected, stuffed full of homemade turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo. The service was super fast and the girl working at the counter was super cute. All in all, Capriotti's was awesome and i'll definitely go back later this week before I leave Vegas."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the pastrami sandwich as well as the cheese and steak, but the place could use a little more TLC, does not look very clean."}
{"text":"I went into capriottis and ordered a cheese steak.  I'm an EMT for an ambulance company and I was on call. My two partners got there sandwiches within 10 mins. I went to go check on my order and the cashier said it was on the grill. I waited another 15 mins. Then asked the manager about my order again and said it was never made. I ended up waiting almost 30 mins for a cheese steak. Both of my partners finished their sandwiches and we got a call. I got my sandwich and all the manager said was \"Sorry\" and Walked away."}
{"text":"Have been here several times. Staff is very friendly and food is amazing. Only complaint I have is the past few times I've gotten anything with turkey I've had a few bone fragments"}
{"text":"*WARNING* DON'T\"T BOTHER TRYING THIS PLACE!!!!  *WARNING*

How this place has an average 3 star rating is quite beyond me. The no-star option is not available, otherwise they certainly would have earned it.

Unfortunately this review will have nothing to do with the food. On a recent trip home from Vegas we stopped here before the drive out. Ordered our food quickly and went and had a seat. 10 minutes go by and nothing. 15 minutes go by and nothing. 20 minutes go... You get the point. At this time we start seriously considering leaving, but give it another couple minutes. One of the starving travelers gets up and checks the grill. OUR FOOD ISN'T EVEN ON THE GRILL!!!!!! 

By now we are all fed up and we walk out. As we are leaving we can see two of our items just put down on the grill. I felt a little bad doing this, but it had already been 25 minutes, and there was zero communication from the staff. A poor couple (they didn't look financially destitute, just poor in their state of being) who was waiting when we walked in still had not received their entire order.

We went to the Burger King in the same complex, and guess what? They got my order wrong. Karma?"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place but on several occasions I have called ahead of time for an order only to be waiting longer then people who came in after me or even phoned in after me. Today I came in and when I went to pay 10 minutes after calling, they hadn't even started making my order. While I waited 3 to 4 people who came in after me had gotten their orders before me. To top it off, they called out the wrong name when it was done which added an additional few minutes until someone else shouted out my correct name. Good food but what's the point of the call in service if I'm waiting the same amount or even longer?"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for this place and I work relatively close so I figured I would try it out.  The cashier was not very friendly, the meat was dry and the veggies were limp.  All in all, just not a very positive experience."}
{"text":"I see capriotti all the time in San Diego so we decided to stop for the First time while visiting Vegas. I had a hot pastrami with American cheese  no slaw and Russian dressing on the side! It was soooo good!! I tasted the Russian dressing AKA thousand island. and it was tasty so I added a lil onto my sandwich! My son and hubby had turkey sandwich which were gross! Meat is real slice turkey not from deli and had no taste at all and into chunky pieces they did not eat their sandwiches. So we all shared mine lol :-( over all I will be back and get the pastrami. The manager was so nice he made us feel welcome I would love to return to this location just because of him! Very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I'd consider myself a \"regular\" at this point, and each & every time, I'm greeted with a smile & fast service. I hate myself for forgetting her name right now, but one extra SHOUT-OUT to the lovely lady always rocking the long braid.

*** Friends & family, take note: When I die, y'all better bury me with a Capastrami (w/ pepper relish) or I'll come back & haunt all your asses."}
{"text":"Most Capriotti's get a 3-3.5 stars from me. This one while the sandwiches are just as good as the rest of them gets a 2 star rating from me for one reason and that is the service. 

The staff wasn't very friendly and acted like we were bothering them if we needed anything that they weren't getting tipped for."}
{"text":"We had lunch here and I must say that after just a single visit this is one of the best three Sandwich shop's that I have ever been to. The other two are truly legendary so they don't count against this one. Bar none this is the best chain sandwich I have EVER had. The grilled Italian was just excellent, if you are in the LV area I recommend to go here. It isn't that much more than Subway or Quiznos and it is MUCH better than either, actually I think it is cheaper than Quiznos."}
{"text":"Best sub sandwiches in Madison, hands down. I visit once a week, they have a delicious vegetarian Sub with fake turkey that is fantastic, even the small size is filling enough for two meals. I like to get it with crushed peppers on the side & mayo, I haven't had a chance to try anything else yet because the love affair with my first option from them."}
{"text":"OMG! I was in Vegas during the fight weekend. I wanted to find a great philly steak place so I did my Yelp thang. A whole list of places popped up. But I was closet to Capriotti's so I stopped in ordered the Steak and Cheese with hot and sweet peppers and damn this place did not disappoint. That sandwich hit a 5 star homerun. It was so good, I brought one the next day on my way home."}
{"text":"Capriotti's makes the best damn sandwiches. Bobbi, Italian, or Philly FTW. 

This location is setup a little different than others with their counter but I've never had a problem with service."}
{"text":"Love the Bobbie!  Turkey, stuffing, cranberry and mayo.  So good!  The cheesesteak with grilled onions, red peppers and white American Cheese is also a favorite of mine.  The fresh baked rolls are perfect."}
{"text":"I was driving around looking for a parking spot for Jimmy Johns when I realized I was parked right in front of Capriottis. \"Voted greatest sandwich in America\"? Hell yes, I'm in! 

Ordered the Capastrami, medium with chips and a drink. $12 and change. I could literally hear my wallet mumble something about being America's greatest this or that but I paid it no mind. 

The sub was fairly large in stature but slim in flavor. Maybe it's because I'm from the East Coast and know what pastrami is supposed to taste like or maybe it's just because I like my food seasoned. .. I dunno but I think this time my wallet was right. The food was a bit pricy for what you get. 

Next time I'm walking the extra 50 feet and going to JJ's."}
{"text":"I get the large steak and cheese with mushrooms and onions! It's huge and yummy and I eat the whole thing! Just had one!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich, had the Bobby, Turkey, stuffing and cranberries. Bread was fantastic, soft and the right amount of chew. The fixings we perfect and fresh. I will make the Bobby one of my favorite sandwiches and stop by for one when ever in town."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. We had a chicken cheese steak and a hot pastrami sub. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Very dirty location... Long wait... Food is great.. They better hope health inspector doesn't  dropsby.. Under staffed.."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this shop. It's been a while since I ordered cause they kept messing my food up.  Well they did it again. They cannot read what is requested.  And then a bone in it...which was a fairly decent size.  Picture posted to scale.  This location needs to reevaluate some its values."}
{"text":"Grilled Italian with lettuce tomato mayo salt pepper oregano with pickles on the side...no onions or peppers. In and out with an awesome sandwich while on the road!"}
{"text":"Not bad. Great marketing!!  Small cheese steak, chips and large soda $12.  I saved $2 by downloading their app on the spot and redeeming a $2 coupon. Cheese steak was ok... Probably wouldn't go back. There are too many better lunch places nearby at that price."}
{"text":"I don't want to sound like a dud because this my favorite sandwich shop. This is the worst hot capastrami I've ever had. I pretty much just paid $9.31 for a loaf of bread. The bread was dry and hard, there was hardly any meat or Russian dressing. Meh."}
{"text":"Another fantastic visit to Capriotti's (as usual)! We got our chicken cheesesteak fix today and it was so delicious! We definitely agree that these guys have better cheesesteak than most cheesesteak places. The staff is always friendly and know who we are whether we order online or on the phone (maybe this means we eat here wayyy too much)! Thanks again.... we will surely be back soon."}
{"text":"Love this location! Placed an order through the Yelp app and it was hot and ready with my specifications of extra dressing (caviar am lover!!) Got a free drink for checking in...Thanks again!"}
{"text":"An indulgent deli, and I mean that in the best of ways.  Subway healthy this is not- and that is ok.  I come here if I want a good old fashioned splurge type of deli sandwich.  I ordered the 20 inch (!) Capastrami. Lots of salt on the pastrami,  full on mayo based  cole slaw, and no wheat rolls here.  Hits the spot.  

Staff friendly, sandwich made in less than five minutes."}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever. The pastrami is bomb, the cheesesteak is moist and has the perfect amount of cheese on it. Then there is the Bobbie, all thanksgiving goodness in one sandwich. 

Service is fast and friendly. The prices are super reasonable and the portions are huge.

Basically you need to try these sandwiches. 

Oh! They have diet wild cherry Pepsi!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Saw the great reviews. I have to say though I made a mistake in ordering a cold sandwich. For some reason I thought The Bobbie would be served on a hot bread. I must've been really thinking about Earls and their holiday sandwich because that's what I thought I was getting. When the sandwich came out cold I was a bit disappointed. Again, my fault for not reading it clearly on the menu but I'm not too sure that combination (cold sandwich with stuffing and turkey) works. 

Also, some of the servers didn't look too friendly. Seemed like they didn't like being there. The Yelp check-in offer for a large soda was amazing. Definitely do that if you are going in. I would say Earls wins over this. I wouldn't venture all the way out to Red Rock to try this."}
{"text":"My sandwich was made to perfection. The philly mushroom cheese steak sandwich is delicious. Must try. Kinda pricey but well worth it. Super fast and good service!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Asked for NO onions and they put onions. Turkey was dry. Ordered clam chowder soup and it was sour. Needless to say, I could not eat my food. I am not a picky eater, but I was quite grossed out."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place!

The Bobby! The pastrami sammiches! Forgettaboudit! 

A 20\" sandwich for $14? And filled with delicious meat and fixings? YES! No wimpy sandwiches here, no way. We usually split a 20\" sammich, which is more than enough. 

The Bobby as you may have read is with fresh baked pulled turkey meat, real cranberry sauce and stuffing. I get it with extra cranberry and mayo. 

The staff is super friendly and almost always get your orders right. If not they will gladly make it right, fast!

Today I got a pastrami with provolone,  red onion, mayo and cole slaw. What a great combo. They always pack a lot of meat into their sandwiches too, they don't play around. The meat is good quality, not the usual franchise junk.

They also offer salads, soups and gourmet cookies for before and after the big sammich. Try it out, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is my favorite lunchtime eatery in San Diego. I was delighted that they seemed to have store wherever I went. Soni was I heaven when I saw this one in Henderson.

The 'Hot' Bobbie is my favorite but I try to give equal time to the Italian Sausage sub with sweet and hot peppers! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"This my \"Ish\". I love the Bobbie and skaw-b-jo. The guys at the counter are cool(most ) days. They've come through w/hook ups and good service."}
{"text":"I live in Hawaii and whenever I go to the mainland I have to hit up Capriotti's for a Capastrami.  Service was great.  The Capastrami was great.  This is not the usual location I go to in Las Vegas, but it worked out for me."}
{"text":"Bobbie and the Capastrami are to die for!  I love this location because they've always been so friendly and speedy.  Unless the college is in session, it's pretty empty.  So if you want great service, awesome food made quickly, visit this location."}
{"text":"Fail! We came in on a slow Sunday afternoon and ordered two sandwiches, chips and drinks. $23 bucks. That's a little high for a glorified Quizno's. Then they only gave us one sandwich. It was another 10 minutes and my partner had to go to the counter and ask where his sandwich was. They still couldn't figure it out. Turns out they made it and it was sitting there. No one called it out. They had NO clue. 

As for the food, meh. Nothing special. The bread is just like any other chain sandwich shop, mushy white bread. Can't anyone make true Italian bread? Save yourself some cold hard cash and go to Jimmy John's.

We won't be running back here anytime soon. It's too bad I really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"What's with all the low ratings for this place?  Service was excellent.  The food is excellent.  The ambiance is excellent.  It is clean.  It is quick.  Folks are friendly.  Prices are very reasonable.

I'm not sure what else people are looking for, Capriotti's has it all!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Capriotti's in San Diego ever since it opened, so I was excited to see we were going to be staying across the street from this Capriotti's for a soccer tournament in Vegas.

Saturday morning, at 9:30 am, I went into this Capriotti's and ordered a large (20\") veggie turkey.  I planned to live off of this sandwich for the rest of the day, since I would be stuck at the soccer fields all day, and after playing three games I knew I'd be starving.  So, I ordered it without oil or vinegar or peppers, hoping it wouldn't get soggy and would be good all day.

Well, well, well, this baby lasted me the whole entire day!  And, it didn't get soggy!  It was glorious.

Thank you Capriotti's!  The only thing that kept you from five stars is that it is hard to compete when I am comparing to the San Diego location, with freakishly friendly staff and packets of tapatio!"}
{"text":"This is the Best restaurant in the Top ten listed here, And it is the only one that you can leave without spending $100 minimum. (with the exception of In 'N' out.....)"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a quick salad because I was really hungry. It tasted great when the salad finally came out. Unfortunately, because they were making mine freshly chopped, it took a little longer than I wanted to wait."}
{"text":"Take a break from the strip and get over here for lunch! Order the capastrami, it the Bobbie and enjoy some good eats. 

The Capastrami is lovely with it's warm pastrami, delicious Russian dressing, and crunchy cole slaw. The Bobbie is like thanksgiving in a sandwich and its awesome. I love the inclusion of stuffing because that's always my favorite part of Thanksgiving. The sandwiches run big with a medium being both my lunch and dinner. This place is on point."}
{"text":"Awesome steak sandwiches.  The meat is very tender and very flavorful, you won't be let down I just wished I ordered more my first time there. There is always next time though.  So far everything I have had here is excellent and I just say you should go try it out.  Next time I am going to try the italian sub there, should be good.  I need to go back here soon."}
{"text":"I used door dash to order from Capriotti's, so I'm only assuming it was this location my food came from. I ordered a couple of salads to split into meals for lunch this week. They were both delicious! They sent lots of dressing - MORE than I needed, which is always a good thing even if I don't use it. I'll be trying some sandwiches soon!"}
{"text":"It's a little on the pricey side but they do give you a pretty big sandwich. I have been there twice now and really liked their meatball sub but wasn't crazy about their \"Bobbie\". I am going to go back and try their cheesesteak as well so maybe I'll update again after I do that (I love a good cheesesteak)."}
{"text":"I used to eat here at least once a week for years and it was great every time. Sadly they got a bunch of new undertrained people in there and the quality and consistency has suffered greatly. This came to a head the last time when I ordered a cheesesteak and, aside from the flavor and proportions being off, after I ate about half of it I noticed some straight up raw pieces of steak mixed in. Sure enough I spent the next couple days very very sick with food poisoning.

I love Capriotti's and will still eat at other locations, maybe even this location again in the future, but this place in its current state is no good. Sad days."}
{"text":"Very friendly and courteous team at this location! Try the cheesesteak with mushrooms onions and peppers! The best! And great convenient location.."}
{"text":"Great location! Right inside the Green Valley Ranch casino, park on the roof of the parking garage for easy walk in access! Very friendly staff and great food!"}
{"text":"Half turkey, half chili soup. Wasn't asked what bread I wanted and came w roll. They were ok and a quick meal. If have more time would recommend Grand Cafe's salmon and baked potato, which is memorable!"}
{"text":"Even if you're in Vegas for just a couple days, this place is worth a visit for a quick bite. Their sandwiches are huge and full of flavor. They're known for 'the Bobbie' aka the Thanksgiving sub. It's turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes - sooooo goooooood. Worked a conference in Vegas last year and we ordered Capriotti's in for lunch almost every day. If you're in the Las Vegas Convention Center, check to see if they have a location set up for your conference.. they did for ABC '14 in October last year."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Called in an order,  came to pick it up and it was made wrong. I asked the cashier, joseph, if it could be remade. He made some annoyed noises and huffed at me saying that we ordered it wrong. I asked him to please remake it and he said \"fine, whatever, that's mean making us remake it.\" Wow, seems like I'm talking to a twelve year old. Horrible service, I will never be back."}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly. Sandwiches were very good. I definitely recommend this place for a quick no hassle lunch."}
{"text":"My first time here. Customer service was rude too me. I was yelled at For no reason. Haven't tried the food yet but it's not going to matter because I'm not coming back."}
{"text":"This was a good place for just what we wanted. We did not want a big meal or something fancy just good food away from the strip. I think alot of people are regulars and people that work in the area. 
We all had subs...meatball and roast beef. My 3 boys raved about the meatball subs. I had roast beef with cole slaw, but it seemed to have more slaw then meat. 
The workers were all friendly and helpful and the only reason i am giving it 3 stars was because of my sub and the bathrooms were not in the best of condition."}
{"text":"How do you know when you in a real East Coast kinda sub shop?  When you open the door and all you smell is vinegar!  YUM!!!!  

I had the pastrami sandwich and it was delicious-quality meat, good bread!  What more can you ask for?

Will I come back?  Hell, Yes!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich place in Vegas. I got the turkey with cranberry. It reminds me of thanksgiving. My friend got the Italian blt and it was incredible as well. Whenever I visit Vegas I definitely stop by here."}
{"text":"not as good as they used to be. I used to go to Capriotti's allot to get my steak and mushroom sup fix. it was good but not as good as it used to be."}
{"text":"Serious hole-in-the-wall in an obscure strip mall!

Placed a to-go order online the day before. The online system was very easy to use. Came to the shop to pick up my order, everything was packaged nicely and had the appropriate name of who each item was for written on there. The whole transaction was a breeze. 

The 2 sandwiches I ordered were both very tasty, but the salad leaves much to be desired. The obvious lack of freshness on the greens cause minus 1 star. 

Parking was very easy on a weekday."}
{"text":"I am a Jimmy Johns and Potbelly kind of girl, so it took me a lot of suggestions from friends before I tried this place. The only thing I would ever go to Capriotti's for that nobody else offers is the thanksgiving goodness-on-a-loaf that is The Bobbie. Dear carb-city.. I love thee. Besides the indulgent nature of that sandwich (if we can call it just a sandwich) is that the people were very awesome. My experience was calling in an order before I went on my lunch break at work, showing up and realizing I did not have my wallet (AHH!) and they did not give me any hassle for it. Thanks guys for not making me feel like a total dumb-dumb!"}
{"text":"Had the Bobby,  thanksgiving between bread.  Very delicious.  They are quick even though they are superbusy."}
{"text":"Hadn't been up to this new location yet. Pretty nice layout, not like the dinky crowded one I usually go to...and I think they menu prices reflect that. Just because its in summerlin, let's jack up the prices! Bah! I know I don't pay $9 for a sandwich in my regular shop...regardless, the sandwich chain is still one of my faves"}
{"text":"Almost need to do 2 reviews for this place. Food is great, one of my favorite sandwiches around. I don't buy into the Bobbie hype, that's a so-so sandwich to me. I prefer the ham and cheese. Either way, they always taste fresh and the price can't be beat.

Gripe 1 - Why they don't take a RebelCard discount is beyond me, all the other business around here do AND the company is owned by UNLV Alum....

Gripe 2 - the absolute WORST ordering counter ever. It's about 5 feet tall and 3 feet wide so if you're short (I am not) you have to stand on your tip toes and either way you have to shout your order. It's very confusing too, when people come in they're not sure whether to order at this monstrosity of a counter or the cashier counter, there's no signs and no employee actually offers any help or direction.

Gripe 3 - it's always too friggen hot in there. Even in winter. Summer, forget about it, you're sweating your ass off - period.

So for that I give 3 stars. It would be 5 for the food and 1 for the actual business"}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious sandwiches. I'm surprised it is in a food court in a casino off the strip. Workers were very friendly. The only negative is that the day I was there the ice machine was broken and the sodas were warm. Check it out if you are staying at the hotel!"}
{"text":"So i called this location to do a to go order and i was told they close at 7pm. I told Caitlyn that the website says 8pm. She rudely says our door says 7pm. I then said that its misleading. Her response again was our door says 7pm.  Really wow could of just said im sorry the website is incorrect I'll let management know. She did not have to be rude about."}
{"text":"Great place to go when you want a quick dinner that's healthy too. the Bobby\" which is just like Thanksgiving on a hero is my favorite ! They have good salads too, I especially like the chicken balsamic."}
{"text":"This restaurant represents the epitome of great customer service! Everything from the cleanliness of the store to the friendliness of the staff made it a great dining experience. I normally don't like sandwiches but the general manager (I think his name was Joe) was kind enough to give me a recommendation that I ended up loving. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"They have a great Philly Cheese sandwich
Guys an gals that work there are friendly
When you leave a top they call out \"Beer Money\"

Soup is good too"}
{"text":"Ok...so I forgot about cyber Monday when I arrived...so bummed, until, Josh, the manager looked at me and smiled and simply said, don't worry about it. We got you covered. He gave me the discount anyway Anna free freshly baked cookie. The food alone is a good enough reason to head on over here, but the customer service is exemplary."}
{"text":"if i could give these place no stars i would.was at hard rock with friends. stopped in late, place was dirty and not run well. food was dry and bland. girl working there had a holy than attitude with us. should have went to pizza place next store. next time know better. very sad sandwich shop"}
{"text":"My sandwich was good but the dining room was filthy and disgusting. There was not a single table that was clean and the floor beneath them was just as filthy. Staff needs to clean the dining room more often. If the public dining space is that filthy, I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"I can eat any of the Cap's specials.  My favorite's still the Capastrami.  I've tried the regular sandwiches also, and they're also big in portions.  Also tasty.  Although many of the other sandwiches are really good, I'd stick with the Cap's Specials since that's what they're known for."}
{"text":"No restroom to wash your hands in this establishment. Seems like s screw you to the customer and should be a violation to not provide patrons a bathroom. I will never come back here. Had to get my sandwich to go home and eat so I could wash my darn hands. Water here tastes horrible too btw."}
{"text":"Ordered take out online and sent one of my assistants to pick up the order for our team. She came back and there was olives on my salad when I clicked the no olives option, and there was no dressing. How am I supposed to eat my salad when I'm at work and can't leave to find dressing? Such a simple mistake but it makes such a big difference. Super disappointed. Three stars only because my coworkers are enjoying their meals."}
{"text":"This place sucks a s s through a crazy straw!
The ladies were rude, my order took a long time and my sandwich was dry."}
{"text":"Holy Shit. Ive never had a sandwich this good!

Had the small (9\") cold Italian sandwich.

As described on their site:
\"A flavorful combination of italian deli meats. Made with Genoa Salami, Capacolla, Prosciutini\".

Its served on a freshly-baked soft white roll (secret recipe) + all the fixins + provolone cheese.

The location is sketchy at best. Down the street from the Sahara Casino in a small mini-mall area patronized by some of Las Vegas' finest walkin the streets folks."}
{"text":"Do not order online from this location.  I've ordered twice and both times selected No Cranberry on the Bobbie.  On both occasions, I've received the Bobbie, left to go back to work and found the sandwich caked in cranberry.

My mistake for not checking before I left, but I asked the person at the counter who repeated no cran before I left.  

Thanks, Capriotti's on Blue Diamond, for nothing."}
{"text":"We had passed this place many times and I wanted to try it so we stopped there yesterday. I was extremely disappointed and we will never go back. I ordered a roast beef sandwich. I'm used to deli style RB that's pink and tasty. What they serve looked like pulled pork. The bread was no better than what you get at Subway. A $9.00 sandwich should be at least halfway decent. My wife ordered half soup and half Bobbie. She didn't like it either. So much for the food. Now for the service and the place. There were two guys behind the counter. One took our order and the other brought the food to the table. Neither one could muster a smile. I'd added a tip at the counter but honestly had I known I was going to have to get up for napkins I'd not have. My wife and I were the only ones in the place except for two people who were done soon after we sat. There were crumbs on each and every table and some of the chairs and benches and the two employees were just standing behind the counter watching the game on TV. In summary food was lousy, service was lousy, cleanliness was lousy. Frankly I can't see how this establishment can pay it's rent. As for the sign proclaiming award winning sandwiches I suppose anyone can say what they want. That doesn't make it so."}
{"text":"I was a bit wary eating the Bobbie, but O.M.G. this was an AMAZING SANDWICH!  I was staying in Henderson at the time when my friend came and picked me up.  She asked me what I wanted to eat and I said I didn't care as long as it was good.  

The first thing she said was ok, we are going to get this sandwich that I have been craving for over a month and a half.  If anyone craves for something for over a month, then that sandwich MUST be delicious!  Or at least that's my rule. ;-)  

We go into the restaurant, I look around and notice there really isn't much seating inside.  We were lucky to grab three stools and sit at the \"bar\" inside.  My friend told me I had to try to eat the Bobbie and so I did.  Be careful, these sandwiches are HUGE!  I could not even finish a small....

Bobbie:  Fresh roasted turkey topped with cranberry sauce and stuffing.  Yes cranberry sauce.  I was a bit skeptical when I heard that but I was open-minded enough to try.  My first bite, AMAZING!  All of the three really go together making the sandwich whole.  This is one sandwich everyone has to try!  Unless you're allergic to one of the ingredients. =P  

Also on a side note, the sandwich is cold.  Sharing is always good!"}
{"text":"I have been increasingly disappointed in Capriotti's. I have never been able to eat a 9\" turkey sandwich with everything on it in a single sitting. Until now. It was mostly bread. There were traces of turkey on it with hints of toppings. When I started eating at Capriotti's over 15 years ago, the sandwiches would be overflowing, because there would be so much turkey on them, the roll could hardly contain it and the plentiful toppings. My sandwich would usually feel as heavy as a brick. Today it was a feather. I might as well have gone to Subway. Sadly, this is not an isolated event or location - it has been the downward trend now at this location, as well as the one on Cheyenne. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let me start by writing that I LOVE Capriotti's, but not lately. I always get a turkey sub with absolutely everything on it, messy and dripping with all of the toppings. The sandwich is usually busting with turkey, not deli turkey, but real turkey. However, the last few times I've gotten it the amount of turkey was minimal - barely there. Very disappointing given that I appreciated the good value the sandwiches have always been. Unfortunately, with the new owners I think they have instituted a new policy about the amount of meat you get. So, it's no longer delectable or a good value. How sad. I may have to drive to another location to see if it's a corporate-wide policy. I hope not."}
{"text":"We stopped here because we were looking for a sandwich, and we saw the great reviews here.  Being on vacation, sometimes you just need something simple and satisfying - like a sandwich.  

The reviews were on point - we had the Cole Turkey and it was a great sandwich.  Not only was the turkey fresh and tasty, but the cole slaw was the best I have ever had.

The sandwich was so good, we actually stopped there again on our way back from Arizona.  We wanted to try the similar version with roast beef, but they were out of it, so we had the same Cole Turkey again.  It was as delicious as the first time.

While the sandwiches made us come back again, the wonderful, friendly and welcoming folks who work there will be the reason we would visit again and again when and if we are in the area.

If you are in the neighborhood, it would be worth your while to stop here for a meal."}
{"text":"Really delicious! I've never seen a sub shop offer vegetarian turkey, so I was beyond stoked when I saw that, and it didn't disappoint! They did put mustard instead of mayo like I asked, and it is a bit pricey, but the product itself was delicious. (even with the mustard mix up!)"}
{"text":"This was awesome VERY helpful staff told them they should put in a cappriotties in Portland Oregon.  We also got a free cookie!! Kicks butt over subway! Fresh meat made daily! Yummy not all processed like subway"}
{"text":"i go there sometime a year. anyway,but this time, their taste is little strange. i'm not food, meat professional. but can see something wrong..i hoped i don't get sick from strange taste. that was a cole turkey. after that day, i tried beef sandwich.. same strange taste..dammn.. what is wrong ? me or them..but still nice cole slaw, and bread.. i can see employees different than before. maybe owner changed. so, their  type taste they made ?  i decide not to go there, 6 month.. i try today other place on flaming rd.. ya. there turkey taste is usual and ok..but i can say, flamingo cole slaw is need more do something like paradise store.. they need learn from them will make more nice flamingo store..and some professional need check paradise store. i hope..their meat process.."}
{"text":"Worst customer service. This one guy was so rude and condescending. He must have major job security thinking he can treat customers the way he did. Brand new customer and you treat me poorly? Worst sandwich ever to top it all off. Best thing was their chips that I received half a bag for. Anything would have been better at this point!"}
{"text":"Ridiculously awesome sandwiches, huge portions. When I call in an order, usually a Bobby or ham n cheese I have to split it with my wife. Place is immaculate,  staff is friendly and service is fast. Haven't had a bad experience yet."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but the subs are so delicious it is hard to resist. I wouldn't say we are regulars but we return every once in awhile."}
{"text":"Capriottis came into the local market not too long after I moved here from Vegas.  I was very happy to see them here as I need to feed my Sandwich addiction from time to time.  This location is the nicest and largest Capriotti's I've ever seen....and I love it!

I had the 12\" Italian Sandwich w/Hot Peppers, $8.49 and added Chips for $.99.

The Sandwich tasted just like the Sandwiches in Vegas...so it's consistent across their stores.  My favorite topping is the Hot Peppers....they're legitimately hot, which is how I like it.  I can't stand it when Sandwich shops advertise \"Hot\" Peppers when in fact they're really mild.

The employees here are friendly and keep the place clean.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Ordered through Grubhub the food was great! I got the capture 2 with the Bobbie and BBQ chicken salad and everything was so amazing! Salad was packed with topping!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for Lunch the other day.  This particular location has a handful of tables and chairs inside.  When I went, there were only a few people in the joint.

I ordered a Small (9\") Italian Sub (Genoa Salami, Capacola, Prosciutini) w/Hot Peppers, Provolone, Mustard, Mayo, Pickles, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions.  Also had a bag of Jalapeno Chips and Bottled Water to go with the Sandwich.

The food came out a few minutes later and I dove right in.  As usual, it was a sloppy meal with stuff falling out of the Sandwich.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  For some reason, even though it's a Small Sandwich, it's always very filling.

Over the years Capriotti's has declined somewhat.  It use to blow me away, now that it's been franchised I think their ingredients have lost some quality....can't support that with fact, only my opinion after eating at various Capriotti's for over 17 yrs.

Will I return?  Probably, but won't crave it like I use to."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today.  Almost went to Joe's Pizza next door, but opted for a sandwich instead.  I've been eating Capriottis sandwiches for years, but this is the first time in this particular restaurant.

The place was busy and the people working there were friendly.  Nice clean tables and floors.

I ordered a small Italian Sandwich with everything on it.  Got a bag of Jalapeno Dirty Chips & a bottle of water.  The sandwich turned out nice and fresh, but I don't know.....Capriottis has lost a lot of it's luster with me.  I just don't enjoy their sandwiches like I use to.  I don't know what it is.  

Will I return?  Probably, but not on the top of my list."}
{"text":"I love the Scottsdale Rd and Indian School location . The best best best. I don't think the one in north scottsdale is as good"}
{"text":"Fairly new location, so the space is really clean. Gotta go with the classic Bobbie, it's basically Thanksgiving stuffed into a sandwich which then gets stuffed into my mouth. It's so yummy!"}
{"text":"Such a great place the homemade turkey sub is amazing! The spices are just right, and you the person OR online can customize your order to your liking. It's made perfectly :)"}
{"text":"Came here at lunchtime (13:30pm) on a Tues. Absolutely no parking! Looks like PT'S takes all the parking.  Awesome staff and great sandwiches but almost left when I couldn't find a spot to park."}
{"text":"Their meatball sub was average. Their cheese steak isnt bad, id eat that again at a different location. So why the low rating? Well, this place is filthy. They dont clean their tables. I saw a guy that worked their, walk around to push chairs in, but didnt clean anything off tables except for a napkin. Floors were just as dirty. On top of that, they have a blue light right above the coffee maker that has a lot of dead bugs on it."}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich place in the valley! I LOVE the veggie turkey sub because it comes with vegetarian deli turkey slices and I don't know of any other place where this is available. A vegetarians dream come true!"}
{"text":"** UPDATE** 
After an 8 month break from this Capriotti's I decided to give it another chance. Bad idea... I called in my order to pick up and of course it was made wrong! Don't go to this location ever! The location on Las Vegas blvd and Silverado is much better!!! 

would give this zero stars but since that isn't an option.... I tried calling to place a Togo order for me and 6 of my employees for my meeting and of course they have their phone off the hook again! Thankfully firehouse subs answered when a paying guest calls for a large order..... If the owner reads this I think it's time to put in new management and competent, efficient employees in this place."}
{"text":"As if Capriotti's actually needs another review? LOL. But here I go, here I go, here I go... 

When I first moved to Vegas, I couldn't stop hearing about the \"Thanksgiving sub\" with turkey, cranberry and stuffing. It sounded mega weird but I was definitely still willing to give it a shot. So I did and I gotta say, I was *not* impressed whatsoever! The bread was soggy, the turkey was tasteless and the storefront was bare bones boring. 

Second shot: chicken philly...much, much better than that super odd Thanksgiving sandwich but still not as good as Firehouse or Jersey Mike's. 

I'd go back, if I was drunk or hungover and needed fuel to get me thru the day post boozin'. But sober, meh...don't think so. lol."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place that has some pretty good sandwich's. I got the vegetarian turkey sandwich they also have vegetarian cheese steak (unfortunately no vegan cheese) , but its nice to have some veg options."}
{"text":"While Capriottis is a convenient stop on the way to the strip from the airport or for UNLV students, I don't really get the popularity of this sandwich shop. For their signature sub sandwich \"The Bobbie\", they simply stuff a soft roll with shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, ice cold stuffing, and a crap ton of mayo. Go fatty America?!

While the roll is a better than average soft roll, I'd expect better tasting turkey to pair it with since with the skimpy amount of shredded turkey included, it tasted both salty and cold. The large amount of cranberry sauce with mayo didn't compliment it well either and the large chunks of cold stuffing just made the sandwich taste like something I threw together by accident on a drunk night.

I think the sandwich would of been far better if it was heated, but then again the heat would probably just mask the taste. People that go to Capriottis must really love having their stuffing cold or need a yearlong reminder what Thanksgiving tastes like. Perhaps the other pastrami special is better. 

Head to Earl's for a flavor explosion instead, imo."}
{"text":"If I ever leave Las Vegas Capriotti's will be the only thing I miss.  This is the only Capriotti's I went to that had an actual dine in sit down area.  All the other Capriotti's I've gone to had 2 or 3 tables for their sit down area and that was it.  I think they put coleslaw on all of their sandwiches so I always order w/no slaw since I'm not a fan of it.  My favorite sandwich here is the capastrami.  The sla-be-joe was ok and the bobby is always a good choice.  They have plenty of other sandwiches to choose from but I haven't tried any others because I always get the capastrami.  The prices here are a little more than what you'd expect from a sandwich place but I feel like it's definitely worth it and it's still very reasonable.  A small 9 inch sub is around $7, a medium 12 inch is $9 and a large 20 inch is $13.  Every time you eat here they give you a $3 off coupon for your next visit.  You have to go online and fill out a short questionnaire but it's worth it to get some money off for your next visit.  

Other than the coleslaw overload the only thing I don't like about this place is that they close at 8 but they are still deserving of 5 stars despite of that."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch break and we really enjoyed our sandwiches. It was very healthy and we walked out feeling full and satisfied. Great place, great service, great food."}
{"text":"I am doing a flash back into time and reviewing this place. I lived in Las Vegas for a year during a post graduate program about  5 years ago. From the look of the reviews, the place has not changed much. But, take that into consideration. I used to get all over LV., and this was my all time favorite place to have lunch. It is likely the best sandwich place on the planet!!! 

My first exposure to them was at a couple different work locations. They do sandwich trays for catering. They just kept poppin up everywhere I went (new work/training location every 4 weeks). The great thing about catered sandwich trays is 1. then are free to me, and 2. you can try a few different types of sandwiches. Over time I tried several. But, my favorite was their Bobby. It was a turkey, cranberry and stuffing sandwich on a soft roll with mayonnaise. It makes my mouth water. I was never a stuffing fan as a kid (those nasty gizzards in there turned me off!). But, this was like a nice bread or cornbread stuffing without the extra fluff. Damn, what a great combination. It was just to die for. And with several of these places around town, I could get them just about anywhere I was. I cant say I ate them all that often, but I used to run from the plaza where this one is and dinner was an easy stop off here. 

Whether you are from Vegas or just visiting, get by a Capriottis. All of their sandwiches are great but the Bobby is SOOOOO GOOOD, you just have to try it out. And, if you are catering your work lunch, think about them too so all your staff can enjoy.

Capriotti's needs to franchise to the bay area, PLEASE!!!!"}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's. I just am not a huge fan of this one. The stor is set up all wrong. It does not flow well and then some jack ass decided to put a bistro table in front of the cash register, under the television monitor, so if you are trying to eat, at that table, you get the added benefit of people running back and forth to the bathroom you get to look into and have people cough on your food while they are waiting in line for their order or to pay. The Jack ass that thought this was a good idea should have that table shoved squarely up their arse. Not a pleasant experience to eat inside, so take your deli goodness and LEAVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot. 1st time at this location. Walked in and was greeted right away. Got the grilled Italian. Was better this time. Good amount of meat. Liked it grilled. Would be better if bun was toasted too, because it got very soggy. Went there about 3 o'clock and was the only customer. There were at least a half-dozen employees there which seemed a little overstaffed for the time. Overall I'm still not impressed with Capriotti's. Idk what people are thinking when they rate this place the best for subs. More and more I'm convinced people from Las Vegas are crazy."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are freaking delicious. Came here and all the tables were dirty there was more than enough employees to have someone clean them. Honestly don't dine in take your order to go. Sanitation is not important here"}
{"text":"I went in since I got an email the veggie turkey has returned after months of not having it. Fortunately they offer two other veggie options but of course the veggie turkey is delicious for us vegetarians. I was told that they didn't have it in, I mentioned the email and the manager said that a lot of stores got it in but it sold out immediately. He said he was new General Manager and I believe his name was Mark. Because of my disappointment in not having the veggie turkey he offered me free chips and a free drink. He also said he would check with his sister stores and try to get the veggie turkey in. I appreciate when people care about vegetarian options even though they themselves aren't vegetarian. 

The veggie cheeseburger was good too, as it consistently is and I always love their $3 off surveys even though I never seem to carry one at the time I want Capriottis."}
{"text":"A very interesting concept of samiches....

Cole slaw mixed in with a samich? What? Yes, that is correct and  it's damn good!  The call it the Capistrami, oh sooo good n tasty, hot n cold, spicy n mild, ying n yang, ping n pong....u get the picture.

Another called the slaw-be-joe with roast beef.....haven't tried that yet.  The cheesesteak is good and the grilled italian, oh sooo gooooood.

I goota say this is the BEST hott samich so far in Vegas.....til next time, good samich eatin!"}
{"text":"This Town Square Capriotti's location is in the old Johnny McGuire's space, upstairs facing the AMC movie theater.  Even though it's small, it still has more seating than a lot of Cap's around town due to a bar that wraps around the edge of the restaurant facing the windows.  Always good for people watching.  The staff is pleasant, and the food always comes out fast and delicious, even when they are very busy.

The Cheesesteak, Italian, Roast Beef, and obviously the Bobbie (aka Thanksgiving on a roll) are my favorite subs.  The balsamic chicken and Cap's Chopped are my salads.  

Don't forget to download their app to get free subs!"}
{"text":"Good food for when you're in a bind. Bread made locally, tasty subs, (usually) fresh turkey."}
{"text":"Why settle for Thanksgiving only once a year? You can pretty much eat your fill of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce in the form of a sandwich year-round. The Bobbie was a revelation when I first tried it and it hasn't lost its luster. However, I would love it even more if it had a touch of gravy and if the turkey came hot.

Not in the mood for a tryptophan-laced meal? Try their cheese steaks. The hot peppers really add a kick to the spice factor. The best part is that this location is open 24 hours a day to handle your late-night cravings."}
{"text":"Hands down the biggest Sando portion in the world. Fast. Cheap and best of all good taste. Amazing price for Vegas next to the hard rock"}
{"text":"No complaints. 

Bobbie, meatball, cheesesteak... We all loved each one that we got. Well priced for Vegas! Tasty subs made to order with friendly service."}
{"text":"The two times I've been to this location, the service has been really friendly. Both times the cashiers were really helpful and patient when I took awhile to decide what to get. 

Capistrami: I really liked this sandwich. They put a lot of sauce and cole slaw though. It actually tasted better after I put it into the fridge for awhile. Probably because the sauce got a little thicker from being cold and it was a little less messy.

Slaw be Jo: I didn't like this sandwich at all. I was very disappointed. I usually like roast beef sandwiches, but this one was really salty. My fridge trick didn't even work on it."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab 2 subs on way back to airport.  Took 25 mins after we ordered and only one order in front of us.  Staff was nice and she told the couple ahead of us their order was almost ready.  They had to wait another 10 mins.  Ten mins later said the same to us and we had to wait an additional 10 mins."}
{"text":"This Capriotti's (on Sahara, near the strip) has been remodeled and now has longer hours, including being open on Sunday.

Finally! 
Maybe they read my previous review. 
Wait a minute....scratch that....they still don't make their own bread. 
So they are still an angel's breath away from perfection."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm sad that I didn't find out about this place earlier. I'm just glad I now know of a great sandwich shop that is very unique and not like many others. They really seem to come up with some creative and delicious creations. I got the bobbi and the cheese steak and both were very very good.

The Bobbi tasted like the morning after Thanksgiving day which turkey, stuffing, and cranberry. It really was the perfect combination. Not too soggy, not too dry. 
The cheese steak had a little bit of a kick with the peppers and it definitely had the right amount of meat and cheese combination. I can't wait to try out the Capistrami next time which looks amazing. 

As for value, i think it's quite good for a 9' sub (plenty for me) for about $7. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"First time ever eating at this fun little deli sandwich shop. Many options to choose from, and made fresh right there. The sandwich was huge, and I had both a salad and half a sandwich.  Very feeling, and tasty. Not sure why I have never heard of this place, and kinda feel like I have been missing out. Maybe I should get out more. Making a subtle hint for my husband...not sure if he will even read this review or not, but anyway very yummy. Glad I had a chance to try it. Moving on up in my little world, ha ha."}
{"text":"Primo sandwhiches - I usually go for the philly steak or the Bobbie. Love this location too. Always great service. 

If I could change anything I wish they would bring back their entertainment book coupons."}
{"text":"My wife and her law firm have been eating at the FLW/101 location for quite awhile now and she has been raving about it! I discovered there was this location down the street from my office and have been eating here just about every other day for lunch! Last week our office placed an order for a meeting! The sandwhiches taste the same every time!!!

I have ordered the Italian, Turkey and the Bobbie! I usually change things up on my order and not once have i had a bad sandwhich or gotten back to my office with anything but what I ordered. I recently started ordering the cheesesteak, and although my favorite cheesesteaks usually have cheese-wiz, I freaking love their sandwich! I add extra cheese to it and it is amazing tasting. I haven't ordered anything but this sandwich the last 10 visits. 

Warren is a top notch owner and was actually the person who took my order on todays visit. It is nice to see an owner that is hands on with his company!! You do not come across that very often and when you do, they usually aren't running the register. 

I will keep eating here and I will recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a good sub, especially if you like turkey!!"}
{"text":"Staff is very slow, it took more than 25 mins to make 4 simple cold sandwiches and there weren't too many people in the shop. Currently 6 people in line and are not being helped, definitely understaffed."}
{"text":"Large portions. Took a long time to get my sandwich and little seating at the shop. Definitely a call-ahead place.

Had the grilled italian. Great flavor! Would definitely get again."}
{"text":"When visiting Vegas there are a few ways to ball out on a budget, one is using airbnb for your lodging needs and the other... eating off the strip at Capriotti's! This place is wonderful! The staff is super friendly and attentive. It did take a while to receive my sandwich, but I will chalk my impatience up to starvation, and besides the sandwich was well worth the wait. Capriotti's also, as I mentioned, is very wallet friendly; three of us each had a medium sub 3 drinks and a bag of chips for $27 can't beat that! I will definitely make it a point to return; most likely before I leave."}
{"text":"We are Cappriotti's fans, but this Downtown Summerlin location is new and we won't be back despite the easy parking and great location. The teenage cashier got all four sandwich orders wrong, over and over, as we ordered. She simply wasn't paying attention and had no supervision for what became a ridiculous process of her entering the wrong thing in the computer, us reading it on the print out screen, correcting her, and her entering in another wrong version, us correcting again, until the screen finally showed the proper items. In addition, they didn't have any bottled water for sale - in Las Vegas on a 106 degree day. (We politely spoke with a manager and said the cashier needed help/training and noted that we were disappointed there was no water.) Of course, after all that, we opened our sandwiches  on Mt Charleston and three of four were completely wrong. (Who ever heard of a Bobbie on square sandwich bread?!) And the special ingredients we requested were wrong too.  We will drive another block, valet park, and walk in to the Red Rock location next time."}
{"text":"It's weird that that the reviews are so skewed for Capriottis Sandwich Shop. I have eaten here several times, and have enjoyed it each time. I think the thing that hurts them more than anything else is the \"Best Sandwich In America\" banner hanging out front. The sandwiches are really good... but best in America is a little far reaching.

That being said... I usually get the \"Bobby\"... Thanksgiving on a bun! It's a pretty damn good sandwich... it you like thanksgiving dinner. The turkey is freshly made, as is the stuffing they put on the sandwich. 

I have also had the meatball sub... also very good. 

I like this place. And I am pretty sure you will like this place. 

Make sure you tell them you signed up for their \"text message\" program to get a free drink and chips on your first visit."}
{"text":"Welcoming staff from the minute we walked in. Order was taken and repeated back and was made perfect. Could my ask for better service and a more friendly staff."}
{"text":"The cole slaw is in-flipping- believable!!!

We had never been to a Capriotti's before, so we gave it a shot. The woman behind the counter wasn't exactly friendly and definitely not helpful after asking if it was our first time there. I got the vegetarian turkey something or other and it was meh to say the least. The very best thing about the entire experience was the freaking cole slaw! I will go back, just to have a cole slaw sandwich. NO JUDGING. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches, especially the cheese steak but the customer service was what made me write this review.  

My brother left his sunglasses on the table and when we came back the next day to order sandwiches again ( yes again ) , one of the employees remembered us and asked if we left sunglasses on the table.   He was ecstatic especially when these were $500+ sunglasses.  

It's a great feeling to know there are good people in the world.  

Thank you employees of Capriotti's!!"}
{"text":"We stopped because of the reviews very accurate very good. The place is small not many seats. I had the turkey my wife had the roast beef both were very good. The only thing I did not like was the bread could've been better tasted like a large hot dog bun.
We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is always spot on. As soon as you walk you can smell all the yummy goodness!!! The food is always fresh an great an the service friendly and fast. All there sandwiches are great. My favorite is the Bobbie with all that turkey, stuffing an cranberry sauce. It reminds me of home. The Chicken an cheese philology is also a good one. The salads are great as well as the soup. I live this location most as it's close to my house an they are always great. They also have a loyalty program app where you can earn free sandwiches an you get surprises in your email for signing up. They make it so easy."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day and ordered the pastrami sandwich. I think this was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The staff was friendly and I will be definitely coming back. If you're in the area and craving a sandwich definitely come here!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Despite popular belief (and probably some weird legend), it is possible to ingest an entire Thanksgiving dinner within the confines of a 6\" sub!  I asked the good man behind the counter what he would recommend and the first thing that came out of his mouth was \"The Bobbie\", which is essentially a huge Thanksgiving feast pop tart.

Since I was new there and didn't know what else to get, I caved in to The Bobbie and it was frigging amazing.  Crammed between two loaves of French bread were roasted turkey, bread stuffing, cranberry sauce, and a thin slatter of mayo.  Sounds very heavy and probably can induce an after-lunch nap but it was pretty good.  I would suggest the smallest size sandwich if you're a light eater.  It's a cold sandwich but it works...all the gorging of Thanksgiving without the annoying whining relatives.
 
The shop itself is pretty small and located in a small strip mall just a few miles east of the Las Vegas Strip.  Being away from the strip made the sandwich pricing fair and store free of mobs of people.  It's fairly clean and the employees were very friendly and outgoing, especially if you're from out of town.

However if you do feel sleepy after inhaling The Bobbie, the Strip is just a stone's throw away."}
{"text":"Got sick of Subway on this road trip, so this is a refreshing variety. Friendly staff is always a plus. Too bad we didn't have time to try their hot subs."}
{"text":"Capriotti's has really good sandwiches and there food is extremely healthy.  I always order turkey sandwiches and the turkey taste as good as a Thanksgiving Day meal.  In particular, my favorite sandwich is \"The Bobbie\", with the stuffing and cranberry.  It just melts in your mouth, leaving to wonder when you will get more.  My only reason for not having a 5 star review is that there should be more room for sitting down and doing in.  There is only a few table tops and 3-4 chairs.  I'll still keep coming back though!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me lunch today.  He brought me the \"Bob\" sandwich.  The roll was fresh and chewy.  The turkey was hand pulled right off the bird.  As for the toppings on this sandwich was a little too much for me.   This sandwich is BIG.  I saved the other half for later.  The place was clean.  Staff was friendly and made our sandwiches according to our order."}
{"text":"I loved this sandwich!!!!! I have heard about this place from everyone I know. Tonight I got to go, yay!

Ok so walking in I expected more. It looks like an empty little place with a large counter. Mike placed our order. I ordered a medium sized The Bobbie. I'm expecting something smaller than a 12 inch at subway, hard on the outside French bread and to be asked what I want on it. 

None of that happened first off The Bobbie medium size is $8.50 and it looked like a foot long maybe a little bigger. The large size is 20 inches!!! Yeah too much for me. The bread is so super soft and just might be the best hoagie roll ever! Inside is a huge amount of freshly roasted and shredded turkey both white and dark meat, cranberry mayo chunky sauce and stuffing/dressing. It tastes like thanksgiving is in your mouth. All that is missing is sweet potatoes and gravy. Try this sandwich it is worth the money!!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff! The place was super busy, but we still hot our food very quickly. We are east coasters so we judge places on their sandwiches, lol. This place was amazing! I ordered a vegetarian steak sandwich, my husband got the \"normal\" cheese steak, and my kids got two different subs (though we call them hoagie. Haha). No complaints whatsoever. I'm glad we stopped in before visiting the Hoover dam."}
{"text":"I had just picked up a friend from the airport who was hungry for food.  The problem is that she is vegan, and it was 11pm.  Where to go?  I typed in vegan to Yelp and Capriottis popped up, so I figured we'd give it a try since it's cheap.

Now I've had the Bobby a million times and love Capriotti's, but this review is about this particular visit.  My friend asked about vegan sandwiches, and the guy working the counter said the veggie Philly cheese steak was vegan if you don't get the cheese.  So she ordered it.

After a bit of a wait, we discovered they made a regular Philly cheese steak, which I had a bit of since they were just going to throw it away.  When they finally made her vegan version, she tried it and wasn't convinced that it wasn't actual chicken.  He said it indeed was, but I agree that it looked and tasted an awful lot like chicken.  Was it or wasn't it?  We'll never know."}
{"text":"Closes earlier than posted hours! They stop taking phone and Internet orders more than 30 minutes before close. On more than one occasion their menu is incorrect and they run out of vegetarian items a lot. :("}
{"text":"Oh Capriotti's how I love that you have saved me from middle of the night hunger. After long nights of partying in Vegas, this location has taken good care of me. The area can be a little sketch but I have really never felt unsafe. (Just stay more aware) I have regularly seen security patrolling the parking lot also. Their bread is my favorite. This most recent time I had the Italian meat sub. I should have asked for more lettuce as there wasn't a lot on there and I really love lettuce. But, no biggie. Also, do note the sizes of their subs. A small is 9 inches! This makes a large enough for a small army. We usually end up sharing even a small unless we are ravenous. They are open 24/7 which is awesome. A lot of their sandwiches are interesting combinations. I know I will be back at some point."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon deal for my son and his roommates. Since I dont live in the area i called the shop to find out the details before purchasing the deal.  The staff was great!!!  They were very nice and answered all my questions. The boys went close to closing time  but the staff still attended to them with great services. My son said the sandwiches were great and full of meat.  I am very glad that I can purchase a deal and have someone far away utilize the service with no worries.  Therefore they deserve my 5 stars"}
{"text":"I'm staying at Green Valley Ranch Resort this weekend and have visited this Capriotti's location twice. Well, technically once. The first time I went I ordered a turkey sandwich that turned out to be saturated in mayonnaise, so I couldn't even eat it due to the inevitable nausea that would ensue. I usually order the chicken cheesesteak, but I wanted to switch it up...and that was a mistake on my part. I went to see a show and came back to the hotel around midnite, next to Fatburger--Capriotti's was the only place still open. I decided to give them a second chance and order my usual sandwich, but the guy at the counter said they decided to close early tonight, even though the open sign was still on, and no explanation was given aside from...come back tomorrow. They're so full of shit!"}
{"text":"I had to jump on Yelp and review Capriottie's cause I had 3 people say hello and ask me how my day was going! very rare and much appreciated!  They also said Thank-you for coming in as u got my sandwich! 
Thanks guys and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Capriotti's and eat outside so hubby ordered for us. He loved the chicken cheese steak sandwich which was loaded with meat. I had the meatball sub which was too bready (meaning the bread overwhelmed the meatballs). It was great that they offered 3 different size sandwiches, and the place is clean and nice."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich chains in Vegas. I always get the Capastrami. Love cole slaw on my sandwiches, so this one works for me. Have tried the Bobbie and the cheese steak. Both are good, but hands down the winner is the Capastrami. The 20 inch is huge, but what I can't eat I take for lunch the next day. Friendly service with a smile. When you put tips in the tip jar, someone yells \"beer money!\" Although everyone working there is not 21, it is still funny."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!  The sandwiches are not only amazing but so is the SERVICE!  They really put their customers 1st! I recommend this place to everyone.  My friends and I all enjoyed our food.  Kelly helped us and we LOVED her.  Enjoy your food and time here.  We wish we lived closer to get food all the time here.  Don't worry Kelly we will be back the next time in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Super slow service. I have been waiting about 20 min along with 3-4 other people. There are 4 people working so I'm not sure what the delay is. A lady just left that waited 35 min. The last 3 times I have been here it has been this way. Pretty hard on a lunch break."}
{"text":"Favorite sandwich spot. Not one sandwich I didn't like.. clean fast and friendly location."}
{"text":"Where's the beef?

I've been eating Capriottis for years, when the only store was on Sahara.  My two faves are the mushroom cheesesteak and the meatball with provolone.  

On my last two visits, I was disappointed to find far less meat than I had been accustomed to.  Cost cutting?  Bad economy?  Oversight?  I'm knocking a star off for that.  Whatever the reason, the sandwiches were still tasty as ever.  Hopefully they won't skimp next time."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are great but both times the service hasn't been good... Kinda leaves a bad taste."}
{"text":"VEGANS, BEWARE! 

When I first started going here I asked specific questions about the \"veggie\" meat, Was it Vegan? Did it contain any dairy or egg? etc. 
I was assured that it was absolutely vegan and a 100% soy product. 

I recently heard that their \"veggie\" meat contained egg whites. 
I called up and asked them to please look at the ingredient list to verify this and sure it enough it contained Egg Whites!! 

I am so upset that that the owner/manager of this shop was so ignorant  that he could profess the vegan wonders of this \"veggie\" meat to me knowing that it was not. 

I'm appalled by the false pretense and all the times I ate here unknowingly putting things in my body which are not OK with me. 
What if I had been deathly allergic to eggs?"}
{"text":"I called in ahead of time to order our large sub so it would be ready when we got there upon arriving they told us they never received our order. To make sure we didn't call the wrong location we called the number I had just ordered from and the store we were just in answered so we walked back in and asked them to make out large hoagie. When it was finally ready they said they didn't have a large so they just made two smalls... Thanks for asking if that was ok. Worst caps experience! I'm still amazed that they could lose out order after they asked for a name and a call back number"}
{"text":"Great sammiches a short drive from the Strip. Get away from the ding-ding-ding whirr whirr whoop whoop and just have a dang sandwich. I guess this place is part of a chain but it kicks butt over Subway or Quizno's while being in the same milieu. 

Be warned that the large sandwich is incredibly large. My 19 year old son and I split a SlawBeJo which was piled with outstanding roast beef and slathered in thick, tasty cole slaw. As soon as it arrived, we just laughed. We were not possibly going to be able to eat the thing. Leftovers, baby.

Our friend had a vegetarian thing and liked it. Great, friendly service. Lots of locals. No Keno. Go!"}
{"text":"If I were only reviewing my sandwich, it would be five stars.  If it were only about my husband's sandwich, it would be three stars.

I got the capastrami, and it was WONDERFUL! A warm sandwich with a perfect combination of pastrami, swiss cheese, coleslaw, and Russian dressing.  Every taste came out, the warmth was perfect, the bread soft.  I really enjoyed this sandwich.

My husband ordered the Bobbie, which is very highly rated, but it was a bit flat.  Not a lot of flavor.  And it was cold.  And a little dry.  Perhaps if it was warmed up it would have been a little better.

So...if you're in the mood for a pastrami sandwich, this is the place!!"}
{"text":"It was good, not great. I got the Philly cheese steak.
Major fail.. my bread wasn't toasted. was it suppose to be idk. I just thought that it was an automatic.. So, my bread was a little soggy. 
Decent size 9 in for the price but it was not steak it was ground beef.. also.. not happy with that. Will i be back for this, i will not. Will i give it another shot for another sandwhich type, why not."}
{"text":"Good good good...had the veg cheese burger loaded with everything.  Yuuuuum, will return!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a Bobbie & an Italian sub for dinner & was not disappointed! Very great tasting subs! Always a winner with the kids too!!"}
{"text":"Grabbed soup & free bread from the RJC location & had really quick service! Impressed!! Will be back next Jury Duty day or some other time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"i just found this place closed to my work and i already tried so many times with their cheese stake sandwich and the BBQ chicken salad. Staff is very nice and place is not that clean compare to other sandwich joints. i just in and out i am not really concern about cleaning"}
{"text":"The Bobbie. 'nuff said. (Although they SHOULD turn down the a/c for folks eating there...)"}
{"text":"Placed an online order for 4 sandwiches and that part was pretty easy. Pleased with the online order experience. I get there and there are already 3 people waiting for their orders. 2 workers are working pretty heavily. My sandwich I ordered was the Capastrami 9inch. I ordered cole slaw on the side, changed the Swiss cheese to provolone cheese, asked for light mayo, and add pickles. I get the sandwich home and no pickles, no mayo, no cheese, and no cole slaw on the side. So disappointed. The two workers were very nice but why bother having special instructions if they are not going to be followed. $32 in sandwiches and a free drink with Yelp check in."}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews on Yelp, but I felt the need to write a review specifically for this Capriotti's location. I'm a Capriotti's regular, and I usually go to the one in Southern Highlands. Although, I recently stopped by this location after leaving my boyfriend's house. And let me tell you.. there's something specifically great and homey about this shop. 

The customer service is beyond fantastic, every worker looks glad to be there. This one very sweet and funny young man by the name of Ron(?) took my order and made my cheesesteak, in such a quick fashion, it was perfect! I asked for his name to give a good review... I just wish the survey wasn't so long! I hope this review helps him and this store out... truly the best Capriotti's location I've been at yet! I will definitley be a returning customer."}
{"text":"After a day trip to Death Valley, I needed to make a quick stop and get something for my wife for dinner.  I live close by to this Capriotti's so I opted for a stop here.  I have never been to a Capriotti's before so the sandwiches and operations were foreign to me.

There was a short line but I soon got to the front.  I ordered a small Capastrami.  The person at the register was polite and knowledgeable.  

I took a seat and waited as I saw the people who ordered in front of me get their sandwiches.  After a short wait, my name was called, I retrieved the sandwich, and I was home in less than 5 minutes.

My wife gave the sandwich her approval but she prefers her tried and true at a different sandwich place.  I'll have to give it a try again and see if there's a different item on the menu that she'd like better."}
{"text":"Great place, fast friendly service. Subs were great, cheese evenly distributed and meat seasoned well just the way a sub should be! Highly recommend coming here to get a bite eat!!"}
{"text":"Been going here every few months or so, their large is HUGE! Like it's freaking 20 inches for less than $14; how can you go wrong w/ that? And it's actually quite good...obviously you cheesesteak connoisseur wannabees would be beg to differ-comparing it to places from Phily-but whatever, it's affordable and I think it's delicious, plain and simple and they're always nice too."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, great service.  The guys that work here are super nice, and make the sandwiches fast.  The Capistrami has been my favorite.  I liked the Bobbie and the Cheese Steak with everything was excellent as well.  Eat with confidence."}
{"text":"Solid subs.  Definitely the Bobbie delivers.  Can't go wrong with turkey and stuffing.  Friendly service.  It's a sub shop.  What more can you expect or want?"}
{"text":"For a sandwich this place isn't bad but nothing to rave over. I may have ordered the wrong thing but I wasn't way impressed. I felt like I was eating a normal turkey sandwich that my mom made. There were other items that looked good and so I would give it another try!"}
{"text":"I thought I had found the solution to ordering the Cap's Creation salad. For a year and a half they seemed to like it okay so long as I was ordering all the toppings *except for one.* No major problems in all this time. Until today. 
I asked three times for the salad with everything but hot peppers. But he kept on asking, \"Do you want onions with that?\" Everything but the hot peppers. \"Do you want dressing?\" Everything but the hot peppers. He seemed offended when, after the third time repeating myself, I asked if that was an acceptable order. He assured me that it was but he still wanted to argue about it. So, I gave up and left. 
If, like me, you like all the toppings, it seems you still must choose at least two to leave out before they will accept your order without a big argument. I have absolutely no idea why."}
{"text":"I posted 2 highly critical reviews about the dummies who run the Capriotti's on E. Flamingo so it's only fair that I say how very much better I like this location. The staff are always friendly and competent (not so the other location) and the food is, of course, terrific. 
I might be developing an addiction to their cheese steak sandwiches. Yum! 
Stay away from the big fast food chains. They're bad for you, bad for everybody. Capriotti's is so much better. Real food."}
{"text":"There are only two negatives: 1. It costs too much 2. The wait can be kind of long.

Alright, now forget all that and go to Capriotti's anyway. Get The Bobbie and/or the Capastrami. I like going with my boyfriend and swapping half so I can have some of both. Don't like turkey? Doesn't matter. Don't like cranberries? Doesn't matter. I hate cranberries and I very rarely eat turkey (like every other Thanksgiving). The Bobbie is one of the best subs I've ever had. It tastes like just like the perfect Thanksgiving dinner (minus the booze and the family fighting). When I first discovered Capriotti's I came here every few weeks. Unfortunately, that was too often for me. The sub is a too rich and filling to consume frequently, in my opinion. I do make sure to come here at least three or so times a year. 

Word of the wise, if you aren't going to your family's for Thanksgiving don't make the awesome plan of coming here for dinner and getting Culver's pumpkin shakes for dessert. The idea may sound like the best thing ever, but Capriotti's isn't open and you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are alright.  Where this place really seems to hurt is behind the counter.  
Every time I go in, it seems to be staffed with badly shaven, slightly confused, (if not stoned) guys in dirty shirts that have to be walked through the order.  
Typical experience...that JUST happened 12 minutes ago: \"Hey...whudda want?\"...\"Ok...ugh do you want lettuce tomato and onion on that?\"...checks the board...\"oh wait it doesn't have that, never mind\"...\"you wanna drink or sumpthin else?\"...then when I'm checking out, \"ugh...you didn't get a drink did you?...cool...did you pay before?\".  

Casual is fine, dirty and confused, not so great."}
{"text":"I came here on Sunday afternoon today and I received the worst experience ever here. At first the employee at the counter was nice and helpful but it wasn't after we sat down that the three females were just ranting off about other customers. After we received our order mine was wrong since I wanted wheat bread but they gave me white toast. I tried to get the workers attention but they were in the back just eating and on their phones so I had to have my friend open the door to make an alarm sound. They finally came out and I told them about the mistake and they just remade it but didn't really acknowledge it. Either way i got the correct order so I was ok but the turkey just tasted so bland and dried up for it being \"homemade\". Seems like it has been sitting out for days. The moral of the story here is I'd rather go to subway for better quality and service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy all sandwiches from this joint, but at this particular location, I'm disappointed with service.. My husband and I always order from here, especially my husband. He goes there regularly on Sundays before his shift begins. Several times my husband would not be able to go..so I take on the mission to pick his order up. Being a woman, I tend to have several errands to run, so I enjoy calling in my order ahead of time, but when I call they have the phone off the hook and it seems I get a busy signal. So by the THIRD time, I go in and there's 2 customers ahead of me. When it's my turn, I show the manger (female) my phone with number, and I ask her if this is the correct number she says yes. I dial, and I let her listen... She hears the busy signal and I explain that I have been trying to call for the last 30 minutes!! Again...this is the third time on different days.Then she says that they do it because they are to busy to answer the phone. I asked her for the owners number, but she wouldnt give it to me or take my number. So, now we have to find another place for business due to their lack of wanting to do business on the phone. Sorry you're so busy. I guess business is so good that you guys can careless of phone orders."}
{"text":"Sorry Cap! Your were off your A game today! Waited 20 minutes for an Italian sub with two sandwiches ahead of mine with three employees working. 
I requested sweet peppers with mine...I had to search to find about four pieces in my sub. 

Not good!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Close to my house. Service is hella quick and on point. Never have had a problem at this location. Some customers can be snobby because of the \"southern highlands\" area but the staff deals with them appropriately: sarcasm and a smile ."}
{"text":"All the workers seem like they were hungover and take 30 minutes to get a sandwich made wtf.

But the sandwich WAS good. haha"}
{"text":"Well we had about 6 people in our group order sandwiches... Watched 8 people order after us and get their sandwiches before any of us. Don't know what the logic in that is as I've been waiting 20 minutes for a sandwich and have watched over 10 people come and go within 5 minutes... 

Horrible."}
{"text":"I've been at a sandwich shop twice the first time was OK the second time it's like a bait and switch they are really skimpy on their meat and I would never go there again waste of money, 2 12 inch subs for about 20 bucks forget it!! That's way too much money for a sub and it's not even that great it's about a four on the scale!"}
{"text":"Best cheese steak sandwich I have ever had. Staff was very friendly and responsive. Great place to hit while you're shopping or before a movie."}
{"text":"The food is fine but the manager is out right rude, demeaning, and unkind and unprofessional. The fist time I ever called this location I placed an order. An hour later still no sandwich. They said they tried to call me but I never received a call. When I called them back to see what was going on with my order the manager read my phone number back to me so I knew they had the right number. And when I asked you questions about why it was late he said I can't talk to you and passed the phone off to his delivery guy. The delivery guy was a million times better to deal and talk with. He was helpful and nice. Maybe the delivery guy should be the manager and the manager should be the delivery guy. I like their sandwiches but I can't stand dealing with their rude manager."}
{"text":"The place is not too clean, sticky tables and chairs covered with morsels. The chicken cheese steak sandwich was ok, fresh soft bread and tasty chicken. The service is fast and friendly hence the three stars."}
{"text":"Heaven in a sandwich...at least if you're vegetarian.  They have a cheesesteak sandwich made from faux steak...it's extra especially yummy if you get the peppers and onions.  However, my favorite is the cole turkey...cole slaw, thousand island, and faux turkey equals happiness.  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime we're even near the I-10 and Chandler Blvd, we stop here and get sandwiches.  Why?  VEGGIE MEATS!!!!  They have veggie turkey, veggie hamburger and even veggie chicken.  There's nowhere else (that I know of in Phx) that you can get a deli sub made with veggie meats...especially this kind of quality.  We always order the largest size:  a whopping 20 inches, which we can usually get 2-3 meals out of.

And of course their signature subs:  the \"Bobbie\" (w/cranberry sauce, stuffing, and turkey) and the \"Cole Turkey\" (w/cheese, turkey, and cole slaw) make this the ultimate veggie sandwich shop.  YUMMY!

p.s. call ahead and order...you'll be glad you did when the line's out the door!"}
{"text":"Beer, football and an awesome sandwich. Sounds like this is heaven for a bunch of men that I know. The interior is like half Subway and half sports bar.

I've only had the veggie sub sandwiches...the veggie cole turkey is one of my favorite sub sandwiches ever, but ask for no mayo on it or the mayo in the cole slaw and the mayo and Russian dressing they put on it will over-mayo the sandwich.

I thought for awhile that the Bobbie could be made veggie, but technically, the stuffing is made with a meat broth, so nope. I suppose you could get it without the stuffing...cuz who doesn't love cranberry sauce on their fake turkey? It's definitely worth a try. Yum!

The veggie steak and cheese is good too if you're in the mood for a warm sub...definitely add the peppers to it to make the chewyness of the fake meat fade into the chewyness of the peppers. It helps, trust me.

Overall, these are great subs. If I want a sub sandwich, I come here. There's nowhere else that has good veggie meat options like these!!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered this Capriotti's not far from where I live. What a find!! The sandwiches are amazing. As a sandwich-lover, I cannot get enough of this place and have since tried most of the options on the menu. I think the best is the roast beef - pulled instead of sliced like at most sandwich places.

The sandwiches are made-to-order, so it can take a little longer than other sub shops, like Subway, but it is well worth it. You still get a pretty full array of options on the sandwich, it just isn't in an assembly line. They don't have many sides (only an atypical selection of potato chips), so you go here just for the sandwiches. Also, it's more of a take-away place. They do have a small bar and one table where you could dine-in if you really wanted to, but there's no atmosphere. It's basically just a deli counter.

Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was delicious. I thought this was a small business but i learned it is a pretty big corporation. No problem, it was better than expected. I will probably go back."}
{"text":"This place has a great menu, but they need to lighten up on the dressing. It was overwhelming how much thousand island they put on my small sub, like half a bottles worth. Whoa. I wiped some of the dressing off and realized this place is a bit overrated."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches which taste even better than the 8 million pictures on Yelp. I got the bobbie and the capastrami. 

I love sandwiches, everyone loves sandwiches. These sandwiches are huge and full of flavor. I'm going to offend some people and say these sandwiches are the best in Las Vegas... yes, even better than Earl of Sandwiches. You get way more for your money. I'll be trying the rest of their sandwiches next time i'm in town. 

This is a another must try spot if you are visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and very friendly staff. I had the grilled Italian sandwich and it was spot on! We will definitely come here again.
Racquel M."}
{"text":"I dream about the Capastrami's; they are one of the best sandwiches ever invented.

My kids like to go to the Red Rock food court before a game of bowling and they get Fat Burger; I enjoy a tasty Capastrami."}
{"text":"My favorite sub shop... I love the capastrami sub.. My wife enjoys the Bobby it's like Thanksgiving on a sub.. The employees are always having a good time there.. Make sure to leave a tip for BEER MONEY!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I stop into vegas (which is quite often) I have to have a Capastrami....it's that GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!!!"}
{"text":"Will never go to a Subway, Jersey Mike's or any other sandwich spot when Capriotti's is an option.  I've had a few different sandwiches but the Bobby is as good as advertised and my favorite.  At this Silverado & LV BLVD location, the staff is always friendly and working fast."}
{"text":"I look forward to eating here every time I come to Las Vegas. I got the 20\" cheesesteak, a 12\" bobbie for the wife and a grilled cheese for the boy. I receive friendly service and would recommend this place to out-of-towners like me who get tired of eating at their hotel restaurants."}
{"text":"I went in directly after work. Used my tips from my job to have  good dinner. 

I had the best sandwich that I've ever received in my entire life. 

Shout out to all the crew 

My bread was soft. My sandwich had the best amount of cheese. 

10/10 would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Just came in to an amazing greeting, adorable cashier & a nice clean lobby! I am in love with this location. Keep up the good work you guys!!!"}
{"text":"Lets just take a look at the picture that pops up on yelp for this place!!! Can I please put extra stars! I need a Bobbie in my life right now! This is a must when I am around one as I do not live near one but don't mind making a drive.  

Ok so you have to try the Bobbie when you first go here, it will totally blow your mind and keep you coming back. Just don't let that keep you from trying other sandwiches they make as they are all exceptionally good and of course I want to make sure they don't run out of making mine if I am behind you!!

The staff here is friendly, fast and just plain awesome at taking your order and getting you fat and happy! The prices are very fair for a sandwich shop and if your smart take a friend and get the 20\" and split it! 6\" is always too small of a sandwich for me and 12\" leaves me waddling out the door, so with the split option you each get 10\" of pure amazingness. 

The shop is always clean inside and there is plenty of seating and this location has a T.V. so you can watch the game if your into that while your eating. The drink choices are normal just your average fountain options plus they have a few bottled options of newer drinks. 

Thats all I pretty much have to say about Capriotti's, but just writing this review I am going to find my nearest location or heck find the next flight to vegas to have another sandwich this second! So if your hungry and want a sandwich shop this is the spot and I will see you there!!"}
{"text":"I heart Capriotti's!!  I wish they opened one here in the bay.  

Ultimate Faves:

Capastrami  - A pastrami sandwich with their russian dressing AND... coleslaw!!! Trust, it's what makes it gooood.

The Bobbie - A hand-held Thanksgiving dinner.  Turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce. 

SlawBeJo - Roast beef, that russian dressing again and coleslaw. MMMmmm...

Now, if I can have these sandwiches with Little Lucca's garlic spread...  I'd be the happppiest person alive!!"}
{"text":"For anyone who's a fan of Subway, Jimmy John's, Port O Subs, or any other deli, you've missed out! Capriotti's blows them all away! Now this location is not the largest, cleanest, or friendliest, but the food is outstanding! The bread is so amazingly fresh, and so are the contents for which it holds! The Bobby is there most famous sandwich and without question its their best! It's a turkey (slabs, not the thin deli meat) with homemade dressing and cranberry sauce! Thanksgiving stuffed into fresh bread! I also tried their pastrami with melted cheese, cole slaw, and Russian dressing! Holla! You'll certainly come away thinking that the other deli chains all seem kinda phony with their ingredients! This southern gentleman wishes the East Coast had them as readily available as they are out West!"}
{"text":"If you can't wait for Thanksgiving like me, Capriotti's Bobbie sandwich will more than appease your cravings!  The Bobbie consists of shredded white turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayonaise and I heard it's even better with jalapenos.  Another plus for this place is their cheap pricing.  For $7 you can get a 9-inch sub, which is definitely worth your money because it's huge and packed with meat and stuffing.  Every time I've got a sandwich here, there are usually leftovers for later.  This place is definitely my FAVORITE deli in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"So, I have been to this location a couple times and I can say I have had ok experiences when I have come in, except for this last time. I went in to order 2 sandwiches and when I walked in I was greeted halfheartedly which doesn't usually bother me, I placed my order and I usually always throw a couple dollars in the tip jar to ensure they make my order as requested and because I was in service industry, however, on this visit I had no cash so I put the tip on my card. As I was standing with my back to the cooks, but facing the windows where I can see the cooks reflection, I saw one of the cooks go up to the guy I placed my order with and ask if I had tipped or not and I saw the guy I placed my order with say no. WTF?? So what if I didn't tip were they going to do something to my food? Make it wrong? Why ask that? Not to mention one of the cooks had dreadlocks and he wasn't wearing a hair net...gross....So, I walked over to the cash register and the guy I placed my order with came over and I played stupid but I got my point across I asked him, \"So, if I put a tip on my card you guys get the tip correct? \" and he knew he was busted because he just looked at me with a blank stare and mumbled , \"Yea\" and I just nodded and he announced in an annoyed voice that they had been given beer money for the rest of the staff. I watched them make my food and walked out and swore I would never go back. 

Food is meh and prices are high so I'm really not missing much and I don't have to worry about my food preparation in other fast food places if I don't tip."}
{"text":"I go in the have the \"signature sandwich,\" The Bobbie, and they're out of stuffing, of their most popular sandwich? The woman was nice and offered to make make one, without the stuffing for free. Pass."}
{"text":"Meh.  The sandwiches are not bad, but not exactly inspiring in the flavor department.  I do like that they have vegetarian meat options (most places think a cheese sandwich is enough), but I wouldn't make a special trip here for them.  I've started to notice a trend among underwhelming restaurants...they all seem to loudly proclaim how amazing they are.  USA Today voted you one of the top 10 greatest paces for a sandwich?  Really?!

Edit:
\"CRAPiottis\"  Why didn't I think of that for my first review??"}
{"text":"Truly.....  

The shortest review ever.....

One word........

Capistrami!!!  

Be sure to get it with extra sauce!!!  Also get the BIG one just in case you want more!!!

It's their Vegas location... can't go wrong with it!

mmmmm..... that was a delicious late breakfast!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from LA. Nothing will ever compare to Johnny Pastrami but this satisfies me pretty good until then. Husband gets the Capastrami, which i have to admit looked AMAZING. However I wanted a regular Hot Pastrami, not on the menu but they made it for me. :) Enough of each sauce, pickles and $20 for 2 medium (footlong) subs. We eat here about once a month for our Pastrami cravings, no complaints. YUM."}
{"text":"Terrible experience at this Silverado Ranch location.  Our Bobby sandwich did not have any stuffing in it...see photo. When we finally realized why the sandwich tasted funky...like it was missing something, we complained to the guy that made it/gave it to us (taller, slim, thin black mustache guy).  He then handed us the correct sandwich.  He knew we we had a bad sandwich all along but he wasn't about to tell us!!!  What a great way to piss off two former regular customers.  Goodbye Capriotti's."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are very good but not a whole lot of variety.  We were working at the convention center for a trade show and we decided to place an order so we didn't have to stand in the long lines at the cafeteria area. First off, it took me calling 3 times to finally get through.  The girl on the line was friendly and I know she took the order right because she repeated it back to me. Second, she did mentioned that it would be an hour and a half before they could deliver. No problem, 1:30 pm perfect timing or so I thought.  Not only did they mess up on the order but we didn't get the order til 2:15 pm. By that time we were all getting hangry. Yes, I said hangry. Working the show and being on your feet for 8 hours is no joke and the last thing you want to do is to wait a long time for food. Plus, I waited 45 minutes outside for the delivery. I don't think we'll be using them again. Next time, I'll just take an uber to get us lunch.  The 3 star rating, sandwiches were good but the service and delivery were horrible."}
{"text":"Try the Bobbie and tell me you don't suddenly get the strange urge to start preparing a shopping list for Black Friday. It really is a reminder of all the yummy goodness that is Thanksgiving.  I also tried the philly chicken, which was just as good.  You definitely don't need to do a large, unless you're a fat-azz like I me.  It's good stuff."}
{"text":"This isn't your other Capriotti's, same name, same menu, different assembly, bad outcome. Typically, steak and cheese is dynamite, here it's less than so-so, dry contents, crumbly bread, and they don't toast the bread \"unless you ask\" so dont assume they are going for the best sandwich if it takes extra effort."}
{"text":"Stopped by after work and was pleasantly surprised by the service. The two gentlemen behind the counter provided excellent customer service. 

Although my sandwich did take a little longer to make then I liked, they did offer me a free drink for the wait."}
{"text":"Since 1983 I've been going to Capriotti's in Las Vegas and I don't recall ever being disappointed. I've probably had everything on the menu since then, I've watched them expand all over the valley as the city itself grew too. The thing about coming here for me is the memories it reminds me of, conversations of days long past. Simply eating of the sandwiches may bring back a memory of high school, my family when the kids were younger or sometimes just spark a memory of good food with good friends.

I like this location too. Always friendly on polite and the atmosphere is great during lunch. Today I came because all week I was thinking of having a Bobbie, I came in, ordered and ate one....I wasn't disappointed either...

Thanks Cap!!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be great, until there was a change in staff. These people don't know how to make sandwiches. They always use way too much hot peppers (and I love spicy). They add onions even when you say no onions. They NEVER answer their phone. It's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Eh. The guy that made my sandwich had some customer service skills. Can't say that about the lady who took my order. She was rude, shouldn't be helping people. Isn't facial jewelry against sanitation laws? She had a bull horn in her nose. I hope it doesn't fall into anyone's sandwich."}
{"text":"I came here a while back and they were out of bread and it sucked but I laughed off the ridiculous irony of a sandwich shop missing a main ingredient. Today however was THE last straw. I missed thanksgiving and knew I was gonna but I haven't been worried about a turkey fix because I live behind this place and they have The Bobby....I was just informed they're OUT of turkey...I wanted to flip out and tell the lady to go home and bring me her fekn leftovers! I'm so pissed and now I have to walk to albertsons! Aaaaahhhhh FML"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The quality in the sandwiches are top notch.  Everything is fresh and nothing has failed me.  Every sandwich is super tasty and filling."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ordered the Capastrami (hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and cole slaw)  and the SlawBeJo (Homemade roast beef, provolone cheese, Russian dressing, cole slaw, and mayo) to share. 

We have a love for pastrami subs, but overall, we ended up liking the SlawBeJo more. 

The pastrami they served us seemed chopped up as opposed to giving us whole slices... That weirded me out a little. 

The roast beef was cold. It was dry, but the cole slaw helped the flavor. Over all, we thought it had more flavor than the pastrami. I think the cole slaw was a better pair to the roast beef than the pastrami."}
{"text":"Most of the Capriotti's around town have weird staff in my opinion. Weird as in they range from seeming careless, a little rude, and unfriendly.

I'm glad the closest Capriotti's is not like that. I love the staff here. They're very formal and friendly. That's the only reason I decided to write a review.

I am from Vegas so I love Capriotti's because the sandwiches are so good. Vegas isn't known for any specific sandwich. Like I'm not from philly so the cheese steak is the best I've ever had. 

I think the prices are affordable and they have a wide variety of flavors.

My favorites are 

The cheesesteak with hot and sweet peppers.
 The Bobbie of course but I have to be in the mood for it.
The capastrami with the Russian dressing is also delicious."}
{"text":"We got a 20\" sub packed with meat and vegetables for $12. What a deal! But if we knew they put coleslaw in the pastrami sandwich we wouldn't have ordered it. It just didn't taste right. I love pastrami sandwiches and am used to having it with fresh vegges and mustard. Though pricing was good, taste wise this was the worst pastrami sandwich I've had."}
{"text":"My favorite location! We all know these sandwich are \"the bomb\", but let's face it, it is a franchise and the quality varies with location. I don't know about you but I get totally bummed when my Cole turkey sub is dry! This location tends more in the other direction and I'll take it! Look I don't love my sandwich to be soggy, which did happened once, but dry makes this sandwich a waste. Only once have I had it on the soggy side but it wasn't ruined. The bread was soggy on one end, no real big deal. 
My fiance always ordered the pastrami and is never disappointed by this location as well. 
Good service always timely and I often use an ordering service to get my subs delivered when I have too much going on.
Great place and I highly recommend this franchise and above that this location."}
{"text":"Slow service. People in the kitchen were swearing. Kinda smelled like weed and old mops. Never going back."}
{"text":"Amazing Philly and The Capastrami is one of the best sandwiches, if you like pastrami then you need to get one ASAP!"}
{"text":"This chain sandwich shop never fails me whenever I'm in LV.  Regardless of location the taste is always the same and so delightful.  

I ventured off and tried the meat ball sub this time.  It was good but my favorite is still the Bobbie or the chicken steak.  

Plus the red velvet bundt cake is delicious."}
{"text":"Came back and tried the beef steak sandwich and chicken steak sandwich which were also delicious.  

Best of all they have a really good red velvet bundt cake.  You would think that bundt cakes are usually dry, but this was the best I've ever had.  It was perfectly moist and the flavor of red velvet was just the right sweetness with a few pieces of hidden chocolate chips on the inside that melts in your mouth goodness.  Such a sin to eat the whole cake yourself but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Ah one of the most consistent chains I've been to.  Always have to go to a Capriottis when i'm in Vegas.  No matter which location I go to, the sandwiches taste same.  Favorites are the Bobbie, and the Cheese steak with everything."}
{"text":"Slowest service at any Capriotti's.  Nice décor.  Clean and new.  Love the location.  Perhaps I'll give them another try, but they need to work out the kinks on this location."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are huge!!!! We all ordered a small and had leftovers for the next days lunch!!! My hubby and I ordered the Italian, one was hot and the other cold.  I liked the cold one and my husband liked the hot one.  I usually like hot sandwiches with the onions grilled but I just like the flavor of the cold one better.  My girls got the ham and cheese cold and the picky eaters ate it!!!  I will be back next time I'm in Vegas so I can try the roast beef or the Capastrami."}
{"text":"I still love Capriotti's, but the employees at this location has been slacking lately. 

In the past, as soon as I walked through the door I was greeted, usually by multiple employees. On the last few visits, there have been multiple employees behind the counter, but the majority seem to be socializing with each other rather than actually working. 

I recently called in an order, picked it up and realized when I got home that I had been given (and charged  the higher price for) the wrong sandwich.

Annoyed, I went back to get the correct sandwich. The guy that helped me was apologetic... but I expected more for the trouble then being offered a free bag of chips, particularly when I had been overcharged. 

It sucks that the employees here aren't trained to provide better customer service, because I really like the food. I go to another Capriotti's location near my work for lunch from time to time, and never have problems with the employees"}
{"text":"Capriottis makes excellent sandwiches, not many people will deny this. I am a huge fan of the Bobbie, and have stole enough bites of the standard turkey sandwich from my husband to be a fan of that as well. 

I was out running an errand in the same area of this Capriotti's, so I called in an order to take back to work with me. In the mood for something different, I ordered a small tuna sandwich. 

When I arrived, there was quite a few customers waiting for their sandwiches so I was worried about there being a wait. I stood at the cash register for a while before I was acknowledged, despite there being a female employee wrapping sandwiches at the counter just a couple feet away. She looked over a few times but that was it. Another employee came from the back to ring me up for a small turkey sandwich. He didn't hear my order correctly over the phone, probably because of the loud music that was playing in the store. 

They were able to remake my sandwich correctly pretty quickly, and taste-wise, it did not disappoint. Next time, I will probably order from my usual Capriotti's location though."}
{"text":"When this Capriottis first opened, I was pleased to have a location closer to home. Sadly, location is the only thing this place has going for it.

Every single time I try to get food here I am disappointed, annoyed or both. At first, I chalked up the often shoddy service to a lack of experience by the staff. This location has been open a year now, to me that is ample time to get the crew up to speed. 

I always take my food from  Caps to go, and I have learned the hard way to ALWAYS triple check my order before leaving. Even when I correct the cashier multiple times about what I want on my sandwich (no mayo, add mustard, how hard is that?), my food is often incorrect.

My biggest pet peeve with this location is their unwillingness to allow changes to their salads. The Capriottis website lists a salad called Cap's Creation where you get to select your own toppings. I have ordered this multiple times from other locations,  but I am always told no when I try to get it here. Salads are made fresh to order, so I don't understand why customization is not allowed. 

From now on, when I am craving a Bobbie or anything else from Capriotti's, and especially if I am craving a salad, I will drive a little further to go to another location."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! BIt's a great atmosphere and one of those special places you just have to hit!  It's right in the heart of downtown and always has a crowd. You have to try their famous Bobbie!  It truly is the best of thanksgiving dinner, minus the sweet potato pie!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Capriotti's and still think that they have some of the best cheese steaks in Las Vegas.  This particular Cap is located in North Las Vegas in the Home Depot shopping center.  It's a small restuarant with limited tables/chairs inside and a few more outside.  

Cap sells their sandwiches in 3 sizes; 9 inch, 12 inch, and their monster 20 inch.  I have friends that recommend the Bobbi (turkey and cranberry) and their Capastrami (their pastrami swiss).  I am told both these sandwiches are really good.  However, I've yet to try either.  I've only tried two different subs here; they're steak/cheese and chicken/cheese.  Both meats are thinly sliced, seasoned, and coated in melted cheese.  I usually have both sandwiches plain so that I can savor the meats more.  You can't go wrong with either sandwich.  Simply state, both are delicious. 

Service is not bad at all and really depends on how busy they are.  Between 11:30 AM and 1 PM, this place can be a madhouse.  Cap is little more pricey compared to say 
Subway, but the food here is much better."}
{"text":"Ok fellow yelpers....show your check in yelp free drink before you pay.

Still bitter they didn't honor the free drink because I was two seconds too late.

Order in the order line, pay in the pay line...you would think its obvious but no joke people were waiting 10 people ahead before learning they were in the wrong line.

For the actual review: The sandwiches are consistently delicious. Capistrami is my favorite. Something about the Russian slaw paired with the pastrami here is so perfect. A little bit of sweet and savory wrapped in a bun. yum.... My hubby loves the cheesesteak and claims it was the best meal in Red Rock. Sandwiches were $8-$9 so pricey for a sandwich.

Moral of the review: it's a little pricey but a worthwhile meal as long as you pay AFTER you show your yelp deal"}
{"text":"First time here around lunch time and ordered a cappastrami. Took about 5-10min to get our sandwich and it was DELICIOUS! We are probably the lucky ones to give this place a 5 star because the meal was good, customer service was great and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Was told this place was awesome and it is.

Bread is perfect. Meats are high quality and the prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you get. 

My fave is the capastrami as its a perfect blend of sweet sauce and spicey pastrami. I didnt coleslaw on a sandwich would be good but boy I love slaw anyways and it blended everything together perfectly.

I'd suggest to friends and I have so I figured id suggest to all of yelp aswell."}
{"text":"I have to agree with a few others here.  The service and food was excellent.  The shop is very clean and the sandwiches were made perfectly.   

As a long-time fan of this chain, this location is one of the best for sure.

I'll be back for sure to get my fix."}
{"text":"I didnt try the Bobby. I got roast beef and cheese with LTO. Amount of meat was dwarfed by the bread and overall quality was somewhere below subway. I wasnt expecting much but it wasnt worth finishing. Ended up going to McDonalds which is pretty sad. 2 stars is generous from me but maybe they had an off day."}
{"text":"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! I've been here 4-5 times in the last few months and always try a new sandwich. No matter what I get, it's been so good! I used to love subway, but this place in my opinion is way better! Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"i love capriottis, always have. sometimes this location has shitty phone service. my foods always on point though, and i never wait more than 5-10 minutes for my sub. i love the bobbi and the capastrami. i just got the bobbi today, its overloaded in the best possible way. so to the staff friday, 4/15, @ 4pm..... i love you"}
{"text":"One star is one Star too many....   I placed a simple Sandwich order and a Cap's Chopped a bag of chips and a drink.  As you know this location is at Town Square so it's not a convenient location to go to, between looking for parking and then getting to the location.  I get my order and head back to the office, when I sit down to eat I realized that the salad is just a plain green salad....   I now have to go back and get what I paid for then as I look at the receipt I see I've been overcharged for a \"capture 2\"?  Had no idea what this was.  As I head back to the location I asked that they correct my salad and for my troubles I ordered a Large Steak & cheese sandwich.  The young man at the register calls the manager out to assist me.  As I explain to him the situation he proceeds to tell me that he cannot give me a $20.00 sandwich for my troubles but he would do \"something\", he also proceeds to go to the cashier who rang me up to confirm that she took the order...  why?   Was I lying to you??????   So then he explains to me that she's been doing good and has only been there for a month.  What does that matter?!?!?!  I never complained on her and I know people make mistakes.   It was not about her it was about the managers attitude and approach.   I asked for a refund so I could be on my way because if I'm going to be troubled I would like to be compensated accordingly.  The manager did not see it that way.......  where are your CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS!?!???"}
{"text":"My 1st time ever eating at a capriottis     The staff is so friendly and the place is spotless 

Roxanne was so nice.   She recommended the Bobby it was actually a great sandwich I'll definitely be back 7"}
{"text":"Ok... Where to begin... I tried the Bobbie. They tout this as voted best sandwich in America. I was very apprehensive about ordering it as I am not a fan of pooberries (cranberries).

Freaking delicious. It's like having a thanksgiving party in my mouth. It's happening right now.. I'm chewing and typing.... There is a festival in that sandwich and I recommend it to any and all. 

Turkey freshly roasted everyday. That makes the biggest difference. Wow... I'm still eating and loving it.

Enjoy..."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed! Huge sandwiches for very reasonable prices. I feel like the Bobbie was created for me- turkey, stuffing, cranberries, and mayo. It's definitely a nap waiting to happen, but so delicious! The mayo adds that extra little touch.

Cheesesteaks are also fantastic, chicken or steak. It's the real deal, so be prepared to wait a little longer for one of these.

If you order anything other than a small, be prepared to have a second meal later. 

This place hides in a strip mall near the Brazilian Bull and Dunkin Donuts. Saving the 5th star because a place like this really needs to either stay open late or deliver for those sudden turkey cravings!"}
{"text":"Service has always been good when I visit here. Tonight's visit was just as good. The GM over heard me tell my little we'll share sandwiches being she never eats all her food and he suggested I get a cup of meat and a few slices of cheese. That was the perfect suggestion...my little girl loves it!
Thank you for the great service and suggestion!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches on earth!!!!!! I love this place they are always so nice and always put care into every order. You feel welcomed a d very satisfied when you leave."}
{"text":"Loved my sandwich here.  I went with the house special.  It did not disappoint.  Ate at the location just off the north end of the strip."}
{"text":"I've never witnessed such a hard working group of folks; (honorable mention) the little blonde chick that helped me out with a platter 'o sandwiches. She's a doll and an all around cool chick, ya hear?! The sandwiches are what they are, good as all get out, but it's the people that work there that made my experience great as all get out."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh... biggest \"small\" sandwich ever! I ordered a small sub sandwich, which turns out is 9 inches! A small!! I was more than full when I finished... and I couldn't even put down the whole sandwich. The staff was super friendly and made our sandwiches to order. Yup, I'll be going again soon."}
{"text":"While it was my first time in THIS location, I've been coming to lots of different Cap's locations over the years, never had a problem. And the nice part about about Cap's is the service is always super friendly. Not at this one. Walked in, no greeting, no instruction where to order from, nothing. To make it worse, it's not as if they were busy the large white fella, and the Latin girl were literally just standing there. The large guy, with his hands firmly planted on the counter didn't  even look at us. There was a skinny white guy making sandwiches, but the other two might as well have been sitting in the dining room eating. After a while of not even being able to catch eye contact from anyone, me and my family walked out and went to the location at Horizon and College where we are now eating (after being immediately greeted by all three people working here). It appears the poor yelp rating is deserved at the Boulder and Lake Mead location. We won't be back."}
{"text":"This Capriottis is terrible.  My niece brought me a grilled Italian sandwich and the bread was so soaked with grease it disintegrated into a flour glop.  The meat was like jerky and I'm not sure what decade the veggies were from.  I guess either they can't make this item or were too busy to care.  It was the most tasteless, grease soaked sandwich. I can't believe Capriotti's has allowed their reputation to be sullied. Extremely disappointing.  Maybe it was the wrong day, I'm guessing something this bad, any day is the wrong day."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch on the way to Death Valley. Because I'm in training for Thanksgiving which is next week, I ordered the Bobbie. A soft, delicious, HUGE, sub roll (I got the 9\" small) stuffed to overflowing with turkey, cranberry sauce, homemade stuffing, and a little slather of mayo. Delightful! My hubby got the cheesesteak with fried onions and hot peppers. Spicy and very nice as well! We will be on the lookout for more Capriotti's on our travels!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop hands down! The capastrami is with out a doubt the best choice."}
{"text":"I just tried to get a sandwich at capriottis on Bethany home.  Went out of my way to get there at 7:40 on Thursday night.  The doors were locked and the employee inside saw me and barely acknowledge me being there.  Google said open until 8:00pm and the writing on the window said open until 9:00pm.  I should have known something was up when I tried calling at 7:15 to place an order for pickup and no one answered.  

If they had to close early for a reason I would understand, but to have the doors locked and see people inside deliberately ignoring me was really frustrating after a long day.  If there was a reason you had to close, just come to the door and let me know.  

The sandwiches are fine and I would change my rating, but I just want management to notice this situation, and I feel this may be the best way.   Right now I'm reluctant to come back."}
{"text":"YUMMY sandwiches are always a treat!!!  Hubby gets capistrami and I get the chix cheese steak w/mushrooms and peppers.   Both peppers!!   They are AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out. Ordered a large cheese steak for myself and my husband. While eating it, I kept biting into something crunchy. I kept spitting out burnt crispy, over cooked bits from the grill that was mixed into my sandwich. 

Not the best way to experience a sandwich that is suppose to be \"the best in America\" most definitely was a turnoff and yummy turning to bite into this nasty crispy whatever when I was hoping for delicious. Really disappointed. I thought I found a new place to but instead found a place to stay away from. 

Such a pity. $22 for a sandwich and a chip drink combo to be this. Not happy, feeling like the staff doesn't care about the quality of food served. Yuk!"}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's sandwiches, no matter what shop I've gone to the food is pretty much the same.  This one in particular is not in a casino and is seriously lacking some fung shui.  There is no order counter here, you just walk up to the edge of the kitchen to place your order and to pick it up.  If you've never been here it would be easy just to keep walking right into the kitchen.  The dinning area is tiny but they have a few tables outside.  Last time I went in there I ordered two items, and they wrote them down.  Yet somehow they failed to get it correct.  Still enjoyed them because it's Cap's and it was still good.  I wish they would make the bobbie hot though... booh-hoo"}
{"text":"Capistrami's & Bobbi's. A great place for sandwiches. Convenient and not too expensive, worth every cent. Great place. And, unlike a few of the other Cap's locations around town, this location is nice & clean."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's and I will always order my veggie cheesesteak but it was my first time at this location & it was a little disappointing. The sandwiches came out quick and the cashier was friendly but I noticed a young man stocking the tomato bin back up. The bin was nasty looking, with at least three other things that were contaminating it and the gentleman didn't take the older tomatoes out first to put them on top (to be used next/first). Gross. That's all I was able to visually see but who else knows what's going on back there....."}
{"text":"Eric took care of us and went above and beyond when we realized we didn't like our particular sandwich he swapped it out. It wasn't an issue and he showed excellent customer service. The new sandwich is much better"}
{"text":"Great service, we were Greeting coming in to the establishment and acknowledged when we left. The food was fresh and the presentation was on point. The store was clean and all three gentlemen seemed to be working amazingly together. We had not been to Cappriottis for quite some time, loved the new grab two option."}
{"text":"I don't eat this type of food often but when I do I love these sandwiches because of the roasted turkey and quality. I have eaten at three locations: Mesa, Scottsdale and 16th street. I am comparing this location to what I have received from the other locations:  there was a bone in the sandwich (very dangerous with huge liability), very stingy on the meat and loaded the Bobbie with too much stuffing; the Turkey Cole was disappointing the Cole slaw had been drained of all the dressing and was dry. That's why I get it!! I don't get it for the cabbage but the nice flavor combo of the dressings. It's ok for it to be messy. Again, very little meat and too much dry cabbage. I am a chef and I get cutting costs but never compromise the best things on your menu. Cut something else. It's unfortunate but I won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches period! The Bobbie is great, you also must try the Capastrami it's great!  Customer service is great always upbeat and friendly! And guess what they deliver! Yup that's right they deliver when you call to place your order just tell them you want it delivered and it will be sent right out! Can't get more perfect then that!"}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's... Just not this location. Dirty restaurant and employees that looked like they were hired right out of a homeless shelter."}
{"text":"Shared a medium slaw be Jo sandwich with my dad

Quick and delicious. I like the sauce 

Checkin for a free cookie/brownie!"}
{"text":"Some of the best bread I ever had and the Turkey with stuffing and cranberry sauce is amazing. Service was quicker than I could fill my cup with pop and get my napkins."}
{"text":"Vegetarians rejoice! They have a vegetarian sliced turkey sandwich, and amazingly enough it taste good! The rolls are delicious, the meats, cheeses, and toppings are always fresh, Capriotti's is one of my favorite sandwich shops.

Note to vegetarians: they also have a veggie cole turkey sandwich, a veggie philly cheese steak sandwich, and a veggie cheeseburger sandwich. YES! Choices in food, finally!!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was edible but not fantastic, which is abnormal for Capriotti's. But, the staff was super nice and friendly which goes a long way for me."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all with the Bobbie. Maybe it was poorly prepared when I tried it from this location, but it didn't have much flavor and ended up far worse than the seasonal holiday turkey sandwich at Earl of Sandwich on the Strip.

I tried the Slaw Be Jo last night. It came cold for some reason and didn't appeal to me as much as the Capastrami, Still, it's really good. Might be as little as the issue of preferring pastrami a little bit over roast beef, although the meat did seem a little dry.

Capastrami was still incredibly awesome the last time I had it.

For this particular location, place your order by phone and they'll have your sandwich ready within minutes, possibly even faster than if you place your order in person. It's worked well for me twice now. Order a large Capastrami (for the best value per inch) and share with a friend, or else fridge what you can't finish!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches!

Located along West Cheyenne and buffalo, in the easy to access strip mall next to Sasa Sushi and the gas station.

I never was a big sandwich person, but then I came to this place and it all changed. I remember a few years back eating my first Bobby and I was hooked.

A few sandwiches to try are The Bobby and the Chicken Cheese Steak. I always like the sweet peppers for the cheese steak.

Remember to check in here and you'll get a large fountain drink. Also your able to get the Nothing bunt cakes here as well. 

Over the years the service has been consistent with the roll over with staff and have had no problems whenever I've ordered. It can be quite busy sometimes so phone your order ahead before you come in.

Overall
Food: 5-5
Drink: 4-5 (free drink on check in)
Service: 4-5
Coming back: yes"}
{"text":"Capistrami!!!!! First time trying this place and it definitely won't be the last. Great service and even better food."}
{"text":"This place serves THE BEST turkey sub, period. It's their signature sub and they call it The Bobbie. I've bought many times from this location, always great subs. 

The ambience is OK (hence the 4 stars). It's made for getting a sub and getting out of there, not really setup as a sit-down restaurant, so it's alright. 

Overall, I keep coming back to this place because the service is great and the sandwiches are even better! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Hadn't had Capriotti's in a long time, and it doesn't disappoint. I only have one sandwich from them and that's their #1: The Bobby. If you like turkey sandwiches, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches, highly recommend the Bobbie, their signature / award winning turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches but closing at 8pm? Minus one star for that. So weird. Besides that, workers and quality is awesome."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a taste-bud treat go to Capriotti's! I have to tell you I don't like cranberry sauce. However the Bobbie changed my mind! Shredded turkey topped with mayo and a very generously seasoned stuffing and then cranberry sauce! It is so freaking GOOD! 

I have been using Capriotti's for quite a while for catering in my office. I have tried several different sammies from Capriotti's. Among my favorites. The Bobbie, The Slaw B Jo, The Italian & the Tuna. The Slaw B Jo is shredded roast beef, slaw, provolone cheese and Russian dressing. I like it lite on the dressing. This used to be my favorite until I tasted the Bobbie. 

I am with Devon I wish they had one in the north west. Let's see one would fit right around 43rd ave and Bethany hint hint! 

Bye the way get a large cut it in half, eat one half now and save the other for later. They are huge and it is a better deal that way. 

Anyway they make a very tasty sub. Like I said they do catering too!"}
{"text":"Capriottis was good when they first opened several years ago. They have since gone done hill! I ordered a cheesesteak and it barely had meat on it. I payed $8.11 with tax. I'll drive the extra miles to POPS and get a bigger and better cheesesteak. Sorry Capriotti's!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's is awesome! Of course they make delicious sandwiches - but just tell them you're vegan and their team will go above and beyond to be sure your 'wich never touches animal products (clean board, new gloves, fresh knives). It's so great to know that no matter where you are in Vegas there's a quick, easy and vegan friendly food option close by!"}
{"text":"I will never step foot in this Capriotti's again. They don't even have a rest room for their patrons."}
{"text":"I have to visit this place every time I'm in town!!!

I order a medium turkey sandwich with cheese, mayo, onions and seasonings. That's it! 

The turkey is roasted fresh daily. They shred it there. The bread is always fresh and tasty. 

Sometimes you'll have to wait a while for your sandwich, but let me tell you, it is worth waiting for!

By far, one of the best sandwiches in town. I wish we had them in Southern California. They put Subway and Quizno's to shame."}
{"text":"Since my last review I've been back more than 2 handfuls of times mainly cause I am in love with the food. Each time since my first review have been great and the employees are super nice and always greet you when you walk in. I'll keep coming back for more. The Italian sausage and capastromi is delicious!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their sandwiches! I am totally addicted and won't go anywhere else. Every shop I've been to has been great and the staff is always super friendly"}
{"text":"I would give them a big Fat  ZERO if I could! The service (or LACK of IT) is beyond unacceptable! If you Hate your job then quit! This is my 2nd bad experience & just had to leave a review. The 1st incident happened a couple months ago when I called to place an order over the phone & was told to hold cause they were really backed up & it was Only 2 people working, after 35 minutes I drove down to the shop & was greeted by a very frustrated young girl who just looked up to tell me that if I wanted to order it was going to take a very long time cause again \"THEY WERE STILL BACKED UP\"!!! I showed her my phone which I left on hold & was up to 46 minutes holding asked her Why She never took my order"}
{"text":"Best lil sammy shop ever. Great food. Quality ingredients. Good staff. Never too busy. Has catering. Really food place lunch or dinner. Nom nom"}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED

I had made Capriotti's a habit on my prior trips to Vegas over the course of the last 15 years whenever I felt the urge for a quick casual quality lunch or dinner. I was, therefore, pleased, when Elite Las Vegas Yelper, Christie graciously invited me to meet her and her husband, Marc for a bite at Capriotti's, during my recent Vegas vacation.

I ordered the Cole Turkey(turkey, coleslaw, provolone and Russian dressing on a hero). I bit in and loved the fresh taste of the turkey, the crispness of the cole slaw, the nicely melted cheese, the tasty soft bread and the great flavor imparted by the Russian dressing. I virtually inhaled the sandwich.It was as good, or better, than the Cheese Steak sandwiches I had eaten in the past..........And, more importantly, my experience at Capriotti's on 7/21 was made immensely more memorable because I shared it with new friends.

Capriotti's is another franchise that needs to come to lower New York."}
{"text":"Wanting a change from my usual Grand Cafe dinner this trip, and simply too tired from hours of video poker to drive out to any of the Italian restaurants I bookmarked, I opted for a quick casual dinner at this Capriotti's, a food court place I've eaten at now and then during my many trips to Vegas.I ordered a medium Cheese Steak($10.49) sub,hero, hoagie, whatever. I chose onions and sweet peppers as toppings.The counter dude asked me to repeat my order immediately after I ordered it. He looked a little too young for short term memory issues but who am I to speculate about the nature of his affliction. It was enough that he got me my huge 12 incher promptly......boy that does not sound right.....look at the picture instead.

The sandwich was delicious, hot and consumed quickly, though a little cheap on the cheese or wiz. I liked it anyway.It was filling and a great value.

t saddens me that there are no Capriotti's in Downstate New York. Is anybody out there listening?"}
{"text":"Double up cheesestake baby you know me, if I ain't on San Diego at Gorgino's this is the place, cheesestake is my kryponite we all know this and I get weak in the gas pedal every time I have to pass up caps on the way home, huh? The wife's workin late tonight I think I'll sneak off and get me my fix! Hell yeah, see yall"}
{"text":"Service was good fast and just like I like it and those who've read me know I like my cheese stakes"}
{"text":"Love this place. It has the exact same vibes as Jimmy John's, but personally, I like Capriotti's sandwiches better. Great for vegetarians. Great staff too."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are THE bomb!  Fresh real roasted turkey meat (mmmmmmm) with coleslaw and provolone is awesome! (Can't remember the name of it) and their Philly cheesesteak is great! Everything is made fresh to order.

Anytime we come through Vegas this is a must eat for us! Try them you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Clearly the magic words here are Capastrami and Bobbie. Go in knowing those two words and I promise you you'll leave one happy sandwich-eating mofo. 

For me the Bobbie beats the Capastrami hands down. (The damn amazingness that is the pastrami from Brix in Sunset Beach has ruined all other pastrami for me.)  

The taste of Thanksgiving all smushed together on the tastiest, softest bread ever though, truly makes the Bobbie something to write home about... or at least will make you want to find your nearest Capriottis location and get there ASAP!"}
{"text":"I know it is almost anti Las Vegan of me but this is the first time I have had capriotti's.  It seems everyone I know has been and LOVEs it.  

So tis the season for turkey so I choose to have the Cran-Slam club with Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Ham, Mayo and Lettuce made on sliced white or wheat bread.  I am not a big cranberry person and everything but that in this sandwich I enjoyed.  Lots of meat and no skimping or overdoing the veggies to make up for light meat.

I'll go back again to try another one. :)"}
{"text":"Love this location. First of all it's convenient.i it's at Las Vegas Blvd & Silverado Ranch. But more importantly the food is consistently good. I have never eaten a bad sandwich from this shop. Everything is always fresh and tasty. The service is awesome. I love the fact that EVERYONE gets greeted when they walk in, no matter how busy they are. This is my neighborhood Capriotti's and I love it!"}
{"text":"As I mentioned.. I'm a fan of Capriotti's! Now they are open 24 hours so you can get your BOBBIE and CAPISTRAMI fix any time of the night! The staff in there is extra cool.. always prompt in making your sandwich and really cool about making sure you get exactly what you want. 

Now that they are open late, I'm there.. maybe too often.. But I do love it. If they had a wheat bun, whole wheat..i;d be stoked.. but sometimes 'good' is good just the way it is... 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"The bobbie is definitely what to get when you go to Capriotti's. The only other sandwich I've had is the capistrami which is pretty good too, but that bobbie can't be beat. I went with the $7 for $15 deal and it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"This was literally the worst cheese steak I have ever had in my life! This location sucks! I asked for mayonnaise and double cheese and received the driest sandwich known to mankind. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place until they train their staff to cook a sandwich."}
{"text":"I have only tried one sandwich here and it's so good I have never wanted or even was curious to try out something else. So my rating is only for this particular sandwich : Chicken Philly with no cheese,grilled onions, mushrooms,sweet & hot red/green peppers and a little mayo...Oh Baby, give it to me.... 
This Capriotti's is uniformly made just like other Capriotti's-service was quick and sufficient. I am sad to see that this Capriotti's doesn't sell Mini \"Nothing Bundtcakes\" here but instead they serve Tasty Kakes products. People from the East Coast seem to go crazy for Tasty Kakes-I bought the Jelly filled cakes and it was OK, nothing special-I'd rather buy a Twinkie. Anyhow, my sandwich-YUM!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly but the sandwhich was just horrible. The meat was soggy and had a texture that was so unappealing.  I am pretty sure I enjoyed the same sandwich in Vegas but boy was it different here. Staff gets 4 stars and food gets a half for a two star review."}
{"text":"Got the chopped Italian,  it's alright. I'll try a sandwich next time. I would give it another go though."}
{"text":"If you love fresh turkey, that's Capriotti's claim to fame. I think their fresh soft bread is underrated too.

It's a chain and it's casual but great alternative to fast food. 

I keep coming back for the \"Capistrami\" and \"Bobbie\". They are deservedly sandwich classics."}
{"text":"Let me first say, I am a die hard Capriotti's fan for life! Now that I live quite far away from the closest Cap's, I find myself craving them more than ever.  Luckily I get to get back to Vegas regularly, so I can stuff my face. Why do I love Cap's? Here's why:

1. The sandwiches are super, duper, amazingly tasty. Everything I have tried is amazing, but I usually go for the classic Bobbie (with extra mayo, of course) or a Cheesesteak with mushrooms (and more mayo.). They are yummy, filling, and mouth watering.

FYI, for anyone who doesn't know what the Bobbie is, it is Thanksgiving in a roll.  Roasted turkey, cornbread dressing, home made cranberry sauce, and some mayo on a flaky roll.  It also goes by \"Heaven on a Bun\" in many circles.

2. You usually get great customer service.  It seems you have to be rad to work at a Cap's. Happy people + Good customer service = Lotsa repeat customers. 

3. Did I mention my love for the Bobbie with extra mayo????

Capriotti's is just a fantastic sandwich shop with great food.  If you haven't tried them yet, go to one ASAP!

As for my 4 star rating, it is because of the physical location.  This parking lot is a hot mess at all times of the day.  This is probably because of the LVAC gym located in the same area, but it is still a pain to get in and out easily.  You are risking your life trying to walk around and risking your car from the crazy drivers.  I rarely go to this location for this very fact."}
{"text":"I like this location. It is close to home, always clean, and the staff are friendly. That is my trifecta right there!

The sandwiches are huge and super tasty. The Bobbie is amazing and everyone needs to eat it at least once in their lifetime. If you don't, it's like a life half lived. The cheesesteak is really good too. My husband's favorite is the Capastrami. 

Do yourself a favor and swing by for an awesome sandwich that will make your tummy happy."}
{"text":"If you go to eat at the store you might want to actually ask somebody where you're supposed to be standing if you want to place an order as many times I've gone to Capriotti's throughout Las Vegas and Henderson you always order at the counter  and then usually pay for it after you order it. Not so much at the store if you standby the counter you will surely be ignored and they will help the people that are standing by the register so advice to anybody who plans on eating here ask where you're supposed to order from because it's not stated where."}
{"text":"After having a not so stellar experience at the Capriottis on Flamingo and Sandhill, I came to the one on Sunset and Marks st. right off the 95.
I ordered the Slaw Be Jo, it was spot on! I asked for a extra side of Russian dressing which they gladly fulfilled.
I mean the Bobbie is great but sometimes you gotta change it up!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from many Capriotti's. Unfortunately, this is this closest location to my house.  Do not order from this location if you love the Capriotti's flavor.  This location doesn't deserve the sign on the front of their building.  Customer service is key, and this is where they have failed."}
{"text":"Seating is limited at this Capriotti's location. Either you take it to go or you eat at a narrow little counter. Whenever I go in it seems I am the only customer who eats there. Most people come in, get their sandwich and go. But I know that is not the case because today the floor was covered in chips, crumbs and a bit of lettuce. Somebody enjoyed their food a little too much. Not that I can talk. I went through fout napkins with my grilled Italian sub today. It was saucy to the max. The meat was good and there was a fair amount of it. The toppings were on skimpy side. Overall though it was a good sandwich. The taste was on point.

The kitchen was being cleaned when I walked in but the dining room was dirty. The staff seemed to all be friends which is fine and helps them pass the day but that made for an almost unprofessional environment. One guy even walked his baby to the back and into the kitchen to say \"hi\" to all the staff. It really bothers me when I see this. The kitchen of a public restaurant is no place for children. Thats a pet peev of mine. That is why this Capriotti's gets 3 stars from me today."}
{"text":"This rating is based only on the service. I called to place an order for a small cheesesteak. The lady told me it would be 20 minutes. I got there right around the 20 minute mark. I walked in and went straight to the counter to pay. I waited and waited. There were four workers all working on food and not one acknowledged me. Not a \"we will be with you soon\" or anything. I stood there for 10 minutes waiting! One of the workers finally came over to ring someone else up. He called the persons name, they came to the counter, paid and walked away. I fully expected him to then turn to me and ask if he could help me. He didn't! He started to walk back to the food prep line! I was shocked. I finally asked for his help. I told him I called in an order and wondered if it was ready. He checked the shelf and sure enough, it was there and had been the entire time. I was so irritated! I get one hour for lunch and I spent 30 of it waiting for food to be prepared and rang up. I wasted half my lunch break. When he rang me up, it came to more than I expected. I questioned him and he said he accidentally rang me up for a medium. Really? Was that an accident or do they conveniently ring people up for the wrong amounts often? Sounds strange to me. The sandwich was good but the service was terrible. At my place of business, we acknowledge everyone as soon as they walk in the door and always apologize when we make them wait for even a minute or two. I am disappointed in the location to say the least. Probably enough to make me not go back."}
{"text":"Crappy customer service! They were out of stuffing but didn't say anything. After 10 mins waiting I asked what we were waiting for and they said the stuffing would be just 5 more mins. Waited a total of 25 mins and they had forgotten my order. Other people got their bobbies that they ordered after me before I did. I asked for the manager and he had been standing there the whole time and didn't even offer an apology until I said something to him. I don't care how far I have to go out of my way I won't be going back to this location. This is a privately owned franchise location and I hope the manager cares enough to train his employees better and not lose money out of his pocket."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's only me, but I felt like cleanness wasn't there specially on a brand new place, bathrooms  really stinky and dirty all the floors  full on crumbs and tables not clean enough, service and food  are ok."}
{"text":"Spent 28 took one bite and brushed my teeth. I could not take the pastrami at all. Horrid... My friend ate his cud I paid but he complained... Yet he still ate it..."}
{"text":"24hrs! - If your craving A Thanksgiving Dinner Come Here the Turkey and Stuffing is amazing!"}
{"text":"Came back here again during my recent trip to Vegas and this time, I bought a 20 inch cheese steak to bring back home with me to the bay. It was freakin' huge and full of meaty goodness. I'm only 5 feet tall (60 inches) so the 20 inch sandwich is like a third of my height!!!!

The sandwich was the only reason I checked my bag in and paid $15 for it. So worth it."}
{"text":"I sat patiently for my food that I ordered online that stated would take 15 minutes, so i showed up at 15 minute marker. Sandwich hadn't even been started but I was still pleasant no worries. 10 mins later got my food took the apologies for the delay but said it was ok and left...all in all a good customer for the delay....get back to my office the specific NO CHEESE not and verbal comment it was the cheesesteak without the CHEESE was ignored...melted cheese...no way to eat around it...after being so nice about the delay you couldn't make sure my sandwich was correct? Got my money back will not be going back. RESTUARANTS PLEASE STOP MESSING UP ORDERS IT REALLY ISNT A HARD TASK TO COMPLETE YET HAPPENS SOOOO MANY TIMES"}
{"text":"Good flavors, but can be a little dry sometimes. Overall a good experience & will definitely be back! Maybe next time I will order with a little extra mayo :)"}
{"text":"I love capriottis but this location really messed up my sandwich i ordered a crab slam club in a roll I don't mind paying for the extra charge it was so dry I specifically asked for extra mayo mustard and pickels but it had no mayo or mustard i also felt that the amount of filling that my sandwich had was not the same as usual when I was carrying it i felt like I was holding a wet noodle the turkey was also dry and not moist like the other locations I've been to in the valley overall i don't think I'll come back to this one"}
{"text":"Its a sub shop located right above the Double Helix. AWESOME customer service!! Very friendly and oh so helpful! And you HAVE to try the Capastrami if you are a pastrami fan like myself :) As far as sub shops go, this is one of the \"As good as it gets\" businesses."}
{"text":"I've eaten at several of their locations, no issues. They all have great staff. My problem is, this is the second time I've eaten at this location & become deathly ill. 
I will not eat here EVER again. Never an issue of the meat, but the vegetables on the sandwich, I don't believe we're fresh or sanitary."}
{"text":"This Sandwich Shop is My All Time Favorite in Las Vegas! 

-Every Location is Small, but they have Outdoor Seating
-Every Location that I have Visited has Always Been Clean & Well Stocked in the Potato Chip/Soda area.
-They Always Greet You With a Smile!
-There is One Location in Southern Highlands...Near Perks Cafe!
-I Get My Sandwich very Quickly, and If Not, they Apologize for the Delay!
-My Faves are the BOBBIE & CAPASTRAMI (Although I hear the Philly Cheesesteak is Amazing)
-FREE REFILLS (If you Eat In)
 
They do Catering & You Can also Order Ahead!"}
{"text":"It is a tad bit more pricey then other sandwich places but, it is really delicious.  They have great bread and the fillings are delicious.

The italian sandwich is delicious and I love the soy chicken cheesesteak.

This place has one of the best italian sandwiches I have ever tasted."}
{"text":"I ordered a sandwich via the app for pickup a half hour ago and it is still not ready even though they said it was. I'm in the store now, it's not busy at all. I love Cap's so I'm hoping not to have another experience like this."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent quick service.  However, this place should extend their excellence in the eating area.  Tables are not clean, floor needs to be swept.  Not that busy, someone could have come out front and taken care of it.  But again, the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Ordered at 8:25pm and told the employees we were going to sit down.  They packaged my food up anyways and told me they didn't have any forks for me to eat my salad with.... I asked them to not package it up and they said they close at 9 and it would be hard to eat my salad there without a fork!  They offered to wash a fork for me?!?! Lol, last time I tried to eat there they were out of bread, now they were out of forks... great customer service guys!  Food was good though, but we got kicked out half hour before closing time!"}
{"text":"Nope wouldnt recommend it. Not good quality. Not worth it. I have heard good things but I was very disappointed when I finally went. Definitely not my first pick nor my favorite. I was thinking it was going to be amazing. Guess I got my hopes up too much. Oh well."}
{"text":"Love this place. The best and freshest sandwiches in Vegas.  If you like Real Turkey(like Thanksgiving), fresh breads and killer peppers...hit them up when in town.  You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches for a fair price.
Found the quality to be fresh and tasteful.
You can get a 20\" large and eat it with two friends!
I recommend the grilled Italian. My brother likes the cheesesteak. We're from Philadelphia so youze gotta know it's pretty decent."}
{"text":"Get the Bobbie... every inch is like Thanksgiving again! One of the best sandwiches I've eaten ever in life. Only reason it takes a hit is because ordering over the phone is nearly impossible. I hate having to wait a while when I'm hungry already."}
{"text":"Quick , hot and yummy philly! The staff is extremely friendly place is clean all of them seem to be happy to be here"}
{"text":"Uh. They took twenty five minutes to make my sandwich without an explanation. We were the only ones in the place. Nancy Grace was blaring. The walls and floors are yellow. Somebody was coughing in the back. 

I love snobby stoner jocks with after school jobs, but not when they act like snobby stoner jocks with after school jobs while I\"m waiting. Forever. With Nancy Grace yelling. 

Pass. 

(Actually though, the veggie cheeseburger was amazing and, with one other sandwich, fifteen dollars. I was looking to see if they put unicorn hooves or diamonds into it. None sighted.)"}
{"text":"I first had a taste of The Bobbie about three years ago at work for a party. As I was doing some holiday shopping, this sandwich was calling my name. 

I stopped in and ordered mine to go. It was nicely wrapped, and was a nice presentation. This sandwich was as good, if not better, than I remembered. It's not too sweet, which is perfect. I love love love cranberry sauce, and this combination is excellent. The bread they have is very flavorful all by itself. 

I saved a small bit for my husband to try. He was surprised at how much he liked this sandwich. He was ready to get another for himself."}
{"text":"This location is super friendly.  They always have my sandwich ready when I place an order on the Eat24 app.  The sandwiches are always stuffed and tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered r sandwiches and within less than 5mins we got r sandwiches. Great staff inside this location, very friendly and fast. The medium is huge, wow. I have not eaten at this place in for ever. So excited I found one close to my house."}
{"text":"I never consider a Vegas trip complete without a trip to Cap's. This location is the first one I ever went to with a buddy of mine that grew up in Vegas. I usually hit the one on Sunset and the 93 on my way out of town, cause it conveniently located off the highway as I am leaving, but I was excited to see that There is now one near the Strip in the Town Square south of Mandalay Bay, and one on Eastern and the 215 by the Chuck-e-Cheese. No matter what you get when you go to Cap's, you will not be disappointed, but for me, nothing beats the Bobbie."}
{"text":"Well, just add me to the list of fans of a wonderful \"unique\" sandwich shop. When I went to the Sahara location (on a Monday when it opened), I had no problem with parking and there were very few customers inside. The staff was extremely helpful and the shop was very clean. I new I was In a good place when one of the customers odered 18 sandwiches!!!...lol..."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are addicting. I had the grilled Italian this time. I plan to try them all."}
{"text":"Love Cap's!!  The Bobbie is a must have.  This location is newer and always very clean.  The staff is always friendly and I have never had a problem with my order.  The only reason no 5 stars is the parking is limited.  I never go during peak hours.  Bonus...they deliver!!!"}
{"text":"What can be said about Caps' Bobby? Everything, it's my favorite all time sandwich! It's the best. This location has very friendly people and it's always clean and nice. We always stop by here on our way out of town and they have no problem with making my wife her special sandwich."}
{"text":"Have been to several Caps around the valley many times, always a consistent brand. This was my second visit to this location, both times have been sub par. Last night was the same. Actually watched the guy making my Bobby picking and eating meat while making my sandwich. Blah. The overall appearance of the place was nasty and dirty. Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches and staff...quick friendly service :)  My favorites are the bobbie, cheese steak and italian.  Awesome!  :)"}
{"text":"Me and a couple coworker ordered some lunch online. After we paid and placed our orders, we waited for our pick up time which was 6. It took them an additional hour to redo our subs since they said that it didnt print out and then they messed up after getting the order. They didnt bother telling us about the problem. After waiting for 20 more minutes, they had our order ready and tried to make us pay even though our payment went through online. The girl didnt seem like she knew what she was doing and then said that she was sorry. After the hole ordeal, we finally got to eat. But our sandwiches were messed up there was no lettuce and tomato even though we ordered it our sandwiches were completely drowning in mayo. I MEAN DROWNING. They completely messed up our sandwiches. First time im actually very disappointed in their staff."}
{"text":"Called in an order, after 30m of siting in the waiting area I hear 'hey you need something?' Only to find out they've never even started on my sandwiches. Will not be visiting again, just don't have 45m to wait for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Still a step above most sandwich shops for using real, identifiable meat. I've taken my rating down a star, though, for what's seemed like a fall-off in quality and convenience. The last two sandwiches I had (spread out over a few months) came with a dose of bone and/or gristle, and before my last trip there were a few different times I tried to order to find they weren't delivering past peak dinner time or were closed completely before it was even 8 o'clock on a Saturday night.

I do realize that the shop is probably just responding to demand, but demand might be a little higher if they were putting the same effort into their product as when the shop opened a few years ago."}
{"text":"The first time we ate there this place was new. I ordered a Philly Cheese Steak sandwich and it was disappointing in taste and sparse on the meat. A disappointment. Tonight we went back and they seem to have a better grasp on things. Ordered the meat ball and Mozzarella sub and it was first rate. I'll order that from now on. Good people made me raise my 3 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"I like Capriotti's except this one on the 11000 block of S Eastern Ave.  I go out of my way to go to there other location because there sandwiches especially the steak and chicken cheese have half the amount of meat than all the other location. I'm tray disappointed as I live across the street from this location. It's definitely worth driving a couple miles for a much better sandwich. I have tried this store 3 times and every time was the same."}
{"text":"The service at this location was horrible! The staff was playing around behind the counter for 15-20 minutes while all of the customers were waiting for their orders. All of the tables were dirty and the staff that was eating left his table dirty too."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but mediocre at best.  Jimmy johns it is.  Jersey mikes might be better too.  Turkey is carved and fresh but slightly dry so the heaping amount of cole slaw takes away from tbe dry taste.  My opinion, too much cole slaw, not enough turkey.  Nice friendly staff and quick service though, and tv in the place to watch the football games on Sunday.  Don't know how people can give 5 stars for paying 9.50 for a sandwich and drink.  Oh, bread is average at best, 
Maybe too chewy.  I had bread last night at maggianis,  that's good bread there. Dry turkey with smallish portions and too much cole slaw make it barely a 3 star.  It's a different concept of pulled turkey and I give them props for that.  Service is quick and friendly , props for that.  Just don't skimp on the best thing, the turkey. Oh, and as I was leaving, 2 people complained.  One wanted more provolone as they skimped on it, and another asked why no wheat options."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here. Sandwiches are always on point, shop is clean, and people are friendly  and quick. My go to neighborhood sandwich shop. Blows subway out of the water."}
{"text":"Never has the ingredients for a Slaw B Joe sandwich. I have attempted calling and going in and every time they never have roast beef. I didn't know it was so hard to order meat and to keep your store stocked up."}
{"text":"Their staff is friendly and respectful! Awesome location and even better sandwiches. Cheese steak sub with mushrooms and sweet/hot peppers is what I come here for!"}
{"text":"They were smart and opened early for labor day weekend. 8am-3pm"}
{"text":"Ordered a Cheese steak  several days ago over the phone.  They were pretty quick and had the order ready when my husband arrived.  The sub was decent overall.  I did ask for sweet peppers and onions and I could barely see or taste them in my sub.  I can understand being skimpy on the meat but not the veggies.  I would still order a cheese steak next time I have a craving for one."}
{"text":"Colton and Adam helped us out this morning with amazing takeout for our pharmacy at Walgreens"}
{"text":"I love the \"Bobbi\" from here, it's a Thanksgiving dinner in one bite. The people working were super busy yet very polite a speedy. Only reason they received a 4 Star was the had run out of chicken noodle soup, a staple during sick/ flu season. Regardless friends family and helpers come eat!"}
{"text":"I often order the chicken noodle soup from here through GrubHub and I always put in the \"extras\" section that I want a bunch of their white bread (which is really good!). Tonight I had a mixup where I didn't initially get any and after I called them to solve it I was sent a whole loaf of bread!! Congrats, you've made my night and secured another loyal customer :)"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME... if you want a great sandwich go here.... and go with the name sake... I'm glad they have a place here in Utah, wish they had more locations."}
{"text":"I like Capriotti's regardless of the fact that its a franchise. I love the Bobbie (as all the other fellow yelpers do) for the cranberry stuffing turkey goodness and the Capastrami with all its pastrami coleslaw yummyness. I definitely come here when I feel like a good hearty sandwich. I am always full after eating here, which for 7 bucks for a 9 incher, that's a pretty good deal I think!"}
{"text":"Um ever had a sandwich before? If it wasnt here it probably wasnt that good... unless you spent way too much money on it. I can only think of one other place i like more than capriottis. So stop wasting your money and go here... if you are in VEGAS!!

They are juicy and yummy and tastebud orgasmic (look it up... i am no way responsible for what you find). I loved the meatball... the turkey and cranberry, and the pastrami. Holy cow... so delicious. Why a sandwich place while you are in vegas... follow me to the next paragraph and I will tell you.

Because sometimes you just need something quick. sometimes you just need a tasty greasy bite and this place offers you that guilty feeling of indulgence but... wont kill you. They just know what theyre doing and they are doing it well. The bread seems fresh bakes, the meat is tender and dare I say flavorful (that is to say well spiced, mixed well with sauces and oils, and works well with toppings, coleslaw, lettuce, etc, damn people stop saying flavorful!!!)

THE VERDICT: you feel like a sandwich. stop by capriottis, you wont regret it. you will only regret not being more italian. but hey... i cant think of any possible way for you to change your race, so... just eat the sandwich and feel that way. I'd eat it while watching the sopranos. amen and amen."}
{"text":"I noticed that when this location gets within 30 minutes of closing time their favorite thing to do is tell people they are entirely out of every single size of bread. 
I noticed it three times because I do forget they close earlier than most locations! They are a corporate location and I will be calling their location tomorrow and getting that number because the two young kids working there were entirely rude when I went in."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is always fantastic. This one is brand new and right on my way home from work. I can order online and they are awesome as always."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop in Vegas. The best is the Capastrami, which has a hefty helping of hot piping pastrami along with cole slaw and Russian dressing. Even the small size is really big so I usually share the sandwich with another person. The Bobbie is pretty good too. It has pulled Turkey meat with a couple of scoops of stuffing and some cranberry sauce on top. Thanksgiving comfort food."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich places in town!!! I haven't had one I didn't like! I try to pick a different sandwich every time so i can eventually try everything! The customer service isn't that great so that's why I only gave 4 stars! This past visit I tried the broccoli cheddar soup and the balsamic salad and was very impressed. I will definitely be back again but hope to return some smiling faces!!!"}
{"text":"I came here as my first meal at Vegas during my vacation. I wanted to try something new besides Johnny Rockets and Subway (which are available back in San Jose). 

The vicinity was small and a bit awkward since I stood at the register, but the cook asked for my order behind the counter. I tried the  Bobbie and the boy tried the Capastrami. We both got the small size which came up to about $15. Kinda pricey but what the hey! It's Vegas right? Ahahahaha

We were first going to eat at the shop, but decided to take our sammiches back to our room at the hotel across the street so we could have some sweet tea and chips as well as tv. 

Both sammiches were delicious AND filling so I was glad I got a small. I wish Capriotti's was available here in SJ so that I could try their other yummy creations."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me!   First I waited to be serviced ... the worker saw me at the registers but did nothing to ask or say anything to me. Then another persons walks up to the long counter beside me and the worker runs to them to take their order. I'm thinking what the heck!  I then noticed a small font sign that stated \"order here\" but it was turned sideways so from the front you couldn't see it. I calmly walked and got behind the person who was NOW ordering and turned the sign so it could be read. I placed my order and was told it would be a couple of minutes... 40 mins.... count them 40 mins later I get my sandwiches. I should have left, but was on a lunch run for my wife. 

My advice is to skip this place at all cost (which will be your valuable time) absolutely the worse. 
I just opened the sandwiches and there were nothing other than meat and cheese on both sandwiches even though the menu list several additions. This Sucks! Now a customer has to open their to-go sandwich to be sure they put in all the ingredients ?  Can I change this review to 1/2 star?"}
{"text":"Yummy Bobbie sub, its Thanksgiving on a roll. Turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce with a bit of mayonnaise.   Ask for extra cranberry sauce though!"}
{"text":"Ranking this sandwhich place is tough, simply because I think I ordered the wrong thing and can't give it an honest review.  For whatever reason, I ordered the \"Slaw Turkey\" which is a turkey sandwhich stacked high with cole slaw.  It sounded good when I ordered it, but then I realized that I don't really like coleslaw that much.  It is good for a few bites as a side dish with your burger, but a little too much when included in every bite of your turkey sandwhich.
Bottom line.....I think this place has great potential.  I just need to be a little more conservative with my next sandwhich selection next go around."}
{"text":"Ordered a Bobbie! The girl with all the tattoos behind the counter greeting me upon entering, was extremely friendly and fast.. I couldn't have been waiting more than five minutes. Will be returning"}
{"text":"We found cockroaches cooked in the Great Buns and had a cockroach run across the floor at Flamingo and Decature. I absolutely quit on them at that point. The managers don't do anything but yell at their employees. Being 100% honest with you guys trust me when I say Capriotti's has serious health problems. You're eating rat shit and cockroaches. They're \"DM\" Fred is too young with too much on his hands. He tried to  act like I was lying after the half cut Great Bun had a roach in it and we just wanted our money back. Seems like a bunch of kids running the store. My brother in law is the VP for Boyd Gaming and he won't recommend Cap's to anyone nor even give them a try. God forbid you go to Flamingo and Decatur. That store has roaches running on the walls."}
{"text":"Picked up a large 20\" Chicken cheesesteak today. The girl that made it dumped so much pepper on it, nobody could even eat it. We ended up throwing it away. They are lucky we did not have the time to go back and get our money back. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"After walking around in the Premium Outlet in the morning, my family and I decided to eat something for lunch.  Sick and tired of all the buffets, we decided to eat something different.  Since we are staying in Springhill Suite close to convention center, we found this place which has a very high rating.  My wife ordered the capastrami, and I order the Be Jo and Bobbie.  Be Jo I think is okay.  the roast beef was a bit dry when you eat it.  

My wife love the capastrami.  she think the combination of the pasrami along with cole slaw and dressing is just great.  She is not a great fan of turkey stuffing and cranberry, so she is not too found of the Bobbie.  On the other hand, I do enjoy that sweet taste in Bobbie.  I have to say this is a true original concept.  haven't had similar sandwich in other places.  The strange part (not sure if is on purpose) the filling is cold ..... that just simply add more flavor to the sandwich for me.  
  
this is definitely a place I would try next time again when I need to get away from buffet.  and I DO NEED to get away from Buffet."}
{"text":"Got the cheese steak and asked for the sauteed mushrooms, onions, peppers on the side so they gave me raw Instead with a cold cheese steak and barely any meat.  
I dont normally have a bad experience but it when its simple it shouldn't be that bad... Just saying. 
Might want to step up the management."}
{"text":"I have always loved Capriotti's, but this store is horrible! Had to go back not once, but twice and the order STILL wasn't right! They were pushing desserts, which we paid for, and they were not in the bag. Two of the three sandwiches were made wrong and they even omitted items that cost extra, that were paid for. I have watched this place go downhill for awhile now, but today was the last straw."}
{"text":"Placed an order to-go. They forgot one of our sandwiches, the other sandwich we ordered ended up being so salty that nobody would eat it, and they didn't have one of our soups we ordered so they replaced it with a salad. The whole order was completely jacked up. Don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"I gotta say the Bobbie has to be one of my favorite sandwiches ever.  I absolutely love all the componets that make the sandwich.  Especially the cranberry I appreciate the fact it's not the jello like stuff you get in a can.  For me it's what makes the sandwich.  The capstrami is another good sandwich."}
{"text":"Capriottis sandwiches are great.  The staff at this location - on the day I was there - awful. Instead of enjoying my food I'm typing this review that's how annoyed I am.

Walked in and the open wasn't lit so I let them know. The two of them laughed and then did nothing... it's still off.

We ordered our food and the guy at the register had zero personality and was not friendly at all.

In spite of saying the food was for here they give me the sandwiches as to go with no tray to eat on.  When I go back to ask for a tray you would think I just told them to break the law.

Then we open the sandwiches and they got the majority of our order wrong. Their remedy when confronted - just hand me the missing tomatoes to put on myself.  Am i capable of that - yes.  Did I pay them to then make my own sandwich - absolutely not.

I go back to my original statement - food is great - service at this location sucks.  The owner needs to restaff quick."}
{"text":"I don't think i can go to Vegas again and be satisfied without stopping by this great sandwhich shop (and Sonics) . I'd never used to go somewhere just for their pastrami- i was never a huge fan of the Hat, Top etc, even though it's good. but now good is not enough, since i know out there, there's a whole better sandwhich. The thanksgiving dinner in a bun (their turkey sandwhich) is awesome as well. 

too bad there aren't any in California. - drives me crazy! Just like how there's only ONE Sonic's within an hour and a half drive and they bombard us with those commercials."}
{"text":"Cuz a foot isn't long enough!!!
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1bALsE6aZE23mGV2WPxN_g?select=anOeubumuKq8jHiIMbHi3w

I had my first taste of the Capistrami in Vegas and was so excited they opened a location in Beverly Hills, but after coming to this new location, i am reminded that i still like the set up in Vegas the best. 
It feels alot more family run and friendly here.
Place your order first with the cooks, grab your drinks out the fridge and chips to munch on, and pay at the register. Be generous and give them tip for their Beer Fund! 

I've enjoyed the Bobbie and the Slaw Be Jo, (the philly is too spicy for me), but i still love their Capistrami the best. This time we got a 20 inch of that, and 12 inch roast beef Slaw Be Jo. They have tastykakes here, which i have yet to try and i love their potato chip selection. 

If ur tired of buffet gorging or don't have enough money left to keep splurging, and had enough of Sonics, I def recommend trying their pastrami! 

* about 7 min from the strip a little past the Palms"}
{"text":"We walked in and the place smelled horrible! The employees were less than friendly and seemed like we were bothering them by being here. Haven't tasted the food yet, hoping it's better than the customer service.
Well it didnt get any better. Grabbed our food just to get out of there and when we got home, I realized my order was WRONG!!! Ordered 1/2 sub with no mixed greens and soup. I got a SALAD and soup! Now i don't even want the damn soup cuz I'm so pissed that i just spent almost $20 for a sandwich and a combo and they screwed it up. And it's not like they were busy. We were the only customers in there. If i could give them zero stars, i would. Will NEVER GO BACK HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the nicest interior of a Capriotti's I have seen, but like many others have said on here, the quality of the food here is not the same as others. I'm not going to name names, b/c I don't like doing that, but the staff here (at least the night I went) is very immature, with no credible manager or employee in sight. They all seemed to be stoned. Bread wasn't very soft, which is what I come to Capriotti's for. On top of that, I got a stomach virus from having one of their salads. I have learned my lesson from this place. Never order produce (lettuce) that is being handled by a bunch of teenagers or people in their 20's still with the mindset of a teenager. Was very disappointed by this place. Don't let the inside deceive you. Will not be returning to this location, ever, after getting sick."}
{"text":"This is the best sub shop's (in Las Vegas, from back east) now-chain, but this is where it all started. When I first heard about this Bobbie sandwich- turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo on a sub roll- I couldn't really imagine it tasting good, but my co-worker assured me that it was delicious. Ok, I took a chance and it was so good! I was hooked. It's like Thanksgiving in a sandwich. (This is funny because they say that imitation is the best form of flattery. We now make sandwiches like the Bobbie, with our Thanksgiving leftovers.)

Through the years, I've tried the cheese steak (yum), the grilled italian (hot sub- one of my husband's favorites), the cran slam club (least favorite) and the capastrami (pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing, & cole slaw- trust me- ok, a warning here, it's messy)- now my absolute favorite sub sandwich here. 

The counter is super high (for me anyway) so you can't really see, but once, when my sandwich was being prepared, I noticed that the turkey was weighed on a scale. The bread is really good, the meat is really good too, and the rest of the ingredients are high-quality. The sandwiches are broken down to the following categories: cap's specials, sandwiches, vegetarian, cold subs, & hot subs. Some of the chips selections are from back east (wise). 

Also, the sizes are: Small- 9\", Medium- 12\", & Large- 20\". Prices range from $6.50 - $12.50 for most of the subs (Do not even compare this place to Subway's $5 footlong- it's in a totally different class of its own). I usually eat half, save half. Tip: If you get the large one, you can have three meals. The nice change (recently) about this restaurant are the weekend hours: Sat- 10-8, Sun-11-7. Also, there are so many locations due to the popularity that chances are there's one in your neighborhood, if you're local. If you're not, this is one of the places you need to try, when you're in town."}
{"text":"Came here after a long night of drinking. The philly cheesesteak helped me nurse my hangover."}
{"text":"We were back in Vegas last week and Capriotti's on Sahara was a must stop for us.  I had the Italian sausage with peppers and onions and it was outstanding.  My wife went for the Capistrami again and she was \"in heaven\".  If you want a great sandwich prepared just right, you can't beat Capriotti's."}
{"text":"So glad that they have relocated away from the lvac! It's just down the street on Serene.. Parking isn't as crazy but the sandwhiches area just as amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped there last Saturday night and ordered two sandwiches for carry out.  Called 20 minutes in advance, and they said it would be ready upon arrival.  There were only 6 customers in the restaurant, and when I arrived they hadn't even begun my order.  They only had 2 employees working on a Saturday night.....one cook and one cashier.....both overwhelmed. Just embarrassingly pathetic service.  My order finally finished in another 25 minutes, and then they left one item out of the carry out bag.  The cashier looked shell shocked....no apologies....and just gave me a blank stare.  As previously mentioned, their kitchen looked like it wouldn't have passed a health department check. If having just 2 employees working on the busiest night of the week is any indication, it tells you how highly the owner/manager regards his customers.  As for the level of the cuisine, just barely above Subway quality....but don't look at the kitchen, or you won't want to eat it.

(Also concur with the lack of parking comments.....almost non-existent)"}
{"text":"Always consistent and fast. easy to park and to have a quick sandwich. Love the capistrami!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I am NOT a fan of Delis AT ALL none.. I hate strange meat,meat thats been laying out under someone breathing all over it.. chopped meat that someone else has touched..blah, blah blah..Im a freak, I know. However, I was lured into this shop with a friend who swears that this place is the END ALL. I of course will have a bite of his because I am a snob who doesn't eat stuff like that. lol! He had to restrain me from demolishing his Capastrami Sandwich. That had to be THE BEST sandwich that ever crossed my lips. Tender meat, perfect coleslaw, perfect melted cheese and the bread? Fugetaboutit! Seriously.That sandwich made my heart happy! :o)  My only complaint is it wasn't hand fed to me by a rippling man in a loin cloth with my drink...lol!"}
{"text":"Service at this location is not as good as some other one's. I walked in and waited at the counter for maybe 5 mins. I was staring at the girl behind the counter either she didn't see me and was too busy with her current order or didn't care. At least acknowledge the fact that I'm there waiting for someone to take me order! A quick 'hi I'll be right with you' would have been nice! Also I order a mushroom cheese stake with onions and lettuce. It was a to-go order so once I opened it I found no lettuce....fail. It was my first time at this location but I was not impressed with this store."}
{"text":"The staff took awhile to make my mushroom cheese steak so they gave me a brownie to make up for it."}
{"text":"Everytime I make a trip out to Vegas from Los Angeles, I must stop by Capriotti's to get a Capastrami! One of the best pastrami sandwiches I've had, a mix of pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw and russian dressing. I also like the Bobbie, which is somewhat like thanksgiving in a sandwich! Turkey, stuffing, mayo and cranberry sauce makes this sandwich unique. 
These sandwiches are so good, on more than one occasion I've shown up in the middle of the afternoon, and they were out of bread! I really wish they'd open one up in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, their shop at the red rock casino. I decided to take advantage of their anniversary special on the..Bobbie for $4.... this was a full sandwich..I also purchased a pastrami, full size...Guess What...no signs posted for the special on the Bobbie...I had to ask them to get this..Bobbie... at the special price....Guess What....a few scraps of turkey, compared to the huge amount on the pastrami?????

IF YOU ARE GOING TO DO THIS...WHY NOT SELL ALL YOUR SANDWICHES FOR $4... WITH SCRAPS OF MEAT...DUH..

SHAME ON YOU"}
{"text":"Not the best sandwich I have had, but better than fast food subs. The Bobby was a unique take, but the rest of the menu was kind of so so.  I had the chicken cheese.  The chicken was good, shredded white meat that tasted fresh and the only reason I'm rating three stars. Be advised, if you like hot pepper, the pepper option is pepper relish that wasn't spicy at all.  

This is a take out place! (no public restroom and not much of a seating area)."}
{"text":"No bueno. I ordered The Bobbie  and it was not good. They were very tight/ selfish with the dressing and the Turkey left much to be desired-dry , bland. It's not a crime for the Turkey to actually taste like something. This Turkey taste like nothing. Where did it come from? A bag?. Fast service but i will not be Back."}
{"text":"It took like 20 mins for my sandwich, I asked if they had cappacola and they had no clue what that was... kinda strange but whatever. I didnt understand why it took soo long for my food, I order 1 small sub and I was the only person there... plus there were 3 workers! wtf?! 

I was like sooo super excited because I heard great things about this place! So I get to work and unwrap this mystical creature and bam! Its like my hard on went away! I asked politely for no tomatoes or onions... what do you think I see?! So I was like ugh. I sat there and poked out all the yuckiness and took a bite and almost choked because of the insane amount of pepper! 

I will not return, Ive had wayyy yummier sandwiches from 7-11."}
{"text":"What a great sandwich shop.  Italian sausage and a couple pastrami sandwiches were outstanding.  The young lady who took our orders was the kind that every employer would want working for them.  Sandwiches were prepared quickly and we're filled.  Great place to eat."}
{"text":"I always enjoy hitting this spot for lunch.  The Cram Slam club is the way to go.   Portions are perfect and the price is perfect.  Get a cookie too!"}
{"text":"My husband called in the order and he asked if we can trade the cheese for mushrooms for no charge since I can't eat cheese due to severe allergies.  The person on the phone said it wouldn't be a problem.  When I got there, I was told they didn't have the chicken to make the chicken philli.  They didn't even have the stuff to make the veggie, which was my second choice.  I ended up settling for the philli steak, which was stuffed, but a little dry.  To make matters worse, the person I'm assuming is the manager (the young skinny guy with the beard bikerish looking...not very scary looking to me) gave me an attitude when I told him my about the mushrooms.  He said \"we don't do that.\"  Then demanded to know who took the order (I don't know who you are, but you are safe).  I was beside myself as to how rude and abrupt this guy was.  I mean, really, if someone is allergic to something DON'T CHARGE THEM FOR IT!!!!!  From this day forth, we will not patronize this location.  About my hubby's and daughter's phili cheese steak, both said it was flimsy and dry.  Not even bbq sauce would help."}
{"text":"This place served me one of the best sandwiches I have had in my entire life, and that is not an exaggeration. Everything about it was great. The ingredients were top notch and the taste was sooooo good! My mom and I ordered the Capastrami sandwich, which was delicious, but my dad had the Italian and my brother had the Cheese Steak and they loved those as well.

I highly recommend coming here if you are in Vegas! This particular location is a short drive down the strip, and there is a free parking lot. I can't wait to visit one of their Los Angeles locations (that's where I live)."}
{"text":"I went here after a short trip to Las Vegas...the restaurant is located in the Red Rock Hotel and Casino in Summerlin. I didn't know that this was a large sandwich chain like Subway or Jersey Mike's. I ordered a foot long meatball sub and I have to admit that it was really good. The sauce was excellent and had spices that I really couldn't identify. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"2 weeks in row I stopped in for a Cole Turkey and requested it to be made without mayo. Wouldn't you know both had mayo. Neither time was the place busy but had different young kids making sandwiches. Evidently neither took the time to read the order. Last time I go to this location. Poor Training."}
{"text":"I can't even begin to describe how amazing the staff at Capriotti's off Raintree/101 exit in Scottsdale is! They have gone above and beyond in their service and I can't express how much I appreciate them. I am 8 months pregnant and order Capriotti's at least once a week (I know, I know) - and the reason I keep them as my #1 place to go for my work lunches is that they are without a doubt the best company around. During one order, my chips were forgotten - not a big deal, I called and let them know just as a head's up. The next time I placed an order, they provided chips and a drink - my usual order choices too! I can't speak for all Capriotti's out there, but the staff at the Scottsdale location off Raintree/101 is AMAZING! You all have made this difficult (first) pregnancy easier! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The service here was awesome!  I liked the turkey club.  I would definitely come back.  The skinny, short white guy is especially awesome and nice.  The people that work here are exceptional and great."}

{"text":"Wow. How far they have fallen. I used to buy like 4-6 large every Monday for the office. Yesterday I had a medium turkey. That was all bread. Like where was the fn turkey ugggggg. I'm done"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical of this little sandwich shop but a local friend of mine raved about it. As far as a sandwich shop goes I'd say it's good. The one thing I really enjoyed was the cole slaw on a number of the special sandwiches. It added a lot of moistness and crunch to an otherwise standard sandwich. 

Pretty good for a quick bite. I recommend the Capistrami. Very tasty!"}
{"text":"Sandwichqes by it self delicious of course... but the service is disappointing. ... every single time when I order, I doesn't get what I want... they always screwed up my order... for example I ordered 14 days ago 12\" Bobbie sandwich, and I wanted worm. Well they gave me cold one... so I asked to make me new one and they made me crrect order this time but instead of 12\" they gave me 9\", what rood.. and when i said i paid for 12\" ,that guy said \"hey bro i made you extra sandwich\"...

Who cares???? You screwed up  dude, not me...
.. you pay for something what you doesn't even get.

Today I ordered Italian sub (fully loaded) that means of course everything's on it... And they asked me back if I want mayo,mustard,pickels,tomato,,lettuce, peppers, cucamber,
Well... they gave me wrong sandwich again... everything on it instead mayo,mustard,and peppers. ... what a retards. ....

I am really disappointed with this location.... 
Looks like these guys doesn't even care they work here...
I love these sandwiches,  but service is horrible...."}
{"text":"Amazing! Exactly the type of subs you want  after drinking, before, for lunch, for dinner, pretty much anytime. Had it delivered to the hotel via Postmates! Blows away spending $40 on a wicked expensive burger in the hotel that you know is overpriced and tastes like $1 burger."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new sub shop... So I had heard good things about this spot I entered the shop at about 7:15 and they say they are open till 8:00 all the chairs were up and it looked closed... But I pulled the door open and entered and stood at the counter and someone come from the back. I knew what I wanted I ordered... (The Bobbie - Homemade turkey, Cranberry sauce, stuffing and Mayo. I rate the food as followed.

The Bobbie - B+

It was a really good sub the bread was super fresh but the turkey was a bit dry like it would be after thanksgiving... Each bit reminded me of things I have made with leftovers from thanksgiving. I will be back again to get another Bobbie when I miss home at 2am after the bars when I am home for thanksgiving and have only leftovers to work with."}
{"text":"Looove the vegetarian turkey sandwich!

I would give it four stars if we were on the East Coast, but there isn't much like it on the West Coast, so it gets an extra star."}

{"text":"Love Capriotti's! We've had sanwiches in Laughlin, Los Angeles, and now here. Three stars because my husband was happy with his sandwich and the employees were delightful...  This location is inside the courthouse so be prepared for the metal detectors. With that being said I was impressed with their quickness and efficiency. Unfortunately I am very disappointed in my order today. We ordered a large Capristrami which my husband loved but my Bobbie was horrible! The whole sandwich (large) was filled with bones, some small that I can understand a slight overlook but others were so big there was no excuse to miss them! We planned to snack on these today and tomorrow and now I have to throw mine away for fear of someone choking on the bones! Very sad"}
{"text":"We went about 15-20 mins before closing, we apologized for being there late to order. We were told in a very rude manner \"Anything you order now is going to be to go\" . I am aware how frustrating it can be to be so close to closing time and have people come in, and our intentions were to order to go but the attitude that is was said, was what made us leave."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely polite and professional. We were greeted by Savino and being our first time here, explained the difference between Capriotti's and other sandwich shops.  
We ordered the cheese steak sandwiches and while we were not impressed by the sandwich, it was still pretty good. Maybe our order was to plain? 
Next time we will try the pastrami or Bobbie as I hear that is what they are known for...well after reading all the other reviews. Definitely would come back, but I would try something else."}
{"text":"Located inside the food court of the Red Rocks Casino.

Capriotti's is a restaurant chain.

We had the italian sausage topped with marinara, cheese, grilled sweet peppers and mushrooms. The medium size comes on a very long piece of bread and thus makes a very long sandwich. Perfect for splitting."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today and was looking forward to it with all the awards they have received.  In my opinion the sandwich I had way to much cole slaw, you cannot even taste the meat.  If I were to go back and would say light on e cole slaw"}
{"text":"Not very impressed.  I had the homemade Turkey Sub and the turkey was really dry and shredded.  Imagine the worse Thanksgiving Day Dinner you ever had and throw it on a bun with two tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, provolone cheese and spices.  I expected more from the sandwich.  I asked why they called it homemade turkey and was told they roast there turkeys every night...seems like someone overcooked this bird.  

They have an award winning sandwich called the Bobbie but it kind of seemed gross...imagine someone taking your leftovers from Thanksgiving and throwing it on a bun...shredded turkey, stuffing, mayo and cranberries...you lost me at the cranberries.  I did not have this sandwich but the description seemed gross.  Someone must like it because someone gave it an award!!!"}
{"text":"We were super excited to go to capriottis today and picking up 12 sandwiches for our groups picnic. We arrived 5 minutes before 10am the door was cracked open so we walk in. The older man says 10:00 guys.  We said OK 5 more minutes ok. Thinking he was going to ask us to have a seat. He said again 10:00 guys again. We said on the door was open. So we go outside.we hear them quickly lock the door behind us. We waited until 10:07am and just left because they did not open up. It was just like saying we do not want to do our job.... rediculous!  I have always loved capriottis. Now I'm very disappointed."}
{"text":"The veggie turkey \"meat\" is so good. The best I've had. Yay for having good vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"I hate it when you go to a sandwich shop let's say for example subway and they skimp when constructing your sub. Once upon a time a friend of mine worked at subway and I did not know it was physically possible to put that much meat in a sandwich until he manned the counter. Ahhh good times and Capriotti's keeps the good times rolling.

Shared the  12' Capastrami and seeing as I was extremely reluctant to order a sandwich with a large amount of cole slaw I can say that I was thoroughly converted by the Cap. The meat was plentiful and the combination of the pastrami and cole slaw was superb.

As I suggested they really load the sandwich and give you a bang for your buck.

Biggest drawback is it's no where near the strip out in no man's land. My friends and I dropped by upon leaving a none of your business weekend in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ohhhh myyyy..the Bobbie.. Lived in Vegas and so took Caps for granted . Now living in Idaho - NO CAPRIOTTI'S.  While on business in Phoenix, called them for delivery - fantastic customer service, super quick delivery all the way into my resort, and the taste was EXACTLY how I remembered.  Thanks guys - great experience!!"}
{"text":"If you love a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, then order \"The Bobby\".  This is THE BEST sandwich EVER.  I could eat it everyday.  It tastes exactly like Thanksgiving dinner.  Thick turkey pieces, cranberry sauce, stuffing.  It is heaven.  I order the largest size so I can eat it 3 days in a row.  

We call ahead so our order is ready when we arrive.  Friendly service.

Small interior so it's best for take out.  Could use a good cleaning."}
{"text":"12inches of Bobbie goodness! The sandwich cost $8.65. This place is a bit more expensive than other Capriotti's because of the location inside of the Red Rock Hotel.  

The Bobby is Thanksgiving on a hoagie! Roast turkey, mayo, stuffing, and cranberry sauce. My go to sandwich. 

Naps are optional but encouraged."}
{"text":"I'm a fan because of the sheer size of their sandwiches!  One can easily feed 2 people for lunch.  And the associate or manager let us keep the sandwich that the other worker messed up on and apologized.  

What I had: the Italian sausage, SlawBeJo, and the Italian
*Italian sausage- with bell peppers and melted cheese and side of marinara. Yum.
*SlawBeJo- not as great..plenty of coleslaw, hint of meat..not satisfying to my palate.  A lot of sauce from the coleslaw.
*Italian- and I must say, I'd definitely order the Italian again!  The fixings and blend of onion and seasonings that went on ALL sandwiches went incredibly well with the meats of the Italian.  Sooo good.

BTW, sandwiches especially ones with coleslaw, probably aren't good next day. No one likes soggy bread."}
{"text":"I came and was immediately greeted. My order was taken by I'm believe Jeremy or Savino by what the ticket tells me. He created a nice convo and that's great  customer service. He was very humble and polite. I was impressed because lately in other establishments there's a lack of compassion for customer service. Overall I'm impressed and the management at this facility seems to have trained their employees well! I hope that it will remain the same when I return again.



Update: well got home to eat my Bobbie and found a bone in my food. Could've pierced my gums bad..  I wish I could rate this only on customer service but getting hurt by a bone isn't really appealing."}
{"text":"Had a coworker highly recommend this sandwich shop. Said their rolls made the sandwich. 

After growing up in New Jersey, I had to see if what he was telling me was legit. Because I have had good subs outside of NJ but none as good. 

I ordered a 9\" Italian and a 9\" chicken cheese steak. And no I didn't eat both at the same time. I did eat the chicken one first since it was a hot sandwish. The chicken was mated with peppers, grilled onions, and tomatoes.  I will have to give it to them, it was good and feeling.  Later on i had a couple bites of the Italian. It comprised of salami, ham, lettuce, tomato that was covered with olive oil and oregano. I think i like the flavors a little bit better on that sandwish. 

Prices are reasonable and i will definitely be going back. It's not NJ sub sandwish good but they do put up a good competition."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Capriotti's  in a while, so I thought I'd give them a try. Disappointment from the beginning. No one greeted you when you walked in. I wasn't sure where I ordered, because the only sign  visible was \"online/pick-up\". So I asked and was directed to the \"Online/pick-up\" area. 

I decided to order a small home turkey. I asked if mayo was on the sandwich. I was told it wasn't and I confirmed that I did NOT want mayo. Also, I asked for no tomato (I know, I'm weird). 

While waiting around I notice the place looked dirty and poorly maintained. 

The staff seemed rushed and genuinely lame.
I realize you're making sandwiches, but when a customer says \"happy Friday\", at the very least, smile! 

Alas, i get home to eat my sandwich, and find the following:
1. Mayo
2. Tomatoes
3. Old wilted lettuce

So, needless to say I am disappointed and won't me back."}
{"text":"The staff is so professional, kind and upbeat. Very clean restaurant. My sandwich is always special ordered and the got it perfect t!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Havnt had a chance to eat my sandwich yet but the one girl in the sunset store was so rude i know im not going back again after she charged me extra for sandwiches i didnt order and had to fix my order a few times i asked if they gave any military discounts to combat veterans she responded \"why do they deserve a discount\" my receipt name said javon but she was the only girl working there at the tine lost my buisness and anyone i can tell to people die everyday for your freedom dont ever forget that"}
{"text":"was good enough bread.  As a vegetarian i can't say anything about the meat.  Produce was standard enough.  The staff is friendly enough.  A little better quality food than subway type sandwiches so worth a little more as reflected in price.  Still feel like its fair for the food.  Worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop out here in Vegas. Can't get enough! What I believe to be an authentic ny style with a high counter and it always feels bustling even if you are the only one there. The staff at this location is very friendly and always greet me by name (tell you that I frequent this deli much? Yeah well I'm not embarrassed I love the subs!) I usually call in my order and no matter what its always ready by the time I get there. (even if it's smack dab in the middle of lunch hour and they are only five mins from my home!)"}
{"text":"The best cheese steak in town.  I know a lot of people rant and rave about pops cheese steaks,  but what make capriotti's the best is that is cooked to order. At pops they cooked it a head of time and sits  in a bucket to keep it warm so it looses the freshness and drys out when the cook it a second time for your sandwich.  They are both great sandwiches but capriotti's is the most consistent with flavor every time and will win my business 90% of the time."}
{"text":"First time for me. Ordered the Bobby, turkey,stuffing and cranberry sauce. It was very good. My only issue was the stuffing was cold. I nuked my second half and it was delicious. So, Capriottis, if you read this review, slap that stuffing on the grill for a minute or two! The hot stuffing and turkey, with cold cranberries is fantastic. I will go back and try another sandwich. Maybe the Philly cheese steak. I lived in So. Jersey for years, hubby and I miss a good steak sandwich. Try them, they're pretty good!"}
{"text":"You gotta try the bobbie sandwich .. It's like a fresh bite of thanksgiving .. Glad I found this place."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's vegetarian food. :) Their vegetarian cheese 'steak' sub is great. I had their vegetarian 'turkey' sub in the past and their veggie burger. They are good as well."}
{"text":"I love This place I really do but when I go in line and wait for literally 26 minutes and then someone who got there after me got their food before me is ridiculous.. Don't go to this location they were also blasting some 2 pac... Not really professional"}
{"text":"Although, you may be on hold for a little bit when you call in your order, it is worth the wait.  At times, they can be really busy and you could be on hold for awhile but other than that they do their job.  There was just one time I was on hold for a pretty long time, at least 10 minutes.  I ended up hanging up because I did not want to wait anymore.  The customer service could be a little better. I only go to this one because it is the nearest one to my house and it's really convenient. 

I always get the 20 inch Bobbie for $14.29 (tax not included).  I think it is well worth getting the largest one because I can have it for multiple meals. I always get a take out order and they always get my food ready on time. They always make the sandwich perfect every time, pretty consistent which is good."}
{"text":"Ever since my boyfriend showed me Capi's I have been absolutely obsessed with the Bobbie!  The Bobbie is SO GOOD it's the perfect combination of turkey, mayo, cranberry sauce, and stuffing.  Literally Thanksgiving between two slices of bread!!  The bread is soft and seriously perfect!  Since this location is the closest to where I live I usually always go here.  I always grab a Bobbie! Since I'm so faithful to the Bobbie, I haven't tried their other sandwiches.

Customer service was alright, the lady taking orders was busy wrapping sandwiches and taking people's orders.  She greeted me as I walked in and told me to wait because she was going to ring up the people that were there before me first.  I waited about 3 minutes and I was helped quickly.  I paid for my order, a large Bobbie since my boyfriend and I share a large.  It is definitely a large, totally worth $13.99!! The biggest size they have.  I wish they had an extra large because I would definitely buy that! My boyfriend and I finish one large Bobbie in two meals."}
{"text":"Today I tried Capriottis for the first time based on other Yelp reviews.  I got the medium size Bobbie (12 in) which is large enough to split into two meals.  I was disappointed after the first bite as the sandwich was cold, the bread was cold and soft.  Tasted just like unheated leftover Thanksgiving food.  So after a disappointing bite, I placed the sandwich in the toaster oven for 10 min.  The sandwich tasted so much better after being heated up with the bread warm and slightly crispy.  This is where my 4 stars come in.  If I didn't heat up the bread, I would probably give 3 stars based on taste as it came from the shop.  3.5 stars?

UPDATE:  I've been back several times and tried the Capistrami and Cheese steak sandwiches.  I absolutely love both BUT only after first putting them in a toaster oven for 5 minutes to make the bread lightly crispy and warm.  They're really delish fresh out of the oven but that's not how it is prepared when you get them at the restaurant where the bread is soft and cold.  Upgrading it to 5 stars.  I would knock off half point if I can mainly for not heating up the bread."}
{"text":"When you work on the far west side and forget your lunch at home as frequently as I do... what? OK, I'll start over. When you work on the far west side and you're too lazy to pack a lunch, you get kind of tired of the Milio's across the street from the office. The Cousins down the road is fine, but there's one of those near home for the days when you forget to buy groceries for dinner (yeah, yeah... or you're just too damn lazy to make it). 

What's left, then, for your traditional sandwich lunch? Capriotti's, of course! Located in a clean, newish space on Junction Road, this place boasts a friendly staff and good selection of sandwich choices. My favorites are the Capastrami (haven't tried it? you haven't lived), the Bobbie (with the pulled turkey and dressing and cranberries, it's Thanksgiving every day sans a Detroit Lions loss) and the cheese steak (add the hots and sweets, or forget it). 

The service isn't as fast as, say, Subway, but that is offset by the fact that they don't serve sandwiches that taste like cardboard. It's fast enough -- I can drive over, order my sandwich, and get back to my desk without being out of the office for 30 minutes. 

4 stars on the sandwich shop scale. If they had a punch card, I'd eat a lot of free subs."}
{"text":"We've had two take-out orders from this shop in the past two weeks and both times have been fantastic.  They are a chain, and this shop on Baseline, at Val Vista, is a great addition to the Dana Landing/Dana Park shopping center.

The sandwiches are pricey, but they are also huge, which makes them a good deal.  The small is 9\" and is filling enough for a large man.  We've been getting the medium, 12\", and getting two meals out of each sandwich.  And I haven't been hungry enough to think about getting the 20\" large yet, but the sandwiches are so good, I wouldn't hesitate to get one if I was!

I've had the Capastrami and the Bobbie.  Both were awesome.  The Bobbie is their signature sandwich and it sounds weird, with fresh, shredded turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce, but like another review said, it's like Thanksgiving in a sandwich!

The Bobbie not a hot sandwich though, and the Capastrami is!  Piles of pastrami with creamy cole slaw filling in, wow, it's a great flavor combination!  My wife had the hot meatball sub and that did not disappoint either, on that fresh, soft, chewy roll with lots of sauce and cheese.

I don't usually love sandwiches, they're okay, I just don't love them.  But these sandwiches really are winners and I can't wait to go back and try the others!"}
{"text":"It's such a shame because my husband loves this place and they actually have a vegetarian option for me but every time we order, they get our order wrong. Whether you're in person or order online where you literally spell out what you want...every time it's wrong. And no offense, but for the price, you should be able to get a simple sandwich order correct."}
{"text":"This place is great. Fairly fast. Reasonable prices. Very tasty !"}
{"text":"I love that they offer a veggie turkey sandwich. It tastes great and I don't know of any other place that offers it.

However, parking is a total nightmare at this place. So, I was happy to find out that they do curbside. BUT it would really helpful if they would ask the customer over the phone whether they are paying with cash or credit. That way if all you have is a card, the number can be taken over the phone. Instead, when I pick up my sandwich, I am made to feel terrible that I'm paying with a card and the employee running the curbside makes it VERY clear that she is unhappy to run back to the shop to swipe my card. 

The food is good but a paying customer should never be made to feel this way."}
{"text":"The manager can over to every table and asked how the food was. When the manager \"Michael\" as he introduced himself to me as he also asked me how my food was I responded that I my Italian sub was great. I mentioned that I noticed how his employees looked very happy to be working there and his establishment was very clean. I thanked him for the great service. I will come in more often to receive great service and great sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love eating at Capriotti's but the last couple of visits have been bad. I ordered asandwich on the phone, came home and had a  totally different sandwich. Okay mistakes happen I understand. Today I came in order sandwich on the phone and they told me to be ready in 15-20 minutes. I show up and I pay but for some unknown reason my sandwich that I just paid for it grew legs and walked out of the restaurant!! Two people working there. A young lady started looking at the guy she writes with and said where's the sandwich? I know I made it. Then she says maybe the delivery driver took it. The young man responded and said the driver has been gone for 45 minutes. She frantically started to make me a sandwich immediately even though I called ahead of time. She could have said let me upgrade you to a bigger sandwich or the next one is on us or something! Point is go somewhere else. It just seems it's a mistake upon mistake upon mistake. If you're okay with it then this is your place to eat!! I'm going to search a different Capriotti's."}
{"text":"Not great, but not bad, either.  Big kudos for being a sandwich shop with some vegetarian options.  I had the veggie steak sandwich with peppers and onions, and it wasn't bad.  Sandwiches are not as good as That's a Wrap, but then it's a chain, so I didn't expect the same level of care.  Prices are a bit high for sandwiches.  For a couple bucks more I could go to the Vig next door, and actually eat cheaper at the Vig for happy hour.  

The bagel shop that's attached is also 3-star.  Three bagel shops in a three-mile radius now."}
{"text":"The sandwich is such a good deal if you get the 20\" sub. I got the turkey sandwich the first time and added vinegar and oil as dressing. The turkey was very dry and needed a pastier or more liquid dressing to season but the vegetables on the sandwich were fresh and complemented the vinegar and oil well. The second time I got the Italian sausage with mushrooms. This took a while to come out but the taste was worth the wait. The sauce was a fresh tomato paste that was warm and tangy on the greasy and delicious sausage. The mushrooms were a great add since it creates a certain texture and flavor that  swirls in the mouth well. The bread both times was soft and great tasting as it is white bread. The decor and place itself are a bit drab but I think they expect people to take it out more often than not. This sandwich place is very delicious and I would recommend it."}
{"text":"these people couldn't build a sandwich if their lives depended on it.
their idea of building a sandwich consist of quantity over quality . simply put, and don't get me going on their Italian sandwich!"}
{"text":"What a consistently busy location for lunch, all the way to dinner. Quite amazing. Careful in the small parking lot with all the traffic and commotion.

Standard clean Cappriotti's. The cook DJ was so friendly and grills with flair. He also remembers all the regulars name."}
{"text":"Located in the Red Rocks casino by the theaters. Quick service. Can use your Station points to pay. Heavy sub sandwiches. Do a yelp check in for a drink. Join their club."}
{"text":"Its a smaller sized sit in Capriotti's located in a   small strip mall. Lots of parking. Interior is a little worn, but we're here for the dependable sub sandwiches, right? And they were the same, as expected turkey and roast beef sandwiches. Love the chip selection.

Right now, buy a $25 gift card and get a $5 coupon for yourself."}
{"text":"Typically friendly good sandwich sub place specializing in turkey subs. Joined their club and I get credit towards a free foot long and also occassional food offers. This day got a free drink and chips with my sub purchase.

This location has easy parking. No restrooms."}
{"text":"This location is open 24/7, which is great when you get the late night munchies. My first time at Capriotti's; very good Cheesesteak, except that it hardly has any cheese! The Pastrami was excellent!!"}
{"text":"I don't agree if it's the BEST sandwiches around but they are certainly the biggest and thistly, the most filling.  Great customer service.  Wouldn't hesitate to come back."}
{"text":"This is the worst capriottis ive been to. They took over 20 to make a vegetarian cheese steak and turns out the sandwich was filled with chicken which made me sick. They denied that it was chicken and we had to leave. I will never get a sandwich from this place ever again."}
{"text":"Yesterday was the first time I tried Capriotti's. I ordered the Bobbie sandwich for carry out, and it was absolutely amazing. I haven't had a sandwich that good in a very long time. The service was also very good and they were very fast. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"I love this place. The employees are always really friendly and they don't have a sub combination that is anything less than awesome. 

If I had to choose favorites it would be The Bobby and The Capastrami. The Bobby is basically a Thanksgiving sandwich. The key is that they start with fresh roasted turkey, not turkey lunch meat. Then they layer on stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo. Yum! The Bobby is always my mom's first meal request when she is in town. The Capistrami is mainly pastrami with Russian dressing and coleslaw."}
{"text":"Update:

I'm adding 1 star because today I attempted to redeem my free sandwich award after 10 visits with the Capriotti's App on my phone, and it SEEMS that that offer expires after 14 days? I'm still trying to get confirmation on this since the terms of that award are not obvious, but if this is the case, the app gets deleted.

The manager on duty comp'ed me a sandwich after trying to figure out what was going on with the app, hence the +1 star there. The staff and food are great, but when I walk over there to redeem my free sandwich as a \"loyal\" customer and the offer disappears like it was passing through the Bermuda Triangle, well... that's a corporate problem that I can't support."}
{"text":"I'm extremely sad to give this one star review but I feel like this is one of the only ways to get my voice heard. I love capriotti's and have been a weekly customer for the year I have lived in Las Vegas.

 Tonight I ordered my usual Chicken Cheese Steak from Capriottis, it's one of the only things I order there, other than the Bobbie. My wife picked it up on her way home, after a long day (we wanted easy dinner). When she got home she savagely ripped into her sandwich excited for the cheesey chicken goodness. She took a bite without looking only to be surprised it was beef. She spit out the bite and put it back on the plate she was eating it on. I volunteered to call and go back to the store for us and replace the sandwich. When I called and explained what happened (this has happened before, no big deal), I was asked to BRING BACK THE WRONG SANDWICH. I have had my order wrong before and this is the first i've heard of this. The town square location literally will deliver the sandwich if they get it wrong. 

Anyway, I drove back to the store with the sandwich bag and gave the guy working (really nice guy) my sandwich. He opened the bag and looked and said \"There is only half a sandwich here...\" I remembered that I only brought 1/2 the sandwich back because the other half was still sitting on the table. I said \"Ok.. well I thought the purpose was to make sure you in fact made the wrong sandwich- which you obviously did\". He then calls Carl Zwick, the \"district manager\". Carl informs him that I am only to receive half a replacement sandwich because I only brought half my sandwich back. 

ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I go to this capriotti's a couple times a month, bring all my friends there when they are in town, etc. This is how you treat your customers? 

Carl Zwick, if you read this- you really need a lesson in customer service. First of all, mistakes should be expected when you are making food- it happens. However, the mistake should be rectified with as little to no hassle for the customer. I already had to drive back to replace it, wasting more of my night. 

Is half a sandwich worth losing a repeat customer from your location?"}
{"text":"Not your typical deli meat-this is the real deal with the shredded turkey.  Very good."}
{"text":"Like ABC Stores in Honolulu, HI, there is a Capriotti's in almost every strip mall in Vegas and it's surrounding suburbs.  I chose this one to review because I frequent it the most.

I would love to give Capriotti's five stars but cannot.  On sandwiches, I am 2 for 3 here.  I will go from worst to best.

The Bobbie.  I know that this is what Capriotti's is known for, but it is not a good interpretation of Thanksgiving on a bun.  When I had it, the texture is off-putting.  There is just too much mush.  The sandwich is okay, but when you have mushy stuffing, wet cranberry sauce, extra mayo, and mushy bread (because of wet cranberry sauce), all you get is mush.  Sorry Bobbie, but you are not the one for me.

The Italian.  This is salty goodness.  Delicious Italian cold cuts, pepper relish, slaw, and great bread.  Enough said.

The champ at Capriotti's: THE CAPISTRAMI !  Make sure to get it with the PEPPER RELISH (so damn good) and the Russian Dressing on the side so that you can dunk the sandwich in it.  No offense to the Bobbie, but if you try one sandwich at Capriotti's, make love to yourself and get the Capastrami.

Make sure you get off the strip and enjoy Capriotti's!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is good.  The bread is soft and fluffy, coleslaw is out of this world, and the pastrami... Is on another level. BOMB."}
{"text":"This is a solid 3.5.

The sandwiches are fine.  I usually get an Italian-- I haven't tried the Bobbie, but my wife has.  She likes it, but has never raved about it. Meats and cheeses aren't premium, but they're a solid level or two over what you'd get at a Subway.  Maybe I'm spoiled by Which 'Wich, but I always feel like they could use a few more options... roasted red peppers perhaps?

My major complaint is the bread.  It's not awful, but it's certainly not outstanding. It's always a bit on the dry and mealy side.  It's simply not possible to make a great sandwich without great bread, and this isn't great bread.

Other complaints:
- the price is a little bit high
- the service is a little bit slow, whether eating in or ordering delivery. It took close to an hour to get a delivery order, even though I'm not very far away.
- They're only open until 8. It seems to me that a place that delivers sandwiches ought to be open later.

It's a solid option for a decent sandwich, and I'll definitely be back at some point, but I'm not terribly excited by the prospect."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sandwich shop in Vegas. Always quick and good service. They always enjoy when you give them a tip they shout out \"beer money\" it's a fun environment. We always get our sandwiches very fast and the rewards are amazing as well. Sandwiches are always fresh and yummy. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches! I got a cheesesteak with sweet peppers, mushrooms, & onions. Very yummy. I ordered the small & it was too big, I was only able to eat half. The restaurant wasn't super clean so I'm giving it four stars. The trash was overflowing & the tables & chairs needed to be wiped down. They weren't busy."}
{"text":"Got their chicken cheesesteak sandwich which I was happy to see since I don't eat beef.  Not the best one I've ever had (phillies best in CA is best outside Philly) but pretty good. The hot peppers were actually spicy.  Loved that! Friendly service."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop on the planet!!!  Of special note (to me) were their amazing vegetarian items, veggie cheese steak, WOW!  Meat choices were even more amazing.  The Bobbie looked insane.  This will be a regular stop for me, keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Friendly greeting .. Somewhat pricey. It is not the World's greatest sub, as claimed. Lower price would make it greater."}
{"text":"Sitting in right now waiting for my to go order and I just had to take a moment to write a review for these guys!
I'm a manager in the food and beverage industry and this is hands down the most delightful experience I have had in quite some time and I have been here five minutes.
Allison is so sweet and helpful, the older tall gentleman that took my order was really helpful and thorough with my order to ensure I got everything I wanted and that it was correct.
Great team you guys!!
Love it and this will be my go to Capriottis from now on!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a home made Sandwich. Bread was fresh and the price was reasonable. I ordered the Bobbie 9\" sandwich. Perfect portion, fresh turkey, cranberry sauce, light mayo, and stuffing. Tasty combo... Service was excellent and the order was quick. I highly recommend this place for family and friends."}
{"text":"I haven't been here through their \"rush\" hours, so service has always been fast and friendly.  

Capastrami - Hot pastrami, Cole slaw, swiss cheese, and Russian dressing WITH sweet peppers. I can't get past ordering anything else when I come here.  Quality through and through.

One of these days I'll try their famous \"Bobbie\" (tryptophan coma here I come)... or maybe I'll just have to go Gal vs. Food and order the Capastrami AND the Bobbie (tryptophan coma and the -itis)"}
{"text":"this place has been voted by lv review journal readers as the best sandwich year after year.

i've eaten at nearly every location in las vegas and would say without a doubt they are the best. 

My wife loves this place so much one time she bit into a hair-tie in the middle of a sandwich-spit it out and kept on chowing down.

The Capistrami & Bobbie are my favorites.

The capistrami is hot pastrami with their special cole slaw & russian dressing on a fresh roll 12 or 20 inch
. 
The bobbie is a thanksgiving delight. everything on a roll. turkey,stuffing and cranberry sauce with or without mayo!!

the service is always fast & friendly. the atmosphere is that of a small-town deli/sandwich shoppe and the food is always consistent & great. a little more $$ than others but always worth it"}
{"text":"CapriCrap is what it is. 

Vegetarians avoid this place for their options are little and nasty.  The veggie Cole turkey was one of the worst sandwiches I've had in my life and the Cole portion that they give you should not be called a portion - the whole thing was a couple of spoons.  

The what's supposed to be the turkey lookalike tasted horrible and looked even worst.  Two bites and the whole thing went into the trash.

Not recommend at all"}
{"text":"Heard a lot of hooplah about this place so i decided to check it out. Ordered the cheesesteak and capistrami. The cheesesteak was just ok for me. Good amount of meat and cheese the capristrami was excellent. The slaw matched well with the perfectly seasoned pastrami. It was worth the visit. Next time ill try the Bobbie."}
{"text":"The turkey and roast beef are as real as it gets.  No carl buddig meat here folks."}
{"text":"Food is great very tasty ! Service is super quick ! You can't go wrong with choosing anything on this Menu !!!"}
{"text":"Had the pastrami. There was a lot of meat, which is important. It wasn't fatty at all and it was very tender. I wish we had these in San Jose. Only thing I would change is the bread. I like a nice crust and this bread was good but got soggy quick."}
{"text":"Best of Las Vegas? Really? Only slightly better than Subway. I would rival this with Jimmy John's."}
{"text":"i've been to other capriotti's around the town and i love this place. however this location is horrible! i usually go to the one on cheyenne and they do a fantastic job.

i called ahead for a pick up order a mushroom cheese steak sandwich. at the other locations they usually ask follow up questions about what i want on my sandwich. this place did no such thing. i had to ask about each individual item that was on the sandwich since the guy seemed so clueless.  i called at 134pm and my food wasn't ready until 154pm. the guy that took my order didn't give me a time estimate or a price estimate. 

as far as food quality. i ordered a MUSHROOM CHEESEsteak sandwich. there was barely any mushroom and almost no cheese in it. My family and i were all confused because we're used to the other location that produces higher quality sandwiches. My sister thought that they left the mushroom out but I did see 3 pieces in my piece. 

why are they skimping on the cheese on a cheesesteak sandwich? FAIL

why are they skimping on the mushroom they charged me $1.00 extra for? 

never coming back here again. i'll stick to the other locations that have delicious sandwiches"}
{"text":"Eating the bobbie sandwich is like Thanksgiving inside of a sub! Its a must whenever I'm here."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options for subs. The bread is fresh and very good. They have vegetarian turkey from Worthington or better than meat for the philly cheese steak or morning star farms if you would like. Fresh veggies on it as well. Great vegetarian options. Recommended"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. My lunch was 40 minutes late. I called at 10 minutes late. The manager put me on hold when he answered. When he came back he advised me my food was late because the website shouldn't allow you to pick a delivery time... I didn't pick a time, I went with the time auto populated by their website. He also advised me that he only employs one delivery driver, all orders wait for that one driver to come back from the last round of deliveries. When the driver arrived he said the same thing. My warm sandwiches were cold, my salads were warm and wilted. I threw one of them away without eating it, the lettuce was disgusting. Order from anyone else. This place has bad service and food. I did their survey for free food and didn't even write down the code. Even free this place is overpriced for what you really get."}
{"text":"Always amazing!  Best Capriotti's Iv been too.  The bobbie wins me over everytime!  I even ate it three days in a row last week!"}
{"text":"I friggin love the Bobbi- will make sure to stop in here everytime im in Vegas!  Mmmmm... yum!"}
{"text":"Capriottis is good...don't get me wrong but what gets me going back to a place is the staff and the service they give.  
Once in a while I crave the SLAW BEJO and the BOBBIE.  This particular place is nearby my home and makes it convenient to order here and take my goody home to enjoy in front of the telly.
When it first opened, I remember the guy that helped me.....tall, goatee...and I don't know if he has teeth cuz he never smiles.  (lol jk).
I remember now that he was not friendly and I didn't want to go there again.  
Well.....it's been a while and I guess I forgot how sucky the customer service is there.  
Went there again and for the last time.  The same guy was still working there and still no smile...trying to rush me when I was trying to decide what to order.  When he was finished....rang up my stuff...NOT A THANK YOU....I was signing the receipt and he practically yanked it from me cuz I was trying to figure out which receipt to keep and which to give.  I should have said right there and then I wanted my $$$ back.  I should have gotten his name also.  But I will not forget his face that's for sure.  --and I will remember to NOT PATRONIZE this one sandwich shop.  I will take the time to drive somewhere farther for GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE and a smile.  
For those who do not care.....this is the place to go for SUCKY SERVICE."}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on many foods, but I'm a certified expert on Cheesesteaks. I tried a ton in Vegas for lunch and this is the clear winner... A distant second is Cugino. Not only is the bread perfect for a sub, but the American cheese is so damn flavorful and creamy. Also huge points for having sweet peppers - when I asked the guy at Cugino he had no idea what I meant. Makes a sub so much better.
Don't forget that you can order online, so fast."}
{"text":"This location is the best in Vegas. You can actually sit down and eat lunch on tables and chairs and not leave smelling like meat. I like Capriotti's but wish the other locations had better seating like this one. 
This location was very clean and doesn't make me feel like a dirty trucker eating at the counter. This is also a convenient meeting spot when I'm meeting clients in Southern Highlands.
I first loved the Bobbi, Thanksgiving in a sandwich sans the \"moist maker\" aka gravy (for you Friends fans), then went to their meatball... S. Highlands has the BEST meatball...tender, and just really fresh tasting, then I tried the Capistrami...not a fan at first because there was just too much going on, but then I learned how to order it right...hot peppers in the pastrami, extra swiss cheese, and hold the Russian dressing because the coleslaw is enough. Delish!
I know they have good cheese steaks but I like making my own at home.
Depending on the other locations, you better be prepared for errors and omissions on your orders...especially if you call it in."}
{"text":"Food is great, it's Capriotti's, you can't go wrong there, the only issue I have with this location is the customer service, don't believe me? Give them a call to place an order and see for yourself, I've only been to this location twice, both times everybody who worked there seemed pretty upset to be there,  at my 2nd visit I let it slide when I was practically hung up on while placing my order, but when I went in to pay and the guy working took my card, sat my sandwich on the counter and walked away, I had to write a review"}
{"text":"I love cappriottis however this location, not so much. The cheesesteaks was blah, barely any meat, probably less than half of the usual cheesesteak sandwich I usually get and had no flavor at all. I had to add a ton of salt n pepper to have some taste to my cardboard sandwich. I hate how it's the closest to my house. I hope they really step up their game or perhaps retrain the sandwich makers."}
{"text":"the philly steak with cheese and mushroom is absolutely amazing! first time trying this place. its really really good. great customer service. toasted the bread extra for me upon my request. will definitely go back to eat there."}
{"text":"Went here twice and asked for specific ingredients on my sandwich. Three sandwiches and they can't do this. Probably the stupidest people I've ever dealt with in my entire life. That's what I get for asking people who make sandwiches for a living to make a fucking sandwich. This place should be closed down, can't imagine why anyone would want to eat here."}
{"text":"I went in for a sandwich and I asked for it on sliced bread. They told me, \"We can't do that.\" What do you mean? You mean to tell me you can't do sliced bread? 
\"We can't do that because it's not on the menu.\" 

I can't begin to tell you how flabbergasted this leaves me.

They agreed to put it on sliced bread, because it's a sandwich shop and that's ridiculous. I then asked if they had chili paste, as every other Capriotti's I've been to does. The cashier proceeded to tell me oh no, the soup of the day isn't chili. 

I had to leave. I couldn't deal with it. I love Capriotti's, just not this one."}
{"text":"Every single time I've gone in here they mess up my sandwich. I don't understand how a veggie turkey sandwich is that hard? Some of the dumbest people on the planet are employed by this whole chain. You're better off shoving a loaf of dry bread into your mouth and burning $8. You'll feel the same after both. About every six months I eat here to remind myself why I shouldn't eat here."}
{"text":"A few of my coworkers love this place and say it's better than Jason's Deli so I had to try it.  The pastrami is off the hizzle.  Most pastrami is fatty, overstuffed, and makes the bread soggy.  This pastrami comes from cows with six packs.  Good stuff indeed."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Awesome food.  Must eat?? I can here and say great reviews. I was even more impressed when I walked in. Everything is made to order. They have a nice set up. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"First timer
Friendly staff
Quick 
I loved the the Bobbie they use real turkey that they cook in the restaurant instead of cold cuts. 
I really don't think I'll ever eat subway again. 
Only thing, the Bobbie would be even better served warm."}
{"text":"Mmm mmm mmm good! This place is awesome! The meat is soo fresh, actually everything is! The bread is nice and soft. Fresh ingredients, fresh bread, fresh everything! Waaayyy better than subway! They are also nice and friendly here! Great restaurant, great customer service. Will definitely be back :)!"}
{"text":"I've been anxiously awaiting for Capriotti's to open up on Mill for about a month now since I saw the \"Coming Soon\" signs plastered on the bottom floor of the Chase Bank building on the corner of University and Mill. Working in the predominantly college town of Tempe, AZ, I'm always looking for new and exciting lunch options as I've found my surroundings to grow a bit stale.

Capriotti's could be that new exciting spot but it also might not. 

Pros:
Monster size subs (a small sub is 9\".) Like seriously, find someone with similar tastes to you and split one, you'll be fine, I promise.
Fresh tasty bread
Nice array of toppings and extras (unlike Jimmy John's down the street where you can have it their way or you can F off)
Fairly quick

Cons:
No onsite parking
$7 for a \"Small\" turkey sandwich is a little steep
Turkey is mixed white and dark meat???

The last Con is definitely the one that will determine whether or not Capriotti's is the game changer I've been waiting for ever since my beloved Rinaldi's Deli fell victim to the Lightrail construction off of Mill & 3rd St. I don't like dark meat, I won't do dark meat, and until you find a way to separate that ish out, I can't partake in an otherwise quite tasty turkey sandwich. Charge me extra for all white meat, I don't care, I'll deal with it. I've never had dark meat turkey at a deli before today and I don't plan on repeating it.

I would be willing to go back and try a few of their other options like the meatball sub which looked pretty decent, but a deli that can't master the simple but oh so delicious turkey sandwich is going to be hard for me to love and appreciate in the long haul."}
{"text":"Second time I came here and left disappointed. I love Capriottis, and love the product. I will never have a problem paying for what I'm asking for. But this is the second time I came and paid for what I wanted and did not get what I payed for. Both times, a young lady working here confidently and boldly tells me yes I am getting what I asked for. However I both times I did not receive what I payed for. The first time a couple weeks ago, I purchased a MD Chicken cheese steak and I got the sandwich on a 9 inch cut roll. I asked if my order was right knowing it was not right and a young lady told me yes it's a 12inch roll they just had to cut a LG roll down to size. But it was a 12inch roll. It simply was not. I payed for a MD with double meat and cheese only. Again the price was not the issue, what I was served was the issue. I simply do not receive what I payed for.


I gave them another shot today, I purchased a SM Chicken cheese steak again with double meat. I payed close to $12 which again was not the issue, I questioned if it was double meat after opening and examining my sandwich. I believe the same young lady boldly and confidently answered YES it is. I'm not one to argue, but unless your portion size for a small chicken cheesesteak Chicken and cheese only is 3oz's bringing a double meat to 6oz's then again this is the second time I did not receive what I payed for. Bottom line is I was disappointed again at the same location. I will continue to go to Capriotti's I just will not be back to this location on Sunset and Marks st in Henderson NV.

Just give your customer what you are charging them for and what they want and are paying for. And if you are questioned about something sold, show concern not just a cocky answer."}
{"text":"My new capriotti's got what I paid for and it was awesome worth every cent! Small chicken cheesesteak double meat and I paid for exactly what I got. These guys here are on point! 3981 E Sunset got my returning business every visit! Friendly crew and great food"}
{"text":"Love this hole in wall place! =) 

Veggie Cheese Steak: 5 stars
Toasty & delicious, so tasty  =) The veggie chicken they had inside tasted so close to chicken that I couldn't believe it & the melted provolone cheese just gave it a delicious finish to it. 

Service: A
Great friendly service & they were so helpful too. 

Decor & Ambiance: A
Clean & chill place..great for groups/ families. 

Food: A
One of the best yummy Sandwiches that I've tasted in a long time!  =)

This place beats Subway & Quiznos outta the water! ;)"}
{"text":"Dropped by today to get a turkey sandwich. Terribly disappointed.  Turkey was dry, I could have made a better sandwich at home.  I may try again, but not with the same menu selection. Bummed"}
{"text":"There are a bunch in town but this one is close to the house. Consistantly good food and servcie. I always go with the Capistroni (hot pastrami) but I see the Bobbie (turkey, cranberry, dressing) often ordered by others i go with. Most of the sandwiches come in 9\", 12\" and 20\". The 12\" is good for lunch and a snack at home later. They have Pepsi and Sobe which is a good match for any of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place has amazing sandwiches....its a must try!!  my favorite is the sausage and peppers one."}
{"text":"My favorite Capriotti's in Las Vegas. Kind of a divvy joint but they always nail it on the sandwich and for some reason their bread always seems a little fresher. Recommend Capastrami or the Bobbie. Always stop by when I am working up north."}
{"text":"No Grill Items For 35 minutes. Sign said soups they had but we're out of the one I wanted. Staff didn't seem to care at all. Used to be better but got worse over time."}
{"text":"Capriottis. 1star, only because 0 star is not an option.
  Horrible service, terrible wait times, overpriced, and almost choked on a bone found in my cold turkey sub. The bone (which was about the size of a Monopoly property house piece) was the first of four that I found in that single sub. They should be more careful about what they are serving their customers, if they do not want a lawsuit on their hands."}
{"text":"amazing amazing amazing!!! get the bobbie sandwich!!!! it's thanksgiving in a sandwich!!! the best ive ever had!!!!"}
{"text":"Bro and I each got the cheese steak with xtra mushrooms and xtra sweet n' hot peppers. If this is even possible, I think this was the best Capriotti's that I've had. The cheese was melty, bread soft and warm, peppers were hotter here! Our sammies were perfect. Medium is plenty big enough for lunch and will keep you full most of the day. 

Note to Capriotti's corporate: Keep your current meat supplier! Do not change! (Little birdie told me you're wanting the franchisees (?) to change...) Look at Toyota - that's what happens when you change what works in favor of trying to save a buck. You change your meat supplier to corporate meat, quality declines, customers Yelp that your sammies start sucking. How many times do you need to see it in other industries, let alone with food we inges?! Just don't do it. Keep serving us the same high quality meat you're known for."}
{"text":"The \"Best Sandwich in America\" sign should probably be taken down.  Don't get me wrong; Capriottis isn't bad.  It's actually pretty good.  But the best?  Not even close.  I don't think I would even call it the best sandwich in the retail complex it's located in.

Having never eaten at any of this national chain's locations, I decided to go off the Cap's Special menu and order a Capastromi (a pastrami rueben sub).  The small is 9 inches, which is big enough for me.  The bread is soft and tasty, but the pastrami is a little over peppered, and it would've been nice if there were more meat.  Very good.  But not the \"Best\" of anything.

The employees were friendly.  The seating area is spacious and clean.  There are two TV's playing ESPN and CNN in mute.  There's also a few tables located right outside, which would be pleasant spots to eat on a nice day.  Caprioittis may not be the \"best\" that it boasts, but I would certainly eat here again."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this joint as long as it's a good location - the catering is on point & reasonable prices - all the sandwiches are fantastic & the bread is great considering we're in Vegas! Unfortunately they are individually owned so be sure to go to a decent location - I strongly suggest try'n their signature sammy the Bobby (turkey dinner on a sammich) or the steak & cheese - recently tried the turkey Cole which has Russian dressing & Cole slaw 
Knocked my Socks off! YUM!"}
{"text":"Turkey was extra dry looked and tasted like turkey chew!!!! Sandwiches were not hot cheese was hard bad day for Capriotti's!!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. If you're looking for quirky fun conversation don't bother with the employees. I mean after all....they are just there to handcraft an awesome sandwich with taste and diversity. Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"I accidentally ordered sandwiches from the wrong Capriotti's. Paul was awesome in handling my refund."}
{"text":"My first day at Vegas, I searched trusted yelp to find a good place to eat lunch. To my excitement, I found a 5 star rated sandwich shop.
I tried 3 kinds of the most popular sandwich, The Bobbie, Capastrami and Slaw Bejo. I have only one word to describe the food, \"disappointing.\" Although sandwiches are not my favorite type of food, I know how a good sandwich should taste like. The picture of The Bobbie look much better than the real thing, and the ingredients was very imbalanced. The turkey and the stuffing was dry, cranberry wasn't cranberry but a mush of sugar and overall a sub par sandwich. Then I sampled the Capastrami. This was probably the best out of the three. The hot pastrami was not as juicy as a Langer's sandwich but has their own distinct flavor. However, the sweetness of the cole slaw overpowered the meat, leaving you tasting only the cold, tough bread. On the whole, there was noting special.  The worst one was the Slaw Bejo which has no flavor and the roast beef just taste like bland, uncooked meat. That was the worst sandwich I have had for a while. I guess that's the reason why I lost money after lunch..."}
{"text":"Ever had a sandwich so good you bit your lip while eating it and you don't care, you just keep going?? That's what the Bobbie will do to you!"}
{"text":"Stupid....... ............ Don't never ever think abt going here. I wasted my $8.50 today for a turkey , thought of trying after reading other reviews. I donno they kept expired meat & it stinks. No f....ng taste. 
I don't wanna give a single star also. Don't waste ur money & time. Suckers!

Give me my money back !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Second visit to the location and they still haven't improved. Please train your staff to recognize that XT Russian means EXTRA RUSSIAN but no.... these incompetent people did place any Russian dressing on the sandwich. Then ordered a balsamic chicken salad and received BBQ Turkey salad. I'm freaken DONE with this location. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!"}
{"text":"i love this place. i buy my dinner here most of the time. place is not crowded and u can just call in ur order for pick up. the people who worked there were very nice and friendly. the capastrami is delicious. but most of there menu is actually really good. capriotti's... good food, reasonable price, excellent service... you cant ask for anything more."}
{"text":"SHIP THE BOBBIE all day long.  a place a lil far from everything but worth the drive.  love the portion size and the taste is amazing as well.  summer is coming along where i take my annual 2 month vegas trip and will be here soon!!! see ya soon capriottis!!!"}
{"text":"Pre-text: My husband and I had never been up this far in Henderson. The only reason we were up here was because we had been hiking at Sloan Canyon and we were both very hungry after our hike. Yay for Cap's!

This Cap's is located in a shopping mall in a very Western part of Henderson, nestled among golf courses, country clubs, and from what I could tell, rather expensive housing. It's a nice area. The Cap's is nice too, clean, with a long wooden counter and a bar to eat at. 

The gentlemen working were very nice, clever individuals who continually yelled, \"Hey, we got beer money!\" whenever anyone tipped them. So, of course, I tipped them too. Good tactic.

As for the food, I ordered a medium Capastrami, which I looooove. The meat is so tender, absolutely amazing flavor. This is the way it is at all the Cap's in town. But this one may have been a tad better because I had just been on a hike. My husband got his go-to The Bobbie. 

We got some drinks and a bag of chips and ate outside on one of their two tables and then we both ate the rest of our sandwiches at home for dinner! Ha! Thanks for two meals Cap's!"}
{"text":"I eat Capriotti's on occasion. It is not my favorite sandwich place. Sorry, that kind of repeat customer business of mine goes to Port of Subs.

This Capriotti's is pretty much the only one located on my side of town (East Side). It happens to be located in a decent shopping center though, one that is much newer than the surrounding area. The place is SMAAAAALLLL. Although I've noticed that with quite a few Cap's. I think their main idea must be, get this sandwich and get outta here.

My fiance and I arrived here in the afternoon one day of the week and there were a few other customers. He got the Bobbie and I opted for the Philly Cheese Steak and was enticed into adding peppers - NEVER AGAIN. And never again will I order the Philly Cheese Steak! MEH! The steak was definitely overcooked and the peppers were way too overpowering. I wouldn't even order it without the peppers. I'm sticking to the Bobbie or one of their cold-cut sandwiches.

Overall I like Cap's, but it is kind of on the pricey side and on more than one visit I've been kind of disappointed (not just this location).

This location was clean though and the employees were nice guys too. If I was rating just based off service, this would probably be a 4-star, but I have to take the fact that the sandwich really was not all that good into consideration."}
{"text":"This place is small, located in the strip mall on Craig, next to the Pets Mart. After picking up some doggy items my boyfriend and I stopped here to grab some sandwiches to go on a Saturday afternoon.

I went in to order while my boyfriend kept our four-legged friend busy outside where they have some tables set up for out-door eating. Um, too bad it stinks outside right around the area of the store though. Definitely not appetizing to eat sandwiches around a sewer-like smell.

I have given Capriotti's a 5-Star Review before, but this was kind of \"meh\". I'm bumping it up to 3-Stars though because the Bobbie was yummy per usual. Unlike a lot of people, I'm not a regular at Capriotti's because I'm more of a Port of Subs girl for my go-to sandwich. However, Capriotti's hits the spot sometimes.

This location is tiny by the way and there's not much seating to speak of inside. Also, the set up to pay/get your sandwich/get your drinks is a little clumsy to say the least."}
{"text":"Well this is a place that despite its oddly arranged seating and small space is going to do well at Town Square. I honestly cannot remember what was here before Capriotti's, but can we really remember many of the unmemorable, poorly thought out, and down-right bad places that have opened up at Town Square? The place seems cursed, save for Yard House. BUT I believe Capriotti's WILL survive, if only based on the fact it is a chain that delivers good food and it is a name that will have people flock to it no matter what.

I happened upon Cap's while I was shopping today and had two things in mind. 1. Getting some food and 2. Escaping the heat. I wandered to Cap's and entered. The place is tiny and cramped. There is bar seating and a few tables. No matter how busy this place gets, it is not going to hold many people, but I've noticed that about a lot of Capriotti's - small places, limited seating.

I received the Capastrami (Small) and a small fountain drink, which I had to shimmy to the back of the place to fill up. There is room for exactly one person in front of the soda machine so be prepared to wait if the place is busy. 

My sandwich came out quickly and was delicious as usual. Cap's uses the finest meats and the best ingredients, that's why their sandwiches taste so good (save for a burnt Philly Cheese Steak I had once). 

If I'm in Town Square and need a quick bite, this will probably now be my go-to. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is again, the tiny space and the necessity to squeeze around people to get to the soda fountain."}
{"text":"How can I not give 5 stars when a sandwich shop serves up a sandwich I'm still thinking about after I ate it hours ago? I'm talking about the Bobbie just like everyone else here. I had heard rumors of this delicious sandwich but I was skeptical.

Thank you Capriotti's for delivering on the promise of Thanksgiving in a  sandwich! I think the thing that it did for me was the stuffing. It was perfectly seasoned. I'm not a huge fan of cranberry - but I LOVED it in this sandwich. The crunchy, yet soft bread, delicious turkey, perfectly seasoned stuffing, with a little salty, and little sweet from the cranberry - oh, I just.... I think I want another one. NO - I KNOW I want another one!

I thought the staff here was nice too, and even though it was busy when I walked in I felt as though they were handling it well. I'm pretty sure they get a lot of business with their location being so close to the strip and the employees exemplify the fact that they're used to this kind of bustle of people.

Will I be back? Yes, absolutely."}
{"text":"The worst meatball sub! Ordered meatball sub, waited, waited, then finally I was given my sub! I unwrapped it and sat down to eat, and I bit into it and it was mushy and hardly warm, cheese was not even melted! Brought it back to the counter and told the guy that sandwich was barely warm! The guy said oh! Gosh someone turned off the kettle where the meatballs are kept! \"Seriously\"! He said \" let me throw it on the grill and heat it up for you\" whatever meat was previously cooked or \"heated\" on that grill was absorbed by my meatball sandwich, because now the meatballs have a funky very salty taste!!!  After a second try I just decided to leave very disappointed, and never to return. I don't believe they seemed to be concerned with a dissatisfied customer ."}
{"text":"I was in town for work and had just stuffed myself on items I used to eat all the time that I cannot get in my current city (truth: the reason I rented that car was so I didn't have to eat at the conference hotel). I was super full. Arizona did not have Cap's when I lived here, so I wasn't expecting to see one as I stopped into Walmart for some items I'd forgotten to pack. I think I yelled out loud, so excited to be able to get a Bobbie on this trip!  My full stomach did not deter me, I was now on a mission. 

I walk in, it's empty, and the teenage dude behind the counter looked way less than thrilled to be working (I get it, nobody is stoked to be at work, but fake it 'till you make it). 

Me: Large bobbie, please.
Dude: Uh, you know that's like, 20 inches right?
Me: Yup. I am aware. 
Dude: Uh...... ok.

Usually the service at Caps is a bit better, but no matter, I was after a giant Thanksgiving sandwich, and that is what I got.  That sandwich didn't make it out of the parking lot before I started on it, and I happily munched on it through the duration of the trip.  No shame when it comes to food not available to me at home!"}
{"text":"There's not much that I can say that hasn't already been said.  Cap's serves a mean sandwich.  No, they serve an amazing sandwich. I can have it for every meal when I'm in town.  I've only tried one variety though, because it was so fantastic, I've never felt the need to try anything else! I tried Caps' for the first time at a Yelp Elite event, and  made my friends take me there immediately for a full-size sandwich experience.  I didn't realize it was a chain until much later, as they don't have Cap's where I live, so sad. 

My one true sandwich love: The Bobbie.  Turkey, cranberries, and stuffing.  I've tried to replicate it at home, and I can't even come close They must sprinkle it with magic.  It's not the cheapest sandwich in town, but you get what you pay for.  I need to try other sandwiches to see if they're just as fab, and if so, they definitely deserve a 5-star rating. 

This location is one of my favorites - it's  fast and friendly, with plenty of room to sit and enjoy your sandwich.  They also give military discounts, and if you check in on Yelp, they usually have a check-in offer (not all locations do)."}
{"text":"I love Cap's.  I've stated that in previous reviews.  I would eat a Bobbie sandwich everyday if I could (but I can't, because I don't live anywhere near one!).   Their food is seriously awesome, and you need to take my word for it and go see for yourself.

This location is pretty small, and doesn't have much seating.  It's definitely a grab-and-go kind of situation.  Last time I was there, they didn't have Yelp check-in offer, where other locations did.  Bummer!  

The location itself gets 3 stars, but Cap's can't just be A-OK,, simply because the Bobbie is so wonderful!"}
{"text":"Always great food here!! The philly is phenomenal! But, my all time favorite is the Capastrami! Sometimes it's a bit of a wait, but, I don't mind because they take the time to make sure your sandwich is consistently good, every time. Their soups are also fresh & hearty. Keep up the great job !"}
{"text":"I grew up in New York and Philadelphia. This place place has some of the best subs I've had. Not just in AZ but anywhere. Everyone who works at the Scottsdale location is very courteous and love going here. 5 star shop!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best sandwich shop ever!  The real pulled turkey is key.  This not \"lunchmeat\" turkey, it is the shredded, pulled thanksgiving kind!  The Cole Turkey is my favorite and my family loves the Bobbie, thanksgiving in a bun!  I am so happy there is a location in Wisconsin!  We frequent here at least once a month driving from Beloit, WI."}
{"text":"Always good stuff!  I love seeing something from Delaware when I travel!"}
{"text":"I would have loved to go there, but the smoking in the place was too much, we didn't even walk through the door.  We hunted down another capriottis near where we were staying.  Such a shame!"}
{"text":"Went in to order and no one in line before us. There are two people working (one for register and the other for sandwiches) while the manager is in her office. 6 more people walk in with multiple orders. It then took 30 minutes to make our sandwiches! The manager did not jump in to help at all. 5/28/18"}
{"text":"Cashier was very helpful and the 2 young ladies was very patience with my order.(Only bad turn off....there's a fly there that won't stop bugging around)!!"}
{"text":"This store is run like a CHARM. I've dreamed for years of the perfect turkey and stuffing sammie, and I could not ask for ANYTHING more than having it served up by such amazing people. Everyone who works here really understands how a business should be run. From the friendly smiles and playful attitudes - this place just has great vibes. Don't forget to leave these guys some BEEEEER money! haa! Oh yes!"}
{"text":"The Philly cheese steak was probably one of the best I have had in a long time. If you happen to be in old town and are looking for a good lunch, this is the spot"}
{"text":"Just wow. Called to place an order a few mins ago and was placed on hold then I heard her complaining, then the phone went blank..called again few min later and she said call back in 5 min it's busy. I said uhh ok. She said ok bye. #1 learn to put you phone on hold especially if you're gonna complain #2 I get your busy but the smart way to do it was to take my order since it was a phone order and you would've had time to make it. No wonder you have bad reviews and low ratings."}
{"text":"Capriotti's seriously has THE BEST sandwiches I have ever tasted! I always switch off between \"The Bobbie\" and the \"Cole Turkey.\" Both are fantastic! This particular location loads on the ingredients too, so I never feel like I'm getting jipped. The ingredients are always fresh and the sandwiches are huge! Their smalls are about the same size as a large at most sandwich chains. They also use shredded turkey instead of sliced which seemed odd to me at first, but it actually tastes very good!"}
{"text":"This location is horrible! A bunch of young inexperienced staff. I ordered a chicken cheese steak with extra pepper mix. When I opened my sandwich up the entire top layers was pepper mix. And peppers on the bottom. Totally overkill! The sandwich was too hot to enjoy."}
{"text":"Perhaps because they advertise themselves with a banner saying \"Greatest Sandwich in America,\" I had pretty high expectations for their subs! The service was decent and the inside is large, but ultimately the food was lacking. 

I ordered the \"Bobbie\" since that's what they're known for, and it was unbelievably dry (and cold? It felt like it was taken straight out of the fridge). We also ordered two other sandwiches, the cheese steak and the meatball sub. Both were decent (and better than the Bobbie for sure), but still comparable to Subway. 

Still, I give this sandwich shop some kudos because it seems like a favorite among locals, and perhaps the \"Bobbie\" is just a polarizing choice - some people love it, some people hate it. I can see why Capriotti's would be a great place to eat after a long day (carbs make everything better), but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there and it's certainly not Scottsdale's best."}
{"text":"good food but pricey sandwiches. Ordered the large Philly Cheese steak, asked me what i wanted on the sandwich, i asked what comes on it, evidently only meat and cheese. I told them everything, which includes mushrooms, onions and peppers. After getting the bill the mushrooms were a $1 extra which was never said, the sandwich ended up being almost $15. I have had better subs for even less money. Would I go again? not likely. The search for better and less cost continues :)"}
{"text":"Ended up going to this place to eat while visiting Vegas. We had a busy day roaming around the strip and decided to head back to our hotel. Around dinner time we wanted to avoid the busy strip and grab something quick to eat. We ordered the capastrami and the chicken cheese steak sandwich. The pastrami was good but the chicken sandwich was a bit dry. Overall though not too shabby."}
{"text":"This is place is  right off the freeway on Craig attached to Sinclair gas station. It's such a convenience esp bc it's 24 hours!!!!! It's always clean, the staff is always nice!! I always order the Bobbi but  my husband decided to get the chicken cheesesteak which was a great choice!!  The chicken was moist, smothered in melted cheese, mushrooms with peppers!! After having this sub I will prob never have a cheesesteak again!! It's was sooo good!!  
ATTENTION!!
My updated  review is that this place has one down drastically since my last review!!"}
{"text":"Ate at capriotti's yesterday and I've been craving deli sandwiches since.  The bread soaks up the meat juices and that's what made capriotti's stand out to me.  No dry subway bread here! 

Tasted their italian sub, chicken cheesesteak and capastrami (had to try it!) 

I can't say the capastrami beats \"the Hat\" out here in california but I would eat here again (probably to grab sandwiches for the car drive back). 

Oooh, make sure to grab extra napkins too - these sandwiches are drippy!!!"}
{"text":"As with all Capriottis, the sandwiches are excellent. This particular location has problems keeping its tables clean. I've been here at least 20 times and only once have I found a clean table. Other than that the service is speedy and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"We had about 3 different sandwiches... from what i remember they were all pretty good! Pretty cheap and a sandwich can feed like 5! I think my favorite was the Bobbie, it had like cranberry sauce of some sort. The Capastrami sandwich, and cole turkey was also pretty delicious."}
{"text":"Get the Capastrami. Make sure you get a big one, or else you'll be regret it when you're wanting more later. ;)"}
{"text":"This location is TERRIBLE, they always get my order wrong. When I email corporate after about 8 emails they finally get back and tell me they never received other emails. They send me coupons and then they won't honor them when I get over there"}
{"text":"Came here based on yelp recommendations.  It isn't on the strip but just off it, not a problem since we had a car.

I believe this place is a chain, not only once place.  There is a whole list of  sandwiches you can choose from.

We got the capitrami, cheese steak, tuna, bobbie.  They were all decent sandwiches, not your standard type. 
Service was kind of slow, but the sandwiches were good.  Really great drunk food after a long night of drinking a well.

Not sure I'll make the trek out there again for sandwiches, but I'll definitely keep them in mind."}
{"text":"I know I'm going to get crap for this but, oh well here goes...
Starving, I go out into the vicious sauna that is Scottsdale in monsoon season, seeking food on a Sunday afternoon. After a couple of \"closed on Sunday\" disappointments, I decided to go slumming at the always-disappointing Schlotskys Deli on Scottsdale. Lo and behold, shiny new Capriottis and Everything Bagel swooped in to save the neighborhood.  Yay... No wait, hold my calls, I'm not done. I walk in and the place is about 85* in the restaurant... Yuck. I walk up to the register to order and asked the very pregnant sweating girl how long ago did they take over Schlotskys.  She rolled her eyes, looked down, and said \"2 months, what would you like to order?\"  I ordered. Then she asked for my name to tag my order.  I told her my name.  Another giant eye roll and a (fuck it, who cares) shrug. She says \"I can't spell\".  Because I don't normally care whether my name is spelled or pronounced correctly, even though, on this very rare occasion, I had pronounced it phonetically for her, I just blew it off. But then, right on the cash register screen facing me, was her spelling... \"corney\".  I laughed. She scoffed... \"What?\" She says. \"I'm just laughing at how you spelled my name.\" Then she smirks and says \"it works.\" And walked away without even looking at me. OK, kinda snotty.
I walk down to where the food comes out, and the young dude making my sandwich is also sweating (no kidding)  and wiping the sweat off with the back of his wrist.  Whatever... it's Scottsdale.
The other kid working was on his lunch break. I could tell that by how he blew past me full speed, across the store, clumsily juggling a plastic cup and skidded 3 feet to a stop in front of an available table to eat at, and plopped his ass down. I hope he chose something caffeine free. 
Look, I know they're young, I know it's hot here, I know other guy is a spaz, I know she's pregnant, I can even surmise that she may not like her job, life, self... None of those things negate the fact that you (said employees) went out and got yourself a job in the food service industry... Serving others, food. Part of service is being polite. Another part is being professional. Where the f are the adults to corral these youngsters and teach them how to represent your business? Shame on you. 
Oh, the sandwich was fantastic! Thank you, sweaty tall kid."}
{"text":"Having just sampled Capriotti's again, this time at Night of the Living Neon, where they were very generous sponsors, I took my break from the slots at Red Rock for my Wednesday night Food Court Feast.  :)   Their Bobby was calling to me, but I decided to lower the carb quotient by going for their Cole Turkey sandwich.  I guess I didn't realize that, unlike all the other sub joints, Capriotti's uses REAL, FRESH turkey!!, and that helps explain why their prices are a bit higher than the competition.  

The sandwich was super.  I asked for the Russian dressing on the side, and I was given a container big enough to dress my next four salads.  The turkey was moist, the provolone really good, and the cole slaw just the way I like it.  My only complaint is that their Small sandwich, at 9\", is just too big for me.  I'd love to see a smaller one at a smaller price, but I bet not too many people would share this nit.  

I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"all i have to say is there sandwiches are the best in town.i live like a block from the Green valley ranch casino so its great i can just pop in and get a Sandwich on my way home. also they have fries at the gvr location .i heard that all locals don't offer fries. i suggest if you go and you haven't been before that you get \" the Bobbie\" its like thanksgiving on a roll. turkey stuffing cranberry sauce. amazing. i also dig the \"slaw b Jo\" i find that there sandwiches are filling ,creative, and down right unmissable."}
{"text":"Great place for a mushroom cheesesteak. The bread always seems to dry and chewie to me. 10-15 minute waits are normal if you dont call ahead."}
{"text":"Not on the main drag but certainly worth it. Helpful & pleasant server clued us in to the best menu choices. On G maps it looked close to Circus Circus but not really. Great deli sandwiches without the 'on strip' prices"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Capriotti's but I picked this location because i was in the area.  Everything was great with placing my order and pick up but when I got home and opened my sandwich, I was highly disappointed. I realized it was close to closing when I place the order but if you didn't have enough meat to make the sandwich I would have rather you not made it. Subway would have made a better sandwich  than what I received from Capriotti's today."}
{"text":"This location is so close to my house we usually come here every weekend. The service has always been eh but today I was blown away. They close at 7, I came in at 6:45 with one other person with me wanting to get my usual cheesesteak. The lady at the counter said they couldn't make hot sandwiches as they'd already shut off the equipment. Seriously? As someone who has been a general manager at a fast food restaurant that is one of the worst things my employees could do. If I ever found out they shut off equipment before closing so they could leave early they would be fired. Definitely won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches here! 

They always make my order exactly how I want it! 

However, I never eat inside the restaurant. The inside isn't very nice looking nor are the seats comfortable. If you're getting something to eat, get it to go.

Last time I was there it took about 20 minutes to make my sandwhich. There was no one there besides me. They had someone being trained at the time and he was preparing my sandwhich. I informed them that I was in a rush (flight to catch) and they apologized but kept the same, slow pace.

Very frustrating. 

Good food, so-so experience."}
{"text":"I traveled from AZ to NY and on my way there I wanted to stopped by but they were closed. So when I got back from NY tonight the first thing I wanted was a Bobbie. I walked in and was told they were closed, i must have made a face bc the girl working asked me what was wrong. I explained to her how I had traveled 2000 miles for a Bobbie. Melissa stayed open a little bit longer to make me one and she was so sweet. Excellent customer service experience and the sandwich was made perfectly, most people would throw it together, you could tell her and her coworker actually cared that I had a good experience. I wish more people were like that. Just another reason why I love Capriottis."}
{"text":"The Bobby is a great year round sandwich but, the Cap salad is to be avoided.  The salad had more yellow than green and was on the pulled side instead of chopped.  So, bypass that salad until improvements happen. Yuck on the salad."}
{"text":"I work close by and tend to order from here about once a month. Yesterday I had the best service I've ever experienced in Vegas. I ordered online and 15 minutes later when i walked in the door the amazing friendly gentleman behind the counter remembered what I ordered and had it ready when i walked up. I also love that I asked for customization online and my sandwich was perfect!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Bobbie and was not disappointed! Turkey, cranberry, stuffing and mayo! Outstanding food and service! I will be back and suggest this eatery! Thank you"}
{"text":"Woah nelly. Bobbie is a wanted sandwich. Yeehaw! Get this varmit, er sub. It's a new thing for me, eating thanksgiving in August in sub form. Cranberry jelly with stuffing and a few layers of turkey makes this a must have while puttin' around in Vegas. 

As far as I know there are no Capriotti's in Los Angeles so I won't be able to celebrate thanksgiving any time I want. Sad. 

Staff are always cool. It's a requirement there.

I once had another sandwich not called the Bobbie. It was pastrami and cole slaw. B+"}
{"text":"The Bobbie. It's good. It's different. It's thanksgiving in a sandwich. Cranberry, mayo and turkey never tasted so good on a roll. It's one of those perfect meals on the way back to LA. 

There's nothing else to say. I'm sure they have excellent sandwiches. I've even tried one before but the fact remains. Nobody is doing too much for thanksgiving in a sandwich these days. For those in Los Angeles there are a few locations to check out."}
{"text":"You can't have a bad sub here they have everything to make you what you want I think this place has the best phillies in town"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with our visit. We live nearby and visit quite often but today sandwich was awful and the girl who took our order didn't even make us feel welcome and she didn't even say thank you for our tip when we paid. Cmon, people tip out of appreciation and to hear BEER MONEY."}
{"text":"Good food and customer service. We ordered mushroom cheese steak subs and they were delicious. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This location has the best employees by far! Most nights I have an order between 4-12 subs for my company, and it's always done in a prompt fashion. I sometimes use different locations because of the hours, and I always regret it. I just wish the one on Stephanie was 24 hours! 

Thanks guys"}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying I love Capriotti's! I spend roughly between 1k-2k a month at the one on Stephanie for my business. Every once in a while I'll stop at the one in Boulder City for personal use. Like most Capriotti's the food is great, but I have encountered many problems with the service at this location. The employees are always miserable, and what I think is the owner, rubs me the wrong way. I'll come in and order one thing it will take 30 mins, and people that order after me get served first. And when I politely ask when my sub will be ready the owner/manger tells me I should have ordered online. Lesson learned, next time I ordered online as I was at a gas station about to pass through BC. I showed up 10 minutes after I order and walked in a said I had a pick up, she immediately said that they just received that order and I needed to wait, in a very passive aggressive way. I was expecting to wait longer, but she made me feel like I inconvenienced her by spending money at her establishment. I have had another handful of problems here, so in conclusion, if you are wanting to eat at Capriotti's, and about to drive to Henderson, wait to you get to the Stephanie and 215 location. I couldn't say more good things about that one, the young kids that work there are awesome and friendly. My only concern is that they are so good that they will be leaving for bigger and better things."}
{"text":"I LOVE the chicken cheese steak with hot and sweet peppers!!!!! So spicy and delicious!
This was my first time at this location, it was just as good as the location by my house.
This is my standard go to sandwich. It is always great, ALWAYS!!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop around, all of their sandwiches are good, my favorite from here is the Capastromi. I hate coleslaw, but in this sandwich they have pastrami, lots of pastrami and coleslaw, what a combination yo, if you go, get that, you will dig."}
{"text":"Chicken cheese steak w/hot and sweet peppers!!!! Yum! This is my absolute favorite sandwich. If you haven't tried this one....... you are missing out!
Bread is super fresh and they use REAL pulled chicken, not cold cuts!

I know one of their most popular sandwiches is the bobbie, I am not a fan of that particular combination of ingredients on a sandwich, but the fact they use real turkey......seriously..... REAL turkey!
 I can no longer eat at the other cold cut sandwich places. That processed meat is just not appetizing at all.

At this particular location I like to call my order in ahead. They are super busy and sandwiches made fresh so the wait can be a little bit sometimes.
(but so worth it)"}
{"text":"Open sign on means open.  11 hr work day. I roll in famished.  15 mins before 8.  Ya my bad?  Open means open.   They start giving me guilt trip eyes.  Then everything i order there out of.   Sure.   Next time turn the sign off.  Btw. I tip super fat.    I drove to pops.   And it ruled."}
{"text":"Sandwich sizes were HUGE.  The place wasn't the cleanest and had NO SEATING or apparent bathrooms.  Yes, the Bobby tastes like thanksgiving, but a mess of a half-hearted thanksgiving it was.  I'll wait until November next time, thank you.  The Italian sandwich my wife had was nice.  Bread was hardly better than Subway.  An alright place to eat if you are hungry but I won't be going out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"Food is great. Customer service sucks. But it's close to home so I don't have much of a choice. Ignore the kid with the 'man bun' and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"Not normally a fan of sandwich shops but I can't help myself from stopping here when I drive by.  I guess I'm an addict for the Bobbie sandwich.  All of the best from Thanksgiving, turkey, cranberry sauce, and dressing in a bun.  I hear the other sandwiches are great also.  

I can't even think about going to Subway after eating here.  Capriotti's is to Subway like In-N-Out is to McDonalds.  

I know that In-N-Out Burger is on the to do list for many tourists.  If they only knew about Capriotti's!  If you are staying at the Hard Rock there is no excuse to make a trip across the street."}
{"text":"Ate here twice and love the place! The capistrami is the bomb! Huge portion goodness. Great value. Don't really care much of Bobbie though."}
{"text":"I have always loved Capriotti's and found they have the best philly cheese steaks in Vegas (and beyond). 

However, I decided to try the Tuna Sub yesterday and all I can say is WOW. Best Tuna Sub ever.  I never thought I would have to leave a great review for something as simple as a tuna sandwich, but after eating that one, I had to tell the world - lol.

So, I will continue to spread the good word about the great food at Capriottis and continue enjoying the best sandwiches in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hit the Red Rock food court for a late night munchie fest after the Rock N Roll wine event and had to have a philly cheese steak.

Capriotti's has THE best Philly cheese steaks in all of Vegas!

Oh yea!"}
{"text":"No smile, very dirty store, dirty employees, my sandwiches took 20 mins (2 of them) , brown lettuce, no \"hello, thank you,\" or even a damn acknowledgment. I love Capriottis but this store puts the name to shame. I even tipped them and I actually regret it."}
{"text":"Nice little sandwich shop near my gym. They do have vegetarian sandwiches, and burgers. I cut out cheese from my healthy eating habit, so my sandwich was a little boring. I wish they'd add some sauce or other spread for the burgers or subs. Maybe some southwest sauce? Still a great value, and the sandwiches taste great."}
{"text":"Get The Bobby. The other sandwiches are good, but who doesn't love Thanksgiving on a bun? Nom nom nom. I have never called ahead so I can't tell you what that's like. They make it as you order it (kind of like JJs) so it really doesn't take that long to wait. Their chips are super weird. Some kind of Owl brand I have never heard of. They are gross too. Don't get the chips. Get The Bobby."}
{"text":"MMMmmmmm....Nostalgia.  I lived in Delaware for basically too long and sandwiches from Capriottis were one of the few bright spots.  

This shop near UNLV was a bit off the beaten path, but it had the sandwich I wanted:  the Bobbie.   Sooooooooo good!   The bread was the same, and the proportions were perfect.  Even splitting a medium is a serious meal.

Weird thing was that they had only one flavor of drink (Sprite) and limited chip options.  This happened during the school year (March), when you'd think they'd be replenishing stuff once or twice a day. 

Tables outside were a plus; might move inside in the summer."}
{"text":"I've been to many Capriotti's establishments before; this establishment has got to be the worse one... Why you ask? It's so dirty, I was looking around and looked at the floor, and I made the mistake to not go somewhere else. The sandwich was okay, like at any other location, but I asked to eat there and my sandwich was served on a dirty plate. I'll definitely go to other locations."}
{"text":"I never had any problems at other Capriotti's locations, even this one. Until now. 
I ordered a meatball sub.  When I got it the sandwich the bread and the provolone cheese was ICE COLD which made the meatballs luke warm. I had an appointment and was running late so I just ate the meatballs and through the rest away. Not only did the sandwich taste bad but hot food has to be served at least at 160 degrees and this wasn't near that temperature. I was going to complain on the way out, but all the employees were playing in the back. They looked like they all had a bong of weed or two. I hope I don't get sick from this!"}
{"text":"Sandwich spot is on point! Ham was delicious! Open 24 hours, def good for a late night snack! Ham & the capricola along w/ the grilled onions compliment each other really well. Philly cheese steak was also very delicious. A must if your craving something delish late night!"}
{"text":"First time I have been in this place and it will not be the last. The young lady at the register was very friendly and the service was excellent!  The food was awesome and it was delivered to me very fast. Thank you for making my experience here pleasurable. I Will be back when I am on this side of town again! Thank you again young lady!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service!!! I called in a phone order while grocery shopping at the Smiths across the street. Went inside to the counter and paid (I even gave them a tip) only to wait for 20 minutes while walk in orders were made first!!! I went back up to counter to ask the status and was told it coming right up only to wait another 10 minutes. I love Capriotti's but I will definitely be staying away from this location."}
{"text":"On Sundays \"Great Boa\" is not open (missed that memo), so I was left trying to find a quick lunch before heading to the airport.  Luckily Capriotti's was nearby and completely empty.  It was like 1pm and I ordered a 12\" Capistrami with no cheese.  Delicious!  The pastrami was tasty but not overwhelmingly salty.  The slaw, and I'm not usually a fan of slaw, was light and sweet and crispy.  And the Russian dressing was not overbearing but made the whole thing creamy and juicy.  But the best part of the sandwich is the bread.  I really liked the spongy soft roll - it's not like a typical flaky roll that breaks apart when you bite in.  I'm happy to report my sandwich stayed together until every bit of it was in my belly.  Oh, and half of the sandwich filled me up great, and I ate the other half at the airport hours later.  Not a bad way to spend $9.50 at all!"}
{"text":"I remember one time online I saw an article naming the best sandwiches of each state. When I looked at Nevada, they named Capriotti's Bobbie, which is the cold turkey, with stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo. Ever since then, I have always wanted to try this shop. 
Well, I finally did at the urging of my friend who used to work at one. 

I ordered the Bobbie, and got the Pastramiatti for my friend. He explained to me that they cook the turkeys at night and pull all the fresh turkey off daily. He also said the same for the roast beef, so that one I will try next time.  I did take a bite of his Pastrami and it was really good too!

I loved my sandwich. There was plenty of turkey, and dressing (that's what we call it in the south), but since I am not a sweets eater, I would ask for \"light on the cranberry\" next time I get this sandwich. It was topped with the creamy mayo and pepper, making the combo great. Also, the bread was delicious!  Just the right amount of chewy, soft texture a French type roll should have. 

The staff were amazingly friendly and loved to tell me all about the sandwiches when I told them it was my first time. 
What a great place...why did I wait so long to try this???"}
{"text":"Ok so this is my first time ordering from Capriotti's so I decided to try their signature sandwich, \"The Bobbie\" and mmm let's just say it's not for me! Texturally it was not very good , soft stuffing , cranberry sauce and , shredded turkey! Unfortunately for me lol because the 12\" was huge and I wish I could if eaten up! My husband had the cheese steak with sweet peppers & it was so good! Tender thin sliced meat , melted cheese, soft bread! A1!  

 The delivery was fast and it was correct! I will definitely try again and order something different"}
{"text":"Got food here at least six times and half of the time they got the order wrong. I like the sandwiches, but I'm getting tired of the lack of attention this location places on the orders. They always leave off ingredients and sometimes those ingredients cost extra which is beyond frustrating, because it's pricey enough as it is for a sandwich."}
{"text":"The restaurants at the Red Rocks food court offer vegetarian options, but Capriotti's is the only place that offers four mock meats (turkey, steak, salami and burger). I did a doubletake at the menu on the wall, because although they had a vegetarian section, I thought it was a mistake. Looking closely I saw the \"Vegetarian Meats are 100% Meatless.\" Bingo!!

I initially ordered the Cheese Steak (which I was really looking forward to) - but was told that it was still frozen and not ready (I got there at 11am). So I opted for the Turkey sandwich. Mmmmmm! The mock turkey portions were generous on a sub roll, with lettuce, tomato, lettuce and italian seasonings. It reminded me of the days of growing up in New Jersey and eating hoagies from Wawa. I would give them five stars if they had vegan mayonnaise (like the excellent Wildwood Garlic Aioli).

I hope I get a chance to try their vegetarian cheese steak (btw, if you're ever in San Francisco, check out Jay's Cheesesteaks for their seitan offerings)."}
{"text":"This location is a busy one and they handle it pretty dang well! I try to remember and order my food online so my sandwiches are ready and waiting for me upon arrival, the app is suuuuper easy!

My go to sammys include-

Chicken Cheesesteak- holy fricken moly! I'm a philly girl for life and have always chosen beef, but wow, their chicken version outweighs the beef x10! I add peppers, shrooms, lettuce, and tomato to complete my version of a perfect sandwich! 

Rueben- their version is delish the cole slaw is always crunchy and their russian dressing is nice and tangy. 

The Bobby!!!- I prefer hot sandwiches(my mom asks for hers heated up!), but, even though it's cold The Bobby is pretty awesome. Thanksgiving leftovers are my fave and throwing them all on a sandwich is what I crave every year. Capriotti's gets me by...

I have yet to have a complaint about the service and food at this restaurant, they rock. Only downfall is the crappy parking lot they share with a bunch of businesses, parking sucks."}
{"text":"Sadly I was in Vegas for business not pleasure. No fun for Joshie boy. Alas I was hungry and amazingly was not feeling burger. GPS brought me here and while this place is a chain they are putting out sandwiches they can be proud of. After viewing the menu board it read that the \"Bobbie\" is their signature. Nuff read that is what I ordered. Ordered the small (\"9 sub on a Kaiser roll) and it was loaded with turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing. It had light mayo. For the first time in my life I thought this sandwich could use a little more mayo but other than that it was hearty, well made and had a wonderful flavor combination."}
{"text":"I normally rate Capriottis with 4 stars, but this location gets a slight deduction for the following reasons:

1) tiny seating area (had to get mine to go). Not really their fault, but forgivable.

2) no restroom. How do they expect me to wash my hands before I eat? Again, not their fault, but this is a biggie for me. I had to go use the bathroom at the neighboring Krispy Kreme where I also caved into temptation.


Sandwich was delicious (as expected)"}
{"text":"Great place to go if you like being insulted by the cashiers. I went and picked up an online order. Cashier implied I stole the credit card I used to pay for the order."}
{"text":"super amazing! this location has great service and jaydon who served us did a great job! thanks :) ill be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"I like this location because its convenient to where I live and the people are nice but they just don't listen when you ask for something.

Three times now I have passed through and asked them to cut my sandwich in half and wrap separately only to find out the did cut it in half but did not wrap it separately???

What is REALLY frustrating is they look you in the face and say sure no problem and still don't do it.

Can't see providing a tip anymore when going in here and paying if I go back to this location as I don't get the service I ask for."}
{"text":"Ordered food for pickup. Had 4 sandwiches and 2 salads.  

One was a kids meal in which they left the drink and chips out of the order.  We also ordered extra hot peppers which we were charged for and they left that out.

When you don't live right next door to a place it would be nice if they can get your order correct....it's not rocket science....how hard if you wrote everything down is it double check an order before you give it out.  Also double Che king man order with get good reviews and repeat customers.

I guess this place does not desire repeat customers.  Also when someone calls to let you know they got their order wrong, tell the girl to not be so rude, because that effects your business as well..."}
{"text":"If you have their application you can go online and look at the menu and actually place your order.  The time given on the application for the food to be ready was spot on.  I arrived early but they were working on my sandwich when I got there and everyone in the place was really nice.  The best person there though was the guy making my sandwich.  Even though they were all really nice the guy making my sandwich seemed to be the only one focused on this visit.  I heard him ask several times for replenishment of items at the station but everyone seemed to be to busy chatting with each other and you could tell he was getting frustrated because he was not getting any support from his fellow employees.

Things happen in the workplace and people have the right to have fun and enjoy their job however when customers are in the store, there should be a level of professionalism exhibited which is what the customers observe, not one person working and everyone else playing and not supporting him.  That was kind of embarrassing and he did apologize to me several times for what was happening in the place.

This is a place I will return to as I like the food, they have always been consistent on the quality and quantity."}
{"text":"I've used Cap's as a go-to place for sandwiches for many years.  I just got a tuna sub and am throwing most of it out.  The truly excessive amount of salt in the tuna fish salad is nasty.  It was a serious mistake to order the tuna sub.  It would have been cheaper to just dump a shaker of salt directly into my mouth."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few different times and every time no always get a Capistrami. I'm always pleased with the service and the way my food comes out. Place is nice and they get extra stars from me because they're open 24/7!! Perfect for me because sometimes I get in pretty late and get really hungry. Definitely a must visit!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to try it out after driving by for weeks. They claim that it was voted the best sandwich in America. We don't know who voted but we suspected it was the staff because I can't imagine that anyone who had been to Chicago or New York or even to Quizno's would say that. We had the Bobbie and the Capastrami at the suggestion of the girl at the register. She said they were their most popular. Neither were what we would call a great sandwich much less the best. Both sandwiches relied too much mayonnaise to give them some semblance of flavor. The Bobbie was basically Thanksgiving leftovers on a bun and not that great a bun. The cranberry sauce tasted like it was canned. The stuffing couldn't even compete with Stauffer's. It was boring. The Capastrami was a bit better but only a bit. It would have been better if they had better bread. The swiss cheese wasn't strong like a good swiss but tasted like the presliced cheese in the packages hanging on the rack in the grocery store. The pastrami was mild, once again no better than what you'd get at the grocery store. The cole slaw was unremarkable and again - too much mayo. With outstanding sandwiches like those from Bertha's Cafe and Cheese 'N Stuff in Central Phoenix, don't waste your time or money on this place."}
{"text":"Horrible roast beef sub................They used dry shredded beef. Ugh!"}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's and I love that they are at the courthouse. Even though you're at the courthouse you still get the same great service and the same great food."}
{"text":"I love their cheesesteaks. Last time I was in I ordered 2 large cheesesteaks with fried onions & hot peppers on the side. They gave me a tiny container of hot peppers. When I asked for more I was given such an attitude.  She told me \"I'll have to charge you for more.\" I was stunned. Never before was I told that plus I'm paying for 2 big cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"Speaking of sandwiches, one of the best sandwiches I've ever had was at Capriotti's last year in Vegas.  It's an interesting establishment; It originated in Delaware but now Nevada has by far the most locations.

Not sure if this was the one I went to, but I'm guessing the other locations are comparable.  It was kind of out of the way, away from the strip.  We took a cab there and didn't realize there was no ride back.  We ended up walking under the tremendous heat afterward but eventually found a taxi after walking several blocks.  Oh well, we had to try it because of the good things said about the place.

So we decided to share one of those super long subs.  We got the Capastrami because pastrami is the best meat on a sandwich (imo).  And....wow.  It was amazing.  The pastrami, coleslaw, and russian dressing of some sort made this sandwich so unique and so darn tasty.  It was just pure bliss.

I have to go back, but alas there isn't a Capriotti's remotely closeby.  Anyone up for a road trip to Vegas?  Or Ahwatukee, Arizona perhaps?"}
{"text":"Unless you want to order directly off their menu, don't bother. Any special orders are just too difficult."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is ALWAYS so slow. Omg. I don't understand why other sandwich shops can get it right and make sandwiches in a timely manner but capriotti's cant.  They either don't have enough staff and/or the staff take their sweet time. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I am sure this place will get FIVE STARS next time. I have only had one sandwich from here so far. However, I had it twice already. The Capastrami. OMG...YUMMY!!!
Going to try other items soon and will have to add more to my comments."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches and best customer service that I've experienced since I moved here to Las Vegas. I go here so much that they know me by name already. 

My favorite is the Bobbie. Just tried the Slaw Be Jo and it was great too. 

I recommend that everybody tries this place at least once."}
{"text":"Where everything on the strip and at the convention is overpriced, thank Capriotti's for some quick, tasty great-value sandwiches!

A small is 9-inches around $6 and a medium is 12-inches around $8.  $13 gets you a 20-inch sandwich (large), be it hot or cold or special.

We got the 20-inch Cheese Steak to share.  Their pastrami sandwiches seem to be popular, but it's hard to beat Langer's in LA.

Capriotti's is coming to Beverly Hills on Wilshire.  I'm never in BH for lunch, so I'm glad I got a taste of this chain out here."}
{"text":"Same great sandwiches, but the prices are slightly higher at this location."}
{"text":"Great food great prices great service. Can't get better than that. Philly sandwich is awesome. my credit card was having issues and the center people were very patient while I got it resolved I will go here again."}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars, I would.  My co-worker and I went to grab some lunch to go back to our office across the street. The woman behind the counter, Lisa, was one of the RUDEST employees we have ever encountered at a restaurant in awhile. I felt super RUSHED as I ordered.  I ordered the chicken cheese steak and before I could even finish what I was ordering, she said \"with everything on it?\" and basically cut me off.  She did the same thing to my friend.  She never gave me the cup for my fountain drink (which 3 drinks were out of order anyways), so I grabbed a bottle drink from the refrigerator (after making sure they were the same price). 

While we were waiting for our sandwiches, a gentleman in a wifebeater tank top came in.  Lisa immediately greeted him, told him since it was hot outside she was going to buy him a drink, flirted with him and also told him she would make his sandwich first.  I know that he ordered a cold sandwich, but his order came out WAY before ours did.

Lisa did say \"Thank you\", after we said \"thank you\" to her when she handed us our sandwiches.  My co-worker and I made sure to tell everyone about our horrible experience in our office.  We will not support such RUDE customer service.

I will visit other locations but not this one!"}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's but I wasn't in love with the service at this location. They weren't super rude; they just seemed...uninterested, almost slightly annoyed that we were ordering. We ordered and then walked to another store and when we came back the cook told us they didn't have enough of the ingredient needed to make the sandwich we ordered. Totally cool, shit happens, but I wish they would've said something when we ordered. Also, there is no soda machine, so be prepared to pay for a can of something. It wasn't terrible, I just wasn't blown away like I've come to expect from Capriotti's. I give them 3 brusque stars."}
{"text":"So the food here always tastes good enough but it is just how sloppily they throw it together. I should have taken a picture of the sandwich (the capastrami, normally my fave) that had ZERO meat on one half of it and it was so soggy and dripping with creamy slaw sauce it was almost inedible. I don't know if I pissed someone off who works there or something but I definitely felt the hate in that sandwich. Very unfortunate. I won't give up on capriottis altogether yet but today was a rough one to ignore."}
{"text":"OVER RATED!

Perhaps I'm a bit jaded being from NYC but seriously, the most average deli in New York is a little better than this joint. The bread here weak and let's face it, the bread is the foundation of a sandwich. The meats are fine (not great but acceptable). The selection is quite limited. And as for those specialty combination subs, umm, they border on gross. The Bobbie?! Why not just pour the contents of a garbage can onto some Wonderbread... same taste.

This place is a local favorite because you get a lot of bang for your buck. Fat boy paradise! But when it comes to quality they are average at best. I'll give it to them, they brought a mediocre east coast sub concept to a place where people don't know any better. 

If I were to recommend anything here it would be either the Cheese Steak or the Italian. Skip the meatballs. They are 80% bread. The roast beef is over cooked by 3 or 4 times, dry, flavorless. 

I give them 2 stars because the folks behind the counter are very nice. Yes, they are better than Subway."}
{"text":"I'm not one to complain but I couldn't believe the unprofessionalism & the rudeness of this branch. I was completely astounded the fact that I called to place an order for a party tray after being on hold for a few minutes. When the guy answered to take my order, I only asked him 2 questions about the party tray. I asked how big were the trays & how many people it served & the employee cut me off telling me that, \"can you call back in an hour from now? It's really busy & well yaa...\" I did let the cashier know how unprofessional & rude that was & all he did was say, \"Well yaa it's busy.\" Incredibly rude. I'm upset because I go to this Capriotti's quite often & the fact that they did this to me today, I will never have any interest in going back. As much as I'm extremely unhappy with their customer service today... all I can hope is that they never treat another customer like this again or in fact, perhaps stop continuing in treating their customers like this all the time."}
{"text":"It's been a a year and a half since I've been to Capriotti's. It used to be one of my favorite - albeit expensive - sandwich shops. I always get the Capistrami with extra cole slaw and today was no exception. But the changes weren't just with the food. The young man and young woman employees were ambivalent and a even a bit rude. It was 11am so well before the rush hour and there was only one other customer. The young man took my order with not even a smile, barely whispered the cost which I had to ask him to repeat, which he did with a roll of his eyes. He didn't hand me my receipt, just walked away. The young woman who cooked and made the sandwich was fast - and that's really the only good thing about my visit - it didn't take very long. She called out my order and when I picked it up I smiled and said thanks, and she looked back at me blankly. It was just weird, I don't understand how customer service businesses can survive with such a lack of basic courtesy. Oh well, as long as the food's great...right? Not! Now keep in mind, for a few years I've ordered the Capistrami almost every time (once in a while I'll get the Bobbi) so I know what it's supposed to look and taste like. But it seems like the \"family recipe\" that never changes...has changed...and not for the better. What little corned beef was on the sandwich was gristly and chewy. I asked for extra cole slaw as I always do, and she really put on extra cole slaw...but she put it in place of the normal amount of meat. There was a small pile in the middle of the bun, seriously with absolutely no meat at the ends. I had to open it, dig around and spread the small portion of corned beef around. So really, I had a cole slaw sandwich with a little corned beef. Definitely not worth $9. So very disappointed. Worst sandwich and service I've ever had at Capriotti's. And if this was my first time here, I would rank them below Subway. Next time I'll go back to WhichWich, they have virtually the same sandwich, for the same price, and it's 10 times better...oh, and the WhichWich employees are actually happy to see you and glad you came in."}
{"text":"Located on the same level as the Movie theaters.  I'm actually getting myself the black an bleu salad.  I get to try Jesse's sandwich that's why. Lol.

Small little shop, great service.  It's a small simple menu so that every time you go to Capriottis you can try each one.  I'm a Bobbie or Capastrami girl! Oh an hey have nothing Bundt cakes too. Yippie!"}
{"text":"Delicious sub!! I love how the turkey is shredded.  Tasty dressing on the sandwich gave it great flavor.  My only small comment is that the turkey ended up being a bit dry  because there was so much.  If the dressing had been on the meat, it would have been perfect.  WAY better than Subway :)"}
{"text":"Very fresh and very friendly staff. They are quick as well. Great lunch spot if you are pressed for time. I got the roast beef with slaw. 9 inches is the smallest option which was quite generous in itself. They also do 12 and 20 inches. Good luck trying to eat 20 inches. Lol."}
{"text":"HOLY SHIT! Literally the best sandwich shop I have ever ate at. Highly recommend the barbecue chicken. Fire fire fire"}
{"text":"I was told this was one of the best sandwich shops ever but my last experience was anything above average."}
{"text":"Cheesesteak was nothing special. Convenient location and fast service was a plus."}
{"text":"Was looking for a spot that wasn't on the Strip straws with tourists and not Asian food and my bestie who was also a local here recommended this spot. Honestly, I have never eaten a philly cheese as good as this place. And may I add, they don't give a wimpy sandwich. It's as long as my arm! I wish there was a location in Cali but it'll give me an excuse to visit Vegas again"}
{"text":"My 2nd time here. On occasion, I must have a steak & mushroom sub. This is a pretty tiny place & very welcoming. The young staff that works here MakeS this place,imo. They have a great attitude, sweet demeanor& greet u when u walk in. There are signs everywhere about this being \"The Best Of Vegas\" okayyy.. I got a straight steak& mushroom&sweet peppers. (easy order). I wasn't asked if I wanted anything extra on it..I didn't mind until I heard everyone else being asked, & then when mine came I had steak with no mushrooms, could barely see the peppers.(huhhhh?) I brought it back & asked for mushrooms.. I also asked for it toasted. They said it wasn't possible as bread would fall apart??..um,again, ok... There r several other sub places that preform this ,no problem, but I obliged & took my order. The entire time I was eating it, I was daydreaming about another sub place that is outstanding!!! Large,fresh bread, not soggy,  fresh meat grilled before your eyes, fresh veggies that u can watch them put on your order, so u know what u r getting. (((Efficiency, the first time, u can actually communicate with person making your food, bonus))))& I'm not talking subway. The subs are massive, the bread is crispy & made to order. Same price point.  It is also a bigger place with really nice staff as well. Let's just say, Jersey makes some kick.... subs & they do in Vegas as well & they're growing their business here. I give this place 3 stars because of the sweet staff. ,I believe they are working with what they have been given to work with.  It was a moment of convenience that I went here, but next time, I will go that lil extra to get the great sub I'm not going to feel guilty about eating those bread carbs. I believe the popularity of this place has much to do with its convenient location as well its name.. I think it would be nice, with this place having the \"success \"it does, that a lil inside overhaul & checking out your competition(JM's) wouldn't be a bad idea. The North end is being upgraded. It would be nice to have a great & updated subshop here as well."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad, not enough meat or sauce on top.  Plenty of lettuce, not enough toppings.  Also, if you are training someone you should not talk over the food you are making, unsanitary!  The Capriottis at the Courthouse is EXCELLENT!!!!!  Ordered a salad, and the salad was heavy!!!  Lots of meat, toppings, and sauce!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place doesn't have better reviews! The steak and cheese sandwich is out of this world!!!! It's the best steak and cheese I've had in a VERY long time and this is my favorite type of sandwich.  I live very close and am going to utilize their delivery service in the future.  The only thing I'd change is having a better selection of chips and drinks but that's nothing I'd deduct points for because they aren't the main attraction. Great service, great food, fair prices = 5 stars in my book."}
{"text":"I see lots go good reviews here.  If you like shredded cardboard your going to love this place!  
I strongly suggest getting a large drink with your sandwich because your going to need it to wash down every bite."}
{"text":"I like this location they do get super busy so have patience but the owners are great and the sandwiches are totally worth the wait it is also really clean and the remodel looks great...I love the Bobbie and well I guess all their food"}
{"text":"Well I love capriottis but this was not the best experience I've had by far. First off i do like the caps on Sahara and my hubby asked if it was the same owner ...the girl told us no and we explained how we go there cuz its close to work ...her response? \"im sorry\" and then went on to bash the owner of the other place...i understand competition but that was just not professional. I was actually going to give this place a better rating but then i found myself getting stabbed in the gums by a turkey bone from my Bobbie...i have a picture but unfortunately i don't know how to post it :( im by no means bashing this place but hope the staff will learn to have some class."}
{"text":"First time trying out this location. Pretty much standard of all the other locations of Capriottis I've been to. We ordered the cheesesteak and the Capastrami and they were delicious. Although next time I will remember to order an extra side of russian dressing because since their bread rolls tend to be on the thicker side its nice to have a little extra.
    Since I actually branched out and ordered something other than the Bobbie or the Slaw B Jo I was not let down. Definitely will continue having a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this Capriotti's location. If you've enjoyed a sandwich at any of their other locations, you'll enjoy them here. One benefit to visiting the GVR location is the abundance of seating. A lot of the other Capriotti's locations have limited seating but this one is part of a food court and there's plenty of places to sit."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of Capriotti's while my husband is not. I've never had a bad sandwich, until today. I got the Bobbie, the turkey was really dry. My husband got a turkey and provolone with the same dry turkey. The tomatoes were tasteless, sliced so thin, there wasn't anything to them. The lettuce was old.  Maybe because it was right before closing and they were trying to get rid of their ingredients. My husband said it was the worst sandwich he had ever eaten. He was starving and it was so bad he couldn't finish it.  This location is the first and last time we will go. Too bad it is close to the close."}
{"text":"Sandiwiches are great but what's up the chips? Every time I get chips there are only 5 in the bag WTF!!!!"}
{"text":"DISCLAIMER: I rarely review places because everywhere is hit and miss, and people are judgmental over the smallest things. 


Feb 4th, my wife purchased an online meal for pick up. I picked up her meal and came back to the wrong setting she SPECIFICALLY stated online, it was basically just substituting pastrami for chicken on the original capastrami sandwich. My wife spoke to prescilla about the issue and prescilla, store manager, and she told my wife that she would comp her next meal.

Today, March 13, 2016, I came in to get that comp meal. However, prescilla normally keeps tabs on who gets comp'd, but my wife's ticket wasn't there. No biggie, I didn't argue, but CRYSTAL went above and beyond and went to her district manager, DOUG, whom comp'd not just my wife's sandwich but also mine. I didn't ask for it, but the store is willing to definitely satisfy their customers. That's what I call 100% customer satisfaction. I'm not a personal to argue about little things but the gesture was beyond expected.

So THANK YOU Capriotti's for having a lifetime customer only at this store! I would give 15 stars if I could!!!"}
{"text":"The turkey cranberry stuffing sandwich was good. Lots of nice herb flavor in the stuffing. The bread was too bad... so... white bread and tasteless."}
{"text":"The bobbie sandwich is the tastiest thing ever. I laughed when family were explaining to me about cranberry and turkey!! i was like ewwww thats nasty! Until they told me to take a bite OMG! it was heaven. I have to try it with hot peppers! it was even better. The capistrami is great too. but my fav is cranberry. The philly cheesesteak is ok! but the bobby and capistrami is a must try! and capriotti's are all over but this one is prolly the best around service and food quality."}
{"text":"Excellent service, quick and painless. Best capriottis around!"}
{"text":"Always a fan of Capriotti's. Great sandwiches and chips. Seating is very limited tho. Employees did us just fine with the service and making our orders. Place is a little dirty though. They definitely need to clean a little more. But overall good food"}
{"text":"To my knowledge, this Capriotti's just got new management and staff. And they have a great team there that makes the best sandwiches. I knew the environment felt different this time around. Thank you Capriotti's."}
{"text":"I come here for the cheese steak, and quite frankly, I like that there's plenty of bread!...Oh boy, would I love to have some now!"}
{"text":"Sandwich was okay. But the place was dirty. Not the post lunch crowd dirty but the no one takes care of this place kind of dirty. I probs won't come back."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian and I think their vegetarian turkey sandwich is amazing!! Their vegetarian chicken cheesesteak is also great, but I like their turkey sandwich better. Food tastes pretty fresh and quality is decent for a sandwich chain. The inside of the restaurant looks cute and mostly clean, so another plus."}
{"text":"This place has great food.  I'm vegitarian so its hard to find places to eat in Las Vegas.  Capriotti's has great vegtarian turkey sandwiches.  The staff works VERY hard and they are always very friendly.  It gets pretty busy halfway through the day but they are still very fast making sandwiches.  I would reccomend to anyone."}
{"text":"I loved the sandwiches at the Mesa Capriottis, so I decided to try one of the North Scottsdale locations for lunch. I phoned in my order, and although it was a little hard to understand the gentleman on the phone becausehewastalkingreallyfastlikehowIamwriting, I had no problems getting my order in. 

When I arrived, my sandwiches hadn't been made quite yet, but it didn't take too long for them to finish making them. The \"small\" 9 inch size is huge! If I weren't such a pig, I could have been satisfied with half of my small size sandwich. 

I love their faux turkey sandwiches, so I went for the regular vegetarian turkey sandwich. The ingredients were fresh, and while I liked the cole-turkey version better, it was pretty good, and especially refreshing for a hot summer day!

The soda fountain has Pepsi products, and has diet Mountain Dew as well as diet Pepsi.

Overall, a good choice for a sandwich."}
{"text":"Big portions, fresh high quality ingredients, and good selections for both omnivores and vegetarians.  What's not to like about Capriotti's?  

We ordered the veggie turkey ($8.39 for 12 inch).  The faux turkey tasted almost exactly like real processed turkey, very nice!  There are a lot of good toppings you can choose from, ranging from the pedestrian lettuce and tomato to sweet and hot peppers.  The bread was a full 12 inches (Take that, Subway! :p), had a nice mix of outer crust with inner chewiness.  The sandwich filling had a great mix of sweet, salty, and acidic flavors.  Also unlike Subway, these sandwiches are probably twice as wide.

Service was fast and friendly.  I've found a new favorite sandwich spot for quick but tasty eats!"}

I asked the guy working if they ever clean, and he said \"sometimes\". Started looking around at everything and the whole store was disgusting!!! They need to be on dirty dining for sure. Will contact the health department"}
{"text":"Walked there from signature suites at mgm. I love the sandwiches.. So far I have had the bobby, cheesesteak, and capristrami. Small is like a medium and medium like a large. The capistrami is delist but the coleslaw got a littlest
Ty at the end. I would order it on the side next time. The Bobby seemed like it needed more mayo.otherwise tasted great.i love how all the sauce, meat stayed in the bun bc of the cool rolls.. cheesteak was tasty. Finished the medium there, wished the steak was a little thinner."}
{"text":"One star because the guys behind the counter were sweet and nice. Another because of price.

In short, my sandwich sucked and am upset because the guy recommended me to get the sandwich over my original order... it was the turkey something... which was pretty much a thanksgiving meal on wheat bread (turkey meat, cranberry, gravy). I ate the whole thing because I eat everything and because I was starving!

My cousin who is a local swears by this place. I apparently did not order the right thing. I had a taste of her sandwich (pastrami) and it was soo much better - wish I had ordered the pastrami."}
{"text":"Go there for lunch and the sandwich's are delicious. I always try to save half of my sandwich for the next day but I can't stop once I start it's that good!!!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since my last visit, and this will definitely be my last time ever.

First of all, don't offer a call ahead and pick up service if your employees are so fucking lazy and stoned that they can not hang the phone up right. I called 10 times with a busy time in a span of 10 minutes. Are you kidding me?! 

I get there and tell the employee I tried to call to place a order for pick up but can not because once again your phone is off the hook, he looks at me picks the phone up and sets it back and says \" that's weird \" . No I'm sorry no nothing

I order a HOT bobby and a Italian sausage and NOW I have to sit in this establishment for 30 fucking minutes ! On top of it people who came in after me got my food before me! Of course I get my bobby and it's NOT hot, I ask it to be put in a oven and they wrap it tin foil and set it on the grill. I fucking can't with this establishment. 


The only good employee was the young girl working today! The others are completely fucking worthless. The guy you have working the counter has a set speed of -1 and no urgency to get anything done in a timely matter no personality no NOTHING. I am so fucking done with this establishment, it needs to be shut DOWN. Waste of space. NO reason with two people in front of me that I should have sat there for 45 minutes waiting for 2 sandwiches . And it all could have been avoided if your employees hung the fucking phone up or management bought new phones. Corporate will be hearing from me."}
{"text":"I eat here at least once a week.  They know me by name and make the Bobbie just how I like it.  I switch it up between the Bobbie, grilled Italian or Ham and Cheese.  You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches.  Great service, friendly employees, excellent food."}
{"text":"Those that are my Yelp friends know my addiction to Caps by my check-ins via the Yelp App.  LOL  

Haven't tried any other sandwich but the cheese steak.  Why?  Cause the cheese steak is that awesome!  Get it with hot pepper, sweet pepper, and mushrooms ($1 extra for shrooms) - you wont be sorry!!  :)

If you haven't signed up for the Caps104 text (Text CAPS104 to 25328), and you are a patron of Caps, well then I shake my head at you!  You're missing out on tasty offers!!  :)"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches, I have had the Bobbie, pastrami and they are always good.  Service at this location was great served quickly and no problems."}
{"text":"The reason I went to this place is because of its five star rating on yelp,  and I was definitely not disappointed. I went for the medium chicken cheese steak and it was actually quite big. The chicken was really tasty, the peppers, onions and mushrooms were perfect, and the cheese just made everything that much better. 

The service was good, there was no line when I walked in for lunch, and I waited about 10 minutes for the sandwich to be prepared. There is parking on site so its easy to get to and eat there. 

I don't know how to express how good my sandwich is but I'd really like another one right now if that helps."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's. I've been eating their sandwiches for years and this location makes them as good as any other.

Most recently, my cousin and I came here after the Rebel win over the Horned Frogs. We had coupons from the game for a free small sub, so we couldn't pass up the opportunity. Apparently, we weren't the only ones with that idea. The place was pretty busy and it did take a little while to get our orders. I can't fault Capriotti's for that. It's a free sandwich after all.

We ended up taking our small Bobbie and small Capastrami to go. We split half of each and it was a delicious way to cap off a Rebel win. Capriotti's never disappoints."}
{"text":"I ate here on dec 12 2013 and got FOOD POISONING . I was sick for 2 days . Friendly service and good sandwiches do not make up for serving bad product to guests."}

{"text":"Capriottis is an old favorite. By far the best hot sandwich shop around! The turkey cranberry is good, but I never go wrong with the chicken cheesesteak! Just add hot peppers for perfection! 

They have indoor or great outdoor seating with even heaters in the winter!"}
{"text":"If you feel like eating a sandwich you definitely have to come to capriotti's.. they offer several different options but their most popular are their capastrami and their Bobby (must to try it) the mix of the ingredients does not sound that good, but believe me once you put it on your mouth you will love it."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER. These clowns don't need your business so just go elsewhere. It took TEN MINUTES for someone to pick up the phone. Then the brain dead slob on the other end said it would take 20 minutes to make a sandwich. 4pm on a Thursday, no customers in store. 6 losers jerking off behind the counter and no customers. 20 minutes?! Piss off CRAPRiotis I won't be back you  suck!"}
{"text":"Sandwich and Salad or Soup Combo? Hell Yahhh!

I had a bad expience at Capriotti's back in Reno. but this place is much better and has a cleaner look.  The parking is awful, but I don't hold that against them considering the area their in. 

I would argue there is better places nearby, but for quick inexpensive bite this is the best place."}
{"text":"My always to go spot, no matter the hour. I since i'm from the east side (NY), i always tend to get the cheesesteak. And it never disappoints..."}
{"text":"I really like the veggie turkey sandwiches available. However, I don't think it is physically possible to make a sandwich any slower than this location."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way out of Vegas and got sandwiches to go. I got the meatball hoagie (sub) and it was pretty good. Being Italian I am sometimes critical of meatballs, but these were great. The portion size is huge. I could hardly finish half. Worth a trip if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I wanted to add an update. I went here a few weeks ago and it was not a good experience. The owner reached out to me and offered 2 gift cards. I sincerely appreciate him reaching out and making an effort to rectify the situation.  I used the gift cards today. A young man named Shaquille I believe took my order. It was made in a timely fashion and he brought it to the table and asked if we needed anything else. Both sandwiches were good and all the issues from the first visit were corrected even the trash can. Thank you, I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I love me some Capriotti's, but didn't realize that this location was actually inside the courthouse until we got there. Oh well, pot committed, we went in. Shoes off, through the metal detector all for the Bobbie.

Look, Capriotti's is a local chain, so most of the sandwiches are gonna be the same from one location to the next. On the whole, I would give the entire franchise a 4 star, but this location gets knocked down to 3, just because of the spot inside. I still liked my sandwich, and I still will go to other Capriotti's locations, but I'm not seeking this one out again. It lacks the vibe I'm after for a sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Sooo...here's where I'm probably going to take a departure from the other reviews and the tribal knowledge that exists in my workplace.  I have been here two or three times now.  I've had the Bobby and yesterday I had the Capastrami.  I'm not sure what I had the other time because it was almost two years ago.  It's not bad...it's a decent sandwich.  It's nothing I'm willing to go out of my way for though.  Other than the kind of gimmicky \"Thanksgiving on a bun\" allure of the Bobby nothing else really stands out from any other sandwich place.  I would eat here if that's where people were going or if I just needed to stop to grab a quick sandwich (Especially considering they aren't much more than Subway and I do think it's better than that...) but I wouldn't go out of my way or recommend it as a \"Must do\" while in town."}
{"text":"First off, the service here is fantastic! The guy who made my sandwich was very friendly and had a great attitude! However, the sandwich I had was nothing to write home about! The bread was pretty tasteless just like the rest of the sandwich! The quality is not that great here, at least for the turkey sandwich!"}
{"text":"I have to start out by saying that I am a HUGE Capriottis fan.  I really do love their sandwiches, so it pains me to give this location such a bad review, but they truly deserve it.

I have been going to this location for many years & it always has been a sub-par location compared to the others.  I will actually travel out of my way and go to the Silverado & Vegas Blvd location rather then go to the Southern Highlands location if I can. 

I can't tell what is worse the customer service on the phone or in the store? There is no etiquette for taking orders over the phone. I order the same sandwich every time and each time they ask different questions on the phone, different ingredient options. I often get the feeling that they're not even sure what comes on their sandwiches. When I pick up the sandwich,  I never know what to expect.  

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers,  it appears the owner only recruits out of the skate park? Complementary \"F\" bombs and foul language at no extra charge.  On a positive side they always have sports on TV that he can watch while you're waiting for your food :) 

Do yourself a favor and skip this location. Sorry Capriottis :("}
{"text":"After waiting 15 minutes for the guy behind the counter just to start making my sandwich, after he skipped me, I asked for a refund. Getting a refund took another 7 minutes."}
{"text":"I think the guy behind the counter was new. He had to ask me what I wanted three times and my name twice and still got it wrong. I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Earned every star with their awesome sandwich. Totally surprised my wife and I on the quality.

On the way back from Vegas we just wanted something light and fast. My friend (thanks Ken) recommended this place, so we thought it'd be good to just have a sandwich for a change. We didn't know it was just a take-out place so we ended up taking it to go and plan to eat it in the car. While I was filling up the gas, my wife started to open the sandwich wrapper. I knew it was really really good because she didn't make any noise. SHe was too busy enjoying the Capastrami to think about sharing. So i had a bite and it was truly the best Pastrami. I got the Cheese Steak and it was amazing too.

We both agreed that this is a must come next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's! I always order the Bobbie from here, but in my recent visit I ordered the Bobbie as usual and I ended up finding a small bone in my sandwich. I wasn't very happy about it. I'm hoping this does not happen again."}
{"text":"I came here last Tuesday to buy my mom one of Capriotti's signature BOBBIEs. It honestly couldn't get any better than it already is. For $6.60 + tax, you get a 7\" sub of pure goodness. My friend first introduced it to me a couple of years ago \"It's basically a thanksgiving meal!\" she said and I have been hooked on the Bobbie ever since. 

The staff in this branch was friendly and the cashier saw to it that everyone was given personal treatment. He was very polite and courteous, definitely a personality that would keep customers. I liked the idea of black and white checks to surround the walls and floor tiles, It gave the place more character and made it feel more authentic."}
{"text":"If you've never heard of the bobbie, which I might consider capriotti's signature sandwich, it's basically thanksgiving between two pieces of bread...with lots of mayo.

In the mayo slathered bun we have real turkey (not the lunch meat BS), cranberry sauce, and stuffing. It tastes as good as it sounds and you can't tell if the turkey is dry or not because of all that mayo. She is a hearty and carby sandwich so it might be best to bobbie it up in moderation but you would be remiss to skip out on the tastes of a holiday, whenever, wherever, and in ergonomic cylindrical form."}
{"text":"This is a late review. I do not recommend this particular location. The owner or the guy with the New York accent that claims to be the owner has poor customer service skills and thinks he can talk to you anyway he pleases because he's the owner. I entered the restaurant to ask if I could use my coupon I received for a free sandwich for buying 9 sandwiches. He literally starts yelling at me because it expired the day prior. When I told him I was leaving due to his rude manners he blamed me, stating I was agressive. I just laughed and started to leave. He apologized and made the free sandwich. But I will never go back."}
{"text":"O wow. I forgot how good this place is. The turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce sandwich makes you want to... melt. Next time you come to Las Vegas, stop by here when you aren't gambling, drinking,  or eating at the higher-end restaurants."}
{"text":"We used Capriotti's for our corporate retreat and there are a few glaring reasons as to why I would never choose to use them again. 

First the good:
While trying to set up our 2 days worth of orders online the system would not allow me to confirm my purchases so I had to call the location to do so.  Brandon was EXTREMELY helpful and patient and easily set up our orders with no problem.  I felt confident upon hanging up with him that our order would arrive just as dictated. 

Capriotti's food was excellent! All of us enjoyed the subs, salads and cookies/brownies we received.  I was worried the food would not be enough but in the end we had more than enough for our 45 person event.  We could have actually ordered less food but the leftovers did not go to waste. 

Now the not so great :
Our event was at UNLV and all of us had flown in from around the country. This meant that not only did we not know the exact location of our classroom in relation to the parking/loading zones but we did not have a cart or dolly at our disposal to use for catering.  When it comes to catering one would expect a local, long established deli like Capriotti's to know where they are going and also to have the necessary equipment to make the delivery process as easy for their client as possible. 
Not in this case. For both days. 

First delivery day : Our classroom was on the 2nd floor and about a 6-8 minute walk to the parking lot. Our delivery driver did not have a cart.  He carried two large bags holding 50 bottles of soda and made one trip to our classroom. I carried multiple bags and on the 2nd trip out had 2 of my coworkers come assist me in grabbing the trays of sandwiches we ordered. I would like to point out we paid him a $70 tip (20%)..he was paid this even though the majority of our catering was carried in by us. Uh..yea. 

Second delivery day: A classroom change meant that our room was now in a different part of the campus and that the loading zone was actually right outside the back door.  I called the store to tell them of this change and had to deal with some girl chastising me for \"her delivery driver having to walk a long distance and up multiple flights of stairs to drop off all our catering\".  I enjoyed setting her straight....no, WE carried the majority of our order in and how unprofessional to be providing catering yet have no cart and how ridiculous it was to expect your customers to provide one for this purpose.   Needless to say this clerk was extremely out of line and also had no clue as to what she was talking about since her delivery driver was a liar. 

When our food came that day our driver carried in..surprise, surprise, NOTHING...thank goodness I had 2 coworkers come out with me to help..since I figured that would be the case. 
He still got a tip though -- this time $50  on the same amount that was delivered the day before. I made the decision to reduce his tip but since it wasn't completely up to me I still had to give him one...It it has been up to me he would have received $0.  What did he do? NOTHING.

Add to it that although we had the exact same orders both days it was only on day 2 that we received small tubs of condiments (mustard, mayo, pickles, etc) for our sandwiches.  That was a little annoying. 

Overall Capriotti's has great food and the catering is perfect for large crowds but the delivery driver is AWFUL.  Not only a liar -- as I found out when the clerk relayed his story of delivery to us from day 1 on day 2 - but if you are hiring a restaurant to cater they should at the very least bring the food in for you. 

For those reasons alone for any future corporate events in Vegas we will be skipping using Capriotti's and I highly suggest anyone considering their catering do the same.

Well unless you happen to have a cart lying around to bring your food in or you feel like tipping someone for doing very little.  That's up to you."}
{"text":"Not good and overpriced. One of my friends hyped this place up so I was excited to try it and it was a huge let down. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE!!!!  The restaurant stinks like its dirty. It took so long to make my Sandwhich (30min when I was the only person in line) that I thought they were slaughtering the turkey out back. The food was so bad we ended up throwing it away. My cat wouldn't even touch it. Do not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times and all times the workers were lovely and efficient. Personally, I like to do take out because I like to take my Sammies home and toast them before I inhale them but I've had the Bobbie, Capastrami & Slawbe Joe and I always go with the Bobbie every time now."}
{"text":"Capriotti's such an awesome sandwich place and Always Love the Bobbie, thanksgiving anytime of the year on a sandwhich. Always my first choice. I remember when first moving to Vegas I hadn't ever heard of Capriotti's. Didn't even know about the Bobbie so I had order the  chicken cheese steak.it was good but once discovering the Bobbie there was no competing it. 

Always recommend the Bobbie and Capriotti's whenever someone wants a good sandwich that's just a little different than what they are used to. The prices are not unreasonable and definitely great to get the big one and share with someone for the value you get. Or just get the biggest size and keep leftovers for yourself because who doesn't like Thanksgiving leftovers."}
{"text":"It was a bad day yesterday and the staff here treated me better than I deserved. I made a mistake on our order and they were gracious to me to even fix my mistake with no complaints. Thank you for great customer service and great food! Your kindness will be remembered forever! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service! I told the gentleman I had not been feeling well and he suggested a cold turkey sandwich and soup. I really felt better and was grateful for the help! My husbands sandwich was great too! I love their tortilla soup. This location is very nice and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Sandwich was amazing. Better than subway and quiznos.  Too bad it's only in vegas."}
{"text":"This is a CRAPRIOTTI'S

   Capriotti's is a casual fast food restaurant chain that specializes in cold and warm subs. Their signature sandwich: the Bobbie was voted the best sandwich by AOL in 2009. Regardless that the majority of the 106 Capriotti's are in Las Vegas, their first location was established in Delaware back in 1976. Unfortunately, I am reviewing a different place than Capriotti's because the place that I stepped inside of yesterday fails to abide by company promotions. This is a review on a Crapriotti's abbreviated Crap that is Capriotti's in name. 

   I have yet to try a Capriotti's sandwich. When I look at Yelp pictures, my mouth salivates because they look good. Capriotti's - THAT MEANS EVERY LOCATION-was promoting the 2 For 2. The promotion is that you get a 6 inch sandwich and soup for $2. The promotion was active til the 19th. After work, I made a beeline for this location. Squeezed in between Eastern Avenue, Serene Avenue, Interstate 215, and shops; the parking lot is difficult to get in n Out of. Ha! That's funny because In N Out is in the parking lot. If the experience was good the ordeal of the compacted and congested parking lot would be worth it. 

   Upon walking inside one of the few kids working here  greeted me. I let him know that I wanted the 2 for 2 promotion. He informed me that this franchise owner was not doing this promotion and that I would have to drive to the Anthem location. He'd tell another customer the exact thing. Interesting! Next to me was a mutant  picture sign promoting the 2 for 2. The kid went on to say that the franchise owner also took the promotion off this location's Facebook page. 

  The 2 for 2  developed into a 1 for 1. This would be my one and only visit here and I was going to rate it 1 star. This franchise owner is not a team player. It is pure greed to not abide by a company promotion and consequently cheat customers out of their time and to shove the money losing promotion on the back of another franchisee. This is a franchise owner that is penny wise and dollar foolish. Capriotti's did not come up with this promotion to loose money. No way! The idea was to introduce customers to their sandwiches and hoping they will return. In addition to the greed, I distrusted the kids making the sandwiches. When I walk in a restaurant and see all kids minus management, a mental red flag appears. And when the kid is telling me that Silverado Ranch Road, which is two traffic signals south on Eastern is Anthem that is three miles south; I don't want him making my food. In a way it is a good thing that this franchisee didn't abide by the company promotion. 

   In the future it is a possibility that I will try my first Capriotti's sandwich at the Anthem location. But never will I return to this Crapriotti's unless I see the \"Under New Ownership\"  sign that could make this location  worthy of the Capriotti's name."}
{"text":"The Daniel. S 2016 National Calendar Day 25 Review Challenge: Review 8/25

    Today is one of the National Calendar Days that I am celebrating and yelping in 2016. It is National Hoagie Day. This National Calendar Day celebrates the hoagie which is a regional name for the hero, sub, or zeppelin. Where would I enjoy a hoagie after work? My investigative Internet search led me to Capriotti's. I got in my car and made a beeline down Eastern Avenue to the Capriotti's at the northwest corner of Warm Springs Road in the Albertson's - anchored shopping center. 

   National Hoagie Day marks the first time ever that I dined in a Capriotti's. Isn't that something that I lived in Las Vegas for close to 12 years and haven't dined in a Capriotti's? And isn't it something how celebrating some of the National Calendar Days leads people to new places, foods, and experiences? Now that National Hoagie Day led me here, I will report on my experience at the Eastern and Warm Springs Capriotti's. 

   This appears to be one of the older Capriotti's. If I am not mistaken, the oldest Capriotti's is off Sahara Avenue near the Strip. This certainly is a small Capriotti's. When I looked to the right there was the counter, paper menus, and overhead menu. When I looked to the left there was the imitation brick wall in back of a long skinny row table, eleven stools, a refrigerator, Pepsi fountain, and Wise potato chip rack. When I looked straight ahead the skinny public area dead-ended at a wall minus rest rooms. Restrooms are nonexistent. When I looked down, my smartphone was installing the Capriotti's app. 

    If I were to turn into a Capriotti's fan, the app would reward me with a complimentary hoagie, or as we call it in this part of the country a sub, after nine purchases. Instantaneously, it rewarded me $2 off my purchase for joining. 

   Prior to stepping foot inside this Capriotti's, I read all this positive praise for their Bobbie sandwich. Wikipedia stated that in 2009 AOL voted the Bobbie as the best sandwich in America ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capriotti%27s) and people have rated it highly. The upshot was that the Bobbie was the Star of National Hoagie Day 2016. 

   When I walked inside I picked up a paper menu to look at the options. I chose the small hoagie (sub) for $7.29. If this 9 inch hoagie (sub) is considered small, I'd love to see their large one. Ordering it could be slightly confusing. There is a want for an \"order here\" sign. Upon ordering the young women working here were friendly and one of them explained the Capriotti's app to me as it gave me my first discount. The young woman also let me know that the app also rewards me on my Birthday. 

    During my visit, it was apparent that the Pepsi soda fountain could use repair. When I poured the Dr. Pepper the handle would get stuck. Come to think of it, how come Pepsi doesn't have a Freestyle machine? 

   The Bobbie was ready in a few minutes. The paper wrapping it came in is an attractive touch. It felt like I was opening my Christmas present when it was a National Hoagie Day present. Ideally the Bobbie celebrates Thanksgiving. Between the long pieces of bread is a valley of stuffing, pushed turkey, cranberry sauce, and mayonnaise. This was a cold sandwich. And it was a loaded sandwich where the stuffing overflowed out of the valley of bread onto the paper below. With the exception of once biting into a bone, the Bobbie was delectable. 

    If there is a National Bandwagon Day count me out. I simply tell it how I see it. The way I see it is that the Bobbie is good at the same time it is not on the top tier. I prefer the hoagies (subs) that I have chowed down in Firehouse Subs over the Bobbie. If there is a return visit to Capriotti's, the Capastrami and Slaw Be Jo are my first choices."}
{"text":"Where Hard Rock and UNLV territory converge stands another Las Vegas icon: Capriotti's. Where the Hard Rock to the west celebrates rock and roll and UNLV to the east celebrates the Rebels, Capriotti's celebrates award winning sandwiches. Since the first Capriotti's opened in Delaware back in 1976, there Bobi sub has achieved \"Best sandwich of the year\" on numerous occasions. Locally the rewards would keep on coming. In 2016 \"Desert Companion\" readers voted Capriotti's as The Best Sandwich. In 2015 the Las Vegas Review Journal voted Capriotti's Best Fast Food plus Best Sandwich. Now on Saturday, July 8; I voted to eat at this very Capriotti's. 

  What is seriously missing in the Hard Rock Hotel is fast food restaurants. If you are up for fast food in the Hard Rock, you are literally stuck between a rock and a hard place. With the exception of the brand new Dunkin Donuts you are left to leave the hotel and walk to the crossroads of Paradise and Harmon where there are a cluster of restaurants. One of them is the Capriotti's in the CVS-anchored plaza at the northeast corner. 

  Being at the crossroads of the Hard Rock Hotel and UNLV it is a 24 hour Capriotti's. So, if you ever want a craving of the Bobi at 2 a.m., or are going cold turkey for a cole turkey late at night; this location will satisfy it. 

  I was impressed with the service, food, and price. After presenting the friendly cashier with $11 and change, my medium (12 inch) Cole Turkey and fountain cup were ready. Considering that this location is at the eastern boundary of the Resort Corridor, they do not price gouge. Before sitting at a table beside a brick wall, I filled up my cup with Dr. Pepper from the Pepsi fountain. I could not help but notice the Rebels pictures and that they sell Wise potato chips. 

  Capriotti's mission statement reads: \"to share our passion one sandwich at a time.\" They have a generous way of sharing their passion. Their medium sandwich was gigantic. I could only imagine how large their 20 inch large sandwich is. They share their passion one sandwich at a time through quantity and quality. I am a fan of the Cole Turkey. Why wouldn't I be? According to the official Capriotti's menu, they slow roast a Butterbowl turkey. This savory turkey is joined with cole slaw, Russian dressing, mayo, and provolone cheese. Capriotti's slogan, \"Extraordinary since 1976,\" best summarizes this Cole Turkey experience."}
{"text":"Came here and bought a 1/2 Bobbie and 1/2 broccoli cheddar soup. There was a wait for them to take the order but food was received quickly after ordering. The bobbie was tasty but very cold felt like the sandwich was in the freezer. The soup thought was the BLANDEST I have ever had. It literally tasted like warm milk with frozen broccoli florets in it. Not a hint of salt or pepper I couldn't even finish it. My husband said his cheese steak was good but they charge .80 for mushrooms which is odd."}
{"text":"Perhaps it's because everyone raves about this place having amazing sandwiches that I expected something GREAT!

But it wasn't. My friends had me try the Bobbie going on about how it's Thanksgiving in your mouth. It was not good to me. The texture just felt soft and mushy and all I could taste was overly sweet mixed with mayo.

Maybe their other sandwiches are good but they don't look all that appetizing and with the first experience, I'm not stoked on finding out. 

If I want a good sandwich I think I'll stick with Jersey Mike's which is nearby."}
{"text":"One word BOBBIE !!! It's the best sandwich ever created!

These guys and gals make the best sandwich on the planet. Every other sub shop just can't come close to the magical thanksgiving day celebration that takes place in your belly after consuming one of these masterpieces!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst service and quality food I've ever had!!! I've always loved Capriotti's ,  until I went to this location. I ordered as soon as I walked in and then noticed over the counter the floor (all of it) was covered in food.  Obviously from the entire day's work as it was just before closing that I went in. Even the counters were gross!! 
4 more people ordered after me and all 4 received their food before me! I was forgotten. Finally I received my order to go and went home to find not only the wrong sandwich I ordered but there was virtually almost no meat or anything on the bun.  It was literally mostly all bun. And looked aweful. Thrown together without a care.  I didn't even bother going back for them to correct it.  
Because of this I will never go to any Capriotti's ever again !! Those guys totally put me off it. To bad!! 
Management by the way was there and couldn't care less about the business!
Whoever owns this place needs to clean house, clean the floors and everything else and care about his or her business !!
To bad !!!  I seriously doubt I will get any response from this post but let's see !!"}
{"text":"Very close to where we live... we looked that! We went in about 20 minutes before closing time which is early for Vegas but that's okay. Closing procedures were in the process with cleaning, etc so I person was concentrating on that while the other person was helping us. At first, my concern was if the cleaning of the crafting table was some how going to contaminate the building of our sandwiches so I would have preferred not to have seen that being done just before our sandwiches were being made. I did observe the person doing the cleaning, wash her hands before starting our sandwiches so that was a positive. 
We got an Hot Italian and The Bobby, both to go. Both were good... but if you are a Thanksgiving lover of Turkey, dressing and cranberry sauce... get The Bobby! It is real chunks of turkey with this awesome dressing and cranberry sauce and the sub roll takes the place of the dinner roll. It really is awesome!!! The only thing I would add if it was an option... just a little turkey gravy as a drizzle. And a slice of apple pie ala-mode like grandma use to make. Hey... and here you don't have to eat a green bean casserole! Lol."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Capriotti's I have ever had the steak was so dry and has a bad taste  also I found 4 hairs in my sandwich!!!! the coleslaw was so old the the cabbage was half black!"}
{"text":"Poor excuse for a sub. 35 percent of steak and cheese sub had no meat. Will submit photo that says it all."}
{"text":"This is a great sandwich shop and the owner is so personable.  There is soon to be 20 of these restaurants in California.  Many in the San Diego area.  One currently in Beverly Hills."}
{"text":"DELISH!! A must place pit-stop when in Vegas. Located near the Hard Rock Hotel you can walk here but a cab ride down is well worth the trip.  

We wanted to order a sandwich that best describes the joint so we got a Cap's Special- Capastrami. Hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and COLE SLAW! The sandwich seriously melted in my mouth! The tang of the cole slaw complimented the pastrami just perfect! The bread was soft and easy to bite into. What makes this joint different is the construction of the sandwich. There wasn't an overflow of ingredients which made for easy eating.

What was disappointing was there were wasn't a selection of different sides other than chips. It would be nice to have a soup or salad with my sandwich.

I have to come back to try all their sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to this location and i had a great experience. The guy that took my order was friendly and polite. I tipped them using my debit card and he was thankful for it. I will come back again"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I were starving during our trip to Vegas and I looked up Yelp for a good sandwich shop. I didn't want to go someplace we have access to in CA. The guy who took our order was really nice, everything came out perfect, and was delicious. Not very expensive, very filling. Will definitely go back the next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"capri-whatt?!?!? o is this pastrami heaven? 

Found you lil bugger!  Known for its hot pastrami sandwich, we came in on a lil humble cloudy day and decided to be a lil bad (for my diet).

Their sandwiches come in different size...the largest...20\"...o my =O!

Stick to what it is and even though im not a big fan of coleslaw...i have to admit, its really good with the sandwich.

The hot pastrami sandwich consists of pastrami (duh), coleslaw with russian dressing, which i believe its like thousand island and something....the creaminess of the dressing cuts down the TANG of the coleslaw and the cole slaw gives the sandwich the crunch and cuts down the pastrami taste and teh saltiness of it.  Everything works well...it's definitely a recommendation from me (a picky ass eater)...the bread is a lil soft, not crunchy so its doesnt hurt you when you bite into it, esp for them drunkards....

even though theres not a lot of ingredients, its a very filling meal and i even took my share home for later.  

i only wish it wasnt off the strip but i think its best that way!  
ITS A MUST GO! GO GO GO....

p.s. if you dont love sandwiches, i believe they have other stuff and they have chips and soda and its pretty decent in price....its like a local joint to chill =)"}
{"text":"BS ++

Very good and wholesome sandwiches.  I came here by accident wanting some Greek food.  This place serves good NYC style heros.  I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a big sandwich.  The pastrami is a little salty but I would kill that with mustard.  The sandwiches are big that you won't even finish it all.  I wouldn't recommend the CLAM CHOWDER.  It's more of a potato chowdaaahh.  It's right off Blue Diamond.  It's good if you are into sammiches.

{"text":"I have been eating Capriotti's for over a decade.  They opened this location recently and I have been in before and everything was fine; good food and friendly service.  Not so much today.  We arrived a little before 12:20 and the polite cashier took our order and we paid by 12:20.  It is now 12:58 and my husband has no food.  It took over 20 minutes for my Italian sandwich to be made and it was mediocre at best, the veggies aren't as fresh as I am used to.  At minute 30 my husband asked about his sandwich (he is a tall and friendly guy) and was told with attitude that they didn't have a ticket with his food on it.  He was then ignored while workers snapped at each other to make his food.  I worked in an expensive seafood restaurant and know what customer service is and this isn't it.  There was no apology and I am frankly livid.  It has now been over 40 minutes with no food and no acknowledgement whatsoever.  People that came in 5 minutes ago have their food while my husband sits hungry.  Any sort of apology or act of remorse or care would be great and I will update if one comes.  If not I will drive out of my way to never come here again.

Update:  After 46 minutes my husband received his cheesesteak.  It is hot and delicious and he got an apology from the cashier.  It seems to be her first job but she tried and I commend her for that.  Whoever owns/ manages this location better look at their staff and figure it out or they will lose business for sure."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last weekend because I had to try the Bobbie. I'm a sucker for thanksgiving in a sandwich so this seemed like it would be right up my alley. Sadly it was just \"ok\". The sandwich is really dry. That turkey was definitely not roasted that day, it was very tough and the dark meat was gamy. 

Left up to me I think I'd figure out a way to cut the stuffing by half and add gravy instead of mayo. Call me crazy but I think sweet potatoes would be amazing in the sandwich too. 

The atmosphere was trendy/hipster and parking was very easy. 

I may go back and try a different sandwich but will just have to wait another month for thanksgiving leftovers to make my own sandwiches."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's my fave is the Italian with everything on it! This location is always busy I usually call in my order and it's always ready on time it's a great location!"}
{"text":"Visited this location yesterday, sad to say the only reason I am giving it 3 stars is due to my husbands Italian being pretty good. The Bobby absolutely sucked! Come on guys, what is so difficult about this sandwich? We got a two 9in sandwiches this time and the bobby was pathetic! I've seen more meat on a kids sandwich! Plus I asked for extra mayo, this sandwich was dry as hell.
Vibe of the store was very stiff. There was an entirely new staff working. Someone help this store get up and running to Cappriotti's standards! It's such a great location but we have decided that once our sandwich coupons are up (given from previous catastrophe) we will go to our usual location. I had such high hopes, unfortunately 2 out 3 visits sucked so you're fired!"}

NOT COOL. 

Didn't want to have to do the CHARGEBACK but since they want to be dicks about it, time to do that and contact Corporate. 

Hey Yelp, I wish we could give out NEGATIVE STARS....

********************************************

Unfreakinbelievable. I go through the hassle of online ordering....it's a hassle since their crappy online page uses Flash it blocks iOS devices from ordering. So I go online with the laptop, place my order, get in the car to head out and get a call: Sorry, we're out of bread and we closed the store an hour ago!

ARE YOU FREAKIN KIDDING ME?

I have never, EVER had anyone cancel an online order on me, and when a sandwich shop can't even keep their most basic item, bread, in stock, then they've got a damn problem. 

Venting my frustration even more.... I finally got a whole group of people to figure out what they wanted to eat and jump through a byzantine crappy website only to get told sorry...we can't get our head out of our rear end enough to order enough damn bread....

Oh and they want me to come by the store to process the debit card refund sometime tomorrow...I have a damn job, I don't have time to come back and deal with stupidity. Refund? How about I pick up the phone and yell CHARGEBACK to my credit card company tonight instead! 

Placement on my Jackassery! list is about as guaranteed as it gets. 

I don't do stupid and clueless, and especially not when social media lets me light you up over it. And this experience was an example of both."}

{"text":"This place knows subs!!!  We went here at the recommendation of a friend and so glad we made the trek from the strip to give this place a try.  Since we had never been before, we went with 2 of the signature subs.  My friend got the Italian and I got the Roast Beef.  Both were packed with tons of delicious meats and really fresh veggies.  The Italian has a good mix of premium italian meats which were not too salty. 
For the Roast Beef, I got all of the fixins' to include sweet peppers, onions, italian seasoning and oil & vinegar.  The roast beef was shredded which was a nice touch over your standard sliced meat at other sub shops.  

In writing this review, I just found out there's one in Encino so I can't wait to try it out when I get back home!  

Good stuff here!"}
{"text":"Great place. Management is very good. Even gave me free food when i was homeless. My hat goes off to yall thanks..BE SAFE!!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to a Capriotti's, first at this location.  It looks like a new location located in the shopping area in Summerlin.  We arrived at around 1pm and found it to be pretty empty.  No lines.  
Restaurant/Ambiance:  Clean and bright.  Quite a contrast from the one I had visited off the strip.  Decent amount of tables indoors as well as outdoors.  The restrooms were clean.  
Service:  You order at the counter.  Cashiers were friendly and met us with a smile.  Food was brought out to our table by a server.  He was quick to ask if we needed extra plates or utensils.  We had to request for the peppers.  But other than that, no complaints with service.
Food:  They pretty much have the same menu if I recall.  I went with the basic and got the Bobbie, Cheesesteak, and the Pastrami.  I was never a fan of the Bobbie.  But the cheesesteak and pastrami were both pretty good.  Was it the best sandwich ever, no.  But it was good.  We got the large and it was pretty darn big.  Easily could have been split.  I got the turkey chili and thought it was bland.  We also ordered the balsamic chicken salad and that was ok (a tad too much dressing).  

All in all, a decent sandwich shop.  Prob not one that I would drive out of the way for."}
{"text":"By far, the best sandwiches I've ever had. I find myself craving these sandwiches about once a week, but I don't live in Vegas so I plan Vegas trips just to go and eat here. just kidding. 

One word.... \"Capristrami\" 

Go get one!"}
{"text":"Really big subs with plenty of filling. The Bobby is their most famous sub because it is super indulgent. Basically, it is Thanksgiving dinner between two pieces of bread. Lots of moist turkey, stuffing, mayo and cranberry sauce. Don't bother looking up the calories or nutritional facts because it's so good you could care less anyways. Service is fast and because they get crowded and busy during lunch hour, I suggest calling your order in ahead of time for easy pick up. They also carry a particular brand of potato chips called Owl Brand and it is pretty good. It's a thick cut Kettle style chips and the honey BBQ flavor is popular. Overall, good place for hearty subs, but only once in a while if you are watching calories. Service is usually fast and friendly too."}
{"text":"I decided to have a treat day and since it's been a while I've had Capriotti's, it was the obvious choice (oh, and it's right next to my dry cleaners). I ordered the Grilled Italian for myself and the Capistrami for the fiancé (his favorite). The service was fabulous (I got a good laugh out of them cheering about \"beer money\" when I tipped) and of course, it smelled delicious in there. Oh, and they carry treats from Nothing Bundt Cakes in their fridge (next to the bottled beverages)! Ahh, I almost gave in too.

I wish I could have eaten the sandwich fresh that afternoon, but I had to drive them all the way home (30 minutes) and the bread was a tad soggy from the moisture and the sandwich contents. That did not take away from the tantalizing smell I had to endure for the whole trip and the deliciousness when I finally got to dig in (yeah, it didn't even make it to the table). OMGOODNESS, soo good! Party in my mouth. I hardly order hot sandwiches and I was a little skeptical about the Grilled Italian, but it was amazing. Next time I'll opt for the hot peppers along with the sweet peppers because I think it needs that spice. I also tried a few bites of the Capistrami (I've had it before) and oh, DROOL. Their meat is great.

I can't wait for my next trip here to try another sandwich. Oh, and obviously, the Bobbie is one of the greatest sandwiches that ever lived. Eat it. Even if you don't like cranberry sauce or Thanksgiving dinners. That good."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this location since i moved here in 08 about 3 or 4 times a month and never once have i had to show id. So the manger thought it would be funny to send me out to the car 3 different times  to get my id. As for the sandwich its always hit or miss sometimes it will be good other times super dried out and over cooked. I will be going to Jersey Mikes from here on out."}
{"text":"Great food. Beats subway by far love the Cheese steak sandwich with both sweet and spicy peppers"}
{"text":"Capriotti's the chain in general is the bombest sandwich spot in the game . But this specific location is a piece of shit . It says 24 hours and it's 3:45 and bald dude said he had a to go order that  was priority and wouldn't serve us . He locked the doors and when I called on the business line he purposely forwarded my calls right in front of me . I'm extremely disappointed because I had 11 people with me in my wedding entourage . We paid for three cabs to get there and we were turned away in the rudest fashion . I hope this person is fired or put on early morning shifts for punishment . As a chef I don't condone laziness and that's the vibe I got from him . Eat at capriotti's in Reno that's the best location I've ever been to or even the one in San Jose . Fuck that bald dude and his executive decisions to close when it clearly says open 25 hours. What if I wanted a bottle of water or some soup or something random . Fuck you bald guy. Fuck you in your bald ass"}
{"text":"Just came from this sandwich shop.  First off, that little blonde girl UNFIENDLY  as hell!!!!!
When my son-in-law asked if they had military discount, she had the nerve to reply \"why do the military need a discount?\". First off chick, if it wasn't for the military, your ass would not be free and protected!!! Get a grip...maybe she thought we were Mexican?  

So what, what does it matter?  BTW, ALL FOUR OF US ARE HAWAIIAN....


TO ALL YOU VETERANS, DO  NOT GO HERE!!!! THEY SUCK!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came I saw I got the pastrami and it torn it up! Love this place"}
{"text":"Came in at about noon, quite a few people in there enjoying lunch but the tables that were open were clean and plenty! I have a friend that goes to school near by so I ordered and waited for him to get there thinking it might take a while with lunch time and all. They were super fast! I love the open concept that you can see into the kitchen and see them making your food. All the workers were super friendly and helpful! Definitely will come back. Sandwiches are great and customer service is amazing!"}
{"text":"Me and the wife stopped by here on a Friday night and man what a great surprise this was. The sandwiches were the best we have ever had in AZ, she had the Cole turkey which has mayo fresh turkey and Cole slaw don't know what it is but damn it was delicious. I had the Grilled Italian with onions sweet peppers and mushrooms all on top of grilled Italian meats and melted cheese. best sandwich I have ever had, flavor explosion in your mouth . this place is awesome you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This used to be a franchise shop...and it was great.  I would have given it 5 stars.  Since the owner sold the franchise back to corporate it is still really good...service is just not as great.  The food is still top notch.  The Capastomi sandwich is sooooo good.  Grilled pastrami on top of cole slaw...yes cole slaw with Russian dressing.  I'm not a big fan of cole slaw, but it absolutely makes this sandwich.  My family call the Capastromi sandwich \"Unicorn Meat\"...it's so good it's mythical.  Be sure to try out the \"Dragon Meat\" sandwiches at Phoenix Cheesesteak Co.  :)"}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE. This is the WORST Capriottis ever. The staff is completely incompetent. I have been here at least 3 times and every single time there has been an issue. 2 of the times I would be waiting for my sandwiches (15 mins) and then someone would come out and say that they messed it up and are remaking them (another 15 mins). The last time I ordered the woman literally repeated my order back 4 times. 4 TIMES. And they still messed it up. I gave this place a few tries but I will  never return to this Capriottis."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. The employee who took care of me couldn't have seem less interested, and I'm not entirely certain she wasn't stoned. 
They advertise things they don't carry. The atmosphere sucks and the service is awful. Don't go to this one."}
{"text":"Mmmm, I loves me some sandwiches! The Italian with everything is awesome. I grew up in Vegas and every time I visit, I do my best to pack one away. Well, okay, half of one."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time on any other sandwich than the cole-turkey.  Coleslaw, russian dressing, provolone, and fresh/REAL roasted turkey, all on a hearty roll.  Portions are huge, pricing is moderate, and otherwise this is just your average sandwich joint."}
{"text":"EUREKA!!!  I've found more Capriotti's that are open later hours! 
F*'in AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Did you know that Marky Mark is the same person as Mark Wahlberg?

And why did I mention this?  Because that is what the three workers (one I know was a manager) were debating about while I was waiting for my sandwich...and sandwich that was waiting to be handed to me.  Five minutes later....my name was called....another employee gave it to me...while the three guys were still talking about Marky Mark.  

I was told that I had to go to this \"amazing sandwich\"...the best sandwich in America.  Well...service wise...this place is awful.  The guy taking my order had severe ADD...(would you like a drink with that?  \"No thank you\"...ok would you like a regular or large drink?  Or!  \"What is the total?\"  Moron behind the counter...\"The cookie is $1.29)  Food wise?  There was nothing...absolutely NOTHING about that sandwich (Chicken Cheesesteak)  that would make me forget about the bad counter service so I would go back.  The chicken was bland and extremely greasy.  I am still feeling the effects of the pit in my stomach of bottomless grease.

Sorry Caprioti's....not going back."}
{"text":"With visiting Las Vegas comes the search for food. We were staying at the Hard Rock Hotel and so my roomies decided to go across the street to find some since we wanted some pizza. Luckily for us, right next to the pizza place is Capriottis! I saw my buddies walk in with two long subs. Initially, I was going for the pizza until I found out they got a Cheese Steak! So, I decided to try it and oh man.... it was amazing!

The bread was perfect and the sandwich was filled with delicious steak cooked to perfection, melted white American cheese, mushroom, onions, and hot peppers, which gave it an awesome kick!  Always, always, always add the mushroom, onions and definitely the hot peppers. You will not regret it! Everything was perfectly melted together and the taste was Mmmm Mmmm good! I couldn't stop with one bite or just a small portion. I'll just say that we ended up going back to get more the next day.

The service is awesome here and the guys are really awesome. That's always icing on the cake when the service is excellent. Also, this place is open really late. So, if you have the late night cravings going on, check them out and you'll be able to get your fill from Capriottis!"}
{"text":"We were driving toward this location (3/4 of a mile away) at 7:35pm today when we called for a pickup order of 2 sandwiches. Trying to be courteous, as they close at 8, we called ahead. We were told by the guy to call another Caprioti's that closes at 9pm. She was told it was too late for pickup orders. So then she said well we'll be there in a few minutes and maybe then they'd like to make us some sandwiches? By then he kind of changed his tune, but I was already irritated.  Off to a biz that wanted money. Why can't these small businesses treat customers right?  Do these workers understand they are going to be replaced by machines? The service will certainly be better.  With large sandwiches inching closer to $20 each now, you're better off going to a true restaurant. You clowns won't be getting any more beer money from me."}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhhhh 
Maybe visited twice in 10 years 
My friend owned one
I like thier Thanksgiving sandwich
But the bread is too hard for me. 

I know some people are die hard for them
Service and cleanliness are fine to me. But not my first choice 
There are some nice employees there though"}
{"text":"I have ordered 10 sandwiches from this location two times and the last two weeks. That is $70 worth of sandwiches * 2. Evidently the online order goes to their corporate account, and they send a driver out to try to follow directions. Last week, the driver showed up at our business on the first floor, but didn't know how to get to the second floor. As far as I'm concerned, that's easy. You take an elevator. Again today my company and I ordered 10 more sandwiches, again another $70 yes. 2 hours later the sandwiches didn't show up, so I called Capriotti's on Paradise Ice. The girl who answered the phone told me that the driver could not find our address. She said that they still had all of the sandwiches with him or her, and they would be on their way. One of my biggest concerns was that all 10 of the sandwiches had mayonnaise on them and I didn't want any of my employees or managers to get sick. She assured me that the driver is in route to our business. Another hour goes by and still no sandwiches. I am done with this business. Supposably they refunded my credit card for the $70, however I still have not seen that credit on my bank account statement."}
{"text":"I love capriotti's but it's way too high in sodium which is why it's just so tasty. I wish they gave us the option to choose wheat bread over white though. If I had the cash I would definitely invest in a capriotti's. If this place was 24/7 then I would give it another star."}
{"text":"Capriotti's sandwich is made with great tasting meats with added salt to enhance the flavor. Be careful, if you don't respect the sandwich you'll get addicted to it like I did when I first tried it.

Bread options are slim to none, maybe that's because I don't specifically ask for it but you usually get the white bread.

Inside of the sandwich is just filled with tasty meats but are a bit salty, but you can't really notice it. It gets you right underneath the tongue. The meats are of higher than average quality and you can really taste the vegetables. 

Texture is soft and easy to consume

Experience of it is worth the try but can get busy at this particular place, so call ahead if your hungered. Take it easy capriotti's won't be going anywhere with it's great tasting sandwiches.

The desserts they offer is mediocre, I can get a similar cake at a liquor store. 

I got the Chicken cheese steak with mushrooms, other times I get the regular cheese steak. The Cran - slam club is an experience worth eating for, a sandwich that's out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I will NEVER go to this Capriottis location again!
I own a business down the street from this location and my employees, including myself, love Capriottis sandwiches! We have eaten here a number of times over the past few years but I am so dissatisfied with their current management & team lately that I will not go back. 
We have had our sandwiches completely wrong the last 3 times I've ordered from here with the hopes that each time they will get it right! NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OBVIOUSLY!
I know I sound picky but I am not... When I say our sandwiches have been wrong I mean I order without onion & instead it comes smothered in them, I ask for mayo but get mustard... Seems as if they do it on purpose! 
The last straw was today I ordered 2 hot sandwiches and by the time they were opened (5-10 minutes after) they were so soggy and wet that I have no clue where all the liquid came from!"}
{"text":"Editing this review because a new person answered the phone today, Tyler! Great customer service, I wasn't on the phone any longer than I should have been either! Thanks Tyler ! 2/8/18  5Pm


I feel like the owner or manager is at fault for this location. It's beautiful, convenient, and good food
BUT
I called ahead, \"15 minutes\"
Got there 20 minutes later, waiting ten 

I am the general manager of a large scale restaurant and I understand that times get busy, but its knowing how to be successful.
They are sandwiches, not some abstract creation....

I called again today and ask to order pick up.. \"SILENCE\" .. hello??? \"Yes hang on logging in\" 
Okay I don't need to know that, how about you respond to me and say, okay just one moment.
Customer service seems to be great from the young staff here, but maybe someone else should take care of the expo line and phone orders"}
{"text":"I had ordered The Bobby through door dash and let me tell you how horrible this sandwich really was. The bread was stale and hard to chew, the turkey meat tasted as if it were canned meat I am absolutely disgusted with the fishy flavor it had. There was little to no mayo which made the sandwich even drier. 2/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Vegas period. Stay away if your trying to eat healthy but when I cheat which is once in a while this is one of the places I go to. The Bobbi is famous for a reason. Probably one of the best sandwiches I ever had. Been to Philly so I know what a good authentic cheese steak taste like. When I first moved out here I tried a lot of places but none came close. Capriottis is the closest that I've found. Very good and they give you a lot of meat."}
{"text":"I was really bummed that they could not make adjustments within my large catering order to provide a vegetarian option for one person.

There are 4 large subs in one large party platter. I had wanted a single portion of the vegetarian option but I was told I would have to make one entire sub vegetarian. That would mean 25% of the platter would be vegetarian. That didn't work for me."}
{"text":"Some time had passed since my bad experience I had so I decided to give Capriottis another try. 

The experience was the same as last time. Can you say deja vu? 

The food order was wrong, it was difficult to get them to correct, less than apologetic staff, exact repeat of my past experience."}
{"text":"The worst service we've ever gotten. No go, how are you. Just can I take your order. They couldn't even get our order right. We left hungry and won't be back. The manager was here and made no effort to make things right."}
{"text":"I placed an order online, chicken cheesteak and tuna hoagie. Get confirmation email. Husband goes there. They didn't get the online order. He orders in person. As he pays they receive the online order. ???
He comes home with the food. Tuna is good. No complaints there. The chicken cheese steak was soooo salty it was inedible. It also looked weird and brown...not how it usually looks. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Wow...if you dig Earl's, then you gotta try out this place 24/7 but off the strip. But very worth it...Super stuffed with meats and offer some nice hot style sandwiches like Phillips steaks and meatball marinara. Their thanksgiving sandwich...still good the next day. 20 inches can feed easily 4 ppl and for a great price. Definitely coming back when I'm in vegas again."}
{"text":"The owner called to apologize and he personally talked to his employees. Thank you for caring and fixing the issue. Mistakes happen."}
{"text":"I almost feel bad giving them so few stars but I have to. And please note I am not one of those people who only write a review when its bad. I was starving and craving a salad and thought this would be a safe bet on a good salad. They took my order quickly and efficiently, no wait. I ordered the Black & Blue salad. Before I was even done filling up my ice tea my salad was ready, at first I thought WOW thats great service! Well its probably because they must have salads pre made in the back. This salad was one of the worst salads Ive had. I could get a pre made salad from Fry's and have better. No lie. I ended up picking out the pieces of blue cheese and eating that and thats it. It had some type of meat on it that was gross. Maybe they should stick with sandwiches. But Im afraid to try one now!
On a plus side...my Doritos were good. 
And they have a nice variety of iced tea"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Capriotti's location based on the fact that they are open 24/7. 
Sometimes my daughter and I want to eat sandwich late at night. So this location comes to my mind immediately.
The only concern is that it can be very busy sometimes, due to their popularity around the Hard Rock Hotel. Because of that, tables can be very messy ...
Anyway, my favorite item is their Capistrami sandwich. Hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and coleslaw. Never ever disappointed me!
Ordering is very simple. Pay after received the food.
\"Beer Money\" is always appreciated and a loud \"thank you\" following afterward.

Noticed lot of changes on the menu. Now serving a combination of soup and salad, soup and 1/2 sandwich, salad and 1/2 sandwich  ... didn't try it yet. Maybe some other time when I'm not hungry enough to eat a whole sandwich.
Also, the Eggplant Parmigiana sandwich is no longer on the menu. I really miss this one! That was my favorite when I didn't want to eat any meat. 
I wish they bring it back, but I highly doubt it. According to their employees, the Eggplant is off from their menu a long time ago!"}
{"text":"Quick & Awesome 

Ordered the \"Bobby\". This is basically thanksgiving on a bun. Turkey, cranberry sauce & stuffing. Bread is soft and compliments the sandwhiches well.    Amazing! 

Menu is pretty simple. Salads & sanwhiches, potato chips at the counter. You have the option of Small (9\"), Medium  (12\") & Large (20\"). Ordered my food and had it in hand before i sat down. 

All together inly spent about $12 for a medium sanwhiche with drink. 

Will be back every time I'm  in town!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Cole Turkey with ez slaw and recieved a mess of a sandwich thrown together in about 2 mins. Horrible place, avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"Just a heads up, their online ordering system may be having some issues, and if you don't create an account to order online, your order may never go through.
It only takes 2 minutes to create an account, and it's worth it.
After eating Jimmy John's religiously, I decided to try something new that I hadn't tried before - Capriotti's. I am a sucker for Italian-style sandwiches at all kind of shops like this, so I ordered the Grilled Italian sandwich.
Delivery estimated time was 12:40, and my sandwich got here at about 1 p.m., so 20 minutes late, but hey, it got here, so I guess I can't complain too much.
Even the smallest size is HUGE! Overall, the sandwich is good. Could use some lettuce, but there is a good amount of meat and cheese to make it good. I added mayo (weird, maybe?) to add some sauciness to it, and honestly, I'm glad I did. I feel like it would've been dry without it, even with the Italian oils.
Would definitely try again!"}
{"text":"Capriottis is always a solid choice. They have great food and are consistent.  Always get the chicken cheese steak which is my favorite but also other sandwiches are great as well. Surprised they get such a low rating. It is a little pricey for what it is but it is consistent and good."}
{"text":"I'm usually the one who is asked for recommendations for restaurants. Because I travel frequently, I get to learn about and pass along to others some great hidden gems that might otherwise be overlooked.

While in Las Vegas for a work conference, a friend of mine came up to me and asked me if I had heard of Capriotti's Sandwich Shop. I hadn't, so I was intrigued. He proceeded to tell me about this place and how amazing the Bobby Sandwich was. The detail and enthusiasm in which he spoke about this sandwich and how it was Thanksgiving dinner rolled into a sandwich made me crave it so badly that I knew I would be eating here some time during my stay. 

So, that's just what I did. Leaving the Bellagio via taxi, the first stop en route to the airport was Capriotti's. I was out the door almost before the taxi stopped because I was starving (and the meter was running). I was told this was a small sandwich shop with limited seating, but it actually had more than I expected. I suspect there's a rush at lunchtime, so online ordering and carry out are both options. 

Let's talk a little bit about this sandwich. I made a rookie mistake of ordering the medium - 12 inches of turkey and stuffing goodness, but way more than I could eat. Next time I'll order the small. It came to me in a paper bag wrapped in butcher paper, and it took everything I had in me not to rip into this until I was at the airport. 

The \"grand reveal\" - when I sat down and gently took my sandwich out of the bag and unwrapped it was like opening Christmas presents.. I didn't know what it was going to look like but I wanted to find out right away. Before me sat this wonderful looking sandwich with stuffing layered between the chewy sub bun. Dollops of red streak across the stuffing showing me where the cranberry goodness was hanging out. 

I consumed the first half without dissecting it because I wanted to taste it how it was meant to be enjoyed. The turkey flavor came though in each bite along with cranberry and thyme stuffing. Something kind of tangy also hit me, and I later identified it as mayo. While this seems strange, fight the urge to ask them to hold it because it balances the favors out perfectly. 

This truly was thanksgiving on a plate and something I'm going to want again pretty soon.  The freshness of the turkey came through, and as I tore apart the second half, I was pleased to see it was real turkey... Not slices.. And there was a healthy amount. No skimping here on ingredients!

My friend, Mark, told me that he looks forward to Thanksgiving leftovers every year so he can make one of these at home, but he makes it a point to swing by at least once when he's in Vegas to pick one up.  He's made me a believer, and I'll be following in his footsteps from now on.. Making my own in November and picking them up any other time I can.

Final comment: I ate this lovely sandwich almost 24 hours ago and haven't anything else to eat yet.. And I'm still not hungry!"}
{"text":"Ordered food on the app, said 15 minuets and 40 minuets later never got my food!!! I asked how much longer and got an attitude from the employee, \"We're busy\". I said you could run this place more efficiently and get online orders placed faster then 40 minuets. The guy working said \"Because you're a regular I'll let that slide\". With a angry stare in his eyes, like he would fight me if I wasn't a regular. GUESS WHOS NOT A REGULAR ANYMORE!!!! I couldn't wait any longer I had to get back to work, without my sandwich. Thanks Capriottis for making me late to work and never getting my food done in a reasonable amount of time. 40 minuets to make a cheesesteak, really??!!??!!? No lunch for me today even though I already paid for my sandwich. I had to leave, I couldn't wait any longer. Hopefully they gave my sandwich (if they ever maid it) to a homeless person. Just as a side note, this Capriottis location is always dirty. Where is Darcy Spears when you need her. No lids on the ice tea dispenser, flat sodas most of the time, food on the floor both in dining and behind the register, trash is over flowing, and it always smells like cigarettes in this location. If you are from out of town and you never had Capriottis, please don't think all caps are like this one. I'll never go back to this location again!"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome here,fast and super friendly.i made a mistake on the order and they fixed it right away."}
{"text":"I researched the best pastrami sandwich in Las Vegas on Yelp and this was the result.  I must say the Capastrami was very delicious, definitely one of the best I've ever had.  We also tried the Bobbie per the reviews, IMO this thanksgiving tribute would have been better if it were hot, because it was cold it didn't satisfy as much as the Capastrami.  All in all I'd most def. stop by here again next time I'm in Vegas, although I'd stop here either coming from or going to the airport as this location is right off Paradise rd."}
{"text":"If you go to Vegas, you have to stop at this sandwich shop! It's freaking amazing! I don't think you can go wrong on any of the items. The reviews don't lie, this place is a solid 5 stars. Try the Bobby, it's Thanksgiving in a sandwich."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had from a fast food location. Make sure and triple check your order before you go home. I got home and found that they had totally screwed up my food. I called and rather than offer a credit they wanted me to drive all the way back there to return the item to them and then wait while they make the correction. I explained that I wouldn't be able to make the trip again tonight at which point I was told that this is my only option and they would not offer a credit. In n Out messed up my drink once. They comped me a free meal at the time and place of my choosing. Capriottis could learn a thing or two about customer service from just about any other fast food chain in existence. Only order from this capriottis if you really love being forced to make redundant trips that you don't have time for or beng stuck with something you did not want or order. BUYER BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Cute little sandwich shop behind the McDonalds on Decatur & flamingo, small but still kinda cozy, the people that work here are cool and friendly. I got a small meal (the Bobbie meal) so the price was cheap... they don't have sprite, coke, Pepsi, just Mountain Dew & 7up. They don't have any 'name brand chips' here either which isn't a big deal at all to the norm but if your a foodie like me... I like to have my variety of flavorful chips. I wanted to see what all the buzz about the Bobbie was about, I liked the combination of cranberry, stuffing, turkey, & mayo (because you can't even taste the mayo) but it honestly wasn't a wow factor. It was a good meal with okay prices, next time ill bring my hot sauce bottle. 

P.S. they don't carry avocado."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this Capriotti's for a while now because it's on my way to work on the strip, but I keep coming back because the food is always consistently good and the staff are super friendly. Also if you do their surveys you save $3 which is totally worth 1 minute of your time, who doesn't like to save a little money? Definitely stop in to this Capriotti's if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Steer clear of this location. Waited 25 minutes for a salad that was made with the wrong chicken only to find out they ran out and were hoping we wouldn't notice. Never again will I come to this location."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich spots I've ever been to... I was SERIOUSLY impressed with how good the Cheese Steak Sandwich was and that comes from someone who is NOT easily impressed...
The only reason they didn't get that 5th star was because they took a bit longer to get my order, but DEFINITELY worth the wait!"}

{"text":"Very nice sub and lots of it.

Very nice service.

Honestly, I'm at the point of \"you serve food and are making me feel less stressed rather than more so -- DO THAT THING.\"

A small sub is a substantial nine inches (that sounds dirty), which I consider to be enough for later (that sounds dirty, too)."}

You can get subs, salads and soups here, all look excellent.  Opted to go with the Cheesesteak, Capastrami and the famous \"Bobbie\", of the 3 I liked the Capasrami the best, but all were very good.

The Cheesesteak is traditional, with an option for onions, Sweet and Hot Peppers included.  Get them, makes the sandwich.

The \"Bobbie\" is basically Thanksgiving on a bun, Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Homemade Stuffing and Mayo.

The Capastrami, their take on pastrami.  This was amazing!  Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Swiss Cheese and Russian Dressing.  The flavor of the pastrami with all the other topping is rich, but sooo good.  

The have Pepsi products for their drink selection which is a plus, as well as iced tea of course.

Highly recommended, you won't be disappointed.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"OMG this was one of the best sub sandwiches I have had in a really long time!  I had the opportunity to try a few things: 1) the black and bleu salad, which I had with the cranberry dressing.  It was really delicious and just what I was looking for. I also got to try the ham and cheese and the Italian. Both were fantastic. They used some kind of seasoning...an oil and vinegar maybe...that gave the sub such wonderful flavor. I am excited to try the Bobby next time. A friend of mine got it and she was very impressed that the bread was not soggy at all because of the cranberry sauce, but another friend said the cranberry sauce was a little too sweet. Personally I don't mind a little too sweet, but if you are sensitive to it, you might want to scrape some of the cranberry off or ask them to go light.  One con: I got a cookie and while it was delicious, I am not sure it was made there, and I really am a huge fan of cookies which are made on site."}
{"text":"If you want a great sandwich in Madison, come to Capriott's, hands down. The Bobbie is basically thanksgiving on a hoagie, with awesome hand-pulled turkey, cranberry sauce and just the right amount of mayo. And the Capastrami is awesome if you're looking for something hot. Hot pastrami with russian dressing and cole slaw, perfect combination of ingredients. The bread is nothing to write home about, but very solid as well. The prices are higher than Quiznos/Subway etc., but you're paying for much higher quality ingredients. Gotta say, I miss living right down the street from this joint."}
{"text":"Great experience with Emil(sp?) and Conrad last night. Friendly service, helpful, got my app working, even found extra deal coupon on app. Food was delicious. Will be back when at Green Valley again."}
{"text":"YUMMO!  Thanks to my hubby for introducing me to this sandwich shop!  This not your ordinary sub shop!  They make their turkey and roast beef and shred it fresh!  So awesome compared to sliced meat (less sodium and preservatives this way).  I love the homemade turkey sub and my husband loves the bobby!"}
{"text":"Poor quality food, always dry and unpleasant... A lot of employees enjoy talking trash about their employer in front of customers. Sandwiches made incorrectly often. Would not recommend.

The owner has resorted to writing poor reviews for her competitors businesses, now reducing their business rating down to 1 star, in my opinion. Extremely childish."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service I waited over 30 mins for my sandwich! Ordered at 12:23 and left at 1:02!! No apology from staff, overheard the guy say we forgot Erika* everyone who ordered after me left with their food and apologies from staff for the long wait. I was left standing there alone, no one asking what my name was or what I ordered just completely ignored me. A $25 order and I was treated like I was invisible. Needless to say I won't go back."}
{"text":"Me and my co workers always go here for the best subs in Scottsdale!!! Bobbie is a killer for all of us, so good!!! Strongly recommend for anyone in the area to try them out!!! 2 Mexican girls always take care of you as well as the rest of the workers"}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in vegas by far! Bobby is so good I eat it twice a week in my dreams."}
{"text":"Very slow, but well worth the wait.  The staff is friendly and prices are reasonable.  When the food arrives it is excellent!"}
{"text":"I recently just moved back to Las Vegas and i must admit this this was the first place i hit up.  I lived in the state of WA for about 5 years and thought about this place plenty of times.  So glad to be back in Vegas, my second home (org from So. Cal).  I always get the Capastrami - soooo delish!!! The staff, they're always great peeps.

What's on the Capastrami?  Well..  Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw all in yummy sub."}
{"text":"I'm a vegetarian so there are not too many places I go to eat. I went to this place and tried their veggie turkey sandwich. It took about two hours for the nausea and stomach pains to start. I don't know, maybe food poisoning? I bet there are not a lot of veggies eating there so maybe the soy turkey was old and bad? It's the next morning and my esophagus and stomach are on fire. I can't eat or drink anything. Ouch."}
{"text":"The cheesesteak is a tad bready and the peppers are spicy. The bbq chicken salad was good but the ranch was too mild"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I have EVER had! Very tasty and love the generous portions. My favorite is The Bobby... it's like Thanksgiving whenever I want! =)"}
{"text":"Bunch of incompetent employees. Ordered on DoorDash and an hour later when the doordash runner arrives for pick up they tell him they are out of bread. You would think the manager could have easily called doordash or myself upon receipt of the order to advise of such but he claims he was \"busy\". How busy could a sandwich shop with no bread be? I guess he was too busy and overwhelmed to tell people \"I'm sorry we are out of bread\" AND make a 20 second phone call in the span of an hour. When I called to express my frustration the manager blatantly ignored me and claimed he was so busy it was too much to take my phone call as he was \"just trying to make it through the day\". Poor kid, what a tough job. Patiently awaiting his managers phone call as promised.

PS: there is a reason this location is less than the normal 4 stars! All negative reviews regarding service!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's Sandwich Shop in Madison, WI

This place was nice. I went in to order a sandwich for my fiance while he waited outside. I thought it would be really quick but there were about 3-4 people in front of me--2 were waiting for their food and 1 or 2 had not yet ordered. Unfortunately, there was only 1 person working that day so things were moving pretty slow. He was making subs, trying to take orders and receive payment, and at one point the phone rang. He had to let it go to voicemail because he was just slammed. You can see the kitchen from behind the counter so I could tell he was just trying to keep up. Despite all this, he was well mannered, polite, and patient with me when I did not know what I was ordering. I gave this place a higher score simply because of the service I received from this young man. He was super sweet!

When I got my food, I would say I waited for about 15-20 minutes.I would say this place is nice if you are looking for a quick-ish (but not too quick) bite to eat. If they would hire more staff I would attend this place more often, but I just do not have that sort of time especially since I can go down the street and get something quicker. 

The food was good. It wasn't my sub, but obviously I tasted it. Nothing that will blow you out of the water. I ordered the Capistromi, which is a sub with pastrami, swiss cheese, thousand island dressing, and lettuce. I did like that they loaded a lot of meat on the sub... so that it a plus in my book."}
{"text":"Excellent food! I used to order from here regularly but recently stopped due to a sudden delivery fee. Its good but not that good!"}
{"text":"First time eating here and I wasn't too impressed. I told the person working the register that it was my first time there as I was looking over the menu. She was very helpful and told me what the top sellers were and what her favorites were. I ordered the Italian sausage and was a bit disappointed. The sandwich was sausage with cheese and that was it. No other kind of condiments or vegetables in it. They should have told me when I ordered that it was only sausage and cheese and if I wanted anything added to it. My wife's sandwich came without any condiment either and she had to go to the counter and ask for mayonnaise. The meal was not that great but might have been pretty good with something other than cheese with it."}
{"text":"I am surprised about the low star reviews for this place but I can also understand this. The sandwiches a wonderful, I always get the capastrami and the Bobby. The service is somewhat perfunctory which is why I can see this place having low stars. The place is also somewhat dirty but I think this is just the age of the building. Bottom line good sandwiches for dining out but not eating in."}
{"text":"So I started going to this particular Capriotti's when it first opened but the last four times I've been there if it's not one thing it's another the coleslaw On the sandwich was not very good it was old I ordered a bowl of soup and it was not at all what it was supposed to be then they give me mushrooms when I didn't ask for mushrooms and then today I ordered a sandwich and it wasn't what it was supposed to be I think I'm done I think it's because  it's a waste of time and money"}
{"text":"After posting a negative review about the salads lacking the manager contacted me, apologized and gave me free sandwich coupons to give them another try! That was very cool! This time the salad came with a little more meat (although still could use more for the cost of the salad) and my husband's capistrami was great!"}
{"text":"Stay away... they are making your food and not washing there hands.  Only two people in the store working over worked and trying to take orders from the grill that means you need to YELL not good.  Then the chick come to the conter and ask what do you won't that twice.  She has a cell phone in one hand and a work phone in the other she takes both calls.  Then she asks me so what do you won't with a nasty tone, thats three times. I told her all I need is a salad then I ask what do you put on it she was speaking so fast because she is over worked and got to get back to making sandwiches I did not understand what language she was speaking at that point she was so mad at me for asking her to repeat the topping part she just had a melt down, I told her forget it you will never make me a sandwich with those fitly hands and went to Micky D's where there are so many workers they are running into each other.

I put this review up three time but it keeps disappearing!"}
{"text":"Stopped buy it was 1:30 on a Saturday no line I thought it would be quick. Only two people in the back cooking a guy and a chick. The chick yelled from the grill what can I get you I did not fill like yealling or repeating so I told her my oder from across the room and she got it all wrong  I told her a italian salad not a large sandwich she was mad she said is that all hold on... she had two phones one in each dirty hand then she came back and said so what do you need for the third time I told her a salad then she gave me a total.  I asked what type of dressing do you have she said something fast in a neuter type of Spanish I asked if she could repeat that then she got nasty with it and spoke i said ITALIAN!... I told her to stop wright there bitch you will never get to put those dirty hands on my food and walled out the door.  These people are not clean no gloves picking up dirty phones and rude as shit ...... don't go to this one."}
{"text":"Sandwich was decent. Location was really tucked away and slightly hard to find. The guy who took my order was extremely helpful, but the girl who worked there seemed to be having a rough day. I was mostly impressed because the guy worker noticed that I needed a large lid and grabbed one for me without me having to ask. It's nice to see good service. The reason for 3 stars is because the dining area wasn't very inviting, and needs an update."}
{"text":"Where is this owner or manager?????  Please show some pride!
I have to say that growing up in DE with the original Capriottis  & a small business owner myself I am beyond disappointed.  This location is a crap hole and that's being nice!  I keep going back hoping they get their stuff together. It's getting worse. 
It's FILTHY!!!!!!
I wish I had my phone to take pictures. The kitchen area was disgusting w food and trash all over. Counter and guest tables not wiped in a long time. Soda machines and trash area yuck!!! 
Sandwiches were a sad representation of Capriottis. 3 slices of meat on an Italian. 
Employees were sitting in back texting.  Order was slow and wrong.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed that they forgot AGAIN my ingredients. No vinegar, oil, peppers, onions. This is the 2nd time it's happened and it's been both places on Sahara. This was my favorite sandwich shop but it's looking like not anymore."}
{"text":"meh.

was excited after all the great reviews!

i got the steak sandwich. good sized. but not much flavor. bread was chewy and a little stale.

my wife got the cole turkey. it sure tasted good! she was nauseated the rest of the night, which was no fun. dont know if the coleslaw or russian dressing was spoiled. or maybe the turkey.

customer service terrible. we got there around 5p. they were nearly out of all the various bread choices. the folks working there really didnt know what the were doing. one customer wanted a steak sandwich, but they were out of rolls. he asked if they could do it on regular bread. AND THEY SAID NO! seriously? take the steak, put it between two slices of bread, and get the guy a steak sandwich! wow. 

here is the box. no one behind the counter could get outside of the box.

i wouldn't go back. sorry."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! Joey was very helpful and friendly. We told him we were from out of town and he made us feel very welcomed. He even gave us a yummy chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"Great place! I wish there was one just like it in San Diego. Fresh ingredients and they had the option to build your own sandwich or salad (excellent for picky eaters like me). The bobby sandwich (roasted turkey, cranberry and stuffing) was very reasonably priced and really good sized! Two people could share it and leave with a full tummy. 

I ordered a salad with slow roasted hand pulled turkey and the most delicious cranberry vinaigrette dressing I have ever had. It came in a little packet, but I was happy to find actual cranberry pieces in there, and it was soy free (hard to find in salad dressings!). 

The person taking our order was really friendly and happy to let us have a taste of the ingredients prior to adding them to the salad. Try it out, you'll be glad you did! We were :-)"}
{"text":"First off, I normally love Capriotti's but this location sucks. Every single employee here is completely lost with their head up their asses. I have mistakenly ordered online for pick up twice now and have been left waiting both times because they couldn't find my order. Both times I was told it would be done in less than 2 minuets. 10 minuets later I'm finally walking out after 5 minuets spent watching the employees argue about who's going to make my sandwich, trying to find my order and walking around like zombies. There is one reason I order online, I don't want to have to wait. You have let me down the last time, I will never be back to this location."}
{"text":"A friend I grew up with, back east, now lives in Vegas, and urged me to check out Capriotti's, when she saw they opened in Mesa. Glad I did! I enjoyed the Grilled Italian sandwich, and was pretty much blown away by the incredible amounts of delicious, Italian meats that were used, on this huge sandwich, bursting with flavor. One of my dining companions ordered the Chopped Italian Salad.. the meats olives, and chick peas were a nice touch, but the lettuce was kinda meh looking, and they don't offer much in the way of choices, for salad dressings.  I would absolutely stick with the sandwiches.... Great meat, great cheese, great bread, great peppers.. a great east coast sandwich, and I can't wait to try more stuff here!"}
{"text":"So disgusted with the service and the sandwich. Barely any toppings and bread was old. Loads of mayo to make up for the lack of toppings. Employees are RUDE and clearly unhappy to work here. May be because of the big dude with the tattoos who is either the owner or manager who was yelling at them in front of us customers. I would not want to be there either. Very unprofessional. They need to learn from the Warm Springs and Eastern location on how to make a good sandwich and provide better service. The whole experience here was terrible. Do not waste your money here."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches. I have found it is best to phone in the order and pick it up as ordering on the spot results in a 15 minute wait but I've never been disappointed with the quality of their food. The bundit dessert cakes are really expensive which kinda sucks because they taste great."}
{"text":"I HATE THIS LOCATION! tried to call in my order today, sat on hold for 10 minutes, decided to drive down there. There was one customer in the whole place (also waiting). when we walked in,  they immediately told us we have to wait (well of course,  right) understaffed??? We  asked for extra mayonnaise on our bobbie and I swear they forgot the mayonnaise  all together, then they tried to give us the other guy who was waitings sandwich??? confused ?? This location also doesn't have Bundt Cakes Terrible service and sad bobbies with no mayonnaise."}
{"text":"Love the bobbie, it tends to be a little dry so get it with xtra mayo. The bundt cakes are yummy, but the chips are generic and meh...they should get some yummy chips in there like \"dirty\" chips!"}
{"text":"I visit this location at least once a month. Not the best caps in vegas but could be worse. The sandwiches usually come out slow. The average time I wait is about 15-20min. Now the sandwhiches are alright they are unusually dryer than most caps sandwiches but nothing to extreme. I would visit this location however not anytime soon. Upon my visit today the health inspector paid this location a surprise visit due to a complaint. Not sure what it was but seemed pretty legit. She immediately had issues with their sink. Not thinking anything of it ate my meal. However I am paying for it now. Thanks Caps! I'll think twice next time"}
{"text":"Great service. Great sandwiches. My husband is hooked on the Bobbie (Thanksgiving in a bun) and I've enjoyed their Black & Bleu salads."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up. 
We had a training close by and we found this little shop. It's small but the sandwiches are huge! 
The meatball sandwich is to die for! 
The turkey is amazing as well! 
Not too expensive either, I highly recommend it! 
Also; the employees are super nice."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying capriottis. Every time I asked a local where to get a good sandwich I was directed here. I walked in and was greeted by an employee. He knows his customers because he could tell I hadn't been there from the look I was giving the menu. He helped me decide on a sandwich and sent my order through. We carried on casual conversation while my meal was being prepared. There was no one else in the restaurant so it made waiting for my food and enjoyable experience. Soon enough my freshly made sandwich was handed to me by an equally nice employee. I thanked them and they wished me a great rest of the day. 

The sandwich definitely put subway to shame. If I want another sub sandwich I may just have to go back and visit these guys. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"My past experiences with this Capriotti's off Warm Springs was very disappointing. First time, I came in, ordered my sandwich, and was at the register to pay when a call-in order was handed to the cashier so I was pushed aside so the call-in order person was taken care of. Not very customer service oriented. I received a survey for $3 off coupon and thought that could salvage what happened to me the first time...so I went there again to redeem my coupon...the cashier scanned my receipt, had to call this girl from the back and she looked at my receipt like it was a foreign object and said, it had to be redeemed within 24 hours. I was like are you serious? I just got the code and it says it is valid for 30 days after purchase which was like last week...but she walked off and the cashier just apologized...there were a lot of people waiting so I just paid for my sandwich and left...I looked at my receipt and it says in big bold letters, valid for 30 days after purchase and what the cashier was scanning was for CAPAddicts Rewards...this location really needs to hire people who can read and actually process receipts! Not going back to this location ever again."}
{"text":"So glad place is so close and love the drive up window also all the workers are so nice"}
{"text":"Actually SUPER impressed by this place! While they do close quite early on Sundays (and one time they ran out of bread so I was sorely disappointed...), I think this place is definitely worth a visit. 

The sandwiches smell great and I think you can tell that they'll taste great before you even put them in your mouth. They have some cool specialty sandwiches (such as their famous Thanksgiving themed one), but their philly cheesesteak is also pretty good! 

The sandwiches are pretty big and well worth their price. If you're in the area, I would definitely stop by and give this place a shot. There's a reason they've been around for so long!"}
{"text":"Sorry but the sandwiches are just below average. Tried the philly and was disappointed. Unseasoned me covered in plain cheese. The Ac didn't work so I sat there eating my sandwich in an empty restaurant sweating my but off."}
{"text":"We were so excited when Capriottis came to our neighborhood! We get them any time we are nearby one, so how perfect that they are 2 minutes away now. But too bad they CANNOT make a sandwich the way it was ordered. Four times, FOUR, we have gone and each time they have totally screwed up. We take them to go and when we get home and open it up, it's the biggest disappointment. We only order the spicy Italian with peppers and mayo. That's it! Nothing too crazy or complicated. Yet every time it isn't right. Twice we have come home with just a regular Italian sandwich, once we came home with a spicy Italian without the peppers or mayo, and the last time we came home with a Philly! A freakin philly! I called them and told them about it and they said to come back they had it waiting for us. So my husband brought the philly with him just to show we weren't lying and they gave him the Italian and wanted the philly back! Mind you, this Philly has already come home with us, opened it up and everything. I really hope they didn't give it to the person who really ordered it. But they should have let my husband keep it for our trouble. Anyway, so he brings home the spicy Italian sandwich and guess what? It was a plain Italian with not even oil on it. That was the last straw. We will not be wasting our money there anymore. Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I was craving a hoagie so I ordered a cold Italian with hot peppers and pickles for pick up. As I tried to get it, I had no idea this sandwich shop was actually inside Red Rock Casino. When I called, the gentleman that answered was super helpful by telling me where to park and the fastest way to get there. When I heard this was in a casino, I had this thought like \"oh no, a food court sub... this will probably suck.\" I was so pleasantly surprised! I haven't had an Italian sub this good since I lived in eastern PA. The meats were good quality and the bread was amazing!! I'd prefer shredded lettuce to chopped but everything else was on point. And I have to say it again... dat bread doe....."}
{"text":"I should have read the ratings on this branch before even ordering.   I didn't do it because I thought  they are a chain, everything would be okay.
I did an online order.  Everything went well and got my confirmation.  For some reason I asked me son to pick up the order which was originally for 7:15pm.  I had called a couple of hours earlier to say I would pick it up at 7:30pm instead.  I could sense the lady that answered me said yes I could without even verifying who I was.  The only info I gave her was the original pick up time.  Long story short my son went in 40 minutes before to ask if they can deliver and guess what they could not find my order.  I have to send all the email and receipt confirmation to my son.   He told them they have 30 minutes to do it and the girl he was talking to got rattled and gave an excuse that they had no manager around.  Luckily they were able to produce the order.  I had guests I was serving and the Cheese steak was an embarrassment.   I ordered for them to put mushrooms and fried onions in it.  BOth were not in it plus the cheese they placed was I think one small piece.   You can tell it was hurriedly done.  The Bobbie was a bit better.  But I swear I have eaten a tastier one before.   THis was supposed to be their popular item.

It completely turned me off"}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop. They always make a great sandwich. For a while the sandwiches seemed to be getting lighter on the meats but I think they got the memo and are turning it around."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwich shop, amazing people, and amazing food! I came in today and was greeted by Doug, who helped me learn to use the app. He took my order of my medium Bobby with xtra cranberry (yum!). We were messing with the app, and found a free drink and chip from my last visit. 

The app is so sweet, you'll get a free sandwich after 9 visits. I'm on my way there haha. 

I highly recommend the Bobby. It was the first thing I tried when I moved out here, and I literally ate it for a week straight. These guys make killer sandwiches & always make you feel welcome. 

Can't wait to see them again!! Thanks Doug & the rest of the crew for always serving Vegas with the best!"}
{"text":"Some good stuff. We were visiting Red Rock and decided to try this place. I remember the bread was soft and good flavors."}
{"text":"Pretty decent Capriotti's. So glad to have more & more options in this burgeoning area of Henderson! I love the Capistrami Sandwich. But alas, it gives me heartburn like a m*ther! So...my next fav is The Bobbie. Who doesn't like a little reminder of Thansksgiving leftovers in a sandwich every once in a while? :) The staff seems to be mostly HS students @ after school jobs? And they are usu pleasant & appreciative of a tip, which is nice. My dad loves their Meatballs. Although I am partial to my own homemade recipe! Lol! & my son used to like their take on Philly's? But the last few times we've ordered he's been convinced there are mushrooms in his sandwich. And he hates mushrooms. So now he won't indulge @ Capriotti's w/me...anyway, overall a solid Cap's. Please keep up the good work! :)"}
{"text":"The wait is ridiculous! And compared to the others in town this one STINKS. And would NOT honor the VIP Free sandwich card. NO-ONE in the place looked happy. Customers were stating this is my last time here too. SAD SAD, cause they are usually good. Sahara store is worth the trip! ALWAYS GOOD THERE!"}
{"text":"The food was nasty it was dry they were all hanging out in the back and had a new person that was a training come and take my order and he didn't even know the menu everything was just  all bad if I can give zero stars I would food was so bad coworkers were out buying food from other places bringing it in to EAT never again"}
{"text":"There is an art to making a sandwich. Italian sub with all the fixings is the bomb! Great rolls!"}
{"text":"The sub was great, except for the cornmeal all over the top which tended to grate the lips like sandpaper. All of the chips were at or past expiration date, which made me question the freshness of their food otherwise. Service was above average, and cleanliness was average/slightly below. Didn't appreciate when someone mopped with extremely smelly cleanser near me while I was eating. The place has a pervading fish odor. It's not strong, but it's odd."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Waited 20 minutes for 2 cold sandwiches. Everyone that ordered after us got their sandwiches and left before us. So awful!!"}
{"text":"Not satisfied with this place. 
I ordered a roast beef with cole slaw. The sandwich was packed with slaw and a very small amount of SHREDDED roast beef with some weird cheese sauce.  Roast beef should be sliced, not shredded. 
The over all taste was not bad, but given the price and appearance of the place I expected the food to be more then it was. 
I will return 1 more time to try the turkey & cranberry. That will be the deciding factor."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this gem due to finding an Indian restaurant for my traditional grandparents that can't digest anything non traditional. I have developed an aversion to Indian food, due to the constant need to find different locales that offer this culinary delight to my grandparent's pleasure. So, when I saw a sandwich shop, I decided to buy a sandwich along with my mother and my aunt. Whenever I frequent Subway, I always order a foot long, due to my voracious and manly appetite. However, you get more than you bargain for and a small is the only size I could envision myself digesting! It's H-U-G-E! And mmm it was delicious :) My taste buds are singing in a symphony of joy when I envision it...I'm going to jump in the car and GO RIGHT NOW!"}
{"text":"Thursday night football my boyfriend stops into Capriottis inside the Aliante to pick up a homemade turkey sub for the family.  As I bit into my sandwich, I nearly cracked my tooth on a huge turkey bone!   I called to speak with Manager and a lady picked up and left me on hold for 12 minutes and never came back!  I will be calling again and letting corporate know how disappointed I am in the quality of the sandwich and the terrible customer service!"}
{"text":"First time at this chain. In town for work. Asked what's popular, Abigail said, The Bobbie. Got it, and I love it. I love the mayo with the cranberry sauce. Goes surprisingly well. Free drink thanks to yelp. I would eat again but only in a to-go situation. 

First, I needed to use the bathroom, and hadn't read other reviews, just saw the stars. Now I can hold it, no biggie. I still want to eat here and can understand places this small not having a public restroom.  Lastly, if you do not have a public restroom, please have a hand sanitizer station or something to make customers feel comfortable. I came straight from work and I have been shaking people's hands and touching stuff all day. I like clean hands before touching my sandwich. 

I will be back here before next Wednesday, the Bobbie was that good! Just please have something to wash hands in place before then. If you do, I will bump this rating up. 

Thank you!"}
{"text":"If I were rating based simply on taste of the food, I would be rating a four, but, unfortunately, that's not the case.  Yes, the food is good, particularly the steak and cheese and the Capistrami.  However, the subs seem to be getting smaller every time I order.  I am a 5'2 girl.  I can't come close to eating a 9\" sub anywhere else, but I did today.  The sub rolls may be 9\" long, but they aren't even 3\" wide!  I could probably even overlook that, though, if the service was better.  Every time I've been in the actual store, the people behind the counter always seem more interested in talking to each other rather than taking care of the customers.  I haven't been in there in a while, so maybe that's changed, but that was the case on more than one occasion.  My delivery service today, however, was atrocious.  It took over an hour and a half, and I live less than 1/2 mile from the store.  I called after almost an hour and was told that the delivery guy had left 20 minutes ago.  Then I called another 20 minutes later and spoke to the manager.  He would barely let me finish a sentence and kept just saying that there was only one driver and they had a lot of orders.  If I'd been told when I ordered that it would be a long wait, that would have been one thing.  But I was told it would take 40 minutes, and it took over twice that amount of time.  He offered me a free sandwich next time, but that really doesn't make up for such poor customer service."}
{"text":"Turkey sandwich is sooooo delicious! I love this place. Not bad for it being next to a gas station! The guy helping us out was really nice too!"}
{"text":"I met my husband here for lunch and it was delicious! The service was quick too. The interior was nothing special but we were just there to eat quickly and get back to work so that was no big deal. I had The Bobbie and it was fantastic, I highly recommend it and kind of want one right now..."}
{"text":"This is a most stop if you are ever in Vegas.  By far my favorite sandwich shop anywhere.  If they opened one up in Chicago I would move in for at least a week.   My favorite sandwich is the  Slaw Be Joe sandwich, which is made with roast beef.  It  isn't roast beef cold cuts, but real shredded roast beef and its amazing.  The sandwich comes with cole slaw, cheese and Russian dressing.  They also have another sandwich made with shredded turkey, cranberry sauce and stuffing.  It's lunch and dinner all in one sandwich.  Oh man just writing about it has me craving one.  If anyone is stopping in Vegas please feel free to bring me back a sandwich."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I used the check-in feature on yelp and was eligible for a free cookie or a brownie. The man at the register said I would have to go home and print it out in order to get my free reward even though the yelp app said to show the phone to the person at the register."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is a classic sandwich shop that comes out of Las Vegas.

I usually order the Bobbie, which tastes like Thanksgiving! It is one of their most known sandwiches. The Bobby consists of turkey, cranberry sauce, homemade stuffing, and mayo.

Delicious and quick sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Another great Capriotti's store.

During this visit I got a cheese steak with extra onions, mushrooms, and I added cole slaw. There have been times where I ordered the extra mushrooms at other stores and I end up not getting it. This wasn't one of those times. Mushrooms were all over the place and in every bite I took. This was probably the best cheese steak I have gotten at a Capriotti's in recent memory.

Also at this store, since I ate inside, my food came on a plate. It was a nice touch just being able to dig right in instead of ripping apart all of the paper like I normally would.

I don't know if they plan on doing this all of the time or just because they recently opened, but there were employees walking around checking up on everyone, asking how their meal was, clearing plates,  and offering to refill sodas. 

The food was excellent as usual, and there was a extra dose of good customer service. I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"One of my go to sandwich franchises, and one of my preferred capriotti's stores, I can always depend on this location to make a good sandwich.

With all the different sandwiches available, it can sometimes be hard to make a decision. Their cheese steak, turkey, italian, capastrami and bobbie are some of my regular favorites.

Sometimes this location's wait time can be long and the cheese steak can be dry, but other than that the quality of their sandwiches are consistently top notch, and the employees their are always friendly."}
{"text":"NASTY!!!! If you're looking to get sick, this is the place. Both times I went in and the sanitary precautions are not used here. I saw the cashier take money then walk over and make a sandwich.... No gloves, didn't wash his hands. Just today, another guy was coming his hair by the lettuce... WTH?!?! Never will I go back to this location. I will be contacting the health department!"}
{"text":"Great service every time, I eat here at least once a week and they never disappoint. Make sure to download the app and check in to get your free sub after X amount of visits!!!"}
{"text":"Ummmm my most favorite sandwich is the Caprastrami...the employees are super friendly and awesome. (Matty is alright too )."}
{"text":"Food is exceptional as usual...and one of my favorite lunch spots..but just received the rudest customer service experiences ever at this location...I will still frequent other locations but this one definitely lost my business.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"I went to college at the University of Delaware, Delaware being the home of Capriotti's of course, and had enjoyed it a time or two there. So when my boyfriend told me that him and some friends had gone to a sandwich place called Capriotti's out here for lunch I said to myself, \"Could it be?\". It is!! It is!!! The very same one!! Bobbies and all!!! Oh happy day!!!! Randomly they have a couple of west coast locations, one of which happens to be 2 miles from my house, and for having the foresight to put that there, I thank them! In college, my roommate and I always vowed that one day, we would pool our money and split a Bobby. Tragically, it was always out of our 52 cent Ramen Noodle price range, so that dream never came true, until now. Although my lovely roomie of 3 1/2 years is not here to share it with me, I got to have that Bobby, and OH was it worth waiting for. Fresh, delicious rolls, real roasted turkey, not that sliced stuff my friends, just like mama makes, and stuffing and cranberry to top it all off. I'm a happy girl! If I didn't have Thanksgiving plans, I'd probably just get myself a Bobby and call it a day. The people are always friendly and the sandwiches are a little more than $5 for a foot-long, but OHHH SOOO worth it!! After reading all these reviews about the cheese steak, I'm excited to try that now, but it will take a lot of willpower to NOT order the Bobby."}
{"text":"Went to this location after shopping at mall.
Capriotti's is certainly consistent.  And the uniqueness of their Bobbi gets them more interest - however ... 
We were first introduced to Capriotti's in 1997 at their Buffalo/Cheyenne location.  Been back there once
Over the years they seem to have become more like a McDonalds of Gourmet Sandwich shops .. 
Dont care for the tip jar nor the comment by cashier when a tip goes in.
Husband enjoyed his Italian .. I got a salad - Roast Beef was chewy and tough and I asked for no peppers - they actually put extra instead.
Sorry Capriottis - no more than 2 star for us."}
{"text":"Horrible, over cooked dry sandwich even when I ordered extra sauce . Stay away far away the overpriced bread sandwiches are not worth it. I would give a 0 but yelp won't let me. Garbage food, shitty service"}
{"text":"One of the few restaurants I miss while living in Seattle is Capriotti's.  A good sub sandwich place is not always easy to find.  Needless to say, I made the trip to Cap's while I was back during the holidays.  

One of the great things about this location is that being in a casino is provides you with a great food option while drinking/gambling.  

There probably isn't too much detail needed here, as most reviews are already going to give you the details on sandwich options.  

Bottom line: if you're at GVR or planning to head that way, this is probably the best/cheapest food option."}
{"text":"Great location. The people here are all super nice. If you haven't had the Veggie cheesesteak, do yourself a favor and try it. Just as good as the regular cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday while I got off from work, their was a few people ahead of me, both parties had their orders done wrong and while I was waiting in line after 15 mins and the line grew bigger I said I want to place an order, she told me I have to go in the front of the store to place the order. I waited 15 mins for the lady to fix peoples orders, and the line grew bigger and she had the nerve to tell me that? I walked right out. I was more embarrassed then anything as well. I heard people even wispering on how i stood their for that long to be told to go in the back of the line. So rude, she could have kindly still took my order and take it too the front line cooks as she did with 2 parties in front of me.  I will never go their again. All other Capriotti's will still take the order where ever you go inside the store."}
{"text":"I've been there a few times and usually things are fine. This time I went in on a Sunday at exactly 6. They refused to serve me because they close at 6. I feel this is bad practice and they should have locked their door if they weren't accepting anymore orders. It wouldn't have killed them to serve one more customer. It is very bad customer service to turn customers away!!!!"}
{"text":"My friend Mary took me here within minutes of picking me up at the airport... and from then on, I knew my vacation to Vegas would be amazing.  Capriotti's serves these HUGE mongous sandwiches, and we ordered a large (20\"!!!) Bobbie, which has to be honestly one of the best sandwiches I've eaten.  I love myself some thanksgiving, so having it in sandwich form makes me a happy boy.  The cranberry sauce and stuffing are too good to pass up.

I wish that there were Capriotti's locations in New York - the closest would be in the Philadelphia/Wilmington area (Delaware) mostly.  It honestly would be a hit here."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! We stayed at the Santa Fe casino for 2 nights and 1 1/2 days and we ate there 3 times! I couldn't get enough. We tried the Bobbie, cheese steak, and meatball and all were equally as delicious but I would have to say the cheese steak was the favorite! The man making the sandwiches obviously loved his job and took so much pride in every one that be made. When I told him how great his sandwiches were I believe he was shocked for the compliment but I could eat those everyday how could I not thank him! And the manager Mary was so sweet and helpful I really enjoyed all 3 of my experiences there and look forward to finding one close to home to share with the rest of my friends and family."}
{"text":"Big sandwiches.  Big.

Bread is great on a good day and fair when they don't have it fresh.

Mom loves the Philly cheese-steak.

I like the Italian.  I always ask for hot peppers.

Ordering and paying can be a bit confusing.  Best thing to do is to order and immediately go to the cash register to pay.  Otherwise you have your sandwich, you're hungry and then you have to go pay.  I'm not sure how they don\"t get ripped off.  It would seem to me it would be easy to order, wait, take and leave. 

The chips they offer, name escaping me now, are very good.  I know that at most sandwich places I do not get chips but here I do.  BBQ is my favorite here."}
{"text":"The Bobbie is to die for I could eat it everyday!  The manager gave us a great deal on our holiday tray because he recognized my name from Facebook!"}
{"text":"Love the sandwiches here. Never had a bad one. Now every time I eat the turkey, cranberry, stuffing one I get the shits. Still order it 9/10 times. Love it!"}
{"text":"Had the Grilled Italian with hot peppers. Sandwich was delicious, I like spicy but my mouth was on fire and a single bottle of water wasn't enough. The only thing I don't like about this place is drink situation sucks. Is it too much to have a drink dispenser or iced tea? My wife had just a regular turkey sandwich and it was delicious with real pieces of turkey. Can't wait to try something new on menu."}
{"text":"Love Capriottis! I tried the philly, bobbie, capastrami, cole turkey and etc... And love how everything taste"}
{"text":"Small sandwiches are always big enough for two. Nice location but the eat-in scenery is not cozy, but seems small.  I only get take-out from here."}
{"text":"I came here today because I was in the area, and figured it was time to try some Capriotti's. It was my first time eating their sandwiches, so I figured, what the heck, I'll give them a shot.

The menu has tons of options, and they have a few different sized subs, 9 inches being the smallest.  That's pretty darned big!  I went with a 9 inch Slaw Be Jo, and it came with meat, Russian dressing, coleslaw, mayo and roast beef.  The sandwich itself was okay, but I felt like it was missing something..it tasted kind of dry. I wanted to ask for more dressing, but after about getting half way through, I figured decided not to. I think the sandwich needs to come with some kind of dressing, prefereably Italian. It came across as somewhat dry.

Overall, prices were a okay.  $6.99 for the sandwich, $1.59 for drinks plus some tax, and the total was $9.35.  Not bad. I will say I wasn't impressed overall, but it wasn't the worst sandwich I had.  I feel like there's other sandwich shops in the area that serve similar but better sandwiches that might be worth trying before hitting up this place."}
{"text":"I found this place by accident, and I have to say, its a good sub shop.  When you walk in, its not a giant place.  Indoor seating only, and they have a super duper high wall between you and the guys making your sandwich.  For short people like me, its a little intimidating.

Like the size of this place, the menu is not huge.  They have quite a few subs to choose from, hot and cold, each coming in a variety of sizes.  9 inch, 12 inch, and I think a larger one too.  They have the traditional \"good stuff\" to choose from like roast beef, meatball and tuna subs.  Prices seem worthwhile, and I got a 9 inch roast beef sub and took home leftovers.

Great for a sub anytime, day or night.  reasonable hours and prices, and the staff seemed friendly.  Worth grabbing something to eat on a saturday afternoon, just like I did."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat when I am at the Town Square. They have amazing subs and sandwiches that are made to order and cooked and prepared quickly. My all-time favorite sub here is their Italian sub, which is made of Italian deli meats like salami capicola, and prosciuttini.  Also, another favorite was the Grilled Italian sub. Their subs come in three sizes 9\", 12\", and 20\". Prices range from sub to sub. 

Not only do they have Subs and sandwiches but they also offer salads, soups, desserts, and chips. None of which I've personally tired. Do want to note that when I was here last, they asked me if I wanted bell peppers, onions, or mushrooms and I said yes to the mushrooms not knowing that it wasn't a \"freebie\", so I was charged an extra fee for it. So, make sure to ask if it's included in the price or not. 

Staff have always been very friendly and accommodating when I needed a special order. 

This location is very small with just a few tables, so normally I would take my sub to go. Bathrooms are located at the back along with all the drink machines and condiments."}
{"text":"First time ever, trying this place out. By far, this is my favorite sandwich shop. This place is way better than subway. Meat is hot, you're choice of grilled onions and/or hot or sweet peppers. I got the cheese steak with extra cheese, onions and sweet peppers. Oh my gosh! I wanted to knack attack,a Hawaii slang for like you want to sleep after eating something so good, after I was half way through my second half of my sandwich. I ended up eating almost the whole sandwich except for like 2 more bites that was left. The workers actually bring the food to you along with a few napkins on the plate. Wish Hawaii had this place."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE SHIT!! bombass sandwiches and they have a reason why their sandwiches are vegas's best sandwiches! had pastrami and the booby and boy, were they delish! cheap and huge and amazing! it's like foodporn in your mouth! that's as good as it gets, if not, better!! will be back!"}
{"text":"Best cheese-steak sandwich in the valley. The meat was moist and tender and we added sweet peppers and fried onions. Tons of flavor! For $10.50 I got a drink and a medium sub (12\" sub). I was stuffed. Probably the small would have been enough or a large if two people are splitting. Since this was my first time in, the guy at the register answered all my questions and was very friendly. He even came over halfway through our meal to see how we liked our sandwiches. 

The place was clean and had lots of outdoor seating as well which is wonderful this time of year. They were cleaning all the tables as people came and left. They make the sandwiches right when you order them so it was hot and fresh. The bread was great as well. I will be back to try more sandwiches."}
{"text":"In my experience Capriotti's is a five star sandwich place. As much as I could ask for in a sub/salad type place, good staff, good product. My go to is the Bobby, and it's amazing, but I've even branched out to try the salads and they were quite satisfying as well. I always highly recommend Capriotti's for lunch"}
{"text":"Love the cran slam club. Great location inside Santa Fe station and also open till 2am which is a plus. Friendly service"}
{"text":"Silverado ranch location ALWAYS CONSISTENT! And the employees are always super friendly! Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Our Company gets sandwiches once  a week from this place. They are hands down , one of the best cheese steak sandwiches with \"real steak\". They load it up, and ingredients are always fresh. Don't end up at subway, quiznos, or any other crappy place in the area. End up here for lunch!"}
{"text":"Can't stop thinking of cap Loovvvvvve the capastrami more than life!!!! The dressing and slaw combo is freakin heaven. I could eat 5 a day!!#"}
{"text":"[this is re-post--another review lost to the Yelp algorithm, I suppose]

On the recommendation of Yelper Michelle T, I trekked from my South Las Vegas Blvd. hotel to get a sub at Capriotti's.  Imagine my surprise when I learned that the chain originated close to my hometown, just minutes from where my father worked for years!

I took Michelle's recommendations, got a Bobbie and a Capistrami and met my SO for lunch at the location of his conference.  Both sandwiches were great (though nothing will ever surpass the pastrami at Langer's in LA).  The Bobbie was especially fun and different, with all the elements of a good Thanksgiving meal in portable sandwich form.

I might have to check out the original back in Delaware next time I visit family. Alas, we have no Capriotti's in Colorado, so I have to travel for that sandwich goodness."}
{"text":"Always a top notch sandwich! Our family fav is The Bobbie, my personal indulgence is the Capistrami.
Consistency at its best!"}
{"text":"There's not a lot of sandwich joints that consistently blow my mind. These guys and Bay City Subs are the leaders of the pack for sure."}
{"text":"First time coming here but great customer service. Although I didn't dine in everyone was nice and not to mention the food is delicious! Highly recommend the Bobbie."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich shop. The italian sub is always amazing. I want to try some of the other subs, but the italian always calls my name. Caps is much better then potbelly and jimmy johns."}
{"text":"We had a vendor treat us to Capriottis.  OMG the Thanksgiving in a sandwich kept me full  the whole day through, certainly a meal I could only have once a year, but it's worth it. Since they brought it to us  I can't review service, or the location, I can surmise from other posts."}
{"text":"Just a normal Capriotti's. I got my favorite, the turkey sandwich with the crushed hot peppers. I feel that with this sandwich I can't go wrong.

The service wasn't anything special. Not insanely good nor bad.

I mostly rate it so high because I'm in love with their turkey and the crushed hot peppers. If you haven't had this sub TRY IT. I'm actually getting hungry just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is my favorite sub place to go in Vegas. Even though most people like the \"bobbie\" my favorite is the turkey. I get it with mayo or oil depending on my mood with cheese tomato and lettuce. I also have to get pickles and their peppers. Their peppers are amazing and spicy. My mouth is watering thinking about their pepper mix. It definitely makes the sandwich. If you're looking for a meal on the go I reccommend these subs."}
{"text":"I've been to many Capriotti's in Las Vegas and this one was basically the same as the rest. Good service, yummy food. Someone started to order before us when we were there first and the person who was taking our order told the customer to wait because we were there first. I thought that was very nice of him and showed that he valued us. 

Got the bobbie this time! I loved it but I have to admit I missed the bits of crushed pepper that comes on their regular subs. I think next time I will have to ask them to add it on top of the sub. It's just to good to not have!"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sandwich shop in Las Vegas. I love the turkey they use. It's so fresh and yummy. I usually get the turkey sandwich and add on pickles and crushed red hot peppers. The crushed red peppers make the sandwich and is my favorite part. 

If you get a sub here you must add the crushed red peppers!"}
{"text":"Their crushed red pepper is the best! If you're going to get a sub from here make sure you get it with the crushed peppers-so spicy and delicious! My favorite sub is the turkey although most people like the bobbie."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! It's not hard to find and the service was great. From the time I walked in the door to the time I left they treated me with open arms! The place was extremely clean. Nothing bad I can say!

I had the 20\" Bobbie. Yes I finished the sandwich my self and it was perfect."}
{"text":"Dang it Bobbie.  How can you go wrong? My only issue here is my eyes are always bigger than my stomach"}
{"text":"Sandwich shop is just OK.  Did not like the fact that they handed me my sandwich before requesting payment.  Quality of my Grilled Italian sandwich was OK.  My friends Ham and Cheese sandwich was not good.  Opened up the Ham and Cheese and it was in two parts.  Then folded the sandwich together and took one bite and it all fell apart and was very hard to hold and eat.  Place is at a good location, but service OK, & food quality OK.  Better sub shops in town to eat at, Jason's Deli or Sidewinders. =|"}
{"text":"Underwhelming.

That pretty much sums up my recent lunch experience at Capriotti's.  The ordering process was efficient, though the person taking my order exhibited the emotional range of a denizen of the undead horde on the set of the Walking Dead.  On the positive side, the sub shop is located in a new building on the corner of Park and Regent, so the venue is clean and well maintained.

As a corned beef aficionado, I elected to go with their acclaimed Capistrami (hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing and cole slaw).   When I unwrapped my sub, I was aghast at the mound of overdressed slaw slathered across the top of my sandwich.  The slaw vexed the sandwich in a number of ways.  First, moisture from the slaw turned portions of the roll into mush.  Second, the slaw had too much sugar and not enough vinegar, imparting the sandwich with too much sweetness.  Finally, the sodden slaw oozed out of the sandwich with every bite, making the consumption of the sub a sloppy proposition.  A well-prepared sub can elevate a sandwich to lofty height (Exhibit 1 - the Rachel from Stalzy's Deli), but in this case, the slaw is the fatal flaw of the Capistrami.

The quality of the corned beef also disappointed, it just lacked to unctuous flavor of its counterpart at the aforementioned Stalzy's.  I did not see any Swiss cheese on my sandwich, but it is likely all the goopy slaw obfuscated the cheese.  In addition, the Russian dressing had that fresh out of the bottle taste - no thanks.

So will I return to Capriotti's - my culinary magic eight ball says...very doubtful.  I feel I'd have a more enjoyable dining experience at the nearby OSS Madison or across Park Street at Fraboni's."}
{"text":"Best  steak sandwich I had here since I moved here from ny l try to go a couple of days a week when iam working that side of town"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and twice they have not only missed up my order, but the orders of my coworkers. I had one coworker who's chicken sandwich had a bone still in it. Luckily he is not like me and scarfs everything down and found it before he joked on it. Please note that the place was not even that busy when I got there both times.

Now about my sandwiches, and by the way it does not require rocket science to prepare a sandwich. My problem is that they keep adding stuff to the sandwich that I do not want. I should start by saying I am vegan and do not want any animal products in what I eat. Capis does offer such options and I appreciate for that. I have been to other shops that have made some awesome sandwiches. 

On both experiences I had to watch the preparer like a hawk to make sure they did not add any cheese or mayo. Both times after being very clear not to add them, they tried to and I had to tell them to stop. This is ridiculous and down right frustrating. I had to wipe off the mayo the second time because I did not catch them adding it. I would of tossed it, but I was hungry and had nothing else at the time.

Needless to say I will never go to this shop again, unless they have completely new management and crew. All I want is a sandwich without keeling over and dying. Is that a lot to ask for? Go ahead and try the place, but check your sandwich for foreign objects (god knows what else they forget) and good luck getting your order right. I am waiting for the day someone finds a mop in their sammy.

There was more miss ups, but I won't bother mentioning because by now I think you got the picture. On top of all this, service was rude to mediocre at best. They did not even bother bagging my sammy the second time. I really regret tipping them.

Have a nice day. Sorry for the negativity, but someone had to warn people about this shop."}
{"text":"Best sandwich ever, This location is also open 24hrs. We eat here at least 3 times a trip. Have only tried the cheesesteak cause its awesome. Couldn't think of any better option for late night eating."}
{"text":"During a day trip to the Hoover Dam we stopped to get some ice and saw this sandwich shop that boasted \"voted best\" in Las Vegas.  So we went in and ordered and cheese steak sandwich to split with mushrooms, onions, peppers.   The sandwich was 20\" long!!!  And I don't think they were lying!!!!  It is the best cheese steak we have ever had, the sandwich was $17 with high quality ingredients, and The staff was nice too!!   Would go back again if ever in the area"}
{"text":"15 minutes to make a grilled cheese sandwich???? Wtf. Customer service is 1 star. No greeting. No thank you after my purchase. Nothing. This is what happens when good food becomes a franchise."}
{"text":"We came in at around 8:45 , 3 people working . We stood at the counter for a few minutes , finally the girl turns around and says \" if you're ready to order you can go to the register \" every other time I've been there they start my order and then I pay . Finally we get to the register no hello cashier just asked what we wanted to get . We told him two chicken cheese steaks , but also added certain specifications. The guy looked annoyed he told me the total 22.50 , I gave him 23.00 . Idk if he \" forgot \" about the change but he handed me my receipt and said it would be ready soon . When the food was finally ready the same guy who was at the register asked \" did you want a bag ? \" vs \" would you like a bag for that ma'am \" altogether it was just not a great experience. I feel as though if I'm paying you 22.00 for two sandwiches your customer service should be top flight"}

{"text":"I feel like Will Ferrell in Elf on seeing the sign for World's Best Cup of Coffee: \"You did it! Congratulations! World's best cup of coffee! Great job, everybody!\"

And really, the Voted Best Sandwich in America sign is just like that.

It wasn't busy, but the girl at the counter seemed to be struggling. I overheard someone ask her what goes in a salad and her answer was \"I don't know, salads aren't my thing.\" Then I watched her incorrectly ring up the man in front of me, who politely pointed out she was overcharging him. Eek.

I got the turkey sub, which isn't your typical deli sliced turkey, but more like the stuff you have after Thanksgiving. I like it in concept, but it had a funny sweet flavor that wasn't working for me. The toppings on the sub were nothing special, and overall my sandwich didn't have much filling or flavor. I was eating at home, so I dressed it up myself.

The two stars come from the shop being tidy and the speedy service."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to a Capriotti's. Both the Cole Turkey and Capastrami were unexciting and lacked flavor; however, the Italian bread was tasty and the staff was friendly. No military discount."}
{"text":"Ok, brand new place, less than a mile from our place. We love capriotti's, and eat there quite often. We have also been to many locations around the city.
This particular location has one major flaw. The food is excellent at all locations, including this one.
Unfortunately, this location is the only one that puts WAYYYYY less meat on their sandwiches.
I can't say this for sure, but I would assume it's because number 1) it just opened and 2) therefore, they stick to exactly the recommended amount of meat and toppings.
So in the defense of this location, they are really not doing anything wrong.
I gave it one star however, because it's not just a slight difference, it's huge.
If I had to guess, it's probably around 60-70% of the amount the other locations put on the sandwiches.
It's enough for us to make the extra 3 Mile drive to go to the next nearest location.
You can decide for yourself, because like I said, it's still a great sandwich."}
{"text":"I don't eat many fattening sandwiches but when I do I choose Capriotti's. There's are excellent. Not quite Jimmy Johns but almost. Will continue to go there."}
{"text":"#1 thing on the menu is The \"BOBBY\". its like sex in your mouth."}
{"text":"When you decide to become a vegetarian, you realize that there are some sacrifices you are going to have to make in the food department. When I became veg, veggie burgers were made by mixing this powder with water and frying it in a pan. It was horrible. I pretty much ate grilled cheese for the first year. 

Now, fifteen years later, Capriotti's...  Holy Shit!!! VEGGIE TURKEY SUB. Tears of joy are streaming down my face at THIS very moment. It's like losing your virginity all over again, but this time its good! Real good!

For $7.75 I have the hugest, most delicious sub I have ever eaten in my life. Such good quality ingredients, and this medium is HUGE!

They also have New York Kettle Style Chips, which are delish, but you definitely don't need them when you have 12\" of veggie turkey sub staring you down.

My life seriously just changed."}
{"text":"Not your average sub shop!

This is the real deal, because it's not often you find a quality product at reasonable prices. Come with an appetite as well--these subs are nine inches, MINIMUM! That's a lot of bread, I know, but the bread is tasty and simple. No parmesan/oregano/12-grain gimmicks here. 

I went with the Grilled Italian, and for as simple as it was I am still surprised at how good it was. Salami so robust I can taste the kick of black pepper throughout my meal. Sauteed onions and a little tomato to make it complete. Good subs don't even need cheese. Very few ingredients, but give them 10 minutes, and they'll make it well. I will definitely be back soon to try several other varieties."}
{"text":"We called up there to ask about their vegetarian menu and if they offered it vegan style as well. They do! We ordered a 20\" cheese steak without cheese and it is great! We called right and 9pm not realizing they were closing but the lady on the phone insisted they would keep the drive thru open for us. I got there 17 minutes later and she even let me add a drink. She was kind and it wasn't above and beyond to offer to keep the drive thru open for me. Thank you! 
We've been coming here since they opened and I'm never disappointed. This experience though was the best."}
{"text":"Very little to enjoy at Capriottis, outside of the turkey that they roast themselves.  However, after doing so they shread the beast and pile modest amounts of it on indifferent rolls, add insipid stuffing and cloying-sweet cranberry sauce.

I don't expect that much out of a sub shop, and Capriottis is only a mild disappointment.  The only plus is value -- the sandwiches are large.  Get a 12-inch and share it.  You won't want more."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to this sandwich place in 2009. A friend had urged us to go here before the end of our Las Vegas trip. I ordered the SlawBeJo: roast beef, provolone cheese, russian dressing, cole slaw and mayo...Yes, you read it, cole slaw. I think its the cole slaw that made this sandwich soooo good. Their bread is fresh too. I think the key to any good sandwich is the bread. I don't care how much stuff you put into a sandwich. If the bread sucks, you can best believe that the sandwich will too!

The other sandwiches that I've tried are the Cole Turkey and their Cheesteak. The Cole Turkey is just like the SlawBeJo, but with turkey instead. The cheesteak was forgettable."}
{"text":"Food is always great but took about 30 minutes to get my sandwich. Not a good place to grab lunch during the work week unless you like to spend your lunch waiting in a smiley casino. Would recommend the chain but not this location."}
{"text":"Family gets sandwiches here all the time. Never disappointed, always yummy! Sometimes you have to wait a bit even if you call in hour order but that's expected in a smaller shop as this one. Only missing 1 for cleanliness, I don't know if it's the shop being old or what but it could definitely be cleaned up."}
{"text":"Got to this dimly-lit shop at 6:30 PM on a Wednesday evening and was welcomed by three friendly staff.  It was a disappointment that it took over 30 minutes to make our sandwiches even though there was no one waiting in front of us?! Perhaps our vegetarian sandwiches tripped them up.  We had to change our \"vegetarian turkey sandwich\" to \"vegetarian cheeseburger\" 15 minutes into the order when they discovered that they ran out of the former.  I don't think I want to try this place again."}
{"text":"We've been looking for a decent sub place since moving to Scottsdale and haven't had any luck so far. Found Capriotti's via a Yelp search and decided to stop in today. I was hopeful, just by the reviews I'd read. We ordered The Bobbie and the Cole Turkey. Wow! Never experienced any tastes like that before. It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Both sandwiches were outstanding. Absolutely no complaints. Clean establishment, nice and helpful staff. We're most definitely making this a weekly go-to."}
{"text":"Waited patiently to receive my sandwich. Which was... Average...  After Magic Johnson & entourage walked in, they seemed to forget my order.  Had to remind them a couple of times that I was still waiting... (served after at least four of five people who ordered after me...) I know.... First world problems... Right..? At least I got to say, \"Hello\" to MJ. Don't think I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Went for dinner just before closing, steak sandwich was very good, the amount of meat on the sandwich was just right and the bread was soft and fresh.  It was just before closing so I took my sandwich to go however I was not rushed and the guys there were very nice.  I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"Yay!! We have a new sandwich place at Town Square and it can't get better than Capriotti's.  The little sandwich shop is located in the old spot of Jonny Maguire's.  When you walk in, you can swear it's the same restaurant as not much has changed in the set up except the big board menu above the kitchen and ordering stations.  

The staff is super friendly.  They seemed to be as excited as I was to be there, and I hope that time does not take away that enthusiasm because I genuinely appreciated the sincere friendliness.  

I walked in at about 1pm on a Tuesday and there weren't very many people in here.  This is disturbing because I would HATE for them to suffer the same fate as Johnny Maguire's.  I'm hoping once more people realize they are here, they will come.  Build the sandwich, and they will come. 

Anyway, I ordered a small (9-inch) turkey with all the fixings.  In my excitement I had forgotten to tell her I was a mall employee, but to my pleasant surprise, she made sure to ask me before finishing the transaction.  I got a small discount, which I truly appreciated.  Then I waited for my sandwich.  The employee who was making sandwiches called out a couple other people's names and then saw that I was standing there still waiting.  He asked my name, and 2 minutes later my sandwich was ready, and to my surprise, a large instead of the small I had ordered.  

The best part of all of this, how freakin delicious my sandwich was!  What a pleasant experience.  I'm so excited and I hope they are here for the longrun!"}
{"text":"This is Las Vegas's best local sub shop chain hands down. In fact I will go as far as saying that they are like the In n Out Burger of Sub shops and that my friends is a judgement i only bestow on the very best. They are all over the place but this location is special to me because I used to live nearby when I first moved to this city and I would visit them for subs around 4x a week. Also they happen to have an old signed photo from Joe Biden hanging in the shop and its nice to know the Vice President loves Capriottis just as much as his constituents! Everything served here is great and quite unique, go nuts and try something new and different you wont be disappointed. Beware though the Large sized Sub is something like 24\" and every time I take an out of towner there they instinctively order large like they always do anywhere else and to their surprise they get this monstrosity of a sub. Go here often or be ridiculed by those who don't understand your lack of subsational cravings!"}
{"text":"I had been hearing about capriotti's for a while now but my first time was when I had jury duty on the 8th of December.  I will never buy from them again.  The sandwich was very greasy and all I tasted was greasy onions and mushrooms mixed with cheese.  The meat had no flavor at all it was a disgusting sandwich.  Please don't waste your money.  They had the nerve to have tip jars on the counters.  It was a total waste of my money $9.18, I only eat half a sandwich because I was hungry.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins. There was only two other customers. Got our food. The sandwich was overwhelmed with hot pepper and couldn't taste anything else. Got to run, we are running late! I threw mine in the trash!"}
{"text":"The Bobbie sandwich is life changing! haha. We tried Capriotti's once, and then wound up there 2 more times within two weeks. It's a chain in the area, so there are quite a handful throughout Las Vegas. Give them a try! It's yummy."}
{"text":"I am a Jersey girl so I take subs seriously. Going into a sandwich shop on the way to Red Rock I thought I'd be putting together some cheese and lettuce to get a veggie option here,  but dang was I surprised. Amongst the typical deli fare of pastrami and coldcuts I find their veggie \"cheesesteak\" and \"turkey\" sandwiches. I ordered the Veggie Turkey Col with coleslaw and russian dressing on soft,  fresh bread and it was out of this world. Huge, delicious sandwich at the right price. Yum."}
{"text":"I order from here several times a month and won't ever again. I work in the mall and these employees are some of the dumbest, rudest people I've ever encountered! They always seem stoned and slow with customer service. I will not be coming here anymore! I ordered food and the guy \"lost\" my location for where I needed it delivered and instead of calling back he just forgot and it was over 45 mins before I got my food."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the Bobbie.   Next time I will ask if I can have it heated,  but nonetheless super duper delicious!!!  A nine inch sub for $7 full of real homemade pulled turkey (not processed slices),  stuffing and cranberry sauce.   

My other half got the capistrami (pastrami sandwich)  which quickly disappeared also.   There are other varieties of sandwiches here,  but I like sticking to what I know I like.  

It's weird here that you order first and then pay after you get your food.   Staff is very friendly and store was very clean with good music.  

You can also order chips,  soups and desserts (chocolate chip cookie or brownie) and they have drinks.  

This location is open 24 hours and you can order online."}
{"text":"Very expensive...... Not a problem if you get what you pay for. Missing ingredients on two of our orders. This has happened to me at a couple of Capriotti's locations. I also feel every time I walk in that your are almost shammed to leave them a tip. Come on...it's a high dollar Subway."}
{"text":"I love the Bobbie! How can you not? The people that work here are not the friendliest in town but I'm here for the sandwhich not to make friends.  Last time I came here my bf and I split the Medium but wished we had split the Large b/c it was sooooo good. We order it w/ light mayo b/c it needs the mayo but trying not to have too many calories. 
I wish I could say I've had other sandwhiches here but I cant. why would you when theres the bobbie? If it aint broke, dont fix it."}
{"text":"First of all, the great service at this location cannot be replaced. I lived down the street from this Capriotti's but I moved further away this last month and yet I still go to this location! The guys are hilarious and accommodating. It's just always a pleasant experience at this particular location.

Secondly, the food is just as great if not better than the service. If you love sandwiches, you'll love Capriotti's. I've taken so many of my friends for their first Capriotti's experience here, and literally not one of them have ever been disappointed.

If you're vegetarian, try the veggie turkey. It's amazing!!! I cannot stop raving about that sandwich. I ate it everyday for two months haha. If you're not vegetarian, try the Bobbie! It's basically a Thanksgiving dinner on a sandwich.

Long story, short, come to this Capriotti's! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Hot Italian with marinara and hot red peppers, get ittttt, so yum!!!! We waited a little longer than usual yesterday due to the sausage being frozen, but the staff offered us a $2 coupon for next time. Not necessary, but it was a nice gesture."}
{"text":"the Chicken Cheesesteak was spicy and delicious! thank you \"lashes\". great recommendation:) 4/26/14, 1330"}
{"text":"Placed my order over the phone, the order taker was super friendly & nice. Super effortless. They said my order will be ready in 10 minutes. Arrived about 15+ minutes to get my order, and was greeted by everyone there, even by the guy preparing the sandwiches. Everyone had a big smiles on their faces and not to mention my sandwich, The Bobbie, was delcious! My son is a very picky eater, and he loved it. The shop was very clean too."}
{"text":"So I was calling to see if this place was open , didn't answer the first time so I just thought it was closed. Then my boyfriend said no there defiantly open I said okay & tried to call again and place my order. Once again still did not answer!!! 
Once we got there we saw that the place was open & placed our order. We get in there they're literally asking each other if I'm calling again lol not knowing I'm standing right there and talking shit! 
Very disrespectful staff!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday and it was so good had to come back again. Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"I have passed them about ten thousand times, just never stopped. Since I was having a lock repaired next door there was no reason not to try them.Glad that I did. Being a first-time customer I was a little over whelmed with the large variety of sandwiches. I asked the cashier and she replied that the most popular was the small Bobby. She described it as a thanksgiving dinner on a sub roll. Sliced real turkey,stuffing, cranberry sauce, etc. Ordered the small 9 inch, could have, should have taken half home. Stuffed  to my gills. Service was fast even at noon. I over heard most of the customers ordering the small Bobby as well. I'll be back."}
{"text":"One of the few great things about Vegas is the fact that we have several Capriotti's in town. This place is awesome! My favorite sandwich is the Capastrami, (Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw). I get it with the hot peppers for a boost of flavors. Carriotti's is sandwich nirvana."}
{"text":"Best sandwich is the sausage and peppers with Marinara and some of their hot peppers. Get the 20 inch and heat up the other half the following day. It's even better left over. Not all locations are perfect, but this one is fantastic."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious sandwiches at Capriotti's.  This location is in a gas station location off of I-15.
I love that they offer veggie meats.  But when I went in at around noon and asked for a veggie turkey sandwich, they said they were out of it.  At noon?  Are you kidding?  I ended up with the only veggie option they had left, a veggie cheesesteak.  It wasn't bad at all and that's where the three stars come in.  But the service was very slow, took 20 minutes to get my meal and the store was dirty. Floor and tables were sticky.  My wife was very impressed with the sandwiches and she's a Subway fan.  But I'm betting if there was a Subway on one side of the street and Capriotti's on the other, she would go to Capriotti's.  Hopefully it will be in a better area and a better store.
Let's hope this place branches out more into L.A.  Only a couple here."}
{"text":"First time ever at a Capriottis. I had read how good the sandwiches are. I went in and it looked promising.  Excellent location. Great interior: TV's, a chronology of the history of  Capriottis, nicely arranged.  Lots of choices on the board. I ordered a Veggie Cole Turkey, vegetarian turkey with cole slaw. I asked Davianna if the sandwich included onions and she said no. I received my sandwich, nicely wrapped and taped.  Went back to my vehicle and dug in. To my disappointment, not only was the sandwich not vegan turkey, there was no cole slaw and plenty of onions. So I returned and explained, with my receipt, that the order was wrong. To their credit, they apologized, offered me a free upgrade and made me what I wanted originally.

After the frustration of feeling that they just didn't pay attention when I ordered, I tried the sandwich and it was excellent.  Cole slaw was perfect and the vegan turkey was tasty.  And no onions this time. :)

Without the trouble, I probably would have given it a 4+.  I will definitely try this franchise again."}
{"text":"Its been 3-5 years since i had a Bobbie.

3-5 years too long. Today's bobbie was so good. Thank you for the quickly made sandwich! Yummm"}
{"text":"They didn't ask if I wanted the sweet peppers and onions on the cheesesteak. I totally forgot about it and remembered the second I opened up the butcher paper. The cheesesteak just wasn't the same. The Bobbie, was amazing though. 

50 miles round trip to get here from North Scottsdale - it was worth it."}
{"text":"If your from Vegas, Capriattis is the real deal sandwich shop.   Back in the day, right?   BUT this store is the WORST!  Tried to give it a few chances but no more.   The staff was purposely dragging their feet...  obviously some sort of coworker feud.  Terrible customer service,  sorrowful faces,  and anywhere else would be preferred than working here looks.  Bye bye."}
{"text":"There's not much to say about the Vegas sandwich titan that is Capriotti's.  This is a solid location on the corner of Lake Mead and Boulder Highway (Albertson's shopping center), formerly occupied by Boardhouse Subs.  Since it's very close to our house, I've already been a few times since it opened.  The service was a bit slow in the beginning, but they are learning and improving very quickly.  The last time I went in you would never know that this place hasn't been open long.  There are several places to sit, it's a good sized location with plenty of parking.  Glad to have this addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place has been opening a plethora of shops around the Vegas Valley. They are a welcome addition to the sandwich shops of the valley, but they aren't going to be taking the throne away from Subway anytime soon.

For the positives, Capriotti's has excellent service. The employees in here are always friendly, with a good sense of humor, and are willing to help you out and answer questions. They have a decent selection of items, including the Bobbie, their trademark sandwich that pretty much crams all things Thanksgiving into one small space. They also have a cooler with many drinks to choose from, including stuff not many other places have, such as Sobe and Cherry Pepst. 

Unfortunately, the place doesn't quite stack up against places like Subway. Their selection of items/toppings/sauces/inc. pales in comparison. And the prices are outrageous. For 4 of us to eat there last night (with only ONE of us getting a drink!), it was over $30. For that price, you might as well just go to a dine-in restaurant!

Capriotti's has quality food, I just wish they had a better selection of items and lower prices. If you're in the neighborhood, they are worth checking out - but keep your expectations in check."}
{"text":"Called to make a to-go order. Guy said it will take 12 mins. We parked at the To-go parking spot, which allows you to be parked there for 10 mins. We get there and are waiting for 25 mins. They didn't even start on our sandwiches. What's the use of calling in to have a sandwich to-go and have a to-go parking spot if you're going to be slow as heck"}
{"text":"Well I guess you could say I had a hiccup with my order.. In their defense they were slammed with lunch, but maybe they could bring in a few more employees during this time, seeing that it's a usual occurrence, to have an hour + delivery time for lunch orders. I ordered a Bobbie, and a cheesesteak, and after an hour delivery, received 2 cheesesteaks.. I called the shop to notify them someone else who ordered a cheesesteak would be calling with a Bobbie.. And they more than apologized and took my name saying if I call back within the next week they would replace. I told them I don't really order from here and if I was to order again I would like my whole ticket replaced..  He asked me to call back the next day and talk with a manager. I did. And I called an hour earlier than the day before (trying to avoid the lunch rush) and Matt, MOD, stated he was slammed again, short handed, and would have to call me back. I agreed but was skeptical when he said he needed to talk to me about replacing the whole order. But when he called back things were very different.. He let me know the wait was about an hour, but said the food would be there. Which it was delivered in about 45 mins.. Charge free. So THANK YOU MATT for keeping your word, and coming thru for me!"}
{"text":"Great Philly cheese sandwich but I always add my seasoning salt to it when I get it home.. a little spendy but all in all great service and fresh food.."}
{"text":"Killer subs, unique menu, simple and clean interior.  The level of flavor is almost off the charts.  I loved my Italian, and want to return to try turkey subs and the crazy Capastrami. One complaint: It was a much longer wait than expected. Whether dining in or taking out, I'd be inclined to order ahead next time."}
{"text":"Don't go to this stupid store. Every other capriottis is fine but not this location. I only get one sandwich whenever I eat here. Capistrami with no coleslaw. The last 5 times we have gone, they hand us a Capistrami with slaw and we make them do another one. Will never come back to this store."}
{"text":"Oh my, bye bye Subway! I had the best turkey sandwich I've ever eaten... \"The Bobbie\", a Thanksgiving meal in a sandwich, what a wonderful concept! I will definitely be a regular and will bookmark all locations :-)! Pastrami sandwich was good too... Bread tastes like it came right out of the oven!"}
{"text":"Great prices (considering that this Capriotti's is located within Red Rock Casino!) excellent customer service and delicious food! Free refills too! Lots of seating. 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Ordered their cheesesteak it wasn't as cheesy as I wanted and too hot they put too many peppers. I think it's over priced you usually get fries with the amount I paid."}
{"text":"Online ordering has been down for 2 weeks. Ill just keep taking my business elsewhere. Location is way too slow for me to go in"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to this location for years but today will be our last time. The staff were so nasty and unprofessional. We ordered sandwiches for the whole family for pickup. When we got home we realized they had forgotten one of our sandwiches. We called the restaurant and they tried to tell us that we didn't order it. We explained that we were charged for it and we wanted it. The person on the phone rudely said \"WELL WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO ABOUT IT?\"We asked to have them deliver it since it was their error. They told us they don't have delivery because they were \"too busy.\" We went back to the restaurant and as we walked in, a delivery guy was standing there getting an order ready. I didn't appreciate being lied to. I was told that because our order was already placed they couldn't arrange delivery and that it was our fault for not checking our order before we left. I thought a customer could trust that their order would be accurate. I was really put off with how this was handled. Mistakes happen, but no excuse to treat your loyal customers like garbage."}
{"text":"Nothing worse then getting home from picking up an order and it's all wrong .. I had to make a second trip because they didn't put veggies in my vegetarian sandwich and I asked for a turkey and cheese warm , we still got it cold .. how hard is it to make a sandwich? My daughter just said out loud , I'm pretty sure this is the worst sandwich I ever tasted , and I feel the same . Never again.  Here's pictures of me cooking the turkey trying to make it edible for her. After talking to the manager about the problem I can see why everything runs messed up there, he doesn't care either."}
{"text":"If you guys are to going to advertise that your open till 9 pm, you really need to stick to those hours. My family and I love to eat here but it's not close to our house. We drove from Tempe to Val vista to come to this location, then walk up with the doors locked and a employee just standing there when your door clearly says open till 9pm. Google , my maps , your door and this yelp app show this location being open till 9pm. I advise you to either stick to that closing time or charge it on all of those sites so other people that live far don't drive all that way to locked doors. Now if the owners don't know about this location closing earlier then you should maybe speak with your employees about doing their jobs right."}
{"text":"Crappy service. Came in to order one sandwich. Told me 30 min wait because they are in middle of a big order.  Employees goofing off while making sandwiches. Should have one person working counter orders."}
{"text":"Very disappointed of this dining experience, honestly. I usually order the bobbie sub, but the food quality is very bad at here. They just put a very little cranberry sauce in the sub and no taste. I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"I eat here a lot and progressively the service and quality had gotten worse.

First, they would skimp on their mushrooms when ordering a cheese steak...then why charge for it!

Anyway, ordered at 12:44 pm a small sub with mushrooms. Had to ask about my order at 1:20 pm...guess what it was just sitting there supposedly.

Then you guessed it no mushrooms. C'mon people...and they aren't even that busy.

Avoid and go to a different location if possible."}
{"text":"The Bobbie is like Thanksgiving year-round. 

Enough said."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before but apparently, there is one in Los Angeles too. Me and my group of friends on our way to Zion National Park in Utah stopped here and I saw a pastrami sandwich so I tried it. After having Langer's Deli in Los Angeles and having their pastrami sandwich, nothing else really compares. Capriotti's Capastrami sandwich does not compare to Langer's legendary #19. The Capastrami comprises of hot pastrami in a roll with cole slaw, swis cheese, and Russian dressing. I added cucumbers and tomatoes to add extra health value to it. Ultimately, the sandwich was oversauced. I could not taste the pastrami at all and I felt a little sick afterwards.

One of my other friends ordered the \"Bobbi\" sandwich which consisted of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce to give it the Thanksgiving theme. The sandwich was way too heavy for the quarter portion that I had. One of my other buddies told me that the Italian sandwich was good so maybe I should have gotten that. Either way, this sandwich shop is okay. Not the best I have had, but by and large not the worst. If there had been less sauce on the Capastrami, I would have given this place a higher rating."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is the best (chain) sandwich shop in America.  My go-to is the Hot Bobbie with extra Cranberry.  The ultimate is if you're with someone that likes this sandwich too.  You can get a jumbo 20\" and share it.

This particular location ins exceptionally clean.  They serve their \"for here\" sandwiched on on GD porcelain plate for crying out loud."}
{"text":"The Bobby was so good! I added two slice of provolone which was a nice touch. The 9\" for $7.35 is an incredible deal. And the quality of the food was up to par. I'd choose this place over Subway any day!"}
{"text":"I got the cheese steak and it was the best sandwich I've had so far. Very friendly staff, spoke with me about their different options and deals. Best part, the sandwiches are huge."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was not impressed. This location in Henderson was dirty. The tables were all dirty. Trash on the floor. The sandwich was way too big and expensive. Also no fountain soda. I don't get the hype. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pretty good sandwiches. Large sandwiches. 
Would say earl of sandwiches is better. 
Cheese steak tastes similar to philly. Capastrami is good"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and had the grilled Italian sub.  Others had the philly cheese steak sub.  Everything was really really good!  Big portions too!  Will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"It was hot, we were hungover from our previous Vegas shenanigans, we were stuck in traffic on our way to the Hoover Dam, and we were hungry.  We don't generally like to eat at fast food places, so when we saw a sign that said sandwich shop, we chose to eat there.  I'm quite happy that we did, too!

I got the Bobby, which is what I generally refer to as a Thanksgiving sandwich.  It had freshly carved turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing.  Very tasty!  I do have to say it was a tiny bit dry, but in their defense I ordered it without mayo because mayo is icky.  I would have preferred a bit of gravy tossed into the mix, but it was still a high quality sandwich.  My boyfriend ordered the roast beef, which was also freshly carved, and which he also enjoyed.

The service was fast and friendly, and as we were leaving one of the girls there advised us to take the scenic route to the Hoover Dam in order to bypass about a half hour's worth of dam traffic (hehe).  We did so, and wanted to go back and hug her for the advice!  We went from practically not moving and miles away from our destination, to being at our destination in a matter of about 10 or 15 minutes.

Hoorays all around!"}
{"text":"Was in town visiting a friend on a Sunday evening. We decided to make it easy and get some subs for dinner.  We tried 3 different ones, pastrami, steak and cheese and the turkey.  The each had a name but I can't remember

I was very y disappointed with two of the three.  Especially the turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce one. I think they forgot to put the turkey on it.  Terrible. Steak and cheese a bread on bread  sandwich.  
 Pastrami was Okay.  I think what saved it was the coleslaw and I'm pretty sure I tasted some Swiss cheese.

If you don't have much of a choice I suppose the place is ok but maybe they can offer a little up charge for some extra meat.  Or weigh the ingredients  of the  sandwiches so you get the right balance."}
{"text":"Probably in my top 10 things I have eaten in Vegas. I love the Bobbie and probably get one every other week. I did branch out and get a Slaw B Joe and that was unreal too."}
{"text":"I wish I could give no stars I stopped by tonight for a sandwich after class at 730. The sign says 8 right ?! Welp the gentleman put up the sign as he saw me coming in . Honestly 30 mins early when you know a person in there is just rude . Screw this place never again"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always fresh and so delicious. I've never had more than a 5 minute wait. The staff is always warm and welcoming. I highly recommend stopping in. Keep up the good work! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food, but if you're vegan, STAY AWAY. Don't be fooled by the faux meat."}
{"text":"Worst sandwich place ever I don't know what came up we end up eating here soup is cold my salad was dry looks like my backyard weed the only this was good was my potato chips in the bag"}
{"text":"Decided to check out Capriottis for some late night eats.  The s/o and I decided to go with what everyone was raving about and ordered the Capastrami and the Bobbie and shared a half of each to try the best that Capriottis has to offer.

Just like everyone has said, the Capistrami is so legit.  That is one sandwich with a ton of heft an a ton and half of flavor.  The pastrami was so flavorful, but what was really good was that the cole slaw just complimented the sandwich.

The Bobbie, which surprisingly was my favorite, should seriously change it's name to \"Thanksgiving Express\" because it's seriously what would be on your plate during Thanksgiving dinner, less the mashed potatoes of course, piled up in a roll.  It was delicious yet comforting at the same time.  The turkey was fresh and was real turkey, not your cold cut turkey here.

Now if someone would only open a Capriottis up in the Bay Area, that would be super sweet!  Until then, Capriottis is yet another awesome spot for us to hit up while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and the usual, high-quality Capriotti's sandwiches.  What more needs to be said?  Keep in mind that, for better or worse, drinks here are served in packaged containers, not a soda fountain."}
{"text":"As Capriotti's stores go, the food has been very consistent from location to location.  What makes this one a 4 star location instead of a 3 is the extra-friendly employees that I've encountered both times I've visited.  Unlike others' experiences, I didn't experience any long waits or incorrect orders on either visit.  Seating seems more than ample since almost no one I've seen dines in (other than me).  Parking is ok but I can see it getting really crowded at peak hours."}
{"text":"Everything to like about Capriotti's, friendly staff and awesome sandwiches, and cheaper than most of the other Vegas locations!  Awesome!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try Capriotti's for a long time but every time I'd pass by a Capriotti's both here in Las Vegas and in Southern California, I'd eaten a meal a short time before.  Finally, the timing was right and I got to try their famous Bobbie sandwich: turkey, stuffing, cranberry, and mayo.  Looked kind of dry but was really good.  The turkey wasn't salty, the stuffing was tasty and had a nice texture, and the bread was really good, even though I don't usually like white bread.  There seemed to be too much cranberry (not usually a fan) but I was mistaken.  There was just enough to complement the turkey and stuffing.  Will definitely return to a Capriotti's on my next trip back to the mainland."}
{"text":"I only get the Bobbie. It's as good as when I was a kid. The people working here are friendly. The chip and drink selection is good. I love everything bundt cakes that the have as well. Try a Bobbie! You won't be disappointed! I don't even like thanksgiving food but the Bobbie is my favorite sand which."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's but this location is very inconsistent.  Sometimes I get the best sandwich and other times it is bland or very greasy.  Service is good and if you call ahead the food is ready fast."}
{"text":"That Bobbie was amazing... If you ever want to have a thanksgiving inspired sandwich get that BOBBIE! Turkey, cranberry sauce and mayo all in a roll... Does not disappoint."}
{"text":"We found it on yelp and came here with high expectation since this sandwich shop have many locations in LV.  But I guess this is kind of like local sandwich shop.  The capriotti pastrami sandwich is not bad, but not outstanding either, plus this location is purely for to go (even no dine in area).  We didn't want to eat in the car with 110 degree outside so we ate the sandwich at the Del Taco restaurant next door.  For sandwich in LV, I still vote for Earl Sandwich in Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches we went during lunchtime and service was a little slow. Some people that ordered after us got their sandwich before us we only ordered three sandwiches it's almost like they forgot our order. The size of a small sandwich is very big. The Bobbie sandwich in the cheesesteak are our favorites."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat around the area and we had to try a place that has a 4+ star rating. As soon as you look at the place, all you see are awards ranging from 2006 - 2012. Capriotti's Sandwich Shop was voted best sandwich shop in Las Vegas for 6 years. It lives up to the hype and the awards. 

We tried the Chicken Cheesesteak and the Capastrami. Two amazingly delicious sandwiches. Its hard to put words on paper about the fireworks that was going off in my mouth and satisfaction my tummy felt bite after bite. Next time we are in Las Vegas, We will surly be back and try the Bobbi that everyone else on yelp talks about. 

Woohoo!!! I can't get enough of Capriotti's Sandwich Shop. Looking forward to trying the Bobbi."}
{"text":"I had Capriotti's a couple years ago in San Diego, so I was in Vegas for the weekend and decided to stop here for lunch. This place is so awesome. Their menu is simple and their sandwiches are great.

The turkey, it's not like that thin slimy deli crap. They roast turkeys and carve them fresh every day. So it's like Thanksgiving turkey quality, shredded. So it's good stuff for sure.

Man, the 'Cole Turkey', not their signature sandwich, but soooo good. Turkey, cole slaw, provolone, special sauce on a hoagie."}
{"text":"I visit Las Vegas for work a few days out of every month. A few months ago a coworker treated me to one of Capriotti's Sandwich Shop's subs and I liked it, I liked it a lot. 

The restaurant is a Quiznos Sub Shop or Subway Restaurant type but better. A wide variety or sandwiches and subs, but my personal favorites in the hot steak and cheese with mushrooms, peppers and onions. The clouds part because it's heavenly. I have a few others on my to do list too. 

4 stars! Why? It's what I want in a quick and easy sandwich shop. Order in or take out and phenomenal food.  It's a must if and when I visit Las Vegas.  Why not 5 stars?  Not exactly an invited dine in experience but...  Don't think you're not my favorite Cap.  You are!"}
{"text":"Always one of the best places to get a sandwich in Las Vegas, Capriottis is dependable and consistent. Their Veggie Bobbie* is delicious and their other vegetarian options are on par as well. I have to have my Bobbie once a month at least.

*Not really vegetarian. They use Chicken broth for the Stuffing. Capriottis does tell you this upon ordering"}
{"text":"This place is excellent from the customer service to the food!!! We come here every time we are in Vegas. We tried the roast beef, Italian sub, turkey, cheesesteak, and capistrami and every sandwich was amazing !!!! Please go try and they are open 24hrs! Also if you do a review online you will get a free small sub."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak was amazing would order again! Meatball not soo much it seemed like a mostly cheese and bread with some sauce sandwich only meatballs on one half of the bread just had to break off the half where there was no meat. For the price you would think they could at least give enough meatballs to cover the whole sandwich. Subway has way better meatball subs for half the cost."}
{"text":"I love this Capriottis place they are clean and great customer service! I have gone to other Caps in Vegas and this one on Azure is my Favorite. If they mess up they fix it fast. Great customer service and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This was a decent visit to Capriottis . I initially ordered by phone using Siri on my iPhone because I saw this store on a drive. Well when I got there I realized I called in my order to the wrong Capriottis. The guy was nice enough. He took my order and everything. My sandwich was ready in like 3 minutes. He literally rung me up, gave me my change, and by the time I walked to the fridge and got a bottled drink it was ready. The only thing bad I can say is that the turkey on my Bobbie was REALLY dry ! Like it had been sitting out . It sucks because I haven't had Capriottis in so long that this was a bad Come back lol otherwise it was good ."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best sandwiches I have had in a long time. I had this for lunch while visiting Vegas on a business trip and wanted to go back for the same sandwich for dinner. I ordered the Bobbie and wow it was like Thanksgiving rolled up into a great sandwich. The sandwich consists of Thanksgiving style hot turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Awesome concept for a sandwich!"}
{"text":"The Bobbie, in my opinion, is the best sandwich ever. It is thanksgiving on a bun. I know, sounds a little crazy, but it is soooo good. This local sandwich show is all over VEGAS and is a super yummy and fast meal. Besides amazing food, they yell out \"beer money\" when you tip and everyone yells \"thanks\". It just really nice to be acknowledged when you tip. Anyway, if you haven't tried it out yet, they have lots of options to choose from. Not your traditional sandwich shop. And they have salads and Wise chips too."}
{"text":"The caprasrami is what you should get! Go large for 20\" of this bad boy. 

My wife and I thought it was really good.

The salty, hot pastrami mixed with a tangy, cold slaw on a soft philly roll does it.

I'm assuming this is a Philly staple because they serve tasty kakes.

Since there are multiple locations off the strip, there's no excuse to not try this place!

My only complaint is that it could have had more meat...there's never too much meat!"}
{"text":"horrible service, quality, and food. they made the sandwhich my friend ordered twice and he finished eating before i even got my sandwhich. then they forgot to put mushrooms on the sandwhich that i payed extra for. then they grilled me mushrooms that smelled like male sperm."}
{"text":"Will not be going back to this location again. Ordered a pastrami sandwich and opened it up because it was literally leaking in oils and sauce and there was a dark thick long hair in my sandwich in the coslaw ! Disgusting :("}
{"text":"nMy husband and I stopped by on a Saturday afternoon,( 6-3-17) to order some sandwiches, the place was PACKED....I placed our order to go, there was standing room only so I told my husband looks go to PetSmart for a bit then we\"ll come get our sandwiches. we walked in to pick up our order and another customer asked if I already ordered and I said yes.......she said to be sure and check our food for hair....another customer at the counter with the same problem food in the sandwiches, as I look in the kitchen area I see a female working on our sandwiches with long brown hair and no hair net on, I told my husband I don\"t want to take a chance I'm going to get my money back, there were 3 people ahead of us getting their money refunded also, in the meantime a gentleman had been waiting on his order for over 20 mins, he also wanted his cancelled.....This was not a good day for Capriottis!!! needless to say I will not be visiting this location again."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time after a night out drinking and let me just say that God is real; this is seriously the best sandwich place I've ever been to. Get The Bobbie!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I don't go here more often, but I guess it's a good thing as it's the type of thing you could (maybe) get burned out on.... Or I fear the BF will get burned out on it, but my love of Thanksgiving sandwiches will still be on fire. 

It's not in a busy shopping center, so I don't think a lot of people know it's there, at least I didn't until I searched for one specifically by the house. 

They have various kinda of sandwiches, cold cuts and hot, but I stick with turkey based sandwiches. Turkey is one of those weird guilty pleasure comfort foods I have so naturally get the Bobbie, and sometimes the Cole Turkey. The BF gets Bobbies or Capastramis. I did try the vegetarian turkey at a event once, and I would be hard pressed to realize that isn't meat.

I hear much about their cheesesteaks, and maybeee one day I will bust out my routine and order one."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is a place that has off early hours so I normally eat dinner when the shops are closed. This one is a exception and will give you your late night fix since they're open til 2am. The BF and I stopped on the off chance we were on the eastside and needed a late night snack. 

I don't know what it is about Bobbies, but its a favorite of mine.  Thankgiving leftover sandwiches is one of the things I look to the holidays though I want and can eat this year round- this is where Capriotti's fills that gap for me. Sometimes I get the Cole Turkey or Capastrami, but Bobbies are usually it for me. 

Just a note that this location does not do the large 20inch subs. Only small and medium sized so XL appetites may be let down by that. Prices I think are the same so I don't think there is casino inflation (am I jaded by the strip to think all of them will inflate?).

Not much to say here that hasn't been said... It's in the Green Valley Ranch, open late, has solid sandwiches and nice service."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hard Rock near this sub shop. Went with my uncle to check to it out and it was okay. Not worth the money to be honest. Quality of the steak could of been better. Bread could of been better. I'd rather go to the Pizza Spot next door which is amazing to be honest ."}
{"text":"I have to say that my first experience with capriottis was not a good one. Not necessarily a bad one either but it didn't make me want to come back again. I have to say I am glad I gave it another try. My first visit was just not impressive. The food was ok but I could have made a better sandwich at home is honestly what I was thinking. But this last time I went. I had a philly cheese steak sandwich. Yum! Gotta say I liked it. And I am super picky about my steak sandwiches. Prolly because they first time I had a Philly was when my bf's grandpa made them with some really expensive steak. I was spoiled and ruined for any other philly I ate there after lol anyways although it was not even comparable to the philly my bf's grandpa made it was still quite good :)"}
{"text":"I kept hearing people at work rave about Capriotti's, so I ventured over for lunch, and I was not impressed.

As someone who's favorite holiday is Thanksgiving, I immediately wanted The Bobbie- turkey, cranberry, and stuffing. The sandwich was gigantic, especially considering the price point.

However, when I got to the office and tore into my sandwich, I was disappointed that the stuffing tasted very much like Stovetop. I guess for some people that wouldn't be bad, but I am not a fan of Stovetop. The rest of the ingredients were good, but the stuffing really ruined the sandwich. If I'm going to commit carb-icide, it better be worth it.

The cheesesteak looked pretty tasty, so I might give that a shot, but I'm not really clamoring to make a return visit anytime soon."}
{"text":"Capriottis is one of those chains that I can't help but like. They still kept their character and have a homemade feel among most sandwich places where your food comes from a premeasured, pre prepared food box ready to assemble to max fast food capacity. Sure, you can wait for a bit, specially since this place seems always busy but is 5 minutes extra wait all that bad for a good sandwich? 

I also never take polite, friendly service for granted. I somehow have ended up at this Capriotti's twice, odd considering I live in the NW and rarely ever down this way, but each time they had someone at the counter with a smile, wishing me a great day. Their tip jar seems to always be filled with dollars and I can see why! Of course I had to add a Washington into that jar. Maybe the positive vibes of the world wanted me to get my turkey sandwich with a smile today. 

Oh, and as I was waiting for my Cole Turkey I saw that they put up Michael and Jena's review on their wall among other accomplishments. You can see they have some pride in good work. 

Keep it up :-)"}
{"text":"Cappriotti's would get five stars from me because they are super delicious however the problems with Carpiottis is that they are so friggin' slow I''m pretty sure they are like dry aging their ham for each individual order or something.  Trust though, I am not one of those reviewers who had one bad experience and suddenly wants to use yelp as my soap box to put a business on blast.  Every...time...I...order...it...takes.....f....o..r..e..v...e...r. I'm down to wait like 10 15 minutes (ala In N Out Burger) but it seems like Cappriottis takes like 1/2 an hour for a sandwich like ever time.  I would say if you really really love their food definitely call ahead, if not you will be sitting around for forever."}
{"text":"I think the staff is nicer at the other Capriotti's I've reviewed. Also this one has a long and open layout where you can smell the food going a lot more....today it was kinda smoky. Oddly, this one doesn't have a public restroom either so bring wipes if you get messy with your sammies. 

There's not much to say that most people already don't know.

 I like Thanksgiving dinner a lot and do have cravings for the Bobby and know it's pretty consistent. 

I'll probably be back to this location since it's the closest to mom and grandma in laws house, but I prefer the location by home much more."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's - I don't know anyone whose tried it and denied it.  My favorite is the Capastrami (pastrami, cole slaw, Russian dressing, yum).  A close second to me is the Bobbie (turkey dinner in a cold sandwich - turkey, stuffing, cranberry dressing, yum).  Also in the running is their cheese steak.   Their large sandwich is definitely enough for even three people to share.  I normally get the foot long to share with my husband and it fills us up just fine.

I have to agree with the other reviews on this location though - the food takes long to get!  I don't know what it is.  Other locations get your sammies out in an adequate time.  I found us waiting for 2 sandwiches for almost 20 minutes one time - and the place was empty!  That's why this place loses a star for me.

Anyways, if you're wondering whether or not you should try it - go for it.  The sandwiches won't disappoint.  Hopefully you won't have to wait long for it!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable,,,,,cockroaches all over the wall by the kitchen where the bread is stored! We witnessed this unsanitary condition after we had placed our order.  Once we sat down waiting for our order roaches were also crawling on the floor and wall.  We told the guy that worked there and he said \"yeah\"
Someone needs to inspect this location."}
{"text":"Worst Cap I've been to I asked one question about a salad I wanted to kno what crispy cheddar onions are ? Are they deep friend what do they look like are the made in house pre packaged anyway the cashier then said she didn't kno walked over to the guy who makes the salad he laughed really hard at the question and said what that's what they are she came back to say they are just crispy cheddar onions that was not enough for me so I asked for it with out them and with out tomatoes what happens when I was served my salad with tomatoes. So I sent it back they guy that laughed said I'll remake it but had a attitude I didn't put tomatoes in there sir you did so just remake it you work at a food place anyway so he starts slamming things around and remakes it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Had my son order my a sandwich. Ordered a grilled Italian with sweet peppers, no lettuce, no tomatoes. Got the sandwich home... No peppers. Tones of lettuce and tomatoes. WORST SANDWICH EVER. I will NEVER at this location ever again. EVER!!!!"}
{"text":"We are here last night and ordered the \"Bobbie\".  My favorite.  After we ordered they ran out of stuffing.  We took the sandwich.  I guess to compensate they decided to give us more cranberry sauce than turkey in our sandwich."}
{"text":"Fast friendly right by work. Tasty as always! Got the large, my \"all day food\"! Capistrami was my choice of the day and my #1 overall and then the Bobbie as a really close runner up."}
{"text":"BEST sandwiches is Las Vegas hands down.  Just ordered two massive platters of sandwiches for my granddaughters teachers.  The Bobbie is my favorite...the thanksgiving turkey dinner between a freshly baked Italian sub roll.  Ridiculously delicious 

The Slaw be jo is no slouch either."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this shop happened to be during one of the hottest days of the year. The 1st thing that caught my attention was how dirty & filthy the windows were. When a restaurant doesn't appear clean, you can imagine what the rest of it is like. The employee working the counter who took our order was super upbeat, friendly and funny. Great attitude. He then made some suggestions and his level of customer interaction was 100%. Then he took our order and we waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. It took a good 20 minutes of sitting in front of the windows on a super hot day. It literally felt like we were getting cooked because the store was getting direct sunlight in the later part of the afternoon. So my main gripe here was the long time we had to wait in uncomfortable heat. Inside must have been 85 degrees and I felt sorry for the food preparation workers over the cook top. The food was what we expected but the wait was not. Do not expect a jimmy johns 2 minute wait here."}
{"text":"I love their sandwiches but they are VERY over priced AND.... they do not have whole wheat bread.  They were definitely behind the times by not having a whole wheat bread instead of WHITE bread.  Every other sandwich place I know has whole wheat..  Fire House Subs, subway, port of subs, quiznos. etc..

Come on Capriotti's get some damm whole wheat french bread."}
{"text":"I always get the \"Bobbie\" (corn bread stuffing, cranberries, turkey and mayo). Soooo delicious! I've been getting it for years and they haven't let me down yet. 

It's a small little deli style restaurant. You can order over the phone or at the restaurant. There's usually a decent wait so I order over the phone as often as I can."}
{"text":"what can I say that hasn't been said already about Capriotti's? Don't think I've had a bad sandwich yet. My favorites are the Bobbie and the grilled italian.

If I had to criticize anything it would be that the roast beef. While it has great flavor it is always so dry. 

Staff is always very friendly at this location. Love that we can order online from work and have it ready to pick up. Saves time and easy to do. 

Suggestions for Capriotti's: different sub rolls (or at least wheat) and some more sandwich combinations."}
{"text":"I loved this place. The fact that this place is so near my house is a major plus. I was on my way to get my iphone 5 next door at the at & t store where I stumbled upon this shop. My friend were all raving about this franchise and I thought I give it a shot.

WOW WOW WOW. Absolutely amazing capastrami. Finished a foot long by myself and absolutely enjoyed coming here. Brought 2 friends from out of town and they were blown out of their head too.

Absolutely bomb diggity!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I've ever had in my entire life and depending on the size it can be HUGE...

I ordered a regular cheese and chicken sandwich but a friend ordered the huge massive long sandwiches and take my word, it  really is HUGE...."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but the service is horrible. I tried getting the ladies name that helped me but no name tag! Not friendly and super grumpy!"}
{"text":"My friends said that if I'm looking for an amazing deli, I had to try Capriotti's. There are many cultural differences between the east and west coast - one of them is the definition of a deli sandwich. This place makes SUBS - not deli sandwiches. 

If you are looking for an upgrade to Subway, go here! If you are looking for that classic Italian deli with amazing fresh bread and an interesting range of topping and condiment options, I guess you have to go out of state, as I just have not found it in Phoenix.

I ordered the 20 inch italian - it sounded naughty. :) The roll was fresh and doughy with a slightly crunchy crust. The meat was extremely high grade deli fixings - salami, peppered ham, and some other italian salami, roasted peppers, pickles, and viniagarette. For being a sub sandwich, all three of us enjoyed it fully. BUT, it's not a deli sandwich - it's a sub.

The gentlemen behind the counter were SO NICE - I would come back just to talk to them again because it was like they were all one big happy family."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich place! I usually get the Capastrami or the Bobbie. I've also had the Italian and it is good, but the other two are the best! There is nothing like this place in AZ. After eating here, the thought of eating at Subway makes me sick to my stomach, gross! Love this place!!"}
{"text":"I love this sandwich place! They have several vegetarian options and the sandwiches are HUGE! The veggie philly cheese steak is amazing and I would eat them everyday if I could. They are fast and very friendly as well. I have been to several locations and they are consistently delicious"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what possessed me but I stopped here and tried my luck with a hot Italian...rowr.

OK it was actually a grilled Italian but didn't that sound much more interesting?  So the grilled Italian sandwich is a bunch of meat (Genoa Salami, Capacolla, Prosciutini) grilled and then folded onto a hoagie roll (Grinder for those of you from New England) with melted cheese, lettuce and other stuff.  I added grilled peppers and onions.

This is a heavy and filling sandwich.  Seriously.  And I ordered the small 7\".  I was still full 4 hours later.  It was a good sandwich and I would try Capriotti's again based on it although next time I will get something lighter like a grilled chicken or something.

I discovered when I went to write this review that Capriotti's is a chain with 25 or so locations.  The service and quality I received at this location  did not have a chain feel and I won't hold the fact that they are a chain against them...yet."}

{"text":"Capriotti's is all over the valley... There is a difference between locations... Its pretty much hit or miss...  This location is a newer spot.  My issue is, why is it so difficult to make a sandwich when the customer says NO CHEESE several times...  I make it very clear when i order,  for some reason the minions they have working at this location dont know the meaning of what it means...  No wonder these idiots have bullshit a job making sandwiches..  The best location on craig rd is the one in the home depot shopping center, they obviously care about the quality they put out and want to please their customers by getting the order right..  Avoid this spot, at all costs, they are stupid people..


Update:
I took a chance and ordered from these people again....LMAO what a bunch of dumb fuckers,,,  I was the only one in there, They made my sub in-correctly again...  They tried to scrape off the meat and place it on a new bun....  Seriously ,, this is the worse Capriotti's in the valley....  They know nothing of trying to please the customer..."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is a very popular sandwich/sub shop in Las Vegas...  I have tried several locations and i do like their food... This location however, sucks my ass.  The steak sub was not filling as they usually are at other locations.  I asked for easy on the hot peppers, well they kinda over did it, completely making the sandwich un-edible..  Perhaps the saying easy on the hots, is beyond their comprehension. Their staff, what a bunch of tools...Food may be decent but the service, to me is a key factor in eating at a restaurant even if it is just a sub shop...  I recommend Capriotti's but not this location...   Hope this yelps"}
{"text":"Love capriottis,, great subs.. this location staffed by incompetent stupid people...  3x in a row they get the order wrong... These people in here are either illiterate or touched by GOD...  Go to the other locations,, this place sucks and smells like ass and feet..."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are great but the service is terrible. I couldn't believe that the two times I come to this location they forget my order. Just my luck. These guys need to really up their game up. I'm never usually one to give a harsh review but come on staff! Step it up."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite late night place for subs. In recent months customer service had went down hill. No personality, no smiles, always grumpy. I went there at 3:25 am, even the sign said they were open. I tried to open the door and it was lock. The two guys in there, behind the counter, look up and smirks indicating they were closed. How can they be closed when they are suppose to be open 24/7 and the sign said they are open? Will not be coming to this location again!"}

While eating the absolutely amazing home cooked turkey sandwich with every bite I took, I pondered about that statement. It probably is true."}

{"text":"Solid sandwich shop. I ordered the homemade, slow roasted brown roast beef sandwich on white with everything on it. I can compare this sandwich to the ones made at Whole Foods. For the same price Whole Foods wins on weight. If I go to Aiello's my roast beef is pink. However I enjoyed my meal. $5."}

{"text":"I live around the corner from this franchise, and simply don't understand the negative reviews here. I always go for the sliced bread turkey sandwich for $5, and it's a good deal for an excellent, freshly roasted sandwich. The staff is mostly teens and your 20-something's, so they aren't the most efficient or professional crew in the world. But it's a sandwich shop in a strip mall... They are polite, make good sandwiches, and and reasonably priced. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sandwich place! The portions are generous. My favorite is called the Bobbie. It has turkey which is real sliced turkey not processed. It also has stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo. It's Thanksgiving on a roll! Totally takes care of my Thanksgiving dinner craving when it's not November! I also love the Capistrami! It has pastrami, coleslaw, cheese, Russian dressing and mayo. So good!"}
{"text":"If you're a tourist like me visiting Sin City then I highly recommend you try this place! 

I was introduced to Capriotti's by my girlfriend who kept raving about this place and I trusted her word since she use to be a local in Nevada. Well I can honestly say she's made me a fan!! 

I tried \"The Bobbie\" which is your whole thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich. All you're hopes and dreams will come true after sinking your teeth into this heavenly creation. Well maybe not but that's how I felt after my first bite lol. I was expecting a warm toasty sandwich but instead it was cold to my surprise! Nonetheless it was still delicious. But if you want it served warm then you need to request that so just FYI if you want it served warm. Thanks for that tip Michael D.

All the ingredients in this sandwich include homemade turkey, cranberry, stuffing, and mayo. 

When I eat a sandwich and its served on a sub roll the bread can be a bit much but I have to say the bread they use here is by far thee best I've ever had! It's very soft, fresh, and pillowy. Trust me you will love it! 

I ordered a small and when I got it I was surprised at how big it was! Well for me it was but what a deal at $7.29 I'd say it's well worth it. 

I shared my other half with my friend as she ordered the Slaw Be Jo and it gave me a chance to try 2 different sandwiches. This sandwich has homemade roast beef, provolone cheese, russian dressing, mayo, and coleslaw which I'm not a fan of but I was willing to give it a try. The outcome? It was pretty good! The cole slaw wasn't too sweet and I liked how it added a crunch to the sandwich. The roast beef was delicious as well. 

I can't wait to go back and try The Bobbie warm next time. They do have locations in Cali so I'm super excited about that. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I always LOVE Eating at Capriotti's as a little treat for myself from time to time. Just today I ordered the pastrami sandwich. It's one of their hot subs, with pastrami coleslaw and an amazing sauce. I'd recommend you try it if you haven't yet. Order a medium. I've made the mistake of getting large before and I walked out of their with a gigantic sub big enough to feed 4 people LOL"}
{"text":"First time here and it was really good. I ordered the bobbie sandwich since I hear everyone raving about it. It was ok. Not my favorite. Place is really clean and wasn't busy at all for lunch around 1130. I like going to a place where I can get in and get out. Staff was really friendly. They gave me this punch card.. buy 10 get the 11th free. Very nice. About the same prices as subway so I wasn't upset. Plus the sizes of food are definitely moneys worth. At least I think. For anyone in the Chandler area, this is definitely a place to stop in and try."}

{"text":"Cap's has really good signature subs that are simple and delicious.  Be sure to try \"The Bobbie\" - Homemade Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing, and Mayo.  The turkey tastes fresh and the cranberry sauce tastes like homemade.  

Another favorite is the Capastrami - Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw.

Bread is sometimes too carby for me so I ask them to pick out some so it's not too heavy.  Sandwiches are great for take out for eating later and big enough for sharing."}
{"text":"This sandwich shop holds up to the hype.... It's basically a high end deli sandwich shop with subway prices. If they put one of these up next to Subways they would shut them down with in a month every time guaranteed. I got the home made turkey and I was pleasantly surprised that the turkey wasn't processed, it was freshly pulled turkey right off the turkey... So it's healthy as well. Crazy... I don't know how their so cheep. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. LOVE this place. I always get the cheese steak sandwich. It's a must. If you like hot food, definitely get it with hot peppers. Its spicy but the perfect kick."}
{"text":"They're everywhere so I never really paid too much attention to it.  I tried it at Red Rock Casino after a good hike and damn have I been missing out!  Tried the Philly Cheese and it straight hit the spot and then I convinced myself maybe it was because I was just really hungry, reason why it tasted so good so I tried it again a week later but this time it was the MeatBall sub......damn exact same reaction, like the best fight scene action in my tummy ain't no lie like some bad actin', so good got me rappin like 2short about hoes and ass smackin' not selfish in packin' buns with meat, so if you ready to eat, get off your feet and head to Capriotti's cuz they got different subs for everybody!

Yea it's that good but prepare to pay above of what you normally pay for at Subway.  And oh they deliver too. Well where I'm from (SW Vegas) they do."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service and a solid sandwich. Had the Bobbie, the turkey & stuffing sandwich. It had real (not lunch meat) turkey, decent stuffing, and a cranberry sauce. Earl of Sandwich has something like this, seasonally, that I remember being much tastier. I wasn't wowed, but it was a decent place that I'd go back to and try something else."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches that I have ever got! How can you not like a sandwich from here. So good, so cheap, so delicious. 

My favorites are: 
-The Bobbie. A lot of people seemed to rave about this one. Who doesn't want Thanksgiving Dinner in a Sandwich. So good. The stuffing, the cranberry, the turkey all in one bite! Can't say no to that! You won't get disappointed.
-Capastrami. So good! I always order this too. Hot Pastrami and cheese and cole slaw. The sandwich is a bit messy, but most foods that are messy are delicious!

Give these two sandwiches a try and you won't be disappointed. One of the places you just have to h it up during Vegas! They're all over Vegas too. Well more in the local casinos. If it wasn't for my boyfriend, I would have never found out about this place! SO GOOD."}
{"text":"This new location is perfect for those working near Nellis AFB! As I was driving somewhere else to eat, I saw that the new location was open. My friend and I immediately decided to change dinner plans! Capriotti's is a sandwich shop doing things right! Best sandwich on the menu is the Bobbie! It is thanksgiving in a sandwich...including turkey, cranberries, and stuffing. How awesome is it to be able to get the day-after-thanksgiving sandwich 24/7?! Yes, 24/7... The sandwich shop is you average sandwich place, but the Bobbie 24/7 makes this place a 4! 

Highly recommend trying this place....the chocolate chip cookie dough brownies are pretty perfect, too!"}
{"text":"This is a travesty! How does this fine establishment not have 5 stars?

I'm also not happy with this whole Bobbie obsession. Yes, the Bobbie is amazing. I will not dispute this. However, the unsung hero of this menu is the Cole-Turkey. You can disagree with me but you'd be wrong since this is my review. 

Turkey, Provolone, Thousand Island, and Coleslaw = Delicious!

What? Are you going to go to Subway? That place smells like an actual Subway. Quizno's? Pshhh... their bread may as well be cement. These guys have the formula down. The bread is awesome, they hand pull roasted turkey (I've seen them doing it in the back) and everything moves quick so it's nice and fresh.

All those who oppose this gem of a sandwich shop are only dishonoring yourselves and your entire family."}
{"text":"The Bobbie is my new favorite sandwich.  I usually have the chicken cheese steak or Slaw Be Jo. Even this was cold it was really good!  I'll definitely go back for more! I ordered a small and it was huge!"}
{"text":"I usually don't complain about this place. But I expect their standard to be kept up with their high prices. I ordered to pick up. When I got there my order wasn't even started and they let me watch them scrape my soup from the bottom of the soup kettle barely enough to fill my soup cup 3/4 of the way full for 5.99 and it was cold. All of this while I watched them pull a frozen plastic bag of \"fresh\" clam chowder to put on the stove in a pot of hot water. For the prices I thought this place had a little higher standards then let's say the drive thrus but not after what I saw today!"}
{"text":"This place is ah-mazing! I had the regular turkey sandwich and added cole-slaw. The turkey!? Well it's better than your mamas thanksgiving turkey-it's darn good. I'll be frequenting this place from now on!"}
{"text":"Best philly steak n cheese in town. period!"}
{"text":"This Capriotti's is a very well run location. I never have any issues whatsoever. They are quick, courteous and professional. I love their cheesesteaks, but their turkey is also really good. Plus, they carry Wise chips! They are typically hard to find in this town, unless you go here or the Bagel Cafe. They are my favorite chips from back when I lived in New York. The honey barbecue are awesome! If you like Capriotti's, this is definitely a solid location."}
{"text":"Capriotti's has some great sandwiches... the best is the capistromi; the medium is really big."}
{"text":"Didn't try the Bobbie, but have had a couple other sandwiches from here and they are good, but nothing out of this world. They guy at checkout doesn't seem like a people person and sounds annoyed calling your name when your order is ready. Would eat here again if really hungry and there weren't other convenient options."}
{"text":"Being from the Philadelphia  I feel like it's so hard to be satisfied with any hoagie type sandwiches out here. This place definitely more than satisfies! While their cheesesteak is definitely not a Philly cheesesteak it's a great sandwich that I would order again. I have to say the cole turkey sandwich is my favorite though. I crave that regularly. I can't wait to try more sandwiches and am very happy with how close this location is!"}
{"text":"I walked into this location and there was one person there waiting for a sandwich. I was blatantly ignored by the two gentlemen working their even after they made eye contact with me.  Shame on you guys."}
{"text":"I've been to Capriott's  on Eastern Avenue twice in two months. I go there just to get Wise Potatoe Chips.The first time I was there I gave the Kid behind the counter the correct amount of money for the Chips that I bought and this time again the same response,Oh! no beer money??Im assuming he didn't like it that I didn't give him a tip! What for? I didn't have him make me a sandwich or anything else.I simply bought Wise Potatoe Chips.Im a Bartender and when my customers want water or anything else I give it to them ,ring in the amount of the purchase  and if they leave me a tip find and if they don't that's fine too! I just thought that was so damn rude that I had to write this because it really pissed me off! Will I go ther again? No."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years just because I live across the street. The service here is horrible and the employees are definitely high! I wish there was a location closer cause I do like the food. My rating is based only on service."}
{"text":"Unique menu options, great location, friendly staff. I grew up eating hoagies from mom and pop delis on the east coast, so I'm extremely spoiled when it comes to sandwich shops, but Capriotti's is a solid choice. Go for the Bobbie, Slaw Be Jo, or the Cole Turkey.

The service is very good. I've been here probably 30 times over the past year and maybe 2 of those visits took a little longer when they were training a new employee, but the vast majority of the time, this place comes through, so don't put much weight in the negative reviews from people who had one bad experience and never returned - in statistics, sample size matters!"}
{"text":"Tried the cranberry and turkey sandwich with stuffing and it was pretty good. For someone who doesn't love the cranberry turkey combo, I was definitely converted off this sandwich.

Will return!"}
{"text":"Really great sand which at a great price. I'd recommend the meatball or the slaw be j, but I'm sure they're all good."}
{"text":"This sqndwich will change your life. The bobby is a sandwich that totally rocked my face off. They use thankgiving style shredded turkey. You know like if you have leftovers and shred it up and make sandwiches. They are like that so thats really a big difference. Then they add stuffing cranberry sauce and mayo. Its thanksgiving on a bun and it kicks ass. Then the bread is fresh and really good too. 
Now truth me told this thing is the densist sandwich you will ever eat. It sits in your stomach like a friggin brick but my god is it amazing. The prices arent bad and boy will you be full."}
{"text":"We have been to this place on two separate occasions. First was due to the ratings on here so we thought we would try it out.

But when we got there the people were rude sloppy and in a hurry, yet there was only myself and another customer.

I was thinking we just hit it on the wrong day, so we went back again for another try.

The second time was even worse. The kid behind the counter wasn't even interested in taking our order so we ended up leaving and going somewhere else.

I'm not thinking we will try again or recommend this place to anyone.

The staff just seems to be to irresponsible and just interested in their paycheck not their customer service."}
{"text":"Well again I must warn I have high standards for subs . These are clean & fresh and not bad, much better than subway which literally smells like swill to me. So if I could rate 2 1/2 stars I would.
 The counter people are ok, not bad, not good.. they do their job. 
 Steak and cheese is kind of bland... extras are expensive (mushrooms etc). Also did he order wrong or do they not have pickles?! Isn't the point of ordering out NOT to have to do any cooking or adding of your own pickles from your fridge?! The meatballs are ok.
 Lots of bread, I wouldn't go so far as to say they are skimpy because they aren't but there is something missing to me... maybe it's veggies.. or sauce,... Dunno... I hated their idea of roast beef... we have been here a few times over the years, never a bad experience just never a great one either."}
{"text":"Stopped in during a recent visit to Vegas for Superbowl weekend. I gotta say I was impressed. I had the small (9') I think it was meatball and it was bigger than most foot longs that you would get at Subway or whatever. Another thing, is these were all solid sandwiches, not like Subway where the thing is mostly lettuce and very little meat and cheese.  The meatball and sauce was tasty and the bread was nice and soft. Yeah this place is a lil pricey but you get what you pay for. This one was conveniently Located directly across from the Hard Rock where we were staying but I guess they have them all over the greater Las Vegas area. Oh, the one bad thing is it was kind of a wait so don't go here if you're in a  rush.."}
{"text":"Bobbie wasn't as good here as other locations. Bobbie with slaw was gross... Sloppy, wet, soggy, gross."}
{"text":"My co-workers decided to do a lunch run to Capriottis. I was excited because this would be my first time trying the highly praised sandwich shop that so many have told me about. When I first moved to Vegas, whenever I told someone I had never tried Capriottis before they would give me a \" get out of this room right now and go order a sandwich\" look. So, I can say I was pretty happy to finally bid that look goodbye.

I decided to try something I knew I'd enjoy first, before trying their \"known\" sandwiches because I did not feel like much of a risk taker that day. I opted to go with the 9 inch meatball sub. The meatball sub includes both romano and provolone cheese and marinara sauce. Simple, but delicious. The meatballs did not taste processed or fake at all. In fact, they had a great \"homemade\" taste to them that I thoroughly enjoyed. The sub filled me up and I was full until dinner time!

Next time I'm planning on trying the Bobbie. One of my co-workers ordered it and I was so tempted to switch sandwiches for even just one bite. It looked that good."}
{"text":"Way better than subway and port of subs. The capistrami is the best! Their Bobby sandwhich would be awesome if you could add gravy! (hint, hint)"}
{"text":"all sandwiches are great and so is the staff, and the place is very clean, buy a deal 
on double takes.  THE BEST SANDWICHES."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwhiches. I usually get the Capastrami and/or The Bobbie. I'd choose this place over Subway or Quiznos any day. A little more pricey, but welll worth it my opinon. Lunch hours can get busy. Therefore call in your order ahead of time."}
{"text":"The big deal with Capriotti's is the turkey.  It's pulled roast turkey, not cold cuts.  The other crucial component to their sandwiches is they have pretty substantial rolls.  So here's the rundown of what I've had. 

The Bobbie: Turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce--cold.  It's an interesting combo, but kinda works.  I was sucked in by this gimmick.  I've eaten a few.  I like them.  

Grilled Italian: Genoa salami, capicola ham, prosciuttini (peppered ham) & provolone; grilled.  Dang tasty if you're looking for some greasy deliciousness.  Especially w/ hot peppers.  You can also get this as a cold sub if you prefer. 

Cheese steak: This one is kinda meh.  Not very great.  If you really want a proper cheese steak then go to Big Red's downtown.

Turkey sub: To me, this is the real standout.  Pulled roast turkey, provolone, \"seasonings,\" and whatever other veggies.  I like mine with no onions, add mayo, pickles & hot peppers.  Oh boy.  Delicious.  I can eat a 12\" and then feel ready to eat the whole thing again.

Having gotten to the turkey sub, I'm pretty much sticking with it.  I might try something else at some point but right now I'm kind of hooked on the turkey. 

Their one final gimmick is that a 12\" sub is a medium  A large is 20\".  I could almost eat a 20\" turkey by myself.  I might just do it in a moment of weakness. 

The owners of the Cousins franchise around the corner should be a bit worried."}
{"text":"i long to go back to vegas just for the pastrami !! this place is delcious!

The Bobbie: it is delicious and taste like a fresh sandwich should! very good and worth every penny
The capastrami: the best pastrami sandwhich i have ever had, the meat is not too salty ,and its flavored just right to be deliciously delicious! cant go wrogn with this thng!!

the restaurant: its alright, i dont like eating here too much, its just too much hassle for me, i like it even though its clean and all, but it gets busy really quick.

the service:
nice people, but i will say that they take a good while on your sandwich whether its busy or not, come hungry but dont expect to eat for a good 15 minutes when you walk in here. 

a must have in vegas!"}
{"text":"I came here from the recommendation of a friend. The food didn't dissapoint! I ordered the Italian Sausage sub and it was everything I hoped it would be! HUGE, delicious subs. The only knock I had was the sub-par costumer service. They seemed annoyed we were there, and it showed. We were rushed very un graciously out the door. I'm excited to go at a different time and see if I don't recurve better service."}
{"text":"It's every bit the same sandwich shop as the other locations albeit in a gas station. The sandwiches are the same (amazing) and the service is quick. I've had most of the sandwiches and the Capistrami and cheesesteak are my favorites hands down. Only get knocked a star because they forgot a sandwich on our order. Haven't tried it? Do it! It's pretty incredible. Side note: the hours are not 24, I think they close at 11pm."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE. My sandwich was so disgusting I threw it away. The sandwiches are sloppy and the cooks take so long to make them. Absolutely disgusting. The meat is all dark and the bread was not good. WORST QUALITY. DO NOT EAT HERE"}
{"text":"Service is reasonable. But the food is barely edible, a common theme with all Capriotti's."}
{"text":"First I want to say they are polite and efficient. My problem is I have the app and used it to order and pay for the first time. I opened it and it said you have a reward of a medium drink and small chips with the purchase of a sub. It went smooth and easy. Went in to pick up and asked to redeem the reward but was told you can't unless you pay there. Really? No where on the app does it say that. They said to go ahead and take it but I declined because i didn't  want anyone to get in trouble. I think they need to improve the way the app and stores work together. I will probably not use the app again."}
{"text":"Gonna sound like a teen girl but.... OMG!! I thought Fire House was good till I ate here. This place is the shizznit. Capastami is so good. Some of the best pastrami I've ever had and the Russian dressing and cole slaw were so good in combo with it. Every once in a while you have a sub bun that makes you realize you'll never be successful on the low carb diet.. this one did just that! Funny I actually tried their veggie turkey (what?) because my girls friend was with and she is a vegetarian (annoying!) and their \"fake\" turkey was even good! 4.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Favorite sandwich shop in the valley!

Must try the bobbie!  I get it in the 20\" variety every time I go"}
{"text":"Not a great experience. Service was slow, order was wrong. I didn't feel like complaining until it actually tasted bad. It was the staff the day I was in there, looked high, or tired. That would explain the difficulties completing the task of making a sandwich."}
{"text":"Really good sandwiches, the bread is fresh, the meat tender, and the spicy peppers will kick up any sandwich. I will continue to eat here, it taste like a great New York Deli sandwich and not like the other sandwich shops with the gross meat that taste wet."}
{"text":"BY FAR THE BEST SANDWICH IN LAS VEGAS.  

I've been coming here for years and haven't gotten around to a review.  I've had the Bobby, Capastomi and the Cheesesteak Philly but today I went with the Meatball. 

This place is always on point and tasty.  The employees are always friendly and make a great meal."}
{"text":"Simply put.., Cappriotti's is Tha' Bomb!!! The Bobbie Rocks!!!! Always live their food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti's But this particular location was not good.
The bread was dry. It was lacking on the stuffing in the sandwich. We paid $25 for a half a sandwich and soup and a medium sandwich. Wow not like the one in red rock for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service at counter.
didn't notice her name but she was an African-American girl. Sweetheart.
Veggie Turkey Sandwich was the bomb. 
I have never had a bad sandwich at caps!"}
{"text":"Upon first entering, place seems unclean.. ordered anyhow after waiting about 10 min to be waited on... Went to restroom to wash my hands.. who knows the last time the sink/basin was cleaned! Observed shredded turkey sitting in a large tray exposed to the air - didn't look so great. Waited about 15 min for my food (chicken cheesesteak) - tasted good but amount of chicken was a bit skimpy.  Won't come back here due to uncleanliness and slow, not friendly service."}
{"text":"Great quick inexpensive option while at the Red Rock Resort.
We split their smallest Philly Cheese steak and it was enough for two for sure.
Filled with finely shaved nicely flavored meat and tons of melted cheese.
We liked it alot.
check it out!"}
{"text":"The food is good at all locations and the service is consistently a 3-4 star however this location is on their stuff!  Very enthusiastic staff,  polite and fast, best service I've had at any Capriotti's! Thank you for the fast pick up and great food! Cheers"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place last after hearing great things about it. We ordered a sandwich and a salad. After waiting a while we noticed a few people that ordered food after us received there food. My boyfriend went up to the cashier to ask when our food was going to be ready. One of the guys making sandwiches snapped at him saying it takes 15-20 minutes. He came back to the table and We looked at the receipt for the time and it had been 17 minutes. I noticed the two guys pointing a us and giving us dirty looks. I figured we give them a little more time and give them benifit. after watching a few more people get there order I walked up there to find out what was going on since it had been almost a half hour. The cashier apologized again and again saying our order was lost to give them 5 more minutes. We told him we were tired of waiting it shouldn't take 30 minutes to make a sandwich we just wanted our money back. He understood and kept apologizing while refunding our money. He was super nice and felt horrible. The other two, not so much instead of trying to get our order ready they stood there giving us dirty looks. Very disappointed in this place and will never go back."}
{"text":"Ordered a \"pick two\" with the meatball sandwich and balsamic chicken salad. Hubby got a medium cheesteak with sweet peppers. Sandwiches are huge, but I'd rather have Subway for the price. More expensive and the flavors were just \"meh.\" Employees were friendly but nothing more. Unimpressed by the whole experience really."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS SANDWICHES - CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK AND HAVE ANOTHER.

So I'm not from Vegas but my bf currently lives there. I have a favorite sandwich shop back at home, Little Luca's in the Bay Area (pastrami with cheese on Dutch crunch roll mmmmmm), and I have to say that this place is a new favorite. 

1) Food: I've only tried the Capastrami and Cheese Steak hot subs. Both sandwiches were MOIST, but not drenched with sauce. The pastrami meat was soft and not stringy like how it can be elsewhere. The cheese steak meat was also soft and gawd so yummy.  HOW DOES THE SANDWICH STAY WARM THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE TIME I AM EATING IT???  That's what I distinctly remember. The sandwich is ~$10... and like 20 inches long or something. I may be over-exaggerating that part but alls I remember is that it was a LARGE SANDWICH and I DEVOURED THAT THING, no problem.  And I'm a petite female if I may add that.

2) Dining & Take out: Plenty of tables to sit at and eat the sandwich.  No qualms about the to-go sandwich. Tasted just as warm and fresh as if I were eating it there, but then again I only had to drive a few blocks to get home. 

3) Parking: Went here for lunch - no problem finding parking. More trouble finding parking at night when I ordered it to go. 

Bottom line: If you're looking for a DELICIOUS, mouth-watering, WARM, MOIST sandwich, then I most-def RECOMMEND this place. Don't go to Vegas and not try it!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich's. Super fast delivery fresh ingredients what's not to like I recommend the home made turkey you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Food is great. Location does not have wifi so nothing really works in this plaza.

This location was dirty and poorly maintained for a newer location in Downtown Summerlin."}
{"text":"This one is a very good shop! Of like 4-5, that I've tried. Fast service, friendly guys. I like the way they make my Fav, Ham and provolone with everything and their sweet cherry peppers..I actually also tried (off the menu) the Capicola and provolone same way! Very clean place. Great atmosphere too. Keep up the good work, love your ingredients with deli thin slices."}
{"text":"The best, the best...still the best!!!  This one is my Go To, though I've tried them all over town and in Henderson too! You guys are the bomb..my favorite one here is the Ham with provolone..all the way, with the sweet peppers, not the hot...and I sometimes crave (off their menu) the Capicola and provolone. Keep up the great work guys, love you're ingredients and the bread...If I could eat here everyday, I would...its addicting for sure"}
{"text":"After venturing down the north side of the strip and westbound on Sahara in order to give Capriotti's a try for the first time....... I found that it was closed for renovations....bah....
Then today while visiting the Hard Rock hotel, I clicked on yelp and found there was one across the street. 
I walked over and Yesssss! It's open. 
I looked at the menu and picked The Bobbie.
It read\"Best Sandwich in America\"
 
I dunno...I've had Seattle's Paseo and Un Bien's Caribbean Press sandwich 
I'd rank this sandwich somewhere in the top 10
It was pretty good.
Great friendly fast service
A little away from the strip so hopefully the Sahara one will be up and running the next time I visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Had the meatball and Cheeses Steak,,very good will be back to try the pulled  turkey !!!"}
{"text":"I love thanksgiving and Capriotti's has the ultimate thanksgiving sandwich, the Bobbie!  It is amazing.  I visited various places around the valley with different turkey/stuffing/cranberry sauce sandwiches and none could beat capriottis!!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's deserves special accolades for offering three very legitimate vegetarian options. I am not talking about a salad on a loaf. No, they offer much more than that. They have fake meat! To be specific, you can get a vegetarian turkey, cheesesteak or hamburger. I find this astounding and convenient especially here in Las Vegas where the closest thing to vegetarian is often cranberry and vodka. Blech.

Ran into my neighborhood Capriotti's today to grab a sandwich. For a chain, they are really lacking in a cohesive design. Pretty much every Capriotti's I have visited looks terrible. My neighborhood location has several glass-enclosed bulletin boards, and while waiting for my sandwich, I was noticing that every one had a section of USA today tacked up. I am sure there is an explanation for this, but as a casual observer it seemed random.

Service was quick and friendly. I walked out with a 12-inch vegetarian turkey sub with everything except cheese and mayo. Capriotti's loses some sub-cred by not offering a selection of breads and for closing at like 7pm on the weekdays in my hood. However, they do white, soft bread rather well, and they regain some cred by having really flavorful peppers. I think the peppers make the sandwich. The fake meat must be decent because my taste buds had no complaints. Then again, perhaps they were distracted by the peppers. Either way, Capriotti's is fine by me, and I think they are quite a find for a vegetarian in need of a quick meal."}
{"text":"I dont think ive ever left a negative reveiw. I dont like to.
That being said i feel obligated to. I was there yesterday for lunch. The tough guy in charge was not a gentleman at all. He was condiscening towards the other employee's. 
I immediately thought the other guy there had mesed something up. It made perfect sense for that to be the explanation.
I felt the employee was acting suspicious, very slow, maybe tired. 
I gave the tough guy the benefit of the doubt for the moment. That was until i had grown inpatient waiting for my sandwhich. I asked if it was finnished. The tough guy poked in and said its been waiting. (Ive been waiting) being nice i just said \"oh i didnt hear\" i was only trying to hint that they need to anounce the order. I didnt feel i was being passive agressive. After my reply, he responded \"cant see?\" Under his breath as he was walking away. 
That behaviour is unacceptable. Im probabaly younger then him, and even i dont respond to my customers like that. 
Id love to eat there, when he isnt present. Im glad he is normally tucked away, whenever im there. But now im not sure if ill ever be back. I cant stand being talked to like a child. I Believe respect is a two way road, i dont know what this guy was thinking."}
{"text":"Where do I start. The Bobby sandwich is excellent.  There service is great always friendly and the wait time is 10-15 minutes top. I was so happy to find out that's there's another location in Green Valley Casino which is very close to our house."}
{"text":"Fantastic Vegetarian Turkey sandwich. Unreal. Better than turkey itself. Only problem was wait time to order one sandwich. Otherwise great stuff. Looking forward to trying out the other sandwiches' vegetarian style!"}
{"text":"Cranberry in a sandwich? Small sized sandwich really that big??!!

My friends love this place and it was my first time here.  I wasn't sure how cranberry would taste in a sandwich so I was interested in trying it out.  I got the cran slam which had turkey, cran, ham, lettuce, mayo on it.  You get to pick between white and wheat bread.  You pay when the order comes out.  I was shocked how big a small was.  it's like a footlong!

The sandwich itself had a different taste to it, but it was good.  Not sure how to describe it but it tasted like a mesh of food blended together.  

When we were there they had free coffee.  Just what I needed.."}
{"text":"This is prob the best place to get a sandwich they have the Bobbie whickever my wife gets a thanksgiving dinner in every bite... I am a fan of the cappastromie it is super delicious!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first visit to ANY Capriotti's and let me tell you that I was very pleased. I am not quite an expert on what kind of sandwiches there are out there. So when I went there I was already thrown off by the numerous options. It took me a while but I ended up going with the New York Style Cheese Steak. It wasn't the first time that I have heard of this sandwich and I've heard good things. It lived up to it's expectation. I also ended up putting some Jalapeno Chips into the sandwich to give it a nice crunch and zest. Also did not let me down.

Now, I've Vegan you see, and the only reason I ate here was because I was really hungry and my roommate offered. I can't turn down free food. :) I will definitely be here again. I must try some other sandwiches. Also, I got a free juice box :)"}
{"text":"If you read any of my other reviews, you'll see that I NEVER issue a single star, ever. I see no reason, well saw no reason. Until today. 

 This sucks because I am a huge fan of Capriotti's and always order in Henderson, back near the house. This placed failed me over the phone, before I ever stepped foot in the door.

 Being Sunday in Boulder City, you have to be Jesus himself to get food. We work in Boulder and have resorted to Yelp over and over to find food because you can only eat so much Milo's and Coffee Cup. Today we wanted sandwiches and as I had my special guest star Ryley (7 year old daughter) with me a grilled cheese was in order. 

 I called down there and got a pleasant enough sounding guy on the phone and I explained I needed to place an order to pick up. Immediate confusion. I explained we would come get it. He asked what I wanted and I asked if they had a kid's grilled cheese. He said no. Oddly enough I had ordered a grilled cheese here previously so I thought he was being a smart ass. No such luck. He further explained he wasn't \"trained\" to make a grilled cheese. He didn't have the qualifictions. WTF? It's a grilled cheese, for God's sake, my chihuahua can make one. No thumbs people, just good training.

 He offered me a cold cheese sandwich. No problem, I have a toaster oven at work, I'll handle the brain surgery my damn self. After I explain in great detail the rest of my order I tell him it will be under the name Travis. This really kicked his ass. My 976 voice was completely removed from his head when I threw out Travis. I guess it's hotter to get your head around \"Bambi\" chowing down three sandwiches than to think someone else was picking them up.

Travis went and picked up the sandwiches and came back to work. We sit down to eat and yeah . . . .  you guessed it. Wrong Sandwich. Oh, don't worry . . . my 5.00 components for a grilled cheese were thrown in some paper and tossed in the bag. But I didn't order the sandwhich I was given. Nice. 

We called back to the perplexed young guy and he offered to bring the right sandwich out to me. 


Straight genious. I said to myself, \"It doesn't get any better than this.\""}
{"text":"My fiance and I are from the east coast and so we have been trying to find somewhere to fill the void of Wawa and the Amorosa's rolls and Capriottis does just this.  He likes the Bobbie (leftover Thanksgiving in a sandwich) and I am in love with the Capastrami.  Deliciousness.  The text message deals don't hurt either :)"}
{"text":"There are very few vegetarian friendly sandwich shops out there, but Capriotti's is one of them. They have a handful of sandwiches made with faux meats. The sandwiches they make are also quite filling. Their small is a 9 inch sub, with a 12 inch, and an 20 inch sub rounding out the options.

Edit: I was recently informed that the faux meats that Capriotti's has are NOT vegan. Sorry if my previous review led anyone astray."}
{"text":"For a gas station this place is amazing!!! Lol! I wish I had gotten the name of the young man who helped us to tell him thank you"}
{"text":"This place could use a little freshening up...paint, hot soapy water, etc.  Ordered a cheesesteak with a \"yes\" to everything he asked about as an option.  Amazing, of course.  I've only had Capriotti's one other time at the Green Valley location but my local friend has raved about them forever.  I could seriously eat their cheesesteaks every day...so freaking good.  Give this location a little attention and it would be spot on."}
{"text":"Great customer service and my sandwich was outstanding!! It was a quick last minute stop and what a great choice! Can't wait to go back! Loved the two guys behind the counter. They greeted right away and made recommendations based on what I told them I liked and didn't like! Go try it! Amazing sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Capriotti's. I get the Capastrami everytime I come, it's simply delicious. That mountain of meat, cheese, dressing, and slaw. Oh and don't let me forget they have 20 inch subs. Yes that's 20 inches of deliciousness. Now overall I would give all other Capriotti's locations a 5 stars no question about it but I have had nothing but problems with THIS LOCATION the three times I have been here. The problems I have had everytime has been either with delivery or calling in my order for pickup.

First experience: I found out they delivered so I ordered a 20 inch Capastrami with some other items for delivery to my apartment via their app at 6pm. The app said it would take about an hour and a half to get there, extremely long. I called the store out of curiosity about 20 minutes after placing my order just to verify everything. I get told they are not currently delivering as no one there owns a car, they deliver only from 12-4pm, and they did not recieve my order period. So why did the app let me order? That's an error on the owners behalf. If I didn't call the food would of never shown up without any notice. Seems like amatuer work to me. So I drive to the store and get my food. I arrive home and there is a delivery guy knocking on my door. Amatuer work at it's finest and terrible communication.

Second experience: I was at work and decided I would buy lunch for me and my partner as he has never had Capriotti's. I call and order a 20 inch Capastrami once again. The woman on the phone tells me I have to order over $30 for delivery. I don't know anywhere else that requires that much for a minimum. I tell her I didn't order $30 worth of items last week and got delivery to my apartment. She told me they don't deliver to apartments and basically called me a liar with her bitchy attitude. I asked to speak to her manager. A split second later she is back trying to disguise her voice. There is no professionalism with this staff. I hung up to prevent myself from saying some evil shit.

Third experience: I order food for pickup and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes. So I drive there expecting my food to be ready just to find out they had not even started my order. I waited 20 more minutes just for the food. What is the point in taking orders if they will not be ready. 

It sucks because this location does make it's sandwiches good which is the only reason it still got 3 stars and the guy who makes the subs is great. The rest of the staff is shit and needs to get trained on their systems. GET ON IT FRANCHISEE OWNER.

I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I've become a bit addicted to the Bobbie sandwich. The Bobbie has turkey, cranberries and stuffing. I've had it a few times and it's just fantastic. Almost like the sandwich you make the day after thanksgiving. I did have an issue with the amount of mayo they slabbed on once, but usually it's pretty perfect."}
{"text":"I probably eat here once a month and always order the Cran Slam Club.  It's probably my favorite sandwich from any sandwich shop.

I knock my rating from 5 to 4 stars because my wife refuses to eat here.  Every time she'd eat here with me they'd mess up her order as the person at the cash register wasn't very good at listening."}
{"text":"It had been a while since I'd been to Capriottis, which I've usually enjoyed. Never been to this location, but was Jonesing for a hoagie after some tests at St Joes. What a disappointment.
I couldn't walk well, so KT handled the ordering process etc as I parked at a table. She got the house roast beef sandwich; I went with the Italian hoagie. 
Now, KT doesn't have my hoagie background, so she didn't find it too odd when my sandwich came out with two giant slabs of lunchmeat laid across the top of the sandwich! Yes, atop the lettuce, tomato etc were two slabs of lunchmeat. My guess is the sandwich maker realized she omitted an ingredient, so just added it.
Had I felt up to it I'd have brought it back, but pain and pre-test fasting got the better of me. I rearranged things as best I could, noticing the absence of almost any dressings, oil, etc. One taste confirmed that. The menu specs what dressings you get, then charges for \"Extra\". Apparently, \"extra\" is \"some\".
KT sandwich was properly assembled, but lacked dressing and flavor.
One last comment: the flavored iced tea was simply among the worst things I've ever tasted. Seemed days old. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Ive always been curious about this place, i love a good sandwich. Didnt find one here. Small menu for a sandwich shop. Super expensive for the product. 9\" cheese steak chips and small drink $14. Shouldnt leave hungry for that price. Service was good and thats the 2 stars. Spend that at 5 Guys across lot and pig out. Yes, I know, I am a pig. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"This is a simple sandwich shop chain I'd wish to see all over Northern California!  

The Bobbie, their most popular sandwich, is not your average turkey sandwich.  With slow roasted turkey, fresh cranberry sauce, a layer of homemade stuffing, and mayo....it's like experiencing Thanksgiving anytime of the year!  One of my favorite cold sandwiches on earth.   

The Capastrami, their 2nd most popular sandwich, is packed with flavor!  I'm a huge fan of hot pastrami and this pastrami was damn good!  But I wish they had less coleslaw in the sandwich to accomodate more meat.  

Their enormous subs and quick and friendly service will expedite my return!  Gotta try the others I've heard so much about...the Capacolla and the Cheese Steak."}
{"text":"Wow.  Those were good sandwiches.  We so were not expecting that.

Wanted a quick bite to eat and neither one of us had been to a Capriotti's before.  We had a small \"Bobbie\" (tastes like Thanksgiving dinner all in one bite) and a small Italian (lots of good meats on that).

We were very pleased and both had commented that we'd remember Capriotti's.

Located in the food court in the Green Valley Ranch Resort."}
{"text":"I love Capriotti but I don't love this location..every time I go there they say the oven is broken. They recommended me to go to there other location near Hard Rock Casino. Which I couldn't do because I had to ride a bus 35 mins to get there.it took at least 25 mins by bus to get to this location"}
{"text":"Yum! Our to go sandwich shop every time we first get into Vegas. The sandwiches are so humongous and delicious.  If you think Earls is good, this place is way better!  The employee there are super nice and will give you what you need.  I love this place every time I come to Vegas! Makes for great leftover for midnight snacking:)"}
{"text":"The subs here are delicious! I got the firecracker turkey with mayo and regular mustard and it was heaven. Also got a brownie. Sooo good. I don't normally eat subs but this was not your typical sub. Most people like subway and I cannot stand them. Also, employees were all so nice."}
{"text":"The hype is real. Is this worth a $20 cab ride from the strip? Come on, it's just a sandwich. Let's not go crazy here... That being said, if you have a car/friend/etc, this place is incredible. 

What makes it so special? You know that slimy deli turkey meat stuff they serve at subway and well almost everywhere? They don't use that here.. they use real turkey that tastes like leftovers from thanksgiving. As everyone says, the bobbie really is thanksgiving on a bun. I thought stuffing, cranberry, and turkey would be kind of sick, but honestly it's incredible and you must try it. If you're looking for a sandwich place that's different than your everyday deli meat place, try here. The Cran Slam Club is also incredible (if you have a fear of stuffing or feel it doesn't belong on a sandwich), as is the cheesesteak if you're some freak that doesn't like thanksgiving turkey."}
{"text":"I'm so pleased GVR finally got with the program and put one of these in the food court last year! I love that while this is in a food court, it's just as good as any of their free standing locations. The Bobbie is special and one of my favorite guilty pleasures in this world. I hate stuffing, cranberry sauce, mayo, and turkey (in fact I hate Thanksgiving!), but somehow I love this sandwich!!"}
{"text":"Three cheers for the Capastrami!!!  Location is a bit tough to get to but if you're already in town square it's no big deal."}
{"text":"Great cheese steak  yummy, I wish they serve fries too.  Some what friendly staff , like to go back for chess steak"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with my order. The fountain drinks had a really odd taste, especially the diet Dr. Pepper. Dr. Pepper is my drink of choice at a fountain machine, and it just didn't taste right here. Both the regular and diet were off. The Mountain Dew was odd as well. 

I ordered the pastrami sandwich without the slaw. For nearly $9 I was expecting something of higher quality. To be fair, pastrami is not something I usually order at a sandwich place. However, this restaurant considers it one of their specialties. The flavor was not like I'm used to and I would never order it again. 

My boyfriend got Doritos with his sandwich and they were definitely stale. He ordered the Italian sandwich and said it was okay. I didn't try it, but it looked a lot better than my sandwich. 

The workers were pleasant, but I didn't like any of the food/drink. I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"OK so I knew I was going to be taking a a trip to Vegas so I decided to yelp some great places to eat and I found this sandwich shop, I had yelped places before and went to them not having such great experiences but I kept an open mind on my way to this shop. 

I had known I was going to try the \"Bobbie\" due to all the great reviews it had gotten. I'm such a sucker for Italian sandwiches though and the smell as I walked into this place smelled of Italian sub heaven!! I resisted and told myself ....no Felicia stick with the \"Bobbie\" you have to try new things not the same ole same ole, I'm so stoked I did the \"Bobbie\" was Thanksgiving deliciousness in May and it was great!! 

I've been on a diet eating so healthy and knew I was going to be taking in many many calories when I decided to bite into this stuffing goodness but it was sooooo worth it..........haha 

The place was easy to find and it was very clean inside. The guys working were nice and I enjoyed eating there. I just wanted to keep eating and eating it smelled so good. Next time ill try my Italian type sub or maybe the \"Capastrami\"?? We will see."}
{"text":"It's great to have another option until 3am on the weekends, especially on the south side of Indian School rd. I have been a fan since they opened the location in North Scottsdale. Oddly enough this location also has a bagel shop..."}
{"text":"They claim the best sandwich in America. I'm going to agree that they are really really really good. They also deliver. The Bobbie, Cheese-steak, and the Capastrami are all crazy good!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place have a great cheese steak sandwich. Bread & meat serving is awesome & delicious. The meatball sandwich needs improvement, needs more meatball servings. Both ends of the sandwich bread is missing meatballs. Am sure they will work on it. First timers, try the cheese steak first."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.
I work across the street, and it has become the go-to spot for a lunchtime sandwich. 
There is a Subway that is actually in the plaza that I work in, but 9 out of 10 times, I'll spend the extra 10mins waiting for the lights and crossing the busy intersection, because it's that much better.
The menu of specialty sandwiches is creative and well thought out, and I especially enjoy The Bobbie, which is essentially Thanksgiving on a roll. But it's the create-your-own sandwiches that I enjoy, with a vast array of possible ingredients, the combinations are endless. The meats are all very high quality, probably Boars Head if I had to guess.
I know, I know, it's only a sandwich. And you are right, it IS only a sandwich. BUT....if we are comparing sandwiches with other sandwiches, I can sing the praises of this place all day long.
Note: I have only been to the location on Paradise. I am aware that there are other LV locations, but this review is specific to the LV location."}
{"text":"It's a sad day when they can't even make a bobby right after standing and directing them on how it should be made from over the counter. Maybe when they can listen to a order and make it correctly I will try this location again."}
{"text":"Had the turkey veggie sandwich and wifey had the veggie burger. Both were very tasty ! Need more help though. Only had two workers. Would go back,"}
{"text":"Best Capriotti's location in town. I had an issue with an order and brought it to the owner's attention. He and the store manager took care of the issue and then some. Absolutely wonderful customer service! Thank you so much! I will now always go out of my way to go to this location."}
{"text":"They advertise as \"we deliver\" but everytime I call they say \"we aren't delivering today\" 3rd time in a row! Bummer."}
{"text":"It was okay, definitely waited a little longer at this place then the one on rainbow and 215 but still wasn't as bad."}
{"text":"I only write reviews on Yelp to help people save their money.

Ten bucks for a small sandwich and a drink.  \"The Bobbie\" which is supposed to be their signature sandwich is cold shredded turkey (maybe a 2 oz portion at most) cold stove top stuffing and cold cranberry sauce smushed in a rubbery piece of bread.  No sides!  If my co worker wasn't the one who picked this up and I was eating it inside the restaurant, I would march up to the counter and ask for a refund.  

My toddler could make this better in his sleep.  

Of all the years working in Scottsdale, this is hands down, the biggest ripoff for lunch.  How they are still in business after a year is beyond me.  GARBAGE."}
{"text":"How can these sandwiches be so large and tasty?!  Also, how can I dare to eat more than half of one at a time!   Their Capastrami has put me into a semi-coma as I talk about them here.   It's delicious though, don't let the Ketamine-like coma I'm going into block that out.  

The only downside to this place is that it'll take about 6 minutes for your order to be ready when it's an empty restaurant, and even longer when it's busy.  PHONE AHEAD!  If you don't, you'll be waiting.  If you do, yay instant payoff sandwich!    The medium could be 3 meals for a normal soul, 2 for the hungry workman on a swing shift. 

I'm just going to lie down now in my cubicle and... zzz..."}
{"text":"If you've never had a Capriotti's, you've got at least one great & low-cost event left in this town of overdone 99-cent prime rubbery ribs!   Their sandwiches inhabit the opposite spectrum of that boring and lame eatery scale -- they're big, they're seriously delicious, and there's a variety so you can always try to get a new one!  Try is implied because after having your first Bobbie or Capastrami, you may not want to edge out into the equally good Italian or heart-obliterating Cheesesteak.   But you should -- if only to prove to yourself you are good at making decisions!"}
{"text":"Capriottis is awesome! They have a great menu that is a great value. I can get a Veggie burger that is delicious done the way I like in ten minutes and the price ...yes believe it its only $4.79. Honestly it is as good as veggie burgers elsewhere in town that are twice that price! If you are a vegetarian this is the lunch place for you you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I recently moved up to Washington. The only fault this place has is that they can't deliver their spicy Philly cheesesteak up to me. You know what it feels like not having that in my life anymore? Hollow. Like a child watching his balloon fly away because he forgot he was holding it. I love you Philly cheesesteak and I'll never forget you."}
{"text":"OK, finally made my first trip into a Capriotti's, and I have to say, I'm impressed.  I'm from NJ originally so my standards for Cheesesteak sandwiches are pretty high and that is the only reason it gets a 4, instead of a 5.  The shop was clean, well staffed and though there was a line I was on my way out the door with lunch in hand in less than 10 mins. How I went 6 years (4 of them right down the street from this location) and never stopped in is beyond me, but I'm glad I did.  Looking forward to trying the Chicken Philly next time around.  

Oh yeah....be careful...12\" is a medium...the large is a staggering 20\".  That is was justifies the higher than normal prices (bigger than normal sandwiches...step down a size from what you get elsewhere and it will cost the same, be as filling and taste better)."}
{"text":"24 hours and THE best subs in Las Vegas!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sandwich shop in Vegas! They were busy, but the service was reasonably fast. I didn't wait long for my sandwich, and it was made perfect (I'm picky with my order).  Very friendly customer service!  Ingredients were fresh and it tasted great!"}
{"text":"This place is more Miss than Hit. Unfortunately, because it was the closest to our house, the only other one was where our old jobs were at, and that was E Warm Springs, and that location was the first time I've have ever tried Capriotti's, and had a Bobbie my wife brought home from a work luncheon and was Sold ever since! So when this location was built, we were excited, so of course we tried it, but was very disappointed. We thought maybe because it was new, so we have tried it several times and as I said, it's Hit or Miss, more misses though. But now there is a newer location on S Rainbow, near Arroyo and I work in that area and frequent that location quite often and I have not had one bad food experience, it's been on point. So when we have a craving for Capriott's, we actually will drive from this side of town to the S Rainbow location, Because I just don't get this Ft Apache location, the Staff seem friendly and nice. Some may not be too tentative, but I really judge place by the food first, then  the staff and then the store. I noticed our last trip, which was a week ago, they had Remodeled, looks great in there, but let's work on the food please, and please be more tentative. Since we've been living in this SW area for 14 years now and having so-so experiences, I'm finally going to write my review and just give this place 2 stars."}
{"text":"Grubbing. This place make the best sandwices... Just don't ask any questions."}
{"text":"This was the first standalone Capriotti's shop I've been to. The shop was nice I guess, although most empty tables were dirty. There was a lot of angsty teens here, but you can just chalk that up to a day in the life at Downtown Summerlin. 

VEGGIE CHEESE STEAK ($7.19): I was so disappointed and a tinge annoyed to find that there is no veggie \"steak\" in this sandwich! How are you going to put the word 'steak' in a sandwich that has no steak?? Instead, there was blasted fake chicken inside the sub. And for all the meat eaters out there, there is indeed a vegetarian steak option (Morningstar Farms carries it and local food truck Garden Grill makes a REAL cheese steak sandwich). I felt duped and didn't care for the taste of the sandwich and would never ever, ever, ever order it again.  

Worth a Return Visit?
I like the location at Aliante better, but I if I was in the area I'd eat at this Capriotti's again. I'll stick to my usual tasty veggie turkey subs.

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #173"}
{"text":"Yelping proper etiquette be damned because I'm going to give Capriotti's 5 stars. Fuck it. It was Thanksgiving and I had the blues. The 49ers had just been destroyed by the Seahawks (note to self, don't watch football on Thanksgiving). My husband and I had absolutely no plans for the holiday and waited until after the game ended, which was around 8:00PM, to figure out what to do for dinner. Procrastinating will be the end of me. I settled on the Medley Buffet at Aliante because I thought they were going to have the butternut squash ravioli like they did last year. I was wrong. By this time, I was hungry and mad at the world. 

As a last resort option, I walked up to Capriotti's and ordered a Veggie Turkey sandwich with stuffing and the fixings. I had heard people rave about Capriotti's turkey sandwiches before, so I figured what the heck? Turkey=Thanksgiving. Once I tasted that sandwich, all my frustrations and woes dissipated. That sandwich was amazing! It was a Thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich. 

What can I say? Capriotti's saved my Thanksgiving. 

P.S. We got our sandwiches in like 4 minutes and took advantage of the Yelp check in offer of a free beverage. The cashier was super nice, too. We left with full bellies.

THE END."}
{"text":"They have the best sandwich I've ever had. It's thanksgiving on bread and it's called the Bobby. Everyone that I have taken here has fallen in love."}
{"text":"Size was pretty good as we ordered 20\" but it was too messy when we got it... didn't seem like much time was spent preparing it.  Burn it tasted really great and love having some good fast food options at the red rock casino."}
{"text":"I can see why this Capriottis has 2.5 stars. This is the worst Capriottis I have ever been to. I walked in with no one there and every single table was dirty. Every single chair was out of place and there was food all over the floors. Restaurant and back kitchen. Looked like the place hadn't been cleaned all day and there was three people working. 2 people were kind of doing stuff and the other girl was just standing there talking to the other girl. I wasn't greeted when I walked in like I have been every single time before at other Capriottis. It was the first time ever I have left a tip and was not thanked. I was totally turned off with this one. Never again will I come back to this Capriottis. What a surprise."}
{"text":"This review is going to be short and simple, Capriotti's is simply the best sandwich shop in Phoenix with the most awesome Philly cheesesteak sandwich I have had. They're hot and sweet peppers are amazing. Come try this place out!!"}
{"text":"Definitely tastes more homemade than that \"other\" chain. Got the 12 inch Capastrami for just over $10 which has Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and Coleslaw. I like how all the ingredients seemed somewhat melded together rather than being layered in a typical sub. The dressing and coleslaw, especially, just floated throughout the sandwich as if it were pretending to be a burrito. Tasty and filling sandwich from a place that's worth trying again. Just a couple of things to be aware of...First, parking directly in front of the place is somewhat limited cause rather than the lot being communal, each shop in the strip plaza seems to have a couple of assigned spots directly in front of it. Second, not sure if this were the place or other diners, but it smelled smoky."}
{"text":"The bobby is the best sandwich ever made! I love it. $20 for a 20 inch sandwich is a great deal, half for now half for later. Can never go wrong with a great pulled turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce, stuffing, and added lettuce. If you never been you must go!"}
{"text":"We went in to this restaurant at 7:40 pm. (closing time on door said 8) there were two young men behind the counter. Both looked at us when we walked in but didn't acknowledge us. One guy cleaning the grill was cursing telling the other guy a story. Neither one of them cared we were there. The other guy was putting bread away. We stood there for 5 mins without anyone helping us out even saying they would be with us in a min. Worst customer service. It smelled like rotting fish and the floors were so dirty. We decide to leave. We ended up going next door to Qdoba. Great customer service there."}
{"text":"The Pastrami is insane here...great to soak up the booze."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 sandwich's, one was fantastic. Other was made with wheat bread instead of the white bread we ordered."}
{"text":"Disappointed...read how 'great' this place was.  How can you offer meatball subs and not have meatballs, but be told \"we can put marinara on a sandwich if you want\"?

Visited for the 1st time today...very disappointed:
- 1st of all no meatballs
- dirty tables and no wait staff cleaning them; had to do it ourselves
- really small trash cans jammed to the brim - nasty!
- food, napkins on floor - gross
- no condiments available (you have to ask)
- one napkin holder on the main counter...come on...
- some high school kid taking orders/cooking with a wild 'fro and almost no hair netting...nasty II

The guy that owns this needs to go visit Fore Father's in Tempe to see a clean, well run operation.  Fore Father's cheesesteaks are delicious compared to this dump.

Off my list for good, I am not going back and cannot recommend this place to anyone..."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a delicious sandwich shop that's a step above the ordinary Subway and Quizmo's, then Capriotti's is the place to go. The first time I walked into this place, the staff behind the counter was super friendly. I told them I was a Capriotti's virgin and asked for some recommendations. The nice girl behind the counter suggested the \"Capastrami\" which is \"Hot Pastrami, Melted Swiss Cheese, Russian Dressing, and Cole Slaw on a soft roll.\" How can one go wrong with that? \"Sure thing\" I fired back and we were off to a journey towards flavorful bliss.

I watch in anticipation as the sandwich maker spins his magic. About 7 minutes later, my name is called out and this masterpiece wrapped in white butcher paper is bestowed upon me. To make a long story short... I ate it. It was damn good. The pastrami was tender and the cole slaw and russian dressing ratio was perfect. The bread was soft and the whole sandwich warm and inviting. I didnt think I was going to eat the whole thing.... But damn it was good. I didnt want to take the risk of bringing half of it home and not letting the sandwich fulfill its destiny.

On my 2nd trip back I ordered the Bobbie and it was a little dry. Somehow I thought the turkey would be warm. It's served cold. It was still good nevertheless.

On my 3rd trip back I ordered the meatball sandwich. It was yummy... But somehow my heart still belongs to the Capastrami.

I included some pictures. Dang. How do you people write food reviews without getting hungry?!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a trip to the Hoover Dam... had a delicious bobby and mushroom soup. The service was very friendly! I would recommend this place to my parents... my buddy got the three meat combo and is quoted as saying, \"best sandwich i've ever had in my life!\""}
{"text":"I have a thing where most places I find something I like and I don't stray from it. This is definitely one of those places. I don't know if I've had anything other than the philly cheese steak with hot and sweet peppers and I don't even care. This sandwich is amazing. The peppers really set it off but I'm sure it'd be pretty good even without them. I'm not judging this to be an authentic cheesesteak or anything as I'm pretty sure its not even close but I've never had one so I wouldn't know anyway.  I really don't come back to this place as much as I should since its kind of the opposite direction of anywhere I could possibly be headed. The reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because if it really deserved 5 stars I would be driving there all the time no matter where it was. Overall though, very good sandwich place and I have no complaints about the service or anything. The one thing that's odd is the sandwich sizes, I haven't been here in a while but I remember them being something like 8,12, and 20 inch? Apparently you shouldn't go here if you're on a diet but whatever I don't really worry about that. I'm also pretty sure I've downed whatever the large is in one sitting because it's so delicious but I suggest making two meals out of it if you want to be able to move afterwards. 

Anyway, solid 4 star, if you're craving a sub type sandwich definitely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Does anyone actually read reviews for a sandwich shop before they go?? Ok...lets pretend they do. This shop is new, clean and the employees do their jobs.

\" The Bobbie\" a Thanksgiving type sub, with Turkey, cranberry, stuffing etc. I personally didn't like the sub it was cold & mushy. Not a good consistency from the turkey & definitely not helped by the other ingredients like the stuffing. This sub had a texture of a tuna sub, not what I was expecting or wanting. I have had other thanksgiving type subs & the turkey was real craved turkey breast & whole cranberry, with light stuffing & hearty bread, this sub was not any of that. If I would try this chain every again I would see if they could do a steak sub any better? The large 20\" sub, drink & chips was approx $25.00 w/ tip."}
{"text":"I've eaten here so many times, but never wrote a review. I usually always get The Bobbi, and my mother gets the chicken cheesesteaks. We both always really enjoy our food. The staff is really friendly too. 
Also love that they're next to two Poke stops. ;p"}
{"text":"I'd heard about Capriotti's and wanted to try it, so I went to grab some sandwiches for myself and my family the other day. I was really impressed from the moment I walked in. The staff were all really friendly and helpful. I ordered two 12\" subs - the capistrami and a turkey sub. Both were great, but what really impressed me was that the turkey was roasted fresh in the store. I could see the kitchen from the counter area and there was a whole roasted turkey in a roasting pan waiting to be cut up for their sandwiches. You don't see that at many sub shops! All the toppings tasted really fresh and the bread was great, too. I'd definitely go back another time!"}
{"text":"On a Saturday afternoon, I had the 12\" bobbie for 8.18!

- The most popular sandwich is the bobbie. Recommended by employees. 
- Tasted like a Thanksgiving sandwich. Cranberry and turkey!
- Feeds two!
- It's like a viet sandwich, but italian style. both baguette! 
- Get your receipt. Do the Survery. Get $3 off your next sandwich!"}
{"text":"Terribly disappointed. My coworker went up there with our orders for sandwiches today. And at 12:20 in the afternoon they didn't have meatballs for meatball sub. That is the third time I have attempted to buy something at Capriotti's and they either didn't have it or they were missing one of the ingredients or it was just nasty sandwich. The Bobby would've been a great sandwich had they not put on so much stuffing and if the stuffing hadn't been all gooey. And then there's the fact that they don't have green peppers to go on sandwiches. But that was another visit. This one was the missing meatballs. I give them two stars because at least they were able to fulfill my coworkers sandwich order. And of course the Pepsi was OK."}
{"text":"They have many locations in Vegas and some in other states. I've never dined in and always get food to-go or delivered.  I've had the Capastrami, Bobbie, Cheesesteak, tuna, homemade roastbeef, Italian, meatball sub and veggie cheesesteak (just out of curiosity). I also get their grilled cheese sandwich which has at least 4 slices of cheese.  At the counter, they have Tastykakes - if you're from the East, you know the yummy goodness I'm talking about.

There are 2 things I used to dislike: tuna sub and salt & vinegar chips. But for some odd reason, when I tried eating these together, I was pleasantly surprised.  Their tuna isn't fishy, the mayo isn't overpowering and the onions are not overwhelming. Then you have salty tangy chips...mmmmmm...

But what really makes this place a must-try is their BOBBIE which is Thanksgiving in a sub sandwich.  It has stuffing, cranberry sauce and of course, turkey.  It sounds a bit strange when all eaten together but believe me, it is delish! So, if you like Thanksgiving, you will like the Bobbie."}
{"text":"This location has a lot of friendly staff and has a very modern look about it. I ordered a medium cheesesteak with ketchup, mustard, hot and sweet peppers, and mushrooms.  The hot peppers are not hot enough but everything tasted great!  I wish there had been more of them. I arrived a little after noon and there was no crowd but maybe 10'minutes later the line was out the door. 

It is not overly clear whether the customer is supposed to throw away their trash or if the staff clears it. A number of tables had food/trash left on them, but there was a trash can and bins for plates and bowls at the very back. It might benefit them to add another trash can or station towards the front of the store to avoid people leaving trash."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Not the cleanest environment. Good sandwiches. Fair prices. Recommended to anyone who enjoys sandwiches.

Among the few different Capriotti's locations I've eaten at, this location seems to make the best Capastrami and Cheesesteak. However, their Bobbie tastes gamey to me; tried their Bobbie 3-4 times and gave up. 

Ordering online has improved. My first experience ordering and paying online here, when I arrived 15 minutes later, the order had not been started yet. I've ordered online/paid online again since, and they've had my order ready upon arrival. 

Tip: Avoid the \"Wise\" Onion Rings. All crumbs. I think they're too brittle."}
{"text":"There is not a sandwich on the menu that I do not like! Favorite is the bobbie but everything is solid. Cheesesteak, Capastrami, Meatball are all excellent choices.

However late in the day, they might run out of bread"}
{"text":"Bobbie is a great sandwich,
Meatball hero is tremendous.
Cap a strami is the one that wins the awards!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering the philly cheese steak sandwich at this location since they've opened. Had one for dinner tonight and it was by far the best one I've ever had!  
The cashier was such a sweetheart and answered all my questions about the soups. 
Keep up the good work guys!  I don't know what new changes have been made; if it's new management or staff but I'm very pleased!"}
{"text":"Great food! I got the cheesesteak hoagie with mushroom and onions, I would recommend this to anyone in the Vegas area. Also pretty cheap. Quick service and nice retro diner atmosphere. Not crowded. Order a Small if you aren't looking for a giant sandwich to feed a family of nine though. I recommend."}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with caps.  Love all their subs, but this time ordered the cheesesteak with hot and sweet peppers.  Oh my!  It's filled with ooey gooey cheese and steak that's perfectly seasoned and cooked."}
{"text":"Quick friendly service and the yummy sandwich creations!  My fave is the Bobbie!  It's thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich!!  Cold turkey slices served with mayo, stuffing and cranberry sauce. Delicious!!! Although it may be even better if the turkey and stuffing were served hot.  The smallest is a 9\"!  It's a lot of sandwich!  You need to go hungry."}
{"text":"Great unique subs- sometimes on the weekend it can get a little backed up so place your order over the phone.  During football season i order either the cole turkey or bobby every sunday and take home to relax and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd switch Capriottis locations so I tried the newer one on boulder and lake mead. Wow how this place could careless for their customers. Rude ladies working the register. Place was very dirty and the counters were gross. Customer service was horrible so I turned around and walked out. I'll stick with the Horizon Dr. Location."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were good. The service was horrible. We placed an order at a location that wasn't this one... The wrong number was given on line. When we went to pick up order here... they made us go to the other restaurant to pick up the order at the other location. What kind of customer service is this??? We are on vacation... we had to get our car out of valet parking and drive to the other place. What was supposed to be a cheap and easy transaction turned into a total hassle."}
{"text":"I loved my sandwich. The Bobbie tastes like Thanksgiving! It's turkey, w/ stuffing, and cranberry on fresh bread. For reals! Extra yum! ...The two dudes that made our sandwiches were cool."}
{"text":"Came hungry, was not disappointed. Got the signature capastrami sandwich. Delicious with sweet Russian sauce and soft bread. Place was not busy, helpful staff and quick service."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place, the sandwich I ordered was served cold. It didn't taste good, I took the other half home, then microwaved it, it tasted 10x better. Why the heck do they serve their sandwiches cold? Another gripe I have is the soup, it cost $5.50 for a little cup, and seemed watered down, definitely won't be back for the soup. If I do go back it would be for the Bobbie to go, so I can hear it up at home"}
{"text":"I so love capriottis, but this locations horrid!! 

Slow is an understatement and they make no apologizes for it. If your going to be slow at LEAST get my order right. Noooooo not this location.. Too sad"}
{"text":"1.5 - 2 stars

Yelp reviews say this place messes up your order a lot - didn't happen to me, however, it took the workers 15 minutes to make 2 sandwiches.

BF also says the grill was also yucky because it had a lot of junk on it.

Won't be back to this location due to service - but will be back to Capriotti's."}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch and ordered a medium meatball sandwich. The medium is huge, I can only imagine what the large must look like. I only made it through half and wrapped up the rest for later. The bread is really good and they do not skimp on the cheese. The meatballs are pretty good as well. I would definitely hit this place up again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"You really gotta love Capriotti's sandwiches!  Between the Bobby and the cheesesteaks, this is one of my and my husband's favorite sandwich shops.  The service is ridiculously good and the people are so friendly.  I sometimes think it's a little bit expensive for what it is but whenever I'm craving a sandwich from here it always hits the spot.  I like the Green Valley location better because they have fries (their fries are SO delish.  Don't judge me...) but this is a great walkable lunch spot for us so it's high on my rotation!"}
{"text":"I called at 8:44pm it took them over a minute to pick up the phone and then told me they don't take call orders after 8:45.... it was now 8:47 I had been on the phone for over 2 minutes with them. Then the manager gets on and says yes it's 8:47 now so we can't do it. I said... I have been on the phone for well over 3 minutes now... what? And they said yup. Sorry. Drive in if you like. And the best part we are regular customers and we order VIA THE PHONE after 8:45 all the time. Will be going to new locations from now on. The extra drive will be worth not being treated like an idiot."}
{"text":"The combination of ingredients is fantastic I grew up on Thanksgiving Day leftover sandwich's, however the balance between bread and ingredients is way off it always feel like I have eaten bread and my pallet has been teased by the ingredients. I realize the money is in the meat, yet the meat makes the sandwich!"}
{"text":"Love the steak and cheese subs here. Like the northeast! Pastrami also awesome.

Will try the turkey with stuffing next- that looks great."}
{"text":"Visiting and we were down at the Worlds Largest Las Vegas Gift shop and saw a sign guy. So here we are very full (small hot italian sausage with peppers and onions; it is delicious btw). My friend had a generous BbQ Turkey salad; she recommends this. So thanks for the geat lunch."}
{"text":"Hmmm Let me see if i can find one bad thing to say about Capriotti's. Nope I cant. I always get the cheesesteak sub and it never lets me down. Every time im in town I hit up Cappys as we have yet to have one in Denver but they expanded to Davenport IA Go figure. And this time they had Brownies which i had one. It was oh so delicious. I agree Phone in or Fax ordering would be nice. And BEER"}
{"text":"If i could give Capriottis 10 stars i would. The sandwiches are always fresh. Something about the bread has me HOOKED like its a drug. A must is getting the brownie or lil choco cake. Who can resist sweets? I know i cant. Its close to the strip and the prices arent bad. Its a little busy but they try to get the food out quickly and their is plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch spot. The crew is great. Eric especially. He makes my sandwiches exactly as I ask every time. And that's really important to me. Great spot all around!"}
{"text":"The best cheesesteaks I've had to date.  Steak is lean, juicy and peppery. Roll is perfect - nice crust with soft center. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I were there a couple of months ago and we sorely regret going. The sandwiches were over priced, over cooked and didn't have much to them. If the prices were cut in half, the sandwiches would be decent enough to fill you up."}
{"text":"Visited this spot on my vacation. Wasn't sure if I wanted the cheese steak or a ham and cheese.  There is a location near my home and they ruined the cheese steak.  Took the gamble here and it paid off. It was bomb.

Really great service was quick and they were very courteous.  Got extra mustard and they gave the perfect amount.. plus they have wise chips which are bomb. Especially the cheese doodles. Doodles every time I say that word it feels weird lol."}
{"text":"Seriously, best sandwich I've had in a while. Definitely start with the Bobbie. Then work your way over to the other delicious things you can put in between pieces of bread. Oh, they do salads too."}
{"text":"I love capriottis & their sandwiches & its so nice when I can just order on the phone right before I go to lunch & walk on over & it is all ready.

The sandwiches/subs are always tasty & yummy!"}
{"text":"The only thing I ever order is the Bobbie. With a sandwich this good, there is no need to get anything else. The idea of Thanksgiving in a sandwich is brilliant and the person to come up with it should be given an award. Turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo is the normal combination. I prefer mine with light to little mayo, because the meat is not dry and the cranberry sauce makes sure that the sandwich is not like the Las Vegas landscape. 

This is a staple for when my friends and I decided to go kayaking down the Colorado River. One small sub was enough to power me through the five to six hour ordeal. Nothing goes along with a day down the river more than a Bobbie in my backpack and some beer dangling behind in the cold river."}
{"text":"This shop was as good as most Capriotti's around town. The service was fast. The food was good. I got The Bobbie, one of my favorites. The store was clean. I got my sandwich to go so I could eat like a slob in private:)"}
{"text":"If you don't know Capriotti's, you're missing out!
Convenient location. Friendly staff, clean facility.
I pretty much always get the Bobbie, extra mayo! Yum!"}
{"text":"If I was basing this review on my last sandwich, I would give them 2 stars. But I usually love Capriottis so I gave them a pass.
I usually get turkey or italian or ham and cheese. Well I got a Cheesesteak, I've heard all of this raving, and haven't had one from Caprriottis in years. Yuck!, thats not a cheesesteak! It has big chunks of meat, like they chopped up the meatballs or a cheeseburger. No sir I don't like it. It wasn't even good if they would've named it something else. I'll stick to what I like, no more Caps Cheesesteaks for me. I'll go to Caps for their Yummy Turkey. And go to Pops or Geri's for my cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"So I was out voted by my family on what to have for Thanksgiving dinner...I wanted turkey, the rest wanted steak. Well steak won and I had been jonesing for turkey ever since. 
I went to Capriotti's for a Bobbie to fulfill my turkey craving. And boy did it work. YUM! It made me happy:) Staff was pleasant, even though they were busy and seemed understaffed. We got our order quickly and it was perfect."}
{"text":"I rarely give 4 stars on yelp.  This place deserves it.  There is no doubt that they are using high quality ingredients.  

My wife, her sister, and I were all completely satisfied with each of our sandwiches.  We will be back."}
{"text":"I ate \"The Bobbie\" which the girl said was their most popular. Well I guess I'm not a conformist excuse it was a fairly bland sandwich that basically just takes like canned shredded turkey and chewy bread.

Not a fan."}
{"text":"I placed an order over the phone and asked them to read it back to me since it was a difficult order! Went in and picked up my order and asked if the sandwiches were labeled. They said yes and I paid and left! Mind you I had my 3 month old with me so I was in and out fast! I drove twenty mins to my husband office to find out that they had messed up the order! I called and the mgr was rude. Telling me if I wanted a new sandwich I would have to bring the messed up one back! I did mention that I was 20 mins away and it is lunch time! He told me how was he suppose to believe me!! I told him I would take a photo and text it to him! This location has horrible service! Not accommodating at all! The mgr should pick a new career"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious sandwiches. I still have pleasant memories of my Capastrami...loaded with pastrami,swiss cheese,russian dressing and cole slaw. yummy! My son really enjoyed his Italian and my wife loved her turkey on whole wheat. The ingredients really taste fresh and the bread was excellent. The ladies working here were friendly enough and seemed very efficient. Very solid sandwich shop."}
{"text":"The best lunch in the southwest part of the valley.  Staff is friendly, food is very good and the place is always clean!  Best lunch under $12.00.  Is very true!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's always makes a great sanwich! The Bobbie tastes like Thanksgiving leftovers in the best way possible. I also love their broccoli & Cheese soup.  Bread always tastes fresh.

I always get the small but still can only eat half. This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Editors note:  you will more than likely learn nothing from the following review:

I've been a fan of Capriottis ever since college when I'd often walk over to their location on Maryland right next to UNLV for lunch.  Immediately I was smitten with all of the specialty subs like the Slaw Be Jo (Roast Beef with Cole Slaw), the Bobbie (Thanksgiving on a sub), and the Capastrami (Pastrami and Cole Slaw).  Eventually I branched out to become a fan of their cheesesteaks, the grilled italian, and their normal roasted turkey sandwich (I personally enjoy their turkey subs more than any other chain).

Lately this is my location of choice as it's conveniently on the way to a friend's house that I spend a lot of time watching football or playing videogames or doing things I should have stopped doing when I was 21 or younger.  

So for a while I mixed things up every time I went.  One week I'd get the Capastrami (almost always excellent), the next I might get the Bobbie (kinda burnt myself out on these a few years back, but every once in a while I go back), etc.  Lately my vice is the cheesesteak with hot peppers.  My dad is from Philly and I've been back to Philly and had genuine Philly cheesesteaks with his family there, and I gotta say this is not nearly as good as some of the ones I had there, naturally.  I do think that it holds its own, but I'm not one of those who is obsessed with finding a perfect version of regional favorites.  Sure I'd love a more authentic tasting cheesesteak, but I'm not going to knock a place like Capriottis who can get me to what I consider close enough for $8.  

So yeah, the quality at this location is pretty standard to other locations I've had.  I've never really had a bad sandwich from here.  The roast beef at most locations, including this one has seemed a little dry/tough to me.  It still tastes really good, but I prefer a softer/moister version.  Service is always fine and take-out orders are usually ready quickly which is a bonus.

One knock against several locations, and not just this one, is I've noticed there seems to be a lack of desire to deliver.  I can't really blame them because I usually am the lazy jackass on the other end of the line who doesn't want to leave the house to pick them up, so it's like a tug of war of laziness that results.   The only difference is several of these locations actually advertise delivery and then seem to always have an excuse or not want to do it unless it's an extremely large order.  To be fair, I haven't tried to arrange delivery from this one in a while, so maybe they've changed, I usually just go with takeout now.  Yeah, they won the lazy tug of war.  :("}
{"text":"These people know how to make a sandwich! Better than the larger chains. Plus they have really awesome vegetarian options such as vegetarian cheesesteaks. The staff is very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Is this how the \"greatest sandwich in America\" is served? Sad day to be an American! The girl at the counter was nice. I ordered my sandwich at 6:25pm, the lady from the back making the sandwiches yells \"take out only\" clearly not thrilled with having to be at work or clean more tables...well, I was going to get it to go anyway but if you close at 7, what's the problem?! I ate half of my \"bobbie\" sandwich, it was okay after scraping off half of the cranberry sauce and trying to hold the top half of my broken bread together. I lost my appetite after looking at the other half, so that was that. Disappointing overall, high claims that they did not live up to. Don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Oh Capriotti's you've been disappointing me lately. I have always been a fan since I tasted my first sandwich several years ago when I moved to Las Vegas. However for the past several months this location specifically has been getting skimpier and skimpier on their meat. 

I'm a simple turkey sandwich on wheat girl and when I first started ordering these a few years ago there was so much turkey on them it continually fell off. That's not a problem for me! However the last few months I have noticed there is less and less meat and the topper today was when I got my sandwich and about 30% of my bread wasn't even covered. 

I hope you get it together since your right in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Capriottis since my first encounter with the 'Bobbie' at a catered work function. I have since grown to love the 'Capastrami.' It is an amazing sandwhich creation made with pastrami and cole slaw. The 'Bobbie' has turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo. I haven't had a bad sandwhich from this place, or any other Capriotti's in town. THe cheesesteaks are above par as well. The only issues I have with this chain are the lack of drink varieties and the price. I'm not saying it's not worth the price because inch for inch you're paying for quality meats and condiments. I just think that I would probably eat there more often if it didn't cost me $45 to feed my family of four."}
{"text":"Very good bread and I always get the supreme cheese steak,,, not sure what it is, but this place is special,, awesome flavors, fresh soft bread,.... Little pricy, and a Large, is LARGE almost good for 3 ppl..."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is Capriotti's. The location is INSIDE the courthouse. So if you get summoned for jury duty, this is the closest thing to food you have aside from the vending machines on every floor. 

Service could be better but I understand the stress with the line of potential jurors going out the door. 

I got my usual Cheese steak with onions, mushrooms, and hot peppers. Yum! 

Again, Capriotti's is Capriotti's so there's not disappointment there!"}
{"text":"I was just about to place my order,  when I looked over the counter and saw how filthy it was.  The grill was black and food debris all over the counters. I immediately left and went to the Cappriotti's on Sunset and Annie Oakley. They are extremely clean. Thank God!"}
{"text":"This place is soooo gooood!  So, me & a couple of my buds are strolling around the outlets in Vegas around noon and we get hungry.  What to eat?  We want to get something not too filling cause we're gonna get our grub on at a prime rib joint later on that evening (see prime rib restaurant review).  My friend Albee thinks of the perfect place (he knows about good food).  Capriotti's Sandwich Shop!  We all order the cheesesteak and it's tasty!  The rest of the menu looks good too; I can't wait until I get to go back and try the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ohhh, I hate to be the anomaly but here we go:

I was really looking forward to this sandwich. I ordered the Bobbie because it sounded interesting and it's not like I can get this type of sandwich at Subway, right? Be warned (or elated), the sandwiches are HUGE. 

The Bobbie is a 'Thanksgiving Anytime' type of sandwich. It's pulled turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayo. I don't know if it was just an off day or what, but my turkey was so DRY. I also didn't really care for the flavor of the sandwich. The bread was good though. My bf ordered the meatball sub which he said was just average. 

This place got crazy packed at lunch while we were there. All locals too. Always a good sign. 

A memorable side note- two high school kids sat next to us with their large Capastrami (to split). I was floored at the size of the sandwich and asked them if that was the large (20\"). They said that they always get a large to split because it's cheaper and they get more food. They told me to order it next time: a Capastrami with chicken cheesesteak instead of pastrami. It looked fantastic. 

I haven't given up on this place. I plan on trying those kids' custom Capastrami next time."}
{"text":"The food is about average everytime I order. This is something I would not go out of my way for. The absolute WORST is when I order delivery for one sandwhich it take up to 2 hours! That is rediculous. The delivery driver is never apologetic either. Last time I will be ordering from them until they get better delivery drivers."}
{"text":"What an odd feeling to see Capriotti's in the bright sunshine of Scottsdale 25 years after getting take out from Capriotti's back in grungy old Delaware. The juxtaposition was at first a bit off-putting, but I drove right in and enjoyed a Capastrami sandwich just like it was yesterday. Only this time I got to walk out into the sunshine of Arizona vs. out into another rainy or cloudy day back east. It's a lot pricier than the old days, but still pretty darn good."}
{"text":"One of the most amazing customer service experience in a very long time!

The cook was extremely helpful and attentive to our order. 

We were not the easiest order and yet she genuinely made us feel at ease! I will return and recommend to everyone.

Thank you Martha for your personal interest and the rest of the crew for your patience. 

You are an amazing team!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped here on our way out of Vegas. Staff was very friendly and informative, and encouraged us to buy the combos for an instant win contest... which we both got! Apart from the awesome sandwiches, we won a free catering tray and a cookie. We let the staff know we're from out of state and wasn't sure about coming back for the tray... but they were glad to make the tray for us for the road! We're very happy we stopped here, the sandwiches and staff are both wonderful!"}
{"text":"After my initial review, I was contacted by Capriotti's apologizing for the messed up service.  I appreciate Capriotti's reaching out and trying to make things better.  I received in the mail today a letter from the assistant manager, Cody Robinson.  In the letter, he apologized again.  I'm very thankful for his continued communication and professionalism with me.  I am happy to report that my husband and I ordered at Capriotti's last Saturday, June 16th and our order was perfect!  Thank you! ;o)"}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in America? Hardly. How about 1 step ahead of subway. The Bobbie is nice. Caps cheesesteak is a greasy mess... I mean I don't mind a little grease on my cheesesteak, but not full saturation."}
{"text":"Understand that this review is based off other sandwich places. 

When it comes to getting a sandwich, it seems like you have a million options and each one can offer you something similar but different. At Capriotti's, you get something that is completely unique!

Their sandwich's taste like a home cooked meal with a piece of bread on each side. They are very hearty sandwiches and WILL fill you up, so be ready to leave in a food coma.  

Great place to stop for a filling sandwich."}
{"text":"I was never a huge fan of pastrami, but my friend heard good things about the Capastrami at Capriotti's so we gave it a try. The cole slaw paired with hot pastrami is definitely what makes it different- in a good way, of course. I love this sandwich, and I've had it each time I've gone back to Vegas since I first had it. I've also tried the Bobbie, which is also tasty, but gets boring after a few bites."}
{"text":"Got big philly delivered for lunch. Quality was perfect as usual. Manager personally brought my sandwich about 10 or 15mins after the call. I'm an utterly satisfied customer. Keep it up and I'll eAt phillys so much I'll clog a blood vessel. Thank you horizon capriot!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing to get from Caprioties is the Bobbie. It's just like thanks giving in a sandwich and i love the small because it's still big enough for me to have some for later"}
{"text":"The Capistrami is incredible. The employees are always welcoming and make me excited to eat here. Chase and Ariel were delightful. Will always come back to this location."}
{"text":"When you get something as simple as a cheese steak wrong, you don't have the right to display a sign boasting \"Best Sandwich in America.\" Not only was it missing ingredients clearly listed on the menu, but it was desert dry. Barely any cheese, petrified chopped steak and disappointing bread.

There were two high school age girls running the shop with no manager on duty. They didn't seem to have a clue. I asked for my sandwich to be fixed, it came back more of the same. I requested my money back, giving back practically a full sandwich and had to wait 10 minutes while the girl called her manager to learn how to void an order.

Lousy customer service, terrible food. Based on first impression, I'd be skeptical to try other items on their menu. Do yourself a favor and find a better sandwich joint."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best cheesesteak in the west! Bread is delicious and fresh! I'm from Boston so I know a good cheesesteak! I like mine with hot peppers and extra mayo. Friendly staff and speedy service. I'm never disappointed! You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches! Can't wait till I get the chance to go again!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options! Really appreciate them offering veg options. Good bread. Large size portions."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving kind of sandwhich.... Are you kidding me... I'm coming here every day for the rest of my days"}
{"text":"i've been here a few times. I have thoughts on all the visit good and bad...the sandwiches are good. they could be better. as times gone by they have shrunk is portion size of meat filling etc.
the employees are very young and not to professional. but the price is right for the quanity.
my three favorites are the capastrami, the bobbi,and the italian sub. Good Luck, hope you enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"So today I gave capriottis on Sahara another chance. The past two times they messed up my order so badly I couldn't eat my sandwich. Today same thing I'm so done with them period"}
{"text":"So I'm not sure why locals love this place. The meat subs were fancy looking so maybe that's why? I  had the veggie sub and well, it was just 2 slices of cheese with minimal lettuce and a slice of tomato."}
{"text":"We went to the old town Scottsdale location. We saw the sign that said the best sandwiches in the world. We bought two small roast beef sandwiches. We took them on the plane home to California. When we opened them, in the plane,a spattering of lettuce was on the outside of the bread, two very thin slices of tomato, again on the outside of the bread. There was supposed to be Mayo on them, but that is hard to believe given the tiny amount, maybe half a teaspoon. The roast beef was dry, stringy, overcooked and tough. It was the world's worst sandwich."}
{"text":"3-stars only because the food is always consistant and tasty. 

This is one of the newer locations of the chain inside the Summerlin mall. The inside was nice and clean with an industrial feel to it. The signage from which your order from is not the greatest choice they should have stuck with their old style. Soda machine had numerous \"out of order\" post-its attached to it, hmm is it that hard to fix?"}
{"text":"I come here when I have cravings for specific sandwiches. The Cap's specials are mainly what I come here for, especially the Capastrami. The Russian dressing and slaw are a good counter to the salty, hot pastrami. I'll occasionally get the Bobbie or the Slaw Be Joe. The sandwich sizes are large, but perfect for people with big appetites like myself.

They also offer party trays which I've had to get from here multiple times for work meetings. The small trays easily feed 8-9 for ~$60. Anymore than that, a large tray would probably be better. They provide plates, napkins, utensils, and condiments upon request. The manager is always helpful when he takes these orders, just give them ample notice of your order.

I haven't had problems with their service and they've been prompt. When I'm feeling like a Capastrami, I'll be there."}
{"text":"Called in an order for 4 sandwiches and only had to wait 2 or 3 minutes after we arrived for them. Good service, good sammies and happy eaters."}
{"text":"We're big fans of Capriottis and have always had excellent service at this location. Our personal faves are the Bobbie and the SlawBeJo. If you haven't been in to give them a try I highly suggest you do. Also, phone ahead and save yourself a little bit on the wait time."}
{"text":"Banged out my order with a quickness! Good sammies and we'll be back. However, the guy at the cash register was a bit of a rooster."}
{"text":"I usually am satisfied and the food is great. I am disappointed with my last visit there at the Lake Mead and Boulder Hwy location though. The lady used the same gloves she used to touch money with to make my sandwich. Also I ordered The Bobbie and pretty much didn't have any turkey at all on it."}
{"text":"Is it possible to be in love with a sandwhich? I think so. I can't say one bad thing about Capriotti's. I used to be strictly a Subway girl (I know right!!) Before my fiancé convinced me to try Capriotti's,  abd I'm so glad he did!

Everything tastes super fresh, and delicious! My favorite has to be tge steak abd cheese with the hot peppers, mushroom, and a little bit of mayo (it makes the hot peppers not so hot) I've also had thd Italian which was my go to sub before the steak and cheese. Salami ham provolone cheese on a fresh soft slice of bread you can't go wrong! 

You also have to try their signature sandwhich the \"bobby.\" As I like to call itbits Thanksgiving in one sandwhich!  Roast turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce! Absolute heaven! I know this review if for this Capriotti's on South Rainbow, but I have never had a bad experience at any of the Capriotti's that I have been to! If you are visiting,  a local forever,  or a newcomer to the valley you must try Capriotti's!  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwich.  We had the Bobby on our first visit.  Thanksgiving on a bun!  Delicious.  Nice people too.  Good value."}
{"text":"Do not try to order for delivery.  Very unprofessional children working at this location.  We asked if they had a driver today because they sometimes don't despite the fact that they say \"WE DELIVER\" painted on the front window.  They said yes, it would be delivered within 45 minutes.  An hour went by, and we called to hear \"We haven't made your sandwiches yet.  I don't know where the driver is.\"  Thanks for the call!  Nice to know you appreciate your customers.  Well, your driver just cost you a customer.  NO MORE \"BEER MONEY\" for you!  Done.  BTW, the cheese steak is ok, but not an authentic Philly cheese steak."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak or the Bobby. You can not go wrong. I have been eating at this deli for probably 12 years! A philly cheese steak is the best hang over cure!"}
{"text":"Grabbed this on our way out of town and it was the same quality as their other locations. Good bang for the buck. It was around lunch time so it took awhile to get the food, about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Somehow I always seem to end up at this place on my way through Vegas, pretty exceptional sandwiches.  Everything we tried there so far was solid.  Don't go there planning to eat light though."}
{"text":"Pretty good, I'm still not sure what all the hype is about. I don't go out of my way to go eat here, there's limited seating and they overcharge for their bottled drinks like snapple/pure leaf tea etc.I paid $2.99 for a pure leaf tea and saw it at Vons that same day for $1.00.

They only have white bread no wheat or healthier selections...."}
{"text":"I am a Capriotti's convert, though I will say that my usual location is actually the one on Paradise and Harmon, across from the Hard Rock (logistically, that one's closer). I have been to the one over here on Sahara though and it is equally as delightful, despite not being in quite as nice of a center.

The folks at Capriotti's are always super friendly and helpful -- and prompt, which is a big deal for lunch orders. My usual is a cheesesteak with sweet  peppers, though I sometimes get the hot peppers. Warning: hot peppers are really, really hot. If you get a mix of sweet and hot, it's hot but balanced-- just the hot peppers might burn your tongue off. Though, in fairness, I've got a wicked case of white girl mouth, so that's neither here nor there."}

{"text":"Best sandwiches in town. The Bobbie and Capistrami are fantastic. Extremely helpful and friendly customer service."}
{"text":"I've been to a bunch of different Capriotti's Sandwich Shop locations, and this one is just okay. The service was slow and the veggie cheesesteak, which I love, was just okay. I think the bread was a bit on the old side. Also, there are no restrooms, and I really hate that!  I don't want to walk to another restaurant to use their facilities.  I don't understand how zoning laws in Las Vegas allow a restaurant to function without a rest room."}
{"text":"Amazingly delicious veggie cheesesteak sandwich.  Shared a $12.75 20\" sandwich and we were both full.  Comes with cheese, peppers, and onions, if you want mushrooms, there is an extra charge.

I deducted one star because they need a better restroom situation."}
{"text":"I went here with my heart set on a veggie cheesesteak and you were out.  I was told by the sandwich jockey that it is \"a very popular sandwich.\"  Well, if you are aware of this, then why not order/stock more?  It is either in refrigerated or frozen vacuum-sealed packs (yes, I have seen you prepare it before), so that tells me that it has a decent shelf life... so keep it in stock!

My second choice was an eggplant parm sandwich, until you told me the marinara sauce has meatballs in it... what?  Please consider the vegetarians and don't have the meat in the red sauce.  It is extremely easy to keep meatballs separate from marinara sauce, and just sauce the meatballs as needed.

I am so disappointed in Capriotti's Red Rock!!!!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a sandwich connoisseur.  So much so, it's to the point that the missus shakes her head at how much I love the things.  But it's the sheer amount of variety that makes them appealing.

So after reading the reviews, I had to go and check this place out.

I decided to be different and try the regular turkey sub, and it was really good.  Not the usual deli slabs of meat, but chunks, and it was moist and flavorful.  Perhaps a little too much lettuce, but I could adjust that, so who cares, really.  The missus got the meatball sub, and that was no slouch.

As I ate, I read through the reviews on here, and each one was a variant of the same message:

\"Try the Bobbie!\"
\"Try the Capistrami!\"
\"Bobbie!\"
\"Capristrami!\"
\"Bobbie!\"
\"Capristrami!\"
\"Bobbie!\"
\"Capristrami!\"

\"Alright, dammit, I'll try one of the sandwiches\", I nearly cried out, but I figured that would only get me more unusual looks than I normally get, so I went up to the counter and ordered the Bobbie for dinner later tonight.

Holy crap, I am a convert now.  It was like magical wood nymphs placed happiness upon my tongue.

So let me join my voice to the chorus extolling the virtues of the Bobbie, and now I feel compelled to see what the Capristrami is all about.

These are FINE sandwiches.  Well worth the trip off-Strip to sample one of these.  And prices are pretty fair, all things considered.

I think I have a new haunt to get my sammich on."}
{"text":"The Bobbie was a good call. Good ol thanksgiving leftover sandwich. Pretty nice portions too"}
{"text":"Food is solid as I hope it always will be. 
Review in regards to the customer service. A few times my order was incorrect. This particular occasion, it started out okay. I had ordered 4 sandwiches online to avoid the wait, but it looked like the staff was slammed. I had to wait an additional 10/15 minutes. I got my sandwiches, and decided to check them. Two of my sandwiches did not have a marking on them. I requested the slaw and sauce of the capastrami to be on the side, and neither one were in the bag. 
I mentioned it to the cashier, and she was unsure so she asked the others which was which. One gentleman took 3 of the sandwiches, and reopened all of them. From what I could see my order was made incorrectly. He fixed it with a not so happy demeanor thus a star deducted. Oh well, I am just glad he fixed it."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is a chain, but don't let that stop you if you want one of the best Italian subs in town, as well as cheesesteaks that rival what you'd find in my hometown Philadelphia.  AND they sell Tastykakes!

I live in the neighborhood and often pop into this location (in Red Rock Resort's food court) to pick up a sandwich for lunch (tip: park in the parking structure or parking lot closest to the highway so you don't have to walk clear across the casino floor to get to the food court).

Unfortunately, Capriotti's doesn't serve french fries, so they are unable to complete the Holy Trinity of Unhealthy Philadelphia Fast Food which I love so much - 1) cheesesteaks, 2) cheese fries, and then 3) Tastykakes for dessert.  But I can't knock them for what they do serve at all, so thumbs up."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches...and the girls are awesome! Thank u ladies for the suggestions! Tried both the Bobbie and Capastrami... Out of this world..."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming eating here. Both times the subs where really good.  The guys are always very friendly."}
{"text":"Awesome roll!
Roast beef with mayo, tomato and sweet peppers..... Awesome!
Great value as well!
Meats are homemade not processed!  It makes all the difference!"}
{"text":"I love Cap's; when I ate meat my favorite sub was the Slaw and Roast Beef, and the Bobbie is great of course :) But not only do they offer great meat subs, they have Vegetarian ones too! 
They use a soy based sub for their veggie subs, and it tastes really good. I got the veggie version of the roast beef and slaw sub, and my dad got the Bobby.
I was disappointed to see that they skimped on the soy turkey, so it was essentially all slaw. The Bobby was perfect though, so it just seems like they skimp out on the veggie subs at this location. 
They also have a soda fountain that is accessable by patrons, so that's nice- you don't have to ask them for a refill, just get your own."}
{"text":"I was super exited to try one of the best sandwiches in America. I got the Capastrami. I ordered the Russian dressing on the side, but as usual with fast food This didn't happen. But they did put the Coleslaw on the side. 
Screwups happen. As for the sandwich, the pastrami was well seasoned. If you are looking for a true deli sandwich, one piled high with meat, this isn't the place. It's similar to Subway in size. Maybe it's just me but I prefer Deli sandwiches like Jason's Deli...."}
{"text":"so check it out. im flying from Baltimore to Vegas and i was sitting with some rodies from the Rick Springfield band and he said that anytime Rick plays in the Vegas area he has to stop at the local Capriotti's for a sandwich. Great move to come here. Try the Capastrimi."}
{"text":"This is based on the two times I TRIED to get sandwiches from them in the same week! First time was around 5pm and they had a sign that they ran out of bread and were closed. The second time was about 7:30pm and the doors were already locked when the close at 8pm! I really like Capriotti's but I will not come back to this location even though it's around the corner from my home."}
{"text":"If I could give the customer service 10 Stars I would give the customer service 10 stars but I ordered the Bobby and everybody talks about how great it is but I didn't care for that much but that's just me personally but I feel like everybody should experience and try it if they are a fan of the holidays. It's thanksgiving and Christmas on a bun!"}
{"text":"My family and I were staying at the Hard Rock Cafe and walking to the NBA summer league games. Found the shop on yelp and it was amazing. 2-20 inch subs fed five of us no problem they even cut it into six pieces for us. Both subs wake up I would've given five stars easy. The steak sandwich is a little hot if you get everything on it."}
{"text":"Just had a hot sausage sandwich with peppers, provolone and marinara and it was delicious. Great take-out place with wide range of cold and hot sandwiches. I prefer ordering from the hot list."}
{"text":"Great selection on the menu which can be friendly for any diner. 
A little overpriced for the quality. But ok for the item itself (portions)

The bread tasted a bit old and stale. I asked for extra sauce on my sandwich and it was overlooked. Maybe it was just a busy day but it lacked customer service and attention to detail."}
{"text":"This place used to be the bee's knees years ago. Came here about 2 months ago the food was horrendous. The pastrami was overcooked and the turkey taste like cat food. Tried to get our money back left the sandwiches there they refused a refund. Had to call bank to get money back that way. Have a few contacts who still live in this area and they said the service at this location is beyond horrible. Just came by this afternoon to give them one more chance and they are closed. Not closed based on hours but this location is permanently closed. There is signage in the window. Probably for the best."}
{"text":"My family and I love Capriotti's. We visit the specific location at least twice a month. Tim is always very upbeat and friendly. However every time I visit there seems to be some sort of discrepancy, whether it be my order accuracy or a change of price... If it wasn't for the delicious menu, we probably really wouldn't keep coming here or putting up with those little things. They definitely need to work on double checking orders. Especially with how busy this location is doing online orders over the phone orders or coming in in person."}
{"text":"I definitely like Capriotti's, but there's something lacking in the flavor department. Salt. To me, the bread tastes very bland, as does the turkey and stuffing on the Bobbie sub. When you have a bunch of cranberry sauce on a sandwich, you need to balance the sweetness with something. I still like it because it's very unique, but I wish they could incorporate some sodium in the cooking/baking processes. I'd probably be a regular if this was corrected. Sprinkling salt on after the fact just isn't the same.

Besides the Bobbie, I also tried the Slaw-Be-Jo which was very good (despite the bland bread). It is also a sweet sub with the Russian dressing, so it could use some balance as well."}
{"text":"My first time at this location and it was ok. It was very quiet as there was only one other customer. I got the medium Veggie Turkey and it was just way too salty, I only ate half and threw out the other half. Such a waste. I should also mention that when the young man was making my sandwich, he asked if I wanted oil in it, I said no. Well guess what was in the sandwich... oil."}
{"text":"I was the only customer in the shop.  Ordered a Bobbie to eat there.  I didn't mind that the one guy behind the counter wanted to be chatty while I ate but was it really necessary to tell me about your acid reflux and the fact that you throw up when you wake up too early?  Seriously train your employees please."}
{"text":"Got a Cole Turkey and the Bobbie, because they roast their own turkeys in house, and The turkey meat itself was pretty good - the problem is that they drenched the turkey in so much mayo and Russian dressing and then the coleslaw had a lot of mayo in it, I had to pull out just the meat and actually dry the meat off

The amount of fat in the mayo, russian dressing, and coleslaw was insane I could feel my heart slowing looking at it,. after a couple paper towels of wipe down - there was very little actual meat on the sandwich (a medium) and it was mainly bread and sauce 

The bread was nothing special - this turned out to be highly disappointing, they certainly are not the best sandwich shop on the block much less the country

The Bobbie was also drenched in mayo but less so, and that one had more meat was better put together and the Mrs liked it

The cookies were just ok to me however the Mrs enjoyed the sugar one quite a bit 

Unlikely we will be back, if we ever do we will certainly ask for all sauces on the side

It is a shame because they have good quality turkey meat pulled from a real turkey and hide it with bad bread and sauces, sometimes less is more"}
{"text":"Great place and the sandwiches were perfectly crafted with lots of tasty meat and seasoned well.
The staff was very friendly.
Wish we had one in our state!"}
{"text":"Are you in a need of a good sandwich? Go to Capriotti's and you will be taken care of. This particular location is on the small side. The service is good and that is what counts. They also have seating outside for the days when it's nice weather.

I just recently tried Capriotti's and boy I was missing out. They have their signature sandwiches like \"The Bobbie\" which is thanksgiving sandwich. The other day I opted to try the hot Italian sausage sandwich. The sausage was so good and had the right amount of spice. I loved the cheese oozing out of the bread as I bit into it.

Capriotti's gets 3 stars for good service and good food!"}
{"text":"Overhyped. Capriotti's has some good sandwiches and some that just don't connect.

My favorite sandwich here is the Capastrami, greasy pastrami grilled with melted Swiss, generously topped with creamy cole slaw and Russian dressing. Reubenesque and held together well by the bread.

Unfortunately, that same bread is the reason why Capriotti's cheesesteaks and Italian subs don't work. The rolls on which its subs are served are hard and dense, which means they don't absorb the favors and moisture of the rest of the sandwich.

The cheesesteaks also suffer from meat that's grisly, dry and flavorless. Bland would be a word for it.

The Bobbie isn't my thing - I think mayo is gross, and without it the Bobbie sandwich gets unbearably dry. That being said, the store roasted turkey goes great on cold subs with provolone and hot peppers.

Jersey Mike's is better for cold subs and Pop's is the place to go in Vegas for cheesesteaks."}
{"text":"I personally like the food at Capriottis, I prefer the one on Silverado Ranch for a few reasons.

1. It is much cleaner
2. The staff is much friendlier 
3. The food is prepared better 
4. They have yet to mess up an order

The location on Sahara is not very clean and everytime we have called in an order the girl that \"ALWAYS\" seems to answer the phone is completely rude and for some reason does not understand what no peppers means. The sandwiches are always a few notches below the other locations and the attitude of the employee may actually play into that response. 
I hope they can turn around the customer service and clean up the act a little because overall capriottis has a good product."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING..... Not only do you get a Huge Sandwich, but you get punched in the face with flavor. I have tried a few of the sandwiches that they list and they have all been delicious, The hot pastrami comes with pastrami, \" Alot of it I may add\" and Cole slaw. I do not like slaw but it was great in the sandwich.  This is no run of the mill sandwich farm, you get more than just a few deli slices and a half a head of lettuce. 

Dont make the mistake of thinking you are at your ordinary sandwich shop and ordering a large.. It is 20 inches long and probably 6 inches around if not more.  This is worth the trip if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I was getting ready to install a new stereo in our car and wanted to grab something quick for dinner that was still delicious and easy to eat so what better than snatching up some Capriottis right? Well, I was very very let down this time. We called into the store to make the order and everything seemed great at that point since they took down the order and read it back perfectly. Soon after that the things to come should have been a fair warning.

Upon walking into this location all of the tables were occupied by very gloomy looking folks almost pissed off looking and not a single one of them had a sandwich on the table. There was a gentlemen in line before me picking up a to go order and as I stood there waiting I watched as the guy cooking everything was literally running full sprints around the back trying to get sandwiches made, and the upset patrons seemed to get even more in the dumps by seeing someone get in line. 

Before I tell you what went down with my grub let me give you our order, 1 med capastrami with extra Russian dressing, 1 med capastrami with hot peppers and mushrooms, 1 med Bobbi. All seems simple right, considering it is basically a order of all things Capriottis the basic we are known for this type sandwiches. My order was ready pretty quick so we grabbed them and went on to the house to get our grub on and upon unwrapping what should have been a delicious monstrosity of a sandwich in turn was a dry overcooked lump of letdown... The bread was so crazy dry it was like eating dry oats and to top that off the pastrami was cooked so long it was truly like chewing leaves... Not that I have chewed on leaves before. The final straw for me was that I order Capriottis at work quite a bit and when you order it with hot peppers and mushrooms they are cooked into the meat just the way I like it and for some reason the cook put my sandwich together and then threw raw hot pepper on top of the slaw and then raw mushrooms... ummmm, that is not how its done.

In my opinion a sandwich is one of those things that you look forward to eating for some reason, that is great when your sandwich is awesome but when you get a bad sandwich it is almost as bad as if someone kicked your dog or something. I wish this review was to say how amazing the sandwiches were and that I am sporting a new Capriottis shirt and hat because that sandwich was so good I want to be a poster boy, unfortunately that is not the case. I don't know that I will return to this location."}
{"text":"Still a \"no.\" Actually a **ll no!

So I swore after the first time, never again.

Well, they sent a coupon for a free 9\" turkey sub and I was hungry. Everyone deserves a second shot, right?

5 stars to the employees. Friendly and very helpful. But...

Staff was not fully prepared for the coupon offer. Manager was not prepared, either.

5 stars for the bag of Doritos. 5 stars for the Mountain Dew.

The sandwich: bread was bone dry. The turkey was more like pressed turkey dust with no discernible pieces of actual meat. It was dry. Lettuce is iceburg and it was wilting and brown on the edges. Bland. I saw the seasoning stuck to the tomato and the cheese but it had no flavor.

So, Capriotti's, if you are going to try to boost business by sending a really nice offer like a free sandwich, I think you are best served by putting your best foot forward."}
{"text":"In Old Town Scottsdale and want to be treated like crap while sitting at a dirty table wobbling above a filthy floor? This is the place for you. Rudest staff I've experienced in a long time,  especially to get a meh sandwich. Get in your car and drive to The Side Door. Or eat at the tattoo shop next door."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Capriotti's is da' bomb!!!! Hands down, the best samich is The Bobbie. Think of the best Thanksgiving turkey meal you have had, and then put it between two fresh pieces of sourdough bread. NOTE: Get it toasted if you are really feeling frisky. I would seriously get on a plane and fly to Vegas just to have one. The tuna is a close second (IMHO) and the Sausage comes in for the bronze medal. The 20\" is enough for two hearty meals, and a warmed up Bobbie tastes even better on the second day."}
{"text":"Great staff, delicious sandwiches - just make sure to ask for lettuce & tomato if you like your sandwich with a vegi kick!"}
{"text":"3 stars for great sandwiches that I've always loved and wonderful customer service (wish I could give them 5).

I took away two stars because I have been in this location a few times this summer and it is terribly hot inside.  I thought the first time was a fluke but the second time just seemed to be careless management.  I feel terrible for the red faced employees who are OBVIOUSLY uncomfortable.  It's 110 degrees out... Get it together."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite sandwich shop. If you haven't tried The Bobbie yet then you're missing out on probably what is the best sandwich you'll ever try."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT! LOVE that they are open 24 hours. This pastrami blows out The Hat, it is grilled, not boiled. And the Bobby ! Omg, its like thanksgiving in my mouth, I order it without mayo or light mayo because sometimes they over do it. So far all sandwiches I have had here are delicious.  I wish they would open more in California."}
{"text":"My all time fave sub sandwich shop! Capastrami is the way to go! Always fresh and delicious. Original flavored and great quality ingredients."}
{"text":"VEGETARIANS! EAT HERE! 

I've been a vegetarian for nearly 3 years, and the one thing I miss more than anything is a delicious deli sandwich. Capriotti's has filled that void oh so deliciously well. The vegetarian Philly Cheesesteak is delicious. The Veggie Cole Turkey with Russian dressing is killer. They use Morningstar Farms chicken and Worthington's Turkey - it is the best mock turkey I've ever eaten - and you can't buy Worthington's in AZ, so you've got to try it at Capriotti's!

My only annoyance was that I can't get a Vegetarian Bobby. The stuffing has chicken stock in it. What a bummer. You'd think, as veg friendly as they are, that the stuffing would be vegetarian too. Oh well. I'll stick with my Veggie Cole Turkey anyday."}
{"text":"Tried it for my first time today and all I can say is YUM!  Had the Italian 12\" which is easily large enough to share with someone. I added sweet peppers and mayo and it was delicious!!! 100% fresh meat, veggies and the bread was perfect.

I am definitely a fan and will even say it was the best Italian sub I've ever had."}
{"text":"After a 5 mile hike at Red Rock Canyon, my friends and I were starving. After mulling over a few choices for lunch--we ultimately decided that we didn't want anything that would wreck out appetites for our dinner at the Wynn that night.  

Thankfully, our friend recommended Capriotti's.  To be honest--I was definitely looking for some fries and ketchup--but I was open to a lunch that wouldn't undo all the calories I had burned on our 3.5 hour hike.  

Now--I'm not sure if I really did that--because my boyfriend and I ended up splitting The Bobbie.  The Bobbie seemed to be THE sandwich--the money maker--and I didn't have much energy to give my lunch that much thought.  

And thank goodness we ended up with this sub of pure goodness. It's absolutely delicious!  Seriously--It's fantastic!

Pulled turkey stuffed topped with stuffing and cranberry sauce--shoved into a huge mess in an awesome sub.  Money, I tell you! I couldn't be happier--it was simply a Thanksgiving implosion in my mouth.  

What a combination!  Capriotti's is my favorite sandwich spot hands down--and I can't tell you how excited I am to know there's one in LA.  

The Bobbie will definitely make it's way back into my belly again."}
{"text":"Just left the customer service is phenomenal. So much better then the old owners. Food taste better store clean."}
{"text":"Awesome bunch of people work at Capriotti's! They are very friendly, remember your name and regular orders. I go there on average 3 times a week for lunch. My favorite is the tuna sub. I signed up for the club and get offers often to upsize for free."}
{"text":"*Disclaimer - I'm not sure that this was the actual location I went to.  It's either this one or the other one on Sunset.

First and foremost, the fact that I'm giving a sandwich shop 5 stars is pretty impressive.  I'm typically not much of a sandwich person.  Often times I find sandwiches to be kind of boring and really, only eat it if I'm trying to find a healthier alternative to fast food.  Well, let me tell you, Capriotti's is not boring and it's probably not much healthier than a fast food joint.  What Capriotti's is, is delicious (how many times can I use \"is\" in a sentence and still be grammatically correct?).  

I checked this place out while I was out in Vegas through the recommendation of a co-worker who swears by the Bobbe.  Basically a Thanksgiving dinner in sandwich form, it comes packed with real chunks of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/t3AWGr757V4Fvcun6sDsuw?select=K9tLR5HkxU-9tYZ1STmqYw).  Being a huge fan of cranberry sauce on my turkey sandwiches I just had to try it and it definitely didn't disappoint.  The turkey was tasty and not dry, the stuffing was flavorful, and the sandwich had just the perfect amount of cranberry sauce.  It was DELICIOUS!  

I also had a chance to try the cheese steak and a roast beef with coleslaw sandwich.  Both were phenomenally good.  I really wish this place were in California.  Please come to California Capriotti's!"}
{"text":"The turkey sandwich tasted great!! The service was nice and prompt. Well priced as well. 
Why the two stars? My husband and I felt sick to our stomachs after eating it. Didn't throw up but felt like it."}
{"text":"I ordered by phone and my order was ready  when I got there. My Bobbie and mushroom cheese steak sandwiches was great! Very nice and remodeled place. Very clean. Extremely nice workers."}
{"text":"We go to Madison a couple times a year and I think we will probably make this a regular stop going forward.   Service has always been good - it's pretty speedy considering that each time we've gone there has only been one person working and it hasn't taken very long for things to come out.  The sandwiches are enormous and very tasty - the last time we were in, I accidentally ordered a cheese steak sandwich and it was absolutely delicious.  The sandwiches come in various sizes but they are all pretty enormous and very filling.  If you are unfamiliar with the area, it may be a little tricky to get to and on one occasion, while the parking lot is big, was completely full and we couldn't quite figure out why but we ended up finding a spot eventually - well worth it once you get to it!"}
{"text":"2nd visit. first visit, I said never again. second visit worthy of a Yelp review.

ordered a 12.99 roast beef with swiss.

the ordering menu says slow roasted homemade roast beef, pulled.
it was boiled, and boiled to death! it was so dry I added mustard otherwise I would have choked it was stringy, dry, and tasteless.
as for the swiss cheese, sliced so thin I couldnt even hardly find it.

2 visits, NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I found Capriotti's from here on Yelp looking for delivery for lunch at work. Normally I go to Corleones for my cheesesteak, but they're delivery is usually around an hour wait, and I was HUNGRY.

I called Capriotti's to find out how long the delivery time was, and they said only a half hour. PERFECT. I ordered an \"...award winning Cheese Steak\" excited to try it. I added onions and bell peppers, a bag of chips, and patiently waited.

20- 30 minutes later they arrived with my food, which is MUCH quicker than most deliveries in the area. The delivery driver was VERY nice, and quick.

The 12\" was MUCH bigger than i had assumed, it's a lot of food! I was pleasantly surprised to find that the bread was a delicious baguette style and it looked delicious! 

I began devouring my sandwhich, and about two bites in, I realized it was lackluster. The steak they use tasted like it was not seasoned during cooking and tasted like plain old steak. It was a bit bland. It was definitely tender though, which is always a good thing, and I commend them on that because tender steak for cheesesteak is very difficult to do. The cheese was kind of blah, and I much prefer the cheese wiz most places use, but it wasn't bad. All I had to do was add some fresh ground salt and pepper and it spruced it up IMMENSELY.

Overall the food wasn't bad, and I appreciate the FAST delivery. Two recommendations, get cheese wiz ( I understand a lot of people don't like this and that it is a personal preference.) and season the hell out of your meat; possibly even marinade it.

I shall resume my search for the \"Best Cheesesteak in Metro Phoenix\""}
{"text":"I had the Philly Steak Sandwich... It's the best the sandwich I've had in a very very long time. They were quick, the sandwich was really hot, and wrapped very well to keep the heat in."}
{"text":"I have been to two other locations, but I found out there was a new location opening down the street from where I work, so I decided to try them out.  The food is just as good as the other locations, but the location is nicer, and the people are friendlier.

As good as all their food is, their unique subs are the reason to go (Bobby, Capastrami, Cole-Turkey are my favorites).  They are brilliant combinations of ingredients that I would never have tried otherwise, but they all work out really well.

I also have to disagree with a fellow reviewer that their prices are high.  Their small is indeed $7, but their small is 9 inches, and their large (20 inches) is only like $11.  If you are going with someone else, it is definitely more cost effective to just split a large, but with their level of quality (Fresh shredded 'homemade' turkey), even $7 for a 9 inch I don't think is bad at all."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, and mostly liked it.  I'm a lots of veggie type person with my sandwiches, and this place kind of skimps on that.  I also think that if you order anything bigger than the small sandwiches, the price is a little too high for me.  

I've eaten the meatball, and the bobbie and liked both of them.  But as I said before I would love a bigger veggie selection to put on the sandwiches.  I wish the bobbie didn't have so much cranberry, the sweetness overwhlmed the sandwich for me in some places where I cringed at how sweet it was.  Otherwise it was very tasty.

My husband has eaten the meatball and just had a cran-slam club yesterday.  He is not a fan of cranberry but thought on this sandwich it was delicious. 

We'll probably eat here somewhat regularly since he likes it so much."}
{"text":"Make sure to check if the Capriotti's that you're headed to is currently open since some do close early...This one was open a bit later than the others.

Capastrami is really very good!  Husband always gets this one when he's in LV and is craving a sandwich.  The pastrami isn't salty which is a plus and the russian dressing with cole slaw IN the sandwich is a plus! (Why do people ask for the slaw on the side?! Weirdos...)  They are not skimpy on the meat so you get what you pay for! Yay!!"}

Last time at this location.

Edit: huge bone or something in the kids turkey sandwich."}
{"text":"This location is awful. Especially when it comes to making your food correctly when you place an online order. This is now the second time they've made my food wrong with a Postmates delivery. I ordered a cheese sub and they made a cheesesteak with no cheese. Makes no sense...It's like they don't even try. Save your time and money and go to a different location."}

So we tried it out, and it was delicious. The cheese steak and italian sandwich, really good! Next time I'll try the pastrami."}
{"text":"Just walked in 30 mins ago and it looked like it was closed because no employees were in the front. Mad, I was really craving a sandwich"}
{"text":"Thanks to you, Capriotti's, my boyfriend and I can finally go out for sub sandwiches together.

My boyfriend has been a regular at Capriotti's (both here and Vegas) for years. As a vegetarian, I have a pretty strict \"no sandwich chains\" dining rule. I do not want sliced tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, and mustard on bread for a meal. On his last Capriotti's visit, my boyfriend informed me of the vegetarian-friendly menu. I looked it up online, couldn't wait to try it.

Inside, the Tempe location is more of a cute deli than a subway. The staff was very nice and helpful and the sandwiches were served quickly (the establishment was not busy at the time though). My boyfriend got the turkey sub (his usual) and I got the vegetarian version. On my sub, I got faux turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion (which are so thinly sliced and amazing), pickles, sweet peppers (also amazing) and mustard. I would recommend this combination to any vegetarian looking for a filling and tasty cold sub sandwich.

I noticed some people on here complaining about the pricing. Well, the ingredients here are of a much higher quality and fresher than a subway or quizno's, so in my opinion, it is worth paying a couple extra dollars. My boyfriend loves it because they use shredded turkey instead of deli slices on the subs. I am not sure if I will be able to wait many meals before running over there to try the vegetarian version of the Bobby."}
{"text":"Got my order wrong. Paid $7.50 for a chopped salad that was missing items and the salad was just pieces of iceberg lettuce not chopped. Had it not been delivery I would have brought it back. I usually go to a different location and never had any issues. I guess I will be returning to that location."}
{"text":"The Bobby , turkey , & the tuna sandwich are my go to choices here . The Bobby has to be my favorite though ... it's literally like the best thanksgiving leftovers in your mouth. Can't go wrong with Capriotti's and the staff at this location is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and friendly service!  The Capistrami and cheesesteak are my 2 favorites but all the sandwiches are great here. 

Sign up for the text message deals-you'll be happy you did. 

Forget subway- capriottis is worth the few extra bucks for fresh quality ingredients that you can taste in every bite!!"}
{"text":"Take the \"WE DELIVER\" messages out of your menu and local sign.  Period."}
{"text":"My cheat meal for last week was here! I had the Cole Turkey!!! Which was absolutely phenomenal! I also had a bite of their cheesesteak! And their cheddar and ham hoagie! The cole turkey is still my favorite to this day! It's cole slaw with turkey with a dressing that is basically crack! Good crack!  the cheesesteak was delicious too! It was warm and cheesy and moderate spicy (you could still speak think and enjoy your food spicy). Their prices for their sandwiches and rolls and whatever you want to call them is absolutely reasonable for the great tasting food and quality you get! I will always be a customer for this business! And I do have to add that their consistency between shops is AMAZING! Thank you for making your food fresh and keeping food the same in all your outlets."}
{"text":"This Capriotti's is the best location in Las Vegas. It's very convenient right next to Smith's. The Philly Cheesesteak is the best sub I ever had. The Bobbie is also delicious. The ingredients are fresh and taste great. We took our mechanic there after he repaired our vehicle as a thank you and had Philly's and we weren't disappointed. It was fast, friendly and efficient service. The salads are also yummy! I like the Balsamic Chicken and the Black n Bleu. The quality is much better than Subway's, especially with the meats. There is a nice atmosphere with a flatscreen, the tables are always very clean and there's as many napkins as you could need. The employees are smiling and welcome you as soon as you walk in. My fave place to get lunch."}
{"text":"Saw this place as \"best sandwich in America\".  Sure.  Whatever.

Ordered online, was served after 4 walk-up orders and 20 minutes later.  So basically, if you order ahead, you will get your order 35-40 mins later.  Also, I was the only person of color being served at the restaurant so I had to wonder.  Hope you have better luck."}
{"text":"Boy do they make mean bobby sandwich ! Always love dinner here it is inexpensive and casual . Hits the spot every time that Philly cheese steak taste like it came straight out of Philly . My mouth is watering just thinking about it ! The bread is soft and the meat is tender. The cheese is well cheese scrumptious ."}

Then she goes to take my order and answers her iPhone behind the counter in the food area asks mom to hold on mind you she's asking me order 3 times and i just say you know what take your call it's more important. She gives me some stoned dirty look and. Walks away i think she was genuinely high they were talking amongst them selves behind the counter she was using the f word and what not. WORST EXPERIENCE AT A CAPRIOTIS TO DATE! I come here time to time because i get my car washed in the parking lot.. so I'm sitting waiting for my food that's taking way too long compared to normal. Note your phone is the DIRTIEST THING EVER TO HAVE NEAR FOOD SERVICE. She needs a hair net and to be fired likely she looks like she's the manager at this time no name tag... UNPROFESSIONAL..."}
{"text":"AWESOME SANDWICH SHOP! It reminds me of Bruchis in my home town. My boyfriend is from Delaware which is where Capriottis is based so I'd been eager to try it from everything he had told me. Capriottis certainly didn't disappoint! We split both the cheesesteak and The Bobbie (Capriottis is famous for this sandwhich- shredded moist turkey, chunky cranberry sauce and homemade cornbread stuffing on flaky bread). And if you're really hungry the large size is 18 INCHES!!!

I'm absolutely hooked!"}

{"text":"Great sandwiches.. delivery through grubhub sucks.. I ordered at 9:15PM they closed at 10PM.. they received and accepted my order through grubhub .. the whole time I'm getting updates about how they are preparing my food and even an eta of when it should be delivered.. after waiting passed that eta.. and noticing that one thing said my order will be on it's way and another showing the order as a preorder for the following day I called to see what was going on ..  this is an hour later .. he tells me oh you are the one who just put your order in ? I said an hour ago .. he said yes we were actually closed, and never received anything from grubhub about your order.. we also are unable to cancel it on our end so the driver will call grubhub to cancel .. he was not a very good liar..I ended up calling grubhub to cancel and get the refund not the driver .. it was just very inconvenient after waiting an hour for some food you were never going to get .. don't use grubhub for them after 8:45PM you probably won't get your order ."}
{"text":"Extremely happy with this place! Ordered the large platter for my daughters birthday party. The staff was great and had everything ready on time. I had other things catered at the party and these sandwiches were gone first!"}
{"text":"The chicken cheese steak w/ mushrooms and hot peppers occasionally appears in my dreams.

Always great food and service."}
{"text":"We went to this location this weekend and the service was horrible. I called in my sandwich for pick up & they ignored me. When my sandwich was ready nobody told me & it sat on the counter until I asked. We also saw that the guy making the sandwich didn't use new gloves after cleaning & moving dusty equipment around. I honestly love the sandwiches but this location is horrible. We'll be going to the azure location for sure."}
{"text":"My office is right around the corner so you can imagine when a sign was posted that the best sandwich in America was coming to town I was thrilled. Parking sucked, but the sandwich was fantastic. I had the Bobbie and I liked it so much I told two people. I'm eager to try some of their other sandwiches that didn't make the best list and see how they stack up to my regular spot. Over all I was thoroughly impressed with the food and the atmosphere was pretty nice for your run of the mill sandwich spot. 

Next time I'll remember to walk."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE

This is by far the worst excuse for a sandwich shop, or any restaurant for that matter, that I have ever been to.  I have been here 3 times now and 2 of the 3 have been absolutely awful.  First time was ok, nothing spectacular but at least the food was decent.  The second time was much worse and the third time was the last straw for me.  I ordered a turkey sandwich.  The guy working the register didn't give me change so instead of canceling the transaction and reopening the register he decided to give me money out of his own wallet and told me \"he'd make it up in tips\".  OK.  Also told me to get a free drink for the inconvenience, which I declined.  Literally 4 more people came in, ordered, and all got their sandwiches (1 of which was wrong so he also was offered a free drink for inconvenience) before I got mine.  Two of the orders before me were hot so they had to cook on the flattop.  I spoke up and asked what the deal was.  Everyone looked at each other like I was the crazy one when finally a guy, who I'm assuming was the manager, appeared from the back and gave me a refund upon my request.  Two out of three times these morons messed up my order and I will never eat here again.  I tell all my friends and coworkers not to eat here and now I am telling you DO NOT EAT HERE.  

I would give this rat hole zero stars if possible.  Look around and you will see filthy floors, grease stains behind the cook station, public restrooms where they prepare the turkey.  The restrooms are literally in the kitchen.  You have to walk thru the prep station to use them.  Are you kidding me?  How is this sanitary?  This place and all of the people who work here disgust me.

Finally, if the owner or store manager somehow comes across this post I would highly recommend a turnover in employees because the ones who work this store are incompetent and are also costing you money by handing out free drinks and not zeroing out register transactions.  

DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"Located just west of Las Vegas Blvd on Sahara near the Red Label Lounge, this Capriotti's location is easily accessible from the strip. The shopping plaza that it sits inside of might make you raise an eyebrow, but it's actually a pretty nice nice place inside and the staff is all all very friendly.

 They have vegetarian offerings on the menu that don't feel like a meat sandwich minus the meat (the vegetarian cheese steak is my favorite) so it's quickly become my favorite place to grab a quick bite for lunch."}
{"text":"When I'm hungry I never crave sandwiches. I just feel like its one of those things that I can make at home for much cheaper. BUT i have to admit, Capriotti's is pretty good. The samples sound simple and the menu is limited, but their sandwiches are SOO tasty! Plus I love their huge sizes. A sandwich can feed 3 or 4 people if you're not a big eater. Definitely a stop when you roll into town!"}
{"text":"Great, friendly, and fast service during the lunch rush.  Bobbie sandwich was everything I wanted it to be.  Beats eating lunch in the smokey casino across the street easily."}
{"text":"The DE store, the original, was THEEE best. You can forget this one. Nothing extra or special about it. Just a sandwich with Italian dressing."}
{"text":"I had the mushroom cheese steak sandwich and it was ok but not great. I split my sandwich in half so I could eat the rest later and I'm just not that excited about finishing it. It could just be that I'm not a huge fan of greasy food. I would probably not go here again."}
{"text":"Swear there only attractive people who work here. God bless.

The workers are always quick and friendly, and I absolutely love the homemade turkey sub. 

It is the cleanest location i've been to. I usually sit in this one because it's always quiet and calm. 

It's conveniently located by the campus which I love!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable sandwiches! Tried their world famous Bobbie & Capistrami subs and both were outstanding! Heard a rumor that they're opening a location in San Diego in the very near future... Give this place a try if you're not yet familiar with the Capriotti sandwich shops, they're the BEST!"}
{"text":"Capriottis... love it. such a Vegas treasure... even though they opened one in the LA area... well, more specifically in the 90210, it's just not the same. It's simply not as good. I get the the Capastrami.... pastrami, russian dressing, slaw & swiss cheese combined in sandwich genius & greatness. It's a very good sammich. Get the 20\"... Might as well splurge. Save it for later or give half to someone. It'll make their day. 

Service is super friendly here at the Paradise location across from the Hard Rock & in the same plaza as Undefeated & Stussy.

Capastrami.... See you in September."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must-try if you're in Vegas.  I usually stop by before I start heading back home.  It's sort of weird because when I put the address into my GPS, it led me to the wrong place, but I eventually found it.  The store is small and the workers are really nice.  A downside is that they don't have seating here.  When I went, my friends and I just walked across the lot to the Del Taco and sat there and ate our sandwiches.

Everything is made to order.  Most of their sandwiches come in three sizes - small 9\", medium 12\", or a large 20\".  They offer a bunch of different sandwiches in different categories, such as Cap's specials, cold subs, hot stuff, and vegetarian.  I love their cheese steak sandwich.  I order mushrooms with it too and it tastes amazing.  I get the medium size and usually I can only finish half of it because I can't finish the rest, which is alright because I have something to eat if I get hungry on the ride back.  The medium sized cheese steak is $8.25, but if you add mushrooms, it's another $0.50.  So the total is a little under $10.  I've only tried the cheese steak one, but my friends love the Bobbie sandwich, which is actually their best-seller.  My friends actually buy a couple of Bobbie sandwiches so they can put in the fridge when they get home and have something to eat later on in the week.

This place is definitely worth trying.  It's cheap and the food's great."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches. If you are ever craving some Thanksgiving loving, theres a perfect sandwich you! Pretty much T-giving in the palm of your hands, its the one and only Bobbie! Thy are also super fast, friendly, and the place is really clean."}
{"text":"This review is for the location not the food. It seems kind of rough to me...including: the ex worker who came in and stated that if she was still working there no one would be smoking... they would be back here doing the dishes and cleaning the floor to the overall cleanliness or lack there of everything else. The window, walls, door, etc...need to be cleaned. I would think with the corporate headquarters in Las Vegas you would not find a store/location in this condition...it didn't get this way overnight."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I love that it's vegetarian friendly! I think I've ordered every vegetarian option they have, the most recent being  the Veggie Cole Turkey. I think it might be my favorite. The mock turkey they use is divine and the coleslaw & Russian dressing are so tasty! 

The staff is always super friendly and the service is always quick. Prices are a little higher than what you'd pay at any other chain sub shop, but that's not really a con to the place. The quality of the ingredients make it worth the price. And you get a lot for what you pay for. A small is more than filling! 

A few things I wish they would change is the fact that they use so much paper to wrap their sandwiches. It's quite wasteful and I feel like my small sandwich wrap paper takes up the entire table. Also, I really wish they would have a Veggie Bobby on the menu! I'm sure many vegetarians who eat there probably feel the same way."}
{"text":"I've already reviewed the location on Mill Ave in Tempe, however I recently moved and this location is supa close to my house. 

I love Capriotti's and was so excited that a new location opened up in Old Town a few months ago. The service is always friendly, and everyone seems happy to be there! 

I've tried every one of the vegetarian selections. My favorite has to be the Veggie Turkey Cole. So, so delicious. Coleslaw and Russian dressing (which I must say is the only time I've had this kind of dressing)? SOLD. The prices are a little more expensive than other chain sub places, however a small is a whopping 9 inches. It's definitely enough to fill you up. The ingredients always taste fresh. 

I also like how this is connected to an Everything Bagels, although I have yet to try them. 

As with my last review, I really wish they would get a veggie version of The Bobbie already! Who do I have to talk to for this?"}
{"text":"My go to sandwich shop on my trips east I go for GENO's in Philly. My go to sandwich shop on the west coast now is CAPRIOTTI'S!!! My best friend who has lived in Vegas most of his life, swears by this sandwich shop, so I decided to stop by on a recent trip to Vegas from Los Angeles. Having never been there I researched their menu and the Bobbie always seemed to pop up in every conversation. When I got there I wasn't in the mood for turkey so I got the next best thing the Capastrami: hot pastrami on what seems like a french bread type loaf, russian dressing, and coleslaw

There are different sizes and that will determine your price: you can order a small (9'' about $5-7 bucks I believe, medium (12'' about $6-9) , or large (20'' i believe about $12 or so)

I was hungry but I wasnt HUNGRY so I decided on the medium size...

Sandwich: The capastrami was AWESOME! The creamy coleslaw paired with the slight natural saltiness of the pastrami was AMAZING. The russian dressing was just an added plus.

Got a side of chips and an bottled ice tea. The chips were just ordinary bag of chips went well with the sandwich. 

Learned they opened a location closer to home in Beverly Hills, CA ...so can't wait to go as matter of fact planning a trip for thursday hahhaa."}
{"text":"This location delivers lunch to our office from time to time.  The sandwiches are always decent and plenty of condiments. The salads are also well prepared and fresh.   Judging by the wild swings from 1 star claiming horrible service and skimpy sandwiches to 5 star claiming amazing service and the sensational Bobbie, I think it just depends on who is working that day as to your experience.  

I don't care for Russian roulette dining experiences so I doubt I will go there on my own.  There are some fantastic and consistent sandwich shops here in the valley to spend money at.   If we have a lunch meeting and this is what is ordered, well then I guess that is what I will eat."}
{"text":"Bleh.  

The staff has to be the most uninterested group of people ever.  The place was quiet when we arrived. The food was passable but nothing special.  We had a meatball sub, the house specialty turkey sub, and a chicken club.  

The three sandwiches, three bags of chips and three drinks were almost 40 bucks.  Now for a first rate deli sandwich I can understand it but this place was just barely one step above Subway with less enthusiastic employees.  

I wish this place was better than it is but sadly, my quest for a good sandwich shop in the south end of the city will continue."}

It is relatively slow, but I've always been fine with it because the sandwich is so good. The last time I was there I ordered a cheesesteak (my fav) and the person taking my order said I should reconsider because a hot sandwich would take about 25 min. She suggested a cold sandwich instead. I ordered a cold sandwich then waited, and waited, and waited. I timed it. Not only did it take 31 minutes for my cold sandwich, people who had ordered hot sandwiches after me got their food. I complained and the women was so rude to me it was unbelievable. She said my sandwich was hard to make. It wasn't even what I wanted in the first place. Bottom line, poorly managed, poorly trained, expect long waits and do not complain, but at least it is a good sandwich."}

{"text":"now that i know about this place every time i go to vegas this is a sandwich shop for me. I wasn't expecting much but the sandwiches was much better then i expected. Due to the location being off the strip the price is cheaper and worth the side track. I recommend the Capastrami. I don't think of coleslaw being a good sandwich topping but this hot sandwich is in my opinion an awesome combination. Try it out, the place is kind of small and the location is a little out there but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Capriotti's grilled Italian hoagies are delicious. However, they are inconsistent with the way they make the sandwich, which I have noticed over a series of several orders. The order for a hot grilled hoagie should always be:
1. Bread
2. Cheese (melted)
3. Meat slices 
4. Lettuce, tomato, vegetables (cold and crunchy)

NOT bread, then melted cheese with hot soggy lettuce mixed in, then meat on the inside. Ridiculous!

The past three orders I have requested only extra lettuce. Each and every time I have gotten what appears to be a much less than average portion of lettuce. 

Also, this place advertises online to be open 24/7, but there are no lights or obvious signage on the outside of the establishment to show that they are open. I sent my partner to pick up our order and he was confused because this location simply looks dark and CLOSED at night/after midnight."}

{"text":"Just got a yummy sandwich! I got there at 10:02, two minutes after they opened. The girls were friendly and upbeat and my sandwich was done in two minutes. All of the ingredients are fresh, my sandwich is amazing  and overall I'm extremely satisfied with my Bobbi. The only thing it needs is a side of mashed potatoes!"}
{"text":"\"Get the Bobbie if you love America\"
\"Get the Bobbie if you love Thanksgiving\"
\"Best sandwich spot in Vegas\"

So, I got the Bobbie. It sounded like a great sandwich with turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo (I got mustard). Major disappointment. Didn't know it was a cold sub or I would have ordered something else. It's basically your Thanksgiving dinner leftovers tossed between a french roll. The bread wasn't toasted, the cranberry sauce was too sweet, there wasn't enough stuffing, and the veggies I ordered on the side had the freshness of your local Subway. 

Paid $8 and some change for a 12 foot, which isn't bad. But next time I want a sub I'll make my way over to Safeway and make my own. 

Make the Bobbie hot!!! Two stars because the staff was extremely nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"I work close by so I come here about once a month for lunch. This Capriotti's is fairly new and you can tell. The tables, chairs, and floors are all new and clean. Compared to other Capriotti's I have been to, the seating is a lot better and feels more comfortable to dine in. Service is always on point. My favorite sandwiches are the bobby and cheese steak. The large size is 20 inches and the medium is 12 inches. I can usually share a medium with another person. Place is great for catering."}
{"text":"This particular location has been fired. I've been a fan and customer of Capriotti's for 22 years and have been happy to see the business expand like wildfire over time. The service and quality of food at this location has gone downhill and I see no improvement in sight however. My husband and I have given this location numerous opportunities to prove otherwise, but there has been no change. The last several cheesesteaks we've ordered contained meat that was fatty and grisly, let alone any meat at all. Seems like they've cut portions in half of what they've previously served. I think they've changed the type of turkey they serve as well. Tastes different. And be careful that you don't bite into a piece of bone. That's happened more than once to be a simple one time oops. And don't bother ordering any jalapeño chips. They never have them in stock. You think they'd stock appropriately knowing it sells faster than the other flavored chips."}
{"text":"One of the worst food experiences ever!!!! We ordered food for them to be delivered to Venetian hotel for the amount of 57 dollars and change.  The delivery guy called to tell us he was in the lobby but he wasn't there when we tried to call him his phone wouldn't accept calls. I called the store close to 10 times and they take no responsibility for it and blaming postmate for not delivering it but since we ordered directly from capriotti site postmate can't find our order. Basically took over 2.5 hours of our 3 days trip and put us in a bad hungry mood.  But the worst part is they have never said they were sorry.  And I never got an email in response to mine.  So do your selves a favor and don't have them deliver u food. Now I am disputing the charge through my bank.  What type of professional business is this? Not sure how to add a pic here but I have a pic of my order that says it was delivered and if any problem to contact capriotti and not postmates.  Well the few managers I talked to didn't think that's the case. And btw I don't do many reviews but this one had me mad for 3 weeks now. On top of that the email address the GM gave me didn't work.  I can't rate the food since we never got it but I have had zero fun talking to the managers there."}
{"text":"I love this place.  And that comes even after mistakes were made.  I was already loyal but once my order was not done right.  I brought it back and it was replaced but they refunded my money and gave me vouchers. 
I was clear that it was not a big deal but they insisted."}
{"text":"Online and storefront say they close at 9 on Saturday.  Arrived at 5 minutes til 8, door is locked and lights are out!  Drove 23 miles from Queen Creek!"}
{"text":"Worst Capistrami I've ever had anywhere! Go to Alliante Park instead they got it together!"}
{"text":"Interesting that no one had Done this yet...

Fresh turkey, picked off the bird and shredded, think of pulled turkey.

Fresh and good taste, my sandwich was a little dry,
I mixed the Coke slaw and Russian dressing and still a little dry

Good it was.

I would return.

The disappointment was the beverage choice. Pepsi has 90 percent market penetration in vegas. Do they claim. The fountain soda and limited bottles make it hard. I feel better beverage options craft soda would make a difference.

They have Wise potato chips, but only the big bags. Again Frito products maybe easily accessible, but it make me think of a national chain.

The place has a worn Décor and feels tired. It would feel cool if they had matching snacks.

Dr Browns would be nice.  

I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I wasn't all that surprised how my food turned out. Overall it was a decent sandwich spot. I really recommend other spots to have a sandwich, but this place didn't disappoint because my expectations weren't all that high to begin with.

I ordered the capastrami sandwich. Which was kind of good. Not much to talk about as I said, there's really nothing special about eating at this place."}
{"text":"Mmmmm, not usually a fan of coleslaw but theirs is good!! Went here 2-3 times and got the Capastrimi every single time. Now this is a sandwich that I can't finish since it's huge but it's delicious! I've only ate here when we have cars in vegas and when I'm not on the strip!"}
{"text":"Ok, I have never been to this Capriotti's.  But I did go to the Capriotti's in San Diego, and it was my favorite-hands down sandwich shop of all time!

I am so sad it closed.

This place had amazing bread.  
It had a vegetarian turkey, that tasted amazing (not the stuff you buy in stores).  
They always put a spice mix on your sandwich, which made it 200% better.

And, it was cheap.

You could get a 20 inch sandwich (I AM NOT KIDDING), for under $15.  I used to split this with my boyfriend.  It was cheaper than the small-9 inch and it was a whole inch more of food.

Everyone should go to every Capriotti's."}
{"text":"I am really confused as to why everybody is orgasming over these sandwiches. They're really not packing a punch in the flavor department.

I've had Capriotti's twice - once at a party and again last night (8/24/11)  at this location with my friend Jerry J. after we got off work. He got a meatball marinara sandwich and I got a small Bobbie. Flavorless. If there was some sort of gravy, it would offset the dryness of this sandwich. It's seriously missing some component that would blow this sandwich out of the water. There's a reason that we don't eat Thanksgiving dinner sandwiched between a baguette - the bread overpowers the flavors and makes it too bland. As we sat out by the GVR pool, Jerry confirmed that his sandwich was bland and disappointing. Meh.

The service was fine, but honestly, the sandwiches are much better at Subway, Quiznos and even Togos (California chain.)

Don't buy into the hype, you can make a better sandwich at home."}
{"text":"Love this place. Employees are always great and food comes out quick. The Capistrami is the best sub I've ever had"}
{"text":"John is the bomb. He hooked me up on the best sandwich ever when I needed it the most. The Batman of sandwich artists"}
{"text":"Ordered a Capastrami for delivery with the dressing on the side. The restaurant called to ask if I meant extra dressing on the side, or no sauce on the sandwich, only the side. I informed them the latter. When my order arrived, there was no sauce either on the sandwich or on the side. Contacted the restaurant and informed them of such, to which they told me they would have their driver bring it back out. I received a call about 15 minutes later stating that they apologize, but they manager Ronnie said they could not send a driver out to deliver only the sauce (which THEY forgot) They said I could go pick it up, or they could give me a discount on my next order. Why should I go out of my way to fix their mistake,  and why would i want to order from such a poorly run establishment again?The fact that management is telling them not to correct their own mistakes is plain bad business."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday night, the service was excellent. While they closed in an hour they did not give that \"closing\" service. They were very accommodating. It was my first time at a Capriotti's and the cashier took time to explain the menu and sandwiches as well as give great suggestions.
I went with the chicken philly with sweet, hot, and green peppers. It was literally BOMB!!!! Loved it and will be returning for another one. I wish I could remember the name of the cashier but I was so focused on the food, forgot to look or ask."}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop in the universe. Cant add much to that. The Bobbie, Capristrami, Cheesesteak. I have been here a month, and have been to Capriotis at least 8 times. Great bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop. Like subway only better! Great combinations. Fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Great made to order sandwiches! The cheesesteak is my favorite, but I haven't had a bad sandwich yet. Price may see a little high, but the size of the sandwich makes up for it. Will be back."}
{"text":"I love love love the capistrami!  I know a lot of people are fans of the Bobbie, but I just don't like it.  I also really like the philly cheese steak and appreciate that everything is made to order.  Save time by calling ahead so your sandwich is ready when you get there!"}
{"text":"So freaking good!! Seriously, I could eat the Bobby everyday of my life. They use turkey breast like thanksgiving turkey and its amazing! Their customer service is great and they are crazy fast!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's, just like I remembered from Vegas adventures past.  I was just talking about this place when in North Idaho and I saw a Subway commercial for a knockoff \"The Bobbie.\"  Screw that noise.  My company shipped me to Scottsdale and I needed a sandwich tonight.  Capriotti's came through with a bomb sammich!"}
{"text":"OMG.

A friend of mine had been raving about this place for months, and he finally talked me into going there a week ago. 

It was late at night, and there were 2 very attentive people on staff. 

I ordered the \"Slaw Be Joe\", which is shredded roast beef, russian dressing, provolone cheese, and mountains of cole slaw.  I'm not a big cole slaw fan, so I had my reservations, but it was awesome. 

I ordered a medium sized sandwich (I forget how many inches it is), and it was HUGE.  The slaw was cold, sweet, crisp and fresh. The meat was tender and juicy, and the bread fresh and toasty.  

My friend got \"The Bobby\" which is basically a thanksgiving dinner in sandwich form. Turkey, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce, and possible gravy and cheese. I'm not sure, since I only had a bite, but the bite I had was delicious. 

Portions huge, food tastes great, prices very right."}
{"text":"The Capistrami is my favorite sub sandwich. I get it every time I go to Capriotti's. I was a little disheartened at the meat portion, were smaller than I normally accustomed to seeing at some of the other retail locations:
- Sahara&Durango, Las Vegas, Nevada
- Irvine Blvd &  jamboree, marketplace, Irvine California
- MacArthur & Dove, Irvine, California
- Tustin marketplace, Tustin, California.

After writing this review I went to Capriotti's website and they have closed all the Capriotti's retail locations in orange county. Bummer :("}
{"text":"This place is on-poooooooooint.  Our first stop in Vegas before the Gold & Silver, was for food.  Even at 10:30 a.m., Cap-o's was husslin' and busslin'.  I had never been before, so it felt good to know that they had enough business to employ like 14 cooks at such an early hour.  They do a huge catering/to go business, but they also have a dine in area.  The restaurant is clean and comfortable.  This was the perfect start to our Vegas vacation.

The Capastrami is dope: Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian dressing and cold slaw.  Christina had the homemade turkey sandwich, I had a bite - delicious. 

You can't go wrong with this place.  

Out - Sixton"}
{"text":"Fabulous sandwich shop with incredibly friendly employees. I enjoyed my sandwich and soda and was also able to purchase TastyKake items (which I took home much to the delight of my family).

The owner is great. He is super friendly and customer service oriented. 

I've enjoyed my experience every time I have been to this shop."}
{"text":"Great assortment of sandwiches prepared fresh for any palette!  My favs include the cheesesteak, Bobbie, capastrami and the Italian.  I recommend calling in since all sandwiches are made to order so there is minimum wait time especially during busy hours.  Many locations to chose from so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and pretty good service.  I return to various locations occasionally and it's fairly consistent.  Love the pastrami with coleslaw...yummy!"}
{"text":"4.5 for me. the bobbie and capastrami are freakin awesome! my friend and i split two 12 inchers, no pun intended, and we decided on those sammiches, mmmmmmmmmmmm!!!

i tried the capastrami second, but i'm saving the best for last: this was delish! serious party in my mouth. the hot pastrami, swiss cheese, cole slaw and russian dressing, omgosh! really great flavors, your taste buds won't hate you for this one. i just wish that maybe they toasted their bread a bit?! i dunno, i like it the way it is, but i think a hot bun would make it even better.

now onto the bobbie: hot damn! whoever thought of putting thanksgiving  dinner in a sammich?!?! so delish! who gives a fcuk if you're on a diet or one of those low carb shits, this sammich will make you change your mind about going low card ever again.

warning: it is vegas, you might end up putting all this in the toilet, the way it came in. at least it's got the cranberry so it has pretty colors for you to stare at and regret how much you've had to drink!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good like always. The cashier should repeat back the order and limit the conversation between co workers that isn't business related while taking an order. Those things might have prevented my child's sandwich being missed during the order process ."}
{"text":"We received this through Door Dash. The sand which bread was dry and hard. It was only more disappointing to find the signature sand which the Bobbie to have dry stuffing that just fell off the sand which and lacked flavor. The turkey on the sand which was also dry and lacked any flavor. The cheese steak sand which appeared to have been what was left after someone else ate it. One of the three sandwiches was good and that was the grilled Italian. The soup was meh.... the little dry buns that come with soup were kinda like why? We thought that we were gonna really like these sandwiches but alas I fear we will not be repeat consumers in this office."}
{"text":"The place wasn't very clean, there were bugs crawling on the drink machine, floor was dirty, and their credit card machine was down. I orders the handmade turkey sandwich small (9in) with lettus, oions, chesse, crushed peppers,  the sandwich was bland, had no taste, I orders Chipotle ranch on the side with had enough flavor to get me through the sandwich."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steaks here will knock you backwards.  

Perfectly seasoned, moist Italian beef smothered in melting motz ( yeah, it ain't prov), sweet and tangy pickled peppers stuffed in-between, and beautifully crusty / chewy bread sopping up all the goodness.  

Great sandwiches, period."}
{"text":"I really love their sandwiches.  The meat they use is fresh, definitely not deli style on their specialty sandwiches.  It is one of my favorite places to get a sandwich that is worth anything...nothing else compares to the quality."}
{"text":"Ok, I admit it...this place wasn't my choice and I was skeptical, but I went along with the crowd...I was wrong.  I'd never heard of Capriotti's and saw it was a chain, but I'm glad we stopped here. The guy taking our order was quick and friendly and moved the line along. 

I'm a big fan of places that use real turkey in sandwiches instead of deli meat and when I saw The Bobbie on the menu I knew I had to get it. Turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo on a fresh roll?!?  What's not to like?  The guys with me ordered another Bobbie, a cheesesteak, and a turkey and cheese sub. 

The food came out very quickly (surprised at lunchtime) and the place was pretty clean.  Prices were reasonable and here's the best part...the food was really good. I'll be honest, I would have liked mine to have been hot, but it was delicious just the same. The others in my group also liked their sandwiches, though the turkey sub came with onions when he asked for no onions. I'd certainly eat at a Capriotti's again, but it isn't likely as there aren't any back home."}
{"text":"Very disappointing... expecially for the price.  I ordered a turkey sandwich, my husband the cheesesteak.  Our bill with a couple of sodas was $24.  Ouch!  The cheesesteak was pretty forgettable.  I would go to Uncle Sam's - theirs are much better.  The turkey sandwich was pretty awful.  The turkey had lots of dark meat and was finely shredded.  The texture reminded me of canned pet food.  I initially thought the sandwich had been made with tuna by mistake.  The too-sweet russian dresssing didn't help matters.  Save yourself some money and get a better sandwich at Jimmy John's.  Their service is much quicker, too."}
{"text":"I have had an error in every order placed at this restaurant. Five for five now. The first four orders were online, so this time I went in and ordered. I was clear - kids ham and cheese plain - just ham and cheese. Guess what? No cheese. Same for the other kids turkey and cheese. No cheese. That's a waste of my money. The online orders for the sandwiches were messed up too. Again, a plain turkey and cheese ends up with tomato and mayonnaise. The kids sandwiches don't come with tomato!!! Another order had no chips - which I ordered. I can accept an error on my sandwich, but when you screw up my kids meals, it shows a major lack of caring. If I didn't enjoy the Bobbie so much, I would never go back to this store. The 2nd star is for the Bobbie. I want my tip money back."}
{"text":"We frequent this place on a weekly basis. We go there so much, I even have their rewards app on my phone.
Even though they have a few choices, I always get the cheesesteak, I am addicted to that sandwich.  My husband loves their Cole Turkey Sandwich the vegetarian one, they use a soy product that tastes just like turkey....I mean it's pretty good, but I can't give up my cheesesteak."}
{"text":"This is...tough. I live close to the strip and go to the location on flamingo often and lawd have mercy the roast beef is just the best. So I'm up at a friends place near this location and I got a hankering for that roast beef. I go. I get home. Open sandwich. Soggy as can be honestly but I love me some mustard and their bread can hold up. First half is fire. That beef is on point. I go to the next half of the medium sub and I'm wondering if they pulled a damn Houdini on me. No beef. I still ate it honestly because the bread is fire. But like how about putting meat on both halves of the sandwich? They were a bit busy I get it but I'd prefer to wait a bit longer for a quality product. I still will be frequenting other locations. But that beef is still amazing."}
{"text":"As I was just rating a different location for a very poor experience, I realized that I haven't given a well earned positive for this location. The food is always on point I love the roast beef sandwich but all are very good honestly. The staff is very nice and the chips they stock are fire. Honestly I just wish I had that recipe for that roast beef. I'll be stopping by every time I'm in Vegas once I move."}
{"text":"Great find! We stumbled on this place expecting normal sandwich fare but were pleasantly surprised at the unique menu and vegetarian options. Our party had the Bobbie, veggie cheesesteak, veggie cheese sandwich and kids had grilled cheese on wheat bread served with juice& a snack of cranberries. The bread was very soft, fresh ingredients. Small touches like the plates they were served on were nice. Clean restaurant."}
{"text":"So I've eaten here several times and have usually enjoyed the experience and the food. Today I called ahead, and when I walked in the order wasn't ready, the place was empty and two kids were just standing there. One kid hurried and made the sandwich, the stuffing was complete mush. We asked for a free brownie to make up for the fact that they hadn't even started the sandwich and the kid asks, \"Do you want the brownie or not?\" Didn't even attempt to compensate. So after choking down the first half of the sandwich, the three kids walk out of the store to go smoke or whatever. We ask if anyone is here, and a guy from the back comes out and says, \"I'm here, let me know if I can help with anything.\" We explained our concerns and he agree. He made a new sandwich and it was up to par with what we expect when we come here, AND he gave us a free brownie. He saved this review and brought it up to 3 stars. Thank you. We'll be back."}
{"text":"First time .. It was really good. Soft bread. Very filling. I only had a small bite left but didn't want to waist it so I bucked up and ate it lol

Definitely coming back and only walking distance from my home :)"}
{"text":"Probably the only fault of them is they don't have LATE LATE night hours and they're not RIGHT on the strip.

My recommendation is the Capistrami.  Get the large (20\"), cut it in half (two 10\" sandwiches) and share with somebody.  Nice bread... SUPER tasty pastrami... but the coleslaw on it is where it's at.  Good cold crunch that keeps you coming back for the next bite quicker than you thought you would.

Never really busy... a lot of locals order to go, so they just come in, pay, leave.  So plenty of seating for us out of towners.

It's in a VERY tiny strip mall near the corner of Sahara and The Strip."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for takeout 4-16-15 at 6 PM.
  **CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE***
Young female with orange hair, freckles, and heavy makeup made my food. 
I had:  
-A small bobbie ($6.60)- You can't go wrong.  I gave an extra star just for this sandwich. White roll, stuffing, cranberry, turkey, and mayo.  
-Cap's creation salad ($5.99 +$1.00 extra for meat)
THEY FORGOT MY TUNA...didn't notice until I got home. I'm so irritated. 
I asked the gal if they have banana peppers and she said no, but they have sweet peppers.  They were disgusting...imagine green bell peppers made into a sweet pickle.  Bleck! I picked them all off.  
Dressing is T. Marzetti's from an individual pack."}
{"text":"This is not a review based on the food. The food from Capriotti's is great. The problem is every single time I go here they're out of bread. This has happened at least 5 times. Granted at least it's later in the day. It's happened to me twice and 3 other times to other people who come in at the same time I am there. 

The last straw was today. I made an online order and paid online. I get a call saying they're out of bread. They said they couldn't cancel the order until a manager was in tomorrow. I couldn't cancel it online myself, I tried. So I asked if they could just transfer my order to a different location. I was told no. 

I then call a different location to place my order. They happily did it. They had bread! I asked him when I was there if they can transfer orders and he said yes. At the very least they should have called and asked us for bread. Of course the other location didn't do that. 

Again, this is not based on their food. I've always had great food but just bad experiences. I gave it an extra star for the food. Clearly lost 3 due to experiences."}
{"text":"I ordered the food for the first time here and decided to order delivery the lady I called asked me to hold and put the phone down I listened to her take about 15 orders while I waited 10 minutes for her to return to the call. I decided to call back and it has now been 1 hour and 15 minutes later I still had not received my food. I called to see what was wrong and told them it had been going on two hours I've been trying to eat and they need to do something. He had no sympathy for me and told me they got the address wrong ect. Horrible customer service and I'm still paying for this. Bad service wouldn't recommend delivery for anyone. Very poorly run."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich shop! Not the best atmosphere but I was there for a good sandwich and that is found. The friendly folks behind the counter made me feel welcome. Will be heading back."}
{"text":"I had the capastrami here and I absolutely loved it. The pastrami has a lot of flavor and the slaw and dressing complement it well without overpowering it. The bread is also nice and soft, which is a nice added touch. I also had a bite of my brother's bobbie sandwich, which is basically the sandwich you make with leftovers the day after thanksgiving. While it's good, it was nothing too special, which was especially disappointing because the worker strongly recommended the bobbie."}
{"text":"I love their food, but service consistently sucks.  I can't tell you how many times I've called in my order and they don't have it done.  Today was no exception.  Called in an order at 10:30 am, well before the lunch rush. Arrived 20 min later and they had not even started my order!  There were no other customers and they were not busy cooking any other orders.  They were just standing around talking.  They finally noticed me and said, \"Sorry, we didn't notice the ticket.\"  What?!  This place is the size of a coffin.  How do they not know there's an order?"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are pretty good but the morons that run this place make it the process of getting a sandwich unbearable.  I called to place a pickup order at 8:40 and the lazy kid on the phone said no more orders cause they were closing. This place needs a manager to come in and clean out the current staff. I'LL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I'm from where Capriotti's originated, Newark, Delaware.  Capriotti's is an institution there; people have been keeping them very busy for generations.  What used to be a small family business was bought out by a young guy in Vegas who has been expanded the franchise to the Southwest (thank you!!!!!!!).
Until recently, Arizona's only Capriotti's was located in Ahwatukee, on Chandler Rd & 48th St by I-10.  The owner recently told us Phoenix should be getting more locations soon; their website announces that they are now in Mesa on Baseline.  I'm hoping the Northwest valley will get some love soon -- we're hungry, too!!  
HOW GOOD IS IT?!  My Mom used to live in Glendale and we would drive down to Phoenix's only location, in Chandler!  I currently live NW, have been back in Phoenix for 5 months -- we've already been twice.  Now that I'm typing all of this, the seed is in there and I'm sure we'll head down to Capriotti's again soon.  ;)
Here's the skinny: They are LEGENDARY for the Bobbie, aka Thanksgiving in a roll.  A soft, fresh roll filled with shredded turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo -- perfection.  The cheesesteaks are done right - and I often drove up to Philly for Pat or Geno's.  I know my cheesesteaks.  I also recommend the mushroom cheesesteak (with provolone).  The only sandwich improvement I could make would be to add the Cheeze-Whiz option, like Geno's and Pat's in Philly.  The subs are fantastic - lettuce shredded to perfection, awesome lunchmeat, soft rolls...  My favorite is the Italian.
Capriotti's awesomeness is due to the high quality of ingredients.  Fresh rolls are locally baked and delivered daily.  The lunchmeat is superior, Chandler's staff is friendly, the restaurant is spotless, and the food is made right in front of you.  There are a few tables inside and I think a picnic table outside.  
Perfect food for tailgating, a day on the boat, picnics - and they cater!  If it weren't for Capriotti's, I wouldn't be able to find one decent cheesesteak or sub in Phoenix - and especially not a Bobbie!  THANK YOU, CAPRIOTTI'S, FOR FEEDING ME WELL!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the grilled Italian. Is was good, very greasy but I guess that is expected with Italian meats. My only complaint really is that it overpowered the rest of the sandwich. I did enjoy the sweet n hot peppers but that is about all I tasted. I will be back but I think next time I might stick a cold sandwich and compare. Everyone here did seem like they enjoyed there job which is nice to see. Even tho not 100% satisfied I'll be back."}
{"text":"Surprised to find this sit down, eat in sandwich shop with no toilet facilities for its customers! Just wondering how this meets Clark County health laws?  I thought all restaurants had to provide a bathroom with hot water for their customers. 
 

Every time I'm in here, I find that all the tables are dirty and needing a wipe down.  And they have the tip bowl out looking for donations?

The sandwiches are very good though, if you get them takeout."}
{"text":"This review is for take out.
AdmittedlyI have never been to the actual shop...
This is also my 1st and 2nd time tasting a sub sandwich

My kids laugh when I call them \"submarine\" sandwiches...
They look like submarine's...

Both times my vegetarian \"turkey\" sandwich were so good I ate the whole thing...

I told myself in my head a 100x... save half, save half...
Nope ate it all!!

Here they are coming to the bay...1st one open in S.J. now!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's sandwiches are so delicious. I usually go with the Philly or meatball and both are always hot and super filling. 

Have had the soup and that was on point as well. 

This location is always clean and quick. No complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"Fairly average sandwiches. I mean, it's meat on bread., with onions and whatever else. If you're into that, you'll enjoy it."}
{"text":"Bad customer service. No one will greet you.I stood at the register ( 3 feet from a worker ) and it was still awhile before someone acknowledged me. It's a good thing the sandwiches are so delicious or this location would go outta business. Try another location for the same sandwiches."}
{"text":"The grilled Italian cannot be beat. Like seriously. Take a group of people who don't want sandwiches and open one of these bad boys up in front of em.... boom! Suddenly everyone is ordering sandwiches. Like magic."}
{"text":"I ordered lunch yesterday and waited all through my lunch break for a sandwich. They didn't get my sandwich done so I went back to work and finished out the day with no lunch. Talked to my coworkers and they said they've had similar experiences at this location. Several other negative reviews along these same lines, you would think they'd work it out."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a Capriotti's sandwich on this Vegas trip, since I had been hearing it about it for a while. After driving 3.5 hours, it was fast approaching lunch time and we were about ready to gnaw our arm off. After punching in the address on the GPS, we found ourselves in another run-down strip mall off Sahara. The blackened storefront windows didn't exactly give the wife a vote of confidence. Relaaaax, I told her. You can stay in the car, if you want to... nope, she bolted right out.

I was surprised the place was dead empty except for a creepy-looking dude who looked like he was enjoying his sandwich a little too much. I opted for a Capastrami and she got the homemade turkey sandwich. This was our first visit, so we got the \"small\" for around $6.50 each. When our food was ready, I was relieved that we didn't get ripped off by some dinky looking sub-sandwich. 

The Capastrami was good, nicely balanced with the coleslaw, Russian dressing, and pastrami. The pastrami isn't your thinly sliced type from the Hat, or of the thick-variety from some classic NY deli like Katz's. It was more of a hybrid of both, and I only wish there was more of it in my sandwich. The soft bread roll helped to sop up the juiciness and slight tangy-ness from the slaw. 

I was good, not overly stuffed to the point of food coma, but I was good until dinner. The small sandwich definitely filled me up at the good price. I can only imagine the amount of the food for a larger portions. Call me a fan, as I definitely want to try some other sandwiches. It's no Earl of Sandwich, but I'd take this over something like Subway/Quiznos/Jersey Mike's any day of the week."}
{"text":"As a rule, I love Capriotti's but, this particular location is absolutely terrible! I ordered a Cheese steak sandwich (2 actually, one for me and the other for my son) and I can confidently report that this was the worst cheese steak I have ever had!!! The bread tasted old and starchy, the meat was way overdone, telling me that it was probably days old and was so gross that I ended up throwing it away! What a Complete disappointment."}
{"text":"Really good refreshing sandwich. I got ham (I get that everywhere) and this is the best so far! Really nice staff as well thank you!"}
{"text":"I have ate at capriottis once before but I don't remember getting two pieces of ham and bad tomatoes.. I'll stick to the one on rainbow that one is super yummy. The bread was dry as well.. I actually am sitting here in the restaurant. And can't finish the 2nd half of my sandwich... I won't be back to this location"}
{"text":"This capriottis I feel always has great customer service, sure they messed up my order but they let me keep the mess up AND upsized my soup for the inconvenience. The gentlemen who helped us (Savino) was sincere and polite."}
{"text":"Slowest service took me about 30 mins to get a damn sandwich. That's beyond crazy I go to other locations and never takes this long"}
{"text":"O M G!  Capastrami is the best sub I've ever had in my life!  So soft and mushy all at once!!  Yum-mmmmyyy!!

We also ordered the Homemade Turkey Sandwich (brown bread).  That was delicious, too.  

For sandwiches, you can order brown bread.  Unfortunately, they don't have brown bread for their subs.

Take out is probably the best.  Washed our sandwiches and subs down with Sweet Ice Tea.  

If you ever stayed down in the south end of the strip by Southpointe, they would deliver as well."}
{"text":"It was very good first time here and next time in Vegas will make sure we stop again. You should try this place"}
{"text":"Had the Capristrami Subs - Delicious!  We shared a 12\" and a 9\" amongst 3 people and it was more than enough.  Cheap and resaonable and taste sooooooo good!  

That's neat that there is a Capriotti's in the food court of the Green Valley Ranch Casino Resort.  Very convenient and quite affordable."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had in a sandwich shop. 

We got a coupon for a free sub in the mail. So we gave it a try. Walked into the store and grabbed a menu. My group and I were never greeted. 
The menu fails to tell you what half of the subs have for ingredients. Annoying. Also there is no sneeze guard to see and choose your ingredients, just a divider wall with secrets. 

After standing at the counter for 5 mins they finally decide they can take time and get our order. The employee wasn't to happy about that. 

The order is in. As we are waiting for our food, I look around the area we are sitting in. I don't think they have ever actually cleaned that place. Everything in there was a complete mess. 

Our food took over 20 mins. 20mins! That to me is outrageous considering that it's just a sub. 
The food was decent. Yet I have had much better subs for less $$$. 

Bottom line, I would not go back here or recommend it. 
You can drive to a Henderson sub shop, get your food and drive back to boulder in less time for less money for better subs."}
{"text":"Love the bobbie!
Comes with turkey, cranberry sauce, and stuffing.

Bread is fresh and soft.

Open 24 hours, so it's very convenient if you're at the Hard Rock Hotel.

Prices are a tad high, but it's worth it.

Got a 9\" for around $7.50.

They even have large bags of chips available if you brought a big group of people to eat with."}
{"text":"They are always friendly and the food is great. We ordered the Capture 2 deal today. Great deal.  We will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Best and closest Philly cheesesteak ever . They even add the sauce correctly after I asked them too and had the correct ingredients to add as well. Anothernall busness that I well worth the visit. Service was great and friendly they even had chips you can get back east . Really pleased and highly recommend this to everyone."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with the Bobby. The first time I heard about this sandwich I thought it was discussing, until I tried it. Now every time I go Vegas I want to get one."}
{"text":"New location, clean, prompt service and very friendly.

The location offers soup, salad and sandwiches.. 

Walked in, I was greeted immediately and they promptly took my order. Food was on the table within about 5 minutes.. great experience for lunch."}
{"text":"Cleanliness: 5 Stars
The front of the restaurant boasts a brand new concept and feel for the chain. Everything is clean and orderly, as an added bonus they have a dedicated staff member keeping the lobby area clean. 

Hospitality: 5 stars
Taking the time to explain their new salad bar option, and also making recommendations on classic options.

Food: 5 Stars
The portions are large and made fresh to order. All our meals were hot and came accurate.

Overall:
This place is great to sit down outdoors or indoors, ample space and wonderful shopping nearby make this location a favorite."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a good sub sandwich.. This location took over a restaurant space a while ago, and this has been the go to spot when I visit Town Square during the day.

The staff is accurate, friendly, and knowledgeable about their menu. The food came out hot and fresh to order. It is great to visit an establishment where the staff loves to be working!

I will continue to patron this location."}
{"text":"A good sandwich, but I didn't think it was the 'second comming' of subs like some think.  As it is 'take out', no bathroom - not a big deal but inconvenient if traveling like we were.  Convenience store next door."}
{"text":"Great to see that everyone here loves Capriotti's as well!  I've been coming here for nearly 3 years now and I'm satisfied every single time.  I usually grab their signature subs.  The bobbie and the capastrami are my two favorites.  Great staff and great prices.  Even if you're not a sub-type guy or gal, they have plenty of sandwiches to choose from -- freshly made every time.  If you live in vegas and havent tried capriotti's.. SHAME ON YOU!"}
{"text":"The bread on these subs is some of the best, the pastrami with creamy coleslaw inside the sub, add sweet peppers and you get...ahmazzzzzing! Just when I thought my SUBLIME SUB cuisine could not get any better, I had a bite of a cheese steak sub with mushrooms...shut the front door and all the windows....daaaaamn this place rocks...you will crave these subs!"}
{"text":"Every time I call this place the phone is busy, when it's not it's some punk kid.  I was a punk kid once so I know what it's like but DANG, TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES.  This is a rich area, get some people who understand that and they'll actually get some good tips.  The food here doesn't taste like the one just down the street on silverado ranch.  I was annoyed that half the kids behind the counter were tatt'd up and dropping F bombs.  I hate to be a tool cause I hated tools as a kid, but customer service really needs some help at this place.  

Only saving grace was the free sports on TV while I waited."}
{"text":"The Bobbie is off da hook!  Hands down a great sandwich!  My girl had the Pastrami,  and she says its the best Pastrami she has ever had!  Need I say more?  No go on,  get your ticket to Vegas and visit this place.  Come on, you can be on the next flight out,  so go now!  Do it!"}
{"text":"The quentissential perfect sandwich, mix some old favs (cheesesteak) with a thanksgiving dinner on a roll (the bobby) and you've got great flavors, great service and yum."}
{"text":"Not a bad sandwich shop. I have been told they were pretty good. Can't complain, they are another average sandwich shop  staff was nice and helped when deciding what to eat. Probably will try again."}
{"text":"Well I have had my fill of bad subs and now crappy attitudes.
My husband bought me a meatball sub from this location, i got home from work late and went to eat it and choked on the insane amount of pepper in the meatballs. I mean my throat was burning. The next day we went in to talk with a manger and what a joke this was. 
This kid comes out not with a hello, or a smile or an introduction, I get what do you want?
Really? 
I explain about the horrendous amount of pepper in the meatballs, and right away he says \"we dont put peppers in our meatballs\" 
So i tell him I said pepper, like black pepper not peppers. Maybe if you would listen to me you would understand. 
He then interrupts again and says \" well i can't remake your sub without the old one, nor can I give you a refund without the receipt\" 
I told him i wasn't looking for a refund which I wasnt, I wanted him to check his food because there was an issue. 
But he could careless, he is just so full of himself because of his title of \"manager\" 
Maybe one day when he grows up he will learn how to be one.
I have learned my lesson, granted i should have known it would be like this since every time I have gone in I have never seen the same face twice, so lack of proper training, and lack of employees who care in general leads to issues every time"}
{"text":"It's a nice place to have lunch by myself during work break. Clean place. Cool employees. Great sandwiches. What else you need!"}
{"text":"They told us the soda machine was broke when in fact it was not we bought the sodas from the refrigerator which cost Waymore also they did not give us our military discount asked about it she said next time as we were done with our purchase another woman came in got a Soda went to the machine got ice,  came out of the soda Machine no problem I asked her about it she said we thought it was broke was not happy with this at all asked to speak with somebody No response"}
{"text":"Ta-ta-ta-tastyyyyyyy!!! If you want a stellar, tasty, affordable lunch to nurse that 'party-too-hard-the-night-before' feeling...you MUST try Capriotti's.  

The spot is clean and staff is super friendly, though it's a little off the beaten path it's worth it! I highly recommend the 'Bobbie' &/or the 'SlawBeJoe'"}
{"text":"The steak and cheese here is as good as it gets in Madison.  Better than Big Red's.  Try any of the turkey sandwiches too.  You can have Thanksgiving year round!"}
{"text":"These guys are awesome, if you've never been they're all great but I've definitely had the best experience tonight. I recommended this place to a client of mine and they needed to feed 40 people last minute and late at night. After being turned away from two other locations Artie made it happen and I know my clients will love their food as much as I do! Thank you guys!!!"}
{"text":"First timer with a hankering for a hot roast beef or cheese steak,  disappointed that the delicious looking roast beef was cold only, but ended up with a hot provolone cheese steak sub, really loved it! Made to order, they really sweated the details to present a very fine sub. A first timer no more, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Today we came to Capriotti's at 9pm for sandwiches. When we arrived there was a line and only one guy taking orders and no one making sandwiches. The guy working called to the back that he needs help in the front, but no one came. He then went back there not once but twice to find the other employees. When we ordered the girl who had since appeared from the back asked if our order was for here or to go. We responded \"for here\". I ordered a capture 2, Capastrami sandwich and tomato bisque soup, my husband the Bobbie, medium. When our order was ready the guy had packed the sandwiches up into a bag and the soup was in a little take out container. I asked for a soup bowl as we were intending to eat it here and even though I know this isn't gourmet food I don't need to be eating my soup out of a paper cup. Well apparently they were out of real bowls. My guess is someone in the back wasn't doing their job. Possibly the same 2 employees cussing loud enough for us to hear while sitting next to the door. Either way, when I unwrapped my sandwich it was this pathetic little thing. I have ordered the capture 2 before and the sandwich I got was never this small. That's not what I paid 8.99 for, which prices went up as well. I am now done eating my meal and still hungry. I barely weigh 105lb and should not have to go home and make myself more food right now. I'd like my money back and hope they hire more professional employees who do their job and cuss less."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp!  Without your reviews we would never have found this place.   

My wife and I were recently in Vegas and visiting the Pinball Hall of Fame.   After a little while of playing we realized we were hungry and needed to eat.   We knew that later in the evening we would be having a big meal, so we thought a sandwich would be good.   We remembered that Capriotti's had received good reviews so we figured, what the heck.   Fellow Yelpers, you didn't let us down.   

It took a few minutes to find this place since it is tucked in the corner of a shopping mall, but it's worth the time to find it.   When we got in, we were greeted by a super friendly staff.   We decided to split a large sandwich.   After placing our order, the staff started to prepare it right away.   In a few minutes we picked up our sandwich and started to eat.   WOW!   It was good.  They don't skimp on the meat or cheese   I believe we had an Italian Sub.   The bread was this awesome soft roll.   Man, it was good.   The sandwich and a couple of drinks was something like $10.   That was a heck of a bargain especially when you consider the taste, quality and quantity of food we received.   

Will we be back?  You bet we will.   It's only 5 minutes from the Pinball Hall of Fame and it's a great place to eat!   Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Just like In & Out Burger,  \"keep it simple and they will come\".

I though my sandwich was small but I could barely finish it, it was dense with meat.  I got the Cheese Steak and I must say it's close to one of the best I've had.  Next time I will get the Bobbie, look up the website and the menu.

I can't wait to go back......"}
{"text":"The subs here are really, really good.

But they close SO early. They lose a ton of points for closing so early in a college town."}
{"text":"My bf makes a big deal about this place. According to him its the best sub shop. I didn't like it much. It wasn't the best or the worst. I'll eat here again if I am super hungry."}
{"text":"Customer service by the order taker, man in 20's with christa tattoo on his arm, lacked tremendously.  We weren't greeted or welcomed in any way. He seemed frustrated to have customers and told us it was going to be a 15 min. wait. No problem waiting. He never smiled at all and was having a problem operating the cash register. The brownie was old. The bobbie sandwich, made by the older guy, was good but he failed to change gloves after talking on the phone that was handed to him by the guy running the cash register. I wish I  had eaten at a different Caps but chose this one as I was staying at Green Valley Ranch. The previous reviews had some good and some bad. I guess I got the bad."}
{"text":"I am a huge Caps fan and I normally don't frequent this location a lot, normally we'll only stop here to get a bite before a movie, which we did last Friday night. I was quite impressed and felt compelled to share my good experience.

Here's the rap sheet for this location:

Pros:
1.) Great customer service. There were 4 dudes working and they all had a grin on their face.
2.) This location gives you a free, small bag of chips just for checking into Yelp. Score!
3.) Service was fast & efficient, our sandwiches were made correctly...the turnaround time is swift.
4.) This location serves french fries AND breakfast. This made me happy! Most locations do not serve either.
5.) Awesome location in GVR. Around lots of things...including the pool, the theaters, and The District. Plus, this location is open late which is perfect for late night drunken munchies ;) You can order anything from there to-go.
6.) I got a coupon on my receipt for $3 off my next Capriotti's purchase just by completing an easy peasy phone survey. 
7.) Instead of only offering Caps' generic bagged chips, this location also has name brand chips as well (Doritos, Lays, etc.)
8.) Clean!

Cons:
1.) Found a turkey bone in our sandwich. I just told management to be a little more careful. Luckily we didn't bite down on it hard.
2.) The smoke flows in to the seating area of the food court as there are slot machines located nearby.

You can clearly see the pros outweigh the cons. We'll definitely be back again and again. Who can resist their Bobbie? YUM!"}
{"text":"Oh Capriotti's....you & I have a secret love affair and no one knows how much I truly see you!!

When I'm at work, this is my Caps location that I visit the most. It's close, convenient and even better, when I'm too busy (or lazy) to drive to pick up my sammy, they'll deliver it to me for $3.00. Perfecto! Just remember if you want your sub delivered by noon, call in no later than 10am. They are in high demand y'all. The crew here is sweet but they know how to get down to business. 

Caps has hot sandwiches, cold sandwiches, salads, kids meals and more. My favorite is their good 'ol homemade turkey with mayo and provolone. Their bread is always fresh & soft and their turkey is actually fresh turkey....hand pulled. Say whaaaaaat? Yea, it not processed crap or little circles of pressed meat. This is real, straight up turkey. Beats Subway and Port of Subs ANY day of the week. Their hot, Philly cheese steak is delectable with all that yummy melty cheese and peppers slathered about. MMM! Is your mouth watering yet?

Oh and the Bobbie? This is like a full Thanksgiving dinner explosion in your mouth - complete with turkey, cheese, mayo, stuffing and fresh cranberry sauce. Just like the sammies Mama made you with leftovers in the golden days.

Don't take my word, go try it for yourself. Like now...."}
{"text":"heard a lot of good things about this place unfortunately the closest to me is in las vegas. since i was in vegas i dropped by for a sandwich to go and decided on the capistrami. i thought it was a 8.5 out of 10. The bread was the best part of the sandwich. the pastrami was tasty but i've had better. that's not saying i wouldn't go here again because i absolutely will. good thing that i just found out there is one now in my city of torrance. i will be trying that one shortly...like as in tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Awesome sandwiches, fresh, and the staff was great. Place was clean and we enjoyed our food . Rielly the manager is the sweetest, and made sure we were pleased with our food."}
{"text":"This place is always slow. I called in an order at 12:48 because i was set to take my hour lunch at 1 so I thought it'd be fast and easy to order over the phone. When i was done ordering the girl told me it'd be done in 15 minutes. It is now 1:25 and i'm still waiting. No benefit to ordering over the phone whatsoever. This location seems extremely understaffed and sometimes highly incapable of handling their lunch rush. I love the sandwiches capriotiis has to offer but I will NOT be returning to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Nine inches is small? That's the sort of thing that makes me feel inadequate. 

I mean, must make other sandwich shops feel inadequate. How are any of these other joints supposed to compete when $7 will get you nine fantastic inches of OFFICIAL cheesesteak. $13 will get you 20 inches. That's a lot of sandwich.

And the Capastrami ain't bad either. I have to admit that I've had better pastrami, but I lived three blocks from Katz's for years, so I'm spoiled. However, I do love the flavor combination.

The bread, the steak, the smiles, and the value here all justify the enormous wall of awards Capriotti's absolutely deserves."}
{"text":"I ordered \"The Bobbie\" (Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo). by phone and then picked it up. Parking was impossible, but I finally found a space nearby. My sandwich was ready and there was no delay in picking it up and returning home to eat it. It was just a tad dry, but otherwise tasty. 

I'd like to go back to try the Italian next time."}
{"text":"Smells like farts, and the girl rolled her eyes when I asked for a bag.  There are other Capriottis, so I'll go to one of those next time."}
{"text":"best capriottis in the valley!!!!! have had a few if the subs but you can not beat the bobbie. its like a thanksgiving feast without having to deal with your crazy family. but this shop is on there A game, some of the shops i have been to cant seem to put the sandwich together so it will not fall apart when you eat it . 

dont be a cheap ass, Tip them. go there enough and do it and you might get expedited service during lunch."}
{"text":"I was with a bridal party and after we got our nails done next door we popped in to grab sandwiches and salads. The turkey sandwich with sliced bread is really good! Everything looked really tasty and fresh. The employees were super nice and very attentive. When I go back to Vegas and want a sandwich I'll likely go to this place."}
{"text":"Came here to try the thanksgiving sandwich, aka \"the bobbie\". It is fully loaded with cranberry sauce & stuffing but I just wish it came out warmer. Like real thanksgiving food. Or at least the stuffing? I guess you can request them to warm up your sandwich on the grill? Also tried the slaw-be-joe but was not amazed. Stick with the bobbie!"}
{"text":"Have to agree with all the negative reviews of this location. Service has been consistently slow and poorly executed. I go when I am desperate for something other than subway fully expecting to leave there pissed off.  Are drugs an issue with these slack-jawed employees that cannot take a simple order?"}
{"text":"I was excited to try an Italian sub and was very disappointed by how dry it was. The amount of meat on the sandwich was just right but it definitely needed more veggies and oil/vinegar. For the price, I left feeling disappointed. I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, their sandwiches are just awesome. There are so many sandwich places out there and they are the same. This one stands out on its own and its worth the drive just to at least try it out.

keep doing what your doing guys its great food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was craving a philly cheesesteak sandwich and we searched through many options.  This place had a lot of great reviews from tourists and locals. This place went above and beyond our expectations! The philly cheesesteak sandwich was delicious with the cheese thoroughly mixed throughout the meat unlike other places that just throw cheese on top.  We also got the Capistrami which was devine! This will definitely become our regular spot."}
{"text":"I tried the Bobbie sandwich here for lunch.  It is a great option if you're in a thanksgiving food kind of mood.  The stuffing and cranberry sauce was very good, and the turkey was pulled not cold cut.  Great sandwich to have once in a while.  The mayo was a nice touch on top.  The pastrami sandwich looks good too, will try that next time."}
{"text":"So far I have been underwhelmed by my two experiences here.  I found the employees to be friendly, and the food tasted fairly good.  But there was just no pizzazz to it, and in each case it took about 20 minutes to receive my freshly prepared order.  

On my latest outing I ordered a 12\" Cheese Steak with Mushrooms, Sweet Peppers, and Fried Onions.  The grinder was cheesy and filling, but contained well done pieces of beef and was not that satisfying.  A generous amount of ketchup was provided on request as a dip, which perked up the taste of the sandwich somewhat.  Only potato chips are available here, although in each case I would have definitely preferred French Fries to go with my sub.  Upon checking into Yelp, I received a free large fountain drink of my choice.  I opted for Dr. Pepper, and appreciated the gesture."}
{"text":"Nice sandwich shop with a bit of an East Coast Italian feel.  Cheesesteaks, meatball sandwiches, cole slaw on sandwiches, and a seeming bent for turkey as well.  Nice veggie options as well.  Overall, not the broadest menu selection I've seen but the food is good and it's convenient if you're at the Red Rock and don't want to deal with the big lines at the buffet or Grand Cafe."}
{"text":"Getting the Bobbie for lunch was the best decision I made all day. The bread was fresh, I asked for extra mayo and they did just that! Of course my turkey and cranberry sauce was on point! Just delicious and I checked in to get my free soda pop! It hit the spot as always!"}
{"text":"This is the location closest to my house. Never had any issues. Service is always quick and friendly and in my opinion one of the best cheesesteak you will find in town. Haven't tried the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Not nearly the decadent Philly cheese steak sandwich the other Capriottis provide.  How about a little meat with that bread? I was expecting the usual generous portion of meat, cheese. It was skimpy.  I always add mushrooms and onion added only here they were frugal on the add ons. I paid extra for them and got a pathetic portion of everything.  For a small sandwich and small drink totaling almost $11.00, I expected a bit more of a lunch. I base my expectations off my many other visits at several other Capriottis locations. It tasted ok. Service was good."}
{"text":"Picked up some sandwiches and the staff were very friendly. Surprisingly the gentleman who gave me my order thanked me by name!! Amazing service! I definitely recommend this location. We will return soon!"}
{"text":"This place is very inconsistent. Ordered here a couple times before and the sandwiches were good, but this time it was terrible.  I always order the same thing so I know that they've made it better before. Bread was dry. Barely any cheese, steak and peppers. I've had subway that's been better. Paid 20 bucks for meh."}
{"text":"DISGUSTING!! employees and unsanitary habits!! Several workers were not changing gloves in between touching the register, cash, and handing customers sandwiches. I confronted one of the employees and asked if she had changed her gloves before beginning to make my sandwich, she said yes, after I had just seen her touch the counter, the register and accepting cash from a customer. I told her that I had seen her touch all of these things and not change her gloves and that she needed to, she did and I asked to speak to her manager. She said the manager was not there so I asked for the managers phone number, conveniently she doesn't know it. I will be calling the health department and the manager of this location. So disappointed and disgusted!!!"}
{"text":"The Bobbie sandwich is the best. Hands down the best reminder why Thanksgiving food is my favorite and if I ever need a hankering for Thanksgiving during December through October I know where to go. Oh and the sandwiches do keep. We bought ours and didn't eat it until Barstow. It was magical even two hours down the road."}
{"text":"\"I did it all for the Bobbie\" 

Yes folk's \"Bobbie\" sub is their nationally acclaimed best seller. 
Real turkey (not the processed junk) cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo seal the deal. 

Thanksgiving dinner on a roll, come on seriously...does it get any better? 

I am just a fan of turkey period, turkey and bacon, turkey and cheese, turkey and avocado, you name it I like it. The \"Bobbie\" sub is my ultimate favorite way of eating my turkey in form of a sub by far. 

I know most of us las vegas locals are aware of this sub, if you are a visitor or new to Capriotti's then give this sub a shot! 

*Honorable mention is the \"Capistrami\" sub, hot pastrami, swiss cheese, russian dressing and coleslaw. Mmmm yummy as well."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to this Capriotti's location at 9210 S Eastern Ave. Suite 115, Las Vegas NV 89123,

 I always go to the one at 9620 S. Las Vegas Blvd Suite E5, Las Vegas NV 89123.

 I placed the order over the phone. One Large Italian with extra onions, hot and sweet peppers on the side.

 I don't think they put extra onions on the sandwich, and the amount of hot and sweet peppers on the side was barely enough for half the sandwich.

They did not have a Military discount like the other store
.
Everything about the sandwich seemed fresh and tasted great, but I will be staying with the store at  9620 S. Las Vegas Blvd Suite E5, Las Vegas NV 89123."}
{"text":"They must of taken the last review to heart. It's the exact opposite all 3 times I've been here. I was even \"that guy\" who showed up 5 minutes before close. Had 7 people on staff working. Never waited here more than 5 minutes so far and everyone has been friendly."}
{"text":"An office favorite.  One of the many locations in the Las Vegas Valley, but this one is more memorable to me than the others I've visited.  More on that later.

Capriotti's is a sandwich shop whose slogan is \"Quality is our only gimmick\"  and they have proven that to us with every visit.   We have yet to get one bad sandwich out of the bunch, and we have ben getting lunch here at least once a week for the past two years that I have been working for my company.   

Some of our favorite sandwiches include
The Bobbie - aka Thanksgiving dinner on a roll.  Shredded turkey, Cranbery sauce and Stuffing and Mayo wrapped in the bread of your choice.
Capastrami - Hot Pastrami, Cole Slaw, Russian Dressing and Swiss
Mushroom Cheese Steaks
Sweet Italian Sausage with Sweet Peppers
And what we lovingly refer to as the \"Joe Pesci\" which is a Small Italian with extra peppers.

These are not your average skimpy subs, the small rolls are 9\" and the large are 20\" and they are fit  to bursting with all the goodies. So make sure to bring your appetite!

But my favorite reason to go to this specific location is, depending on how much of a tip you leave them, they show their gratitude by yelling out either: \" BEER MONEY!  or BIG BEER MONEY!!\"  Either reaction is cool, but it's always fun to hear \"BIG BEER MONEY!\"  I won't tell you at what amount beer money becomes BIG beer money, that's up to you and your generosity to find out."}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  I ordered the 9\" Bobbie.  It was amazing.....like Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  The sandwich came wrapped in butcher paper and it was huge.  It is about $6.50 but I literally got 2 meals out of it.  

The wait was kind of long but that was only because so many people were there.....always a good sign.  It is definitely worth the wait!  

I walked from the LV Hilton which did take a while and the walk is kind of boring since it is a couple of blocks off the strip but it was a beautiful day out, so why not?  

This place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Interesting!  That's how I would explain Capriotti's.  I ordered the Capistrami which I was quite excited about however I was very surprised when it didn't have mustard and it did have sweet coleslaw caked in mayo.  The pastrami was quite tasty and I would order it again if they allow me to have mustard and no coleslaw.  My kids enjoyed the grilled cheese sandwiches and my husband liked his cheese steak sandwich.  Tip the staff for a funny experience!"}
{"text":"The last time I went to Vegas was the first time I had Capriotti's. We had to go twice that weekend because it was so delicious. It's few and far between when you find a sandwich place that offers imitation meat for us vegetarian folk. 

The vegetarian philly cheesesteak sub is my favorite. The flavors are magical and the imitation meat they use is superb. The turkey sub is also very delicious, tastes a lot like a real turkey sandwich, comes with delicious veggies and served on a kaiser roll!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's is a stand-out sandwich shop -- I try to get there at least once a week.  

My favorites are the Capistrami and the Cole Turkey.  The ingredients are always fresh and the sandwiches are consistently made (you can always ask for less mayo, russian dressing and/or coleslaw on the sandwich, if you wish).  While it may be a little pricier than some other sandwich places, it is well worth it (as they say, you get what you pay for).

The staff is always friendly (and typically remember regular patrons) and flat screen televisions are throughout the establishment.    

As an iced tea drinker, I appreciate the fact that China Mist teas are available at Everything Bagels (which literally is attached to Capriotti's and is a fine bagel shop in its own right).

Finally, you definitely should sign up for Capriotti's text message deals -- they are sent out quite often and offer good deals."}
{"text":"One for their loyalty program.  Tried to enter app at  the store and said it was down . Tried again the next day and now says the receipt is to old. Won't accept my two sandwiches.  Kinda getting discourage with these programs that say when you can use them, how you cam use them and what minutes of the day while wearing a tutu you can redeem them .Have had no problems using Farmer Boys."}
{"text":"I remember Capriotti's many years ago and they were the best.........................must have new owners or new HR that hires.

I waited for ten minutes in the store all alone while the only guy working was in the bathroom.  Good thing i'm not a thief or i could have filled my pockets and car.  (finally the 2nd guy came around, he was out for a smoke break)
sandwich was weak at best.
very little meat ((( had the hot sausage sandwich) cheese was less than half slice, just was not a good experience like i remembered so many years ago when i lived in Phx and frequented these places a lot.
Maybe a bad day, but it certainly was"}
{"text":"Nothing like Capriotti's in other cities.  They don't have the same menu offerings as east coast locations, and even though I ate here when not busy it took a very long time for the food to arrive.  Parking is frustrating too because of the adjacent Starbucks patrons occupying so many spots.  Very poor chips selection as well - only two choices.  Really? 2 chips?"}
{"text":"I love the 3 sandwich size options here, and the eggplant sandwich was quite tasty.  Vegetarian options are always a plus for our large group of people, so everyone had something they liked in our large order.  This place has just the right vibe for a good sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Outstanding sandwich of the highest quality.    My son got the meatball sub and it was off the charts good.  I got the homemade turkey & it was great.  Very nice sandy shop!"}
{"text":"Ate so much, I was in pain for a good part of the day.  I wanted the Bobbie, and my husband, with good intentions, wanted to order the 12\" (better value and whatnot).  At first bite, I was thinking, \"Ooooo, this is YUMMY!  So glad I have another 11\".  By the quarter mark, I was still going strong.  At the halfway point, I was already struggling, but being raised by a strict mom, I was not going to waste any part of this delicious sandwich (on account of children in Africa starving daily).  So I soldiered on.  By the time I finished, I was in all sorts of pain and throwing serious shade at my husband.  
Bottom line, do get the Bobbie.  Order up, but make sure you have access to a fridge if you can't handle it, since there is mayo.  This has now replaced Earl of Sandwich as my new fave sandwich spot in LAS."}
{"text":"Went to grab a sub today and there was a sign on the door indicating that they \"regrettably\" closed up shop for good. Kind of a bummer."}
{"text":"Ordered online ... said my order would be ready at 9:30 ... came up to the cash register to pick up my order and guess what?  Didn't even bother to look at the online orders ... thanks Caps!!  Your the best ...!!! Third time this has happened ..."}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas, I popped in here for a sandwich. There were several options-- I went with a good ol' cheesesteak. It was a decent cheesesteak, and it was large enough to sate my lunch hunger with some left over for a later snack. I remember the service was especially friendly. Wish I had tried the grilled Italian, but maybe next time!"}
{"text":"This location late night is terrible. This is the 3rd time they have messed up my order. The time before tonight I got all the way home and they gave me a cheesesteak with just meat and bread even after messing it up the first time and asking how my sandwich was suppose to be. I ordered a home style turkey with no tomato or mustard, the cashier repeated my order took it step by step, then was the same person that made my sandwich and put tomato on it. It was always soggy by the time I got home. There's a difference between mis reading something or looking over it and just not listening. This location needs to listen more ."}
{"text":"not to be missed in LV - especially if you're looking to save a couple of bucks on at least one meal. phenomenal value (20 inch sub for about $13), and GREAT food. since i clearly can't finish a 20 inch sub, i actually saved some of it to eat the next day and it was still good!

got the philly, sister got the hot pastrami - both were tasty but i'm partial to the philly.

note - it is a little bit far away from the strip so you'll need a car to get here. worth it though!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best sandwich shop in town. Their signature sandwiches such as the Bobbie and Capastrami are second to none. If your ever in the mood for a sandwich, skip Subway and Quizno's and head to your local Capriotti's Sandwich shop!

**NOTE**

-Make sure to tip these guys out as they are all very appreciative for the beer money. :)"}
{"text":"We have looked all over Las Vegas for a great sandwich shop, and finally found it.  We can't believe it was right around the corner from us, great service, always as quick as possible and very well done.  All around good people, good value, and great sandwiches, a definite recommendation."}
{"text":"Food is great but whoever runs this place needs a swift kick to the head! Located in the heart of campus yet they close at 8pm leaving Qudoba next door to get all
The business from hungry students after8pm! Called at 7:45 was out on hold for 5 minutes and then told I could only order a sandwich if I could get there in 2 minutes because they closed at 8pm! When I said it was only 7:50 they said \"well our click says 7:58! \" ass hats!"}
{"text":"Love the food, hate the service. The sandwiches are so delicious, but I walked next door to the Chinese place and ordered food and received it, then came back to Capriotti's and my sandwich still wasn't done. The workers seemed to just be hanging out and talking, and the dining area was a mess. The entire look of the place was really dingy, I wouldn't eat in there. Better for takeout. I wish they delivered."}
{"text":"If you want a very filling and enjoyable sandwich for a great price, try out Capriottis.  The first sandwich I ever tried was a Bobby, which is Thanksgiving in a sandwich.  It was very tasty and filling that I was full after half a sandwich.  You get a mix of turkey, gravy, stuffing, and more goodies.  There are other great hot sandwiches available as well."}
{"text":"Philly cheese steak sooo bomb !!!! Got a foot long ate half and I'm so full but I can't stop eating !!!"}
{"text":"Extremely unprofessional staff. Filthy restaurant. Went there a couple months ago at 7:50 on a Friday evening (I guess they close at 8). Stood there for about 2 minutes and finally realized that the kids behind the counter had no intentions of acknowledging us.  They could have even said hey we are closing in ten minutes and have cleaned up our areas we are sorry.  Nope! That's what happens when you hire kids and don't train them to interact with customers."}
{"text":"I had a Capastrami sandwich today. It was really really  tasty. One thing that I hated about the place is that its not comfortable for eating there. The thing with Jasons Deli is that the place itself is really cool and one can go with friends or family. Not with Capriottis.  Athough the food is superb, you have to take it home."}
{"text":"Wow, I've been to Capriottis dozens of times, but his was my first time at this location. Horrible. Wasted an hour of my time having to drive back to the restaurant after getting home and finding out they didn't get ANY of my order correct. I would avoid this location for sure and Capriottis in general if this is how they do business now."}
{"text":"Not off to a good start when the male cashier neglected to greet me or really acknowledge my presence. No one else was in line. I get that working in a food court may not be the most stimulating of professions, but Cap's has a good reputation, and if you're gonna work in a food court, GVR is not the worst.
Maybe all the gray hairs made him cranky. 
I don't need a hearty, hello, welcome to Cap's, but something more than silence isn't too much to ask.
I had a $5 off coupon (written on the manager's business card cause they were out of the $5 coupons when I bought a gift card) near Christmas. Of course I had trouble using the $5 off, apparently the female employee who gave it to me isn't there now. I told them to phone a supervisor but no one did. I got the $5 off but it was a hassle. 
The Bobbie I had was good, but the meh experience here turned me off from Cap's."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich. I ordered the Italian. It was wonderful. Will definitely go back here for more."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Capriotti's for over 10 years and I think it is no longer as good as it once was. We've had it a few times over the past year and come to this same conclusion. :(

Maybe it's just the franchises or how the business changed. I recently spent over $25 on two sandwiches, a Capistrami which was really meh but I actually now have the desire to try to recreate this sandwich on my own. 

We also had a cheesesteak and that was so bad that I decided to post a review. It was probabaly the worst cheesesteak that I've ever had that I can remember, strangely it was really spicy from pepper, not sweet or hot peppers but black pepper since I ordered no peppers. 

Sad to say after all these years, I am no longer a fan of Capriotti's and will search for a new sandwich place."}
{"text":"I live across the street and was so happy when this opened. First couple weeks, food was good, service was great. Now, my bread was old, stale and ends were completely hard (Cole Turkey). I ordered xtra Russian dressing, even says so on my receipt and not a drop in my sandwich. Cashier Demetrius has a lot of attitude and acts like the guest is interrupting his day to take an order. Only good thing is the older lady who gave me my food when it was up. She is always nice and friendly. Never have seen a manager yet, you would think being a new store in Aliante they would be out talking to guests and thanking them for being there. I did call and complain and was told they are under new management and working on things. How about you work on fresh bread and correct orders at 130pm in the afternoon! I am done with this location. They did offer to mail me coupons, but I refused as I will not be back."}
{"text":"Damn delicious sandwiches! I drove the 20 or so minutes out for a sandwich for myself and my two sons. We'd never had Capriotties and were excited. I get there only to realize that I forgot my wallet. Thinking quick, I decided to order online (from the parking lot, lol), and called my son for he card #. After I ordered I went inside to wait, expecting it to be a while. Within 15 minutes all of our sandwiches were ready. I drove all the way home and we dug in. Exceptional! My oldest son had the capastrami and said \"dang mom, THIS is what pastrami should taste like. I don't think I've ever had a better one. I mean WOW.\" My picky 8 year old said his  turkey with cheese was \"Amazing and good.\" My cheese steak was SO good. Tender and tasty, and the bread is perfect. We will definitely be back- and soon."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite place to get a philly is Caps! Breanna was very helpful and polite in taking my phone order and using my survey coupon. Great food and good service, food was ready within ten minutes of calling."}
{"text":"I hadn't had Capriottis in forever and called in my order. Location is bad small overcrowded plaza with psycho inpatient people driving, it was an in act of congress to find a parking spot. After I picked up my order and tried my sandwich I was somewhat disappointed. The pastrami wasn't bad it lacked a lot of flavor, skimpy on the Russian dressing. I don't know this particular spot just didn't get it right at all"}
{"text":"Small Homemade Turkey Sandwich - ****
Large Philly Cheese Steak Sandwich - ****

I'm glad this sandwich shop is super close to the UNLV library. Came by one night because I was hungry and wanted something close by before I went to go study at the library. It was my first time here and it was pretty busy with people inside. The gentleman behind the counter was really sweet and helpful with taking my order... I had no idea what to get but he pretty much explained their menu and what their most popular items were. I'm basic so I got the homemade turkey sandwich and a cup of tomato bisque soup. My friends got the philly cheesesteak. It didn't take too long, but I was just shocked at how big the sandwich sizes were. I had leftovers from my sandwich, and I believe the large was 20 inches! Like holy cow!! Overall, I enjoyed my meal and experience at this stop. Thanks for being friendly!!!"}
{"text":"What happened to this place? I was craving a Capistrami so stopped at this Capriottis, what a disappointment. When I walked in there was a couple waiting to order. There were 4 employees in the back and no one up front.

As the lady was coming up to take their order the phone rang and she answered it, taking a large to go order while we stood there waiting. After taking our orders there was still no one making the sandwiches, they were all in the back still.

After I finally got my order I unwrapped the sandwich. It was mostly bread (which didn't seem very fresh) and not much pastrami or toppings. Definitely not the Capriottis I remember. Maybe it was just this location but the food and service were really disappointing."}
{"text":"Great great great!!  Amazing sandwiches and service!  Small but sufficient shared parking lot, close to the strip (2 blocks-ish) without the craziness of the strip, and the service is fun and busy -- large staff to fully support the orders (not 1-2 people, but 8 or more!).

First, you have to know, the secret to a good sandwich is the bread.  Here, at Capriotti's, they know HOW TO DO IT RIGHT!

Randy's Top 4 Capriotti Sandwiches:

#1 \"The Bobbie\" - (to die for) - moist and tender shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, and STUFFING 

#2 Meatball - (thats'a Italian to you) - great and meaty balls, super good, great sauce

#3 Roast Beef - (so dang good!) - cooked right there in the shop, super moist and tender, and shredded

#4 Chicken cheesesteak - (The Pope would say \"holy moly\") - tender chicken cuts, get the works with cheese, mushrooms, peppers, and onions!

Capriotti's is my favorite sandwich shop!!  There are many locations, find one nearest you (or move closer to one!)"}
{"text":"capriotti's has the best sandwiches!  

my favorites are the bobbie and capastrami.  the bobbie is like thanksgiving dinner in a sandwich.  what's good about the capastrami? um, everything!  

i can't go without having capriotti's when i'm in vegas.  i frickin wish hawaii had at least one."}
{"text":"First and definitely last time visiting them.
Came here 20 min ago, did an average order without something fancy or special. Still waiting. I'm alright with waiting in case of notice before, not after. It's not crowdy, there's no line, they're just slow for some reason. 
Since I'm in rush that's just unacceptable.1"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! Talking to your guests like it is \"Always their fault\" is a very bad habit. We ordered food to be delivered to our business meeting and was promised a certain time. (We use this location for most of our business lunches so they know us and our needs)  Almost 1 hour and 30 minutes past that time promised and still no food. When I called the manager he said \"Sorry, Do you want me to cancel your order now?\" So as our meeting ended and the people were leaving our workplace the food shows up! We will never again use your business. Being kind and accurate with your information goes a long way folks! You shouldn't over promise and not be able to deliver."}
{"text":"i ordered the bobbie..(boss).. the staff was nice enough but the place itself was FREEZING.. uncomfortably chilly which makes it almost impossible to sit & enjoy your food.. also, no paper towel in restrooms (gross).. 3 stars for sevice & food.. wont return to this specific location again :/"}
{"text":"Eh. Nice employees but the sandwich was nothing special. Had the cole turkey. Wish it would have been sliced deli turkey instead of chunks of turkey. I had a little trouble finding the place because the sign is very small. Can't say that I'll be back since there are so many other options for subs."}
{"text":"This shop in particular is just not good. The employees always seem miserable as hell and can never seem to get a simple turkey sandwich right. Great sandwiches when they're made correctly, but I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"This review is solely for this specific location. Walked in hungry for a delicious sandwich. Lady behind the counter greeted me, and then proceeded to cough all over into the open air. Seemed to be a smoker's cough cause it continued for the entire 3 minutes I was there (just long enough to realize that a capriotti's sandwich didn't sound as good as I thought)."}
{"text":"The capastrami might just be the most satisfying sub I've ever tasted.  As amazing as the sandwich is on its own, do yourself a favor and get it with the sweet and hot peppers, which they'll do for free.  The flavors are incredible.  I generally split a large with my gf, for the best value.  Price is $13.95 for a large, while other larges are about a dollar cheaper.  This Capriottis gets a special bonus because a) they have a fountain machine and b) they apparently deliver to hotels on the strip.  I will definitely take advantage of b next time I'm in Vegas.  Instead I had my cab drop me there before heading back to the airport.  Yeah, it's definitely that good."}
{"text":"This is the most convenient Capriotti's sub shop! They are open late and it's always super clean.

Being inside the Green Valley Ranch also gives you the ability to go enjoy the District or gambling so it's a win win for me! 

The employees are always really nice and upbeat unlike other chain restaurants."}
{"text":"If you want an east coast style sub this is the place to go! Being originally from PA I love a great Philly Cheese Steak sub and finding a good authentic one is tough to do out here! 

Yes this place isn't Pat's or Geno's of Philadelphia but the sandwiches are pretty darn good! They also carry Wise potato chips another East coast staple! I just wish they still had Tastykakes and my whole PA experience would be complete!"}
{"text":"If I went back in times and gave the Pilgrims a Capriotti's signature sandwich, would they swoon or shoot me for such a witchery goodness? I guess we'll never know.  If you were like me and never had it before, its basically your Thanksgiving meal on a sub roll.  [Turkey + Cranberry Dressing + Stuffing]

As crazy as this sounds it came to fruition.  My first bite into it, I was like, \"whoa, this is interesting.\"  I was definitely skeptical about it, but the ingredients complimented each other nicely.  As I delve more, I appreciated it more and fully enjoyed it.  I expected it to be a hot sandwich but it was served cold, so I wonder if I can get it warm the next time?

If you are noob and order like a medium you will be overwhelmed, stick to the small as its the equivalent of a foot long.  Trust me.  I'm not sure if I would come here for anything else but if I ever do have a crazy craving for a Thanksgiving sandwich then I will be sure to pop into a Capriotti's."}
{"text":"#1 in Vegas for a reason.  Everyone has their favs.... the capistrami, the cheeseteak with mush...  Mine is definitely the Bobby.  In case you haven't viewed their menu yet, the bobby is thanksgiving leftovers in a huge sandwich... yeah, exactly."}
{"text":"I love the Italian sub and the Bobbi's at Capriotti's. The sandwiches are huge and the meat is delicious! I always have the other half for lunch the next day. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Capriotti's location I've ever been to. I mean, the food has never been THAT good. I remember when I'd get the Bobbie at other locations, it was always great. But even though the food here at this location wasn't great, it was still decent at times. I live close so the convenience factor really mattered. But not only is the food here no good, but the service is TERRIBLE. I've tried ordering delivery or pick-up MULTIPLE times and had no answer on the phone. I'm guessing it's just kids that don't want to work, but this location sucks. Hire some people that want to work and make the food decent. Until they do this, avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"So I've seen the \"opening soon\" sign for some weeks now and was excited for a new sandwich place in the neighborhood. After kicking my own booty at the gym I was starved and craving meat. I decided to negate my work out efforts and give Capriottis a try. 

I was really conflicted on whether I should go for the meatball or the Philly cheese steak. Cheese steak won. Small size with mushrooms and onions. And a small drink. Just under $11. I had to gasp for air as I felt like someone just punched me in the gut and mugged me. This better be way YUM! 

When the sandwich came out I calmed down a little about the price. The small is 9\" (giving all other small subs out there major feelings of inadequacy) and turned into two meals for me. It reheated very well the next day, I might add. 

The sandwich was tasty. Nothing to write home about. I really like their bread. It's funny, the other guy complained not enough meat and I would really liked to have seen more mushrooms and onions in my sub. The onions are diced and very small so I had a difficult time detecting their flavor, same goes for the mushrooms. 

I was disappointed when they told me they didn't have malt vinegar. I love dipping my cheese steaks in that stuff. The guy suggested red wine vinegar and I was so desperate I tried it. It was pretty good. Still can't beat malt though. Hopefully they will get enough requests for it and add it to their inventory. 

It is obvious they just opened and are working out some kinks here and there. Totally understandable and nothing to give them a hard time about. I will be back for more. 

Oh! And they deliver! Since we don't have a JJ in delivery range I am thrilled about that fact. :)"}
{"text":"My girlfriend has been craving a mushroom steak and cheese sub for the past couple of weeks, and while that's easy to find in New England where we're both from, it's not so easy to find in the Phoenix area.

But, now we know where to look.

Great sandwiches and a great looking menu that we'll be exploring for quite a while. And they also stock a variety of Wise potato chips products which aren't widely available here.

For a taste of home, we know where to go, and we'll be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time here but I was very pleasantly surprised! The menu is simple but still had a ton of different choices, and the prices are great! The people are nice and the ordering process was simple and quick. They also have a lot of vegetarian options which is fantastic and rare for sandwich places! The subs and salads are so amazing and fresh. I am definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I think I may have died and gone to heaven.  In all seriousness...they make some crazy good sandwiches there.  I keep wanting to try other types, but I keep getting the Bobby and the hot pastrami which are both to die for.   The best part is if you get a big one...you can easily make two full meals out of it.  Thanks Capriotti's for some great food!"}
{"text":"I was driving around, looking for a place to eat lunch after a long hike, and was excited to see a sign for Capriotti's, claiming it was voted the \"best sandwiches in America\". I ordered an Italian Sausage (hot sandwich). I was a little confused when I unwrapped it and saw just sliced Italian sausage on a bun. That was it. I started wondering if I had missed a crucial part of the ordering process (was there a list of toppings I was supposed to choose from?). Who knows. The sandwich was OK, but didn't live up to my expectation of \"best sandwich in America\". Despite my disappointment, I will likely give them another chance. Service was friendly and the cookie was the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Capriottis sandwiches are incredible.  I've been there many times and still venture back to their hot pastrami.  It's just so good.  The prices aren't terrible considering you get a 9\" sub, a drink and a bag of chips for $10.50.  It's not subway for-gosh-sakes.  I love capriottis.  Their hot sandwiches are my go to.  pastrami."}
{"text":"We hadn't eaten in 6 hours, coming through the desert from Death Valley (California) to Las Vegas and were fairly hungry.  Came upon civilization and took our chances on Capriotti's.  It's a smallish place your order, take  seat and come up when we call your name place. 

No welcome, if fact she barely looked up.  He ordered the small (9\" cheese steak) and I ordered the black and bleu salad.  Being mostly gluten free for 10 months I try to stay that was, especially when I am traveling.  One of the ingredients in my salad was fried onions.... they were coated in flour and fried.  No problems, I just scooted them out of the dish.

It appears when a tip is added to the bill the girl at the register yells, \"Beer Money\".  Not appropriate, and I doubt she is legally old enough to drink it.

Let's just get down to business.  The place was trashed.  Trash on the floor, garbage can overflowing and I did not see one single table wiped down as we ate and other came and left.

That SMALL cheese steak was$8.49.  My salad, with \"home cooked roast beef\" 7.49.  His med. beverage a fair 1.79.  I had water.   $19.27 plus tip.  You have the facts, you get to choose."}
{"text":"I just had a slaw b joe..I was very disappointed  when you pay 10 bucks for a sandwich you don't expect that you'll have to chew around fat..sadly, I won't be going there again"}
{"text":"First and last time... I ordered a small cheesesteak chips and a drink it came out $11.80 the first thing I noticed was how unbelievably light the sandwich felt when they handed it to me however I was in a hurry on my lunch break and had to go... I open it up and there is only a pinch of meat and cheese no onions or peppers like the menu states.. it's not like they where busy I was the only customer at the time.. I feel like they stole my money..."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is in my good graces again!

Although the seating in this one is really limited, only \"bar\" style, they have consistently delivered a good culinary experience for my taste buds, over my two recent visits.

Got the usual Capastrami, with extra meat, and was made perfectly this time.

Kudos"}
{"text":"So, I have a secret, well, not so secret now, thing for a great sandwich. The capastrami fits the bill, and is quite delectable. It's somewhat similar to Tat's deli, in Seattle, not quite as much flavor but these guys have a better cut of meat, much better.

My preferred, and only, sandwich that have ordered, is the Capastrqmi, which I generally get the medium 12 inch with one extra packet of meat. Each packet, from what have been told, is 2.5 ounces. I also ask them to make it light on coleslaw. It adds something but don't like a lot. Wish the roll had more flavor, was a little crusty or something different, but will always be a fan of the Capastrami

This location is pretty standard and the people really do seem to care. Whenever am in someplace new, with a Capriotti's, I always go there. Lucky for me, Las Vegas is packed with them!"}
{"text":"I'm normally a huge fan of Capriotti's, but this time they had two strikes against them. I always get the Capastrami, with one package of extra meat. Made sure to highlight this today, however it was missing. A sub par experience.

The other thing was when got rung up, had to buy my drink and cookie on separate receipt. Anyone that knows about Capriotti's reward program knows that need a $5 minimum receipt order to count as a visit. I don't care about visit per se, just that dollar account is recorded. So had to buy extra just to get over the limit.

Overall the sandwich is good and service was good though for me it's hard to overcome those two things."}
{"text":"Mmmm, this sandwich place was the business, especially post-hangover, and my last meal before hitting the road.   I got their roast beef sandwich with all the fixings, and I must say that usually I'm not a coleslaw fan but it definitely was super good in this sandwich.

Service was also super polite and the lady at the counter was polite enough to give us some suggestions since it was our first time there.  Too bad they don't have any locations in N.Cal, I'll have to wait again to have another of these tasty concoctions!"}
{"text":"The short of it:
- inexpensive, fast service
- sandwich shop chain
- Favs: The Bobbie

The long of it:
I was skeptical about this place, just kind of seemed like an ordinary sandwich shop, nothing special. I went ahead and tried the bobbie which everyone raves about. It's pretty much a thanksgiving sub sandwich: turkey, cranberry, stuffing. Sounded good, but not amazing. After my first bite, I was in love. The turkey isn't just regular turkey breast, its a mix of pulled white and dark turkey meat and they put a good amount of mayo which pairs well with the delicious stuffing and cranberry sauce. YUM! I had to buy an extra sandwich for the road because it was that good!"}
{"text":"I love Cap's and have been going to them for years in California and Delaware. This one's food is consistent with the others. 

I've been to this specific location three times now - preordered each meal online. EVERY time I have arrived after the \"ready by\" time, and EVERY time they've not even started on my sandwiches or salads. 

Food (my passion for the capistrami and bobbie) is the only reason I'm giving three stars. Don't waste your time with preorders."}
{"text":"Had the turkey on wheat bread. Bread was great, where's the shredded turkey? I probably had 3 tablespoons total on my full sandwich. I'll stick with Jimmy Johns everyday of the week."}
{"text":"I'm not a regular at Capriotti's, but I was less than impressed with this particular location. It seemed a little on the grimy / dirty side and the guys working there seemed confused by the who pick up process for an order I placed online. 

The sandwich was overly salted when I got it home and I can't say I'd come back to this location."}
{"text":"I've only been to Capriotti's on a hand full of occasions, but I do enjoy them more than most chain sandwich places in town. The service has always been friendly when I stop by and although they are a little slow, the sandwiches always come out tasty. 

I'm not a fan of the infamous bobby, but I always end up with one of their hot sandwiches or turkey. I do wish they have more toppings to choose from like avocado, but for the most part, this place is a good spot for a quick food fix and the sandwich sizes are ridiculous."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorie sandwich places. I've only had it twice but I'm coming back for more! Make sure to try the Bobby. It's literally thanksgiving turkey dinner on a bun. Cranberry, pulled turkey and goodness."}
{"text":"Cannot beat the Bobbie sandwich, especially if you love Thanksgiving dinner. Turkey, cranberry sauce and love the stuffing!"}
{"text":"Capriotti's is a gem in a handful of rocks.  

When moving into my new house a few weeks ago, I needed to feed my \"helpers\" well.  They wanted sandwiches, they got sandwiches.  Two days in a row!

I eat sandwiches very rarely.  When I do, I want those carbs to count.

The first time I tried Capriotti's, I tried The Bobbie, which is their bestseller.  The Bobbie is a homemade shredded turkey sandwich with homemade stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayonnaise.  

The turkey was shredded and reminded me of day after Thanksgiving leftovers.  It was that delicious.  I skipped the mayo, but I still got a sopping wet sub sandwich.  Not that I am complaining, it just made it a little hard to eat all that deliciousness.  Next time I am craving a carb-heavy sammy, I may order The Bobbie again, this time sans the mayo and light on the cranberry sauce.

The second time I tried Capriotti's, I had the regular cheesesteak.  I forgot to order it with peppers and onions, so it was a little boring... but the flavor of the meat was spot on.  

My mom had the cheesesteak with mushrooms and found only three small bits of mushroom in the entire sandwich.  I don't know how that happened, but it was a bit of a disappointment.  When you want your fungi, you want your fungi!

All in all, this is a SOLID 4 star rating.  Capriotti's makes fresh sandwiches far better than any of the larger chains.  They take a little longer than your standard sub shop, but quality takes time.  Their prices are also quite a bit higher but, again, you're paying for quality."}
{"text":"Talk about fast friendly service!  I've never gotten cappriottis so fast.  Thanks guys!


So this particular location across from Csn used to not only be good but also fast....they are now neither of those. Could barely eat my sandwich and I've heard the same from others"}
{"text":"The Capastrami was excellent. I will be back to try other selections. If you haven't tried this place you should go there for lunch as soon as possible it was delicious."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of Capriotti's for many years now. I am from philly and it's the closest you will get out here. The last time we went 3 of us split a cheesesteak,cappastrami and a bobbi. They all taste real good but the bobbi had so little turkey on it and seemed to be filled with stuffing. If this was my first time here it would have to get 3 stars but cause of all my others years of great sandwichs i just hope that this was just a bad sandwich maker and will give them the benifit of the doubt."}
{"text":"I gotta say, amazing philly cheese steak. Bar none.
Didn't give 5 stars though due to the establishments weak customer service. Work on that."}
{"text":"Capriotti's is not your local subway. The Bonnie! Thanksgiving in a sub. Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing.. ohhhhh bad move to eat this during my hour lunch. :) Service was very friendly. The place is clean and well taken care of."}
{"text":"Sandwiches were delicious but my roast beef and Cole slaw was good but would have been out of this world if I could have had it toasted. Also this place is not for kids. They had NO high chair, only a booster seat and unstable chairs and their bathroom had NO changing table, I had to change my son in a hot car."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are standard Capriotti's - I usually get a Bobbie, cheese steak, or  regular tuna sandwich, plus a cookie (they write an expiration time on the back so you know how long they've been out!). Consistent and good. I always order my sandwich, pop over to take care of my dry cleaning, and come back. I never have to wait long. 

Docked a star for a couple of reasons:

1. Not really their fault, but this place is like the hotel california - you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave! It's a Henderson thing. You can't turn left anywhere! If you exit on Marks you have to turn right, but then the first opening is too narrow to reasonably make a u-turn, so you end up having to make a series of lefts instead. If you exit on Sunset, you have to cross like 4 lanes of people getting off the freeway to even get to Marks, which isn't always easy (and I am a crazy driver from LA!)

2. The vents are really loud and the counter is really high, so I can never hear what they are asking me. Also, since they can't see my mouth while I'm ordering it makes it harder for them to understand me, which means that both of us have to repeat ourselves a lot, which isn't fun."}
{"text":"I love this place! its small but its well maintained and the people who works here are very nice! I ordered the bobbie, and is a very high quality sub!  I always come here when Im craving for turkey!"}
{"text":"A place that puts turkey, cranberry sauce and dressing (stuffing for non-southerners) on a crusty bun deserves a 4 star or better rating.   Geesus people that's an insane sandwich.  

I had lunch here recently with Rand H, Mike C and Robyn B.  Met Jackie C for the1st time.   

For lunch,  I stuck with the \"more of the middle road\" and ordered the Capistrami... Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw.  But instead of having mine on a toasty bun, I had mine with a bit of lettuce in a bowl.  A fantastic bunless sandwich and since this particular sammie is quite the messy one, I'm happy I could eat this one with a fork.

For those who love sandwiches, their's come in 9, 12 and 15 in bun sizes.  Uhm yeah... BIG, HUGE and Gigantic.  

I'll definitely return to this place.  I may work up the courage to try the Bobbie, but until then, I'm fine with the Capistrami!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife and daughter, and none of us were impressed. The roast beef and pastrami sandwiches were overly dry, the syrup to soda ratio was off, and the employees were unattentive.

My wife had to ask for extra cups of mayo to make the sandwich edible, and of the three drinks I tried, I could barely tell a difference between them - they all tasted like carbonated water.

Definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Fantastic sub shop that gives you adequate amount of food for the price.  In our group we had the Bobbi, Patti, and the Meatball and it was all very good.  The people that were helping us were nice and I can't wait to head back here and try the other subs!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch after doing a walk-through at a home we ended up renting - my husband was desperate for a Steak Sandwich.  The guy at the counter recommended their Award-Winning \"Bobbie\" to me since it was my first time, I conceded.

We both really enjoyed our subs and my husband is very particular about his Steak Sandwiches!  Thanksgiving in June in a Sandwich was a nice treat for me (and I usually don't care for cranberry sauce).  I ordered a Small, but because it was so stuffed I had more than enough for the next day!  

Very excited that this nice little sandwich shop is so close to home."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time over the Thanksgiving weekend.  The menu is small but there is probably something for everyone.  I planned on getting the Bobbie since that is what everyone raves about but when I found out it was a cold sandwich that kinda turn me off.  I ended up with the cheesesteak sandwich.  The sandwich was pretty good.  Hubby had a tuna sandwich and he said it was just like a big subway sandwich (he likes subway but I'm not sure that was a compliment).  Drinks are bottles so no refills.  The service was fast and friendly.  This location had a terrible sewage oder in the dining room that was even stronger in the bathroom.  It made eating much less enjoyable than it should have been.  I would rate the food 4 stars but will remove a star for the horrible stench.  When I go back next time hopefully the smell will be gone and I can bump the star level up."}
{"text":"I have to this was a very good experience. Super friendly staff and the food was great I had the capastrami and the only issue was the  12\" is a filling sandwich.  The toppings where fresh and delicious the bread was great fresh and delicious. My wife had the 1/2 sandwich and salad enjoyed every bite and was also quite full
I recommend giving it a try"}
{"text":"I am a HUGE fan of Caps! This was just a horrible experience. Yesterday, I ordered from Yelp for Delivery. My Delivery took about 2 hours to get to me, the  Chicken CS was cold. I know that they're very busy, but not how I wanted my review to go."}
{"text":"Love the cheese steak....the cheese is the best part and the sandwiches are big and inexpensive"}
{"text":"Semi-Disappointed.  I went here after hearing so much about \"The Bobbie.\"  I got this legendary sandwich and it just wasn't so legendary.  
Stuffing, cranberry sauce, and turkey!? Thanksgiving in your mouth right?  ehhh..well the mayo was so overpowering and it was served cold.  Both kinda threw me off.  Of course I can't rank a place on one sandwich and will have to return for more.

I mean hey...they are probably the first shop that lists a 12 inch sub on the menu that is actually 12 inches! (huge!)"}
{"text":"I was disappointed this evening in my steak sandwich. The meat was dry and over cooked, I asked for mayo and it wasn't even spread over the bun. The Customer Service was very good, but the sandwich wasn't good at all."}
{"text":"This Capriotti's is right in my neighborhood so I frequent it when I don't want to drive too far.  I actually like the one on Trop and Fort Apache better, I'm not sure why, same sandwich right?  In any event, they always have great and quick service at this location.  The Bobby is still to die for and the place has plenty of seating. Now I'm hungry and I think I'll have to find a Capriotti's near me now."}
{"text":"I'm always searching for east coast style food. I found this sandwich shop in my searches and I must say it's as close to real easy coast subs I've found here. I've been to a few locations however prefer the strip as it's easiest for me to go to that one. Service is on point, little wait times even if they're busy. Sandwiches always made when ordered fresh. I recommend the famous Bobby or a Cheesesteak."}
{"text":"I've ordered a cheese steak with onions, mushrooms, hot peppers, adding eggs to it, over a dozen times at the GVR location.  Today, I was told that they couldn't do it.  I told him I've ordered this same thing many times, of course paying extra for the eggs.  He said, \"They're not supposed to.\"   I said, OK and left.  Love their sandwiches, but the guy at the counter today was just plain lazy."}
