{"text":"I'm a fan. A fresh selection of local and seasonal foods with a menu that changes very regularly.
Service was great, Robert our waiter was very accommodating, friendly, and fun.
The food was delicious, and I was lucky enough to get a grass-fed beef sirloin steak - quite rare to find."}
{"text":"Mioum!! La tartiflette, la cuisse de lapin, les huîtres tout était super bon!! Service sympatique et jovial"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here. We selected the 5-course dinner and loved it! The atmosphere is warm and inviting, and the food excellent and thoughtfully paired well with the wines."}
{"text":"Accueil chaleureux, nourriture délicieuse, service impeccable. C'était une belle découverte."}
{"text":"After so many positive reviews, I decided to try it, despite being quite a walk to get there from downtown. 
However, going there was definitely worth it. So far, it was one of the best meals I've had in Montreal. To start, the service was great, especially when compared to other restaurants in Montreal. Although it was a bit slow, I don't think it took away from the experience at all. 
Despite not having a menu in English, the server took his time to explain every single item on the menu, and all sounded good.
I decided to have the rabbit, which was stuffed with risotto and cheese. 
The sauce was outstanding, and even the vegetables on the side had great flavor. 
The rabbit itself was also good, but surprisingly, to me, the highlight was the stuffing.

Overall it did not disappoint. Perhaps it is possible to get similar quality foods for a bit less money in Montreal, due to the huge variety, but this won't disappoint. 
I ended up not having dessert, although from the sound of everything, I wish I had. 

Definitely consider visiting this place. Great for a date, business, or even family."}
{"text":"Amazing staff ... So sweet and translated everything word by word for us from the menu (were from Toronto) ... Food was amazing ...reasonably pric ed"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  Great service. Everybody in our party of 7 expressed their satisfaction. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I went there for Valentine's Day and definitely had a lovely experience! Although the restaurant is located in a sketchy place for fine french cuisine, the staff is super welcoming and available for advices. 

For french cuisine beginners, it's a bit hard to figure out what's on the menu because they use lots and lots of fancy ingredients that I can barely remember. But that makes the experience more fun if you want to try new things. 

Chez Chose is great for romantic dates and if you get the chance to have a dessert, I'd definitely recommend to try the Chocolate cream Jar with caramelized avelines and chantilly... it's like having a mouthful of ferrero chocolate, perfect match of not-too-sweet nutty taste."}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal I was recommended by a friend to go to Chez Chose and try trier unique french cuisine. The food tasted amazing and the service was great! I really liked the duck dish and the chocolate desert was amazing.

I will recommend this restaurant to anyone who visits Montreal."}
{"text":"Food was good but not great.  Over salted and portions out of balance for a tasting menu.  I wanted to really like this place but I won't be back, with all the phenomenal options in Montreal.  The service was really spotty, and our server basically told us what we wanted instead of having a conversation, which ended up with my friend ending up with a bottle of wine she didn't choose, and a charge for her to have the last glass paired with our meal (we both paid for the pairing), all because we told him she didn't like red wines."}
{"text":"Quelle bonne nouvelle quand j'ai su que chez chose demenageait sur Belanger. Avoir un restaurant gastronomique à moins de 10 minutes à pied de chez soi est un pur plaisir. Les plats sont savoureux. La cave bien choisie. Que demander de plus!"}
{"text":"Le meilleur resto de cuisine française que j'aie essayé jusqu'à date. Toute la nourriture vient du Québec, est apprêtée avec soin. Le serveur connaît visiblement tout son menu, nous l'explique avec passion dans les moindres détails et avec le sourire s'il-vous-plaît! 
Nous avons pris le foie gras en entrée. Excellent. 
J'ai pris le lapin fourré aux cèpes avec une sauce divine, vraiment à recommander. Le lapin était à point, bien assaisonné, du délice du début à la fin. 
Mon amie a pris l'assiette d'agneau, qui selon ses dires était tout aussi bon.
Le vin était délicieux, 
En dessert une version québécoise des \"chourros\", moins impressionnante que le reste du menu mais tout de même très bon.
Seul hic, le prix. Entrée partagée, plat principal, dessert, un verre de vin chaque et thé, 140$ pour 2.
Mais parfois il faut savoir se gâter. :) J'y retournerai!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had in months, and very reasonably priced.

Starting off, I ordered the salad of the day.  It was a beet salad, and I hate beets.  But this was amazing....came with goat cheese and covered in a delicious dill sauce, and I can't get over how tasty it was.  

My entree and dessert were equally good, the service was very attentive and friendly, and this is a must-eat. I just wish I lived in Montreal so I could visit frequently.  Chez Chose will live in my dreams until next time."}
{"text":"Has an amateurish vibe but friendly and comfortable.

Food is ok. Some were great (mushroom surprise amazing), some were bad (the beef dishes). 

I worry for their future"}
{"text":"J'ai de si bons souvenirs de mon souper chez chose! 

C'est un tout petit restaurant. Le service est fait par un couple (les deux propriétaires) des plus sympathique et une seule personne en cuisine se démène pour nous faire saliver. 

Ce qui m'a le plus enchanté? Un menu à l'ardoise posé sur un chevalet que le serveur amène directement à votre table et vous explique plat par plat (jusqu'à vous dire quel type de roquette il utilise)! Les menus sont faits de produits du Québec. 

Mentions spéciales pour les pétoncles au mojito que j'ai mangé qui étaient parfaits!

Bémol? Les prix ne sont peut-être pas à la portée de tous les budgets, mais c'est le prix à payer pour une aussi bonne qualité."}
{"text":"Quel délice! Service impeccable, menu à l'ardoise et plats recherchés. Une place de choix pour le brunch du dimanche!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service, and presentation. They were very kind. All the food seemed made with love."}
{"text":"Nice place in the plateau with a very knowledgeable and accomodating owner. Menu written on chalkboard and great variety of flavourful french dishes."}
{"text":"Really welcoming & friendly owners made it easy to chose among the unfamiliar items on the menu. One of the two host-owners to translate the extensive menu into English & the other was willing to help us with the wine list without sales pressure. Their daughter is the talented chef in the kitchen. I had porcelette, my companions a polenta casserole and a risotto and all were delicious. Cheese, Pavlova meringue or Brownie for dessert? All were delicious. Kitchen got confused about our order and our wait was long, but we didn't notice & I didn't deduct stars because they all dealt with it graciously."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent menu, well presented and the owner is a real character. Always treats us well. And the food is spectacular."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Owner is super nice and knowledgable. Good is fresh, local, and delicious.   I'd come back to Montreal just to come here again!
Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly and attentive staff. The food was brilliant. We had a valentines meal here last year and are returning this year."}
{"text":"My favorite meal in Montreal! We discovered this place a few years ago on a previous visit to Montreal. They have since moved from St Denis street to the quieter rue Bélanger. Same friendly owners, cute decor and amazing food! This is seasonal farm fresh fare at it's best. Portion size is perfect and I absolutely loved everything I tasted. The duck amuse Bouche was a great start, with nice smokey flavor on crispy baguette bread. For appetizers we tried the sweet potato soup which had a nice kick to it and the mushroom party which was a party in my mouth. It came with a perfectly cooked egg and melted cheese in a divine mushroom gravy. For my main I ordered the rabbit and it was juicy and tender, grilled to perfection. It was accompanied by seasonal veggies including tomatoes corn, carrots and beans on a bed of risotto. My husband had the vegetarian dish of sweet potato noodles topped with tofu, corn, peppers and broccoli. This dish was beautiful and had a bit of Asian flair.

I wish I could have tried all their dishes because everything looked and sounded amazing. This is definitely a must if you are visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"J'y suis allé dans le cadre de Montréal à table et je dois dire que j'étais assez étonnée de voir peu de monde. J'avais beaucoup entendu parlé de ce resto et effectivement la bouffe est excellente, avec des sauces aux goûts savoureux.
On nous a apporté des gens d'accras en amuse bouche en entrée, ainsi que du bon pain, et ensuite, nous avons pris l'échine de porcelet qui était très bonne et bien accompagnée, puis la crème brûlée dans la pomme, originale et très bonne également.
C'est vrai que c'est un menu à 41, alors qu'il y a des menus Mtl à table à 31 aussi bons.. mais bon, ça vaut la peine de tester ce resto qui est une institution à Montréal. Plaisir des papilles garanti!"}
{"text":"Very nice. Awesome food, great wine, extremely friendly service (never rush that's the best part for eating french). The guy knew we dont speak French so he spent 10mins explaining to us thoroughly what each dish is in English. We skipped main course because we had a late lunch, but the small plates, the wine and dessert that we ordered tell us that they make great food. Very unique but authentic frenchie. I need to come back soon!!!!!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch review: after hearing my boyfriend rant and rave about this place for a year I thought it about time to give it a try. We were lucky that it was a beautiful day and the restaurant was less than half full. The host (husband and wife couple) came running from the back of the restaurant to welcome my boyfriend back with hugs and kisses telling him that they missed him. Wow, I've never seen that happen anywhere in any restaurant I've ever been to.  I knew the service was going to be exceptional and it was.  Before leaving we were able to chat with the chef and praise the food. 
Oh yeah... Besides love and great service they can cook some pretty amazing food. I had the French Toast Monte Cristo. Holy shit, this was the most flavourful and savoury breakfast I've ever had. It's basically a grilled cheese with some pretty thick bread but stuffed with rabbit meat, garam masala, mustard... I thought I tasted some stewed raisins in there too but not sure. All topped with a sprinkle of maple syrup. Again... Best breakfast I've ever had!
Do yourself a favour and order the foie gras as an entrée.  For $10 it's a steal. 
They sold me on the cocktail of the day which was a gin and tonic with rhubarb juice and a few drops of beet juice for colour. One of the best gin tonics I've ever had. 
My bf had the egg stew in tomato sauce with leek and chorizo. I had a bite, it was good, but I was happy to have taken the \"French toast.\"
The filter coffee is bland. Nothing special. They should switch to different beans. 
I'll definitely be back for supper. This is a gem in Montreal and for the quality/price it's also a steal."}
{"text":"Family run business -- fantastic local food with a french flair.  I came here once several years ago, on a Groupon no less and was surprised and delighted.  I have stopped with those coupons because it's usually a crappy deal but these guys really outdid themselves delivering excellent value, service and overall experience.

The main thing that kept me going back was the ambiance.  It was VERY nondescript.  But unless you go to Toque or Maison Boulud, Montreal has a lot of little restaurants...  

For the food, I think it's one of the best in Montreal.  Professional chef.  Food was really delicious, very flavorful, generous portions and very good value.  

I see that it's classified under comfort food.  But it was actually quite refined."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem . We chose this place for 2 reasons 1) we wanted to support a female chef and 2) we were intrigued by the name. We thought if somebody can name their restaurant chez chose they must be alot of fun and have no pretention. Boy, we were right! This place is the perfect mix of mindblowing food with a laid back vibe. Its a family business . The parents run the front of the restaurant and their daughter is the chef. The dads laugh and energy is contagious which makes the service amazing. I believe the mother is the sommeliere and she's Lovely. You could tell that everybody in this place is a passionate. I went there during Montreal en lumieres and we had the tasting menu . The theme was Lyon this year so the menu was highly influenced by the region. I was blown away by the quality and quantity of food we were served.  In the same night  I was blessed with: brioche bread stuffed with a lyonnaise sausage, 3 style oysters, duck magret, rabbit, deer and for desert we were served a \"pogne\" which is a bread type desert from the  Lyon region. 
It was dirt cheap for the quality (55$) 
I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is an unpretentious place with a very sophisticated menu. Everything served was quite good. We appreciated the effort to use local ingredients. Its clearly a family affair; Maitre'D, Server and Chef all very capable and nice. You'll spend about $40-60 per person for the food and another $20-30 for wine. No wow factor here,but,definitely a solid choice."}
{"text":"Au-delà de mes attentes. Les plats offerts sont délicieux, les portions généreuses, et le services est excellent. Je vous recommande de l'essayer. Belle expérience."}
{"text":"Endroit à découvrir, service chaleureux, propre et très bon repas. Bonne cuisine.
Belle découverte.?"}
{"text":"Great family run service with deliciously flavourful food.  Casual environment."}
{"text":"Service super sympa mais j'étais déçue par le menu du brunch, un peu gras et trop sucré. 
À réessayer le soir pour comparer."}
{"text":"My sister and I had an excellent dinner here on our recent trip to Montreal.  The owner is a super nice guy--he even went to the trouble to go through the entire menu (which was in French) in English for us, without us having to ask. He and his wife are the servers, and their daughter is the chef. Very charming.

We had a very difficult time choosing what to order because everything sounded so amazing.  After some deliberation, we ended up ordering the beet salad and duck breast to start, and then we shared the lobster with risotto for our entree.  All were fresh, light, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Our favorite of the night (and perhaps the entire trip) was the lobster. I will dream about that dish from now on!  An entire lobster tail and huge claw with roasted vegetables atop a mound of perfectly-cooked risotto.  At the owner's recommendation, we had a bottle of Marselan, which paired very well with our meal and did not break the bank. We also ordered the nougat with biscotti for dessert--a light and fluffy end to our meal.

The ambience of the restaurant is calm, with dim lights and quiet music. It would be perfect for an intimate dinner. We had a glass of sparkling wine inside before moving outside to eat. It was fun to sit on the sidewalk patio and enjoy our food as well as the \"living room\" summer weather!

I would recommend Chez Chose to anyone who appreciates good quality food and attentive, personalized service. I will definitely stop here on my next trip to Montreal!"}
{"text":"Ate there tonight. Gave the waiter complete carte blanche as to what to bring.

For entrees (appetizers for Americans) we had the lobster salad, fois gras and the cheese baked in pastry. All three were great. Ranked in order from best to 3rd best it was fois gras, baked cheese and then the lobster.

For mains, we had the venison (mmmmmm, yummy) and the rabbit (ok, but would try different next time).

For dessert, we shared the Chai cream. Also very good.

The overall experience was outstanding. Waiter was perfect, even bringing our 8 year old a bowl of french fries (clearly not on the menu) without us requesting it."}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant. A little out of the way and the neighborhood looks sketchy but the most welcoming couple own the restaurant and they'll spend half an hour explaining the menue to you in detail.  We LOOOVED this place"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about Chez Chose. It is hands down my favorite restaurant in Montreal. I personally prefer Chez Chose to Joe Beef.

The wait staff (parents of the chef) is extremely nice and caring. The father read us the whole menu with extreme detail on what we would get with our order. 

I had the rabbit and my girl friend had the venison. Both of the dishes were quite exquisite. It was my first time having rabbit, and it was much better than I expected. The meat was extremely soft and didn't even require a knife to cut. 

If you are in Montreal, I would highly recommend giving this restaurant a chance."}
{"text":"This is a wonderfully well operated restaurant - run by an amazingly hospitable family.  The food, drink, and atmosphere were everything I hoped for - a fantastic place to celebrate a special occasion."}
{"text":"I don't know why i don't give it a 5 star, it's probably one of my top 5 restaurants in montreal! I think it's probably because i keep coming back and my wallet bleeds each time when i take more wine when i supposed to be in this happy & lay-back environment with friends! 
My takes from a few experience here 1) deer steak is no longer the best in town - some new  restaurants start to catch up.  2) The seafood/fish dish surprised me by how good it is (believe me, i'm a seafood snob who don't normally trust quebecois on this :P)   3)anything with mushroom is excellent and almost addictive!  4) the friendly owner makes you wanna drink well and drink a lot- hence, my wallet situation..."}
