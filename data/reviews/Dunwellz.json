{"text":"We have tried this new, locally owned place 3 times now. The first time was shortly after they opened ,so we will excuse the bumps in the service-which was lack of service. We actually had to flag wait person down to ask to get service. Meanwhile the person I take to be the owner is standing at the end of the row of tables talking to friends. Finally order the food and are served. No problem with the food at all. Very tasty burgers & fries. Onion rings kind of weak.  Second trip everything is fine, good service, good food. The one problem was the delay in the charge card - husband put the tip on the card, but noticed the next morning when he checked his bank statement on line it didn't show the tip. Not wanting the server to think we didn't tip her, he went up later that day and gave her the tip. Of course, the next day the separate charge for the tip comes through. Oh well. Last night was the 3rd visit. Greeted at the door by 2 hostesses & taken to our table. And then we wait. And wait. And wait. We can count 8 servers millling around. We finally ask the hostess to send a waitress over. Once again food is fine. Interesting note is the owner actually came by the table to pick up an empty plate- never said a word to us. For a local place, I really would think speaking to your guests would go a long way in getting them to return. Training someone to be in charge of the floor and take notice of what's going on would help as well.  Would we return? Not really sure- there's a lot of good burger places out there that have good food, good service and really appreciate the fact that you choose to support their business."}
{"text":"I love this place! Fun, casual atmosphere, sports bar-ish, but there is seating to eat separated from the bar. Fried pickles, blackened fish sandwich, burgers, everything I've had here has been delicious!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere , plenty of well placed television sets to watch any sport that may be on. Food is good and prices are good !"}
{"text":"I would give a negative 2 if it would let me! Our party of 8 attempted to eat here tonight. We walk in and were never greeted. Young girls standing at the welcome podium chatting, messing with their phones and drinking their drinks. After 5 minutes one girl looks up and ask how many proceeds to tell us it is a 25 minute wait then takes off and didn't return for a bit. She didn't write us down. Another girl asked us how many then wrote us down. They kept seating tables of 2 instead of pushing two tables together at that point we had been waiting 25 minutes. We waited another 25 minutes and decided to leave. After cancelling our table two members of our party was still in the building talking to family members that are regulars there to over hear the waitstaff get told the 8 top decided to leave and the others to excitedly say thank goodness, i'm glad....hmmm I will never step foot in that door again. Someone missed out on a very nice tip...."}
{"text":"Great place! I 'misordered' and they were very nice about correcting it and making exactly what I wanted.  An excellent addition to the Mint Hill restaurant options. Yummy food. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the $.60 wings this evening.  We tried a few of their sauces. I enjoyed the kickin bourbon and the bbq.  I also liked the $1.50 pabst on tap!  The bartender was nice and provided good service.  The bar was pretty busy and the I enjoyed the televisions.  Not really sure about the music that was playing but an overall nice experience."}
{"text":"Really tasty burgers.  I had the meatloaf burger with fries and it was big and tasty. Previous reviews are right- the play it safe on the draft beers. But overall nice experience."}
{"text":"Overpriced, limited selection, noisey, slow service. Did I mention overpriced. Go elsewhere and save your time and money."}
{"text":"Food quality here is above average.  Fried pickles are a must-have when we visit.  Daughter is a fan of the spicy buffalo chicken sandwich as well.  I like the build-your-own burgers.  It's become a really popular Mint Hill bar and restaurant.  Can get crowded at times, but great place to hang out with friends.  It will get loud, as can be expected, when crowded.  Wait staff are friendly and attentive.  They have outside seating on the patio, and cornhole boards.  Inside features all the college and pro sports games on flat screens, and music on the jukebox.  All around, great neighborhood bar and grill."}
{"text":"Great place!  Good food and service!  Reasonably priced.  Daily drink specials.  GOOD WINGS!  Try the Cuban sandwich, It's awesome!  Kid friendly. Purdy waitresses!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time Thursday night for wing night. Fantastic wings!!! So many different kinds to try!! Fabulous fries!! Great atmosphere! Great music! Couldn't wait to tell my son. We don't go out to eat as a family to often but this is our kind of place! Brought my son Friday night and again had a great experience. My son built a beautiful salad, I had the taco salad and of course a side of fries. Next week we're trying burger's and fish fry! Wish we had this place instead of Hickory Tavern in Sun Valley. 4 out of 5 cause it's not big enough. But, worth the 30 minute wait on a Friday night"}
{"text":"What a great place.  They have an extensive beer selection and some great sandwiches.  My wife had the Buffalo chicken sandwich and said it was the best she'd ever had.  I had the meatloaf burger, which was incredible.  My oldest son had a burger which he said, and I quote: \"almost brought him to tears\".  My youngest had the BBQ wings, which he loved.  Great service too.  We were there after 1:00 on a Saturday and it was still crowded but food came out fast and hot.  This will likely be our new go-to joint.  Can't recommend enough.  Plus, they're locally owned, which is a bonus.  This part of Charlotte has too many crappy chains or unremarkable local places.  This place has verve and great unpretentious eats."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here on 5 different occasions, (Work across the street). The wings, and hamburgers are great. I even ordered the salmon dinner and that was cooked to perfection!! The steamed veggies were blah- no taste but steamed veggies right. French fries are tasty and crispy!! The ambience of the place is fun, they have trivia night and other theme nights. I have yet to go in and eat in but will soon. I recommend them."}
{"text":"The service is HORRIBLE! I can't speak to the quality of food, because we didn't make it past the hostess stand. The owners need to question why they are paying the three hostesses to stand around and socialize with each other, instead of seating paying customers."}
{"text":"Love this place. They have the best chicken caesar wrap in the city. I live in Charlotte and used to work in Mint Hill. I would go there for lunch and I've always received excellent service and great food. They never disappoint. I haven't found a place in Charlotte that compares yet. It's a long drive for me but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"Mediocre food that is expensive. Build your own sandwiches for 9.00  portions are small. Best thing was the sweet potatoe tots (all 10 they give you). Had a  side of ranch dressing that was watery!!!  Place has potential but needs to rethink either their prices or portions.  Another whiff for food in mint hill"}
{"text":"Nice place...however I'm from out of town and my first experience here was quite crappy. It was unfortunate, because it was a nice place. My food came out cold and the tortilla for my taco was cold and never put on the grill.  Took a really long time to bring me new ones, by then my friends had finished eating.  Afterwards everyone's check was brought out, she said mine was the only one she didn't have a pen for. Not that it's a big deal but I don't feel like I was treated with priority, although I was spending the same money as the others. You pay for a service and expect to get treated with respect, as customers we don't owe restaurants anything, be grateful of our patronage. You're employed because of our support. Please treat customers with respect. Will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"I love the food here!! Especially the salads! They have a great beer selection, and great drink specials. But this is also my favorite place to get a salad: it's a make your own, with blackened chicken. Yummy!!! So many places have precooked rubbery chicken but this is freshly grilled. Oh my! It is so good. And another great dish is the salmon tacos. The only drawback is the noise--it's a very popular place, so it can get quite noisy. But the food is worth it."}
{"text":"The pretzel bun for my brat was excellent. The brat itself was pretty good. The televisions are slightly cramped if you want to watch a few NFL games from different divisions."}
{"text":"Fabulous soup, great beer selection and delicious fried Oreos. The staff is always friendly and service is good."}
{"text":"I decided to come here by myself. I ordered the Italian burger with fries.   The fries were great! Very crunchy and seasoned amazing! You don't need ketchup. The burger was pretty good. It wasn't as juicy as I expected for a burger place but it wasn't dry. The only other critique I would have for the burger is a little more sauce, so order extra!!"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Food is only average. Burgers are safe bet and Wings are good but small. The bar is well stocked and Trivia Night is fun."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood spot. The wings and the burgers are top notch. Well, everything. Lol! The specials and the games and activities are fun. I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because takeout has issues. I can honestly say there is usually an issue when you pick up.  Check your order. They are amazing when you catch it, though. Top notch customer service - you just have to wait for your order to be remade but it is usually with a free soda and if really botch they will give you a discount. I tried the online ordering but got caught in a glitch where I could not select all flappers AND fried, then grilled. Love this place, tho."}
{"text":"I travel for work extensively and this place seemed like a great place to get a meal. It was busy so I sat at the bar and waited patiently. A good bit of time goes by, wait staff look at me multiple times, and no one said a word to me. One bartender was chatting it up leaning on a cooler with both elbows and looked at me multiple times, literally next to me, and she didn't say a word, just kept talking to her friends. Not a place I'd ever go back to or recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is great! Fantastic specials and the service is great. Great place to relax, have a beer, and build your own burger. The co-owner was cleaning tables and stopped by the table to welcome us to Mint Hill for the first time. Looking forward to the next time I'm in Mint Hill."}
{"text":"Can't imagine spending my Monday nights anywhere else! The great deals they offer each night of the week. Monday night= wing night. Each wing was made soulfully, and wonderfully! Very impressed with the staff, customer service, food quality, price, and overall experience. Many options to chose from; however, if you are going for the first time, their soups and wings are great starters! A major plus is all the TV's for sports! Monday Night Football is best spent at Dunwellz!"}
{"text":"Very tàsty food great service,fair pricing. A little loud for our liking but will certainly be going back."}
{"text":"Had the PIG.. What else can I say.. it was pretty awesome and loaded with flavor.. it will for sure put you to sleep haha . Im new to Mint hill and will update with 5 stars after I've tried the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Have been there several times in the past, food is always great. The po boy sandwich is killer. Since it's a smaller place it fills up quickly in the evenings, just a tip for ya."}
{"text":"Have eaten here several times, some with my spouse, some with a group of friends.  The food has been consistently good well cooked and well seasoned.  Orders arrive promptly.  We have had burgers, chicken sandwich, salad, fries.  The burgers have been very juicy.  Really like the \"create your own\" concept. The portions are quite large.  Wait staff is attentive.  Only negative is that the place is noisy. ."}
{"text":"Who wears Short Shorts? They do @ Dunwellz! Great job Ladies!"}
{"text":"Saturday night at 8pm I scored myself a HUGE burger, built to my preference with a side for only $7.50 which is their speciality every Saturday after 7pm - I got it to-go so I can't comment on the service but I built my burger with Bacon, Mozzarella, guacamole, lettuce, onion and pickles! Pub chips with ranch were not fried properly, a lot of the chips were over cooked and extremely oily. So they tasted like burnt oil and the burger was also COVERED in grease.. it must of been from the bacon or melted cheese? But it was almost soggy when I unwrapped it to eat and the drive was only 8 minutes home from the restaurant. After dabbing up the grease on the burger bun which required 3 napkins total  the flavor was great and the burger was cooked and built to exactly my request! It was a thick, juicy patty with a lot of flavor and I would definitely try this place again, especially if I'm in the area on a Saturday night. Hopefully the greasy-grease overload was just a fluke and it's not always like that"}
{"text":"I could not believe when someone walked up behind me after I just sat down with my coworker and some bald-headed gentleman walked in just after I paid my tab. The food was terribly greasy please take your Statin before you go there and for some reason whoever this person was very unrespectful to the patrons and I did not feel like getting into a confrontation at that time. I also thought the food was overpriced for what you were getting come on it's just ground beef."}
{"text":"My wife and I along w/ my 2 little boys recently went to Dunwellz.  As we entered the restaurant the hostess told us we can sit anywhere. So being that we have two little ones and don't want to disturb others we took a corner table in the back.  The 1st issue was we waited over 10 minutes just for someone to take our drink order.  Not for beer or soda, just to get water.  As the waitress approached our table she appeared that she was not happy to see us sitting in her section as she rolled her eyes and gave us the \"look\".  Once the waitress took our order, she was back in about 5 minutes w/ our drinks which is OK since the restaurant was starting to fill up around 1pm.  We placed our order (wife ordered Mushroom Swiss Burger & I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich).  My wife however asked that instead of Swiss Cheese they add American cheese.  Pretty simple request I thought.  20 minutes later food came.  We were starving and ready to enjoy our lunch and of course my wife's' burger had Swiss cheese instead of American.  Now, if this was the 1st time, honest mistake, I can accept that, but this was the 2nd time the kitchen made my wife's burger incorrect.  We had been there a couple of weeks earlier ordering the same things.  So, both waitresses both times confirmed they keyed American cheese into the POS and they confirmed it with the receipt so shame on the kitchen staff for not getting this right.  So the waitress took the burger back and then within a minute the burger came back w/ American cheese, but you could clearly see that all they did was scrap off the swiss (which by the way there was still little bit on there) and then they placed a cold piece of american cheese on the burger.  So my wife now had to eat a semi warm burger that has been handled multiple times w/ a cold piece of american cheese, gross!    The other thing that was very annoying is our waitress was not attentive at all and I had to flag her down at least 4-5 times for another beer, clean up and the check. The waitresses were huddled together by the soda machine checking their cell phones and talking.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good, I enjoy the vast selection of craft beers, but if I was a new comer and had this experience I would assume Dunwellz wait staff and kitchen staff pays no attention to detail and also doesn't wait to pay attention to families w/ little kids."}
{"text":"Ordered in from here last night.  A bunch of apps and some custom order \"burgers\". They even helped my walk the order our to my csr.    Ken Courtney"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night and didn't know they where doing 60 cent wing and boy was they good the bartender was great I think his name was nick but I will be going back to this place"}
{"text":"They need to learn about seasoning salt..all those wing flavors for nothing...burger taste like ground beef no seasoning.  Fries was the best thing I ate...i won't waste my $40 ever with them again"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and we have already been twice. Everything we ordered has been great. Love the creative cocktails and the burgers are super good!"}
{"text":"Great little place.  Wonderful atmosphere.  Ery friendly. The menu had a variety of selections.  My burger was cooked perfectly and had a nice flavor.  Loved the sweet potato tots!   Nice selections of beer. Had a very non- rushed relaxing lunch . Nice jod."}
{"text":"A reliable local burger and salads place. Easy to eat healthy here...or enjoy their amazing sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"Another miss for Mint Hill. Very over priced food that's not good at all. That advertise corn hole tournaments on Sunday but don't plan on playing anyone. The vibe is also terrible. Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great food and nice staff. I wish their seating was more like booths and not tables but that's the only downside for me personally. Great local place!"}
{"text":"I decided to stop in for lunch and check out this place to see what it was all about. The rumor was that it was going to be a type of build your burger joint and for once the rumors were pretty spot on. While the food itself is kinda what I would call on the level with \"bar food\" (ie burgers, wings, etc) it is all very well prepared. There wasn't one hiccup in either my order or the food itself which it seems like a lot of times when you try new places they usually tend to mess something up. Not the case here which imo goes to show they know what they are doing.   For lunch I had some chips and queso for a app and the queso was kind of standard but the chips themselves were more of a high quality restaurant style which were served piping hot and tasted awesome. I followed that up with a Turkey burger and some sweet potato tots. The patty on the turkey burger was seasoned extremely well and tasted delicious. The sweet potato tots were top notch and served with a honey cinnamon dip that complemented them very well. The one thing that I gotta say that was cool about the burgers is that they let you choose multiple toppings and don't nickle and dime you to death on the price for each additional item. I think it's like 50 cents extra for chili but all the standard stuff is gratis which is awesome.   The only one down side I can say about the place is that they had country music as a static background. It fits the place well but seeing how I personally hate country music I just had to suffer through it with the meal but that didn't detract from the excellent service or food at all."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab a sandwich and have a beer. Friendly staff and good food. Everything I've  tried so far in the menu has been good."}
{"text":"Dunwellz is a great thing to have in Mint Hill - since Mint Hill really doesn't have a lot. The food is acceptable, the beer selection is great (plenty of craft beers and regular specials on those too), and the atmosphere is pretty comfy.   Trivia is Tuesdays there, started at about 7.45pm when I went, and it was crowded! Get there early if you want a table during trivia, since it's not that big of a restaurant. Trivia is great there, questions were a good mix of pop culture and actually important stuff - ;) - and the host is nice. All kinds of prize opportunities throughout the game, but it does seem to get pretty competitive."}
{"text":"Sat at bar, Ton's of tv's! They have Guinness on tap!! Place was kinda busy for Friday afternoon 2ish. Salmon BLT was good, not dry, good flavor. Barely ate the tots as sandwich was good size. Burger ordered medium rare. as bartender said not much seasoning/flavor but was juicy. Onion rings good...too wide and seemed not cooked long enough.  Bartender was awesome. poor thing the liquor shelves were put too high up the wall behind the beer taps. Got footstool?! Will visit again"}
{"text":"Pretty good for our first time....We ordered our food to-go so we don't get the dine in experience. I think if we actually ate there the food may have been better, BUT the food still taste good. Our appetizers and fries were our favorite. My husband wasn't a fan of the chicken flavors he had chosen and I prefer my quesadillas with peppers and alot of cheese. If we had eaten inside our experience may have been a tad different."}
{"text":"Tried Dunwellz last night and the wings were absolutely the best wings I've had anywhere without driving 30 minutes out of your way. We normally eat wings at The Hill Grill,which are great wings, but the way Dunwellz prepares theirs were more of our taste, slighty smaller wing which fries up better and gives it a great taste.Lots of sauce selections, and the prices are more reasonable than any other place in the area.The onion rings were also good. Great drinks. Will definitely be going back to try one of the build your own burgers. They have great food and drink specials daily."}
{"text":"Ordered buffalo shrimp to go while on lunch and let me tell you, that was the best and the largest shrimp ever!!! I could eat it every day !!! A must try!!! I also love their queso dip"}
{"text":"Our Saturday evening visit to Dunwellz was ok. Waited 15 to be seated. My daughter's turkey burger was so salty, it was barely edible. Hubby and I got beef burgers. They were better than average (think Five Guys). I didn't care for tv's all over the dining area. It was also very loud. The star rating didn't offer \"middle of the road\" so I went with A-ok."}
{"text":"Amazing place. They have a great beer selection, both bottled and draft. We tried the queso and BBQ chicken flatbread pizza. The queso is served in an edible bowl and the pizza was so good. Excellent bar food. Everyone who works here is friendly and so are the patrons. This is our first visit, but we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar, bartender was very attentive without being annoying.  On one hand, the beer selection is good - for example, 4 of 5 taps are local and that is awesome.  On the downside, all of the beers were very, very safe choices and nothing that stood out.  Ordered a burger and got chips instead of fries.  Chips were OK but I did wonder how old the oil was.  Burger was on the VERY RARE side of \"Medium Rare\", I just know some of the times I have requested medium at other establishments it gets cooked all the way through.  This one was still mooing but it was tasty all the same.  I forgot my wallet, but thankfully have memorized a credit card number - not sure how that would have worked out...I'd probably still be there washing dishes! I will give a different dish a try next time, hopefully they will work on improving their beer selection."}
{"text":"Eaten here a few times but probably not again. Food wasn't bad but not exceptional. Burgers are ok. Shrimp po boy - not worth the money. Chaotic atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was above average and the service was good too. I had the turkey burger and sweet potato tots and they were both really good. The tots come with a cinnamon butter dipping sauce on the side and it was awesome. I highly recommend it. My girlfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich and she said it was good too.  Beer selection had everything you need, including some of the regional micro brews. Sweet Josie Brown Ale is among my favorites they have, Looking forward to coming back when we feel like pub food."}
{"text":"This was just okay. The fried Pickles were delicious. They had a nice heat that remained as after taste. The chicken tenders were your general run of the mill tenders, the Korean barbecue tacos tasted like unseasoned London broil that was chewy and not able to be consumed in a single bite. The fries were pretty good and well seasoned. We got a side of ranch that had lumps all throughout. It was questionable if the ranch was bad as it had an odd aftertaste.   Service was good."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome! Good wings and good beer selection. They get 4 stars because the wings were a bit on the small side."}
{"text":"Like I say, today was my first time ever. I love the food and the staff were very friendly. What I like about it that place has so many televisions that I can watched and enjoy, while I'm eating"}
{"text":"This is a nice place. Nothing special but the food was Kool and they had some drink specials. I had the Turkey Reuben and fries. I went on a Sunday around 2 in the afternoon so it wasn't crowded, I was able to get in and out without much hassle. I will give them a try again. I talked to a few ppl and they gave me some other options for food the next time I come thru. They say the meatloaf burger is HUGE."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed the food there and am happy to say that it was good. I would come back and bring my friends. It's a little hard to find but it's there in the corner."}
{"text":"The burger was great and we had excellent customer service. Friday's are very busy. This is a great place for families."}
{"text":"Food is really good. The service is excellent.  However this place is really BRIGHT.  All the lights are on and bright no matter what time of day it is. My wife and I came in at 11pm for a couple beers.  All the lights  were still on. At some point most bars turn down their lights after the dinner rush.  I wish they would start doing this.  Besides that, I really like the place."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place four stars, let me explain why. My family thinks it was a five star place, but, to be honest, the wings definitely didn't impress me, and the buffalo chicken sandwhich was acceptional, but not outstanding. The service was absolutely outstanding! The price is well worth it! Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"The place was filled with people, which was to be expected on St. Patrick's Day. My husband and I were pretty pleased with the burgers we got - everything was done well, and there were lots of options for what to get on your burger. I liked how you could order one of their recommended creations, or create your own from lots of options. It was tasty, but it didn't stick in my mind as a place I would crave to visit again."}
{"text":"We tried Dunwellz for our first time tonight. It was disappointing to say the least. My wife got the Reuben, which was just ok, I got the jambalaya which had a weird taste and wasn't worth the $13 I paid for it. We ordered the fried pickles which was advertised as \"1/2 pound\" which was a whole lie. We had maybe 15 small fried pickles for $7.25. The atmosphere was absolute chaos. We spent almost $40 for a dinner for 2, and were very disappointed. If you want to find a place where the food and service is \"Dunwell\" don't let the name fool you, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time here. Great experience. Great menu selection (food and lots of beers!). Went for lunch.  Prompt service..great job and very attentive server.  I had a BYOS (build your own salad)!! Very good!! Will be back for dinner and alcohol next time!! Thanks to all the staff!"}
{"text":"Better than expected. I have been here multiple times for lunch and dinner and never a complaint about the food. Waitstaff is a bit on the immature side but it is half a bar."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! My neighbor told me about this place & I just had to check it out. Awesome bar food, cool setting, etc. I tried the brisket grilled cheese one time. This most recent time I tried the pot roast sandwich, which had pot roast, mashed potatoes, and gravy all on the sandwich! Also highly recommend the sweet potato tots with this amazing honey cinnamon butter they serve on the side. Haven't had the room for dessert yet, but that menu features lava cake & fried Oreos, so bring your appetite."}
{"text":"This was such a wonderful experience!! The food was amazing and fresh!! Mac n cheese, club sandwiches and chicken tenders were bomb. The pub chips were yummy too!"}
{"text":"Great wings, burgers and salads! Always a good time for daddy-daughter chicken wings Saturday afternoons!"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a quick meal for lunch. Wait staff is always friendly and their burgers are always on point. It's the only thing I have tried but why worry about changing it up when it's good.  Oh yea and their fries are legit"}
{"text":"Health risk. I would avoid any place that thinks it's smart to serve rotten vegetables in 2 wraps, it was slimy and tangy. When we called to complain the manager wouldn't even come to the phone. Save yourself the poor service and awful food and just avoid it."}
{"text":"The service and dinner options were great. We tried the wings, tacos and sandwiches. Everyone loved their food, which rarely happens. This restaurant was close to our hotel which was great."}
{"text":"Thursday night in Mint Hill means wings. Should you go to Dunwellz or The Hill Grill just down the road? It's very simple. Dunwellz has a better beer selection and cheaper wings. The grill has better wings, a decent beer selection, but a much better atmosphere (unless heavy metal is your thing). Winner: The Hill."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a quick update. Dunwellz has really stepped up on food quality and presentation. They changed the menu since my last review added new things got rid of others, I do miss the chicken penne as it was one of my favorites. The build your own burger is always a great option as well as the salads, and there mac and cheese is tasty. My only one wish is it wasn't so loud it's so hard to talk to others at your table and I feel like I always have to ask the waitress to repeat what she said. The service is great everyone is really friendly and on the ball. This restaurant is one of the best around!"}
{"text":"Love me some Dunwellz, I'm from out west, and since I've been to Charlotte Dunwellz has been my favorite burger joint for sure. Staff is friendly and food is great!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go after work or when you just feel like getting out. Among the other places in Mint Hill, this new spot holds its own. The food is fresh, very tasty and the menu has a good variety. The staff is super friendly and do a great job of making the customers happy. The atmosphere is fun and free flowing. They also have a back patio with plenty of seating as well as corn-hole. Great for a cool summer night! See you there!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are awesome! My son and I came here a few months ago for the first time. Everyone was very friendly. The owner stopped by to say hello and ask how our experience was. Have had several to go orders since then. I always get a burger because they are so good, so I can't speak for any of the other items. Great place!"}
{"text":"Love to come here when I am in town for work. Service is great and the food is amazing. All the way from appetizer to dessert are amazing I highly suggest you stop in for the food and casual environment."}
{"text":"I had the Korean BBQ tacos and they were very tasty!  Great skirt steak, my side was the sweet potato tots. Husband ordered the fish tacos and he liked them too. His side was macaroni and cheese topped wih bacon, he said he wished it had tasted a little cheesier.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the negative reviews for poor service, we saw nothing but attentive servers when we went for lunch.   I can't comment on the beer selections, we don't drink, but my Diet Coke was very refreshing. We went because I heard from a friend that they had a diverse menu, which they do.   We started with a yummy southwest egg roll app served with a chipotle ranch dipping sauce. A little too spicy for my 14 year old, but Alina and I enjoyed them. Alex ordered the make your  own burger, which she said was very tasty. She also had a side of baked potato soup, which she liked even more than her burger. Alina ordered the make your own fish sandwich, which was way too big for her to finish. Alina really liked the potato bun, it went great with the crunchy fish filet. I ordered the 1/2 lb chicken tenders app as my meal. I asked for a side of bbq sauce, and guess what? It arrived with the meal, I didn't have to send the server back to get it. The tenders were small, but abundant. I'm a big guy, but I couldn't finish the fries. Oh, I finished the tenders, no worries there. I was very happy with my menu choice, it was great.  If I had to find 1 con, it was that lunch for 3 with only 2 sodas came to $41, a little pricey for lunch. If we are ever back in Mint Hill, we will definitely return for another great meal."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time around 8:00 on a Sunday evening. It is essentially a sports bar that serves up pretty good food and has friendly, attentive service.  My wife and I both ordered tacos. The braised beef, although a bit salty, was tender and tasty and was served with sour cream. The side salad was fresh and loaded with good stuff.  The shrimp tacos came piled high with medium sized shrimp and a delicious wasabi sauce. The sweet potato tater tots with cinnamon butter were addictive. Overall bill was about $29 without tip.  Rounding things out, the atmosphere was casual and the sanitation score was an impressive 97.5. Would consider returning if in the area. If Yelp allowed, I'd rate it closer to a 3.5 than a 3."}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise. If you're a fan of having a delicious burger or sandwich made exactly the way you want it, you can't go wrong grabbing lunch here. The wait staff was more than accommodating with the food and drinks as well as the 10 tv screens to split between the fans of various teams on a Sunday afternoon. We split a burger and a pizza flatbread and both were delicious, but the sweet potato tater tots were especially good. We also liked the emphasis they placed on beers brewed locally in various cities of NC."}
{"text":"Wow! So impressed. Elevated bar food.  We were not disappointed.  Homemade chicken breast tenders.  Excellent brisket grilled cheese.  The buffalo chicken sandwich was the best we have had.  My Korean BBQ tacos were so tasty.  We didn't try dessert but we will be back."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was excellent. We got a table right away and drinks too. Our appetizer was great (mozzarella sticks) and so were the giant burgers. We got the Mac and cheese chili burger and the donut burger. We could not eat all the burgers and the generous helping of fries.   Great spot when in Mint Hill"}
{"text":"Good chicken wings and okay prices on most things. Manager and servers all attentive and friendly, food is decent, prices aren't bad."}
{"text":"My family and I were there for dinner on a Wednesday at 6 pm. There was no wait and the staff was friendly once you walked in.   We ordered the fried pickles for appetizers which my kids liked so that's a plus! My husband liked the dressing more than the fried pickle. He also thought the sweet tea was perfect cause it didn't taste like full on sugar load.  I ordered the salmon street tacos and I actually enjoyed the flavor of it. Sweet potato tots were my side dish and it came with a sweet butter sauce. I was actually fine without it cause the tots tasted sweet already. But I wasn't able to finish my second taco cause I thought it was plenty!  Our server was attentive and sweet. I appreciate when you don't have to request for extra refills and they are aware to provide without calling on them.   Not sure I'll be rushing back soon but definitely will visit again to try their other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Sucks.  Worst wings I have had. We ordered take out for the game. They only drizzled sauce on top of wings and nothing else."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, including lots of craft beers. Menu has a great variety and everything I've tried has been good. Nice outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Food was just ok here. I got the turkey Reuben which was decent but the fries were awesome. Drink specials were relatively non existent even on a Sunday and the atmosphere was kinda gross. So loud I couldn't hear who I was sitting with (music sucked anyway) and the decor was pretty \"dinerish\". I really wanted to sit at an outside table but a bunch of people were sitting on tables smoking (so disappointed ugh). I guess I was expecting something a little more classy??"}
{"text":"The kids and I went here and enjoyed it very much.  One built his own burger, the other his own chicken wrap, and I got the meatloaf sandwich. The portions were tremendous and the service was very good, even though the place was quite crowded.  I won't be raving to everyone I meet, but it's a lovely option here in Mint Hill, so nice to have somewhere to go that isn't a chain, and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love this gem in Mint Hill their food is consistently good and this time I really appreciated our waitress's attentiveness. Highly recommend you try their brisket grilled cheese it's so spicy and delicious I didn't know if I should eat more or wipe my face! It's hot but the jalapeños have this sweetness to them that was just bomb!"}
{"text":"Best burgers in my opinion and I had my staple: donut burger with A1 and Dr. Pepper sauce,  added onion straws!  My daughter had fish and chips and that was great, a friend had fish tacos and loved them. Also had the honey chili shrimp and a phenomenal dessert! Brownie that was so light it felt like a mousse vs a brownie :)"}
{"text":"What a great selection - from burgers and wings to salads and sandwiches, there are so many options. But I knew when I tasted their salmon tacos, I made the right choice and found my favorite menu item. The salmon was perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked! Plus the sweet potato tots were a great choice for my side."}
{"text":"I loved this place!  The wait staff was super nice, and the food was good.  I enjoyed it, and next time I am in that area of town and get hungry, I'll stop in again."}
{"text":"Fun, sports bar type atmosphere. Food was fantastic!!! We split Korean tacos, ribs, breakfast burger and both fries. All of it so good!!!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Mint Hill. Friendly staff. Great beer selection and daily specials. Eclectic menu. Including the beautiful and tasty Doughnut burger and cinnamon sweet potato tots."}
{"text":"Attended a fundraising event and had a great time. Definitely will go back and enjoy more of all they have to offer."}
{"text":"This was pretty good.  There is a huge selection on the menu. We started with fried pickles, which were excellent. The one glitch was I ordered a medium hamburger, and it was overdone. But, it was still pretty good, just not perfect. The topping choices were many and tasted good.  The salad was perfect as were the fries.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, the value of a restaurant is significantly influenced by its surroundings. A good place can be less desirable if it's hard to get there. Conversely, a mediocre place can be great if it's convenient. Dunwellz falls into the latter category.  Dunwellz is fairly middle-of-the-road in both food and decor. The food is decent. It's not amazing: fairly typical bar quality, but it's not bad, either. My chicken quesadilla was filling and not dried out, but it was slightly on the bland side. The same could be said for P's burger. The menu is divided into appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and so on, and you get to \"build your own\" within each section. That's where the custom part comes in.   Nevertheless, Dunwellz is A-OK in my book, and the reason for that is they're open till 11:00 during the week. That makes them one of the few late-ish night options in Mint Hill. And for that, I say hooray."}
{"text":"Mmmmm definitely not 4 stars tried the new Habanera peach wings , not a hint of habanera just like a peach glaze . Ordered then crispy well that didn't happen either. On a positive note great burger good margarita and delicious potato salad and the best sweet potato tots I've had to date . They arrive with cinnamon butter which was to die for !"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Dunwellz is super chaotic. This wasn't the first time i have been here, but it will probably be the last. We were sat at a table that was apparently broken. When I put my arms on the table the whole thing started to flip over. My husband went up to the hostess who ignored him. The waitress came over and I demonstrated how the table was broken. She conferred with the hostess who didn't know where to sit us. After we were FINALLY seated, we waited for about 5 minutes for drink orders. I was about to get up and leave.  The food is pretty decent here. I like their burgers and wings. It's just too loud and too many kids running around."}
{"text":"You have to come here! If you hate South 21 (because it sucks) and their ilk of terrible bland 5 guys style awful burgers, then come to Dunwellz.   I had the breakfast burger - excellent. Sausage gravy was great and the sweet patato tots were the best I've had. Sweet and soft in the middle, crunchy exterior. Their beer batter fries are good as well.  My son had a quesadilla, straight out napoleon dynamite. His tortilla shell was crispy, as it should be, because it was cooked ib the griddle. Notice how most places that serve quesadilla around here serve it up with raw doughy bread?   I am satisfied. I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's hard for my husband and I to agree on where to eat but we ended up here and we're both happy. The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired but the food was good and it seemed like some effort was put into it. I was excited to see gf bread offered that's huge in my life"}
{"text":"Some really good bar food. They have specials everyday and different events that are really fun!! And their chicken tenders and fries are GREAT!! In high school we went every Friday and it was a great environment. The staff is very helpful and sweet!"}
{"text":"We just walked out after being seated for 15 minutes, and no one taking our order. We've been twice before. Every time the service has been slow, but nothing like today. Every time the waitresses have been standing over by the drink station talking while leaving customers waiting. When the left today the hostess who sat us didn't say a word. It's a shame they are so unprofessional, becacuse the food is actually good. They clearly don't care if they have customers or make money. The place is always only a third to a half full, but they can't actually serve the people trying to eat there.  EDIT: 1/16/13: We gave this place another try, and it was much better the second time. Have been back several times since with no issues. The food is very good."}
{"text":"Dunwellz is subject to what I call the \"Mint Hill Factor.\" Anywhere else in Charlotte, Dunwellz would be a 3-star place. In Mint Hill, it is definitely 4 stars, especially considering the alternatives (or the fact that there aren't really alternatives).   While it is far from a taproom, Dunwellz has a decent selection of beers on tap and in cans and bottles. They have regular drink specials as well. Sometimes you just want a simple beer from OMB, and Dunwellz delivers that.   The food is pretty good. I'm a big fan of the sweet potato tots with the crack/cinnamon sugar butter dipping sauce. The sandwiches are good but not great. If you're looking for decent pub food, you'll find it here.   I never seek out Dunwellz, but I'll come here now and then when I am sick of other local options. It's definitely not a destination if you're making any sort of trip."}
{"text":"First time visiting Dunwellz. About a 30 minute ride from Belmont and \"Wellz\" worth the drive! On the owners recommendation we shared The Notirious P.I.G.... A perfectly cooked Angus burger loaded with roasted pork and a spicy Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce, topped with cheddar cheese and onion straws! WOW!!!! We also shared the Mac & Cheese Empenadas (penne pasta with a blend of cheddar and Monterey Hack cheeses. Sooo darn delicious!! Great serves from Abi as well! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Dunwellz is fine dining meets a pub/bar/grill atmosphere if you ask me. Food is good if not great, especially the Notorious P.I.G. burger. I've only been there two times and I've ordered that sandwich both times and it's very good. Money is fair on the pocket in terms of price. You get can 2 good beers, a meal and a appetizer for around about $25 not too bad. I enjoy the atmosphere, it's nice to get out. And the people are friendly too. Just make sure you have plenty of napkins for this burger/sandwich!"}
{"text":"All I can say is Mint Hill needs more of places like this.  I don't always need fancy shmancy places to eat and drink.  When I'm off that kick, this is the kind of joint I like.  They let you make your own burger and they have a decent tap selection.    Combine all that with service and a smile then I'm a happy camper.  Dunwellz did well in my book!  You just don't want to walk in expecting anything more than a local hangout that has staple bar food.  Do that and you too will like it."}
{"text":"My wife and I go here weekly. Best beer selection in Mint Hill, burgers are good (not great) but building options are amazing. All the other food ( wings, fish N chips, nachos, standard pub fare) are awesome, and the beer prices are perfect."}
{"text":"Food has decline in quality! There's is no diversity in Dunwellz! Been frequenting this establishment for about six years, and one white male manager, refuses to look me in my eye or even speak to me. He has never spoken to me since I have been going to Dunwellz! Now that the good quality has declined... it's a great time for me to stop going to the neighborhood feeding hole. CHAR BAR 7 has better atmosphere, food and service!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to get a burger or chicken fingers or just about anything your tummy desires.  You have to try the Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce!  Hands down that stuff makes any meal there just that more amazing!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness. We came for the Fried Pickles but the wings were on point! I would totally recommend it to anyone looking for great BBQ wings and great southern hospitality!"}
{"text":"For a bar, this place was fantastic. Wide beer selection,  great atmosphere and terrific service. I have to come back here to try their food. Thrilled this place is in the neighborhood. The place was filled too with lots of friendly people having a good time. Perfect after work spot"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great daily specials! Good bar staff and super yummy food ! Mac and Cheese empanadas are a must !"}
{"text":"Fantastic burger made any way you want, and I mean ANY way. Choose everything from the bread to the mayo. The southwestern spring rolls are fantastic with a chipotle dipping sauce. I don't care much for a sports bar based restaurant, but the food is so good I'll be frequent flyer. 1st trip I got my burger on a bun, 2nd trip on texas toast. Both excellent. I'm not sure I'm ready to try a burger on a donut, but the waitress said it was good. Both trips we had very friendly and attentive waitresses."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times and always enjoy our food and service. Sweet potato tater tots with the cinnamon butter is sooo good. Service is good, and we've had burgers, wings, and a few other items and we've been pleased with everything."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers - friendly staff- outdoor seating appears to be dog friendly.  A ton of flavors for wings!"}
{"text":"I became interested in eating here, only because my bank offered me money back to do so.  So I thought what the heck, it's right around the corner from where you live try it.  So I did last Friday me and my family ate there, I got everything to go.  I wasn't that impressed by the food, like I thought I was going to be.  Me and my little girl enjoyed the carmel sauce that came with the apples she got with her meal it was very good.  My mom enjoyed her salad, I got the hamburger on texas toast with fries and some fried pickles.  I wasn't expecting the pickles to hot but they were, and that made me really upset. Any who, the burger well it was just ok nothing to shout about or be excited.  It was so good that the other half of it is still sitting in my refridgerator.   I hate that it wasn't that good because there aren't too many places to eat at around here.  I think that maybe I just ordered the wrong food, not sure if I will give it another try or not."}
{"text":"Our family is new to the area and we love Dunwellz.  I am not sure of any other restaurant that I regularly go to in which I choose so many different items on the menu.  I love the Hawaiian Chicken sandwich with the sweet potato tater tots and cinnamon butter dip.  The brisket grilled cheese sandwich is fantastic and on nights they have the tomato basil soup is a perfect combo.  The family loves the wings or Queso for an appetizer.   Trivia night is always fun for the family.  The staff is wonderful and do a great job turning tables to accommodate you pretty quickly on a busy night."}
{"text":"Good Food and Good Service...Great Daily Specials!!.They offer excellent grilled wings that are tossed in great sauces. The Burgers are always cooked exactly to order..Just simply a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to dinner spot! Best buffalo chicken sandwich in Charlotte! It's such a chill spot to watch the game, and have a delicious burger or salad. Very versatile menu, but mostly bar food, their fries are out of this world! They have activities like trivia on almost every day, and it's a good place for families."}
{"text":"We just ate lunch here. My friends had the Salmon Burger and said it was amazing. I had a flatbread pizza (the Breakfast one) and it was SOOOO good! We will def be back"}
{"text":"Best food in mint Hill in my opinion... I've never sat in and ate I always order take out. Generous portion size, everything I've tried has been pretty good. The sweet potato tots are delicious. I will definitely continue to order from here."}
{"text":"Well that was disappointing.  This was our Saturday night go to.  But when you have to wait for a hostess, they were sitting at a nearby table talking with a customer, then wait for them to determine which empty table to seat you at you should realize what's might come next.  I didn't expect warm beer, burnt pub chips, or limited follow up by the waitress...guess we'll take our $60, would have been more but no one asked if I wanted another beer or if we wanted dessert, and give it to one of the other restaurants in Mint Hill."}
{"text":"This place has become a staple in Mint Hill.  My parents love in the area and absolutely love coming here.    There are food and drink specials every day that are really good deals for those on a budget.  $2.50 bud lights, $7 burgers after 7 on saturdays etc.  We came to celebrate my dad's retirement and the staff was very accommodating.  They reserved a table for us and let us drop a cake off early!  I ventured out and tried the sweet potato and black bean burger in a wrap.  It was AHHHHMAZING.  My husband got wings, which are always on point, my mom and dad order the chicken sandwich on Texas toast (huge portion), my sister got the buffalo sandwich, and my sisters fiancé got the chicken tenders.  The food was brought out promptly and everyone devoured it quickly.  You can create your own salad or sandwich which is a nice menu addition as well!  I would recommend all of those options or the burger if you come after 7!"}
{"text":"Mint Hill does not have a bunch of variety when it comes to places to eat. Fast food? Sure. There is just about anything you want. Pizza? Several varieties. Even a few Asian joints. But there are only a couple of other choices, and it is nice to have Dunwellz on that short list.  The service at Dunwellz is generally solid whenever you come in, always friendly and keeping your glasses filled to the brim. The menu has a great selection of foods, all of which end with \"Z\" (saladz, sidez, soupz, etc).  What you won't find is anything really exceptional. It's all good, but unless you are already in Mint Hill, it probably isn't worth the drive all the way out here. You're looking at a typical hangout with fairly standard bar food."}
{"text":"Hit and miss on service. Food is always good, but service has its ups and downs. I have recently walked out while waiting on seating while watching the waitstaff huddle and giggle at the hostess stand and outside the kitchen. After this last visit we left early due to the outside seating being the place where everyone goes to smoke and compares f word enunciation's in front of my 3 kids. The waitress apologized. Like I said the food is always good! You must try the notorious PIG! And take out is always on point if you call ahead."}
{"text":"I love this place, when it isn't too crowded! That's the only problem: it is so popular that it is hard to find a seat and it is also very noisy. But I can't bring myself to put a lesser star rating because the food is SO good. I love the salad I design myself each time, with blackened chicken. Oh! it is yummy. And the salmon tacos with that special slaw (forget what it is called) --they are delicious!"}
{"text":"Ive read about this place for awhile finally gave it a try.  I was so disappointed i ordered a turkey reuben with fries . I wanted the fried pickles but they were spicy dang i dont do spicy. My turkey reuben was okay it was on texas toast an they had a special sauce yeah a reuben just needs a great swiss cheese an sauerkraut an thousand island . This reuben was lacking for sure now the fries were good lol looks like its really just a bar an wings are there signature thing. We left  about 9 they stsrted karaoke it got to loud an nobody was drinking enough yet I guess. Not my kind of place but if your looking for wings an beer thats seems to be a place to go."}
{"text":"A new hang-out in Mint Hill (with their opening, you now need 2 hands to count the local offerings!). We went early one evening to check them out.  On a Tuesday evening, they were packed (again, minimal choices locally). Luckily it was a nice evening, since the patio were their only seats. It is secluded, away from the parking lot and other traffic. There are a couple corn-hole sets to go with their picnic table seats. The hostess and server were very nice.  The food is OK. It wasn't abysmal, but I'm not counting down the days to go back, either. Typical bar food, though I was expecting everything to be a dollar or two less than it is.   They have a small, but decent, beer list as well as a few wines and mixed drinks.   They'll be a great option in the area when I want to go out for a beer but don't want to drive to University or South End."}
{"text":"Love Dunwellz for their bowl and cup of chili, actually my opinion it's the best chili I've had in the area. You'll find they have pretty good tacos great hamburgers love the crispy fries in the condiments. You can get great salads with a burger on the salad instead of bread really never had a bad dish here. The staff is great, service is wonderful and the speed to table is very good as well."}
{"text":"I come here all the time. 3 times in the past 2 weeks. Great place to hang out and watch the game. Definitely gonna be here for Super Bowl this year. The service is great and I haven't tried anything that I didn't like. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"We had heard so much about Dunwells that I guess our expectations were just too high. It was just OK. The food was no better and no worse than any other casual dining. Not a lot of imagination or care. The service is indifferent at best. The staff seems more intent on socializing with each other than taking care of customers."}
{"text":"Great food and service on a busy Friday night. Wait wasn't too long and it was well worth the wait. We ordered chicken tenders for our son, which are absolutely delicious- light but crisp breeding was perfect for our 20 month old. The mac-n-cheese burger was amazing! No ketchup needed! My husband's patty melt w/fries was so good he didn't offer me a bite! We went back for takeout that same weekend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and staff. Great food selection and always consistent. Largest selection of IPA's around and everything is always speedy."}
{"text":"i'm not sure what these people are talking about with regard to portion sizes, but you get 1/2 pound of chicken tenders with fries (lots of them) for 7$. i do agree that the pricing is a bit steep and the food is bar-food TYPE food... but it is done well. the food isn't greasy or cold as it is at the Hill... what was this other person thinking suggesting the hill is better?! been to the hill many times and the food is gross, greasy, and the restaurant is dark, dingy, and the service is slow, at best. not saying dunwellz is a slam dunk... but they will get my business again, for sure!"}
{"text":"Some of the best burgers around. The pub chips are too die for. Some of the sandwich combinations sound weird on paper, but try them. These people know how to put favors together to make the perfect bite. It is my to go place."}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been going to Dunwellz for over 3 years now (started when we were not married yet), and after all this time, we still love the food, people, staff and atmosphere.  Their wings, burgers and newer menu items are still wonderful, an we will continue to be loyal customers."}
{"text":"Didn't get to write this from about a week ago but here it is.  I went to Dunwellz and ordered some take out from the Parking Lot, then called in and asked Lisa if she would bring it to the car, because I have some mobility issues.  She did so gladly and when I went to leave, my car wouldn't start and it was 10 pm.  Lisa told me she would get help and ran back in!! Wow !  Within a minute, her Manager, Joe can out to help me trouble shoot the problem, after a few minutes he brought his own car over to jump start the battery and it worked!!  My hero!! Kind and very helpful.  I hope he and Lisa read this and know how much I appreciate them.  (Here's hoping I got the names right) PS the food was Delish!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great selection of craft beer! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"For my first visit, I was impressed. The food was good and the service was even better. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich & fries. The chicken breast was large and crispy with a nice kick. I got the medium sauce. Add cheese, lettuce, tomato & some blue cheese dressing and you've got a tasty chicken sandwich. The fries had great texture & flavor. My wife had the build your own burger that offers a ton of topping selections. She had the side of sweet potato tots. I wasn't a big fan of the tots. Kinda tasted like the frozen kind. Nice little craft beer selection on tap too and with great prices ($4.50 for a pint). I got the OMB Dunkel. Shout out to Jules for the great service!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Wings!!  Was there for the first time last week.  Staff very helpful and knowledge about menu.  I had a Reuben was very good just not a fan of the texas toast..next time i will get it on rye.  Definitely going back for the wings!!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of four for lunch Saturday. It's pub food but the pub food is very tasty. Three of us had tacos - shrimp, fish, and beef. All were very good and very filling. Beer selection is great."}
{"text":"This was one of the only places near my house that was open at 1045 on Saturday night. Tried it out on my first day here. I got the patty melt with pimento cheese and it was amazing. Will definitely be back to try more things.   One thing I didn't like was how loud the music was. It was blaring. They were playing like music trivia or something and our waitress had to scream at us. Otherwise I'd definitely like to try more menu items in the future."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Has a great variety of foods that are all great. Burgers are creative and delicious. Since moving to the Mint Hill area this has definitely been a favorite. Also has great drink specials, you can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"Friggin' spectacular donut burger. The sweet potato tots seemed of the frozen variety, but still decent with the cinnamon butter. Clean facility, friendly staff. Overall great experience. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Well, well, well! I had a co-worker that bragged about this place a few years ago. He talked like this place has the best wings in the world. After stopping by another spot and waiting way to long for a seat I walked out and decided to give this place a try. First when I walked in I immediately noticed that my party was the only African Americans in the building aside from two others so it does not seem very diverse. However, we decided to stay. And let's just say the food was okay but I am not sure what all the hype is about, yes my coworker was wrong! However, on a good note we had a really great server and she was cute. I believe her name was Alyssa. We had drinks, fries and wings. Being it was my child's birthday we also had a free desert and all of the food was pretty good just not the best. So after paying the bill with was right at $70 for 5 of us I noticed a big globe of something black in my glass. I asked the waiter about it and she went to get the manager. And get this to should there condolence for whatever was in my glass the manager offered me a coupon to get $5 off if I spent $30 on my next visit. Well let's just say in my opinion that was and insult and another visit most likely won't be happening at least no time soon."}
{"text":"Good wings. Very interesting burger selection...the doughnut burger is yummy. Great place to watch sports"}
{"text":"You have to get the notorious PIG. The best burger I've eaten in a long time. And the sweet potato tots with cinnamon butter. The service was great and they were willing to make accommodations for your needs. It's the only restaurant I've been to that when I asked for gluten free they asked if it was a preference or an allergy. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Too loud. Service is bad. Last time I was there the bartender was eating a plate of food with her bare hands in between serving drinks."}
{"text":"This could be a 4 based on the options in the area but if I am going to just give you a straight up opinion...it is a 3 all day long.  The place was quite lively on Friday night.  It was actually quite loud in there and you can get the whole sports/bar/grill vibe they are  going for.  Nonetheless we were seated right away and opted for the outdoor patio.  This was nice and casual and simple..exactly what we were looking for.  We started with their homemade chips and salsa.  The salsa was very fresh, we practically drank it!  We enjoyed it.  IT had somewhat of a beer flavor but when we asked if it had beer in it we were told no.  Maybe the chef was drinking on the job and accidentally dripped a little in our batch.  Regardless, it was very good and we had no problem woofing it down.  I went with the turkey burger and the husband got a regular burger.  Mine came with a sauce of choice and avocado, some other yummy stuff and on a gluten free bun.  All of the patties are made in house so that is good (except the veggie burger is frozen).  The sauces were somewhat  generic but not bad.  The sweet potato tots were everything they needed to be...greasy, sweet and more of a dessert than anything else!  They were quite good.    They weren't the best burgers we have had but again, there isn't much to compare it to in this area.  So in that regard Dunwellz stands out!  They offer specials throughout the week/weekend, music and other fun themes.  They have a fun, relaxed atmosphere so definitely worth a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"drink special every night.  not your typical food choices. the notorious P.I.G. is damn good, its a burger- pulled pork- bacon topped with onion straws. wings here too. decent choice of deserts and an outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Dunwellz is a relaxed family friendly place. We really like the wings and burgers. The staff is always nice and friendly."}
{"text":"The food was very good and there seems to be a lot of events that you can attend during the week like trivia. I was disappointed in the service as they were not busy at all and the waitstaff seemed to be taking a lunch break as well."}
{"text":"Food is passable for what they're trying to do. Service is ok. Seeing waitresses and hostesses talking on their phones, fixing their makeup, etc. while customers are waiting on service is unacceptable. Come here if you want fairly good food and a bunch of teenager/twenty-somethings to waste your time."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I've watched a few football games here and the environment and service is great.    They have good bar food on their menu and even include gluten free choices.  For the record their turkey is amazing.    This is a place I recommend for watching sporting events, or kicking back and having a drink in a very laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 big ones because everything was great! Took my buddy there on his birthday for lunch. Got there about 12:30 was fairly busy but no problem getting a table.  Owner greeted us and was on staff the whole time making all run smoothly.  Wait staff was friendly and hard working.  Started out with a bacon Bloody Mary and fried pickles.......both tasted great. I posted a picture that shows the bacon in the drink....oh yeah....I ate it. I got the meatloaf burger. I could have built my own from a large assortment of items on the menu, a great idea and I can't believe they keep this much stuff in stock. I'm talking all kind of breads, cheese, toppings etc. I decided to go with a salad for my side and was surprised when our waitress asked what kind of lettuce I would like.....wait...what? Awesome and fresh. Now I read some other reviews before I went in today and I have to disagree with the folks that said this food was just ok, it's way better than that. Staff is friendly and on point. Food is hot, fresh and delish. I will go again..........soon I hope"}
{"text":"Dunwellz reminds me of that episode of Southpark where they had a restaurant called Raisins ... it was ran by kids and all the customers were kids... it's sad that you try to enjoy your night out on a Friday at 12 at night and literally the whole place is filled with high school kids... I won't be stepping back in this place until they make some rules about allowing kids after hours... shame"}
{"text":"ok,  this place has great burgers!! The Jamaican jerk wings need massive work to get to flavor town. the Notorious P.I.G. Burger is the BOMB DIGGITY!!! Our server Mackenzie was awesome as well with her suggestions and promt attention she rendered throughout our visit! My wife had the mac-n -cheese chili burger and said it was awesome as well!! We will definitely come back here for more offerings off this menu!"}
{"text":"We went to Dunwellz today around 11 AM so granted it was a little early. We really enjoyed all of our food. I had that pimento patty melt on Texas toast. Really good! The hamburger was juicy and delicious with just the right balance of pimento and onion. My husband had the cheesesteak sandwich but it was more like pot roast. The sweet potato tots saved his meal though! Overall good service. We'll be back. As mentioned in other posts, 4 stars relative to mint hill but solid 3.5 in the grand scheme."}
{"text":"Wow tough crowd out here in ole Mint Hill...? I mean seriously folks, this place is new and working out its kinks. Not to mention, you've got very few options out here so I would've thought this place to be pretty popular.   Beer, Food, Games, Patio, Clean...  *scratches head*  Oh Well, It was a good find for me while staying close by so call me a Fan!  I ordered the Fish and Chips that were pretty dang good The fish meat was super tender white and juicy, the crust had a nice thin layer of crisp bread and the server knew that the dish goes well with Malt Vinegar.  While I can't vouch for all their food my fish and chips were grade A.  Peace."}
