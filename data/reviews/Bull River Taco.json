{"text":"To begin with I totally understand the reviews being all over the map in that some are four stars and others are one star.   I feel that, depending on the day, a person's mood, the quality, the size of Bull River's tacos, the price point, the location, and set up could easily sway anybody one way or the other.  This place is polarizing.  It is hard to categorize this taco stand because Bull River is brand new to the location and trying to develop its own identity, break into the South Hills market, and provide a decent product within a set price point while making financial ends meet.  I've been there three times and can tell that they have a LOT of potential but they are definitely learning and taking their lumps.

Here is my candid review:
The positives:  I found the taco stand to be set up really well given its extremely small space, I think their meat (and overall food) is definitely better than average in quality and they use fresh ingredients for the most part (which is absolutely key), they aren't pretending to be something they are not - they aren't authentic Mexican - they appear to be a SW American taco stand, their meat was fresh, juicy and well made in a pressure cooker,  their price point is in line with other taco stands in Pittsburgh, their employees are attentive, friendly, the stand is clearly very clean inside, they have solid flavors in their carnitas, very tasty taco toppings, complimentary sides, fantastic decorations and quick service.

The negatives:  No bathrooms (they aren't required because they do not have a seating area exactly like Las Palmas in Brookline), their tacos are not as big as their nearest competitors (though the quality of meat is better), the taste of the chicken isn't as flavorful as other stands (they need to kick up the spice in their chicken),  their guacamole is definitely NOT homemade, the stand is so small I watched as an employee used the floor to prepare chicken in a pressure cooker - he did a good job with it but he had to sit the cooker on the floor in front of customers,  they aren't using traditional, high quality Mexican corn tortillas (which I much prefer), they don't have a condiment bar (the taco toppings are already predetermined), they had some weird sauce they called \"bullseye\" sauce (they should dump it and go with something cleaner with less mayo and more spice - that'd be my first suggestion), they used prepackaged bagged tortilla chips, they could increase the size of their sides to meet the size of their nachos (which were not really that good), they need to empty their exterior garbage cans more often.

All in all, I found this place to be a good upstart southwestern taco stand.  They don't pretend to be something they aren't which wins HUGE points with me.  They are competing but need to make some significant changes to keep up with their competition. If they do so they will make it because their location is really fantastic.  I think 3 stars is spot on for now ... we will see how/if they progress or regress.  

Recommendation:  I will 100% go back but I realize YMMV."}
{"text":"Great little taco place! Flavorful tacos and can get in and out quickly for lunch!

I had the special of the day, the chicken chipotle taco and the spicy beef taco. Both tacos were good sized and filling. The sauces on each were the best features of the tacos. The beef had good seasoning on it. Veggies were fresh. Service was very quick and helpful. 

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Lived in the southwest for almost 8 years and I have to say the tacos at Bull River are better than any I had down there. I have my boss and coworkers addicted and we are there weekly. I'm especially grateful that these delicious tacos are gluten free! You must stop here and try."}
{"text":"I have to say when bull River first opened quite a few months back. My experience with the facility was wrong on all aspects of the spectrum. The food was not good the service was even worse. Nobody wore gloves the garbage cans were full and all of the employees that were there or very unfriendly. I reluctantly stopped a few days ago when a friend insisted that we ate there. I was so surprised with the service the food was a hundred percent better. Everything was clean the people personable the garbage cans were empty. The girls behind the counter were very friendly and accommodating. They took the time to explain what went on which tacos and had no problem altering ingredients to my personal preferences. All around I had total experience that I was so pleased with in the food was so good. I definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Bull River Tacos were flavorful and the perfect portion size for the money in my opinion! ($3 ea)

There isn't any seating in the restaurant just tables to stand if you want to eat your tacos there. I got the pork and chicken. Yum. Also saw them making nachos that looked good. It seemed like the employees were pretty young and more worried about their phones than our order which is why I can't give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Finally a taco stand in the area! The pork tacos are the best, although the chicken tacos are good; they were a bit spicy."}
{"text":"Love the food but not sure its worth the wait.  Spend 40\" waiting for 3 tacos a couple weeks ago.
Returned today with a large order put in ahead of us but got our 3 tacos in 15 minutes"}
{"text":"Amazing place for tacos! Definitely a must go! We ordered chicken and beef tacos, all were delicious at only $3/taco! Chips and salsa were also great!"}
{"text":"Really good tacos at a fair price. I think the pork tacos are especially good. Fast service. Not much room to eat, tho, so be ready to take them to go."}
{"text":"I stopped in on an impulse purchase. My first choice (pork taco) was not available yet so I purchased a chicken taco instead. The taco was served without guac contrary to the description on the menu. When I inquired, they told me that guac was no longer served. 

Taco was ok but not worth going out of your way."}
{"text":"Tacos are pretty good but not quite sure if they are worth the price.  The salsa on the other hand tastes like they just poured Ortega out of a bottle from Costco :P"}
{"text":"I never write reviews - but this place has the best tacos I've ever had.  It's a must try.  
We had GLUTEN FREE pork, beef and spicy pork tacos as well as corn loaded nachos.  Totally amazing."}
{"text":"The tacos are fine, but it always takes way too long for them to be prepared. Last night it took 15 minutes and there was only other customer in the store. I far prefer El Burro in Regent Square."}
{"text":"Pros: tasty, cheap / good value, some veg options

Delicious tacos for $3 and huge portions of deluxe nachos for $6. You can and will overestimate how much you can eat. So obviously a great value.

Cons: tiny storefront

It's super small and hardly has any table space (standing room only). I'd also like to see the place open a little longer. It currently closes at 8 but I can imagine myself being in the area and wanting to get some food here around 9 or 10."}
{"text":"The chicken and pork tacos were great. The stand-up tables were a little low and awkward, but it was a very satisfying lunch for less than $10 with a soda. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great tacos I had the pork and the special which was a brisket. They have cold mango jarritos too."}
{"text":"4/5 times we've been here our order has been messed up. Got pork when I ordered beef, got guac when I asked for none, got flour torillas when I asked for corn... Something Everytime. Bullseye sauce is ranch and tasted sour last time I was there. Fly's flying around everywhere. Really wanted to like this place but they need to figure some stuff out."}
{"text":"Had higher hopes. Went last year and had a good experience however today was not. Was told they were out of beans and offered a taco instead. Ordered 5 tacos. And upon picking up the order noticed we were charged for the beans and given what looked like a order of beans in the bag. Got home and noticed we only received 4 of the 5 tacos and had a half order of beans. The beans did not even incline the toppings, just plain old black beans. Needles to say the end result was an $8 over charge for NOTHING."}
{"text":"The portions are huge. I've tried the spicy beef tacos, chicken tacos and the salad so far. Food is consistently good and take out is quick."}
{"text":"Cute location. Not impressive food. Literally ordered one of each tacos and the nachos and they sucked. The chicken taco had a huge bone in it. Shitty"}
{"text":"The taco shell was way too small for $3.00, and the meat tasted a bit bland. Alright for a quick bite to eat, but not high quality."}
{"text":"The more I eat, the better it gets. I've had the nachos three times now with all different meats and I think chicken is by far my favorite. It's LOADED with meat, I even have leftover to share with my German Shepard. (A prize for her patiently watching me stuff my face ) Price is very cheap ($5.95), something this size would cost easily $8.95 at other places.
I've also tried all the tacos, and I think the beef taco in a flour tortilla togo's the best. The corn tortilla got a little soggy last time. Haven't had a chance to eat it there yet, but I can imagine if it taste this good an hour after I pick it up, how much better it would taste fresh in the store. Price for tacos sounds expensive at first ($3.00 each) but after you eat them, it's so filling and packed with meat, makes it totally worth it. 
There's always a line when I get there but it moves very quickly. Staff was very friendly and worked quickly to get everyone's order done right. Overall, great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Pretty happy we tried this place. We ordered the nachos to share and loved them. Meat was tender and they had just enough spice. Having a special with fish tacos and my only complaint was the slaw was good, but a ton was on there. Super crunchy and nice zing, just a little too much for my liking.
If you're looking for fresh ingredients and a solid meal, definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"The girls that work there are not very clean. The one was cooking my taco while blood was dripping down the back of her arm as the other girl wiped it with her shirt. Also, she went out to pet a dog in someone's truck while I was waiting to order. It was not a health friendly atmosphere, more like half a$!  I was so impressed by the look of the place until I noticed there were flies flying around the meat and they left the lid open.  The girl also wore one glove to prepare the food and the other one went into the bathroom with her purse to smoke a cigarette.  F for professionalism.  Tacos anyone???"}
{"text":"Spicy beef was delicious, chicken could've been better. They have tubs of cholula, both the green and red which is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch.  The tacos were pretty big and decently priced.  I wish they have more different flavors but overall it's solid."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Last visit: 
- Incorrect prices taped to glass next to register + on menu cards all over place ($3.25 vs. $3 listed)
- A/C broken (85 degrees) 
- Out of salsa
- Out of queso
- Out of loaded nachos (claimed out of boxes, when mentioned could put in another holder, claimed out of queso)
- Item ordered with guacamole came without any (later said they were out of guac)

Food was good, but WTF."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what a Taco place needs to be. Cheap, tasty, simple. The Spicy Beef Taco is my favourite."}
{"text":"The loaded nachos are delicious as well the red beans.  My husband enjoyed his chicken taco.  FYI there is no indoor seating.  It was raining when we went to bull river so we had a picnic in our vehicle.  We are definitely going back.  I want to try taco salad and veggie taco."}
{"text":"Every time I passed by this small hole in the wall of squirrel hill, it smelled soo good that I finally took the chance to try it out! First thing I noticed was that there are not enough seating, which is understandable in such a small space but I think that would be my only complaint about this place. Each taco is $3, which I thought was reasonable with the quality and how satisfied I felt after eating two tacos. I ordered the Spicy Beef taco ($3) and the special Jamaican Jerk Chicken taco ($3.50). The spicy beef taco comes in a white flour tortilla and the special taco came in a corn tortilla. I really enjoyed these tacos because of their sauce that they use, called bullseye sauce. I'm not sure what it's consisted of, but it's what makes these tacos set apart from regular tacos. We did stand the entire time while eating, but I don't think I minded because the food was so good haha. I saw their loaded nachos being made and was so tempted to order it as well but I'll save that for another time :)"}
{"text":"Elevator Review: Decent Tacos with a staff that doesn't seem to like people. 

When I saw that a taco place was opening on Murray Avenue I was really excited. This was exactly the area needed. 

The tacos are pretty good: I prefer the pork tacos, but I have enjoyed the fish tacos as well. The food is a bit salty overall. So be sure to get a drink or bring one. 

My big hang up is the staff. I feel like the staff is irritated with me being patronizing their restaurant. And I notice that they seem just as disinterested in the other patrons as well. I am not looking for a deep friendship while ordering tacos, but it seems like some of the employees are disdainful of the customers."}
{"text":"Small place and staff pretty friendly.   Ordered a Chipotle chicken taco (special), Vegan, and another chicken taco.  Overall, it wasn't that great.  More like college food - quick and inexpensive."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the tacos here after driving by this cute little stand so many times. Considering the location of the stand, I really wanted this place to be a hit. My husband and I are taco lovers but we were not impressed with Bull River Tacos. We ordered just about one of each and none of them stood out. The flavors of each were ok, but nothing out of this world. Rather lackluster to be honest. 

We noticed that another location is opening in Squirrel Hill so we may give it another shot at the new location."}
{"text":"Not bad tacos, but almost felt like I was just eating a slightly nicer version of Taco Bell. The meats and topping are uninspired. Maybe good for a quick bite on the go if you're passing by but don't go out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"Was so excited to see Bull Run open in Squirrel Hill. We walked down and ordered tacos for a group of friends. Got all the way home only to find out that we didn't have all the tacos we had ordered and paid for. Sort of sad, but the food was really good. We're going to give them another shot, I hope this time we get our full order."}
{"text":"I spotted this place and as a taco lover like the rest of America, I tried it out. I had the carnitas and beef tacos. The carnitas was pretty good, and the toppings went well with it. The beef taco honestly tasted like a taco bell beef taco, so you can take that as you will. I would try this place again - it seems like this place is fairly new in the area, so they can only improve, and the ingredients were fresh. They are also family owned, which is always a-ok in my book. Def worth a try!"}
{"text":"Love this place the look alone draws you in its so authentic and the connection you get with the food and the scenery are spot on. Now lets talk about the food, Ive had everything there the spicy beef the chicken the pork all super good and worth every penny. The loaded nachos will fill you up for days, they hook you up. Now for the customer service the two girls that work the morning shift not sure what there names are but its the blond and the brunette there probally in there 30's id say. But there love and passion for there job definately shows they are always smiling and treat you like you belong there not to mention how much the care and attention to detail of the product they serve. Those two alone are worth the trip but I can guarentee once you eat there youll be a repeat customer. Best Tacos In Pittsburgh And Customer Service. Hands Down."}
{"text":"Super tasty!!! Spicy, greasy, very American tacos. Looking for an authentic, hipster taco? Go somewhere else, you're not wanted here. Rustic and clean. Fast and cheap. Ron Swanson would love this place. Grew some hair on my chest after eating here. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Excellent tacos, friendly staff. Great price. Had the spicy beef and the pork. Pork is smoked next door."}
{"text":"Yummy tacos, generous portions, and the young man who served us was really friendly and sweet! Great humble little stand to stop off 51 for a good, decently priced bite to eat. The spicy beef and chicken tacos were delicious!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today with my mom and daughter. Its more of a food stand. There are a few standing tables so if you have a baby its not the best place to stay and eat. We pushed two tables together and sat my daughter (15 months old) on top. 
My mom got the loaded nachos and I got the chicken taco and pork taco. I actually liked the chicken taco better. I brought home a chicken and beef taco for my hubby and he liked the beef better. Next time I will try the beef.
When I come back it will be when its a bit warmer out since the place really isn't closed off to the cold air."}
{"text":"First trip, got a beef taco, pork taco, and loaded nachos. OMG, AWESOME. I preferred the flavor of the pork taco nest.

Second trip,  it's Lent, got 2 fish tacos and a veggie taco. Good, but the fish was bland. The veggie taco (heavy on brans) was surprisingly great!

Third trip just might happen . . . NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Delicious tacos -- got the buffalo chicken special, vegetarian taco and the chicken nachos. So delicious. Really cute space -- we really needed a quick bite, so we stood and ate inside before our road trip. The staff is incredibly friendly as well."}
{"text":"Great little spot, very interesting and unique tacos . Reasonably priced, creative... and wonderfully messy! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Just ate this place! It was good if I was you go pork taco with everything on it and make sure I REPEAT make sure get the loaded nachos with beef!!! The employees were kinda slow and dumb though but the food was great"}
{"text":"Stop, you are better off going to a bad Taco Bell.
As a traveler to the Southwest they don't have a clue to a good taco and for the price you will leave hungry or broke.  Not authentic at all"}
{"text":"Very delicious! Cute authentic taco stand if you're looking for somewhere quick and good to eat. Got the chicken and beef tacos and they were very flavorful with the different ingredients. The shells could've been cooked a little crispier. The outdoor seating is nice and relaxing and very casual. You can sit on the outside walls at the standing tables. However, with the amount of employees working, the garbage cans were overflowing and the tables could've been wiped clean after each customer. Overall great little place for quick yummy tacos! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quick grab-and-go taco place. Glad to see more Mexican food options in Squirrel Hill (there's also Cuzamil down the street which never seems busy despite being pretty good). Only problem is portions are fairly small with two tacos being the sizing equivalent of one of Cuzamil's (or anyone else's) taco. For a \"full meal\" I'd suggest about three tacos. Thankfully the quality is pretty good, my only gripe is the service size and the tortillas do tend to get a bit soggy"}
{"text":"I would like to review properly but since I didn't actually get to eat my taco, I will say this much. The smell drew me in. It's tiny, no seating, just a couple of standing tables, crowded quickly with 6 people waiting for their food. For a quick to go, the prices were low and I was excited to have something different around Squirrel Hill to try. Luckily I wasn't starving as half way back to work, I opened the box to find my taco smothered in a white spicy smelling sauce. (I did not notice it on the menu while there, so I looked it up and called to ask about the ingredients...) I am allergic to dairy, so I will be more careful next time and I am not a fan of a lot of sauces in any case. I did tell them no cheese, and did see sour cream on other menu items but not this one, so I felt I covered my bases. Hopefully my coworker enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Taco's really are really average but it's almost impossible to find a taco shop in the city so it's passable. Service is pretty terrible. Messed up multiple aspects of my order last time."}
{"text":"Why not 5 stars you may ask... Not enough eat-in space. No seats.
Food, however, is amazing!! We ordered 2 chicken tacos and a beef taco salad. Both needed no additional toppings or sauce. Certainly, if you like more heat, there are several options.
Prices were weird though. Menu prices and cash register prices weren't the same. They kept true to the register price and did not offer a refund. Not a huge difference, but should really be the same.
Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall taco place! Convenient location for a quick place for tasty food! Got the chicken taco and it was phenomenal"}
{"text":"Chicken tacos were great! Really enjoyed the rice - it looks like it's not a regular item but would love if it were! Also very, very affordable."}
{"text":"Ignore the fake news -- this place is top notch on the quality/price scale 
Tasty tacos + bomb nachos.  Portion size galore. 
My girlfriend and I prefer the pork.
Not a good sit down location (literally, no chairs) but definitely serves the purpose of grabbing something while walking around in squirrel hill or on a lunch break if you are around.
Would frequent if a squirrel hill resident."}
{"text":"Wonderful halibut tacos. Just wish the place had seating,  however it probably wouldn't be as inexpensive."}
{"text":"Finally made the short trip to Bull River Taco to try some goodies this week! I went with a chicken taco and the chicken salad, with bulls eye sauce on the side, in addition to the sour cream. For $3.25 a taco, and under $6 for a salad, this was a heck of a lot of food! My boyfriend ate the taco and really liked it. I LOVED my salad. Tasty chicken, lots of romane, pico, crushed up tortilla chips, and the bulls eye sauce was delicious on top. I really enjoyed my meal and am excited to go back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I live right down the road from this, and I saw the reviews for this place and just knew I had to try it! Their food is amazing!!! We had the nachos & two tacos, they are to die for!!! I'm rating it 4 stars because even though it is good, they are a little too high priced."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why all those bad reviews! A lot of places don't have chairs to set ! I actually liked the idea! The food is so good an the portions are really good for the price! I ordered the nachos with beef and oh my it's huge and delicious! I also had chicken tacos and smoked brisket tacos and both were great as well. The staff were friendly and good. I would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Nice little, quick pick-up taco place. We tried the chicken and spicy beef and both were amazing! Very well priced also!"}
{"text":"Very solid tacos here and super quick and easy! I hadn't even realized this new taco place had popped up until I was headed for waffles next door and saw the sign outside. 

Decided to pop in and try a few tacos. Went for spicy beef and chicken to start, although it appears they have a special/feature taco each day (happened to be buffalo chicken that day). The transaction was easy and friendly and I snagged a spot at a standing table to wait for the order. The tacos came out pretty quickly and I got to work trying their several hot sauce offerings on the tacos! 

Depending on how well business is, I could see them maybe needing to expand to include seating or more standing tables. In any case, the ingredients were fresh and the tacos were well portioned. Hot sauce was fun to try :) will definitely be back to try more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Not very good. I would rather make the drive to Brookline to have las palmas tacos (if you haven't some of the best!)"}
{"text":"Keeping it simple and basic comes to mind when I think of the food at Bull River taco. Basic tacos, no frills. Super small selection/menu, only about 4 different tacos to choose from.  
The loaded nachos were quite HUGE! The nachos could of been a whole meal by itself. 
Bull River is extremely small with just 2 tables that you must stand at. So if you get there and there's already someone eating at the tables then you have no where to eat. 
I wasn't overly impressed with the food at Bull River. It's definitely not bad but yet nothing special. The flavor of the tacos were pretty basic. And because the menu is so small it doesn't give you much of a reason to keep coming back to try other items."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped by on a whim. I ordered the pork taco and she ordered the spicy beef taco. They we made to order and we had them within five minutes. They were served piping hot. Large lime wedges were on the side. The taco were delicious and way beyond our expectations. I am looking forward to going back or trying their other locations. My friend summed up this experience as good truck food in a permanent location."}
{"text":"I had been eyeing this place some time before it opened. I LOVE the stand and how cute it is. It is literally 5 minutes from house so that is a bonus for our family. The food is pretty decent. I have tried every taco on their menu I believe. I really want this business to succeed and stay open for the long run! I like that their menu is small and simple. The customer service is good. It has been a tad slow for a taco stand but those times were when they just opened and are probably trying to get in the groove and figure things out still."}
{"text":"I got 3 tacos, chicken, beef and pork. Beef was decent. I threw away the other two. This was the worst taco experience I've had in Pittsburgh. Everything tastes cheaply made, everything is drenched in a sauce that is not good, smothered in a pound of tomatoes, and lacks flavor. It's great for 'fast' and cheap, but I can get the same price at Condado... and actually enjoy the food. Needs a major repair

I'd definitely also like to add that the staff wasn't very friendly. No greeting, not welcoming, just quiet."}
{"text":"Having lived in Texas for many years, I had my doubts about a northern taco place. While this restaurant was more hipster than authentic, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and portions.

My only complaints are that the hot sauce selection was lackluster, the salsa had a bit too much cumin flavor, and the staff did not know how to pronounce Jarrito. These negatives are forgivable, however."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the tastiest tacos I've ever had (and I eat a lot of Mexican food)! When I ordered and saw it was $3 for a small taco, I wasn't all that impressed... until I tasted them. WOW. Just, WOW. Each ingredient was unique, all the flavors stand out on their own but blend together so well. I went with the vegetarian tacos. The black beans were soft but still held their shape and were very flavorful. The farmers cheese was mild but held its own. The soft tortillas (they use two and gently heat them on the grill) are the best I've ever eaten. I'm not a bread kinda person but I left my visit craving more of those delicious soft tortillas! BY FAR, though, the BEST part is the Bullseye sauce. They need to just call it crack, it's honestly that addictive. On my second trip there I ordered the vegetarian salad with a side of Bullseye sauce as dressing. They were a bit heavy handed with the tortilla chips (ask for less chips if you aren't a fan), but generous with all the other toppings. Be sure to try the jalapenos, even if you don't like spicy food. They are pickled and are more sweet then spicy, a very pleasant surprise. Seriously, though, what they lack in volume they more than make up for in flavor. Run, don't walk, to Bull River Tacos."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos! Nachos would've been better if they'd actually filled the container. The meat was awesome (had chicken, pork, and beef) and the toppings were not overtaking the whole taco. Tacos did get soggy in the car ride home but that's to be expected. They still held together well enough to eat! The sauces were so tasty and complemented the meat well. I'll try them again after they've had some time to settle in- you'll gain a star just for adding more nachos to your nachos!"}
{"text":"This little taco place on the side of the highway is amazing. It's a great place to grab a quick lunch, and the tacos are delicious and extremely affordable. They offer vegetarian options and Mexican sodas. There are a few tables outside stand at and enjoy your meal, but most people take it to go. I only wish they served margaritas too!"}
{"text":"I really was hoping this was going to be good, but unfortunately the tacos were terrible. It was frozen beef with store bought taco mix that left a terrible taste in my mouth. I bought three tacos and could only stomach eating 2 of them. This is not even close to a Mexican Street Style Taco Stand. They need to go to Edgar's Taco Shack and learn what a traditional taco stand is. I gave them two stars out of kindness. Editing the review to reflect a one star now since the owner decided to message me to edit my review. They use GFS frozen pulled pork and beef in their tacos. We literally saw the packages in the window."}
{"text":"I have now had everything on their menu.  It is tough for me to decide what to get each time I go because of how good everything is.  From the chips and guac to the nachos, and of course the amazing tacos.

I would say my favorites are the spicy beef and the chicken taco.  I order all of my tacos on the flour shells here.  It seems to hold up to the toppings better and I am just not a fan of corn shells in general.  

$3 each for tacos that are filling and flavorful is more than worth it to me.  I am full after two of the tacos and am happy to spend $6 for two filling and fresh tacos."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on a Sunday at 730, so I can understand if the food was not going to be as \"fresh\" as expected. This in my opinion is not an excuse to serve less than delish food. Anyway, we were actually going to Spilly's, but they closed at 7pm and noticed the Bull River was still open. We had noticed it in the past when going to Spilly's. So we decided to give it a try, not to mention we were starving. We ordered 2 beef (brisket) and 2 chicken; we should have ordered only 1 of each. At first site theses tacos were loaded with so much meat. Imagine the filling of a chipotle burrito was all meat. Take 3/4 of that meat and add it to a taco. Totally unnecessary. We weren't even sure how to eat them. I ended up using a spoon to eat some of the meat before approaching it like any normal taco eating person. My boyfriend picked his up and soon realized it was a mistake and proceeded to walk and then stood in the parking lot with a trail of meat and toppings following him like a taco version of Hansel and Gretal. I'm not sure if this is to make up for lack luster ingredients and flavor. We went ahead and ate them there, considering how huge they were. The toppings were nothing to go to town about. The beef was dry and chewy; the chicken bland. Thank god for the hot sauces that provided much needed punch into flavortown. After living in Denver and DC, both of which have large populations of Latinos and people of Mexican heritage and having had my fair share of \"street\" tacos, this was truly disappointing. Why sooooo much meat...please take your time cooking the food and make fresh ingredients. You can't just slap food in a tortilla and call it tacos. Not sure we'll be back after one experience. *both my boyfriend and I woke up at 3 in the morning with stomachaches too. This was the only place/thing we at that evening."}
{"text":"I expected a lot more for the money that I paid. The tacos or just OK. They come as you get them, and there are no condiments to be added. The loaded nachos were expensive and made with cheap canned cheese and very little meat. To say that I was disappointed would be an understatement."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I each got three beef tacos that were stuffed and the loaded nachos. Everything was quite delicious! A tad pricey but these are not Taco Bell tacos. You get what you pay for. Great place for a quick, tasty meal."}
{"text":"How tacos should taste! Fresh ingredients including  cojita cheese, cilantro, and lime. Good bang for your buck for only $3.00! Very filling!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so badly. It's not a chain. It's nearby. It's tacos!

But...it's awful. 

I got about half of their tacos to give them a fair trial. First, the chicken. The only thing I could taste is lime. Second, the pork. Fine, but so much liquid. Sopping wet. Third, the spicy beef. Salt. Salt. Salt. Salt. I could barely eat it and I don't mind salt. The beef tasted like run of the mill taco seasoning. It was topped with jarred jalapeños. All of these tacos were topped with the same sort of crema. 

I often judge Mexican food by taco and salsa, so I got chips, salsa, and quac. Chips were stale. The guacamole tasted like it had been squeezed out of a bag and the salsa as though it had come \"fresh\" out of a gallon jar. 

So disappointing. 

The upside? It isn't expensive. But neither is Taco Bell."}
{"text":"We were on our way to get a slice of pizza down the street, but stumbled upon this new taco joint so we decided to order 1 taco each as an appetizer. The worker was welcoming and even let our dog inside. Not only that, he gave him a bowl of meat to eat while we ate our tacos :)! So nice!!

We ordered 2 fish tacos which were AMAZING. I'm used to fish tacos with whole fish filets, not \"pulled fish\". It was so different, but a flavor I'll never forget. The tacos are HUGE so keep that in mind when ordering.

The only downside is that their are no seats here. There are two communal tables and that's about it."}
{"text":"I just had a very unusual experience here! Walked in and they have two huge tables and no chairs so you are kinda forced to have awkward conversations with strangers standing there too. It smells very strongly of meat and spices. It was not a very pleasant smell for me, but it's hard to help that in a small space like that. The two people working there were very rude.. the girl seemed like the last thing in the world she wanted to do was talk to me and the guy who made my taco was on his phone the entire time he cooked it and afterwards! 

They only had one vegetarian option and a very small menu. My major problem was the fact that their \"bull river sauce\" was blatantly ranch. I really don't like ranch and I didn't expect that at all. I had to eat it standing up with strangers next to me staring at me!! Don't see a reason to return."}
{"text":"Great for a quick grab and go meal. Restaurant quality for a decent price. The place is  definitely unique for the area. It is pretty basic set up but it has been maximized for what it is. The menu is pretty limited to tacos. Hence the name Bull River Tacos. They have a few tables to stand at if you want to eat there but I prefer to take the food with me. The tables will work good for someone that might be passing by or out on a quick lunch break. It's a perfect place for one of those nights that you want a quick and easy meal without the hassle or time to prep it. I think the price is fair for what you get. At the time of this review tacos are priced around $3.25. This price is very good for the quality of the product. Too many people are under the impression that all tacos should fall under fast food taco store prices. You are paying for quality ingredients here. The other day I bought 8 tacos and 2 loaded nachos for around $42. I was able to feed 3 adults and 5 young kids. The service is fast and the quality is always on. The staff is friendly and I have had a few conversations with owner while waiting for my order to be complete. The owner appreciates the patrons and always says thank you. More businesses should follow this model."}
{"text":"It is where Waffallonia used to be.  Bull River Taco moved into this small store after Waffallonia moved one store down (where an insurance company used to be).  Always wanted to try, though to be honest, I do not know much about Mexican dish.

The only other Taco place I know is the \"best taco on campus\" in Oakland. if you are from Pitt, you know what i am talking about.  Pricewise, Oakland is $2.5/taco, here is $3. But this is Squirrel Hill, so i think the price is fair. 

Foodwise, I had the chicken and spicy beef tacos.  ** I was confused about the # of tortillas in each of them before and they private messaged me about the numbers. \"So corn tortillas (chicken, pork, veggie), we use two. When it is a flour tortilla (beef/spicy beef), it is only one due to the thickness.\" **

One thing I like the most is the fact that the two tacos tasted very different.  It's not like they change the meat but give you the same sauce. The chicken goes with a guacamole (which i did not taste it), coleslaw and bullseye sauce.  The chicken was soft and almost like pulled-chicken. 

The spicy beef taco comes with a pico de gallo and jalapenos. The jalapenos were just right to give the kick but not too hot. (I am not a super spicy person)

There was only 1 person in the line, so i cannot comment on how they do under the heat.  Good to have something new to the area.  
(Diner area is standing only, good for quick lunch / quick dinner / snack.  But no alcohol drinks.)"}
{"text":"As the others mentioned, Bull River Taco has been a long-awaited update to the Murray Ave. restaurant repertoire. One of the endearing but slightly frustrating aspects of Squirrel Hill restaurants is that while we have great variety of food available, there is a lack of quick take-out options for people on the go. This little place is a promising remedy. 

I tried the chicken and veggie tacos with my sisters a couple nights ago. I stopped in on my way home from work, and was in and out in about 10 minutes. The staff were friendly, and they worked quickly. The store was out of nachos, which was one of the items I had hoped to try, so no word on those yet. We thought the ingredients tasted fresh, and the seasoning on the shredded chicken was balanced and well done. I also appreciated the use of corn tacos and real queso cheese -- something I grew to enjoy while living in California and which has been difficult to find on the East Coast. 

All in all, this is a great place to grab a quick, reasonably-priced lunch or dinner with a much more authentic and satisfying taste than larger taco chains. I hope this new restaurant is successful, as I will most certainly want to go back!"}
{"text":"Buyer Beware!! 
Really wanted to like this quaint looking taco stand on the side of 51. As there are very few good options to eat in this area. 
Ordered two tacos & the nachos. 
When the nachos were opened they looked delicious!! 
Unfortunately, the Canned Nacho Cheese & Beef were cold. Now being that this take-out only. I did eat my meal at the standing only tables outside, so time from kitchen to my belly may have been two minutes. 
Also wifey & I order the a pork & chicken taco. The corn tortillas were not cooked, as they were crumbling in my hand. (First sign, corn tortillas aren't cooked). Also there was a very sparse amount of meat. I wish I took a picture to show everyone the tablespoon of chicken & pork on each taco. 
Anyway, the reason I won't be back is the high schooler who was working the register. 
I asked the kid after trying my nachos, \"is the nacho cheese suppose to be cold?\" 
High schooler \"yes\"

Me, \"are you sure nacho cheese is suppose to be cold? Maybe you could warm some up for me?\"

High schooler \"it will take about 20 mins\"

Me,(getting irritated because wifey & I are starving) \"well can you refund me the money for the nachos, because they are kinda gross with cold nacho cheese\" 

High schooler, \" I don't know how to do that since you paid with a card\" 

Me, walked away in disgust with my cold nachos to never to return

PS this was around noon on a Sunday and both garbage were filled to the brim with trash, seems to be pretty odd considering they have only been open about an hour and fifteen minutes. Makes you wonder how often they empty their trash cans. 

Gets an extra star for a good design"}
{"text":"We had spicy beef,pork,chicken and beef tacos along with nachos...all fresh and super yummy !"}
{"text":"Tried the beef taco. It's all soft tacos with chopped tomatoes, onion, etc..covered in a tangy sauce, I added some bottled hot sauce available on the tables.
For Pittsburgh this is a fairly good deal for the price. It's not tacos from a city that have a higher Hispanic community but I don't think you'll be too disappointed."}
{"text":"This Bull River Taco location is at least as good as the one in the South Hills!

It's a great little joint, occupying the former storefront of Waffallonia. We've been waiting a long time for it to open and it finally is!

The spicy beef and chicken tacos are both excellent. The pork is also excellent. All tacos are three dollars and on fresh tasting tortillas. 

All in all a great addition to the Squirrel Hill scene!"}
{"text":"Cheap, tacos that don't taste cheap! Pork tacos are my favorite, and they don't cease to amaze. I always need to get takeout though, since their \"seating\" is basically just a couple of standing bars with no stools.

All in all, I never expected to be wowed by $3 tacos, but I was :)"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely wonderful. It makes me look for excuses to go upstreet. I wish they'd have barstools for those who choose to eat there, though, at their two counters. You have to stand and wait, then stand and eat. But the food is amazing. I will return. And return. And return."}
{"text":"Location: Great foot traffic location @ Murray/Forbes. Chic and clean. Standing room only w/ 2 tables.

Service: Was not a can-do vibe and didn't sense positive vibes to customers. Man was on a phone call with one hand and crafting my taco with another. Also, called a customer sweetheart which is borderline.

Food: Tacos are $3. Good serving of food and variety in each choice. Fresh ingredients and crunchy veggies. Aroma of seasoned beef added to a good eat.

All in all I recommend if you don't want to walk to Cuzamil on Murray."}
{"text":"Boring! Ordered 2 different tacos all tasted of the same seasoning. It reminded me of 1980's non culinary boring tacos! Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Beef tacos, excellent crispy shells, fresh toppings, plus guacamole. What's not to love. It's crowded. Call ahead to cut wait time."}
{"text":"** Flavorful tacos but a bit on the saltier side with a few simple options on the menu. Not super cheap (~$3 each), so good place to stop by for a snack but maybe not for a full meal. 

I ordered two tacos - the beef taco and the chicken taco, both without cheese or their sauce (not typically a huge fan of sour cream), so these tacos might be a bit different than how it tastes normally. I am a huge fan of guac, so I really like how it is already included in the tacos.

The beef taco was flavorful and the ingredients mixed well together nicely. The only thing I have to say was that the taco tasted a bit salty. The tortillas were also a bit more crispy and firm, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I think personally prefer soft shell corn tacos. I'd definitely recommend the beef taco over the chicken since the chicken seemed to be lacking in flavor.

Not too much table space (two tables) in the restaurant, so not good for big groups... and only standing space.

Also conveniently located right next to Waffallonia for a good snack afterwards!"}
{"text":"I spotted Bull River Taco Co and as a taco addict, I knew I had to stop and check out it since there aren't many taco joints in the area. I thought the tacos were decent. We tried the pork, chicken, spicy beef and an order of the black beans. The Spicy Beef Taco was delicous and had the right amount of spice, smothered in jalapeños. The Chiken Taco was kind of bland but thoroughly covered in the cholula sauce. The Pork Taco was tasty and the cabbage sprinkled on added a nice extra texture. I wouldn't order the black beans again, they were just ok. 

4 tacos, a side of black beans and two Jarritos came to about $21. If I was really in the mood for a taco and in the area I would go again, but if I'm looking for authentic street tacos I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a great no-nonsense taco joint for quick eats.  The prices are reasonable and the tacos are amazing. The ingredients are always fresh and the composition of the different tacos are very well crafted. If you have chipotle fatigue like many of us, this place will seem like a breathe of fresh air.

The shop itself is pretty much brand new with great fixtures and fun design choices too.

I suggest the pork tacos!"}
{"text":"Just ate here. It's a taco alright. But noting amazing about a plain old miniature taco being charged for $3. I can make the same taco at home... isn't the point of eating out to eat something better than your average food at home? 

the menu is sad. The food is sad. I was really excited and had high hopes for this place. Very disappointed. Maybe if the tacos were $1 (max. $2) I could justify stopping to grab a couple. Better off finding a Taco Bell."}
{"text":"These tacos are very good! However, keep in mind this is sort of like a gourmet fast food taco. There is no where to sit- and tacos get soggy on the go. So be prepared to eat in your car. There is a reason they do not have seating- so please do not base your review off of that. The decor is so cute and I love the idea of the place.

The ingredients were good and fresh. They seemed high quality to me. My chicken taco was SO SPICY. I do wish I knew this beforehand. I literally couldn't finish the small taco because my mouth was on fire. The coleslaw on it was a really nice touch. I think $3 for a gourmet taco is a very fair price. 

UPDATE: already came back and they changed their chicken! No longer super spicy!! I really appreciate a place that listens to their customers :)
The vegetarian taco is also delicious! The beans are cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"I had driven by and was so intrigued by the cute tile and decorations that I dragged my boyfriend back with me to try some tacos! We ordered one of each taco and chips and salsa. The chips are not worth it- taste like a costco bag of corn chips. Salsa is okay. The chicken taco had the best flavor, the pulled pork was a bit flavorless and the beef was the least favorite.. typically beef are my favorite!  Overall flavors are a bit bland. Still a cute location though. I'm not sure if I'd go back when Las Palmas is up the street from me."}
{"text":"If you like tacos from ingredients bought at Sam's club, then this is your place. Little to nothing is made fresh. Total bummer, as the place looks really cool, has a good looking menu, but seriously some lousy food. Liquid nacho cheese from a can, check. Salsa from a gallon tub, check. Jalapeños from a gallon tub, check. Color tortilla chips from Sam's club, check. Totally disappointed. Save yourself a few bucks and go to Giant Eagle and get an El Paso taco kit, that's pretty much what you are getting here anyways."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped here for a quick and impromptu dinner before we saw a movie at the manor theatre. The inside is very small, no chairs, just two high tables and a window seat, but it works perfectly because you can grab a taco and eat while you stroll Murray Avenue. The folks behind the counter were friendly and attentive, and our tacos were ready in under ten minutes. We tried a chicken, a pork, and a veggie taco. I liked that each taco had different toppings, not just the same toppings with your choice of meat. The chicken was my favorite; it was very juicy, and I think it was only dark meat. It had a Mexican slaw on top, along with their special sauce, and it was very flavorful and added a nice crunch. The pork taco was a bit dry but there was plenty of pico on top to give it some juice. My mom really enjoyed her veggie taco (I didn't get much detail, she was too busy chewing). We shared a mango soda and a bottle of water, and were on our way in time to get good seats at the movie. I hear they have a location on route 51 as well - I'll be sure to stop by on my next trip to South Park."}
{"text":"Very nice little in expensive place to grab a quick bite. They have about 6 tacos on the menu. My favorites are the pulled pork and vegi. Good serve. I never have to wait long."}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum!  Run, don't walk, to eat here!  We ate lunch here today and it will definitely become a Go To for us. We tried a variety of food and loved it all. I ordered the pork Taco, black beans, and then shared Loaded Nachos with the hubby. 
The pork on the Taco was soft and juicy. They give you fresh lime to squeeze over your tacos. Since I am a No Heat Freak I chose the Cholula Cream over the Bulls Eye Sauce. It's like sour cream. The Taco also had guacamole, cilantro, pico de gallo and lime. It is encased in two corn tortillas.  The black beans are my favorite!! They are topped with pico, cholula cream, farmers cheese and lime. I will order these every time.  
The nachos that I shared with the hubby were fresh tri colored nacho chips with ground beef, nacho cheese, pico, jalapeños, cholula cream, cilantro and lime. The chips stayed crispy which made them easier to eat. I squeezed some of my lime over the nachos and it was perfect for brightening them. 
The hubby had the Spicy Beef Taco. It has pico, Bulkseye sauce, jalapeños, farmers cheese, cilantro, and lime. It was encased in a flour Taco shell. My hubby loved it. 
For vegetarians they have a vegetarian Taco.  Something for everyone. There are no tables so I recommend BYOC-Bring Your Own Chair. Hang out and enjoy your food. You're going to love it."}
{"text":"Been anticipating the opening since I saw the sign go up a while ago. Finally had the chance to stop in today at lunch time. 

The food was quite good. I got 3 tacos, one chicken, one pork and one spicy beef. The chicken and pork (pictured) came on double corn tortillas the beef was on single flour. The two on corn were somewhat indistinguishable from each other but very good. I thought they were a very good rendition of a street taco. The beef was also good but a little more Americanized. 

The nachos which I didn't try looked very good (and too
much for one person), I may try them on a future visit when I'm not alone. 

The atmosphere is okay for this type of place. No seating but tables to eat (standing). They were a bit short for me (I'm 6'2\") but I like the concept. It's hard to get a food truck positioned well in the neighborhood so this is a great compromise. 

For me I thought the price of $3 per taco was a little steep. That's one of the reasons I'm giving it 4 stars. Meanwhile the nachos are only around $6. 

All in all I like this place and I think it's what I've been looking for in Squirrel Hill. I'll be back to cute my street taco cravings."}
{"text":"Decades ago Taco Bell was walk up only with some outdoor tables and a big gas fire blazing in the center of the patio. Bull River Taco reminds of those care free days. It is right off Rt 51 with a covered area enclosed by railroad ties.  There is no place to eat so everything is to go. I tried a pork taco and a spicy beef taco. My favorite was the pork possibly because it is shredded while the beef is ground. The tortillas are also very good.  My drive time back to my house was about 20 minutes. The tacos were still hot and the tortillas still intact. At $3 each, this made for an inexpensive & delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Not sure where the bad reviews are from.  Only has 2 small \"standing room only \" tables but overall the tacos are great and the price is fair. Beats some of the other higher rated taco joints.

I had the pork and the spicy beef btw."}
{"text":"Super tiny - almost a literal hole in the wall (I think this used to be the location of Waffelonia). This is definitely a place where you takeaway, not much space to stand and eat. 
I ordered a few tacos. There was only one couple ahead of me waiting for an order. It took over 10 minutes to get my tacos.
The tacos themselves were fine. Plain ground beef -- pretty generic, but pretty good. I'd have to go back to try some of the more innovative tacos. 
The biggest plus was the price--cheap eats for sure!"}
{"text":"A small taco shop located in squirrel hill. There are two tables without seats for eating and a small bench for 2-3 people to sit and wait, however most stand to wait. There is absolutely no reason to call ahead for your order, every time you order ahead, the food is never ready when you arrive. I've been to this location 4 times and each time I've waited more than 30 minutes for basic tacos. The wait is not worth it, as the tacos are soggy, tough meat and lacking flavor. Forget about ordering nachos to go unless you enjoy eating soggy flavorless stale chips. I do not recommend this location."}
{"text":"I went to Bull River taco for the first time today and it was absolutely delicious!! ordered one beef taco and loaded nachos to share with my husband and it was plenty of food! There is a little bit of room to stand and eat outside but we chose to just eat in our car which was fine since it was a little chilly out."}
{"text":"Inexpensive. Quick. Reminds me a food truck but in a permanent space.

I had the loaded chicken nachos and my husband got chicken tacos and both were INCREDIBLE. 

Great for a quick lunch or to get on the go and way better than drive thru.

One of the best Mexican meals I've had."}
{"text":"while the taste  of the food is above par, the meat portions in the tacos are anemic. a small mcdonalds burger patty contains more meat. at $3.00 a taco i would think you would get 1/8 of a pound of meat. it is no bargain. order twice the number of tacos you would normally eat or go away hungry. the loaded nachos with tortilla chips with the topping only on the surface. great if you want to just eat dry tortilla chips after you eat the top chips. all in all a bad deal for the price. tastes are great but cost is way out of line. the first time I ate there the tacos were $3.50 with slightly more meat, now at $3.00 the meat is barely there."}
{"text":"This is a small taco shop very close to the corner of Murray and Forbes. 

The shop itself is quite small with standing tables to eat food. It was also super hot inside the place. I know this place is new so they're figuring some kinks out but ordering/waiting for food takes awhile. 

We got the pork, spicy beef, and chicken tacos, as well as the beef nachos. The tacos were super good, we just wished there was more filling in the tacos, especially because they are $3 each. The nachos were sooooo good, especially the queso they put on them. I feel like the nachos are more worth the price (~$6) because you get a lot of everything. We also wished they weren't canned jalapeños but overall the flavors of everything were great!"}
{"text":"Nice little taco stand with $3 tacos.
A friend recommended and said there is another in Greensburg.
Ordered 2 tacos.  The Pork that pico de gallo, bullsege sauce, farmers cheese and topped with fresh cilantro that was suppose to be on a corn tortilla but was on a flour tortilla.  A lime come with the taco.  The taco was good and the meat tasty but it probably had a little to much sauce making it very sloppy and taking away some the the taste of the meat.  The spicy beef taco comes on a flour tortilla with pico de gallo, bullsege sauce, jalapeños, farmers cheese and topped with fresh cilantro.  Enjoyed the taste but again probably a tad to much sauce.  
We also ordered the loaded nachos to split and it is a meal in itself."}
{"text":"Have been driving by this place for a couple months and finally stopped. Well worth it for a quick bite and great taco. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I like this place. It is what it is. Cheap enough to forgive some if the quirks. Not really \"authentic\" but closer to Western taquerias than Tako. 

2 areas to improve: Have a spicy/hot salsa option or add more heat to the tacos. Have a water cooler or water dispenser."}
{"text":"This place is the s#%* !!!

Cool ambiance, cool people working, great tasting food! 

Quality of the food is amazing, and very generous portions. I also love the feel of the actual restaurant. Casual/cool, no chairs - in and out type of place. 

You need to check this place out!"}
{"text":"I love there nachos and tacos. Huge portions and tasty too. It's definitely worth the indigestion (nothing a few Tums can't remedy). It's such a cute place too. If you dine-in you'll likely find yourself sitting on a wall so order and take it home like a civilized person. That's what I do."}
{"text":"best tacos .... we got the chicken and pork and a chicken nacho . they were ridiculous ... reminded me of California  the tacos on the beach and late at night the stands on the corner . and the prices are crazy ... considering how cheap they are $3 for tacos and $5 for nachos i have no idea how they're making a profit. seriously but while we were waiting for our order they had a line out the door. seriously the best tacos!!!!"}
{"text":"Bull river taco catered my daughters cinco de mayo 1st bday party.  The food was awesome!!  We received so many positive compliments from our 70+ guests.  We chose the pork and chicken taco bar with flour and corn tortillas along with beans and all the taco fixings you could need.  Everything was sooo fresh and delicious.  The sauces, slaw and salsas included were very good and went great with everything.  Ordering and pickup was very smooth.  The owner was very attentive and responsive to our needs / questions.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I really wish Yelp would change their rating system. I think this place was slightly better than a 3 but not a 4.
I got the chicken, beef, spicy beef, and pork.
They were all pretty good, had some nice toppings on all them. Not the best tacos I have had but they were good. I would go back again, but would not go out of my way. 
I do think 6 tacos for almost $20 is kind of pricey. I get this isn't taco bell, but it would be nice to see a deal if you buy more than a couple."}
{"text":"Bull River Taco is a really cute taco stand on Rt. 51.  I actually went twice the other day - once for myself and my daughters and a couple hours later to take my sister. Everyone enjoyed the tacos - and they are nicely priced at $3 each.

I had the pork and chicken tacos - both delicious and and seasoned brightly. I love the fresh cilantro. My girls had the beef tacos and both loved them.  We also had the chips and salsa, which I would not rate that highly. The salsa tasted like it came from a jar, and the tacos were quit visibly from a bag. I yearn for some fresh salsa at the very least, but fresh salsa and freshly made chips would knock my review up. Still, a nice place to stop for a taco."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more. The staff were really friendly, but couldn't handle a lot of orders at once. Staff were getting a bit confused at which orders were completed already, but were very accommodating for this though. The 3 star rating is really for the taste of the tacos. We got 3 spicy beef and 3 pork tacos. Tacos are $3 each. They were very average tasting tacos and didn't taste as fresh. The nachos on the other hand are huge and less than $6! The nachos were by far the best thing."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile because it looks so cute and unique for the area.  I grew up nearby but have lived in Philly for years now.  After a 5 hour drive back to the burgh, I thought it was the perfect night to eat tacos.  

I ordered 2 veg tacos, a side of black beans, and chips & salsa (I'm vegetarian).  The counter worker was friendly and hospitable.  At first glance, the tacos were drenched in a cream sauce.  My first bite was disgusting.  The seasoning was so salty and overpowering.  I took a second bite just to make sure.  I was starving, but they went right into the trash.  The black beans were also very strange, and had an odd flavor.  The chips were cold and stale, nothing special.  Salsa was the least terrible thing, but very average and not fresh tasting at all.  

Oh well, my search for a decent food spot in my childhood 'hood continues.  Restaurants like this make me happy to live in delicious Philly!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a taco purist (originally being from Southern California and my favorite being a strictly traditional taco al pastor with nothing more than cilantro, onion, and a medium-hot salsa roja) and I'm also always complaining to people about the lack of authentic (and good) Mexican food in Pittsburgh (aside from the street tacos at the Reyna taco stand), so I went in here with guarded expectations.

It's not strictly traditional (though it is influenced by authentic street tacos), but man, is it yummy.

I ordered three tacos: the pork, the spicy beef, and the daily special, a chipotle chicken. They came out about five minutes after I placed my order and were definitely made to order.

All three were quite delivious and distinctly different from each other.

The spicy beef was the most Americanized of them. It's in a single medium-taco-sized flour tortilla that's been lightly griddled and filled with ground beef and topped with lettuce, tomatoes, shredded yellow cheese, a creamy sauce, and several jalapeno slices.

The pork was on a pair of corn tortillas (about the same size as the flour) and had slightly crispy carnitas in it topped with tomatoes, onion, cilantro, the creamy sauce, and a light dusting of crumbled white cheese (not sure if it was actually Cotija).

The chipotle chicken was similar to the carnitas, except it omitted the tomato, making it the least non-traditional of the bunch.

That said, for what they are (doctored-up street tacos), they were done very, very well. The meat in all three cases (even the ground beef, which I normally eschew as too bland and Americanized) was moist and flavorful, and the creamy sauce (I think they call it \"Bullseye Sauce\") added a wonderfully buttery flavor to the ensemble. I'm not a small eater, and I had also skipped lunch, and the three I had was perfect for satiating me without overfilling me. (Of course, I had to get a waffle next door, which I ultimately probably didn't need to do...)

The sauce options are definitely non-traditional, though. There isn't a traditional salsa bar with homemade salsas (other than the Bullseye Sauce they add to each taco). There's an assortment of a few different kinds of bottled sauces. I think there may have been some Tapatio and one or two others, but the one that stood out to me was the giant-sized pump jug of Cholula green salsa, which worked well on all three of my tacos.

The price was, I felt, fair, at $3 per taco. That might be a little more than street tacos elsewhere, but not much more, and these were definitely more substantial than most $2ish street tacos (where I'd need at least four to fill me up), and some of the added

This will definitely be a place I return to, perhaps even frequently, given its convenient location, reasonably quick service (though not instant), and fair pricing."}
{"text":"Went here for first time with my family, all of us enjoyed it. They were able to accommodate our customizations. Unfortunately no guacamole but they promised it will be back in the spring. I had the brisket chili and a chicken taco also the spicy beef taco which is really good. I wish the brisket chili came with chips but they gave me some when I asked for free. Good taco stand style tacos, maybe the best I've had in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Oh my god, I wish I had good news about this place. It's awful: bland, mushy pork, ground beef seasoned with a packet of taco seasoning, liquid cheese from a can, stale chips, jarred salsa, I could go on and on. It looks like a cool place to get an interesting meal and it's sub-par. I can do better at home.  

Please please get better. I want you to succeed but the tacos at Taco Bell are more flavorful and interesting."}
{"text":"Well here we are. A review so necessary I needed to download the app. For starters, their queso would work really well for a sidewalk being thats its almost like cement mix. Unless you are trying to fight your way through a sea of muck, via S.S. Tortilla Chip (which were scarce, and buried) ask for the queso on the SIDE. On to my next point, FOUND BUG IN NACHOS! Take my word for it. Bad up keep on condiments."}
{"text":"Went here on the advice of a family member and was not disappointed.  Chicken tacos were so good!  Huge portion of chicken with slaw.  Totally full after 3 tacos.  I also got salsa and chips, which were pretty standard.  This will be my new taco spot."}
{"text":"Saw this new place on Murray Avenue and was excited about trying it. Small space with 2 standing tables. 

I ordered 2 veggies tacos and 2 chicken tacos for 2 people. The veggie tacos were good. However, I was disappointed by the lack of seasoning and heat in the chicken tacos. 

Price is reasonable for the quality and quantity. But, it didn't leave an impression on me that would pull me back in there again when I pass by that place."}
