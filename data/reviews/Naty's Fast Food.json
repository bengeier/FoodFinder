{"text":"I didn't want to put any stars on here but in order to post a review I had to Mark something so consider this should be a -1!!  So I called along time ago like maybe 6 months and I told the woman the owner that the catfish tasted really fishy and instead of saying I'm sorry what can I do to make it up to you she hung up on me. So my husband decided he wanted their cat fish tonight. I go in to get it and the woman didn't like the criticism that I gave her six months ago and told me that I posted it on Facebook which I did not and kicked me out of her restaurant and told me that the fish had never change! So basically the lowdown is the owner is psycho and confused me with somebody else and then told me to f off and she thinks this is good customer service for her! The fish taste like it came from the bottom of a sewer it's disgusting so that means that if it didn't change from 6 months ago it still taste the same and the place smells awful the menu looks like it's written by 5 year old good luck to whoever eats there because you should be worried about getting food poisoning or salmonella!"}
{"text":"Don't let appearances fool you! Fantastic tacos and burritos await you inside! Yes, . The place looks outdated. The food more than makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Had the 4 wings / Fries / soda special for $6.95.  Got 5 wings!  Old School fried chicken.  Excellent.  Fries were good but they salt them heavily.  Steady stream of take out customers who all seemed like regulars."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem- This place is great. They have a combo that comes with 1 wing, 1 taco, and 1 pc of catfish. Chicken is well seasoned, although I'd prefer mine to be cooked slightly longer but that's just me. I was impressed with the catfish because I'm usually not a fan of catfish but theirs didn't have that murky lake taste. Also, they used a breading with a mixture of flour and corn meal which is how I do fish at home, so 5 stars on the catfish. I ordered the chorizo taco and it was so-so. I would have given 3 stars but The catfish was exceptionally good and also the woman working was really polite and the place was clean. Overall a better chicken shack then what what we've come to know in Madison."}
{"text":"Stopped in here only twice, but I already know I'm going to be coming back again and again.  Everything I tried was absolutely delicious and the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich is the best I've had anywhere! Not much parking and a little hard to find, but well worth the stop!"}
{"text":"I Always eat here. I  love the food and would recommend this place to ANYone. The catfish dinner is excellent and the chicken is awesome! The tacos are great even the gyros are good. EVERY TIME I COME. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG! The place aint pretty but the food tho...!"}
{"text":"The decor doesn't leave much to shout about, but the tacos are some of the best in Madison. I'm often a three-taco gal, but two tacos at Naty's go well beyond the call of duty. (Raphael dumps a sizable mound of meat on each one.) They also serve Faygo sodas, so there's that... The prices are pretty low, especially at lunchtime. Taco chips are made in-house but somehow don't appear on the menu. I can't speak to the quality of the soul food menu items because I keep coming back to the tacos!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost a year now and it only gets better, they're really working hard to get the place and the food dialed in and it really shows!  One item that I neglected in my original review that deserves a mention is their fantastic fries- nice, thick, perfectly crisp with a soft inside- on par with the best bar or gyro place fries in town.  Rafael and Maria are the friendliest folks in the business, and I always leave feeling like a million bucks."}
{"text":"Great place. I don't care for fanciness or frills, just good satisfying food, and that's what Naty's has. Relatively easy on the wallet, wide selection of simple street food and it comes out delicious and well crafted every time.  If a 10-15 minute wait is too slow for you, that's just too bad, as its well worth the wait. Usually we're used to this simple kind of food taking no time to make, but there's gotta be a good reason for the wait.  The fried chicken comes at a reasonable price and burritos are full of good, real ingredients; not just pumped full of pinto bean mash like some places. These dishes, like most of Naty's menu, are accompanied with at least two handfuls of fries, usually hot and dusted with garlic powder. Hit this place up, if you can find the street parking for it. Keep it up Naty's!"}
{"text":"Ok, this is a 3.25 star review rounded up to 4 because I like small, local businesses.  I don't agree that the tacos are among the best in Madison, but they're not bad (and they do authentic or gringo style). The menu is pretty large (and spread out-- there's the main menu board, then a bunch of signs taped up in various locations with other items listed)-- gyros, tamales, catfish, banana pudding, cheesecake....  Lunch specials were quite inexpensive-- $6-$8 which includes drink and fries.... I think everything is served with fries here.  \"Taco meal\" is not tacos, rice and beans, but tacos and fries!  The food we had was definitely greasy, but greasy food is not necessarily bad!  Just know what you're getting in to. If you go with people who consider dining on Park St to be adventurous, they'll find Naty's to be about as exotic as it gets."}
{"text":"Naty's is great. The prices are affordable and the food is really, really good. Although it's primarily a place that people pick up to go, there is some seating inside as well.   I went there with a few friends, and we ordered a variety of things. Everything I ordered was good, but their fried chicken was absolutely outstanding.  Seriously mind-blowing.   The service was just fine, too. There is only one person handling orders, so sometimes there can be a bit of a wait. But she's very nice and courteous!   Overall, I'd highly recommend Natys!"}
{"text":"We ordered tacos, fajitas, chicken wings and fries. Like many of the reviews state, the decor is shabby. But, I was hopeful that the food would be really good. This was not the case. The food is okay. The prices are good. The service was bad.   The food: The tacos are fine. I ordered them because of the Yelp reviews raving about them. They're not all that. The fajitas meat was more tender. The chicken wings were good but the fries were chunky (which is ok), overly salty (not ok) and worse, cold (really not ok).   The service: there was only one employee working the cash register and she was inexperienced and inattentive. We had to ask for everything: our drinks, ketchup, the sides that I asked to come before the food but didn't, salsa, etc. What's worse is we were the only customers.   They're a small business and I wish I could say that I'd go back, but I won't. The food can't make up for horrible service."}
{"text":"Naty's has the best wings in town. Sure, the place is a hole in the wall, but the time they might have spent decorating has obviously instead been spent on developing the perfect breading for their wings. Their fries are pretty great too, the Parmesan and lemon dust they put on top is delicious.  The tacos are tasty as well. Give this place a chance, its worth it!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Don't let the facade fool you. The prices are super low and food portions very generous. We are only in town for a day, but are already making plans to come back to this restaurant."}
