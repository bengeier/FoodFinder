{"text":"Truly a great place. We've had breakfast here many times, food and service is excellent."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have been amazed by their butter tarts each time. They offer a great variety which range in different flavors such as plain, raisin, coconut and many others. I always get the plain and they taste amazing! They are not overly sweet and are a decent size. Prices as well are reasonable and they offer seating in their patio area or the back with cooked food to offer as well. I definitely plan to come back again and maybe try their cooked food next time!"}

have some really delicious butter tarts :) i always buy them for visiting friends.. some of the bakeries in toronto dont even make them this good. they also serve a mean quiche!


service is always attention, and the ladies who work there are so friendly"}
{"text":"GLUTEN ALLERGY/CELIAC FOLKS BEWARE
I came here with the reviews highlighting how this restaurant took extra precautions when it came to gluten free. I am Celiac and while I realize the risk of eating at a restaurant that is not certified gluten free, I expect that the process be taken seriously to reduce the risk of contamination.  I called in advance and the restaurant pledged their commitment to gluten friendly options and that they took allergies seriously. We decided to go for lunch. I advised the waitress and her staff that I was Celiac prior to sitting down, during my order, AND upon food arrival (this is how paranoid I am). I got something that could not be mishandled. A salad - literally greens and vegetables. I start eating after triple confirming it was in fact gluten free and got olive oil on the side to ensure the dressing was safe. Mid-way through my meal I used my fork to move a piece of lettuce out of the way in the middle of the bowl, revealing a Toonie-sized (1x1 inch) size of BREAD.  BREAD! Not a crumb... and in a salad. The odds of having bread in my salad to begin with at any other restaurant, without highlighting an allergy for gluten, would be next to zero... let alone highlighting that I am CELIAC! I was shocked. The restaurant did not handle it properly and we left and will never return.  It was a cute spot and the staff seemed lovely, but if you have an allergy PLEASE avoid this place. I was sick for 24 hours."}
{"text":"A longtime lover of butter tarts, I've searched far and wide for the perfect tart. By happenstance I drove past this Newmarket jewel today and stopped in where I discovered the butter tart of the ages. A flavourful delight unmatched anywhere. 
Butter 'em up The Maids Cottage, I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service, the waitress Kathleen gave awesome customer service and was super friendly. Would definitely recommend!"}

Their butter tarts are amazing.  Pecan are my favorite
Salads are fresh and very tasty.
We will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"I was here for breakfast, and got a pretty basic two scrambled eggs, sausage, home fries, brown toast and pancakes with decaf.  The sausages did not impress me, nor did the coffee which was fresh brewed to satisfy my request for decaf, but otherwise everything was excellent.  They bake their own bread, and the provided jam is delicious.  Otherwise, it's not hard to do breakfast well, which they do.  Beyond the food, the space is bright and cheerful with plenty of light from the large windows in the back, and the staff was super friendly.  It's a very nice place to come to."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a better review, and in all fairness I'm only reviewing the butter tarts, as this is all I've had here. 
First off, the staff here are great. The bakery counter is a relatively small space, and somewhat separate from the rest of the business (they also have a restaurant space), but the staff are attentive, and are helpful making suggestions. 
I was also fine with the prices. The butter tarts are not cheap, but considering they have a lot packed into them (just feel the weight in comparison to other butter tarts you've had!), and they've been voted best butter tart many times over, I expected to pay what I did. 
With all that though, I honestly didn't think the tarts were great. Nor did I experience consistency with them. In the 4 visits I've made here over the last few months, the first two times I found the tarts to be amazing. Great taste, and perfect consistency. The last two times though, the tarts have been a runny mess. The first time I took a bite, and the whole tart collapsed in my hand. It ended up just being a gooey, runny, albeit tasty pile of stuff on my plate. I was ready to chalk that up to an off day, but when I went back again recently to try again, I was disappointed again. One bite, and most of the filling ran all over my hand and the plate. I don't mind a bit of flow to the filling, but this came out like water. 
The three stars are for the staff and for the delicious taste of the tarts. I'm hoping they improve the filling consistency before I go and try them again"}
{"text":"The butter tarts and the little blueberry crumble tarts are amazing. They also have pre-made frozen meals that are great for the cottage, and an awesome breakfast/lunch menu."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to go for tea and a sandwich. I normally get ham with cheese, tomato, lettuce.. and ALWAYS their house mustard. Their corned beef is awesome too. Finish it off with a tart or a brownie and you're all set.

It's a nice atmosphere, normally an older crowd during the day, or families. Always full of chatter, happy patrons. The servers are kind, and the owners are lovely.

The restaurant moved to a new location a few doors down and now has a tiny patio, and a back entrance which services drinks, desserts, and ice cream.. this to me, was a genius idea.. Take a walk around the fountain and pool on Doug Duncan Drive, wander the farmers market, then pick up a brownie from The Maid's Cottage.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!"}

Both dishes were accompanied by two pieces of garlic bread. Good food in large portions at an affordable price... I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was pleasant, grabbed some tarts to go ~ it was certainly delicious but a little over on the sweet side for me ...

 Tried the plain and pecan tart, I think I liked the pecan one more but, couldn't eat the whole thing because I found it was too sweet for me. 

 Coated $6 for 2 tarts 

Possibly be back to try other stuffs~~"}
{"text":"This quaint cafe sure stays true to its name. First of all it's located on a strip that resembles that of a little winter village. When you walk inside you find yourself stepping into a \"cottage\" with antique-like, cottage-y decor, complete with a creaking wooden floor. 

I visited today because of so many rave reviews regarding their \"amazing butter tarts\" so I was curious. I wasn't overly hungry so I ordered the minestrone \"soup du jour\" and my favorite butter tart - PECAN! 

I sat at the back of the room by the window. My table was the kind you would have found at grandma's with tied-on chair cushions. It was pretty empty but for those who were there, they appeared to be regulars as the staff knew them by name, small town-like. :) 

The minestrone soup wasn't anything special, obviously homemade but definitely not Italian authentic. But i'm was not expecting that from this place. Once that was down the hatch I was ready for the infamous tart!

On looks alone, it didn't wow me and i'm pretty particular about my tarts so I was hoping that the hype was all it was cracked up to be.

Cutting into it with my fork was my first test. I don't like the filling to spill out, I like a more gelatinous texture. Pass!

I liked the thicker pie crust encasing the filling. It was both equal parts buttery, crisp and chewy. Texture love!

Now the filling was smooth, rich and sweet, with the perfect hints of pecans. After devouring it, I had a short argument with my hips and thighs about ordering a second. My hips and thighs won, this time!

Besides Pecan, they have many other choices for tarts as well as biscuits and muffins and other desserts. Any \"defective\" desserts are on display for purchase at a discount and they have coolers filled with Ready-to-serve and frozen entrees to take home. Great for the bachelor in me!

As others would have it said, Yes, place makes a pretty scrumptious tart. I'll have to come back and taste test the others."}
{"text":"All you need to know is BEST Raison Butter Tarts... end of story.  
 

BK"}
{"text":"I know parisian pastries, but not sure how a good butter tart is suppose to be.  All I can say is that the tart itself is pretty good here, but the filling inside makes ALL the difference.  Tried a few and the best was definitely the pumpkin tart because it was not overtly sweet.  The blueberry tart was slightly too sweet and the raisin tart was sugar OVERDOSE.  It was covered in a sugary glaze (I think it was caramel), but it was so sweet that after one bite you already don't want to eat it.    NOT good."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant based on previous reviews here. Want to try a variety of tarts. In a word fantastic. I've never tasted better. Pam served me (one of the owners) Great personality. 

Went back two days later and bought a strawberry/rhubarb pie. Very good and worth the price but not the best i've tasted. That still belongs to Crawfords in Norval. 

This establishment will be my go to bakery in this area.

Note:- The restaurant is NOT open on Sundays but you can purchase tarts to take out from their back entrance."}
{"text":"Cheap diner breakfast. So don't expect fancy. It's worth the 6.99. Potatoes were not hot. DO NOT get coffee, $2 for the worst cup you will ever have. Stick with tea here!!!"}
{"text":"Buttertarts were amazing.  They had a good variety even though it was late in the day.  Friendly service.
Note: A couple didnt make it home.  And the \"not so perfect\" ones are, sorry to say...perfect.  I'd like to go in and sit down sometime. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If I never picked up a volunteering position in Newmarket, I probably would've never found this gem...
You \"butter\" come quick...before they sell out! 
At first, I was unsure where this place was situated as I am not local to Newmarket. I parked about 5 minutes from the store and apparently entered through the back door. But don't be alarmed! You can purchase your delicious tarts from both entrances. The only downside to the downstairs shop is that they have less variety. 
I ended up going upstairs to check out their full menu. I opened the door to a whole new world - a little cafe. It was around noon and the place was packed; I even heard it was going to be a 20 minute wait for some customers. However, I walked my way to the front, following the sweet aroma of home made pastries. 
I was a bit overwhelmed with the selection of tarts: pumpkin, raisin, black currant. Keep in mind that this store doesn't sell just butter tarts, but regular tarts as well. My eyes were locked on the butter tarts though and I left the store with 4 tarts, 3 of which were \"Not-so-perfect.\" These were tarts that had minor defects but to me, a homemade butter tart from one of the best bakeries will always be perfect. Plus, it was slightly less expensive. 
Service was also great, and they definitely get you with their deals! 
Note that Maids' Cottage doesn't only sell butter tarts, they sell a number of frozen pastries you can take home as well. 

Tips for your visit:
-Park on the street east of the store. There will be several rows of parking spaces available near the water park/what I believe was the community centre. 
-Get the not-so-perfects, if there are any"}
{"text":"Food is average. Not sure what all hype is about. Butter tarts are great. Diner like atmosphere that is good for lunch. Nothing special about this place."}

Quite literally the very best butter pecans I have ever eaten in my entire life!

All hand crinkled homemade dough and special sauce. They are mouthwatering and only about $2 each!
The only problem- you won't be able to eat JUST ONE!

Take the drive up to Newmarket and get yourself a delectable dessert, after all you're worth it ;)"}
{"text":"Before you jump to criticize my review, keep in mind that I am not a huge a sweets fan.  I rarely eat desserts and the last time I had a butter tart was maybe 3-5 years ago.  Individual butter tarts were 2.65 each, which is a bit pricier than normal.  I would expect around $2.  

I ordered the pecan butter tart and the plain one.  I really liked the pastry and the crust itself.   In terms of the filling and the taste, it was okay but a bit too sweet for my liking.

Verdict: I would go again if in the area and buy for my fellow sweets fan but not sure I would buy anything for myself."}

{"text":"I love this quaint, charming restaurant. As truly home-grown as a restaurant can be! Their menu is full of comfort food items and homemade specialties. I have had the French toast, the macaroni and cheese, lasagna and of course, have finished off lunch on many occasions with a butter tart and some tea. The service is friendly and pleasant. I especially love the real china that they use to serve tea. Their butter tart has won at the Festival in Midland for the last two years. My only minor complaint is that they're not open later during the week but I make a point of going on the weekends when I can."}
{"text":"This is exactly what I look for in a breakfast restaurant.  Bright, homey, cheery, with stunningly good food.  I had a ham, sautéed mushroom and cheese omelette that was cooked perfectly to order, with some fresh preserves for the toast.  Excellent quality and great service, you could tell that a lot of regulars frequent this place.

Reknowned for its award winning butter tart, I couldn't afford the diabetic coma this morning. But I will be back to indulge..."}
{"text":"This was the first time I had a butter tart so I didn't really know what to expect. Maid's Cottage burst through any possible expectation I could have had. The place is rather small and because it was Sunday, we had to go out back to pick up our butter tarts. 

The butter tart here was incredible. They were so sweet and the filling was just incredible. The pastry was flakey and the layers of pecans on top were nice. I enjoyed the regular butter tart more though. The filling inside was so warm while it oozed out all the sugar and syrup. This is definitely something nice to have on occasion...not after AYCE sushi like my group did.

It's a good thing that this place is all the way up in Newmarket. Those butter tarts would send me right to the grave much earlier than I want to be..."}
{"text":"Finally tried the much anticipated lemon meringue tart. It was only 3 stars in my book because of lemon filling didn't taste like anything. Personally, I like a sour taste to lemon desserts. Presentation was nice though. I liked the fluffiness of the meringue. 

Still a 4 star cause we also got butter tarts and they are honestly to die for! 3 days later, and they are still as yummy as the first day we tried it! Yum!"}
{"text":"My friend who was visiting from the US asked me if we could get some Canadian delicacies. And yes, the first place I thought of was the Maid's cottage. How can you go wrong with those yummy delightful butter tarts with so much buttery goodness?! They come in a variety of flavours but my favourite are the pecan butter tarts. They are gooey and crunchy at the same time!!

The restaurant itself is a cute little place located on the historic Main street of Newmarket. They also serve up some delicious breakfast food. The seating is very limited though. The staff here are very friendly and just wonderful to talk to. 

Their butter tarts are famous in the York region and have been featured many a times. So go early or visit late at the risk of them being sold out for the day. Definitely a must visit if you are in town!"}
{"text":"Simply THE BEST butter tarts ever. I have tasted many, many butter tarts in my life and these ones are at the top of my list. They are completely homemade and sinfully delicious. You can choose from the traditional kinds, raisin and/or pecan, as well as lemon meringue and various other fruit fillings - they are like mini pies and better than pie in my opinion. They also have specialty tarts during certain times of the year such as pumpkin tarts at Thanksgiving. These have become my favourite, especially warm out of the oven with whipped cream on top! At approximately $2.25 per tart, they are worth every penny but if you are looking to save a little and still get the taste, they often have \"less than perfect\" tarts - those which have spilled a little filling over the side - and are at a discounted price. 

This is a wonderful little place to have lunch. They have fantastic homemade soups every day and the food is fresh and simple. Beware, the butter tarts are well known and get snatched up quickly so go early to get your pick. Once you have had a taste, you won't be able to stay away!"}
{"text":"Only one important thing I gotta say: Best Butter Tarts Ever. MUST try, even if you think you don't like butter tarts- give these a try! My fave is the Pecan ones :)"}
{"text":"If they two people I stalk ..... I mean, follow on Yelp gave this place 5/5 stars then its a must try in my books. At first glace these tarts didn't look too appetizing to me. Looked like a glop of brown stuff placed into a buttery tart. For about $11 you can get half a dozen tarts. I got the plan and the pecan flavored ones. I've never tried butter tarts before but if they all taste this good then I'm up for more buttery goodness. I can't figure out what are in these tarts and if some can fill me in that would be great. All I can taste is sweetness, caramel and butter. The other ingredients I can't put my finger on it. They are definitely really yummy but not the healthiest of treats....but then again what treat in this world is healthy. I came to this unhealthy judgement because as I was heating them up over a frying pan, all I could see was the butter leaking out of it. But an unhealthy snack has never stopped me from eating them. Overall a great recommendation. Oh yeah, I follow only 2 people on Yelp and they are none other than Kris U. and Jennifer K.  - I know Kris U. is gonna tell me to follow more people on Yelp if he reads this but I only have so much time to do my most favorite things which is eating and sleeping."}
{"text":"We purchased scrumptious butter tarts (plain) and pecan tarts, breakfast and plucked tea.  A note on the plucked tea, it is different from your standard tea bag.  Plucked tea means you get the whole leaf not broken leaves and dust.  The peach tea here at the Maid's Cottage is not \"artificial\" there is a pleasant but not strong peach scent and flavor from the dried bits of fruit.
Amazing hospitality and the breakfast was very affordable keep in mind this is right on Main St in New Market.  Their toast with butter and marmalade alone is yummy because the bread is fresh baked."}
{"text":"Cute little bakery / lunch spot in Newmarket. The thing that drew me in here were the butter tarts. I've been craving butter tarts for awhile.My co-worker recently brought some in from a school fundraiser. I have no idea where she got them from but it was one of the most amazing things I ever tasted. I could have scarfed down a box.  I'm also kinda addicted to the ones at Crema. I believe they are made by Circles and Squares. But it's too far a trek to go downtown on a weekday. So when I tried to find butter tarts uptown, this place came up my radar.

 I ordered 3 raisin and 2 plain. All of which were delicious. I did find their tarts to be  bit too rich - it's super dense, yet still a big runny on the inside once you dig in midway. The inconsistency boggles me but it's definitely a really good treat. I love the thick pie crust - I love pie crust! It's very satisfying especially with a cup of good java!"}
{"text":"Butter tarts.. they even sell the seconds but a warning here - it will disintegrate so fast that you'll be licking your fingers for the rest of the day.

The restaurant is not open on Sundays.  So I will still need to return to try it out.  The staff are always very friendly and welcoming of new faces."}
{"text":"So, Butter Tarts are not a thing in the United States. I know, this comes as a shock to most Canadians, as you can buy them everywhere.

Still, I'd never heard of them until recently. I decided I wanted to try some, and we were heading out to the area, so I figured, why not try just any butter tarts, but the best butter tarts imaginable (at least, according to reviews.)

So, Yelp recommendations in hand, we headed here.

There's a bakery counter up front, and I perused the selections while we waited to be seated. It was cold enough that I wanted to sit down and try some, and I needed some coffee as well. They have a full breakfast menu on Saturdays, but we skipped that, since we were going to be having lunch shortly. 

We were seated at a charming table, and served some coffee, which was quite excellent. I really enjoyed how they have a random collection of coffee mugs. Lee decided to embarrass me a little bit by explaining that I was an American and had never had butter tarts before, but I think that that pleased the waitress very much, because she was quick to recommend getting half a dozen and explaining which were traditional flavors and which weren't. She also gave advice on storage if we didn't manage to get through them this weekend (they lasted until Monday morning!)

I am hardly an expert on butter tarts, as I said, but I know pastries, and these were excellent from a pastry standpoint. Delicious flaky crust. Lee agreed that they were very good, and he said that these were some of the finest he's had.

So, this place is definitely worth a drive, or a stop by if you happen to be in town."}
{"text":"I haven't Googled this yet, but I'm almost 99% sure that I visited this place LAST year, after the Holland Marsh Soupfest and it was located in a different, smaller location.  Then again, I could be wrong.

Bad memory aside, I had a very positive impression during my visit on a busy Saturday afternoon.  The girl behind the counter was very patient, helpful, and never lost her cool even though she had to multi-task by serving customers in person, answering the phone to take a reservation, and having other people waiting for her attention.  I was very impressed by here!

Right when you walk in to The Maids' Cottage, you see what the place specialises in...butter tarts!  They had so many different kinds, including a hidden basket of \"Not So Perfect\" (under/overcooked, over/under filled) tarts that were $1.99.  Treasures, I tell you!  Otherwise, tarts - no matter what kind - were $13.99/6, no tax OR $2.85ea.

Since I was watching my waistline and don't have a huge sweet tooth, I opted to go the NSP route and got a coupla from that basket.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with the ones I had, they were delicious! 

Aside from butter tarts, it's also a restaurant that looked quite busy.  I'm curious as to what they serve and how the food is.  Until next time, The Maids' Cottage..."}
{"text":"Diabetics:  Beware.  Stay away.  Buy some for me and don't eat any!  ;)

OMG, soo good, probably the best butter tarts that I've had AND I'm not even a sweets person!  Definitely sweet though.  Wash down with unsweetened coffee/tea.

About $2.50-3ea.  2 tarts were like $6 'n change.  

I sorta 'forgot' about the tarts (Plain, Pecan) for a coupla days after SoupFest - long story - but when I ate them, they tasted fresh still.  An indication of the amount of sugar perhaps?  

Pastry tasted like a butter cookie.  Will never buy that grocery store crap again as it can't even compare!  Mmm...drool... 

Tip:  A few spots around back of the building, in front of skatepark."}
{"text":"Love going to this place for the early bird breakfast special - your typical breakfast but comes with homemade jam that changes everyday. Cute decor and good place to start your day. Not a fan of butter tarts, but I haven't heard a bad review yet!"}
{"text":"I noticed this place as we were skating across the road at the local community centre and my wife told me she had read the previous reviews, so, we decided to erase the calorie burn of skating to give these butter tarts a try.  

I walked around to the front, but realized they were closed, but have a take out  in the back which I didn't notice. The girl helping was very friendly and we ordered a dozen tarts, 4 of each available flavour (current, plain & raisin, there was no pecan at this time). The total was $18.95 for 12 tarts. 

We got to our destination, had lunch and were excited to try these treats. First I tried the current and man was I in sugar heaven. Without being overly sweet, the balance of the flavour was perfect. Although I did find the currents to be a bit too dry of a fruit for my personal tastes, the raisins were nice and plump, and plain was just great too, if not preferable. 

It's a good thing this place is across from a skating rink, because you will definitely need to work these tasty treats off, and they are worth every minute of it! I will definately be back here for more tarts, and I would love to try other items from their full menu upstairs."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my boyfriend and we loved it. It reminded me of the east coast. The cinnamon French toast was bomb. Everything was very tasty and flavourful. Will be back next week!"}
{"text":"I finally got around to try their award winning butter pecan tarts and it was heavenly.  There were so many flavors to choose from like apple crumble, peach and and pumpkin pie butter tart, I felt like a little kid in a candy store.

This space also extends to the back where it's a little restaurant serving brunch and lunch. It has typical food items like eggs and more unique items like quiche. Now we are excited to come back and try their brunch and more of the butter tarts next time!"}
{"text":"Dropped in to pick up some butter tars while visiting the farmer's market. The butter tarts are tasty, lots of varieties as well, (pecan, cranberry, etc.) However the service was terrrible. There is a bell that you ring for service and bakery staff come to help you. The woman who served us made it seem like it was a huge hassle to get us six butter tarts because she was \"so busy!\" Customer service 101- don't make your customer feel like they are a nuisance. Next time I'll buy butter tarts at the farmer's market. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Warning: This place will break da mouth 

Any TRUE butter tart fan who has combed the cottage roads, followed the butter tart trail up north and around the kawarthas, been to the arts and crafts fairs will truly respect the Maids Cottage. 

To be fair for the sake of Yelping, I had the plain butter tart (base line test) vs the raisin, black currant, the peach cobbler, the pumpkin and carrot. These are heavy heavy heavy! In weight and per serving. For reference, I couldn't eat more than 2 trying, but can easily finish 1/2 dozen at Krispy Kreme and run 5k!

Buttery Shortbread base holds back a slightly liquid and gooey filling underneath a crispy sugar crust. One needs the goo and it needs to be a bit runny but not gushing, as per the crust that ain't caramel, it's just the baked corn syrup/sugar that gets caramelized while baked to make the brûlée like topping. Butter tarts are not French in any way and never should be. 

So a purist will not tolerate anything in their butter tart, but the raisin was good and had business being there, the peach tried too hard that's not a butter tart, it's just a peach cobbler hiding in a shortbread shell, pumpkin was nice for fall but only 30% butter tart 

Parking on street or behind, small patio out front looks onto a cute Main Street. Cyclist love to stop here on their weekend so beware of huge cycling groups snatching up tarts on the weekend. 

They also make other home cooked foods, savory meat pies but they are well known and loved for the best butter tarts in GTA. Sue's supermarket in Richmond Hill is carrying their tarts now but seem to sell out quite often."}
{"text":"The food it pretty good but service is bad.  They don't seem to know who's getting what food and service is slow.  I'm guessing the issue is the waitstaff seem they don't know what they are doing"}
{"text":"I have only one complaint about The Maid's Cottage...it is not open on Sunday. I do not understand this logic at all. They are missing out on a day of huge revenue; the after church crowd, the weekend brunch crowd, the visitors to town crowd, etc. etc. etc.
Please open on Sunday! Otherwise, lots of seating, good service, reasonable prices, good menu with lots of selection, tasty butter tarts."}
{"text":"The BEST butter tart I ever have! 

The Maid's Cottage's butter tarts are just so good! The crust so flaky and buttery! The fillings so smooth and silky like melted caramel! 

I ate mine so fast while my Yelp friend kept admiring his! I almost want to grab it from him and just eat it!!

I can eat a half a dozen of these tarts with no problem...until I find out their calories and sugar count. How can these little delicious pastry so unhealthy but this sinfully indulgence is worth every single calories!

4 different flavors to choose from Plain, Pecan, Raisin and Currant at $2.25 each.

The bakery is located at the back on the store, facing Newmarket Community Centre with ample parking around the area.

The Maid's Cottage now is my must visit stop next time I am up in Newmarket!"}
{"text":"Main Street Newmarket is a really cute stretch of town. I was there with a few close friends that highly recommended this place to go to lunch so that's where we went.

The staff are so warm and friendly and I really liked that when you order a tea they give you a choice of a tea cup or a mug. Everything on the menu looks really good, but I went with the daily special that was the butter chicken with rice and toasted pita bread. They also offer an all-day breakfast menu. They have a nice choice of meat pies, but my friend ordered one and it didn't arrived warm enough but we soon discovered that it was actually heated in a microwave that didn't have that nice flakey and crispy crust that my friend was expecting.

The atmosphere is really nice and in the back of the restaurant you have a nice view of the theatre and skating rink. They have a large parking lot you could park for free which is really nice.

My butter chicken was actually really good and their famous award-winning butter tarts is a must try and to die for! I'm not really a sweets type of person but their butter tarts are really good that I grabbed a box to go to give to my friends back in the city. To be honest, I never had a butter tart, so I went with the traditional raisin and also a pecan and they were both really good. Next time I will try one of their dozen or so different flavours. They even have a gluten-free version too."}
{"text":"We found this place while strolling main street in Newmarket. This place specializes in butter tarts. So many different BUTTER TARTS to choose from. I was overwhelmed with choices. If you buy 6 tarts then you don't pay taxes. Each tart is $2.89 plus tax which is a bit more expensive than usual but they are so worth it and they are huge. 
I decided to go with the classics so I can compared them with other butter tarts. The plain and pecan butter tarts were delish. The shell was butterily rich. Yum! I also tried the blueberry butter tart which was just ok; it was hollow in the center; not the whole thing was filled with blueberry and not as sweet the other tarts 

I will return when I'm in the area, would try some of the other tarts"}
{"text":"In love with this place! Homemade food, good sized portions. The food is delicious! Try the Shepard's Pie, Lasagna, and Chicken Pie! Also, the quiche is amazing! They have a large variety of teas, which is pretty great. They have frozen pies you can take home and many other things like cabbage rolls and perogies, lots of desserts, as well."}

I have to admit, it is *the* best butter tart I had tasted.  I don't think anything I have tried could even come close. BUT  it is just too sweet, I feel my diabetes forming.   They need to provide an option with less sugar for me to give it a 5-star rating.  Just drink a diet coke to flush a bit of the sugar out.

For the frugal people, they also have the \"not so perfect\" butter tarts at $1.70 each.  They're still good enough for me, but same issue ... too sweet.

The staff is friendly and accommodating to the fact that we had a misunderstanding on what my wife and I wanted and had to redo the order. 

Going all the way to this place is well worth the drive.  There's AMPLE FREE parking near-by, the route I would take is from Davis and Main drive south until you reach the end (that way you get a feel of the Main Street, Newmarket.  Then drive up just a little past Maid's cottage and turn right into a narrow one way street where the green P parking sign appears.

Get your sugar rush going from the cafe and charge uphill looking at the local shops, then cross the street and head south until you reach Books, Cafe & Things as a coffee/rest stop then head off."}
{"text":"Stopped by along my walk on Main St in Newmarket. Glad I did! Such a wonderful/magical place where tarts are heavenly. I only tried the lemon meringue tart, but the service and yumminess of the tart makes me want to come back. Will most likely try all the other tarts on my next visit."}
{"text":"I had a quiche and the other diners had an all day breakfast. Got a pot of tea and it was perfect. It was an absolutely terrific experience. Food was great and atmosphere was fun"}
