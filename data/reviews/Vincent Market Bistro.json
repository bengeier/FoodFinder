{"text":"Last night we invited two couples from out of town to meet at Vincents Bistro. We made reservations for the evening. We enjoyed our dinner and wine, ordered souffle for dessert. Just as I was sipping my first cup of coffee, a server came to our table and told us we had five minutes to finish as people were waiting for our table.   How embarrassing, after telling everyone that this was one of my favorite restaurants. We spent hundreds of dollars on dinner and wine. Our meal was very good, but I don't think my friends will go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to have brunch in Phoenix. I visited Vincent's Market Bistro Sunday the 11th. I met a girlfriend of mine for brunch and we were sat at our table immediately - it was about 10:45 AM. The server first brought us a fresh plate of warmed homemade croissants and blueberry preserves as he took our drink order. The coffee is good and served with cream if you like. The menu selection at brunch has appetizers, a couple of entrees, and traditional breakfast items. My personal favorite is the selection of quiche which is served with a side salad. You must try the quiche - any of the selections- at least once! The flaky pastry crust with the light crusted top and the savory custard whipped filling you fork glides through so smoothly - so delicious! It's a perfectly filling portion for brunch. There are so many good food options to pick from. The atmosphere is nice to have conversation - not too loud and not too quiet. At the end of our meal, we each were presented with an expected dessert dish (one chocolate and one blueberry) both were amazing!! The service is outstanding, the food is delicious and I will always keep going back to this lovely little brunch spot in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Three of us arrived on a Sunday for breakfast and there was no one to take your name or create a list of who had arrived first, which caused some chaos.   There were two groups in front of us who were doing some minor squabbling with each other over who should get the next available table. I walked in to the main counter, and a waiter approached me. He told me it would 10-15 mins for my party of three.  I went back to the patio and waited in line. A man and his parents arrived after us, asked me where they should put their name down, and I told him to just inform a waiter you're here.  After about 20 minutes (and now that we're next in line) a table opened up and the man with his parents just walked over and sat down. I followed, told him we were next in line and he just responded, \"There is no 'real' line.\"  That guy was clearly a schmuck, but the reason it happened was Vincent Market Bistro had no system to create a list for who should be seated in order of arrival. Considering that even the IHOP has mastered this concept, one would hope Vincent can get a grip on it going forward.  To be fair, the manger came over later and apologized and gave us a mountain of free deserts. But, he had no real response as to why there isn't a host or hostess to keep people happy.  The croissants are amazing, the ham and Gruyere omelette was average, and the service was decent (once we were seated, which we did ourselves since no one offered to seat us at anytime.)  Kinda crazy, but for the hassle involved, I'd rather just go to Snooze down the street. It's an hour wait there, but at least they have a hostess."}
{"text":"This little place adjoins the main restaurant, Vincent's on Camelback, by Chef Vincent Gerithault (sp?).  All simple and astonishingly delicious dishes.  I've had their salads, coq au vin, burgundy beef, salmon, specials, desserts, and not a dog in the bunch.  Service has been spot on.  Every time.  The atmosphere is \"French country\" and very comfortable.   When the bill comes, it almost appears to missing a digit - it's very affordable.  The whole place exists for the sheer purpose of sharing the chef's delicious, beautifully-presented meals.      The main restaurant is there to really showcase the Chef's true talent and should not be missed.  It's a great value as well, but expect to pay for a real meal.  One last thing, during the cooler months, the parking lot at Vincent's (Cmbk, West of 40th St) is turned into something like a farmer's market with a lot of delicious food served up.  It's very comfortable with a European feel and usually well-attended.  It's a great way to taste some great food."}
{"text":"You know that little, lesser-known, hole-in-the-wall, amazing restaurant that you wish you could think of on a beautiful Saturday or Sunday morning, to spend your entire morning at, enjoying the weather, sipping fantastic coffee with impeccably made pastries (croissants!), rich b√©chamel sauce on some incredible egg dish and a waiter that just brings you randomly delicious things that you didn't order (and he doesn't charge you for!) because he had them in the back and just thought you might like them? Well, you found it.  This is the \"little secret place\" you take your out of town friends to. This is the place you lose track of time at with your good friends, laughing and eating the whole morning away until you leave stuffed, totally happy and ready to relax and enjoy the rest of your day.  Love this place. Easy to recommend. We have wandered in on Saturday and Sunday anywhere between 9 and 11am and never had an issue finding a seat. Very casual experience. Start with a cappuccino, enjoy the fresh hot croissants for a while, maybe get a chocolate one (dear god, so good), maybe another cup of coffee, order some breakfast, talk, laugh and just enjoy.  Then be shocked at the end of this beautiful meal when the bill comes, and it is no more than any other breakfast place and the owner probably didn't even charge you for some of the items just so you'd have a better experience (happened every time we've gone). Vincent's place has a really wonderful/relaxed energy that is all about enjoying your day and we do every time we go."}
{"text":"Amazing croissants as always! I liked the feel of the place. The menu had great options, and I liked that there were many specials as well. We got the cheese ravioli and the shrimp crepes. Both were good! Our favorite was the corn and avocado spread on top of the crepes. The prices were great!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful restaurant.  We were there on a Thursday for lunch.  Service was excellent, except the meals came out one at a time.   By the time I got my meal, the others in my party of four were half way through their lunch.  Other than that, it was great."}
{"text":"Pro:  value, charm, quality, independent  Con:  haven't found one yet....  Sleeper alert.  Great breakfast, well-priced served with a smile. Ditto for dinner. Simple, relatively healthy comfort food.   Good Euro feel to it but not overkill.  Nice change of pace from the generic chains.   Well worth a try for a quiet couples dinner or breakfast with the kids--they can draw, play hangman etc on the butcher paper table top.  Comp. rolls to start and dessert to finish with breakfast.  Nice touch."}
{"text":"Cozy place for classy dinner.  Beautiful dish presentation. Delicious food and numerous deserts. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday breakfast after church.  The staff is friendly and was great with my daughter.  Croissants are yummy and my daughter loved the cookies after the meal."}
{"text":"Excellent food but not a large menu. It is a very nicely decorated.  My problem: no bathroom.  I asked where it was and was given vague directions for a place \"next door \" which I never found. I had to find a gas station to use their facilities.  If you serve food you should have a bathroom or at least be able to direct customers properly"}
{"text":"Great French cooking.  The bistro shares a kitchen with Vincent's fine dining side.  They offer a small standard menu and several seasonal dishes along with a pre-fix menu at a very reasonable price.    The staff has always been friendly and willing to guide you through the menu and or the wine list.  The space is tight but that is part of its charm.  This is a great place for a date night or dinner with friends.    Vincent is a superb chef and Phoenix has been blessed to have him put down roots here.  The bistro is a great addition.   ."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has the perfect lunch portions, atmosphere and menu. I think it would be hard to find a better place for lunch. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is the place to be! They have great food and excellent service! It has a cozy ambience and their staff is very accommodating and friendly. Their food is very much affordable and it will surely delight your taste buds!"}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in phoenix! Food is delicious, staff friendly and ambiance is warm and charming!"}
{"text":"So if I want to impress my friends, I always ask them to go to Vincent Bistro for breakfast. The croissants are to die for, and come when the waiter arrives..yum all the way around! Try the raspberry scones too!"}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in the United States.  We schedule our flights in and out of Phoenix to include meals at Vincent's Market Bistro.  We have gone to spring training to eat every evening at the bistro.  Never a disappointment."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great ambiance, fabulous service!  This could be my new favorite place for breafast/brunch. We both had the ham quiche and oh my was it ever yummy!  The mini-croissants and jam were just as good.  The complimentary chocoate cake with vanilla ice cream rounded out a perfect meal.  And the price can't be beat - $22 for two meals and drinks.  I'm heading back next weekend!!"}
{"text":"How this place would get more than 1 star is a wonder to me. Tried the cheese plate, something like $12..came with dried out, incredibly hard to eat bread and about 6 cheese sections. Horrible service, only about 6 people in the whole place and took 30 minutes to get the cheese plate and panini. Lackluster interior, just yuck."}
{"text":"There are a few things I LOVE about this place. It's very quaint, they serve you warm, buttery homemade croissants with jam when you sit down, plus at the end of your meal, you get a complimentary dessert - which is different every time and is always delish. It keeps me coming back!  I've been here a few time for breakfast and lunch. I absolutely love their omelets - super fluffy! I've yet to find anything I love on their lunch menu, but nothing is bad either.   Next time I go, I hope to go for dinner and try their pizza.  I come here often with my boyfriend who loves the croissants and dessert too - but it's the perfect place for a lunch with your girlfriends."}
{"text":"My family and I had just landed from the East Coast and were looking for a delicious bite in Phoenix. We saw Vincent's was listed as a good brunch spot so we headed over. We were overwhelmed with how amazing the food and service were. It was a meal that no one in my family will forget! Our waiter was fantastic and so gracious. The croissants are to die for! They were warm, buttery, and served with a scrumptious fresh strawberry jam. We had the homemade pesto pasta with chicken, eggs florentine, crab cakes, and the ratatouille omelette. Each dish was made to perfection and clearly made fresh for us. To top it all off to celebrate the new year we received 5 complimentary desserts, each one different and better than the next. I wish I lived in Phoenix just so I could visit this establishment regularly! Definitely worth going back to!"}
{"text":"We came here for both lunch and dinner on a Saturday.  Both meals were excellent and the service was impeccable.  It was hard to decide what to order. Everything looked so good."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Vincent's for such a long time, and today was the day. So many people had mentioned how lovely the brunch menu is here...   I am happy to say that we have found our new favorite breakfast / brunch destination! Vincent's has the best brunch menu in all of the Valley--hands down.   We started with the four tiny croissants and jam that our friends had mentioned were so delicious (they were!). My boyfriend had the lobster quiche which arrived with a side of greens and I ordered the tomato, basil, and mozzarella omelette. We also shared cinnamon raison brioche which came to us warm, full of raisons, with a perfectly \"eggy\" taste. Everything was absolutely wonderful and our only concern was that we couldn't possibly finish everything they had brought!   The prices are considerably lower than what you'd expect to pay for such a delightful meal. :-)  My boyfriend commented that this is the best brunch spot he's found since he left New York."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Best value for upscale restaurant in Phoenix. Coq au vin was great. Save room for the lemon souffl√© crepe. Waiter and service were terrific."}
{"text":"It's more like 3.5 stars.  The food was good for the price.  I can't quite say it's authentic French.  The croissant was dripping with butter but it wasn't flakey, soft and buttery.  How many French people cook with ginger?  Duck ravioli was overpowered by ginger.  Also, it was a bit undercooked.  The entrees portions were small so overeating won't be a problem.  The seabass and the lamb were well prepared.  The coconut ganache was good.  If they had creme brulee on the menu, it would have been better.  The service was superb.  I think we'd give it another go."}
{"text":"This a hidden gem I love this place  The food is yummy and the service well it's the best in town  For 10 bucks you get the best lunch in town  So the servers are the same people every time and the always remember you The vibe is all French bistro The private dining is great for meeting  You need to try this place"}
{"text":"Very nice quaint restaurant.  The food was delicious from the complimentary croissants with blueberry sauce to the entr√©es.  My boyfriend had a panini and I had the crab cakes very well executed meals.  The service is great and we even got complimentary desserts.  I would come back, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Reliving my summer in France, I have been sampling French cuisine around the valley.  Found this quaint little bistro that is so charming.  The ambiance is spot on French country.  The colors, furnishings, paintings and flowers on the plates made me feel like I was in Provence was more.  Stopped in for a late breakfast.  The mini croissants and preserves were wonderful.  Ordered a quiche that was absolutely perfect with such lovely flavors and served with a wonderfully light salad.  I can't wait for my next visit to the French countryside of the Vincent Market Bistro."}
{"text":"You can't beat a $20 per fix menu in a bistro. BTW it was yummy, excellent sauces. However, if you are on the diet, this is not a good place for you, they use lot and lot of cream"}
{"text":"Ahh this is one of my husband and my most favorite Phoenix restaurants. If you are a fan of excellent French cuisine this is the place to go. Keep in mind this is not your typical trendy Scottsdale restaurant. This is a restaurant that has great character and charm. The croissants pre meal are to die for and their dishes are always on point! The salmon is my personal favorite and the service has always been great. Not to mention the complimentary desserts offered after dinner are divine. We are always the youngest couple there but we would like to keep it that way ;)"}
{"text":"I really like the ambiance here for breakfast but the service is TERRIBLE and they are always out of staple items, like English Breakfast tea.   I had a morning business meeting breakfast here, paid the bill and tipped 20%. I asked for more tea and got charged again, okay, fair enough. I paid the additional bill but did not tip again on the $2.50, the waiter followed me outside and confronted me about why I didn't tip again on the second bill as I was standing with my client. Tacky.  Also, they need to step up the menu.  The menu is limited and not prepared very well, which is a shame, because it has a great Euro Cafe type of environment."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, loved this place!! It's a hidden gem.. food was so tasty and environment was fresh and welcoming! Coming back and telling others"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and it didn't disappoint. I love the environment, cozy and vintage. Wish we could came here for dinner too but we had to hit the road... We had two persons and they split the dishes for us in a very nice way without needing to ask for it. Both dishes were very good, and I recommend the \"egg on a hole\" (something like that), the sauce was sooo good! It was an inexpensive breakfast that makes u feel it was!"}
{"text":"My taste buds were watering and I was super excited to try the bistro.  Even though it was lunch, I got to get the ravioli. That is on the dinner menu.  My son Devoured it and he is sometimes a picky eater.    My husband had the smoked salmon and before I knew it-gone.  It just melted in his mouth.  We got the panni for the kids and my husband and I ended up eating it.   I am so glad since the combination of favors was truly rewarding.  The chef is a master in the kitchen and I can't wait to go back and try another dish.  We got croissants and I would love to have the recipe for it since that is all my daughter would eat.   Recipes for all the food.  The pricing was very reasonable.   Can't believe the deserts.  There were so many and they melted in your mouth.  Wish I knew what was in all of them.  Master Chefs and than some.   Please go there and try the spectacular food.   I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great spot for excellent food at excellent prices.  Portions are on the small but sufficient size, helping keep the prices in line.  Try the $20 three course dinner."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Vincent Market Bistro several times over the past year, and we never have had a bad meal.  The restaurant itself is very cozy and cute, the prices are very reasonable, and the servers and staff are really sweet and professional.  It's a great place to get brunch.  My boyfriend and I both like the smoked salmon quesadillas and the 3 cheese tartine.  For entrees, I often get the herb shrimp crepe with avocado corn salsa, but my boyfriend prefers the crispy duck confit.  We both really like the sautweed salmon, too.  The chef uses really fresh ingredients.  So, everything that comes out of the kitchen is really yummy.  All the desserts are wonderful, too.  We usually share either the creme brulee or peach tart at the end of our meals here."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The food is great, the service is wonderful and everyone is super friendly. They have the most delicious fresh croissants that they bring out with jam before you order and I swear that's half the reason I keep coming back here. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who lives in or visits Phoenix."}
{"text":"When it comes to breakfast, my husband and I always try a new place. Today, I decided I want something a little bit more refined. I found this little restaurant and realized its right next to our favorite sushi place- Sushiholics. So 40th and Camelback is my jam now!  The food was very good- I had Vincent's panini, which was nice and crunchy with a small salad included, which was refreshing. Hubby had egg in a hole, which he ate without saying a word. Seriously. The man didn't speak once except when he finished and went, \"that was really good\". I really appreciated the complimentary croissants with blueberry jam, it was warm and very comforting. We also got complimentary dessert, which I think pushed us from \"pleasantly full\" territory to \"I need to unbutton my pants\" territory. We got a brownie and apple tart with ice cream for the dessert.   Honestly, I'm very impressed that a place like this exists. It was such a lovely morning and the service was attentive and polite. The decor inside is very tasteful and it made me think of a French cafe.  Overall- will absolutely return to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"as always the food was amazing the beef and the lamb braise to perfection super tender the gravy for the beef just the right about of wine  thus is a a grate lunch spot for the price you can't beat it"}
{"text":"Been back a few times now.  Service is still great but the consistency of the food is on and off.  The croissants however, are always amazing.    Don't be surprised if you're surrounded by 50+'s here.  We always seem to be the youngest couple in the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was great... Sunday Brunch Service...not so much (they weren't even that full).  We will be back because the food was so good!"}
{"text":"I read about this place in food and wine or bon appetit so I made a point to try when I was in Phx. It did not dissappoint.  I came for brunch.  I had the nicoise salad and a glass of rose. perfecttly tasty"}
{"text":"We had an excellent French meal at the Bistro. It was very reasonably priced, and the wait staff was friendly and attentive. This will be a go to restaurant for us."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite little spots, and have been coming here for years. You can't beat Vincent's lovely French fare at these prices. The menu has some regular items (the curly endive salad with bacon and mustard dressing is among my favorite salads in the world!); the shrimp crepe and lamp shank are both to-die-for! The souffl√©s for dessert are spectacular. But the best thing about Vincent's Bistro is Scott... Our favorite server. He has been there for years, and treats his customers like family. You will not be disappointed at Vincent's Market Bistro -- if we have a celebration, this is where we come. So should you! If you come early and the place is packed (often the case on a Saturday evening) just meander over to the bar at Vincent's (the two restaurants are adjoined and share a kitchen) -- it's not so bad to enjoy a drink at Vincent's \"proper\" while you wait for a table at the Bistro. Best of both worlds! We have even seen Sandra Day O'Connor and the late Muhammed Ali dining at the Bistro... It's clearly enjoyed by the famous AND the \"regulars people\" - LOL. And this is NOT a pricey place. Vincent's is a big more high-brow, but the Bistro is less expensive, and has a casual French feel to it. Kid friendly too (if your kids are adventuresome eaters like ours) but no kid menu, per se.  Generally an older crowd, and while not a boisterous place, it's small/intimate so it can get a little loud. But we LOVE it, and can't recommend it enough! Ask for Scott -- tell him Cara and Mike sent you!"}
{"text":"Delicious complimentary croissants - and unique menu with a variety of flavor, yet affordable price. We got free dessert with our brunch! SO TASTY"}
{"text":"I am a picky eater and rarely write a review. But Vincent Market is so good and with a very reasonable price. Eating at Vincent reminds me of my restaurant experience in Europe, very cozy. Food is really good. Don't ask which one on the menu is good. You won't go wrong with anything. And everything is homemade, jam with croissant, pasta, ice cream, etc. Price is much cheaper than Vincent Camelback, but food quality and taste are matched. Actually they share some of the menu items, such as Maine lobster with pasta, rack of lamb, halibut, etc. This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food, cozy little place, and affordable even for a college student. I recommend the lobster bisque and lamb shank. Only downside is that they don't have cr√®me br√ªl√©e on some days."}
{"text":"Went there for Mother's Day brunch. The food was great and the service was even better. You can never go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Great, casual alternative to Vincent's on Camelback with the same quality food and service at a lower price point.  Similar to his Sunday Farmer's Market, Vincent Guerithault is continuing in his mission of bringing authentic French food to Phoenix. While formal French dining often has the reputation of being expensive and stuffy, everyday eating in France is not like this and Vincent's Market Bistro brings that traditional, French country dining style to the fore.  We were there with my in-laws, our kids, and my brother-in-law and his boyfriend and we were certainly not the youngest group there. In fact, there was another table composed entirely of kids from St. Francis elementary school and Brophy / Xavier high schools.  You have the choice of a prix fixe menu for $25 or individual items, but nothing is too expensive.   We started with appetizers including the smoked salmon quesadilla, the tomato and mozarella salad, and even introduced the kids to escargot, which they liked!  For the main course, I had the coq au vin and others had the duck confit, four cheese ravioli, wood fired pizzas, and beef bourguignon. Everyone enjoyed their meals and service was excellent.   As we finished up, our server, unprompted by us, brought out a selection of complimentary desserts that everyone enjoyed.  If you're looking for a nice, affordable, evening on the town with great food and great service, head over to Vincent's Market Bistro and you'll leave feeling like you've just spent a great evening in the South of France."}
{"text":"Vincent's market bistro is my usual weekday go to. Always pleased with there salads, soups, apps, mains and desserts! Scotty and the staff are the best. You know a place is good when there clientele have been going there for years and years."}
{"text":"I am a Francophile and this is Phoenix's most authentic and delicious French bistro. I've been here dozens of times and probably have tried just about everything on the menu. My favorites are the pork loin, beef bourguignon, or any of the daily prix-fixe menus. The plates are a modest size, so I recommend the prix fixe menu or an appetizer salad if you are starved. Before you order, the server brings you a plate of buttery homemade croissants. After every meal you are given a complimentary dessert. Frankly, if you're on a budget, you can order just a main plate (with the free croissants and dessert) and you will leave the Bistro full and satisfied with a $15 ish dent in your wallet. On the other extreme, you can have a decadent 3 or 4 course meal with a bottle of French wine and easily pay upwards of $50 a person. The food is all served on beautiful vintage Villeroy & Boch china with whimsical patterns of flowers or horses. The space of the Bistro is intimate: tightly packed tables, no hostess stand, low ceilings. I love it. The customers here tend to be a bit older and I've never seen kids at the Bistro."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Quaint little dining room next to the formal Vincent's. Their brunch menu is very small but great! Prices are shockingly low and every table gets croissants and jam. The chef brought us over a dessert sample just because.   Great weekend brunch or lunch option."}
{"text":"Well, I love it here. I love the fact that I can visit and have a lovely small meal while sitting quietly and either reading a book or NYT, studying or chatting with friends in a cozy little room. And, feel appreciated for stopping through!  Additionally, if there's a foodstuff that I can't live without, I buy it.   Usually heirloom tomatoes.  Damn good stuff."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of prix fixe menus in concept, but often they lack in, well, yumminess.  They often are bland and boring.  Not so here.  Quite yummy, in fact.  The been and goat cheese salad was beautiful and delicious.  I asked for \"as rare as possible\" for my lamb, and it was RARE.  Awesome.  My wife had the halibut&sea bass, which was also awesome.  When we started hemming and hawing about the dessert, the waiter decided to bring us one of each.  All were great, but my wife liked the coconut and pineapple pie most, while I leaned toward the strawberry cobbler.   It's a beautiful place, the portions are a good size, and the waiter was wonderful and non-presumptuous.  Go.  Eat.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 5 Stars in my book. We took our N. Scottsdale friend here for her Birthday Dinner based on reviews from some friends on Yelp and were blown away with every aspect of this Beautiful Market Bistro. Once you find the entrance and park your car you walk up to a colorful patio decorated like you would see in a French painting by Claude Monet. You notice everyone there enjoying themselves with a glass of fine wine and a table full of tasty goodies. The inside is interestingly charming and colorfully decorated in the same eloquent fashion. Nice.  We got there early to avoid the crowds and it was perfect. We were also greeted instantly and told to sit wherever we wanted. The server showed up faster than if I had a magic wand. He informed us of the specials while he got our drink orders going as well as bringing us a complementary plate of some of the best tasting buttery croissants I have ever had before. We asked a few questions and he happily answered us with no hesitation and was most informative.  We started with the Smoked Salmon Quesadilla with Dill & Horseradish Cream for $10 and it was delicious. For entr√©es, the ladies ordered Saut√©ed Salmon with Herb Rice and Basil Beurre Blanc for $12.50 and Beef Bourguignon with Mashed Potatoes for $14. I selected the Seafood Skewer with Pesto Sauce and Scalloped Potatoes for $13 off the specials menu. We were all amazed at how nicely the vegetables were cooked just right. The fresh ingredients, textures and flavors were spectacular with all the dishes. Could not help asking for another plate of croissants to sop up all the extra juices and sauces since I was told by the wife not to lick the plate. When we thought we were done the server brings each of us a small plate of flourless chocolate cake topped with a mini scoop of vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. Yummo!  We had such a great time there and the bill was very reasonable for the quality of the food and the friendly service we received. We will definitely be coming back again sooner than later. Fantastique!"}
{"text":"On a Sunday morning in phoenix, you are often left thinking about the fact that a good breakfast is neither close nor available.  In fact, you could sum up the valleys breakfast nooks as vacant or un found.  There is one beacon of breakfast hope that can be found in the central corridor, and Vincents be thy name.  Obviously Vincents is a culinary staple in the valley that is known far and wide and adorned by all.  What is somewhat unknown to valley foodies is that right behind the main Vincents restaurant sits \"Vincents Bistro.\"  What does that mean to the food masses? The best price point in the valley on fine dining in a great setting.  Before you engage the menu, make sure to enjoy the house made croissants and butter, this little treat will get your senses going in the right direction.    The menu at the Bistro is not complex(neither is the main dining room), but has staples such as Vincents famous smoked salmon quesedilla($10) and main lobster with handmade basil pasta($14).  The Bistro has a daily prix fixe menu that uses the following methodology. An appetizer of choice, a main entree of choice and dessert.  The price tag is never greater than $20 for the prix fixe and I challenge another restaurant in the valley to beat it.  Choices can range from prime new york steak, to lamb chops to a wonderfully cooked piece of fish.   What are the cons? Good luck coordinating a take out order with the normal busyness of the operation.  Wait times for pick up can range from forty-five minutes to over an hour.  If you feel like your caught in the middle of a whirlwind circus when picking up your order, don't worry, that's just the normal pace.    In 1982 Vincent Guerithault catapulted Arizona into the beginning phases of the culinary elite the other larger metropolis cities were already enjoying.  Now, thirty years later, he has done it again with the Bistro.  I applaud Vincent and his family on their success and longevity in the valley culinary circuit."}
{"text":"This little place reminds me of what a true French bistro is like. I lived in Lyon as a kid for many years and the thing I miss the most about France is the gastronomy. When you walk in here, they give you free, homemade mini-croissants. Warm, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Just perfect. No matter what you order the food is amazing. The 3 times I've been there I have never been disappointed. Can't wait to go back!   My favorite so far (aside from the mini croissants) have been the moules with fries. So delicious!   Pour le propri√©taire du bistro, je vous √©cris un petit morceau en fran√ßais. Merci beaucoup pour un excellent bistro fran√ßais en Arizona, et j'esp√®re pouvoir visiter bient√¥t. F√©licitations !"}
{"text":"Our second time back within a week. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about dietary restrictions. We had no problem eating Gluten-Free. Plus, all of the food was amazing. Light on the beer list but have an extensive wine selection (including recorked wine from the 1920's)! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Their prix fixe menu gives almost unbelievable value on truly fine eats. Truly fine. And some nice-priced tasty wines. Not for the real snobs, maybe (they go to the fancy end of the building), but this place is absolutely one of the best of the best - I'd give it 6 stars if I could, and I eat out a lot and in many different places. Stop reading & get your tookis to Vincent's Bistro."}
{"text":"I read a lot of reviews for this place and I get a little perturbed. Slow service, overpriced, terrible wait staff...... When really people should be realizing this is not an American restaurant. This is a French bistro that happens to be in America. European style dining is extremely different than the American mentality of sit down, order your food, eat it and then leave. And if you want a larger menu, go to Denny's. No, no, no, my dear friend. Dining in Europe is an experience and one that is used to build relationships around the dinner table and to make memories. The service is slow for a reason. It will give you time to talk to each other. Enjoy the croissants. Look at the menu without having to tell the wait staff you need more time. This is closer to real customer service. When I come here, I know I need more time and I plan for it.  The food is exquisite. Perfect sized portions and perfect taste every time. I did not realize that I actually like butternut squash soup until I came here. Having brunch here is great also.  Each meal is finished off with more complimentary food. Whatever the kitchen decided to make that day for dessert with one scoop of refreshing ice cream.  If I were to give one criticism of this place it would be the parking. There is just not enough of it sometimes because the other foodies will agree that this place is worth it."}
{"text":"We like to go our of our way to try and find F&B venues of all types; from the down and dirty, the hip and trendy, the cosy and quaint to the greasy and Pepto Bismally......  But I'm always intrigued when we arrive to a new town, to see where locals like to go and eat.. now usually, that really does mean a take out burger joint or a greasy spoon.  But in the case of the vast Phoenix sprawl with its inorganic population growth, (basically it's three major cities shoved into one) you've got an ever evolving diaspora of generational clusters with it's own microcosm of habitual norms...  The easiest way to observe the human condition is in it's eating habits; we had the pleasure of staying in the Scottsdale area this time, where an intimate little outpost of a Bistro bustles like a hive, hidden away from it's older, larger sibling, Vincent's on Camelback.   Click below to read more...                       When you're on Camelback Rd, you likely to see Vincent's on Camelback first facing the street.  It's an older, established restaurant in Scottsdale which has slightly faded from the limelight, with a loyal following of astute and mature clientele who enjoy French Cuisine.    Veering right into the driveway, you're bound to think that you would be entering into the main building (there's really no defined indication on navigating this place) but Vincent's Market Bistro is actually a separate venue all together with it's own quaint casual identity.    Actually, it's a tricky venue, the awning and front foliage is the only indication of it's presence and with a side entrance, it's hard to see inside to confirm that it's open... But once inside, you see a whole different world...  It's by definition, a quintessential Bistro from Provence; Venetian plastered walls drenched in Sunflower Gold, color ridden tablecloths with Wooden chairs and mirrored ceiling with stencils and faux wood beams; this restaurant is the Disneyland of Bistro hodge podge...but I like it a lot!  What really got me at hello was the plate of home baked Croissants with Strawberry Jam delivered to our table; not entirely Bistro protocol, but at that point, who cared?  I mean, is there any wrong occasion for buttery Croissants?? It was devoured immediately, only to be refilled instantaneously, like a buttery Croissant Genie popped and gave us three wishes!!!  What was true to it essence was the menu: I found old favorites like Coq au Vin and Country Quiche.  And the price point was definitely not French!  The Coq au Vin was too irresistible to pass up, and when it came to our table, it delivered as promised; a wonderfully rich Bourgogne sauce covered Chicken leg on top of an equally decadent mound of Mashed Potatoes.  With portions that would satisfy the French diet, the rich dish sated our American belly...  And looking at the other tables, it seemed that it did equally well around the room...   And what would be a price fix course at Vincent's without our knowledge, a complimentary dessert arrived.  It was really cute actually, the whole experience-kinda felt transported into the surreal Hybrid of French American cuisine...  All in all, Vincent's is a great place for Lunch where you can escape the brutal Phoenix sun and stay, cool and relaxed in the French countryside for the afternoon.

{"text":"Drove 30 minutes with a full car of family members just to see a tiny sign posted \"summer hours\"... closed!!!... if you change your hours then notify yelp and other agencies you work with so people aren't misinformed about your establishment, otherwise it just leaves a bad taste in their mouth."}
{"text":"We came here last Thursday to celebrate my grandmother's birthday and we were able to reserve the back room. They were able to accommodate our extra guest and the wait staff was very friendly (and funny!)  Personally, I had the rainbow trout and potatoes with Reisling and Pinot Grigio. It's a pricier place (not as pricy as Vincent's on Camelback), but well worth it!  The food and wine were phenomenal and a good time was had by all!"}
{"text":"If you love French cooking, Vincents Bistro has a wonderful array of brunch and lunch selections.  Firstly, their coffee is heavenly.  Many tables at our Sunday brunch were ordering from the drink menu.  I had the poached eggs florentine, which was very good.  My husband had an omelet with ham and gruyere cheese but did share later that it was overcooked and the gruyere was almost absence.  The buttery rolls they serve before the meal are delicious--hot and fresh from the oven.  They give everyone a complimentary small dessert after your meal.  Our table had a selection of a fresh brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, a lemon bar with blueberries and creme brulee.  Their creme brulee is to die for!  The restaurant is frequented by a lot of old times--I imagine they've been heading to Vincents for many, many years.  The service is excellent and the wait staff seems to know a lot of the patrons.  Overall, the restaurant prices are very reasonable, especially given the warm rolls and a complimentary dessert.  However, the sound level can be quite loud at times, and there is a real need for some updating of their restaurant's decor.  If you don't mind these last two elements, the food and service will rarely disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Though it tends to be a bit crowded not to mention noisy... but the food is just about the best you can get in town for the price... It's not cheap, but it's also not super pricey.  I've been here about half a dozen times now and would definitely repeat."}
{"text":"I love Vincent and Leevon! I have been going here for at least 8 years and feel like I am at home every time I return.  The hot chocolate is magnificent. The spinach quiche is the best I have ever had. Coq Au van is my all time comfort food. It is so savory and tender. Allow yourself time to relax and enjoy your meal if you can. Other wise it is still worth it just to pop in for a bite."}
{"text":"Cute little bistro with fantastic meals.  Whether it be brunch or dinner this place truly is a gem for french cuisine. I usually get the course dinner at a fixed price cause it's so good and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! The food was outstanding, the portions perfect, and the service excellent! Can't wait to go back soon :)"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here for my mother's birthday.  The bread was the best I have ever had, and they gave us two plates of it!  I had the ravioli and my mother had salmon on a bed of rice with cream sauce.  I had a bite of hers and loved the flavors!  Dad had a salad with a lobster bisque, I had a bowl too, and it was wonderfully creamy.  The great thing was the salad came with two poached eggs which gave it a good portion size.  The best part was they gave us three free desserts!  One was flourless chocolate cake, another berry, and the third apple, all with a little dollop of ice cream.  It was a lovely meal."}
{"text":"There's an interesting trend developing among some of the valley's most popular fine dining establishments.  As a way of getting more customers in the door, they are offering smaller menus consisting of more economical dishes almost as an introduction to their unique cuisine.  Binkley's now has numerous Cafe Bink locations that offer this experience and others are following suit.  Including, apparently, Vincent Guerithault.  I have to give HUGE props to my date for discovering this spot that I never knew even existed until tonight.  I've been to Vincent On Camelback more than once and was a little nervous when she told me she wanted Vincent for dinner.  I know their food is good, but pretty spendy.  But before I could raise an objection she mentioned they now have a bistro offering a cheaper menu next door.  Wha?  Sure enough I met her here after work for dinner and as I traverse the narrow parking lot past Vincent's mothership, there's the bistro.  A small nook tucked in the middle of an already tucked away restaurant.  The bistro has a small outdoor patio with the rest of the dining area opening up to the patio.  On a perfect weather evening like tonight, its a great indoor/outdoor setup.  Altogether the bistro can seat somewhere around 25-30 people tops.  Not big, but not cramped either.  The walls, the paintings, and the music still feel like Vincent, but in a much more relaxed casual setup.  The menu offers one of three different dining options.  You can order a la carte, a $25 prix fixe menu consisting of three courses (which change everyday), or you can order from their menu of pizzas.  The pizzas seem a little out of place here since the theme is predominantly French, but I didn't order those so that's neither here nor there.  The prix fixe menu had some interesting options that evening, but there was one a la carte dish that immediately caught my attention.  Duck confit.  When done right, duck confit is amazing as I've had a ridiculously good duck confit dish at Zinc Bistro in Scottsdale.  The dish here was served with lentils and bacon.  The duck was tender and the meat fell off the bone with ease.  The savoriness of the duck and the heartiness of the bacon paired tremendously and the portion was just the right size.  Prior to the main event, we split a three cheese tarine.  Essentially a plate of three cheese bruschetta.  The bread slices weren't big, but super rich.  Paired very well with the wines we had.  We actually didn't order dessert, but we each got a chocolate brownie piece with vanilla bean ice cream on the house.  A tasty way to top off the night and oh yeah it was complimentary!  Our server was extremely polite and soft spoken and the pace of the meals were spot on.  Both of us left full, but not uncomfortably so.  All totaled, two glasses of wine, the bruschetta appetizer, a pair of main courses, two desserts, and tip was $70.  Far cheaper than Vincent's parent restaurant, while still offering the quality service, ambience, and flavors that Vincent is known for.  I would still recommend Vincent's parent restaurant for the ultimate French cuisine experience as their dishes are even more imaginative.  But for those looking to just dip their toes into Vincent's menu or looking for a cheaper alternative, the Bistro makes for a tremendous plan B."}
{"text":"Visited Vincent's today with a local resident. Ate breakfast out on the patio. It was delightful. They were willing to make an omelet for me that wasn't on the menu. Very impressive and I would go back. Service was outstanding."}
{"text":"Vincent's was my third restaurant week stop for Spring 2014, and is a five star but my restaurant week visit was a bit of a bummer.  Their food is fantastic. Their service is fantastic. It is an expensive restaurant, with the entrees in the mid thirties each, but worth every penny. I hate spending a lot of money and leaving a place underwhelmed, but I'll happily spend it at a place like this!  On the down side, this is the only restaurant this week, so far, that when I told them I wouldn't be eating dessert, they didn't sub out something else. I forgive them a bit considering of all the places, they are taking the biggest hit in terms of average revenue per table during restaurant week, but let me compare this to two years ago...  Two years ago a fourth guest spontaneously joined my table of three. Then she said she wasn't eating, she just wanted to hang out... I was a bit embarrassed by this, but said nothing. Then she started to eat off of everyone's plates! During restaurant week, that's completely unacceptable, and they could have been quite justified in charging us a plate sharing fee (which this year is $20).  Instead, Vincent's showed their incredible finesse and taste. They brought her an empty plate to make her food stealing easier! Then, at dessert time, they didn't ask what we wanted, they just bought one of each of the four available desserts! They said, \"well there were four of you, so we just thought you would like one of each.\" Even though she didn't pay a dime. This was a deeply classy way to say we see what you are doing but will not stoop to your level...  I left a large tip (about 33%), and have told countless people about how Vincent's is the number one date place on my list for great food and service above and beyond any I've ever seen.  So this year (my sixth time going, three during restaurant week, three regular visits), it was really disappointing that they didn't even try to be creative with me. And no, it was not busy when we were there. I almost feel like the waitress didn't even ask or something and made the call herself.  I bet a manager would have come to explain if they had made that call. The difference between two years ago was a real disappointment.  But what I did eat was of course fantastic. The lobster roll was perfect on a slightly sweet roll, the ravioli was delicious and delicate. Just what I expected.  So I am only rating them four stars for this review for their lack of empathy and creativity, and for being less amazing than they used to be. But it really is my favorite date place so maybe next year, I'll give them the star back."}
{"text":"Vincent's market on Saturdays is packed full of wonderful gifts to purchase & oh the food...my crepe I am told was made by Vincent's son ...perfect savory brunch!  Friends had two different fabulous souffl√©s  wow..they nailed it!!  Tried the top of a pizza - beautiful thin crust yet very garlicky. Overall great job!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE restaurant in Phoenix. Cannot wait to go back. Service, food and ambiance and price for what you get ( price fix menu) were great. The only small issue was that it was really packed with people & some of the people in wheelchairs/walkers had a tough time getting through. They even have a cookbook!"}
{"text":"Took my 17 year old granddaughter for lunch- she went to France in the spring so we thought we would give this a try.  She had the special of mussels and frites-gigantic mussels in a beautiful wine sauce. I had the coq au vin- was delicious with deep flavors- good size portion - so good I got an order to go for my husbands dinner.  Service was great, ambience cheerful and just what we hoped for-nice touch of complimentary croissants and jam at start then complimentary dessert of three different sweets- a chocolate mousse, vanilla custard and apple tart wth vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce.  Will go back very soon!"}
{"text":"Adorable atmosphere, delicious food, and great service. We had a lovely date night here. We ate off the prix fixe menu. The highlights were the sole/sea bass and the strawberry cobbler, but everything was tasty.The icing on the cake was how reasonably priced our meal was."}
{"text":"Not the easiest to find, this is definitely more of a locals restaurant. My wife and I went for dinner, which I believe to be a less busier time. There was still a small crowd, but no wait. The food was good, although for this price, I could have expected better. The little croissants they give you, along with the small, free dessert at the end, made up for the average food.  Really though, it was the service and the atmosphere that were amazing and that made this place stick out from your typical restaurant. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Last Thursday, my husband and I visited this establishment and were pleasantly surprised.  The staff were well trained and didn't falter even when there were a lot of demands on them from hungry customers. The croisants that were served rather quickly were warm, buttery and very hard to resist. We both chose the Prix Fixe dinner.  My husband had the mushroom raviolis which were served in a rich sauce and were very flavorful.  I had the caesar salad which was a little larger than I expected, but it could have used a little more dressing.  The lamb dinner consisted of four perfectly prepared chops, along with potatoes  dauphinois and snap peas.  For our dessert course I chose the Profiterole which is a tower of small, ice cream filled puff pastries.  This was good.  My husband ordered the peach tart and was somewhat disappointed.  The peaches were not as tender as they could have been.  This may have been due to re-heating the pastry. My husband and several of the \"regulars\" we spoke to agreed that Vincent Market Bistro serves some of the best lamb served in the valley. On our next visit, we will arrive around 5:30 instead of 6:30 to avoid the crowd.  The regulars park just to the west of the Bistro when the free parking spots are filled.  The wine can be a bit pricey so check the price before ordering.  Be prepared to be in rather tight quarters with a rather high noise level.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had never been to a French restaurant before, so I don't know how authentic it is, but as a restaurant in general, it was excellent. The food was wonderful, the atmosphere was quiet and relaxing, and the service was amazing. I came in basically half-dehydrated. I practically drank a gallon, and our server never even let my glass get less than a quarter of the way full. Not pushy or anything. We even got a brownie dessert compliments the chef. Great dining experience overall!"}
{"text":"I had been to Vincent's Market Bistro many moons ago for lunch and decided to make date night there for dinner recently...what a nice surprise!  The atmosphere is so laid back, but with the same professional service as next door.  The food is truly amazing, the right portion sizes and so reasonably priced.  We enjoyed the beef bourguignon, the pork loin with gratin dauphinois and a medley of the three desserts (apple tart, blueberry tart and creme caramel)...so amazing!  We will definitely be back...maybe for paella night next time."}
{"text":"I've come here quite a few times now, mostly for lunch. Each time I go, I get excited to see the daily lunch specials they offer. I've ordered the lamb shank, lobster quiche and beef bourguignon. They all have been really good. To accompany the meal they also offer free croissants that are served with a raspberry preserve before the meal and a small dessert at the end. Although the prices of the lunch special have steadily gone up from $10 since the first time I've been here, I think the quality of the food and the ambiance is still worth every penny."}
{"text":"we were going to give la grande orange a whirl on sunday for breakfast but the noise and confusion chased us away so we look at are yelp on the old smart phone and saw vincents was open for breakfast ....score a nice quaint charming spot free mini crosants moist with butter a good menu and delightful service we will return for dinner and breakfast again soon"}
{"text":"My favorite neighborhood restaurant in Arcadia! My husband and I went here once a week when we lived in Phoenix. The French cuisine is wonderful. I love the pull-apart croissants that they give you while you for your meal, and the Coq Au Vin is my favorite dish. My husband usually goes for the lamb shank and has never been disappointed. The service is friendly and quirky here, too, which I love. A much more relaxed environment from the fine dining room they share a kitchen with -- an environment I much prefer!"}
{"text":"Great little hideaway.  Been here for lunch and brunch and every time it's consistently good food and service.  A regular in the rotation..."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Mar 28, 2015 and it was absolutely amazing.  The food, as all the reviews here have said, is wonderful, and our waiter Elijah was attentive and efficient, as well as helping to make our evening a lot of fun with his outgoing, positive personality and his showmanship while serving.  Between my wife and me, we had the lobster quiche and the mixed seafood skewer, and both were excellent. Before this meal, I had evidently never eaten a real quiche, as the lobster quiche was above and beyond what I had previously thought of as quiche.  It's that good.  We also split a margherita pizza for an appetizer, which was good but not something I would say is a must-have.  Contrary to what Dick G. mentioned about parking in his review, we self-parked in the lot behind the restaurant, and there were no fees.  Perhaps he went the valet route?"}
{"text":"French restaurant. Friendly atmosphere, food is ok. Nothing fancy or delectable."}
{"text":"Why would anybody wait for Restaurant Week when Vincent Market Bistro is priced better than Restaurant Week every day!  Vincent Market Bistro is a Comfortable Casual French Style Bistro that offers exceptional service and delicious French Style Food with South West Style accents. It doesn't matter if you order off the $25. Prix Fixe 3 Course Menu or the A La Carte Menu your not going to spend much either way. Everyone here drinks wine you either order a glass or two or a bottle. The other thing to keep in mind is that there is no late night here I think they stop serving around 8pm.  I've been here a bunch of times and all the food is always fantastic! They always start you off with Buttery Fresh Croissants on super adorable plates. I particularly enjoy steak here more than anyplace else because it's always delicious and not too big of a portion. I also always enjoy the fresh seafoods they offer that usually come with a Basil Beurre Blanc Sauce. My husband thinks the Duck Confit and the lamb are better and more enjoyable here than most others he has tried. No matter what you order it will be delicious with fresh herbs and properly prepared.   The desserts are always delicious and are worth the calories.  The Service here is always very professional and warm.  I always enjoy every dinner from Vincent Market Bistro.  As a slight update 6-1-15 the Prix 3 course is now $29.00 and is still terrific!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at the Bistro is a relaxed culinary treat.  Mini-croissants led a tasty path to a finely crafted \"toads in the hole\"; poached eggs nestled inside a slice of brioche, covered by a bechamel sauce  and crossed with bacon.  Very good!  Best was the service.  Unobtrusive, observant and efficient.  Well worth the drive across town."}

{"text":"This last week, I had my girlfriends surprise birthday party at Vincent's Market Bistro. The food, the atmosphere, and the service were all great. As everyone else mentioned, the croissants they serve are delicious, and very euro like.  The menu is somewhat limited, but they also had a pre fixe menu for dinner which is a great option as well.  The atmosphere is very cozy, and has a great euro feel to it. What I was most impressed with was the service. Our waiter was very knowledgable and patient.  But the thing that really sealed the deal was the cute little birthday dessert they made for my girlfriend, only to be shortly followed with a similar complimentary plate for everyone else at the table.  We will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding! Great deal for french country bistro food. Very reasonable pricing, $20 for 3 course menu or order a la carte even cheaper.  I am the youngest person in there by about 40 years every time I go but I don't care, I don't know anywhere else in the valley that has the same combo of charm, service, food quality, and cheap prices as this place.  Is the food culinary magic? NO, but who would expect it to be at $20 for 3 courses?  Are portions huge? NO, but you can't even get out of cheesecake factory at that price (not that I'd want 3 courses at cheesecake, but you get the idea...).  Unfortunately word is getting out and it is getting more and more crowded every time I go!! Great part is they will sometimes allow overflow to sit in one of the actual Vincent's dining rooms which instantly expands seating!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! There is a reason it has been around as long as it has!  I have nothing bad to say about this place... At all!  The service was fantastic.  The food left me wanting to lick my plate.  The goat cheese nachos were to die for, the lamb chops ere some of the best we have had.  The wine was intoxicating and when we mentioned it was our first time there the waiter brought us out a couple different desserts to try!    I will go back again, and again, and again!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was here for restaurant week and i really wasn't impressed. I mean dont get me wrong, its not bad but it does not stand out. The service was neither here nor there, the wait staff was polite and courteous but I think they were stretched a bit thin that day possibly. The food was not really anything I would pay anywhere close to what they would have charged. The food just tasted bland and lacked flavour or zest of any kind. The dessert was exceedingly good , and was the best part of the meal. All things said and done at their price point, there are better options than this"}
{"text":"The Saturday Marketplace is quite interesting. In a good way it's like seeing a live menu up and down the parking lot.. and everything is fresh to order yum yum highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sure you'll have to deal with the surly old Paradise Valley women that prowl the tables and the service takes a long moment to warm up but there aren't too many dinners that offer as much for the value.    Great French inspired dining at a reasonable price.  The croissant freebies are a great way to win loyal customers.  The Prix Fixe menu is the best way to sample the menu."}
{"text":"Wow!! Just Wow!! How did I miss this little Gem!! I'm upset with my friends that have been here and not hooked a girl up!! I'm a giver so....Come Here!!! The atmosphere is like a charming French bistro! The server Brittany was Superb! Helpful, patient and suggestions from the menu!! The meals were amazing! We had quiche and we order two different ones to share! You're given generous portions....but here is the Kicker!!  Free croissants while you wait for your entrees....wait for it....And a little baby dessert as well!!! What!!! Free Yummy Stuff...it's True!! Don't be a fool and miss out on this darling place for brunch with the girls or a romantic moment with your man!! Vincent...I'm in Love!!!"}
{"text":"Loved having brunch here! Cute little French Bistro! The service was spectacular! We had Luke and he was very attentive and personable! They give you free croissants with jam to start your brunch! The croque madame was spectacular and it reminded me of the one I ate in Paris. They end your meal with free dessert. I had a berry tart and it was delicious! We are definitely keeping this restaurant on our go to brunch list."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!  French bistro food at a reasonable price - gratis dessert and croissants.  Simple, casually elegant, a little noisy - and by all means yummy.  Its really hard to not like the offerings.     This gets 5 stars for filling a really awesome niche in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, and so I have had the good fortune of having Vincents Market Bistro in my backyard. Without exageration I have probably eaten here at least 50 times over the years and have NEVER had a disappointing meal.   From the egg-in-a-hole for breakfast to the lovely Coq au vin , lamb shank, or Beef Bourguignon for lunch or dinner the menu is always rich.   My Top 5 Reasons I Love Vincent's Market Birsto  ~ Lovely lovely food. Way way above the ordinary. ~ Price. You can expect to pay $7 - $10 bucks a plate. ~ Location.........40th & Camelback ~ Service. Always cordial, and always snappy. Always  ~ Free desert. Usually a small slice of fruit tart with a scoop of vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"Although I haven't had the pleasure of dining at Vincent's of Camelback, I became a fan of his little brother, Vincent Market Bistro, after just one visit.  Although I thought there were a few too many tables in this small space, I still found it cozy and intimate.  I had a hard time deciding between trying a pizza (the Four Cheese had my attention with mozzarella, bleu, brie, and goat cheeses with pesto) or a full-blown dinner (particularly the Shrimp Crepe with avocado corn salsa).  But the Prix Fixe won with three courses for a very reasonable price ($25 I think).    They allowed me to substitute lobster bisque for the soup offered, and it was very rich, and buttery, and lobstery.  The halibut/sea bass duo was my preferred entree.  Perfectly cooked, perfectly sized given it was sandwiched between a cream soup and dessert.  The pot de creme was surprisingly and pleasantly, not chocolate.  Although I like chocolate, I prefer it as an element of a dessert, not the main ingredient.  Only \"getting too old to remember shit\" me can't remember the flavor..I believe it was raspberry.  What I do remember is that it was very good.  Our server was delightful in responding to our 101 questions about the menu.  It was a lovely meal overall.  Note to self:  go back soon."}
{"text":"They got me at Free dessert : ) This is a very quaint place with a small parking lot. I am curious to stop by for breakfast, for our son recommended for dinner and it was a very pleasant surprise.  They open with warm croissants, and the service was prompt and friendly. I had the beef bourguignon and I was very pleased. The other's in my party had the lamb shank and did enjoy it a lot as well.  I was interested in the specials but have not had a chance to come back to try other items in the menu.  At the end of our meal, it was a nice surprise that our sever brought small portion of desserts to out table. They were delicious. I am sure the fact that they were included/complimentary makes them taste a tad better : ) what a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Gotta give it 5 stars.  I wouldn't change a thing about it, from the ambience to the server to the food quality.   To start, like a reviewer said before me, the valet parking does seem to be for the actual Vincent restaurant, rather than for the Bistro.  And yes, there is parking in the back.  **Another note**:  The Market Bistro only takes reservations for parties of 5 or more.  Two of us went at 7:00 on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately.  What we ate that we actually ordered:  Lobster bisque, salmon quesadillas, coq au vin, seafood skewers.  What the server brought-- for free for us to try-- which we ate but hadn't ordered:  The butternut squash ravioli, mini pumpkin chocolate brownie with ice cream on top.  (And of course the mini croissants at the beginning of the meal.)  Everything we ate was beyond fantastic, with one exception-- the seafood skewers were a little bland.  Not \"bad\" by any means, just not as flavorful as seafood can be.  The real standout was the butternut squash.  Our second favorite was the salmon quesadillas.  EXCELLENT.  Even better:  our entire bill, including my friend's glass of wine and my soft drink, was $48!!  I will go back again and again.  (And to all you thriving young bucks, this would be the perfect place to take a first date-- classy and unique, yet unpretentious, with amazing food and a manageable cost.  Score!)"}
{"text":"We thought this was a market/bistro, but it turns out the market is only open on Saturdays, like a farmer's market. But we were hungry, so we stopped in for brunch. Place was jumping, full of locals and the noise level was pretty high due to a few big tables.  Wife ordered the cheese plate, I got the scrambled eggs with cream cheese and smoked slamon. Cheese plate was okay, but the toast points were like croutons, instead of grilled bread. Nothing but crunch.  Scrambled eggs were just that, a good helping of scrambled eggs piled on top of a dollop of cream cheese and some diced up smoke salmon hiding under there, too. Overall, kind of meh.  The complimentary crossiants we got to start, though, are worth a return visit. Butter would be better than the thin blueberry syrup/compote they came with, but they were great!  The server brought us a couple of desserts to try. The apple pie was good, the rum pudding was way too sweet for our taste.  If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd probably try it again and go for dinner. But I don't live in the neighborhood.  TIP: Looks like parking is at a premium here, so plan accordingly"}

{"text":"Welcome to Paris in the desert. Je t'aime Vincent's. Anything Vincent's does I love. Whether it's the 5 star dining in the front, the market bistro in the back or the Saturday morning marketplace outside. They really know how to frenchafy AZ.   I've been to Vincent's Market Bistro several times and most recently, last night for a friend's birthday. The Market Bistro is the more intimate, kitchen style dining at Vincent's and actually my favorite way to dine there. I walked in and immediately felt like I'd entered a cozy and intimate restaurant in the heart of Paris. The food was cooking, the guests at the tables were laughing and having a great time and the waitstaff knew almost everyone by name. The authentic french decor helped the cause as well.   When I hear the name Vincent's, I immediately think \"oh yikes, here comes a pricey night,\" but the best part about it is that the market bistro keeps the evening at an incredibly reasonable price without losing the quality of food. Are you ready for this? I got the pre fix meal that began with a delectable crab cake on a salad with avocado garnish, followed by the lobster chimichanga and topped off with the chocolate tart which was really a chocolate souffle. How much? $20. Only $20 my friends! It was delicious. With each savory bite, I became a little happier. The wine by the glass was only $5-$6 dollars and at the end, the waiter brought us a couple additional desserts to make sure we tried them all. Just what my waistline needed...but I had a bite, and I think the lemon tart is my favorite.   Vincent's Market Bistro has definitely been added to the rotation of favorite places to dine with character. And when I walked outside and the heat hit my face, I didn't even mind because I had such a great time at Vincent's."}
{"text":"Id love to share with you my new go-to date night spot. It's filled with so much charm and romance we both were simply glowing with post dinner elation. The place, Vincent's Market Bistro is the scaled down version of the fine dining classic Vincent's of Camelback. It's funny that a place like this is so well hidden without even a hint of signage beyond a sandwich board on the street. Just look for the main Vincent's sign and follow it around back to the Market Bistro entrance, they're housed in the same building.   Chef and owner Vincent Guerithault keeps the menu decidedly French with hints of Southwestern flare that he's so famous for. You should look this guy up; he's got some accolades including a James Beard award under his belt. Does kudos translate to good cookery, you bet!   For one of my favorites, be sure to look for the Curly Endive Salad ($9) with mustard dressing, bacon, and a poached egg. I saw it, I ordered it, I swooned over it. A well balanced ratio of salty, sweet and sour then fresh cracked pepper completes the equation.   Pizza offerings are done well with a tender pale crust that seemed more akin to pastry then to your typical chewy crispy offering. Tarte Flamb√©e ($8) was topped with a light cream sauce, bacon, onion and thyme. Another pork laden pizza was the Caprese ($8) topped with pesto, arugula, mozzarella and prosciutto. I just wished that the greens were put on after cooking instead of before.  For dinner you'll find classics including the cooked in its own fat Crispy Duck Confit ($16) with lentils and bacon, sensing a porky theme here? The tender mallard leg was succulent and intense in flavor while the lentils performed well by countering the richness of the meat. For something a little bit lighter, I use that word loosely, order up the Coq au Vin ($10). Red wine braised chicken served atop gratin potatoes were hearty and comforting.   Vincent's Market Bistro also offers a $20, 3 course Prix Fixe menu. On my last visit delights were abound with the likes of creamy Butternut Squash Ravioli, Rainbow Trout and a scrumptiously sour Lemon Tart. This has to be one of the best deals in town that I know of. I mean really, food from a James Beard award winning chef at these prices is unheard of.   Great food, good prices and excellent service all set in a romantic atmosphere, well; there is one caveat, the hours. Vincent's Market Bistro closes at 8pm, so plan on eating early. We arrived around 6pm on a Saturday night and by 7pm the place was completely filled. Be sure to check their website for times including breakfast, brunch and lunch."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service from Scott and team!  Special Beef Wellington was fantastic"}
{"text":"This is one of my go-to places for a great brunch! They always have an nice selection of delicious food. The service is always attentive and friendly. It can get fairly busy later in the morning, so if you're not into that go early. I have eaten here at least 15 times and have never been disappointed in anything. I love this place! I should also mention that the Saturday market is INCREDIBLE!! The food stations offer something for everyone. Local merchants hawk their wares at their stands and they always have a funky older guy tickling the ivories on his keyboard. This is a mini festival of food and fun and is a MUST do for anyone wanting to impress out of town guests. It happens every Saturday from about 9am-2pm from October until May. Be sure to park in the business lot west of the 7-11. 7-11 plaza will charge you $5. The business lot for Shamrock Foods is free parking and only a short walk."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Great food,  amazing customer service,  love how intimate it feels. Somepeople may be uncomfortable with how close you are to other tables but I love it! The croissants are super yummy,  they are small and keep on coming.  The brunch menu is my favorite, at the end they bring you a complementary desert, which just makes the whole experience that much better.  Saturdays they have a farmers market-sort of,  in the parking lot. Definetly check it out.  Good for a date,  romantic dinner,  brunch with gals."}
{"text":"This is a great French restaurant, with quaint decor, fast service and excellent food. We had the \"egg in a hole \" and \"ratatouille omelette\"  both were excellent and worth the trip from the east valley."}
{"text":"The service here was great! The lobster bisque and dessert were amazing. Other members of our group enjoyed the lamb shank, duck confit and rack of lamb."}
{"text":"Employer dinner at this establishment.  Although the menu was pre-set, I was able to taste other co-worker's entrees.  The crab cake salad was delicious.  The Halibut entree I ordered was perfect.  The decor on the plate (presentation) was great.  The servers were excellent!  I will return to this restaurant again to experience other items I was not able to taste."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere - European feel, cute, quaint, not too stuffy.  Great place for a date. The prices aren't bad and the food is good, although the portions can be small.  How amazing the food is really depends on the menu of the evening, though I have not had anything bad.  Everything has been at least good, and some things excellent.  Service has also been great.  Plus, I like the prix fixe menu."}
{"text":"A fantastic evening dinner and dessert while in town for business. Thank you for great service!  Thank you Chef Vincent!!"}
{"text":"Cute little place that's been here for so long it's easy to forget.  We were in for a weekday breakfast and had a great time.  Their lattes were delicious and they offered us free croissants and jam.  I had the poached eggs and toast and my girlfriend had an omelette. Both were absolutely fantastic.  She had ordered avocado on the side when she ordered her omelette and that came out about five minutes after the eggs.  The building certainly has some deferred maintenance and that detracted from the ambiance to a small degree."}
{"text":"My experience at Vincents was truly excellent. I went in the middle of the week during a decently busy time and was seated very quickly at a nice table for two near the back.   I have never been to France but I think that this is what it would feel like. Great decor, wine bottles being opened frequently, and excellent food that I can't pronounce.   I had the Duck Confit and loved it. The duck had a nice skin on it and it was presented on top of a bed of lentils that complimented the richness of the Duck very nicely. The house salad was crisp and fresh and the dessert, which was brought out for free, was a delight.  Had the privilege of meeting both the manager and the head chef and can say that both are wonderful people who are passionate about giving great experiences and great food.   Be aware that there are no reservations for small parties but I can't think of a better place for a great date that won't break the bank.   Be sure to check out their website for a list of what is on the menu because it does change from time to time."}
{"text":"They gave free croissants and desert which was nice. The atmosphere was good. The food fell short of expectation but I guess this is subjective."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time here for Sunday brunch with 4 gf's and as you know when girls get together for brunch there are 2 staples talking and pagne. Both were flowing for 2 hours and never once did we feel rushed.   Our drinks were never empty, we got 2nds of the delectable mini croissants and I didn't want to leave.   I ordered the egg in a whole while my friend next to be had the panini.  Both tasted light, fresh and not too large on the portion size.  I will be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I am amazed....the foregoing reviews cannot possibly be speaking of the restaurant we visited during restaurant week.  We had 7.30 pm reservations and arrived on time to find probably 12 guests standing around waiting for their tables....we joined them. My husband became bored and walked around the small place, counting 10 tables waiting to be cleared.  20 minutes later, no one had offered us a drink, no cocktail serving person was to be seen, but at last we were seated! 15 more minutes passed slowly by. No acknowledgement of our presence...no welcoming smiles,hellos,eye contact.....ah at last water was poured into our glasses.Yes, there is some liquid refreshment available in this arid place.....WATER! Still no acknowledgement. The water bearer was silent and did not look up from his task......hello here's the waiter asking us for our order......er,\"may we see the menu first?\". Do you serve drinks in this restaurant?  May we order something to drink? Yes we had to ask.   Let's speak briefly about the food.  SALAD.......a salty undressed mess, Brie and figs......NO FIGS. Tomato leek tartlet....very good.  Filet steaks....tasteless. Lobster and pasta.....it wasn't lobster it was langoustine.....no flavor.  Salmon....ok. As for the desserts great pecan pie, ruined by pouring caramel sauce over it.  We all know that pecan pie is sweet enough, don't we?  After all this, the final straw was the very annoying waiter, who hummed incessantly as he served.  In all fairness he was totally unaware of his habit, as was everyone else who worked there....otherwise surely he would have been told to STOP. No we will not be returning.  So many great restaurants in the camelback corridor....why would we?"}
{"text":"This review is for the farmers market.  I was thrilled to meet a friend here for coffee and crepes.  I loved the outdoor environment with options to shop, eat and relax.  The ambiance reminded me of time I've spent in France.  In my opinion, I believe this setting is the closest you can get to being in France in AZ.  I was impressed with the variety of food options at the market including paella, crepes, omelettes and pastries.  It is an intimate setting, so be prepared to share a table and meet new people if it is crowded.  I think this part reminded me of France as well.  :)  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I just tried mussels and french fries. It was perfect. The creamy sauce was perfect also. It's real part of France, you could find here."}
{"text":"I was being treated to a Mother's day dinner by my younger Sis, along with my older Sis.  Vincents was the perfect place to go.   The lobster bisque = 10 stars!! It was soo amazing! Rich, sinful, oohhh....  Tomato and cheese salad also, very wonderful. The olive oil was the best I have ever tasted.   I had the lamb shank, and it was cooked perfectly, the potatoes were good, but the sauce threw me a little, I don't know how or why, but it was like the same smell as spaghetti-Os sauce!! haha! I know it obviously was not, but that is how my brain registered it.   My older Sis had the duck with bacon lentils, she was in heaven.  My younger Sis had the Pizza/Tarte with bacon, thyme and onions, it was very very very good.  I would go back for that and the bisque and the salad.    The deserts were good, not great, but a nice sweet way to end our meal.  I liked the peach tart.  The service was some of the best as well, honestly, they made our meal more enjoyable."}
{"text":"My mother loves French food. After reading nice Yelp reviews, I decided to take her here for her birthday dinner. I am very happy to have stumbled upon this treasure! We arrived on a Saturday at 5:45pm with no wait (but completely filled up shortly thereafter). We were immediately seated. Seating is offered inside or outside on a small patio. Dress is nicely casual. You can self-park or pay for a $4 valet in the same lot. The interior is decorated quaintly with a classic French bistro decor. It feels warm and cozy inside. As soon as we were seated we were greeted with ice water and a plate of small, warm, buttery croissants (complimentary). The menu is simple but with a nice selection to meet any taste you have for a meal.  Selections of beef, lamb, fish, crepes, et. were all available. For $13 you can order a special (choice of about 5 entrees) or for $25 you can order the prix fixe which is your choice (from 3 pre-selected) starter, entr√©e and dessert. My mom ordered a shrimp crepe which was delicious. The sauce was decadently rich- real French food. I ordered one of their specials- a seafood skewer. My plate came with salad, roasted vegetables and the skewer. Everything was very fresh and cooked just right. My father was the only one of us who selected a prix fixe. He chose the mushroom ravioli, peppered steak, and bread pudding for dessert. We had a glass water bottle with deliciously fresh, cool water always on our table. We never ran out of warm croissants. I tried some of my dad's bread pudding and we all agreed it was the best we had ever tasted. All of the staff were exceptionally attentive, polite and helpful. Our waiter was wonderful. It was a very nice dinner and great choice for a birthday. We will certainly return."}
{"text":"I don't even want to post about it (ha) because it's the best little secret gem of a lunch restaurant. DELICIOUS warm mini croissants and fresh berry preserves upon seating, lots of great French dishes to choose from, and a complimentary surprise dessert each time. The staff is lovely, the atmosphere is charming. It's like a little mini vacation to France."}
{"text":"I was visiting my friend in Phoenix and we used yelp to find a French restaurant and so glad we picked this one!  We went for brunch and I was really craving quiche, so I chose a ham quiche and also Vincent's panini. My friend is vegan and she asked server some questions about modifying what she wanted to order and server was so nice and accommodating! If he wasn't sure about something, he made sure to go ask the chef and check to see if it can be done and it didn't matter how many questions we had. He is from Mauritius so I ended up speaking a bit of French with him and he was so sweet to even compliment my French as I don't get to practice it often. I ended up telling him I was visiting and it was my early birthday. So, what a wonderful surprise it was that at the end of our meal he brought out a dessert for me and one for my friend also!  If I lived in Phoenix, this would definitely be my go-to-place. Very cozy/homey interior, delicious food and very reasonably priced with caring servers that go out of their way to make your dining experience enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Vincent Market Bistro for the past 5 years and they were one of my favorite restaurants then and they are still one of my favorite restaurants now. I normally eat here for brunch or lunch, but was told that they extended their hours and offer dinner.   I've always hated their service here because it was always slow and pitiful, but this morning was an exception. Maybe it's because we were the only customers here at 8 in the morning, but our server was really attentive and friendly. Their menu hasn't changed very much and I ordered the crab quiche and hubby ordered the French toast. They always offer complimentary croissants which is always awesome and buttery and delicious! I decided to not even share my entree with my hubby and I ate my crab quiche - all of it all by myself!   When we were done, like I remember, they offer complimentary dessert which was a fruit tart with ice cream on top. Prices are extremely inexpensive too! For two entrees, complimentary croissants and complimentary desserts, we spent around $25. What great value!!!   I love it here and if you like French cuisine, I'm sure you will love it here too! I will definitely come back to dine for dinner."}
{"text":"We wanted to host our engagement dinner at the bistro but their room wasn't big enough so they let use one of Vincent's rooms with the bistro's menu. Both of our families were very happy with our decision, we had a great time and the food was amazing as always.  Our server was also great and he spoke like 3 different languages which was very helpful because not everybody in our families speak English."}
{"text":"This has to be one of those times where it was just a bad day. I want to believe that, I truly do. But what happened needs to be addressed.  First off, I've been here before. I came here with my husband, his brother, and the brothers bf. We had an absolute FABULOUS time. Our server was attentive,  kind, and charming. The food was hot and fresh, and our drinks were never empty... That was the first time.  This time could not have been more opposite. First, no one was a designated host/hostess. So, servers would come outside, ask how many people were in a party, then disappear. And this would happen more than once so now there are two or more servers looking for a table. Often for different parties, so you can imagine the confusion. When we were finally seated we were pointed to the general direction of the table and asked to sit. And sit we did for 10 minutes without water or menus. Not even a run by from the server to let us know that he will be right with us. Nada. At the 10 minute mark menus were all but thrown at us by a server. Still no communication.   Then our server, Elijah I believe greeted us about 5 minutes later. He took our drink order and our brunch order, since we had more than enough time to decide, and ran off. Our drinks came 10 minutes later, along with no eye contact and a muttering of \"I'll have your croissants in a minutes\". 30 minutes later, no joke, we got our croissants. They were cold and hard as rocks on the ends and did not come with the preserves they generally come with. Then 5 minutes later came our cheese plate. And then 20 minutes after that my husband got his ham and gruyere omelet and I got a plate of something that was not my order. I had the runner take it back and continued to wait for my plate. Thankfully I only had to wait a couple additional minutes for my Ni√ßoise salad. Salad people.   Also, please keep in mind during that whole time, not once did the server come back. My husband had long since been out if iced tea and my mimosa glass was empty :(. We received not quite refills about 5 minutes after we received our plates. Meaning a carafe of tea was handed to my husband to serve himself and sparkling wine (half of a mimosa) was poured into my glass without a word spoken.   I will conclude with this. It was busy, but I have been a server before. I know what running around like a mad person looks like and what flat out ignoring a table looks like. Our server was chatting up other tables, so he obviously wasn't too rushed, right? We left a nice tip because we are nice people, but we will not be going through that again. Sorry Vincent's, you lost not only my husband and I, but our families as well. It's too bad."}
{"text":"This review is for their croissants! I LOVE THE WAY THEY TASTE!!!  The food is just OK nothing special.  Another great thing about this place is their free desert that they give you at the end of your meal!"}
{"text":"Not exactly French food, but very satisfying.  Huge meatballs and a seriously tasty burger for a fair price will have my friends and I return."}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review since we have breakfast here every week and love the food and the ambience, however the coffee has gotten horrible in the last couple of months, it tastes like warmed over dish water, and that's a very important component at breakfast. We ve complained every time, at first they tried to improve it but now it's just here it is, not, a good attitude on the part of the staff, we writing this so that Vincent himself is aware of this and hopefully will help them improve the coffee and the attitude."}
{"text":"This time we were directed to a patio table and seated ourselves only to be told it was reserved.  Okay, we moved. Then the waiter pored water on my wife's lap.  He changed the table cloth.  We ordered lobster bisk which was great.  Problem was after eating another order of bisk followed. We returned these two bowls even though we would like to have eaten them as well.  So the service sucked.  The pork loin followed and was excellent."}
{"text":"Great brunch restaurant! We tried here 2 times so far  We really like here a lot! Such a cute and cozy place with nice servers. And reasonable price! Lovely food! All the bake goods are so fresh, food is great!  If you are brunch person, you should try here!"}
{"text":"Another outstanding visit to the Bistro!  Great selection of $14 entrees and nice fixed-price three course with options.  Best. Butternut Squash Soup. Ever! Mussels and fries very flavorful - ask for a spoon for the liquid! The trout was lovely as was the lamb chop entree.  Free dessert! Nice wine list, outstanding service (Jose and Scott!!), nice pricing and a very pleasant atmosphere make this a go-to comfort place for us."}
{"text":"I know I don't live here anymore, but I remember hitting up Vincent Market Bistro on the weekend after a nice hike up Camelback. This is a great place to just come, relax, and enjoy a nice weekend  brunch.  The food is fresh and outstanding, and as always, the service is perfect.  Great place to take people who are in town visiting for a truly exceptional meal."}
{"text":"Pros: great food. I love the smoked salmon pizza and almond croissants. Friendly and attentive service. Accepts credit cards.   Cons: tables super close together, but I don't care. That means they can squeeze in more customers!"}
{"text":"Cute small place, don't bring a big group in because it just messes up atmosphere in there. It is a small group place. A nice date night even.   The serve nice freshly made croisants which are bad news for me because that is my favorite carb... :\   To be honest i forget what dish i had when i was here. My wife had a pizza and soup. Mine was delicious i remember that. What it was actually eludes me...  I thought the dish was going to be small, but food is plentiful here, as long as you aren't a college age'd guy, or training for a eating contest, you will most likely be satisfied (not full) here after dinner..   They gave us ALL free desserts at our table! really nice of them"}
{"text":"Cute environment which is right behind Vincent's on camelback. Great service and a prix fixed menu in the evening as well.  It should be much busier!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come for breakfast!!  It's a small restaurant, but the quality of the food in the morning is outstanding.  Upon sitting down, you are immediately greeted with the most delicious croissants and jam in town.  They are so light, flaky and buttery that the scream french bistro!  Plus, the breakfast entrees are extremely affordable and tasty.  My favorites are the eggs florentine and any of the quiches.  And I don't want to give away too many secrets, but prepare yourself for a nice surprise following your meal.  That is as much as I am at liberty to say ;)  Top notch and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Where can someone find both foie grois and souflee? Here at Vincent's. I searched the Scottsdale Phoenix area and found this perfect French bistro. The foie grois was tender and flavorful. The special elk topped saut√©ed spinach. My husband ordered the halibut sole duo and found it just wonderful. But the best was the souflee. Grand marnier. And the chef sent out the flourless chocolate torte to top!!"}
{"text":"I use to have a friend name Vincent  , black and white guy wrote all the sports articles for Wildcat uofa paper . Good roommate , Good friend and overall great Eskimo brother but the name Vincent no longer will bring his once cornrows self up , now I will recall the delicious 4 course meal that blew my taste buds into another world, whenever the name Vincent is mentioned. 1. The lobster pancake A+, lobster soup A+++, the Veal  A++++ and homemade ice cream will for ever ruin any store brand.  Nice quite place, you can talk relax , they brought out great birthday dessert so double the dessert love.  Man what a great meal . Now for two people this will run you s little over 100 (without the tip and trust me you will tip great services) but if you are looking for this place then you are looking for fine dining.  It is 100% worth it, special birthday , special anything pleas do yourself a service and dine here . Also get the lobster pasta dish and write a review so i can try it next time but once again that veal was so good medium rare , o my yas yas"}
{"text":"This place is quaint! The service was to die for, and the food was very good. I will definitely be back for more. Look out for the coffee, its strong!"}
{"text":"Nice little french restaurant with great service. Soup was good, Coq au Vin was a bit dry for my taste. They gave us free dessert which was very generous."}
{"text":"I mean , wow.  Tiny little spot behind the main 'fancy' restaurant and what a steal!  Absolutely delicious food and very affordable.  I opted for a prixe fixe course and it was delicous.  Butternut squash soup, which was rich and creamy; the lamb was absolute perfection and delicious.  Pink in the middle, but seared perfectly on the outside. Lastly, the profiteroles were delicous. Overall this was an excellent restaurant that I will definitely visit many more times to come."}
{"text":"Quality food well prepared and great price performance! $13 for rainbow trout over the best prepared mashed potatoes served with medley of veggies also well prepared."}
{"text":"We visited Vincent Marker Bistro for the second time this week. The first time we went was this past March. The food was so good. I had the lobster bisque for a starter and coq au vin for my main. My partner had the same starter and beef bourgogne for her main. We both had profiteroles for dessert. Yummy!! Everything was spot on. Our only complaint last March was that it was so hot in the restaurant, I almost had to leave. We gave them a pass because we thought it was kind of between seasons so we thought maybe they just weren't ready to turn the air on yet but really, it was way too hot!  So, we decided to give it another try. We ordered the tart flamb√© and e goat cheese nachos for starters. They were both out of this world, so good. For mains, I again ordered coq au vin and my partner ordered mussels and frites. The coq au vin was a little dry this time around but we were there at the end of the evening, so... Not really a good excuse. I was totally looking forward to the profiteroles but instead, we didn't get the chance to order them. They brought us out a brownie with ice cream. It was good but def not the profiteroles, those are amazing, maybe they ran out.  Here's the kicker, it was beastly hot again, even the servers were sweating like crazy. They seemingly had the air on but not high enough. It was miserable, so while the food was great and def worth repeated visits, I can't take the heat so I'll sadly have to stay out of their kitchen. Please Vincents, get the air working, so I can come back. Food was a little hit or miss but mostly hits. The apps were def worth a repeat visit. I'm def torn between a 3 and a 4 but then food is really a 4."}
{"text":"I actually can't believe the 4 1/2 star rating. I've been in the food industry for 41 years and have traveled all over the world. I ordered the brioche French toast and It wasn't only the least value that I have ever received (not that I was looking for a 'value' meal) but It really had very little flavor! My wife being from France ordered the omelet and noted to the waiter that It was an American omelet with a French name! The wait was also way too long for our small order."}
{"text":"What a great find!  Have been here 2x (for breakfast with parents) and 1x for dinner on Friday night.  The best part is unlimited croissants!  Yum!  Service is fast and quick.  Space is tight, but adds to the ambiance."}
{"text":"This is an amazing brunch spot!!!!  Cute atmosphere with perfectly prepared quiche and to die for fresh croissants as a starter.  The complementary desserts were an unexpected treat and were amazing.  The service here is what sets this bistro apart.  Our waiter was one of the nicest people you'll ever meet and provided exemplary, attentive service.  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place to eat like a gourmand without breaking the bank.  It's very similar to the main restaurant, filled with old-world French charm and haute-cuisine, but less expensive and less formal.  The space is somewhat cramped and gets quite loud, and last Saturday night the AC was barely working.  However despite these nuances, it was still an enjoyable and delicious meal.  The crowd was incredibly senior-- I felt like quite the spring chicken being the youngest at 31 years of age (which I must admit I didn't mind seeing as last time I went out in Scottsdale it was filled with 21-year olds all of whom seemed to already be botox-laden). The food: Curly Endive Salad with Mustard Dressing, Bacon, and Poached Egg- the deep, tangy, creamy Dijon dressing was perfect over the crunchy endive.  Add to that fatty, crispy bacon and a perfectly poached egg and you've got a near-perfect salad. The homemade lobster bisque (SOD) was exquisite.  Silky and creamy, loads of lobster flavor and just hints of butter in the background. Salmon Quesadilla- it actually wasn't much of an actual quesadilla but more like a flatbread, and it was my absolute favorite.  It's the classic pairing- dill, horseradish cream, etc, and very well-executed. Four Cheese Ravioli- they made this usual ho-hum dish sparkle with a light tomato basil sauce and sharp, delicious cheeses. Other guests in our party had the lamb shank and the filet mignon special, each of which were devoured with praise. The desserts also shone brightly- a fig tart with honey ice cream, profiteroles with rich dark chocolate sauce, luscious flourless chocolate cake- all were most-delectable.  I will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"By far one of the best restaurants/bistros in the US! Scrumptious dishes. Super friendly staff. Great value. I love having lunch at Vincent on Camelback. Coq au vin is divine, and soupe du jour is always a fresh treat. Complimentary dessert is served at lunch time. Trust me, you will love this place as much as I do."}
{"text":"I found this little Bistro quaint.  It is decorated as if you were in the French countryside; its colors, textures, the rough white stone brick wall, delicate wooden chairs, paintings of French countryside themes, and delicate flowers on the plates all left me with the feel I'd really walked into a rustic little French Bistro.  We dropped in for a late breakfast and as soon as we chose our table, they brought us mini croissants and strawberry preserves that were quite lovely.  I ordered an asparagus quiche that was golden brown on top.   The eggs were done perfectly and I believe there were some sundried tomatoes in it. Accompanying it was a salad of tossed greens with light vinaigrette which was heavenly.  My brother ordered the cheese & fruit plate which he said was delicious.  The thin little slices of bread were toasted to perfection and he was pleased with the overall arrangement.  I wish we'd had time to come back for lunch or dinner but I was only here for 4 days working on assignment so it will have to wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"We went here late, about a half hour before close. The place was packed and the only table available was on the patio. We kind of stood around and they told us we could sit there if we wanted to. We sat down, but there were still other people waiting who apparently didn't want to sit outside. I don't know if we were hard to see or if its just because they were busy, but we waited at least 20 minutes before anyone came to our table.   I ordered the prix fixe (butternut squash ravioli, beef brisket, and some eclaire type dessert that started with a p). My girlfriend had the pizza with bacon.   I don't know if its because it is a european style restaurant or what, but every course took forever, it took us two and a half hours to have dinner.  My squash ravioli in creme sauce was amazing, but there were literally only two of them.   The croissant basket that we received was ok, they were a little burned.  The beef brisket was awful. It was soaked in some kind of sauce that reminded me of gym socks. I would not order it again. The veggies on the side were lightly cooked, very little seasoning, and very fresh, these were great.  My girlfriend said her pizza was ok, but not anything special.   The dessert is what really stole the show. I have no idea what mine was called (it started with a P and was really long, I couldn't pronounce it), but dear god it was amazing. I could have eaten a meal of just that.   They did bring my girlfriend a small brownie with ice cream as well, which she appreciated.   I don't know if we would go back if this is a typical dinner experience. Maybe just get dessert to go."}
{"text":"This is one of those places I wish we could give 1/2 stars.  I would give this place 4 1/2 stars.  Really really good . . . but not out of this world fantastic.  The pizza is on par and may be better than pizzeria bianco - plus not the 4 hour wait.  We walked right in - it is very cute and charming.  It is a great place to go when you want high end food without the high end hassle."}
{"text":"Wow just ate here at their regular Saturday market (until about 1pm), which offers all a cornucopia of great eats (roasted Cornish hens and beef ribs - Very good but vegetables were a little greasy - there is such a thing as too much olive oil), paella (come early because we were there around noon and it was sold out- and they made 2 huge paella set ups), breads and pastries, organic medley of vegetables and salad mixes, crepes (longest line), paninis, omelets your way, fresh sashimi grade tuna and salmon, tacos Etc. So awesome. Parking next door in the mini mall is $5 but there is free parking off 39th. It was a great find - we were just gonna do a brunch at Vincent's."}
{"text":"Excellent food, delicately prepared and presented with class in a gorgeous setting.  The atmosphere of the restaurant reminds me of a Lyonnaise or Aix-en-Provence cafe. Frequented by more mature locals, it is quiet and composed, an excellent place for conversation. It's a little rustic and by no means formal; the service is inviting and just standoffish in southern French fashion. Best for smaller groups, no more than 4-6 people.  I've tried two dishes here, the Coq au Vin and the Salmon, and they both blow me away in terms of flavour. The portions are intelligently small, and each meal comes with some of the best mini-croissants I've ever tasted and a rotating dessert.   The only fault I can find are the prices; at $7-$10 a meal, I feel almost obliged to use the tip keep from feeling guilty. An absolute steal, hidden away."}
{"text":"Fresh french food was brought hot and complete. Nice desserts did not disappoint. Atmosphere was ok. The air conditioner kinda blew right on me, so a little uncomfortable, but worth it. We had a party of 9, so they took our reservation. Nice staff. Not many french speakers."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for a date, and the price is right!  Unique dishes and atmosphere.  Great specials and free desert.  I also can't say enough about the service.  Our server gave great recommendations and brought out 3 different deserts at the end of the meal.  To be honest, I had to think twice about posting a review of this place for fear that it's going to become too popular.  But I would give them 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"It is hard see how to improve Vincent Market Bistro.  Some have complained about table crowding in this relatively small restaurant, but there is ample room to maneuver and the noise level is not a problem.    The portions are not large, but they are not ridiculously small either.  You will probably want an appetiser and a main course, and possibly a dessert.  Get them all for $28 by using the prix frix offering.  This consists of a choice from 3 appetisers, a choice from 3 entrees, and a choice from 3 desserts.  The entries are top-end items too, such as steak, lobster, or rack of lamb.  HINT: I was told that reservations are not taken, and even on a weekday the venue gets crowded.  My suggestion is to go early, like 6 o'clock."}
{"text":"Quaint little place with loads of charm.  I ordered the prixe menu.  Each course was awesome.  Attentive and pleasant staff.  It will be a go to on my next visit."}
{"text":"Wow! Great food, great wait staff, not an overpriced menu. It really couldn't get any better. I had the BEST cheese platter that I ever had. Speechless. I can't wait to go to their other restaurant. One of the best experiences that I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service with no wait time. The food was presented well and the taste was superb! The staff are very attentive and courteous. Ambiance reminds me of a French bistro ala Proven√ßal."}
{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!!!  Perfect sized portion.  I had the saut√©ed salmon. In a very light cream sauce.  This was a wonder find while on a trip from Vegas!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice now after leaving the airport. This place is open-air with the smell of fresh flowers all around. The food is fresh, light, and delicious. Wait staff is accommodating and overall atmosphere is quaint and cozy. Desserts are completely fantastic! We love this place."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is incredible. Affordable for brunch, they serve warm croissants as the ore meal bread, and are great at customer service. I wish I could give 6 stars."}
{"text":"...the Saturday Market is awesome - except for the baked goods from Vincent's.  A $2.50 Almond Croissant that was 1/2 the size of my palm, lacking in flavor, and ice cold?  No.  Sorry.  No.  As a matter of fact, it was the worst almond croissant I have ever eaten.  The bread pudding was slightly better and the duck and pork tamales are actually quite good.  The overall \"Saturday Market\" is a nice place, but the products from Vincent's Market Bistro only make me wish I'd have just gone to Tammie Coe, La Grande Orange, or so many others instead."}
{"text":"I've been here four or five times over the last five or so years. Really good service and really good food. Last night I had duck confit with lentils and vegetables. it isn't a lot of food - but it tasted delicious. Portions are reasonable sized - not huge serving of mediocre food. Service was EXCELLENT - wish I was good at names - he was great. And then we got complimentary dessert - small piece of cake/brownie with one scoop of ice cream - delicious. Great coffee. The duck (with dessert) was $16 -  not cheap, but worth it.  Ambience is a little contradictory - sort of outdoor (although it is indoor), bright tablecloths, tables that are not that big. I've never been to France, but I'm guessing like (supposed to be like) a French outdoor cafe. The tables are pretty close together. Still, nice ambience.   Service and food are the stars - as they should be. I really should try to get there more often."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this boutique restaurant tucked away in the camelback corridor. The food is very good, presentation is beautiful and the staff is near perfect in their attention and care."}
{"text":"STOP HERE! Yummy brunch for a weekend morning, starting with the warm croissants and jam- so delicious- very good coffee, and the most charming little dining room. The tables were a bit tight for crutches, but normally it is cozy and just the way we like it. Our server was great, the smoked salmon quesadilla and the lobster quiche were both divine, and of course we were pleasantly surprised by the sweet desserts that came after the meal. I don't know why we forgot about this place for a bit, but now it is on our radar again and we'll be back to Vincent's."}
{"text":"One word...Amazing! My wife and I come to the Scottsdale often and finally found the little Gem in the desert we have been looking for. This place is a must. A regular menu is available but we ordered off the Prix Fix which let's you pick selections to make a 3 course meal for $25. You can't beat this deal for the quality. I had a Greek salad, rack of lamb and a fig tart. My wife chose a escargot spinach puff pastry, veal sweetbread and the cream cartolla (creme br√ªl√©e). Everything was fabulous! The service was outstanding. The servers were showing us what other people were ordering to help us make a choice as we were looking over all the choices. They also gave us a little history lesson on the chef/owner and establishment. Junior was our waiter and we've never had better service. Very personable. Bottom line...we are making this a regular stop every time we are in town. This place is a quaint French style cuisine with a great ambiance. Great job, Vincent!"}
{"text":"Wonderful French Bistro Ambiance.  Best Short Ribs in Wine Sauce I've ever had--was on Fixed Price All-In menu (Got 'em with Spinach rather than potatoes.) If you speak French, say Bon Soir to Chef; he'll love ya."}
{"text":"What a great way to get Vincent quality food for a nomial price. They have a wonderful patio you can sit at, and the docor inside is fantastic as well. Food was fantastic, as is to be expected."}
{"text":"I'm in love with this place. First time here. Ordered the Lamb Shank. Delicious. Words can't describe how great my experience was!"}
{"text":"I went here on a whim when the husband and I's anniversary dinner plans fell through. It was a wonderful experience! They have the prix fixe menu (3 course for 25$), but you don't even need to order this if you don't want to, we ordered two apps and two entrees and they brought out surprise desserts for us at the end (we didn't even mention it was our anniversary, I think they do this all the time), also it was less than 25$ pp...we each had wine and coffee and I think our bill was about 65$ or so. The food was very good, I had the coq au vin and it was delicious, rich flavor, and even better the next day. The desserts were wonderful, a chocolate pot and a lemon raspberry dessert...yum! The coffee was great too. I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite french food- it's so good! Service is excellent- best desserts in town - my favorite birthday treat"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what the fuss is about.....especially an overall rating of 4.5. The coffee's good (which is why they get 2 stars). Service is okay and the ambiance isn't quaint when cleanliness is questionable. I stopped by for a weekday breakfast and there were not any patrons in the bistro. I sat myself and ordered off a very limited weekday/breakfast menu. The mini croissants and jam were oily and not airy or light - obviously the result of a microwave. I ordered the \"build your own\" omelet. Looks good on paper but had to be sent back due to the absent Gruyere cheese. Should of just kept the original one since the added Gruyere did not change what would and did prove to be a very blah entree. The bacon was okay but definitely reheated. There is nothing French about this place - the French cook with fresh and tasteful ingredients.....maybe their dinner menu is better."}
{"text":"Great food but simple menu, correct portions. The homemade croissants and complimentary desserts are a great touch! Everyone who came in seemed like regulars and were greeted by name."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant. Good wine selection Appetizers we tried were scallops and smoked salmon quesadillas, excellent Salads were filling and tasty Rack of lamb very good Service superb  Waitress was very sweet and thoughtful  Dessert was awesome Definitely a place to return"}
{"text":"Point and shoot. Top to bottom the best food in Phoenix. You can't go wrong with any dish."}
{"text":"Another outstanding brunch at Vincent's. The scrambled eggs with chive and salmon were amazing and I tried the Quiche Lorraine which was also equally as delicious . You'll finish off with a complimentary dessert and today it was was flourless chocolate cake - excellent. This place is a must try for French in Arcadia."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times, mostly for lunch and I love it every time.  They serve the softest, warmest buttered croissants at the beginning - and don't be shy to ask for more! They are very nice about it.  And they are free!  They have a daily lunch special board - it used to be $10 but when we went yesterday, the price has gone up to $13.  The entree's look small, but they actually filled me up.  I had the beef bourguignon with mashed potatoes.  It was good but got heavy towards the end, so I traded with my brother, he ordered the pesto pasta ($7) with and added chicken (+$2).  The pesto pasta was very light but almost a little too bland.  At the end, you also get a complimentary dessert.  Our dessert yesterday was a flourless chocolate brownie with a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top.  It was so good!  That definitely made me super full.  I would come back again for lunch.  The place is small and quaint and the price may seem pricey for lunch, but the quality surpasses the price."}
