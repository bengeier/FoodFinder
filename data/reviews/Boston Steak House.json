{"text":"This is a Chinese restaurant that serves their take on western food. If you order their steaks it comes with a sweet bun, soup of your choice and a coffee or tea.  Food is decent considering pricing is inexpensive."}
{"text":"My gf and I use to come here 1-2 times a week for their late night snack specials. Back then the owners were very friendly and the menu choice was a lot of options. The food was pretty decent as well for the price offered, but now things have changed. New ownership lady is nice as well and seems to want to figure a way how to make things better. The portions are all relatively the same, but the clientele that they want to attract seems to not be interested. The price can't be beat, so perhaps their food quality has to step up in order to attract new ppl.   I've tried their whole menu selection and I can't say one thing really stands out. Just don't believe in the photos they appear, because (tada) its not the same look!!! haha I still pop by here once in a long while, but I'd say there are better choices out here in Scarborough."}
{"text":"I've been to better places and this place has definitely seen much brighter days. However, I recently have returned there to try it's lunch and dinner.   As for the lunch, I have tried their baked chicken/pork chop rice in cream sauce and it wasn't bad for the price of $7.50. The portions were fairly decent sized and it was not too bad to eat. However, as I went for dinner, the food went downhill. I personally ordered a Sirlion steak and Pork chop with fries and gravy. Now, I was expecting a fairly decently sized steak but I was disappointed. The steak was thin and small and it was overcooked to what I had order, which was medium rare. Now the pork chop itself wasn't too bad but the real problem was the sauce. They poured a gravy-like sauce with peppercorn inside it. Let me repeat that.. Peppercorn. I found balls of peppercorn within the sauce and it was way too salty.The fries were not fried properly and were mushy. Once you pour the sauce, it makes the fries stick to the plate. The other part is the pricing. I paid $15.99, if I recall correctly, for this meal and it was definitely not worth it. The food wasn't great compared to it's beginning near the mid-2000's.   If I had a choice, I wouldn't go back unless it's my last resort as the food is terrible and expensive at night and the service is laid back and doesn't have that steak hosue feeling anymore."}
{"text":"For the money, its a nice place for a individual or couple to go to and have a good hot meal. Steak is good. Gravy is thick and hot, poured over the steak when brought to your table. Sizzles and gets your taste buds ready. The place could use a update for interior, but it is clean, staff is fast and friendly and answer questions right away if you have any. Been here 4 times within a year, and will go back again soon when in the area again"}
{"text":"This is my first time writing a review, which I am doing only because this place is so terrible that I hope no one else will have to experience the crapiness that is this place.   Having grown up in Scarborough. I appreciate the dingy restaurant every now and then, but this place needs to be avoided. The whole concept of the place does not work. Service is lacking; no refills of tea, asked for water two times before brought, only customers in the restaurant, but coffee was still brought slowly, food was mediocre at best. Also, listening to karaoke music from the room over is not ideal.  Basically, I was looking to drink some sort of juice concoction, and asked what some of they were. I was told they had no bubble tea (even though there were many flavours advertised) and the other drinks were made from canned juice. I then asked for a recommendation and was brought - pure honey with some lemon slices in it. it was NOT drinkable as it was pure sugar. I mentioned that it was terrible (in nicer terms) and was told I would still have to pay for it. So for the first time I left absolutely no tip, when I am a pretty good tipper. I was then actually called out on why I had left no tip and of course I let the waitress know about all that was lacking.   I feel that if a restaurant wants your business/for you to return, they should atleast try to satisfy what you're looking for. I realize this is not an actual review about the steak, but from what we did order, overall there was NOTHING good about this place."}
{"text":"This Chinese themed steakhouse can't be compared to any of the other restaurants in the area.  The waitress does not speak English and is not attentive, even though the restaurant is almost completely empty. The steak doesn't taste like high-quality steak that you'll expect from a steakhouse. It was a major disappointment.  Washroom rating: UNAVAILABLE"}
{"text":"I go here with my (Hong Kong) family to eat lunch.  It is typical, nothing special when it comes to Hong Kong style food. Nice filling portions, and decent pricing for a Hong Kong style place.  The service is terrible though, severely understaffed. No one will refill your tea, hard to get a server's attention for cutlery, and they have this 'I have no time for you' attitude. If you want any custom orders (ie. unbuttered toast), expect for it to be neglected or screwed up.   Don't order anything healthy & western like salads or shrimp cocktails, you'll be disappointed. Only go there if you are not a picky eater, super hungry, and will eat anything with time to spare for silly waiting times.  Again, severely understaffed. Their valentine's decor is still up, I went in april."}
{"text":"I rarely go to this place but from time to time, I crave HK/Western food at night regardless of the quality. Previously I went here after work due to the fact that I think Asian Legend is overrated.   I ordered the fried chicken steak /w spaghetti combo/set dinner ($6.95) which includes a somewhat microwave version of Russian Borsht soup and bread roll and lemon tea which is decent. The fried chicken steak was alright and was the only highlight of the meal.   I would say I will not got to this place again but one day I might stumble here out of hate."}
{"text":"This is a decent restaurant located just on one of the strip malls by Sheppard and Kennedy. This restaurant features HK style western food (i.e. steak, pasta, baked entree).  I ordered a prime rib, which comes with soup (choice of tomato, creamy mushroom or chinese) and a drink. When your dish arrives, the waiter will ask you to hold the napkin up to cover your clothes, and then pour the sauce onto your dish. The purpose is to cover any spillage of sauce when it reacts with the metallic plate. The waiter was nice enough to remind me to put away my phone because the sauce reaction can definitely dirty my phone.  All in all, it is a good restaurant to try out the authentic HK style western food."}
{"text":"I will never go back to Boston again. I was given a \"special holiday\" menu where every single dish was at least 15$. Now, I used to come here few years ago. Meal prices were on average 5-10$. Boston is not a fancy restaurant at all. It's a cheap restaurant. To pay $15-20+ for one dish is just obscene. I ended up asking for their regular menu. Which they had, but did not bother to show when I was seated. I was annoyed to find that Identical dishes from the \"holiday special\" menu were marked up in price.   The seafood cream pasta and satay beef rice noodle in soup was ordered at my table. The seafood pasta tasted like a microwave dinner, specifically the Michelina's brand. The rice noodle in soup was not any better. They were stingy on the beef, with only 3-4 tiny slices of beef in a whole bowl of noodles. There was little satay sauce, and soup was watery and tasteless. They seemed to have diluted the soup with water. Overall, food was very bland and flavourless.   Service is mediocre at best. My waitress looked angry to serve and take my order. Perhaps she is a Grinch, had a bad day, or upset she did not scam me into ordering something from their overpriced holiday menu."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  The four of us all ordered the afternoon tea set. I've never seen such an anemic Hong Kong style egg sandwich before - see attached picture. Also, one of us got the \"big bowl noodle\" which is supposed to come with pork chop, beef brisket and wontons, but instead of wontons it came with fish balls. Lastly, another one of us got the smallest baked spaghetti in cream sauce ever - it's like a children sized portion, which I'd be ok with if that's what the menu said - but the menu didn't say that. Also should note that the chopsticks were sticky (yikes!) All in all yes the prices are cheap, but after you consider what you get, this is only average."}
{"text":"I've been here many times, so decided to write my first review on this restaurant.   This is a restaurant that serves Hong Kong Western style food. This restaurant used to have very nice beef steaks on sizzling plates, a specialty of the HK western style cuisine. In recent years, however, the quality of their steak has dropped and here I'll break it down to several areas from my last experience here today.  Today I came here with my brother, and I ordered an Angus sirloin steak on a sizzling plate, 70% cooked (medium-well), in a red wine mushroom sauce.  Ambience: The overall atmosphere of this restaurant is a bit bright, akin to Hong Kong style afternoon tea restaurants (which this one is not). The air does smell appetizing though with the taste of sizzly steaks up in the air. However, this would not be a restaurant for a date, for example. More suitable for the family outing. 3/5 stars   Service: Servers were overall courteous and responded in a decent manner. There was a bit of delay with payment processing but nothing too out of the ordinary.  3/5 stars  Food: My Angus Sirloin steak looks very appealing at first. It came with a side of fries, cream soup and bread. The steak itself was really not the best quality. I don't think it can be blamed on the chef but more on the quality of the steak itself. Parts of it were too hard to bite through and chew, but most of it was ok. The fries, however, were all soaked in the sauce and not crunchy by the time I got to it. The sizzly hot plate experience is great though for anyone who has not seen it before. They pour the sauce right when the plate is hot so the sauce sizzles in front of you. 3/5 stars  Price: Decent price, reflective of the meal served. Might be a bit more expensive than the average Hong Kong restaurants, but justifiable.  Overall: This is a restaurant that I would revisit, but only occasionally for the sizzling hot plate experience. If you are looking into decent quality steak, I suggest you go somewhere else. Best for family outings, not for dates.  Overall rating: 3/5 stars"}
{"text":"First time at Boston Steak House for lunch and I am unsure if I will be back. The restaurant itself is right by a Chinese mall and is fairly big for its size. It is outdated but the plaza itself is about the same.  There are food specials on the walls but it is all in Chinese. The lunch specials (mainly Chinese dishes) are quite cheap so if you are looking for a quick bite this may be the place. There are many options on the menu and  from what I recall most items come with a soup, bun and a drink. It is definitely good value and even before my food came, I saw the portion size from the table behind me and it was very generous. I ordered my usual \"go-to\" dish at a HK style cafe- baked chicken with spaghetti in tomato sauce. The cream soup was good so no complaints. The baked dish looked really good but the taste did not impress. It was bland and the pasta was overdone....it was actually hard to eat due to the taste and texture. My brother ordered the curry beef brisket with rice and he thought it was okay. We both got hot milk tea and it was hot and tasted fresh so no complaints there. I will likely try another restaurant before coming back to this one unless maybe I will try their steak next time.  In addition, the service was good as we were seated quickly, attended to and served in a timely fashion. Glad everything was on time as I was slightly in a hurry for an appointment."}
{"text":"So calling this place a steak house is misleading. It's more like a HK style cafe with aspirations to be a little fancier with the meal items.... but not quite getting there.  I would recommend sticking to the Western style Chinese food, like pork-chop buns, steaks on a sizzling hot plate and the baked rice dishes. Venture away from these at your own peril. I usually come here for the 'afternoon tea' meals which include a drink at a reasonable price. We had the pork chop bun, club sandwich and wonton noodles.  The sandwiches were fine, but the noodles were too soft and disappointing.... should have known better. 3 meals for under $20, not too bad.   I've been here several times over the years and it's never busy. There are always tables available, so you know you can be in an out fast if you just need a quick meal somewhere. Also, it helps if you speak Chinese because it makes it easier to move things along."}
{"text":"Pretty typical HK style cafe. Open and spacious but a bit dated. Went with the baked pork chop with rice for $7.50   Meal comes with a soft plain bun, choice of soup and a hot drink. I went with cream soup with a milk tea. I really liked the soft bun. Not many Chinese HK cafes offer this with the meal any longer so it was a pleasant surpise. The pork chop was thin and a bit dry but still tasted okay. It was a decent portion and pretty good value at $7.50  There were not many customers so service was spot on. Its a decent place to get a cheap, fast and filling meal."}
{"text":"2.5/5  This place has seen better days. When I tried here back in the early to mid-2000s, it was one of the best Chinese western style steak houses in the area. However, after trying it tonight, this place has gone downhill to a state where I would probably not visit again unless I'm actually in the area.  We ordered three iron plates: Tenderloin, filet mignon, and filet mignon + scallops; all medium requested. With it came three mussels with cheese, the typical borscht/cream soup, and drinks.   The tenderloin was the best of the iron plates, with it being cooked exactly medium. The filet mignon was way too rare, while the filet mignon + scallops was way too well done. Oh, and the scallops were not what I expected; it was fried and looked like those you get from a President's Choice box in your local Loblaws store.  The three mussels with cheese was nothing special, but it came on the house...so we'll let that slide.  The borscht and cream soups were actually very good! I might have lucked out looking at other reviews, but both our soups have the aroma and taste you'd expect, and it wasn't as diluted as some other typical Chinese restaurants.  We ordered iced lemon tea and iced milk tea for drinks. The milk tea was average, but the lemon tea was too warm...and the tea tasted a little off, which means one thing: old.  Service was mediocre, hence why I did not upgrade it to 3 stars. One of the waitresses simply dumped the utensils on the table in front of my mom so we ended up having to sort everything out. In addition, our drinks didn't arrive at the same time, but we left a space for the waitress to put the last drink. However, she decided to put the last drink behind the stand where the menus are placed, which meant my mom had to reach over the menus in order to obtain her drink. Seriously, why would you do that? That's a lack of professionalism.  Finally, the name doesn't speak justice to this place. I rather it being called Sheppard Cafe or something...cause there's simply no Boston feel or a steak house feel to the restaurant. It's your typical HK style western food with typical prices...and less than typical dining atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I came here with my aunt, and it was one of the worst restraints I've ever been to. It's a total waste of money.  The waiters could barely speak English, and they weren't attentive or polite. I asked for water, and they never got me the water. Did I mention here were only 4 other tables filled at the restaurant? It's not hard to get me a glass of water.  They didn't even have most of the things listed on the menu. I ordered a piña colada, but they didn't have. I ordered a shirley temple, they didn't have. I ordered orange juice? Nope. Well, they had to have nestea at least right? Wrong. I ended up getting sprite.  Most of the food and appetizers also weren't available.  The steak was tough and tasted very cheap. The escargot looked nothing like the picture on the menu. It was disgusting and tasted like medicine. I had to spit it out. The curry was mediocre. I really don't like this restaurant, especially since I ended up with food poisoning which turned into a fever and I had to stay in bed for a week. I would rate this less than a star, but that doesn't exist. Don't go here. You'll regret it."}
{"text":"Was here for a quick lunch, so time for an update.  The service and the food both were decent. I was in and out in less than 20 minute.  Not as good as the good old days but not a bad choice for a bite if you are in the area."}
