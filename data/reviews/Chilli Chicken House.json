{"text":"Great food!  Fast, easy to take out and great vegetarian options.  My family and i frequently take out from here."}
{"text":"My usual spots for Hakka where Ming Room, Eddies and Asian Wok and Roll.  My cousin and I decided to try Chilli Chicken house on advice from another cousin of ours.  We were skeptical at first.  We ordered Chilli Chicken (of course), Shrimp Pakora, Szechuan beef and hot and sour soup.  End to end the meal was deeeelish!!  The portions big and were shareable, the food was served hot.  Most of all the food was tasty.
I'm taking my wife there tonight for a date.

I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want this Gem of a spot to get too well known.  Ah well... my opinion... You want Hakka you gotta go here!"}
{"text":"The place doesnt look fancy and takes debit only. The food is very good, servers are friendly and the price is very very reasonable for the quantity of food they serve for an order. I consider myself a big eater, so trust me the quantity in an order is more than sufficient. The wonton soup is as good as some of the finest chinese restaurants in India. A good place for dine-in or take out."}
{"text":"We ate chicken chili with gravy
Crispy beef
Szechwan chow mien 
Came with steamed rice


I cannot even choose what is better out of the main dishes. All so good. We ate more than we should have since it was so good.  I really enjoyed the flavor and spices! 

Service was amazing. We had help with choosing what we ordered. He asked our preferences and accommodated us with his recommendations. The waiter was very helpful and polite. Checked on us periodically. Brought water without us asking :-).  
I'm very impressed and happy. Both of us are.  Now for the fortune cookie."}
{"text":"What does one say about Chilli Chicken House.....4.5/5!!

I've had this place bookmarked for months and I've finally had the opportunity to go and check it out! And my God, was it worth the wait. 

We went around 8pm (two of us) and when we walked in, it didn't seem too crowded; two tables of four were empty so we waited for one of the waiters to come and seat us only to have him tell us that a table will be free within the next 15-20mins......which was a bit odd but we went with it anyway (this is the only reason I took off that .5 from my rating lol!)

Fast forward to being seated, I already knew I was getting the chilli chicken (ended up choosing dry) although I was seriously contemplating the crispy beef....looks like I'll be going back for that one. We also decided to get the black bean beef. 

They didn't delay with the food, I'd say it came within 10 minutes. It was fantastic. Everything was delicious! Each plate was a pretty generous helping and they came with a side of rice, which was more than enough. The black bean beef was a straight forward 5/5....nothing wrong whatsoever. Tender and saucy, with a delicate sweetness that keeps you hungry for more! The chili chicken was a bit on the spicier side...I personally don't mind that level of spicyness but it might not be everyone's cup of tea. I'm also an avid rice lover and although you can't go too wrong with making it, theirs was awesome! Both players were under $10 and for their sizes, that's pretty darn good. 

Service was great and everyone was very polite and friendly. This place is definitely worth a try :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Indian Chinese places in town! The crispy eggplant, lemon chicken and noodles are awesome! :-) It has become our go-to place for inexpensive yummy Indian Chinese in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Wow. Must get the dry style chilli fish. Veg pakora Manchurian was excellent as well. Huge portions and very reasonable prices. Must go here for Hakka Chinese."}
{"text":"Part of me doesn't want to write this review because then even more people will start going here...but the not selfish part of me wants you all to know how great it is! The owner is really personable and makes an effort to get to know the clients, always stops by to say hello. 
We were there during Ramadan last year and anytime a table came in and said they were fasting/waiting for sunset etc he offered them a fresh fruit plate which I thought was really nice. 
We always get the chicken chow mein but their fish pakoras, general tao chicken, chicken pakoras, schezuan beef are also really good. Never disappointed. We go at least once every three weeks - cash or debit only!"}
{"text":"Love the crispy beef so much that I hardly try anything else. Other reviewers have mentioned receiving dried out steamed rice and, yes, I've had that happen to me once too. The General Tao chicken is good, the sauce is quite thick and coloured red. A friend had the butter chicken, I wasn't a fan of it but to each their own."}
{"text":"Had to have been one of their first customers when they first opened. I remember the days when this place just opened up and was dead. Now when I pass by it's filled and there is new staff. Before it was just I believe the nephew and uncle? They are nice guys. Anyways the pakoras here are to die for. But I recently ordered food this past week and it just doesn't taste the same anymore. It is still a good hakka place but the quality has fallen from it's early days. The chilli chicken and manchurian chicken are good bets. My favourite here is the chicken corn soup - add some of the hot sauce in it and you're golden."}
{"text":"My go to Hakka restaurant when I'm looking for something spicy. Usually order the same things...chilli chicken with gravy, Crispy beef, shrimp pakora and a noodle dish (we switch it up depending on the preference for that time). My only negative comment about the food is that shrimp pakora should be made smaller...or cooked longer. The inside of the pakoras are not cooked in the middle and we often are around them since we had take out and couldn't ask them to refry them."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Easily one of the best Hakka cuisine restaurants in town! They need to work on the restaurant ambience and service, however. This is a place I prefer for takeout."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, and affordable.
I would eat here everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"Busy...but food was full of'food color' .prices was like other places. People were keep comming.n service was slow n unorganised.cant go back because usage of food colors."}
{"text":"I ordered the Chili Chicken combo (with gravy and steamed rice) for one. It tasted amazing. The service was great too. Waited the typical 10 mins for it to be ready. The ratio of rice compared to the chicken was too much. They could afford reducing the amount of rice and maybe even the price slightly lower with a smaller container."}
{"text":"Great taste and very friendly staff. Make sure you get in time cause sometime it is busy..."}
{"text":"I have been coming here with my family for almost a year now, and the food is constantly delicious, and the service has never had a down day. Hakka cuisine is Indian infused Chinese food in essence and that poured through in spades. Although not a huge restaurant, the atmosphere is close warm and homey, the servers are friendly and the food is phenomenal. The crispy beef and the Hakka chow mien are my personal favourites."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout at a Friday night. When we went there, we found that people waiting outside of the door, so we were kind of thankful for ordering through phone. Interior looked cozy and the small place was packed. My review is based on the taste of food only. We ordered Hakka noodles, egg fried rice, manchurian chicken, and manchurian cauliflowers. The rice and noodles items were ok. The portion size of the chicken and vegetable dishes were smaller than those from average hakka restaurants and the taste was not very remarkable. I loved the chili paste that they provided with the order though. Among these 4 items we ordered, the noodles was the best. I might have to try out this place once more and dine in there for a better valuation."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food place in Mississauga! The manchurian chicken is delicious"}
{"text":"Service is usually very fast and food is consistently good the few times I've been! Very nice owner as well"}
{"text":"My go-to place in Mississauga! The food is always so fresh, delicious, and flavourful. There isn't a whole lot of seating, so it's best to come before or after busy times as the restaurant is quite popular. The service is always prompt, and you get so much food for what you pay for. I always have leftovers, and having it the next day only makes me crave for it even more!

My favourite dishes are: chili chicken (with gravy), chili garlic shrimp, and green beans. The sauce on the 2 meat dishes goes great with the complimentary rice. The green beans are always a staple veggie dish as I could never possibly make it with that much skill. Cant wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Feeling lazy and you don't wanna cook. You are on a budget, you wanna squeeze lunch and dinner in one order, but you don;t want to trade your taste buds. Go to Chilli Chicken House. I have ordered take out consistently for the last 4 weeks and they are yet to fail on me. First off the quantity,you can feed your self and your two kids and may have some leftovers. Second the food is absolute stunner. They are the perfect fusion of Chinese and Indian cuisine. Love their take on butter chicken and the star Chilli chicken is delicious. Above all the dishes are made to order and when they come out of the kitchen they are piping hot. Last but not least, the price is right on the point."}
{"text":"Awesome Hakka food, great lunch specials. Not heavy breaded, lots of meat and very flavourful. Staff is mostly friendly."}
{"text":"YES !!!! food is really good, Love the chili chicken !!! a must try."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVED the place. The price was so affordable and the portions were huge! The chilli beef and hakka noodles were definitely my favorite. The beef was extremely tender and well seasoned. I'm really glad we stumbled upon this place! We also ordered a hot garlic chicken and the flavor was really unique- sort of tangy with a hint of spice. Tip: definitely get the chili beef DRY, so good!"}
{"text":"Best chili chicken for the money !!
I try coming in at least once a week but been slacking due to the holidays going to try there Tom Yum FYI it's not like thai express you don't get any noodles"}
{"text":"This place is my go to Hakka chinese place. I love love love their food so much that 9/10 times I get take out, its from here. 

The owner is very friendly and involved in the business, and you can definitely taste this in the food. We usually order the manchurian noodles, the manchurian pokara style with gravy and the paneer chilli with gravy. The dishes with gravy come with alot of plain rice. If you arent a spice lover like me , they're very accommodating and can tone the heat down. The portions are average sized, can feed up to 4 people. 

The only complain I have about this place is the size of the restaurant itself. It is a very small place, and is often packed. Sometimes the waits are long, and I have had to wait (impatiently) for almost half an hour to an hour depending on the day. However, once seated the service is fast and the servers are all very friendly. And the crispiness of the manchurian (which you wont get with the takeout) is totally worth it! 

10/10 would recommend this place to anyone who loves the flavour bomb that is Hakka chinese food."}
{"text":"A nice small family run business (so on a Saturday night when they have more customers, the service isn't fast but it's not slow either). They're new and already popular but don't have room for more tables so you might have a problem if you go on a busy night in the future with a large group....it's not upscale at all, very basic but the service is great and prices are affordable.

I don't think it's the best hakka place in Mississauga as others said but it's up there and it is better than Eddie's or Ming Rom and some of the ones around Mavis/Hurontario.

I didn't find their hakka noodles to be as good as the other places because they don't have that smoked taste but they do a great job with Chow Mein compared to other places. They have quite a few neat dishes, their crunchy beef is quite good as well and the spicy dishes are actually spicy (especially the soup, it was over the top spicy so I would recommend the non-Spicy soup). The chilli chicken itself I didn't find to be anything special nor the fish so I would recommend the beef more. Their appetizers are really good though, especially pakoras.

Hopefully they can keep their prices/service/food quality at a nice level."}
{"text":"Love it. Huge servings and friendly service. It's in a strip mall which makes it seem like a typical suburban food-house but it was actually great. There were some kids jumping around on the benches next to us which was a bit distracting but that party left soon after we sat down. Since it's a suburban restaurant in a residential neighborhood it wasn't surprising. Servings were huge , lots of meat and plenty of starch to balance. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"This haka restaurant is amazing. But I wouldn't recommend going there on a weekend. It's pretty packed and the seating is limited. But overall, the service and food is excellent."}
{"text":"Rarely do I ever give 5 stars and that too only after more than one visit.  This place is the real deal. Fresh, hot, tasty food, friendly and fast service and clean place.  Good job!"}
{"text":"Very good place to dine-in and takeout. We went there and ordered for take out several times. Foods are delicious. Service is also good. I personally love their house special soup. Never been disappointed! Friendly and fast service always. One of the best place in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Crispy beef is out of this world. Tender jerky style beef with sweet spicy sauce. Must try!!! Staff is really friendly and fast.. Best halal Chinese spot in GTA."}
{"text":"Nice Halal Food especially hot & sour soup and beef / chicken chilli dry/noodles. Recommended for all Desi"}
{"text":"This is the best Hakka Chineese place in GTA. I love the Chilli chicken and Hakka noodles. The red chilli sauce is simply out of this world. Once you try the food here you will never eat any where else."}
{"text":"I read about this place from RFD. Some people were raving about it. From the sounds of it, this is a fairly new spot.  You'll find this right beside Bubble Republic.  I haven't stepped inside myself but according to my husband, the place is clean and the staff were courteous.

We've done take out twice this past weekend.  We have had the typical Hakka dishes - pakoras, chili chicken, bombay chicken, manchurian fried rice.  I also ordered the chicken and corn soup. We also tried what they called 'hot garlic chicken'.

The pakoras, chili chicken, bombay chicken and the fried rice were great!  The flavours worked, the serving sizes plentiful.  If you visit their website, their menu doesn't indicate if you can get your dishes with gravy or dry.  You can actually request them either way, so just make sure to let them know when you order.

I wasn't too keen on the hot garlic chicken which we got dry. I might try it next time with the gravy.

Overall, this place is a keeper. Mississauga's Hakka restaurants have been a fail so no more going to Scarborough for Hakka!"}
{"text":"Spicy food? CHECK. Excellent taste? CHECK. Great service? CHECK. Affordable? CHECK. 

That's the gist of it. I strongly suggest getting the dry versions of the food even if it is off-menu. Those taste better. The owner is warm and welcoming, and greets his regulars in person all the time.

Standard wise, this is the best Hakka restaurant in Mississauga, and I have tried the others. Note that it is debit and cash only."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this resto ever since it opened and it has not failed me yet.   They should rename this place as Flavor City but Chilli Chicken House is just fine cause their chilli chicken is bomb.   Shrimp pakora is on point and the spicy wings are some of the best in sauga.   If you're looking for best bang for your Buck as well then CCH is your place.   Lunch special for under $10 bucks is more than enough to out you to sleep after eating there.   Friendly staff very welcoming and always smiling.   CCH is definitely a staple in sauga and probably be around for decades."}
{"text":"Been hearing the buzz about this place for years so finally took the plunge and went there.

Super busy but staff was attentive and nice. Got take out. All veggie options, and they did a great job. Everything was tasty and good portions. I can see why this is always talked about as one of the better hakka places in Sauga!"}
{"text":"Very crowded; recommend reservation on the weekend. Food is very delicious. Free green tea. Halal as well, though I did not see the certificate."}
{"text":"Sorry guys...I went here because of yelp reviews but was quite disappointed. The food was edible but the service was poor. Overall I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered the crispy eggplant, beef fried rice and the sweet and spicy chicken. Overall we paid around 40 dollars for 2 people with left over fried rice (they give you a free huge bowl of white rice along with your dishes). The crispy eggplant was good. It had a black bean sauce kind of taste but the eggplant was simply breaded (same batter as chicken balls) and fried. The sweet and spicy chicken was perfect in terms of sweetness, though it was a little dry. Beef fried rice is like the fried rice you get at any other \"Canadian Chinese\" restaurant: not too much beef and the rice was a little too dry for my taste.
The service was good and fast. The place was full when we went in but everyone have gotten their food. We ordered and got our food probably within 8-10 minutes.

I didn't really understand what Haka Chinese food was I guess. I was hoping for more traditional Chinese food so that's why I gave a 3/5 for the food not being too similar. If you enjoy this kind of food then you will probably like this place. If you crave more traditional Chinese food, there are a bunch of places around the Btrust supermarket (Right across the street)."}
{"text":"Reasonable and flavorful. A restaurant we frequent often, and always enjoy.  Our favorite  spring chicken; and hakka noodles. The service is Friendly and  courteous."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I have tired like 10 different dishes and all of them are good. Not much more to say then the value at this place is fantastic. Chili Chicken is amazing here. 

The 10% discount for take is great too. The prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Chilli Chicken House is my go to takeout place whenever I feel like a break. My kids' favourite dish is the hot and sour soup and chilli shrimp. We have never been disappointed with any dish. Friendly staff and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great food!  2 families 8 people.. Had 6 dishes of various spice levels.  We notified one of the servers one of our dishes didn't come.  They apologized and served up the dish in 5 minutes and on the house!  Had: manturian fish, shrimp pakora, chilly chicken(dry), crispy beef, beef chow mein, butter chicken.  All of them were very different than the Indian counterparts but were excellent hakka take of them. My personal favorite was the manturian fish, but  all 6 dishes were someone's favorite at the table. 5/5."}
{"text":"This place is mad busy and so I give them 4 stars. The food here is fantastic. The servers, inc the owner are friendly and add to the whole experience. Given their success, they really need to move to a larger space. We got the staple hakka diet dishes, chilli chicken, house fried rice and american chop suey. I'm not ordering american chop suey again...to sweet for my taste buds.
I would go back when the crowd is less. I would pay close attention to seating order since they don't have a proper waiting system in action. Another table got seated before us and that was not cool because we had a very hungry 7 month old at hand. Hopefully, that's changed."}
{"text":"Nothing better to pig out on some hakka chinese after long hard week of work. haha. 

And this is the best hakka place I've been to in the GTA... and I've been quite a few.  Everything tastes so good! Portions are big as well... I don't think I could ever finish all the food. (the staff always packs them up for me lol). 

My favorite dishes have to be: ginger fish, chili calamari and the hakka chowmein."}
{"text":"Looked better then it tasted. I would go back if invited by a friend but there's more better options out there"}
{"text":"We love going here. They have good service and great food. We always get Hakka chowmin and garlic chicken. It deserves the price we tried many Hakka restaurants but this is the best one so far."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Mississauga. We love the sweet & spicy crispy chicken and green beans.  The owner is a very quiet, kind man and he is always ALWAYS there. The servers are attentive and friendly. Be prepared to wait longer for takeout food on Friday and Saturday, as they have become very popular over the last few years. Otherwise, takeout usually only takes 20-25 minutes.

It's the best! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"With all the great reviews I thought I would like this place more. Honestly it was just ok, nothing I would go out of my way to get. we ordered the chilli chicken in gravy and the hakka noodles. The chicken was ok I wouldn't order it again though it kinda hard a weird after taste like the chicken wasn't the freshest. The noodles were very good me and my brother really enjoyed them and would probably order it again. If you are in the area I would try them out but don't be driving miles just to eat here."}
{"text":"What more can you say then what has already been said everything is decent, cooked fresh and always hot and spicy. A go to for a quick cheap lunch or take out."}
{"text":"Service is fast. This place is always busy, no matter when you go.

It is a typical tasty, spicy hakka place. I enjoy their chilli chicken a lot. 

Almost everything they serve on their menu is tasty and good comfort food."}
{"text":"The place is small and cozy. I love the vegetable munchurian here. It's awesome. They have lunch and dinner menu for really low price with great options.
I've tried different types of noodles but nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"I went to this place a few days back with my family... I liked the food and quantity was also good"}
{"text":"Extremely garlicky .. I cant believe it has so many good reviews have you people never been to any other hakka restaurant"}
{"text":"I had pretty high expectations for this place after reading all of the YELP reviews but I was so disappointed.  We were a group of 8 that decided to order from the menu and share our meals family style.  We had a really hard time finding something on the menu that wasn't deep fried then covered in sauce OR a vegetable of some sort OR not a carb.  All of the dishes are reasonably priced but every single dish we ordered was deep fried then covered in sauce!  I won't be going back ever again."}
{"text":"Great food, and good service. We ordered the Hakka chowmein, chili chicken gravy, chili pepper fish and schezuan rice. All were fantastic. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Very good butter chicken.  Most dishes seem to be very good.  Great friendly service."}
{"text":"Authentic Hakka indian food!  Ordered takeout.  Service was good and prompt.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Excellent Hakka Spot!

Lunch Special's are well priced and portions are great."}
{"text":"Not a cool or trendy place, but a great place for foodies.

Chili Chicken was really good, and the shrimp pakoras were excellent.
If I'm going Hakka, then I'm going here (note: that's no knock to Eddie's Wok n Roll which also has solid Hakka, but is a bit pricier and a bit farther away).

A decent place where you can grab a bunch of takeout, and munch away for a couple days."}
{"text":"To be honest it was my first visit to restaurant and i really love it i love the food i love the serving of girl with small height and dark makeup she was really gd at her work and dedicated....just love it"}
{"text":"The food is good, especially the chicken pakoras and the crispy beef. I've been here a few times and the restaurant always seems to be pretty crowded, but that may be because the place is not that big."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!! Great chilli chicken, manchurian chicken & Hakka noodles!! Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I tried the chili chicken dry, butter chicken and the sweet and sour chicken today, was quite disappointed since none of them impressed me. The chili chicken was too salty and not spicy at all. The sweet and sour chicken was just so so. Maybe I should try the crispy beef next time."}
{"text":"This place was great. Dinner combination portions were huge. Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for good and cheap Hakka cuisine."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place while running an errand. Food was decent - if you are hungry and looking for a Hakka chinese fix - this place is great. Small space for seating though, service was fine, should have given a water jug for the table instead of coming by the table so much for filling the glass. At times, we needed water and glasses were empty so we had to call the servers to fill the glass. Ordered the chicken pakora, hot and sour soup, chili chicken and special fried rice. Pakoras were huge and delicious! I recommend the Chili chicken dish as well. The soup needs work - it was quite bland - we had to put the extra sauces in to make it more \"hot & sour\". I may visit again only if I am in the area and looking for hakka. I wouldnt go out of my way..would rather visit other hakka joints with more space and less feel of a quick fix."}
{"text":"Yes, loved it. I honestly can't remember what we ordered, but we usually do a paneer dish, a noodle dish and a rice dish, and something is usually manchurian flavoured. All delicious, friendly service, and comfortable restaurant. We got really lucky because we arrived early and got a table no problem. Within 15 minutes, there was a line up at the door. Another time we tried to order take-out, but there was an hour long wait, so we went with a different restaurant. I gotta go back :)"}
{"text":"Service at Chilli Chicken House is surprisingly fast given how busy it is. I guess they do have a lot of servers for a restaurant of that size though. I tried the Manchurian Fried Rice because I kind of didn't know what I wanted at the time.

(Plus, it gave me a chance to make a Manchurian Candidate joke)
(Was it all worth it for a joke no one at the table got? Yes it was)

To my surprise the Manchurian fried rice is bright red. Like paprika red. I started getting worried because it looked spicy enough to melt my retainer. The fact that every other table was Indian didn't help cause their spice-tolerance levels has probably towed the average way up for this restaurant.

i was pleasantly surprised when I bit into it though. It wasn't spicy at all, the intense red colour just had this placebo effect thingy.

The rice was pretty good, not clumped together, not too oily, and stuck to your teeth as you chewed it just a tiny bit.

In conclusion, it's a pretty kewl restaurant. I'll dine here again next time I storm out of Bubble Republic next door after waiting too long. B)"}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing portions we love going there again n again......Try the Gobi Manchurian and American Veg Chopsuey it's just amazing ....best Chinese restaurant for both veg n non veg food"}
{"text":"It's actually the best Chinese food I've had in TO/GTA. Super service, delicious Hakka food, and exceptionally clean. Clean! Everything is spotless. They're always keeping busy washing utensils if there's a spare moment. Get that Manchurian Gobi. Basically a whole cauliflower! This dish will change how you look at cauliflowers."}
{"text":"Lunch special is good, price is reasonable as well. Right next to bubble republic too!"}
{"text":"attentive staff, great food, good portions 

you must try the crispy fried eggplant dish omg i have dreams about it, so good"}
{"text":"Great place! The customer service is always friendly and I never have to wait for seating and service is quick. The food is good, though they tend to over do it with the sauces. Most of the time my takeout sweet and sour dishes are overflowing by the time I get home. That's my only vice with the place though."}
{"text":"So finally I got to visit this place. Unfortunately I was expecting a lot from this place because of what I had read. 
We started with the Chilli chicken dry since that was the most popular dish there. In my opinion it wasn't that bad, pretty decent with flavour in it. Next up was chicken pakora, which was not good at all the only reason would be the taste, I couldn't figure out the spices. 

Main dish we had Kung Pao chicken, Szechwan chicken gravy, Chicken chowmein noodles and Manchurian fried rice. I wouldn't recommend to order kung pao chicken because it was too sweet and bland. I loved the combination of Manchurian fried rice with the Szechwan gravy on top.

Lastly, to end this the servers were friendly. Even though the food didn't impress me, the servers made sure I enjoyed the atmosphere. 

Quality: 2.5
Service: 4.5
Food: 3.0"}
{"text":"With almost 300 reviews  on Yelp and most of them being great this is the must go place when visiting Mississauga . 
This hidden  gem is one of the Top restaurants  in Mississauga  with out the high price .
Portions  are huge and the price is fair .
Great service  .
Order some extra for.your lunch the next day ."}
{"text":"I cant believe I've waited this long to write this review. This is one of my favourite spots in Mississauga and I'm a regular here for either take out or dine-in. I would recommend starting with their delicious Pakoras, my personal favourite would be the shrimp pakora, packed with lots of shrimp & spices, my companions liked the veggie one too but it wasn't to my taste. Their namesake dish, chilli chicken is to die for, I would recommend the dry form although the saucy version is just as good but it just depends on your texture preference. I've also tried the schezuaan chicken, sesame chicken, and crispy beef, all of the dishes have not disappointed. And the manchurian noodles (spicy) and Hakka Chow mein are also good.
Now as for the dine-in experience I have found that during busy weekends, and they are always packed in the weekends, the service can be a bit slow but I feel like the staff is doing their best to accommodate the large number of people pouring in to the place. Its a small seating area with a back room extension that can seat about 70 people in total. The waitress made sure our water glasses were refilled and tried to check on our table when she got a chance.
If you are getting take out I suggest calling and having them prepare your order before going there as it might take some time. Definite 5* from me.  
P.S Cash or debit only"}
{"text":"Large order made for pick up. Some items over salted and some tasteless, mostly over breaded and soggy in sauce.. The big issue was, as everyone does, leftovers.
The following day could not believe the sauces, 90% corn starch. Could have cemented my driveway. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Came based off of the Yelp reviews. Highly recommended dishes by others include the dry chili chicken and crispy beef. I ordered both and they were both different and delicious. I cant recommend one over the other so order both like I did! You wont be disappointed! food comes hot, fresh, and fast, lots of parking, but tiny hole in the wall spot that fills quickly! You will find all types of people eating here. Check it out"}

Spicy Garlic Fish 
Chilli Beef 

are my favorites"}
{"text":"I have no words to describe how much I LOVE their dry chili chicken. I have dreams about it. I've never had anything more tasty. Also love their green bean stalks. If this was healthy food, I'd eat it every day. My favorite restaurant in the world. Not pretentious, good prices and quick service. Can't beat it."}

Have to say I will be back.  Everything was great.  
Delicious food. Huge portions   
I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Great food and the owner is great very friendly and accommodating, great to see attentive business owners it's rare these days. 

The place is small book ahead for big groups!"}
{"text":"I kind of liked this places compared to other ,as I am look hakka food and have tired many place. 

Initially I did a take out from here and the service was friendly fast and the packing of the food was great as it kept it hot till I got back home. The food was packed clean and all the dishes were quite good.You also get 10% of on takeout orders above $25 if you pay cash.

Bombay Fish - 5/5
Spicy Chicken dry - 5/5
Chicken Manchurian - 3/5
Chicken Fried rice - 4/5

The portions were friendly and the food was a lot. The spiciness was to the perfection and wasn't over done with sauces as well. 

Second time, I went in with some office colleges for lunch and hey where can you get a $7 after taxes meal.... well here off-course. Plenty of comfortable seating and again the server was very friendly, food came out in a decent time and was hot! they also kept filling out water glass. 

Lunch pricing was friendly on the pocket where you get one dish with rice and spring roll or pop. I had spicy fish, which was awesome. Some of the colleagues didn't want it dry or too sassy and they did less sauce which was great. 

Spicy Fish dry - 5/5 
General Tao Chicken - 3.5/5

Overall the restaurant was clean, tables were clean, washroom were kept clean as well. Parking is not a problem as its part of a plaza. 

I kind of like this place and would definitely go again! Well I have been there twice in less than a week :)

For my Muslim folks - the entire menu is Halal and I saw their halal certification on the shelf."}
{"text":"I visited Chilli Chicken house this weekend after reading rave reviews and was disappointed.
We tried Chilli fish, Egg fried rice and Gobi Manchurian. Didn't really like any of those. Probably won't be returning.

One extra star for the owner for he was kind."}
{"text":"Thanks to fellow Yelpers I found and tried this place out.

Its very small, so I can understand it gets crowded during busy times.  But the customer service we received for take-out was fantastic!  Very friendly, they kept giving us updates on our order.

It was a good experience, especially for first impression.  As for the food, this go around was simple and basic - Chilli Chicken and Veg Noodles.  I have to say it was good.  the flavour was great (maybe a bit salty overall, but not overpowering).  The chicken was very tender..  most of these places don't have that, so its a huge plus.

Plus their prices are very reasonable.  I hate overprice, and undertaste.  That won't happen here.

Still not sure if its better than Ming Room, but I guess it doesn't matter since they're gone.  I think this will be my new Hakka place, and I'm looking forward to trying out some other dishes! :p"}
{"text":"Great place for some Hakka! My usual go-to in Mississauga is Eddie's Wok N Roll, it was nice to try something new! Personally I still prefer Eddie's but this place is delish! 

Had the chance to try it with family one night, glad they were willing to try something new too! The place was quite busy on a week night! Lots of people coming in and out for dining in and take out. Of course, with its name being Chili Chicken House, we had to order the chili Chicken! We also got veggie pakora, their house special soup (with crab, shrimp and chicken), crispy beef and manchurian fried rice. 

The chili chicken came dry or with gravy...basically their chili sauce. Sooo if you're gonna get this, get it with \"gravy\". It was really tasty! Best dish out of the ones we ordered! The server was very helpful with the menu!

The veggie pakora was really different! Nothing that I've tried before (see pics), it was really good! The dish came with 10 pieces, about the size of lemons! They were super crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. They serve it with a side of tamarind sauce. 

I'd love to come back and try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Nice variety of food. We tried fried rice, vegetarian and if course chicken menu items. The sesame chicken and pakoras were favourites, but generally everything was good. We did take out for eight people. The food was ready fast and hot. They provided a box to keep it organized.  Cash only option helps keep the price reasonable. They were able to make it without MSG, but could not complete our request to make one stir fry without any sauces (gluten free). We thought that was strange."}
{"text":"Chili Chicken House is the first place I have ever felt confident to give 5*.

Whether it's food, cleanliness, or service - it's impeccable, no doubts. 

It's the perfect place for a sit down meal, takeout, or just a back up when you don't wanna cook. 

The food is great, not super greasy for hakka cuisine, and plenty of flavour. 
The staff there seems to know all their regulars by their first names. That speaks volume. 

Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Not sure if this place is under new ownership, as the people serving were all different. Food tasted not as good as usual but maybe it was an off day. Would have given it 5 stars in the past. Favourite spot for Hakka food in Mississauga - foods good, portions are huge, and it's really well priced. Manchurian chowmein (house special) with chicken and shrimp is a classic - enough noodles to feed 4 people. Love the hot and sour soup (pictured). Spicy chicken on the chefs specials is great as well. Could do better than the manchurian beef as there's plenty to choose from. Overall a great casual place for cheap eats when you're really hungry and the service is always great. Would definitely recommend and I hope they resume to their regular quality :)"}
{"text":"*3.5 stars.

Food is good. It hits the spot, but I wouldn't say it's the best I ever had. The food isn't consistent..

The chili chicken has too much of a strong ginger taste, I love ginger but it over powers the whole dish in my opinion..

The veggie Hakka noodles are smokey, but slightly bland

In general this place is OK when you want to satisfy a craving, but it's not the best. It's also expensive."}
{"text":"Five years of yelping in the GTA hearing about the glory that is the Chili chicken house. Five years and nary have a stepped into their hallowed home. I've read nearly everyone of their 230+ reviews each making me a little hungrier and determined to get here, and then Monday I. Got. There. 

It's not a big spot and it needs a minute to be found in this plaza just north of Burnhamthorpe in Mississauga but it's worth that MB of data you'll use from you phones GPS to find it. Pro-tip, Waze and Yelp take you basically to the front door in the plaza. 

CCH is definitely a take away joint, the flow of takeout orders was steady during our visit but there's enough seating for around 30-40 people or so. 

We had a solid group of about 10 so good thing we got there prior to 6 because the DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS. 

We decided to do a family style dinner and everyone took turns ordering something of interest. From the flurry of food being tossed at my face, here's a recap of what we ordered

Won ton soup (Medium)
HotNSour Soup (Medium)
Ginger Fish
Crispy beef
Manchurian noodles
Chili chicken dry
Chili chicken w/ sauce/gravy
Fish pakoras
A mixed veggie dish (can't recall name)

And I think that's it! 

Let me just summarize rather than going into detail but EVERYDISH was amazing. Standouts for me were the Fish pakoras with what seemed like a curry sauce baked into the deep fried ball and of course the chili chicken both ways! 

The surprise course in my opinion was the ginger fish and crispy beef. Whoa! 

The sixth star was earned when we got the bill. All that food PLUS tax PLUS 15-20% tip came to ONLY $12-13/person. Seriously. At those prices I could avoid doing groceries and just eat here - and I would every damn chili chicken day of the year

EATCREST OUT!!!"}
{"text":"This place was so busy on the Friday night.  I've never been here before but it has to be good judging by how packed the place was and also by the lineup for takeout.  If I had known that it was that busy,  we would have called in to order first and then pick up the food when it was ready.  We ordered the chilli chicken with gravy,  Hakka chow mein and the szchauan eggplant.   The chilli chicken was on point and was delicious.  Next time I would order it without the gravy.   They Hakka chow mein was not oily and tasted great.  I found the eggplant a little too saucy though. The taste was fine but just too much sauce.  I'm going to try the gobi next time. Overall the food was great.  The restaurant is small so don't expect a seat if you go late.  I would just get takeout."}
{"text":"There is something about places that are quick to serve. Chilli chicken house is my go to when I want to have hakka chinese and when I want it fast. Never been disappointed with the service. 
Love the beef dishes here. Chilli beef, beef in black bean sauce, broccoli beef. The chicken dishes are good too. 
I really love their lunch and dinner specials. You can order an item off the specials menu with a side of rice and its just the right serving size and price for one person."}
{"text":"It does not get better than Manchurian Gobi + Chilli Chicken (With Gravy)  + Hakka Chow Mein - seriously it's the best.

Such a delicious spice level on everything. So much flavour. Such great textures. Everything is perfect and my mouth hurts."}
{"text":"Always great Hakka Chinese food. We order from here all the time . Chilli beef dry is highly recommended"}
{"text":"Presentation of the food was surprisingly good! We ordered Tom Yum soup, crispy beef, sweet and spicy chicken and chili calamari.  The three dishes were around 10$ and comes with rice (each dish).  The soup was very good, spicy enough not super sour.  The crispy beef was more on a sweet side and was good.  The chicken I find was average slightly dry.  The calamari was good but not was crispy as I expected.  Overall the dishes we tried were slightly above average, would Def go back and try other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Great place around the corner from me. They offer an array of hakka foods with all different levels of spice. Love the chicken pakoras here-big and meaty, more like an entree than an appetizer. Also love their butter chicken, its different-not spicy and savoury with a sweet aroma great on steamed rice. Chili chicken dry/wet both the best in town. Fung mei mein, szechuan noodles, and manchurian fried rice are my go to carbs. Honestly anything you get here will not disappoint, so long as you can handle heat."}
{"text":"Best hakka and arguably the best restaurant in Mississauga. The food is top notch and I don't know one person who does not like chili chicken house. Service is good too. Yes it is a little slow if you eat in but that is because of the sheer volume of people that come here and order food. They include rice too! 

My top recommendations: Crab Corn Soup (it's real crab!) Honey Garlic Wings, Pad Thai, Sweet and Spicy Crispy Chicken, Crispy Beef, Butter Chicken."}
{"text":"When it comes to lunch special deals I think this place is impossible to beat. Large portion of selected dish + bowl of rice + pop for just under $7 is a steal. It's like your college truck food price but you get actual restaurant quality food.

While I greatly enjoy Hakka food I don't know much about it so I usually just stick to my pakoras and manchurian meats. I believe you can order some dishes with or without gravy/heavy sauce depending on your preference but I like my food swimming in it so never asked.

The only reason I took a star off was because of seasoning. While it's good most of the time sometime I find the dish too salty compared to other times. Still good but makes me eat way more rice and drink more.

They have a pretty good deal on takeout orders as well. When you order $25 or more there was a 10% discount last time I ordered for pickup. Even when just picking up food for myself I just order a bunch and keep in the fridge since the food was good even when reheated."}
{"text":"I orderd the Szechuan beef dinner special, it was pretty good and was on the mild side..
I also ordered an order if spring rolls for here 
And they were fanrastic not too oily 

Hakka chicken/shrimp and chicken corn soup to to go

customer service was fantastic as usual"}
{"text":"Visited because of the reviews.  All I can say is the owner must be paying for reviews because the quality of the food in no way warrants anything more than a 2.  The portions are large, the food is - words fail me- nasty.  Loads of free rice, - chilli chicken - disappointing in the extreme, crispy beef?  So crispy you can't even get your teeth into it.  Miserable tiny little pieces of hard overcooked beef.  Getting stung like this makes me question yelp and trust reviews less!  This guy even has a notice on his front door about his yelp reviews. Don't believe all the good reviews here!"}
{"text":"My absolute fav hakka place in all of Mississauga! I have been to my fair share of hakka restaurants and this one is by far, the best! I love everything on their menu, but if I had to recommend a few, these would be my picks:
-Chili Chicken w/less gravy (I find if you don't specify \"less gravy\" the chicken comes swimming in sauce which ruins the taste)
-Crispy Beef
-Veggie Chow Mein
-Chili Fish (hubby's fave)
-Honey Garlic Wings are DELISH!

I'm not a fan of how small this place is, almost impossible to ever get a table and waiting outside is not the business. Usually always get takeout! Be sure to give yourself plenty of time when ordering ahead. They take quite a while to get orders done!"}
{"text":"The best HAKKA place in town. Their butter chicken and chilli chicken is the best!! Their service is great and the food is always ready quickly."}
{"text":"Overall, a good & satisfying meal. But I was a bit disappointed, as I've had waaaayyy better Hakka in the Toronto/Mississauga area and the reviews on here were stellar. 

I found the food to be overly salty and just not Hakka style - it just felt like Chinese food. It was definitely good, just didn't live up to the hype created on yelp. 

We did take out and our hosts had ordered several different dishes. However, I would have loved to try some of their other items on the menu"}
{"text":"I tried this restraunt for the first time on someone's recommendation and I must say that this is the best place for Hakka Chinese food. Once you try it you will be addicted for sure . The staff is very friendly and polite .."}
{"text":"For years I made peace with mediocre hakka across the GTA. Even the once so popular places in the east or west end lost their charm and flavour with time and popularity... 

Until now!  The hunt ends. Fresh, flavourful, delicious hakka has been found. Well actually many years ago we did get take out from here but never had a chance to come back. Now I'm kinda regretting not coming back sooner. 

We ordered three dishes so we could take some home for tomorrow. The chilli chicken was great!  The spice and pepper fish was crispy and fresh. The Manchurian noodles had the perfect amount of spice and flavour. 

Chilli Chicken House will now forever be our go to hakka place. Move over, other Wok and Rolls..."}
{"text":"came in on thursday. ordered manchurine gobi, chilli chicken dry. gobi is perfect this time! we got so addicted to it! we tried chilli chicken this time, a bit salty, otherwise good. service was great this time."}
{"text":"Good food at really good prices. I've been here twice now and both times have been consistent in quality and portion (both times at lunch). The hakka fried noodles is a fantastic deal. It's not part of their lunch menu but the portion size is a fantastic deal for the price. The chili chicken wet lunch combo is fantastic - the spices are just right. The combo comes with a spring roll or a pop, which isn't really the best of a side offering but it's a good addition to the main and rice. We usually get the spring roll, and it's a pretty generic one.

The mains are always good - there are so many we want to try when we go back. I'd gladly come back here during a dinner to try their food. The place is always busy and noisy, so be prepared to make friends with your dining neighbour! The owners are nice and the staff is always friendly. I'd say you really should give it a try if you're on the fence. It's probably the best hakka place I've tried in the GTA :o"}
{"text":"Heard good things about this place from friends and finally decided to give it a try.

There were 5 of us, so we ordered 4 dishes (1 appetizer and 3 mains) along with noodles and friend rice. The noodles and rice were average, nothing to write home about. The dishes IMO were kind of hit and miss. We had the pepper chicken for an appetizer, and it was a unanimous vote that it was delicious.

Next came the main courses, which were spicy & sweet chicken, chili chicken (of course!) and crispy beef. Out of these 3, my favorite was the spicy & sweet chicken (or was the spicy & sour chicken?). The other 2 were not something I would order again, although other friends at the table liked the dishes - so I guess it is up to personal preference.

--
I have been back to this place multiple times now as it is my go to hakka food restaurant. Absolutely amazing food and everyone I introduce this place to absolutely loves it as well. It has earned the coveted 5 stars!

Overall, I was very happy with the food and value, and will definitely be going back here and recommending this location to friends."}
{"text":"A goto place for good hakka food and reasonable price.  The Manchurian chicken in gravy sauce is the favorite."}
{"text":"I tried their food first time on my friends recommendation and I really got disappointed. The taste of their food is not too impressive. Their food is full of sodium and colour. The taste of their food is garbage compare to other good Hakka restaurants. I have been to better Hakka Chinese places like wok n roll on Erin mills and Millcreek. And their price is same as any other place. I would never go back there."}
{"text":"Average Hakka place with similar prices to others in the area. Like most other places, it's hit or miss depending on who is working in the kitchen. Their chicken pakoras are above average but not worth going out of your way for. Keep your expectations low and you'll be satisfied."}
{"text":"Not very fancy restaurant but totally loved the food and definitely going back again we tried the famous chicken chilli and manchurian beef also the fried rice all Yammuy and the portion is quite good and you can always get the rest as takeaway finally the fortune cookies at the end were very sweet treats for my family"}
{"text":"We love this place! 
we go there every couple of weeks and the quality is always consistent. 
You should definitely try the \"pepper wings\" they are amazing! 
The staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure there was any room for us to eat because it was so busy . But it had quick service and turnover and we got a seat fairly quickly. The food was delicious!!! I would definitely go again ."}
{"text":"I had the butter chicken and the sweet and spicy crispy chicken and they were both awesome. I will definitely return to try out the other items on the menu. I'm really surprised that this place isn't well known.. If you're on the west end (Mississauga), definitely drop by for a bite!"}
{"text":"Best Hakka Chinese in Mississauga. After eating here I realised how bad the otherwise top Chinese 'Jasmine' is!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food at all. Very greasy and lacking the authenticity, the food gave me stomach churn. Not going back again!"}
{"text":"This place is honestly a Sauga staple. It has some of the most diverse set of hakka food. The quantity is amazing for the price, nothing is over 10$! Every dish is made very flavourful! Most dishes are very spicy however, so if you don't like spice make sure you specify when you order. Even on busy nights they serve food very quickly.

I got the paneer dish. As far as paneer goes, I would say this dish is OKAY. The sauce was really good. Super sweet and thick with a tad of spice, just the way I like it. The actual paneer pieces were really hard I felt, and not ridiculously chewy. The dish came with a lot at least and was really filling.

I also got the panneer pakoras! Never have I seen something similar. Inside is soft and cheesy paneer but on the outside is crispy and yet chewy skin. So yummy, and all vegetarian! The sauce it comes with is so perfect, not too spicy, and very sweet. I Would warn you though the dish is very heavy, I recommend it as a dish on itself and not as an appetizer."}
{"text":"I finally made my first visit, and I had the lunch special Manchurian chicken with noodles. I also sampled my friend's chilli chicken (dry) with fried rice. Delicious, and I even noticed the meat quality seemed a bit higher than many other places. Another thing I picked up on, was that the sides were less oily than most other takeout Chinese. This was a especially true for the noodles, which were surprisingly light (not bogged down in sauce and/or oil) and had some veggies in it, such as cabbage. When I was done, I have very full - but not feeling 'heavy' - if you follow.

The dish in and of itself may be a '4'; however coming under $10 with tax - with a drink, means it's right near the top for quality in its price range. Moreover, from the dishes I saw of those dinning in, and the user-submitted photos on this page, I'm fairly confident it will remain a '5' overall when dinning in or placing a larger order.

I also appreciated the very friendly customer service, which in theory, they wouldn't have to worry about given their popularity. Yet they never gave a sense of being rushed in spite of a lineup, made eye contact and wished me a happy weekend.

I shall return...oh yes...I shall return. Crispy beef and chilli calamari: I'm coming for you."}
{"text":"Had the chilli chicken based on reviews on Yelp. It was the best chilli chicken I have ever had. The chicken tasted great, the portion was huge! Service was also good and food prepare in a timely manner. I would recommend!"}
{"text":"Soooo good!! Have been going here for over a year now after my last Hakka Chinese restaurant went downhill. The food is always consistent and delicious. My faves are the Hakka chow mein, the chicken pakoras, and the crispy beef (to die for), I've also had the Wonton soup, Manchurian chicken, general Tao (with broccoli in it, kinda odd)  and manchurian noodles (my least favorite). It is a small restaurant that fills up fast so I tend to do take out during their rush hours."}
{"text":"We are a regular diners at this place, and have found it to be one of the most consistent places to have Hakka Chinese. I have stopped going to the biggies of Mississauga ever since. Their hot n sour soup, dry beef, chilli chicken, chop suey (request spicy), and at times have requested variations in their existing items. I must say that their chef knows his cooking, and honors request without a flaw. I'd easily give them a 5 star if they could expand the seating capacity."}
{"text":"Tried this place as the yelp reviews were good.  Service is attentive.  Food is good.  Hakka noodle dish was a generous mound of tasty noodles.  Crispy beef  was good as was the veggie pakoras.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food is great but costumer service lacks a bit especially on the phone. It can be extremely difficult to reach them on the phone when they're short staffed BUT their famous chilli chicken with gravy on steamed rice makes up for it. Its so spicy that I cry while eating but that's how I like it!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the food was quite good.  Between me and my friends, we ordered the butter chicken, the crispy beef, and the lemon chicken.  The butter chicken was my favourite dish - it was really creamy, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The crispy beef was delicious and had a hint of spiciness, but there was a pretty strong ginger taste, so it's not for everyone.  The lemon chicken was flavourful, but nothing spectacular.  

The price is reasonable for their portion sizes, which are huge.  We ordered three extra bowls of rice, which was a mistake because they pack these big bowls full.  Overall, a delightfully surprising find that I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Was craving Hakka and this was the closest place that had a great rating, so we decided to check it out. Amazing service! They said it would be a 15 minute wait before we got seated, but the waiter saw how hungry we were by the look on our faces and seated us within minutes since there was just two of us. The food came in quick and the waitresses would always take our finished plates off right away to make more room. Good chilli chicken (had to try this cause of the restaurant's name) and great rice and pakoras too! Would definitely come back here if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"Crispy beef, chilly chicken, dry Manchurian chicken are winners!! The place is always busy - no matter day or time ..."}
{"text":"The food is seriously good. 

We got the chicken pakoras, crab corn soup, house fried rice, chilli chicken with gravy and American chop suey. 

We went on Mother's Day and luckily we got a reservation so skipped the wait entirely. 

Overall a good experience with decent service."}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time and the food was amazing.  I ordered the dry chilli chicken and the dry okra.   I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We came here for boxing day (Dec 26th) for dinner time around 6ish.  The place was sort of busy when we arrived, sat down and ordered.

By the time we ordered the restaurant was at capacity.  People were coming in and out in hordes and walking away with multiple bags in each hand.  This place on the 26th was BUSY!  I couldn't believe how many people were coming in and out I swear it was like a McDonald's.

We were a table of 5 and we had ordered spring rolls (3 orders of 2 each) so we basically were supposed to get 6.  Well they must have known they were going to be very busy and they gave us double our order for just the price of 3 orders.  They must have known we'd be waiting a really long time for our food.  We also ordered pad thai noodles, vegetable fried rice, chili chicken (dry), chicken pakora and a crispy beef dish.

We did have to wait a long time after the pakora came out which was a HUGE serving of 10 pieces.  The food when it finally came out was great.  We all ate as much as we could and were enjoying the flavorful dishes.  The chili chicken since it was the namesake of the establishment you'd expect it to be their signature dish... well it was.  I enjoyed it as while it was spicy it wasn't too hot and very full of flavor.  

The food was very good, it just took a long time to come out because perhaps they weren't used to getting that many people coming in to dine or taking out?  Maybe they are used to that I don't know it was my first time but regardless it did take some time for the food to be served."}
{"text":"I have tried many many many chili chicken places.

This is by far the best chili chicken place in Mississauga.  [ Make sure you get dry & spicy ]
I must say, the moment you take a bite into the chicken, the perfect tenderness of the chicken just teases you for some more.
If you love chili chicken, this is the place to go.
The other food is really good too, but make sure you get that chili chicken."}
{"text":"Great place for Hakka cuisine though can sometimes be hit and miss. The chicken, soups, and noodle/rice dishes usually do not disappoint especially manchurian chicken and the shrimp noodles. However, the beef gravy we bought last time was on the smellier side and almost inedible. The only beef dish I like here is crispy beef but stay away from the other ones. Servers are nice and always come to refill your glass of water before its empty. The restaurant itself is tiny. They have a larger room in the back for big get togethers and we've never had a problem booking the tables for our large family. Overall, a wonderful place to go every once in a while with the family when the mood for Hakka strikes."}
{"text":"Two words: absolutely spectacular! Saw the reviews for this place and I thought I'd like to challenge them. Turns out I'm with everyone for this one. This place is absolutely fantastic, food and service wise. Waltz in thinking it would just be like any regular place, but took me by surprise. The gentleman (I presume was the owner) greeted my friends and I instantly upon entering the door. He politely directed us to our table and asked us what we wanted to drink. This man was spot on in terms of service quality. He made sure we were taken cared of before he took other people's orders. So awesome.. 

The food quality was great, fresh and cooked to perfection. The taste was perfect, not too salty nor was it too spicy. The place is called Chili Chicken House, so I had to try the chilli chicken with gravy. Other orders were the chili fish with gravy, veggie beef with gravy and chicken pakora. I had a bite from every dish and they were either on par or better than Nando's and Frederick. My dish was totally heaven. I could not measure how delightful each bite was because the flavour I got from it dazzled my mouth/taste buds - purest form of foodgasm. Each bite was spicy, yet bearable. The onions added a tang to it and each bite was crunchy.. Nommmms! The other dishes I will review next time I visit. I hope soon because portion to size to taste to price was  we also ordered a corn/crab meat soup. Thought it would come with imitation crab meat you get at asian grocery stores, but we were so wrong! The crab meat was real, pulled from each leg. We were actually kind of shocked that it came with real meat. Word..

I would like to give this place full 5 stars, but the speed of the kitchen was not cool. So 4.5 stars will do.. They seemed to put take out orders the priority and dine in customers were second. While we were seated, 3 families ordered take out and got their food quicker than us. We waited at least 15+ minutes for the food.

If you are ever around, I highly, highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I did take out once to try their dry chilli chicken. The chicken was spicy and pretty average like most chilli chicken...not bad by any means. Being hakka, it is pricier than most chinese places. The meal came with a bowl of rice, I can't really say I enjoyed it all that much. The rice was very dry to the point of cumbling and made everything so much more dry. I would've been happier with just the chicken. The service was quite fast so it'll be a nice easy quick meal, great option for take out night. For regular, run of the mill, chinese dishes I'd go down the plaza for other cheaper and better alternatives."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was very food. A lot of food for the money. Was full just from eating the shrimp pakora which is an appetizer."}
{"text":"Updated for 2016-10-10
The management has changed and so is the food. For the price they charge, it is not worth

Picked up a Szechuan Fried Rice, Vegetarian Manchurian, a Hakka Noodle and a Mixed Vegetable with Tofu to go. The order took 40 minutes as it was extremely busy. I was notified of the same. But the person who took the order was not customer friendly. 

The Fried way too red, perhaps with colour added, the Manchurian Balls were too soft, the vegetables were OK and the noodles too greasy. 

Not coming back

Originally reviewed on 2015-02-15

Picked up a medium Manchurian Soup, veggie fried rice, veggie chow mien, veggie Manchurian and paneer chilli. A box full of plain rice also came included (the quantity was a lot). 

The soup was good and spicy and was still hot till we had at home. The fried rice was nice and so were the rest of dishes. The chilli paneer was a bit spicy for the kids. 

The only downside was that there was a piece of transparent plastic bag that came in one of the dishes - most likely in the rice or veggie Manchurian."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place tonight.
Food was good and reviews helped guide our order.

Shrimp pakoras - Awesome! Best I've had in GTA. Yep, loaded with shrimp pieces, thus my 4 stars!

Chilli chicken dry - yum, spicy, savoury

Crispy beef - tastey, spicy, slightly sweet

Crispy eggplant - never had it like this, great, savoury

Good size portions. Price is average. Spicy level may be more than expected. Food is quite salty and amount of MSG added may be on the higher end (allergy alert)."}
{"text":"Uhh, the sauce they have taste exactly like a chinese brand instant noodle packet: \" ??? ????? \" , It was so salty and horrid that we could finish one dish and left."}
{"text":"This place is soo damn amazing. It has the Hakka food in town! Their chicken Manchurian is one the best dishes. Great service and once again excellent food"}
{"text":"Average haka Chinese place. More meant as a take out. ONLY accept cash or debit. NO Credit Cards. So come prepared."}
{"text":"Why did I go to this place?  Because of all the great reviews here on Yelp and I must admit that for those that rated it 4 or 5 stars were right. 

I would have liked to put 4.5 stars because 5 stars would mean perfection but this place is pretty darn close. 

I went there on a Friday night with friends and we ordered the Singapore noodles, Szechuan chicken, pad Thai and the crispy beef and it was all very delicious!  With how busy they were (awesome to see local businesses doing so well), they food came out very quickly and was hot like it came right off of the stove. The staff were very courteous, friendly and efficient and even took people's orders while they stood in line instead of waiting for them to get to the counter. 

Room for improvement?  They need a bigger place. It was a bit tight when trying to eat at your table and other patrons are standing within 3 ft of you because the line up for ordering went down the middle of the tables. 

Aside from space which would be a nice to have other than a need to have, I would definitely go back to the Chilli Chicken House!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short. Checked this place out for the first time this evening and was thoroughly impressed. Extremely delicious dishes, each laced with a distinct blend of flavours. Will definitely be stopping here more often in the near future. The owners/servers are also really friendly and down to earth people."}
{"text":"I changed my mind.  I've come back a few times since my last review and have had the chili chicken (dry), butter chicken and hot and sour soup too.  The dry chilli chicken is delicious.  However, what I really like about this place is their service, even for takeout.  In most cases, when you order takeout, you just sit there and wait.  While you wait here, they are nice enough to offer you a glass of water. I know water is free, but it's those little gestures that I really appreciate.  

During one of most recent visits, I had butter chicken and hot and sour soup.  I've never had butter chicken from a Hakka place before and I was hesitant, but it was listed under \"Chef speciality\", so I had to try it.  While it wasn't the typical orange butter chicken we have here (it was a dark red), it was absolutely divine.  It actually had a nice aroma and you could taste the butter and spices.  It wasn't spicy and maybe it's not what I'm used to, but it doesn't matter. It was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good!  And all dinner entrees come with rice so the butter chicken with rice was such a delicious combo.  I got up with the intention of getting tacos this morning, but now that I am writing this review, I am conflicted lol.  

As for the hot and sour soup, it had plenty of tofu and veggies and chicken (I think), and while spicy, it had a good flavour to it.  Probably one of the best hot and sour soups I've had.  

Overall, while this place is slightly small for Mississauga standards, it's probably one of the best hidden secrets in the area! Done salivating yet? Just go there.  Peace out."}
{"text":"Food is okay but I find all of their dishes pretty salty. Prices are relatively high, although the portion is good. I have only dined in there once so I can't really rate their services. However, I have ordered take out a couple of times and I have noticed that their rice isn't that good. The rice is always very mushy so I have to toss it and make new rice.  

Two dishes I order often are shrimp pakoras and chillie chicken(dry). I order from there whenever I can't think of a place to get takeout from."}
{"text":"Best Hakka in Toronto.  Thank you so much for the amazing food and service.   Quit reading and go eat there !!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good. Service could be better. Everything arrives fast. Meat quality could be better.

Overall a good hakka selection in Mississauga."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed in food. We ordered the dry chili chicken and Manchurian noodles. Order came out quick. I just can't believe how a dish so colourful and fragrant be so bland. The chili chicken was flavourful but not as I expected. It was well seasoned but I cannot say the seasonings complimented each other. Customer service was good, price is good, food did not live up to its hype. Will not be back and would not recommend. The only thing we wanted more of was the fortune cookie."}
{"text":"Got the chili chicken (gravy) - not bad, not overly flavourful. 
The Manchurian chow mein - average at best, loaded with food coloring and taste wasn't anything to write home about. 

Likely won't be returning, the east side (Scarborough) has MUCH better Hakka places."}
{"text":"My brother recommended that I try this place after he had gone several times and was consistently impressed. 

My table ordered a plate of butter chicken, chili chicken in gravy (they give you the option between gravy and dry), which both came with a heaping amount of rice on the side. Note- it doesn't mention that rice is included on the side with meat dishes, so keep this in mind when ordering your dish! We also ordered a lunch special, chili shrimp with rice on the side, and a can or pop. All of this after tip cost around $37.

I really enjoyed everything!  My favourite was probably the butter chicken. I found the chili chicken just a tad bit too spicy. If you find you can't really handle a lot of spice in your food, try to steer clear of the green peppers included in the chili chicken/shrimp dishes. 

Also good to mention - the service was great. Received our dishes within a reasonable amount of time and they were friendly as well!
Furthermore, if you're planning to order take-out, if you pay with cash, you'll receive 10% off!

Great authentic flavours here in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Got takeout today, after a long time and was shocked by how busy it was (1hr wait; although I don't think it is this bad on most days) 
Ordered vegetable chow mein, hot garlic chicken and veg. machurian. 
All the food was in very good quantity (expensive but worth it) 
everything was amazingly tasty. 
I have been to this place over half a dozen times in the last two years and this place always impresses."}
{"text":"I had take out from this place yesterday. Ordered the chilli chicken dry, manchurian beef with gravy and the Bombay fish.  The food is decent and the service was above average.  I did not like the chilli chicken dry, it was not juicy and it was hard.  I do love the manchurian beef though.  It is soft and top quality, not chewy like many Chinese take-out restaurants.  The Bombay fish was okay, but could use more flavouring.  The food needed a little something more to distinguish it from the other. They seem to be all mildly spiced. (I ordered extra spicy, it was just semi-spicy). I think if the food had a little more herbs, some parsley, cilantro it would make the food a lot better.  Food wise, this is a three and a half.  Washroom was clean and service was above average, so that's a 4/5.  The food is just ok but service and place is good, so it's in between a yay ok and I'm a fan, but I'll err on the nicer side and give this place a full four stars."}
{"text":"Great Chili chicken

Had the dry with noodles as suggested by a fellow yelper and was very enjoyable, would return weekly if the drive was a little more forgiving time wise, will try to call ahead so food is ready when I get there next time and maybe I can make it a weekly staple while I am in the area on a regular basis for the time being"}
{"text":"This is my second time here and I have to say it's one the best Hakka places I've been to in a long time. Their chicken pakoras are really good! My favourite dish is their chili beef/chicken both with sauce and dry! Their chowmein noodles are really good as well.  The staff is friendly and both times that I have been here it has been quite busy. You may have to wait a few minutes longer then you'd like for your food but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Best Chilli chicken with gravy ever!!! You get what you pay for. Huge portion and super spicy. I love this place."}
{"text":"Today was my third time at this place.  First time, I tried the Pakora Chicken.  It has a unique taste, but over rated and over priced; it was $14 with tax.  Second time, I ate something I cannot even remember other than the fact that I did not like it.

I gave it a third shot today, as I really wanted to like this place - this place is obviously popular by the rating it gets.

I asked the waitress for the most popular dish.  She told me to order the Chilli chicken, wet style - with gravy.   It tasted like bad cheap Chinese food at a cheap neighborhood.  I just don't get it.  I don't get why this place is popular and can get away with charging plenty of $$$.

This was my last and final time I visit this establishment.   Only thing it has going for is the fact that  food at this place has plenty of spices, sauces, and almost everything on the menu is fried food.

{"text":"Amazing food and great service from owners.  I've eaten at the restaurant and got take out often and the people that work there are soo nice. The food is also amazing- chilli chicken (dry), butter chicken, pakoras, manchurian fish, crispy chicken and Hakka noodles are very delicious.  Portions and price is also very fair.  Cash will also give you 10%off - Highly recommended!!!!

Food: 5/5 (best Hakka food I've had in the GTA - great flavour, portions and presentation) 

Service: 4/5 (the owners are very nice, always smiling and when you eat there, they definitely give you attention to make sure you have everything - I wish they would take credit cards though)

Ambience: 3.5/5 (nothing special but small and homey)

Price: 3.5/5 (not too expensive or cheap - similar to other Asian joins in the area)"}
{"text":"Really great food. Portion size and quality for price was very fair. I had the chili chicken dinner special, dry with hakka noodles which were so delicious and a spring roll. We didn't have to wait too long for the food. You could tell it was fresh. The chicken was spicy but not unbearable.. If you want more spice you have two sauces they give you to add but unless you like your mouth on fire I wouldn't recommend them. I'm only taking off one star because it was my first visit and I only had the one dish but will amend my review once I try a couple other dishes and can see the food quality is consistent."}
{"text":"Finallllllly got to try this place out yesterday night on an impromptu date with the bf. We drove originally to Anathan for their lamb rolls but sadly their Yelp hours were wrong. 

So my bf asked for saucy meat with rice...bingo!!!! So I got to share my wonderful knowledge of Hakka food with him and sold him before we even arrived. We snagged the last table and right from the beginning we felt welcomed. Being that it was almost 9pm and the place was packed, we knew we were in for a treat! The staff (every one of them) were kind and on point! Water was always filled and food came out hot and proper. 

The food was delicious (hot and sour soup and chili chicken with gravy)! My mouth is still watering from the gravy. The portion size was great, filled 2 of us plus leftovers for lunch! It did have spice to it, but not over powering. 

I'll have to go back to try their other dishes because everything smelled great. When paying we put down a 20 and the tip in change, the owner (manager???) still asked if we need change before thanking us. It was a small but for me significant gesture. I feel like for them it's really about the food!

A place to write home about :)"}
{"text":"Really good hakka food in Mississauga, perhaps the best. Unfortunately seating is very limited so you may need to do take out. If you do want to get seating, either call ahead or arrive near closing time.

You must try the chilli chicken/beef/fish (all dry), fried calamari, and Szechwan rice, all really good with generous servings. If you love spicy food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"A great little Hakka restaurant in the heart of Mississauga. We always order the chilli chicken with the chicken fried rice. We get the order saucy. The food is consistently good with a touch of spice. My husband is Indian and he goes through withdrawal symptoms if he hasn't visited this place in a while. The orders are decently sized (good to serve family style). The staff is always nice when we call in our order over the phone. And the food left overs (if there is any) reheat well and taste great the next day. Overall a good place for Hakka food."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after the 10:30 Sunday Mass.. It supposedly opened at 12, and we got there at 11:30 so we decided to do a little grocery shopping while we waited.

Got in quarter after 12 and there were about 3 tables in already! We snatched a table and ordered up.  I got the Chili Calamari, my sister got General Tso Chicken, and my Mother the Pad Thai.  

I found all 3 dishes to be quite delicious! The Calamari was rather salty, and had a good amount of heat, the Pad Thai was delightfully sweet and spicy, and the General Tso chicken wasn't JUST deep fried batter like many other places.  You could actually feel yourself biting into a nice hearty chunk of chicken.  

Unfortunately, I'm not the greatest with spicy food so I was often in need of water, which the waiter was more than happy to refill...4 times.  

My sister unexpectedly took in a piece of chili disguised as chicken (the thick red sauce made it indistinguishable from the chicken), and it practically K.O'd her.

All in all, I really enjoyed the place! The food was a little pricey, and I think I like the chili squid from Dixie Park a little better. 

I'll be back next time to try the Pakoras!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing Hakka restaurant. I totally wish I took a picture of the takeout spread we got for $109, including tax. We fed eight adults plus had extras for at least three more meals after that. $109! I didn't know chickens and cows came that cheap . (That got dark). 

The best part was, the restaurant was super on top of allergies. Someone in my party squad had an egg allergy, and the chef called me back twice in advance, ran through the items I requested and pointed out which dishes had egg, which dishes he could specifically modify, and which dishes he would recommend substituting. He also helped us pick a kick ass menu for a group. So awesome, super, super delicious food, and the service and price were out of this world. We went on a Saturday afternoon to grab the food and the place was packed. Not a hidden gem -- chili chicken house is untapped across Mississauga and Toronto. This is definitely the Hakka spot. A huge, flashy, well-deserved gem.

We ordered:
Gobi Manchurian (yum)
Crisp Beef (YUM)
Shrimp and fish pakoras (SO YUM)
Shrimp and chicken rice (yum)
Hakka chow mein noodles (yu)
Chili chicken with gravy (YUM)

All variations of yum. Lots of it. Really tasty and great spot with an unbelievable taste."}
{"text":"Went to this place last Saturday, there was a line-up and we had to wait about 10 minutes before we got our table. 
I had been to this place before, but did not eat their as it was packed :(
However, this time me and my wife decided to wait and try their food. This place mentions their food to be \"indian hakka\", and they did not disappoint. 

I ordered
- Chicken Pakora
- Bombay Fish
- Hakka Noodles(without shrimp)
- Chilli Chicken.
We also got complementary steamed rice. 
Food was amazing, both of us couldnt finish everything as the food quantity per plate was decent for 2. 
Loved the noodles and chicken pakora.
Fish tasted fresh and very soft :)

Would like to recommend this place as a \"Definitive To-Try once\".
Best of luck to the restaurant staff!!"}
{"text":"I've always been curious about this place as I'm a long-time customer of Bubble Republic (tea shop next door). Finally got a chance to eat there through a recommendation. Wasn't disappointed.

I've noticed that it's always been quite packed, regardless of time. I'm sure it's a very popular place. 

The owners and staff are very kind, and they even remembered my cousin (who recommended the place to me). 

We had the Manchurian Beef, Chilli Chicken (dry), and Shrimp & Chicken Fried Rice, with an order of Hot & Sour Soup to start.

The Hot & Sour Soup was amazing. Spiced to perfection and had many pieces of chicken in it. It was really good.

The fried rice was also great. Generously portioned. Not much to say about it as it's a fairly standard dish, but that's definitely a positive. 

Next came the Manchurian Beef. I'm a huge fan of Manchurian Chicken but ordered the beef for the sake of not ordering all chicken dishes. It was my favourite part of the meal. The sauce is just great.

Lastly the Chilli Chicken. I probably should've ordered it with sauce, but it wasn't bad. It didn't seem as fresh as the other dishes, but I still enjoyed it. 

Each person is also given a bowl of steamed rice to go with their meals.

For 2, this meal was way too much food, so order accordingly!"}
{"text":"Eh, it's okay. Just a regular hakka place. Not extremely clean, but is any hakka place ever very clean? It's quite busy with a good turnover in customers. The service is fast."}
{"text":"Nice place for GTA standards but their food was filled with mSG! Good quantities though."}
{"text":"I used to always come to this Plaza to go to Bubble Republic, or Pheonix restaurants and I never noticed this place.

I normally don't eat Hakka food that often, so I never thought to try this place, until a friend suggested it.
Their dry chili chicken is probably one of the best I've had.  It was just the right spicy (on the spicy side), and it wasn't soggy at all, which I hate when I am eating chili chicken.  I definitely have to have a big glass of water with me when I'm eating this.
I also tried this other chicken dish, which was a fried chicken that was a bit sweet and was a deep red in colour.  It was amazing!  I can't recall the name of it right now."}
{"text":"Since my last review I have been back here many times and my love for their food still remains. This is as authentic as it gets.....I was told the owners were really chinese immigrants who were settled in Calcutta (where hakka cuisine originated), and now are serving these plates of explosive flavour in a hidden away plaza off burnhamthorpe and creditview. I love this place as it never dissapoints."}
{"text":"I must have amnesia because I could have sworn I already reviewed this place but I guess I haven't....

Anyways, I really enjoy Hakka food mainly cause its fun to say and its different. I would recommend the crispy eggplant (dry), it will change the way you think about eggplants. It's the way that it's cooked and seasoned that make it so awesome. It's also a generous amount so you can share with other peeps. I have also tried the Manchurian paneer, which was quite tasty."}
{"text":"I was here recently it was  a mixed bag. It was a Holiday - Family Day and they were busy with so few places open on a Holiday. 

Still.... almost 1 hour get to the food ? 
After the 45 minutes ... they finally at least bought the soup. The dry chilli chicken was was luke warm. 
I know they usually do a better job. Maybe I'm still a \"Fredrick's\" guy."}
{"text":"Every time I come here I know I will be satisfied. The food here is delicious and generous amount for the dollar. Recommend trying if you are in sauga."}
{"text":"Theres not much more to be said other than that this restaurant is my go to hakka chinese food and is a fan favourite for all my friends and family. 

I always order the manchurian gobi, its fried cauliflower covered in amazing spices and never dissapoints. I also recommend the spice and pepper wings and manchurian fried rice, these two items come in large portions big enough for a family of four. 

I'd also recommend order take out and paying in cash as theres a 10% cash discount. In addition, weekend dinner time can get super busy, pick up times can go up to 45 minutes!"}
{"text":"I had my first Hakka cuisine experience at Chilli Chicken House when I was at Mississauga recently. I was really amazed by the food. It was a spicier version of chinese food and tasted a little like south asian cuisine. Loved their chicken pakora!  The shrimp pakora was wonderful too and the pakora had generous amount of shrimps! We ordered the Spicy Shrimp, Manchurian Chicken with the Thai fried rice. I love my food really spicy so I loved the Spicy Shrimp. 
To me the Manchurian Chicken sauce seemed the blander version of the Spicy Shrimp sauce so it was my least favorite of all the food ordered that day.
Kids seemed happy with their Pad Thai and Hakka Rice Noodles.

The owner and workers were very friendly, helpful and checked on our group frequently. Oh, it is a cash only service.
Decor was just ok but it was neat and clean and living in southern California i have seen worse.

Definitely 5 stars for the food and service."}
{"text":"Great food and reasonably priced.  It's always packed but I won't go there if it's cold because you need to keep your coat on."}
{"text":"Terrible chicken quality. Had the sweet and spicy chicken, chili chicken, Cantonese style noodles with chicken, and Manchurian chicken. All had the same issue. It was so gross that we left hungry."}
{"text":"Awesome indo-chinese flavour. Great portions! Loved all veggies - veg chowmein, manchurian pakora as well as cheese chilly! Definitely, this is going to be on my list for sometime!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Chilli Chicken House after a friend highly, highly recommended the Chilli Chicken.  My friends and I placed an order for pickup about 30 minutes before their posted closing time and were there to pick it up about 15 minutes later.  Our food was ready to go when we got there and the place was surprisingly busy. It was nice to see that although they were going to be closing soon none of the many customers who were sitting at the tables were being rushed in any way.   In fact, my friend wanted to place another order and instead of being given a flat out no because of the time, the girl who was helping us offered to go check how long the dish would take to prepare.  We didn't end up placing the additional order but the gesture was much appreciated.  The great customer service definitely makes up for the not so great food - my friends and I had the chilli chicken with gravy and the general tao chicken.  I was a little disappointed in both to be honest since both dishes were fairly bland.  The food was good, but I definitely expected a lot more flavor.   The portion sizes are very, very generous and the customer service was great.  I wouldn't rush back to get the chilli chicken with gravy or the general tao chicken, but I'd definitely go back and try something else."}
{"text":"WoW ...is the Only word for this place !!
Seriously WoW.....I'm a huge fan of Hakka Food ,
And tried alot of different t places ...
This is by Far the best place I have ever had ! 
I wish i can write a bad review just to scare people away so I can always get a table with my friends as this place gets busy ...but it's to Good of a place to keep a secret ...Way to go to the owner and chef to keep things fresh and full of flavor ...You can truly taste the quality and passion in the food ! 
Try the manchurian fish dry it's to die for .
The manchurian rice , The chilli chicken with gravy .
Just eat everything it's all amazing .
5 + Stars to this place 
2 Thumbs up
Amazing !"}
{"text":"First time today for lunch with a friend. Delicious crispy beef and pad Thai! We will be back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been here many times. Butter chicken is my always order. This time we also ordered chilli chicken(I didn't really like it), ginger beef(a little hard, tasted like beef jerky) and deep fried eggplant( very well done, tasted awesome). The service was as usual fast and great. It was nice they offered a plate for the baby. We were pretty happy dining here."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from my colleagues at work who go here frequently. They highly recommended it so I took my family on the weekend.  Very glad I did.  We tried the spring rolls and tom yum soup, crispy beef and chilly chicken. This place is small but it's definitely one of my top picks for hakka in Mississauga (The food quality here is on par with Eddie's Wok & Roll) Good Job Guys!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, they serve hakka chinese food. 

Food is great, they make their own noodles, menu is huge but we have found our favourites.

Staff is courteous and friendly, owner frequently comes to your table to fill water and ask about food.

their crispy beef, red noodles and american chopsuey is my favourite. Four people can dine under $60"}
{"text":"Very tasty food. First time eating Hakka cuisine. Weather your craving Chinese or Indian food, this place will suite you well. 
Great pricing, Decent service, Great portions, Great flavours!"}
{"text":"Good Hakka food with many options. The location isn't the best - it's a small place Witt limited seating inside a strip mall. 
Has the chili chicken and Gobi manchurian. This 30 min detour was well worth the drive.
They only accept cash or Canadian debit cards."}
{"text":"Believe the hype...  This place is excellent.  Over the last several months we've been trying all the major hakka places in Peel..  They range from really bad (New China Garden in Brampton) to really good (Bombay Chopsticks, Guddu's Chili Chicken in Brampton, and now Chilli Chicken House) and this place is right at the top 2.

The best crispy beef I've tried to date -- it even tops Bombay Chopsticks version, which I've been proclaiming as the best ever for years now.  Their chilli chicken is delicious and not insanely spicy so even people with milder palates like my wife can appreciate it.

My recommendations - Crispy beef, Chili Chicken, Pakora, Hakka chow mein (vegetarian).  If dining in, get the chili chicken \"gravy\" version.  If doing take out, do the \"dry\" version, because the gravy version gets too mushy from steaming in the bag during take-out

one warning though -- the food comes out SLOW.  But I can't fault them for it because they are obviously cooking to order, and it always comes out piping hot and delicious.  Just do not dine here if you're in a hurry - they've told me it's a 15 minute wait before when they are busy, and it was over 30 minutes.  The food is worth the wait though.  The older man, the owner  I presume who is ALWAYS there, is a good guy and even gives complimentary water and fortune cookies while you're waiting for your food without you even having to ask.

5/5 from me"}
{"text":"Best chilli chicken in Mississauga and you can't go wrong with or without gravy . Hakka chowmein, butter chicken, ginger beef all bomb. I've dined in and done takeout and it's always great quality and friendly service. 

Been coming for over 5 years and I'm not stopping any time soon just don't change a thing !"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to this place given the high star rating in Mississauga, was quite disappointed. Overall, great and attentive service, price is very affordable, but food is not very authentic in my opinion. 

The chicken was juicy, rice was fine, spring roll was crunchy and light, everything was in line. But harsh to say, this place reminded me of a westernized Asian location. Similar to Man Chu Wok or Panda Express, or something of the like where there was a lot of sweet and sour or overdressed and marinated dishes. Tasty and flavorful, but not delicate. Large portions for those looking for a filling plate and comes with your choice of a drink or spring roll during lunch specials. Service was quick, reliable, and very friendly. Unfortunately not somewhere I would return for the food, but if you're looking for a quick and filling lunch to do the job, this could be your gig."}
{"text":"Just an update.  Owner of the restaurant private messaged me asking me what my order was.  I told him we had ordered fried rice, noodles, chili chicken, and momos *which were written on menu but not available*
Anyways he told me they never served momo....indirectly telling me I am lying. Then he says \"i read your reviews, nothing else to say, i feel sorry for you\" LOL are you serious? As a restaurant \"owner\" you should be a bit more professional and learn to take criticism.  Instead of resolving the problem, he just made it worse.....good luck !!!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Mississauga and my favorite Hakka restaurant I've been to so far. I highly recommend the Pad Thai and Butter Chicken. Every time I've come back to this place the food has always been made consistently well. The value in this place is incredible you're really getting your money's worth and the portion sizes can be generous.

Service is really friendly and servers are pretty welcoming. They do not hesitate to refill your water and are attentive. If you're willing to try a new place or are in the Mississauga area this place is a must."}
{"text":"If you in the mood of spicy food, they can make that happen. Food is yummy, service is good. Price is ok."}
{"text":"The manchurian noodles are AMAZING! Definitely a must if you've never tried this place before. Reasonably priced, huge portions. I was planning on saving leftovers for the next day but ended up eating all of it because it was so good."}
{"text":"Awesome service! Awesome food!

Highly recommend shrimp pakora, chilli chicken & fried rice. 

Definitely will be going back here again. My family absolutely loves the food here."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new Hakka restaurant ever since I had to change jobs. Boy did I find a great place. The Chilli Chicken House cooks some great Hakka. I started with my favourites, Manchurian Beef and Pakora. They definitely lived up to expectations. The beef was cooked well and the sauce was fantastic. To be truthful it's not exactly the same as my previous Hakka joint but it's so close I'm really nit picking here.
The pakoras were moist and flavourful and huge. These were exactly the same as my old Hakka joint.
All in all it's a great place. A nice atmosphere, cozy seating. My only recommendation would be that if you are going to get take out call a head to order if only so that you don't take up space in their dinning room. I look froward to trying other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Pretty good but watch the spice level if you're like me and are a baby about spiciest!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to places. The portion sizes are great. I usually get the crispy beef, butter chicken and hot and sour soup, which all comes with rice. The flavour is always on point here. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Hakka Chinese places I have visited. The staff, quality/quantity of food were all A+, if I lived near this restaurant I would visit every week to get a glimpse of all they have to offer. To start We ordered Manchurian soup and shrimp pakora which were both very very good. The Pakoras stood out as they were nice n hot, ample shrimp, crunch and just tasted real good. We also got an order of wings which were ok nothing to rave about. For many course we went all out with Manchuria fried rice, scezchuan noodles, chilli chick, Bombay beef(my favorite) & fish hot garlic. Everything was perfect!!!! The food just stood out so well and the service we got from our waitress complimented everything. On a final note something that stood to me were the \"regular customers\" everyone was well received and noticed some just walking in to say hello to the owners. You don't see that often but when you do you know it's special. Great management and Great food. Hopefully I can visit again in the near future"}
{"text":"Hakka Advice (as stated by Tanya G.):

Advice No. 1: If someone claims that Hakka food is just Indian/Chinese fusion, ignore everything they have to say thereafter because they are either uninformed, stupid, or lacking taste buds. Authentic Hakka food is made by Hakka Han people (Chinese people who migrated to other places, including India).  

Advice No. 2: If the owners/proprietors of a Hakka restaurant are Chinese, and they happen to have a slight/strong Indian accent, this is a good sign that the food will be delicious. Refer to Advice No. 1 to understand the relevance.

Advice No. 3: If the owners/proprietors of a Hakka restaurant are Indian, this means that they're most likely trying to get in on the Hakka food scene, and what you're actually eating is Indian-Chinese fusion or their attempt at Hakka food. More than likely, it'll be crap. Refer to Advice No. 1 to understand the relevance.

Advice No. 4: Have cash on hand. Many places will take debit cards, but most Asians prefer to deal with cash, so simplify your life, and theirs. 

Chilli Chicken House (CCH) is so legit that my mouth is watering right now thinking about the meals that I've had. It's been 24 hours since my last CCH experience, and already it seems too long. The fact that this place is now 1200+ miles (1900+ km for you Canucks) away is only adding to my depressed state of mind.

Their lunch special is $5.75, and includes an entrée, rice (or fried rice/noodles for a little extra), and a spring roll. The spring roll is nothing special, but it goes well enough with everything else. I have now tried the Manchurian Chicken, Chili Chicken, Manchurian Fish, Szechuan Fish, Shrimp Pakora, and Fish Pakora. Everything. Is. Delicious. Obviously, it's not the healthiest fare, and I suppose if you want it to be slightly healthier, you could ask that the entrée be made dry instead of with sauce, but sauce is the magic yo.

If there is one thing that you must absolutely have though, it's the Shrimp Pakora. They are amazeballs. No seriously, they're actually balls filled with amaze. Top it off with a little bit of that garlicky/gingery hot sauce they have on the table and it's just... ::pantomimes head exploding::

Service is amazing. Frequent checks by all staff, smiles all around, and even after the meal was paid for, the water glasses kept getting filled. Well done sir(s). Well done. I'm going to say that if you don't like this place, you're probably a terrible person."}
{"text":"Best Hakka place in the city! It's one of those restaurants where I always get the same thing because they are consistently sooooo good: chilli chicken with gravy, Hakka chow mien, and their gobi Manchurian. I've also tried like everything else on the menu and trust me, those three are the go-tos. 

The service here is also fantastic! If you come here often they'll remember you and there's cash discounts for purchases above 25 bucks--what more can you ask for??"}
{"text":"First time trying Chinese Indian Hakka foodhouse. I had the Szechuan beef and Bitter chicken. Both items came with steam white rice. The beef dish was wonderful. The flavouring was just right for me. Not too salty with just the right amount of sauce. The butter chicken was okay. It had a little curry taste to it, with a more creamy sauce and a bit salty. The chicken is fried with a lot of sauce being poured on top. None of the items were spicy but they had chili sauce and pickled peppers on the side you can add in. They offer water and tea (tea bag) along with food. Seating area is comfy if you sit on the side with the bench. Music was what's playing on radio and was quietly playing. The restaurant had AC on so was nice and cool while you eat. The service was pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the area and saw the decent reviews so I had high expectations. I live in Markham which is close to Scarborough and as such, I've had some of the best Hakka in Canada. Hands down. 

This place is nicely renovated with adequate seating. The staff was quite tight lipped and slow, but I was hoping that the food would make up for it. 

Unfortunately, it didn't come through. I ordered fish with steamed rice. The food was exceptionally salty - like unnecessarily so. There was also too much sauce. 

I'm not a big fan of this place. I was trying to be healthy and maybe ordered the wrong plate. 

But I figure that if you're at a good restaurant, all dishes should be amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to eat chinese food.
The customer service is great, the food is always amazing. The only hick is that there is always a long line up most of the time, to get your food. That's the only downside. I waited 1 hour one day to get my food. 
But definitely worth it"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp on my recent visit to Sauga. Small place in a plaza surrounded by other chinese restaurants. Good friendly service, awesome food. Wanted something mild so server suggested non-chilli chilli chicken. Sounded wierd and funny but I thought let's give it a shot. Chicken pakora was good. Fried rice was good (which it normally is at all chinese restaurants) but the non-chilli chilli chicken was amazing. Kids loved it and so did I. Will definitely be coming here again on my next visit to the west end."}
{"text":"This Chinese place is amazing! I'm a huge fan of Chinese food, and this place never disappoints. I live in Michigan, and visit Canada often, and whenever I do, I make sure I eat here. 

This place combines Desi (Pakistani/Indian) and Chinese food for a fusion called Hakka Chinese. The food is always fresh and hot. Each chicken/beef/veggie dish comes with a bowl of white rice. I recommend the crispy chili chicken and Mongolian beef. Though take out is great as well, I'd recommend dining in, as nothing compares to fresh and hot food. 

We are seated quickly and efficiently usually, but waiting can take a long time if you go during lunch or dinner hours. The amount of customers is always a sign that the food is great, and Chilli Chicken House is almost always filled! 

The staff is friendly and welcoming. Though the place is small, they are very accommodating and do their best to make sure everyone is comfortable while dining. 

I high recommend this place for any fans of Chinese food. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My go to place when I need something quick and very fulfilling! The staff are very kind. The food is great!! My favorite things to order are sweet and sour fish and their manchurian fried rice!! Mmmm"}
{"text":"As good as Hakka gets. I know it's a bold statement but I am yet to be proven wrong. A little bit about me. I have lived in Calcutta, India (home of one of the largest Hakka communities) and I still go back for visits, so I really understand Hakka.

Details:

Ambience: Small joint in a strip mall, not much to write home about. Not sketchy. 

Crowd: Brown people (lol). 

Variety: Many cheap cheap cheap courses to choose from. Not that it matters to me because I always go for my staple Manchurian Chicken and Hakka Noodles. And a mountain of white rice that is included with every dish, I believe. Btw, I don't eat spicy food so I order my food mild.

Verdict? The owner is a gem of a guy. The servers are ever-smiling. I just love the vibe in this little restaurant. And the food is great."}
{"text":"I have been to most hakka spots in Scarborough . This place has GTAs best chili chicken! Hands down !"}
{"text":"I usually don't like Hakka at all and was dragged to go with my cousin. I had to say this probably was one of the best Hakka places I've ever had. Trust me I usually don't like Hakka at all."}
{"text":"Everything I have gotten here is delicious!

I recommend the Crispy Beef, Hakka Noodles and of course Chili Chicken."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 3 times and every time the experience has been the same.  We have never waited for a table since most people I see just come in for pick up orders.  The service is so great here, always attentive and any time you want to take left overs home (which is always due to the large portions), they even pack it for you.

Prices are reasonable and taste is great, not overly oily like some Hakka places. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"In my books, the best Hakka spot in Mississauga! Consistently delicious, fast and friendly service, and no word of a lie, mouthwatering, phenomenally tasty dishes. I've visited many times the last couple of years, and it's never disappointed me. Overall, a very reliable spot for Hakka food in the west end.

I've ordered the crispy ginger beef, chili chicken (dry), the butter chicken, chicken fried rice, among other dishes. They have a unique take to butter chicken so not everyone will be a fan, but I really like sweet dimension to the gravy - it's absolutely, knock-your-socks-off delicious. The crispy ginger beef and the dry chili chicken are my other favourites - the meat is very fresh, marinated to the deepest innards, with the perfect mix of spices. The flavours are so unique and they blow your mind; this chef needs a cookbook. On top of all of that, service is always very friendly - if you're doing take-out, call ahead (about 20 minutes), and the food should be ready by the time you arrive. 

If you're ever in the area (Creditview and Burnhamthorpe), this is definitely a great spot for a consistently delicious, inexpensive meal. It's also good for families, kids, and small groups. Plus, there's ample parking, as it's situated in a larger plaza. I'll be back again, and again!"}
{"text":"All I can say is... I'm addicted to this place! I tell all my co workers and friends about this awesome Hakka Chinese restaurant! The food is always fresh and DELICIOUS and the portions are huge! The owner is very friendly and the waiters offer above average service. I love the sweet garlic chicken, sweet and spicy crispy chicken, crispy beef, Pad Thai, fried rice, pakoras, and the honey garlic wings are killer! Cue drool**"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by another yelper and decided to give it a try since it is so close to the house.

First impression of the place was not the greatest. The place was hard to find and didn't stand out from the other restaurants. I suppose it gets it's customers from word of mouth. The inside was a little dark and outdated. I wouldn't bring a girl here for a first date (maybe second). Seriously thou, it could be updated and be that much better with better decor.

Menu is a little bland. Lots of choices and a few pictures, we didn't know half the things that are on there. But everything was reasonable price 7- 12 dollars range seems ideal for the type of food they serve (quick Chinese food). Bonus points for that.

The food was plentiful and wonderful and didn't dissappoint. We got the calamari and special fried rice and it stuffed my girl and myself. The flavors were good and it was seasoned perfectly, but there is room for improvement.

I would definitely come back and one of my must try are the chow mein and chilli chicken. Hopefully next time it would be better quality and I can update my rain gas I go. For now I'm neutral about this restaurant."}
{"text":"We were in Mississauga and really craving Hakka food, similar to Lin Garden and Spicy Dragon out in Scarborough.  We ordered the Manchurian noodles with chicken and shrimp and it was out of this world delicious!  The crispy beef was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of spice.  The chili calamari tasted either burnt or maybe re-fried or just a strange mix of spices; however, I'll try it again as I suspect it may have been a one-off.  We were, however, disapointed with the chili chicken.  We asked for white meat, which they kindly obliged, but the chicken wasn't seasoned or battered - just small strips that they might use for noodle or rice dishes and the sauce was extremely watery - no substance - we had to throw it away.  For that, I'd give it about 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Their Hakka style cuisine is a good change from the regular Chinese/Japanese places. They have a wide variety of dishes to choose from and have really good prices too. 

Taste: I would give their food a 3/5 as it's usually well done and has just the right amount of spice and flavour to it. Quantities are generous too. 
Ambience: I would give it a 3/5 as the place is a bit run down and isn't quite the restaurant for a nice family dinner. Take-out is recommended! 

They have well-priced lunch specials for only $7 and that includes a meat/veggie dish with rice and a spring roll. 

Overall, a nice place to pick up Hakka cuisine from, especially if you've been craving it for a while!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this spot based on all the good reviews I had been hearing. I had never tried Hakka style cuisine and was very curious about it.

First and foremost this place is very busy. I couldn't believe how many people were coming in and out at 9pm. 

We ordered Chilli chicken dry which I found to be very overpowered with ginger, the dish that disappointed me the most. The Hakka Chow Mein was really really good! We also ordered the Chilli Calamari which was good as well. The shrimp fried rice was meh.. 

The tastiest dish was the Sweet n Sour chicken. In my opinion it tasted more sweet then sour but overall it was tasty. They serve white rice as a complimentary dish. They say steamed but seems more like rice that's so stuck together that you have to literally separate it with a fork.

Service was okay nothing to rave about. Clearly people like this place as they had many customers. I didn't think the food was anything special and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Heard gr8 things about the place but the food felt just flat the service was below average."}
{"text":"I've waited so long to write this review, mostly because I don't know how to eloquently state how good this place is. Seems like just saying \"it's amazing!\" isn't quite enough. Nevertheless, its amazing! 

I moved from Mississauga to Oklahoma City a few years ago and I still think about the succulent shrimp pakora, the spicy chilli chicken, the flavorful crispy beef and really, EVERYTHING Chilli Chicken House has. Eating at CCH was pretty much a once a week staple, if not for a Sunday meal with family then at least for the lunch specials on a workday. In fact, Jeff M. and I missed it so much we got our Canadian family to pack some frozen Shrimp pakoras from CCH when they traveled to OKC. Where there's a will, there's a way!

The lunch specials are really affordable at just under $7 for a ton of food. Personal faves? The Manchurian fish or the Chili chicken. They taste great with the simple steamed rice but if you feel like even more flavor, you can upgrade to a fried rice for just about $1 extra. You really can't go wrong with any of the lunch special choices, although personal faves are the Chilli Chicken or the Manchurian Fish. If you're opting for the à la carte menu, the Crispy Beef, Shrimp Pakoras, Ginger Fish and the Manchurian fried rice are great options. All the food is packed with a ton of flavor and spice. The food here is by no means on the healthier side but you won't leave with regrets either. 

Also, the customer service is SO great. The staff are accommodating, kind and welcoming. It really does feel like you're dining at a friend's home rather than at a restaurant. 

CCH is one of those places where if someone asks me 'what would be your last meal if you had to choose', Hakka food would definitely make the top 3, with only my mother's food at the top of the list (and by 'hakka' I mean CCH's hakka food).

Seriously, if you haven't already been here, go now. Enjoy a Pakora for us sad Oklahomans :("}
{"text":"Very very friendly service. I get takeout regularly and it is always made fresh and on time never a wait. Their lunch special is great value, and the absolute best hakka food I've ever had. Great stuff."}
{"text":"The best hakka chinese restaurant in Mississauga.

What you should be getting
- Manchurian Chicken
- Hakka Chilli Fish Dry
- Crispy Ginger Beef
- Schezwan Chow Mein
- Hakka Fried Rice

As much as I love this place, the reason I am giving them only 3 stars is because of the immense difference in takeout. You should always eat in here, never ever get takeout.

It's one thing you eat in and they give you enough food. But when you order the same dish to take home, the portion is cut in half. I don't get why they have to be this stingy. It's disappointing. We go here almost every month. But every single time we have had takeout the portion that was enough to feed 4 in the restaurant becomes just enough for 2. Same price, same order. It's not cool man."}
{"text":"Great place to have your Hakka fix. For the most part the food has been pretty consistent on every occasion I've visited. Decor is lack lustre; but I'm not looking for fine dining when I come. Service is great too and better than most Hakka places. Definitely a recommend in my books."}
{"text":"Best Hakka restaurant in mississauga! Their chilli chicken is to die for, spicy and not overly breaded as some other Hakka restaurants in town. My other fav item on the menu is their heavenly Chicken pakoras..On top of their delicious food, Service is amazing, the owner is always there and is super nice!"}
{"text":"Great Hakka Chinese cuisine in Mississauga. My go to's are chili chicken dry and manchurian fried rice. The chili chicken is crisp and has a nice peppery flavour that isn't too overwhelming. The spice level is just right for me but you can ask your server to adjust the heat to your preference. 

The manchurian fried rice has a nice red tinge and they do not skimp on the chicken. It goes well with any of the meat dishes that you can order here. Keep in mind that the meat entrees do come with a big bowl of steamed rice. 

My gf loves the sweet and sour fish as it is not too sweet and large pieces of fried fish fillets are used in this dish. 

The great thing is that they have a large quantity of their main entrees available in both lunch and dinner specials, perfect for a generous serving of protein, rice and a fried spring roll. 

The service is usually great here as well as the servers are friendly and attentive, always coming around to refill your water."}
{"text":"Yummy yum yum! 

This place has some of the best hakka food in the city hands down. My husband and I ordered a feast since it is so raved about on yelp, and boy they are right! We ordered beef fried rice, sesame chicken, chilly calamari, and butter chicken. They were absolutely delicious and our waitress was very sweet on recommending some of their popular dishes. 

Ultimately there were two downsides to our trip here. First is the fact that every time somebody would come in through the door the ridiculous draft makes you keep your jacket on the whole time (yes it was the dead of winter), and the sesame chicken was extremely sweet (but if you love honey glazed things then its a whole different story). 

I can't wait to come back again and try some of their other dishes!"}
{"text":"My first hakka cuisine experience.  I tried the szechuan fish, which was a bit spicy with a slight sweetness. It was an ok dish. I was glad that I had the option to choose a smaller portion rather than their larger portion for dinner. The service is impeccable. They were always around to fill your cup with water and our orders came quickly, for a group of 12 people, that's amazing. I really wanted to like this restaurant,  as my friends rave about it often. So i'll give it another shot, as they have so many options to choose from the menu."}
{"text":"This place is freakin' delicious - very tasty hakka food. They have most of the classics (e.g. Manchurian everything), and a few dishes with their own spin. Must tries include the crispy beef, and the sweet & crispy chicken - both on the chef's special menu. Will actually be planning to make our way through the rest of the special menu occasionally.

Prices are fairly decent - a bit more than what you might pay in Toronto, but bear in mind the portions are quite generous. Wait staff very friendly - as far as hakka goes, what more could you want?

My partner and I moved to Oakville late last year, and since then this has become our favourite hakka spot within driving distance. Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"The chicken pakoras are amazing. the the crispy sweet and spicy chicken is delicious....this is a great Mississauga spot for sure"}
{"text":"Husband and I came here and ordered hot and sour soup, chili calamari (chef recommended) and crispy eggplant. The soup is average nothing special. Calamari was way too salty and overdosed with msg. The eggplant was oily and had too much batter on it. I only had a few bite and couldn't continue anymore. Me and my husband left there feeling sick...that's when the msg overdose kicked in. The service was friendly and they give you a huge bowl of rice for $1.50. Overall, see are disappointed and not planning on returning."}
{"text":"Day 1 in Canada & we turned to Yelp for an Asian fusion cuisine in/around Sheraton Gateway hotel (YYZ) & this little joint showed up with pretty decent reviews and 4 stars. Crunched on time we debated if we wanted to take the 16 min ride over. Well...our craving took charge and 20 mins later we were shelling out $50 for an Uber ride to an almost closing restaurant. Feeling a little rushed (by our own late arrival) we jumped right in and ordered our entrees & appetizers. Two vegetable rolls, 1 small Hot & Sour soup (that actually serves two), 1 House Special soup (would also work for two), Manchurian Beef & their house special namesake Chili Chicken. For drink, I tried the guava juice, which turned out to be a bottled drink & average.

Overall Ambiance is like an average Asian restaurant which probably gets busy during business hours but was not so when we were there. The thing that stood out most was that the place settings & the silverwares were spotless and shiny. I point this out because I eat at hundreds of Asian/Indian restaurants and it needs to be acknowledged when u come across one that has put in the extra effort to actually be noticeably clean. Kudos to them. I know it should be expected that all restaurants are spotless and clean, but not the reality specially for ethnic cuisines. 

Our food came out in about 10 mins. On average the portions were pretty generous compared to other places (in US, as this was our first Canadian outing). The vegetable rolls were steaming hot and pretty good...they probably would hv been tastier had we waited for them to cool down enough to handle. Both the soups were pretty flavorful and enjoyable once we added their table condiments to taste. My main entree, Manchurian beef was average, it did not taste like other traditional Manchurian beef so I couldn't decide if I was ever so slightly disappointed because of my own expectations or the actual taste. The Chili Chicken which we ordered in gravy form was pretty good...we ordered it hot and boy did that kick in after a few seconds so be warned :)...won't recommend asking for it to be hot if u plan to fly out the same day!

While entering the restaurant, I noticed a sign that said 'cash or debit card', not something I was expecting. I am hardly a cash cow, rather a plastic man.........seriously...if we were ever mugged, the muggers would feel sorry for us & leave us a penny or drive us to an ATM and probably charge for fuel as well! Anyway, I comfortably entered the place knowing I had couple debit cards from US. So here we were in another country, without a dollar (of any kind) to our name after chowing down $40 worth of deliciousness...I marched confidently to the counter to pay but didn't understand why my debit card wasn't working until I was told the Chicken House machine accepts only Canadian Debit card.....oops ...then the attendant told me there was an ATM in the plaza that could come to my rescue. As I headed out there, our return Uber was already at the door to take us back to airport Sheraton...so we tried to tip him into giving us cash but he didn't bite. Apparently Uber doesn't allow passengers to add tips, great policy..... until now! ...so I walked myself to the ATM while my wify stayed back as bail bond (not!) 

The owner/cashier Joe was actually pretty cool and told my wife to come back another day and pay which we thought was above and beyond for trusting two foreigners with obvious cash issue....So we decided to tip them well...to which he said 'that's too much tip' so we tipped them some more. Once penniless we felt like ourselves again and Ubered our way to the hotel.

3.5 stars for the food
4.5 stars for the service 
5 stars for trusting penniless foreigners

{"text":"True indo-chinese food. Really big portions and yummy spicy food . Try the chilli chicken . Great for take out"}
{"text":"My first time coming to this place. I saw the reviews, and they have lunch special and went to try it out but I was kind of disappointed with their lunch special. Maybe dinner is better?

The lunch special come with the meal and 1 spring roll or pop...

I ordered their general tao chicken special for around $9, and the price was reasonable as you can see the portion wasn't bad in my photo.
However, 
1. rice was hard and kind of a bit dry. I know western people have their rice on the harder side but the rice with my general tao chicken was HARD. Maybe it is hard because I have the lunch special?
2. under the general tao chicken was 1/3 of rice underneath. I guess some people like it, but I don't.
3. the general tao chicken tasted \"OK\", I won't say its good or even bad, it was just soso. Maybe its the sauce? I know some places they use ginger and garlic to their sauce to make general tao chicken and you can actually taste the difference. This place just probably use chili and sweet sauce, but maybe I was wrong, but I just couldn't taste anything other than a bit spicy and sweet.

The spring roll was alright. I don't think they make it themselves, and it just tasted like any other fast food places.

Maybe I will go again to try other food on their menu but I will not eat their general tao chicken again.

I gave them 1 star because hard rice, the general tao sauce was not good, and 1/3 rice under the chicken....
If no hard rice, and no putting rice under the chicken, they might get 2.5 stars"}
{"text":"Never even heard of this place. Never even tried hakka food before. So Chilli Chicken House is a new discovery of mine last week when a small group of us decided to go here. One of my friends told me that this chicken house has the best chilli chicken in Mississauga. So how could I say no?

I had no idea what to expect so I went in with an open mind. Obviously they did the ordering because I had no clue to what to even choose haha. We shared the butter chicken, chilli chicken, and sweet and sour chicken. Everything tasted delicious! The chilli chicken was really spicy for me so I could only eat a few pieces. If I could handle the heat I would've eaten more. The guys kept saying how the sweet and sour chicken tasted so sweet as if they were having dessert. It's not super sweet as if you'll get a toothache though.

Overall, food was great and I would totally eat here again."}
{"text":"This is a small family run restaurant that has friendly service and amazingly delicious food that is more than reasonably priced. I've been a loyal customer for over a year. It always seems to be busy, especially on the weekends--expect a line up for both take out and dine in! Order food at least 30-45 mins ahead of time and if you are dining in, make sure you've had a snack. I'm a huge fan of shrimp pakoras, Manchurian chicken, and crispy beef. Request your entrees to be done \"dry\" (no gravy), as the dishes are already very flavorful."}
{"text":"Amazing! Great flavors,  nice service. The food is just exceptional.  The Bombay shrimp was delicious.  The house special soup was shrimp and chicken egg drop soup with nice texture and a fresh flavor.  The okra was really good. The portions are enormous. Clean space."}

{"text":"Good food, bad service! This place looks inconspicuous from the outside, inside they are doing some pretty good things with a chinese/indian flair. Service is bad. Which downgrades this rating, but i am a spice counaseur an i think i have met my match. I ordered the traditional chili chicken an got it level 5. It was wonderfully flavored, followed by a deathly heat. I would recommend taking out from this restaurant nt to avoid service! Certainly wouldn't hesitate to recommend!"}
{"text":"Always so kind and friendly and the chili chicken is impeccable! Love the hot and sour soup. You cant get better value and quality than this!"}
{"text":"As soon as I arrived I was greeted by a server, I asked for a table and she gave me the corner table. 
I received the menu and I was trying to decided on a spicy dish, I asked the server \"what was the spiciest dish on the menu?\" She replied: chilli chicken.
I ordered the chilli chicken and as I was looking for rice dish she pulled the menu away from me, I told her that I was not done ordering yet, I'd like a fried rice as well. She replied no , that dish comes with steamed rice. I informed her that instead of the steamed rice I'll get fried rice and I don't mind paying for it as a second dish.
She left and brought me a plate and a napkin.
Food arrived. 8 minutes after. She brought the chicken, fried rice and steamed rice I reminded her that I do not need the steamed rice.
The food temperature was good, chicken tasted good but it was not as spicy as I anticipated.

Total cost: chilli chicken
                   Vegetable Fried rice

                   $23.05
Over all for a place like this, I'd  give the
 food 3 out of 5
Service 2 out of 5
Cleanliness: 4 out of 5
Ambiance: N/A only because it's a very casual place.

They also need to learn to handle their plates and cutleries properly.
Also staff need to know that it is not polite to eat in guest area while working. They should eat in the kitchen or break room away from the guest view.
The restaurant is fairly clean, washrooms are stocked and clean.

I would return but only for take out, I do like to try other things on the menu such as hot garlic chicken and some of their pakoras."}
{"text":"They have some good options, but nothing out of the ordinary. I like the chilli chicken and the manchurian fried rice."}
{"text":"Best hakka in Mississauga hands down. Good customer service and food never disappoints. Highly recommend this hidden gem."}
{"text":"We have been here three times now, mostly because it is close and the service is fast and very friendly. In terms of Hakka food we found it to be just alright. We found the crispy beef and chilli paneer to be the best things on the menu. The fried rice is just ok and I don't know why everyone raves about the chilli beef. We have tried it both dry and with gravy and both times we found nothing to rave about. 

I don't know what it is about eating here but we both always end up with headaches later that night. Too much salt or MSG?  Why have we gone here three times again? Oh yeah it's down the street.  For better Hakka food drive to Malton."}
{"text":"Close to home, great food, great flavour, great prices.
Friday nights never tasted so good :)"}
{"text":"Best indian Chinese restaurant in GTA 

Loved the bombay chicken, chilli fish gravy and the schzewan fried rice"}
{"text":"Ask anyone I know, I am a huge hakka fan. But for some reason I've never been here! We finally came here a few days ago for dinner after swimming. It was decently packed, even though it was an hour to closing on a Sunday. The waiter was very sweet and efficient. We got the Manchurian chow mein and Manchurian vegetable pakoras, both of which were absolutely delicious. My boyfriend is basically in love because he's been back there 3 times since we went last. I haven't had a chance to go back yet but I definitely will the next time we crave hakka!"}
{"text":"Some of the food here is FANTASTIC, and some seems to be a hit or miss, like the crispy beef. I will however say that the crispy eggplant was the BEST eggplant dish that I've ever had in my life or even dreamed possible!!! 
Also their fried rice and soups are great and portions very generous."}
{"text":"Very decent Hakka. Nothing fancy. I never order chicken dishes as they do not taste good. Beef and seafood are very good. Love the wings and cauliflower dish."}
{"text":"When I think of \"fast food Chinese\", the food at Chilli Chicken House comes to mind.  So weight watchers, people who don't like fried foods, &/or those who like to get their veg on, should probably stay away!  It's basically a carb-fest here.  

Almost everything on the menu, with the exception of the drinks, are either fried, slathered in gravy, or BOTH!  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but personally, this type of eating is reserved for when Aunt Flow comes to visit.  

Tip 1:  If you want to order a wider variety, order the Dinner Combo.  It's $6.75 for a good portion, with 2-3 servings, and it comes with rice.  You can pay extra for fried rice/noodles.

Tip 2:  If you're sensitive to MSG, ask for them to reduce it OR not use it altogether.  I grew up with MSG in my house, but I never used it myself, so I don't miss it!

Tip 3:  Menu items with pic of chillis aren't that spicy.  So if you're Indian or from a culture who can take your spice, ask for EXTRA SPICY!!!

We ordered:  Chilli Chicken (with gravy), Sweet & Sour Fish (came out bright, flame red, and was like S'nS Pork), & Manchurian Veg Pakora.  The Pakora dish was probably my least favourite.  The sauce sorta reminded me of a Chinese, black bean sauce, but a bit spicy.  The owner said that it had garlic, ginger, green chillis, and a coriander base.  It probably had soy sauce as well.  The Pakoras tasted like meatballs.

Service was polite, pleasant, and efficient.  And I'm sure that waitstaff would be more than happy to answer questions, but I really wished that there was brief descriptions for each menu item. 

Verdict:  Chilli Chicken House is definitely legit, but again, there's a time and place for consumption and it's not an everyday meal for me.  However, I won't hold my dietary concerns against them!"}
{"text":"Well, Seriously Toronto Needs an authentic Hakka place. Been to so many, in hope to settle my cravings for Hakka. But I failed again. When Mississauga just to try this place, after so many great reviews about the restaurant. But I was disappointed again. We ordered Gobhi Manchurian, Chilli fish and fried rice, all were so to average or worse. 

But in case you like it, then you would be happy for the price- quantity ratio. The service was good and the owner was very kind."}
{"text":"Great food 
Excellent service
Yet very simple 
I love these joints
Try the pad Thai chicken pakora and crispy beef 
Although their hakka food is better than their Indian food"}
{"text":"Small cozy casual place to eat Hakka food. 
Great food, great friendly service.
I recommend the crispy beef. So good!"}
{"text":"Just ordered to try a new Hakka place in Mississauga, Ming and eddies were my frequent stops. I read the other reviews on yelp and online. We ordered chilli chicken, crispy beef, manchurian noodles and a couple spring rolls. I had to call them when I got home...why u ask? To tell them the food was awesome!! Great portions and fresh ingredients! My new Hakka spot for sure!! The staff was really nice when ordering too."}
{"text":"Solid food.  Fast service. Casual decor. Good prices. The pepper fish was delicious. 
The Manchurian chow mien was disappointing. 

Would I come here again for Hakka food? Yes! 

Would I recommend to a friend? Probably"}
{"text":"Been ordering from there for years now and it's still my favourite restaurant. Everything is super delicious! Great customer service too."}
{"text":"Great chili chicken!  Reasonable price.  Our whole family liked it tho' we found the food a bit greasy."}
{"text":"We usually get pick up here but they have several tables to sit down and enjoy your food. Favorite dish is the Crispy Beef, very tasty - willing to admit I reheated it for breakfast the next day and it was still delicious. The beef is actually crispy and covered (not smothered) in sauce. Also tried the chilli chicken which packed some heat but wasn't as flavorful as the beef. Each of the meat dishes comes with a steamed rice as a side. Their noodle dishes are also a solid choice.

The prices are modest, not too cheap but you get a good sized portion of food. Service is not the best, the workers almost look unhappy to be there."}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and thought what the heck. Give this place another chance. Boy was I impressed. Chili chicken is always packed and there is always ppl waiting to be seated. They take cash or debit. They offer a 10% Discount on pick up orders. 
We got few dishes. But we were extremely impressed with the chili paneer and Chinese chopuey (shrimp only). Must try!!"}
{"text":"I just came across this place as I was craving for a hakka chinese food. However this was the worst experience I ever had and probably the very last time I would ever visit. Qualify of food was terrible and service was extremely bad. I had to wait with a small toddler was almost an 45 mins to be served with food. Would not recommend this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Great place for Hakka. I love the lunch specials. Great portion for a very good price. I've had the chilli chicken with fried rice and it tasted great. Would definitely come back again when I'm near UTM."}
{"text":"Really tasty Hakka Chinese food... we tried the Chilli chicken, crispy beef and Singapore noodles which were all delicious, but the noodles could have used more shrimp, pork, egg, etc.   But the star was the Chili Chicken of course!"}
{"text":"When I feel for Hakka, this is my main go to. Portions are generous and the wait isn't long.

I would suggest this place for anyone looking to try a new hakka spot."}
{"text":"Cheats !! Tax fraud ! Charged me tax and refused to give me the tax receipt !! Accepted only cash and did not even offer me published discount of 10%. Avoid these guys, restaurants like these should be audited by CRA."}
{"text":"Great Food!! The house special soup is definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"It's my second time here , they never seem to disappointment me . Am very much happy with the Bombay chicken ( made it more spicy ) and the famous chilli chicken too goes yumm all the time ! Not to forget the schezwan chowmein..can be made more spicy , but still it was great loving it.."}
{"text":"Average. 
A couple dollars more per dish than other hakka places. 
A mix of Thai, Indian and hakka dishes.

Some of the staff at the back were assholes though. 
One of the male workers told me the chef yelled and swore at a waitress when we kept sending her back to clarify menu items due to allergies, and the male staff kept justifying the chefs behavior when I said she was doing what I asked her to do.  I probably wont return because of the unprofessional chef.

Free green tea.

Debit and cash only."}
{"text":"Best Hakka food I've tried.  Highlights for me were the crispy beef,  Chilli Chicken and Chilli Shrimp."}
{"text":"Too much quantity, felt like garbage after cause I was super full, the things seemed unhealthy, the beef quality was not good compared to golden palace in Saudi Arabia"}
{"text":"This place is great! My whole family loves it. All age groups, spice levels and vegetarians included.
The food is always hot and fresh and generously portioned.
Well priced and nice and local.
Service is quick and polite.

The dinner special for under $8 keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"The Hukka Style Chowmain, Chili Chicken Gravy and the Tomyum soup are my favourite dishes. Sometimes the dishes vary in taste, depending on who is cooking. However, the consistency is pretty good. If you like Hukka style food, you will love this place. They only take cash or debit. You get 10% off orders over $25.00, paid by cash."}
{"text":"Crispy beef and chilli chicken were both delicious! Portions are fair and it comes with free steamed rice. Fast, friendly service."}
{"text":"Wow... that's all I got to say.
This place has great service and great food to match. 
I brought my family here, and I honestly do not regret it. 

True hakka food, portions are really big, and the price is relatively cheap.
Favorite dish was sweet and spicy chicken... on point.

Service was the best part to be honest. The restaurant was full, but they still kept coming back if we needed water or anyhting else and were really polite. 

The only thing that I would improve was the ambience really. There was a lot of flies near the back (near the cash register, kitchen area) and I got a little spooked, but no big deal aha"}
{"text":"Delicious! We go here quite regularly, and absolutely love the food. My only complaints would be the long wait, and that on those really cold winter days, when someone opens up the front door, the entire restaurant becomes bitterly cold :( But the food is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing Hakka food! My go to, cheap and fast. The lunch specials are especially worth it"}
{"text":"Best Hakka in Mississauga. Great value, taste, and overall experience. Crispy ginger beef is amazing."}
{"text":"Went here on a rainy day and didn't feel like driving super far to eat Hakka food.  So busted out my trusty Yelp app and searched for the nearest, but also delicious, Hakka food.  

And BAM this place popped up and was super happy I tried this place out.  It received great reviews and the food was delicious!  Also, was super glad we came at the right time as it started getting busy once we got our table, so I was glad I didn't have to wait.

Will definitely be coming back and hopefully this time try their chicken pakoras!"}
{"text":"Unlike other hakka places I've been to, their veg options are FANTASTIC. Noodle and tofu heaven!! Spiced to perfection - super greasy and sticks right to your gut. It's pretty small and no fanciness for dine-in but comfortable enough - adequate space between tables. Take-out is just as good."}
{"text":"The house special soup is amazing . Fried rice and chilli chicken was ok .
Chilli calamari was good too"}
{"text":"We ordered the chilli chicken, Manchurian noodles, sweet and sour shrimp and chilli calamari, as well as the manchurian fried rice. The chilli chicken and shrimp and noodles were top notch, my favourite was the chilli chicken. The calamari was average. The rice had a deep red colour which makes me wish they didn't use so much colouring, it was honestly unappetizing to look at."}
{"text":"amazing food, lots of rice, sauce, excellent taste - wow the best ONE!  fast service as well!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the past week, and I do have to say these guys know how to make great Hakka food.  On both occasions, I went in there for a lunch take out.  Service is extremely fast, friendly, and when they say it'll take 10 mins, it means you'll get it in that time frame.  

Their Chilli Chicken is really good, and not excessively spicy.  Their Fried rice has lots of great flavour in it.  And finally, their General Tao chicken comes will a quite a bit sauce and healthy portion of ginger in there, too.

I would definitely recommend them especially for the portion sizes that you get for around $8-9 (taxes incl) for a great lunch that'll keep you going for the afternoon."}
{"text":"HALAL

Great place for Hakka food. I even got catering for 175 people from this place and everyone loved it. The food here is great. Service is good.

The only thing about this place is that it does not take credit. Even if you do catering, no credit accepted...only cash or debit. Plus, if you do catering, note that they will not give you large catering trays. They gave us all the food in the regular containers that were quite small and very difficult to transport. 

It's a very busy place on the weekends. Which goes to show that the food is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is a triple-threat: Great food, great staff, and great value. The Chilli Chicken House is definitely my go-to restaurant (dine-in and takeout) for Hakka cuisine. My favourite dishes include their dry chilli chicken, crispy beef, and butter chicken. Beyond the food, each and every one of their staff members are extremely friendly - from welcoming you, to taking your order, to ensuring that you're enjoying your meal - and everything in between. Highly, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Chili Chicken House is the perfect place for people looking to experience Hakka cuisine for the first time. Service was excellent even on peak hours. Food was really good compared to other Hakka places. You can never go wrong with their chili chicken (dry or gravied). Another surprisingly good dish is their chili fish. Only negative is that the place is really small."}
{"text":"Well, after seeing so many good reviews, we had to try this place!  However, we were disappointed to see that most things were deep fried but I gather that Hakka Indian food has evolved to be that way.  When we (usually go with my wife or kids) we will try something non-deep fried, which my daughter did.  Her dish was the only one not deep fried.  It was curry chicken and was pretty good.  The option of adding veggies on the dish for just a $1 was good.

Now to talk about the service and the owners & staff.  They were definitely a very friendly, warm and courteous group of people there.  We were very happy with this and will definitely come back just for that reason.  Will look hard for the non-deep fried options and also ask for non-gravy options too.

It is so pleasant to come to a place with such a friendly vibe."}
{"text":"pros:
Friendly Staff: always out to make sure your order matches what you want
Chili chk is great if you like spicy.
Sesame chk is great if you like sweet
Lunch combo by far the best value in the area

cons:
Seating can be an issue
Time it takes for food to be ready is slower than i'd prefer but they make up for it with how it tastes."}
{"text":"The idea of the place is odd, but I find it surprising hakka is a thing around here.
I tried their sesame chicken and their shrimp and veggies. The crispiness on the sesame chicken makes me want to get more of them!"}
{"text":"Came here last night for a valentines quickie dinner!
Umm yes!!
The food was bomb!
The place was busy! 
The service was great!
PRICES ARE SO REASONABLE FOR THE PORTIONS!
Very casual, not many tables! Great for takeout!
They are very well known in the area the server was shocked that we had never eaten here before!
YES!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was average. I was told that food here was really good and people raved about the chicken dishes here so I thought to give this a try. Staff were warm and welcoming but we felt rushed because waitress kept asking if we were ready to order - when we just sat down a minute ago. They were very prompt with filling your cup with water (you'll get really thirsty from eating all the meats). We came at 8pm on a weekday and it wasn't too busy. This restaurant accepts cash and debit only and 10% off for cash pick up. 

I would come back to try other chicken flavours! I would recommend to get the crispy beef. Also, I believe you get a bowl of plain white rice if you order a meat dish."}
{"text":"I had the sweet and sour chicken with plain rice today. It was so good. No complaints at all and the service was really good at the counter. Very friendly people. I had ordered it for take out and I wasn't disappointed at all. I will def come back again!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the fuzz about? I tried to choose zero but I couldn't . So I went with one star

If you love Indian food you are going to be disappointed the butter chicken tastes nothing like butter chicken 

The Manchurian beef was too salty it could give you a heart attack. Plus they will tell you it's chilli. The realty it's not even 1/10 chilli

Very disappointing experience plus our bill was 25 for two meals, one of them only had rice, no drinks. Also over priced"}
{"text":"The food here is tasty... my favorite is the crispy beef very yummy. The staff has been consistently polite  and well serving and the food is constantly good, no surprises... yet ;) The prices are average but they do offer special combos, it is very popular.  But I always manage to get a seat"}
{"text":"This is the best Hakka restaurant I have even been in GTA.  I was craving for hakka chow mien and found this based on good review on Yelp.  And I was not disappointed:)  All of the chicken dishes were deep friend first then put in different sauces. For their signature chilli chicken dish, you can also choose the spicy level from mild, medium and spicy. As other reviews mentioned, the chilli chicken was okay, even the meat was tender but it was more on the average side.  

The hakka chow mien was yummy!! It is something you MUST order if you go there. The noodles texture were different compare to the chinese (cantonese) chow mien.  I also saw another table ordered the thin rice noodle dishes which I want to try next time."}
{"text":"Walked in to a lovely energy and welcome.  A mix of Asian and Indian done in style.  Employees remain a helpful and friendly throughout out stay while making sure we are satisfied with our food.  I'm very happy with the food because of the serving size, variety and love that I feel eating it.  Either way I like this place a lot  and took the takeout for the next day too."}
{"text":"Chili chicken, paneer chili and veg manchurian are all exceptional. Best Indian Chinese outside of India."}
{"text":"Delicious.  Whenever I am the GTA, I have to get my fix of Hakka Chinese food, and Chili Chicken House is among the best.  Very easy to miss it in the mostly asian business strip mall where it is located, so keep an eagle eye peeled.  

I ordered carry out.  I had the small House Special Soup, which was a spicy egg drop with crab, shrimp and mushroom.  A very large portion for 3.95.  My entree was the Dry Chili Okra, which was well spiced and generous in size, especially for 9.95.  Along with this came an order of white rice.  This place is probably 5 star material, and I plan on coming back before I leave GTA so I can try some other things.  

One beef:  No credit cards, debit card and cash only.  I went to pay with my debit card, and the cashier said:  No USA based debit cards either.  Americans plan ahead.  Bring cash."}
{"text":"Had take-out from here a few times, and always been very satisfied with the food quality and serving sizes. 
As there are some members of my family that don't eat much spice, it is very important to clearly specify how hot that you would like each dish - to properly balance taste and flavor. 
I have only eaten at the restaurant once, and was very happy with the quick service and light ambience. Great for conversations with delicious food. The restaurant does get crowded over peak times, so you have to be lucky enough to get a table right away. That's why I prefer their take-out option. 
They give you sticky white rice if you order either a certain amount or certain dishes, and their appetizers and entrees are delicious. Great Indian style Hakka Chinese food,  usually end up picking up from there once or twice a month now."}
{"text":"We are from Etobicoke but goes to Mississauga for bubbletea next door from chili chicken. Randomly one day took takeout then came back tonight for dinner.

Two dishes w tax was 22$. It is super cheap. Definitely not 2 $$ but more like 1 $ for price. 

We got the general tao chicken and hakka chow mein. Best general tao chicken my husband has ever had. The chow mein w chicken and shrimp was good too. (The gravy beef dish we got last time wasnt good. I like their dry dishes way better!)

Pleasantly surprised how good the food was and it was so cheap. Last night we ate at an Italian restaurant called Cellar Door and it was 80$ for half the food. 

We had to take home a doggie bag because the portion was ridiculous.

I guess I am used to the shitty service and dirty washrooms of downtown chinese restaurant...so I was super surprised when the service here was really good and the washroom was clean. They spoke English perfectly too. (Not trying to be racist here...I am Asian...but there are a lot of good authentic asian restaurants where the waiters do not speak English very well).

Overall. Definitely would go back. Awesome food. Good service. Clean restaurant. Now when we crave hakka chinese food we dont have to drive all the way to scarborough!"}
{"text":"Food was AMAZING; the service was ok.

House special soup and the crispy beef were REALLY good. Singapore rice noodle was good too."}
{"text":"People here are super friendly and very efficient too!  Their food is very tasty and their lunch specials are great!  The range of their lunch menu is around $8.  

I do find that most of their food is breaded and I mostly ask for it not to be as that is also an option.  Their butter chicken is breaded and I'm used to non-breaded butter chicken, however it is quite tasty.  I would rate it a 4 in terms of tastiness.  The curry is not the yellow kind though.  It's more of the orangey type but still quite tasty.  You can also ask for extra spicy if you like. 

It is not a big restaurant and does get quite busy as it is a very popular Hakka Indian go to place in that area.  Lots of parking, so no worries about that.  

We do keep coming back here.  They are able to accommodate quick meal service if you are in a rush.  Definitely recommend a try here for their tasty Hakka food."}
{"text":"For sometime I was contemplating to go here. Got some mixed reviews but wanted to check. Went for the lunch specials. Honestly I would rather give 2.5. But since I had to choose from 3 or 2 it is more tilted towards a 3. The shop is small no frill. Staff is friendly. The food seriously couldhave been much much better. We orfered chilli chicken gravy, manchurian chicken and scezuqn fish. The chicken dishes were identical with the gravy lackin taste to say the least. Fish was basa, atadbit better than the chicken. The chicken also tasted little under cooked. The spring rolls were very greasy. Overall the quality was not great at all. I am not coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised today that the food was very good! The pad thai, spring rolls and the dry chili chicken was so tasty! Also, they have really big portions so be prepared to take some home lol"}
{"text":"Have to say the service here is fantastic,even though they are very busy, they still serve you like a first class, will come back next time."}
