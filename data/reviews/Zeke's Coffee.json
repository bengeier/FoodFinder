{"text":"Quality espresso drinks, super smiley barista, and cool environment. Zeke's is on my rotation of weekend coffee shops!   I always get their lattes and cappuccinos and they're on par with Commonplace, for example. (can't speak for their other coffee.) And slightly better price! Service is normal too, usually two people working on the drinks (more baking behind them). The new place is designed well, which is appreciated since environment is half the reason some of us go out for coffee! It's nice how community-oriented Zeke's is, too."}
{"text":"Love the coffee! Service is always spot on! They use high quality chocolate in the mochas, which is very import to me. And there are always lots of pennies to use in the chocolate-covered-espresso-bean machine!"}
{"text":"I love this place! If only because they seem to have acknowledged progress and accept Apple Pay!  I love the coffee and how this place seems to have become an organic community meeting place where everyone is friendly.  Kudos to the owners/staff! Urban business done right!"}
{"text":"Beautiful mocha at a fair price and a lovely sitting space. There's Food trucks around at lunch time, particularly on Wed. and I heard that Tues they do \"local goodies.\""}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! The coffee is great and the people there are super nice and friendly. This is my favorite coffee place in Pittsburgh (oh and there is wifi now)"}
{"text":"Beautiful new space, great selection of baked goods, super nice staff.   I just wish their coffee was better. Have given them several chances over the last few months, and am always disappointed by their iced coffee game."}
{"text":"Never had a bad brew from this place. It stands apart from a coffee SHOP, being a true coffee HOUSE that not only makes delicious coffee (among other things) and takes pride in crafting an art. Forget your Starbucks. This is real coffee."}
{"text":"Good selection and quality. Nice staff. Outdoor seating exists but (despite a sign stating the tables are for patrons only) it is sometimes occupied by non-customers."}
{"text":"This is a review of the coffee, because we by it pounds at a time. They have many fresh, well-sourced options.  They roast on Tuesday and we receive our order Tuesday or Wednesday.   People often comment how rich and fresh it tastes.  The customer service has been superb.  I recently found out about their baked goods offerings, which is going to be a problem for my diet.   Very solid business and I recommend them highly."}
{"text":"Not only delicious coffee, but a helpful and knowledgeable staff happy to answer your questions about the difference between (and history of) Americano, Lattes, etc."}
{"text":"Mainly, I think they're a coffee roaster, but I thought I'd check them out after I passed them on my way to work yesterday. There isn't much of that espresso bar culture at this place, especially since they don't really seem to be doing espresso. But the iced coffee I picked up was light and floral, a great roast at a great price.  Definitely stop by this new place in the East End. Oh and the music choice was top notch."}
{"text":"maybe it's my fault. i see a sign that says \"coffee\" and there are some chairs and tables inside and a \"free wifi\" sticker in the window and i think: \"here's a place i can sit and get some work done on my laptop while i sip my warm beverage.\"  no bathroom. no outlets. uncomfortable folding chairs. talk radio blaring.   mixed messages."}
{"text":"The iced London Fog with a hint of vanilla is what really pushed Zeke's over the 4-stars. There is an ample amount of coffee and tea to pick from, and the baristas are willing to make you any drink you may be feeling. The atmosphere is also quite pleasant and it provides a great workspace. The vegan carrot cake is delicious and moist, and the vegan lemon raspberry scone is quite good as well. Overall just a wonderful spot with good drinks and pastries!"}
{"text":"Great service at a trendy small shop in the area. Great cold brew and variety of breakfast foods and coffee!  Definitely worth the stop if you're in the area. Prices are very reasonable & quiet if you want to sit and use the WiFi"}
{"text":"They get the job done. Not a ton of seating, and not a ton of drink options, but my visits have consisted of nice people, who are quick, and wake you UP!"}
{"text":"It's a little tight but the staff is friendly and quick. I'd love to see them update the seating though. That said don't let that stop you from getting a great cup of coffee."}
{"text":"First stop in after hearing all the hype, and I must say the hype was true! Drip coffee was suggested and I chose the Italian dark roast. Wonderful flavor, uniquely smooth, and great overall mouth appeal. No bitterness at all which almost surprised me, but pleased me immensely! I tried a Pecan bar and was glad I did, old school flavor with scratch made baked daily heavenly taste!!! Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"Love zeke's every trip to Pittsburgh...delicious small batch roasts...homemade goodies...friendly relaxed atmosphere...transitional up and coming neighborhood"}
{"text":"Hands down the best coffee I've ever had in Pittsburgh. Everything about this place is fabulous.  The coffee is super rich and strong, but goes down so smoothly. Zeke's also has good options for pastries and other food!   Zeke's staff is great as well. Not only are they super friendly but also very accommodating. I wanted to purchase a bag of their coffee but I didn't own a coffee grinder at home so the cashier eagerly grinded it for me. Woohoo!  This is also a fantastic place to study or get work done. Since there's usually not a ton of people in the shop, there's plenty of seating plus wifi and outlets. Please, just do yourself a favor and get your caffeine fix at Zeke's!"}
{"text":"Don't let the 4 Star rating fool you, this place is really incredible!   Zeke's has a wide selection of coffee options that cater to the dietary needs of many. The baristas are super friendly and were really knowledgeable about the coffee and what they are known for. I've visited a couple of times for coffee and once to meet a friend for planning purposes. Each time I've visited for a quick coffee stop, I was in and out relatively quickly. The place is usually pretty crowded with people reading,   working, or chatting, but the line to order is never terribly long. The time I met a friend to plan events, we had a difficult time finding seating. Due to the small space, seating is limited and not always convenient (hence the one-star ding). This can be tough when you are counting on a spot to gather and it is not available. In the warmer months, there are picnic tables outside to use, so the space does expand.  The barista suggested the mocha this last time I was in. It is made with a vegan dark chocolate and is absolutely SUPERB. It was everything you would want in a savory but not too sweet hot chocolate that doubles as a coffee. The chocolate was not overpowering but just enough to make it delicious. I see why they are so well-known for it. Can't wait to go back for another!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Thursday morning around 10:45am, really wanting to get a spot to do some work and also grab a bite of the famous zucchini bread. But sadly I wasn't able to get a good seat nor get to try the zucchini bread ): about 10 min later I got a nice seat by the wall with an outlet so that worked out. Seating with outlets are limited!! But I would definitely recommend coming in early for that zucchini bread because the barista told me I was literally 2 min late from the last piece of zucchini bread!! Other than that, Zeke's is a really nice place to study or get work done. It can be a bit dim I would say but when the light shines through the big glass windows of the front of the store, it's a really nice space.   The baristas were friendly and prompt in getting my order in. I actually know the maker of all the pastries and baked goods of the cafe - jihye! she said the pear bread is a new addition to the menu and it's sooo yummy, so go try it out!! I heard the scones are amazing as well so I'd have to go back to try~  P.s. Zeke's has special, cool events every month so be on the lookout for those!! Sometimes they'll have free samples of coffee or their pastries. And they'll have fun activities and just a good time to hangout in their space:)"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Let me say it once more...LOVE this place. Zeke's coffee is located at the crossroads of two different community dynamics. I usually go here to get some work done. I'll bring my laptop, earbuds, and dive into productivity! They have great, reliable wifi (it's the Green Light one). The tables along the wall have outlets with USB ports. I have yet to try a baked good (though I hear good things!), but the coffee is good. What's nice too is that this shop is on a major bus route so multiple buses are passing by at all times (71C, 82, 71B, etc), and the East Busway is a short walk away. Outdoor seating is available in the warmer months! Please give this place a try; I'm certain you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Zeke's is great. The barista is really friendly and there's lots of space to work. I've only tried their cold brew, so I can't say much about the coffee, but the cup I had was pretty smooth although a little weak for my taste. I liked the lighting inside and the friendly vibe."}
{"text":"I was perusing Yelp and noticed zekes coffee pop up a few times. I looked at some of the reviews and thought \"hmmmm I definitely need to try this coffee shop. The reviews are amazing!\"   Well, Zekes did not disappoint. The atmosphere was hipster and welcoming. I liked looking at the art while I waited in line. I ordered a vanilla Carmel macchiato and a blue berry coffee cake. My coffee was delicious! I wish I would have gotten a large, but I always play it safe on the first visit. The coffee cake was also very tasty.   Zekes = Solid 5/5 stars. I highly recommend checking out zekes especially if you're a coffee lover."}
{"text":"I love Zeke's coffee! I try my best to buy locally roasted coffee, and I was thrilled to discover Zeke's. They are very accommodating and have roasted beans especially for me. If you like fresh beans, a trip to Zeke's would definitely be worth your time."}
{"text":"Zekes is a great local coffee shop! They are loving and welcoming to every walks of life ( as everyone should be). Great selection of vegan and non vegan drinks and food. The lavender Mocha latte is Life!! The baristas are always so friendly and will explain everything to you.  The decor makes me smile just as much as the coffee."}
{"text":"Cappuccino perfection. I live in the Carrick, but drive here just for college sometimes."}
{"text":"I wandered into Zeke's while waiting to my car to get serviced at a nearby shop. I was delighted to find that the coffee was delicious, the baked goods still warm from the oven, and the staff both relaxed an friendly.  The storefront is tucked a little bit back from the street which allows for some nice outdoor seating in the summer. Inside has a small seating area, but no space problems on a weekday midday. Coffee is ground to order. I admit I am by no means a coffee expert, but my americano was really flavorful and fresh. The blueberry muffin was fresh, great blueberry flavor, and pleasantly less cakey/more yeasty than the usual stuff. For me, that makes for a more satisfying breakfast and less dessert-like pastry.   I thought the staff were great even when it got busy. Internet was fast enough for me to load videos for one of those online training modules everyone loves to do for job requirements. Would definitely recommend checking out Zeke's!"}
{"text":"Went to Zeke's this morning on the strong recommendation of a friend. Impressed by the very good coffee, and by the friendly and sincere atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm more of a tea drinker most of the time, but I've stopped at Zeke's a few times...the Samatra, Steel City Blend, Three Rivers Roast, and French Roast were all top notch.  I prefer good, strong, black coffee--and Zeke's gets it right.  Furthermore, their staff is super helpful when I have no clue what to order.  Also, they have Leona's ice cream sandwiches...yes, please!  I recently went to a meeting catered by Zeke's, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I just can't get enough of this place. Have gone a few times now during the week and on the weekend. Great place to have a work meeting, and it feels good to support a local small business.   The coffee shop is right on Penn Ave and in the heart of East Liberty. As soon as you walk in, you smell their delicious dark roast coffee. I love the smell of it. Totally wish I could pack the scent up in a candle and take it home with me.   When I approached the counter to order my coffee, on the countertop were a bunch of delicious and savory eats. I chose to get a green bean casserole puff pastry and an apple cider donut with a small coffee. I was on the fence about ordering the green bean casserole, but my friend that I was with convinced me that it was worth a try. Of course I didn't regret it. Yummmy!!! If the thing wasn't already 5 dollars, I would have gotten another one.  It was delicious, but it was definitely not enough for a meal. The apple cider donut also didn't disappoint. It was moist, sweet, and definitely tasted of apple cider. I would recommend it, emphatically!   All in all, great experience. Staff is attentive and it's clean.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"A great hidden germ in East Liberty. Best coffee and it's a small place but it's awesome. Support small coffee shops. No wifi but that's ok enjoy the wonderful view out side. But still come for great coffee place that's better starbucks."}
{"text":"So awesome. Chill people, great coffee, good banter.  This place attracts interesting characters, so if you're around for a bit, you're guaranteed to have an interesting interaction. But if you'd rather chill and keep to yourself/laptop ninja it, that's totally easy to do here.  This location has outdoor seating, too (though I'm not sure how long into the winter that lasts).  The only drawback here is the neighborhood - if you're not an \"East Liberty Type\" (as I'm not), you may be put off by all the traffic and entitled Google employees.  If you're not, more power to ya."}
{"text":"Best cup of coffee in Pittsburgh, and the baristas are super nice. Love it here."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee shop located in East Liberty. Had to admit, I was a bit surprised that I hadn't heard of this joint before, but man was I impressed. Great coffee along with bakery pastries, very reasonable prices. Ended up getting the Macchiato along with the Banananutella Muffin as my carb accompaniment. The Macchiato was delicious ... and not only that, but I could also taste/smell the hint of coffee bean which I really came to appreciate the more I finished off my drink. Not going to lie, but it's pretty rare that most coffee drinks from coffee shops these days have such strong coffee flavor. It was a huge plus for me. As for the Banananutella muffin? ... Delicious. Ingenious combination of banana and nutella. Who would have known that such a combination would taste so darn good in a muffin? The place is also a great place to get work done. Has both indoor and outdoor seating and free Wifi, not to mention plugs at every table in the indoor space. I will definitely be making a return visit to this place"}
{"text":"I'm constantly on the lookout for a good cup of coffee.  I was meeting someone and suggested Zeke's since the location was convenient for both of us.    Since it was warm/non-raining outside, there were about 3 tables with chairs outside.  However, they were commandeered by non-customers.  I've noticed that the Bloomfield Crazy Mocha has the same problem and it's too bad, because it would have been nice to sit outside, but no big deal.  Inside, there was one small table, a long counter w/ stools along one side of the storefront, and a second counter across.  Zeke's roasts their own coffee but - oopsie - someone left the beans in the roaster a tad too long because it smelled like burnt coffee inside.  They also grind their own coffee, so between the music and the grinders, it could get a little loud for conversation.  I arrived about 3 p.m. and they had a lone muffin in terms of something to eat.  But I'm imagining they focus more on coffee and limit their food options to muffin/cookies.  Service was friendly.  I got a large cup of coffee with a splash of half and half for two bucks.  The coffee was incredibly good:  very full bodied but not bitter.  The person that was sitting at the table left shortly after I got there so we were able to sit at a table rather than stools/counter which a shortie like me can find uncomfortable.  My friend had an iced tea which she said was good.  I'm sure they also make things like espresso, lattes, and cappuchinos, but am not sure they would make things with lots of syrup, whipped cream, etc.  Seemed like kind of a nuts and bolts kind of place, and I mean this in a positive way.  The coffee gets five stars, the atmosphere 3.5 stars.  Note to Zeke's:  if you want to offer your customers outdoor seating, try to find a way to shoo away locals who sit there and don't order anything."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been on the hunt.. for the best cold brew in Pittsburgh.. and we found it here at Zeke's.  I can't believe I only gave Zeke's 4 stars in my last review. They are incredibly deserving of the full 5 stars- they have the total package.   First of all, thank you Zeke's for being located in East Liberty. I think it's wonderful when businesses choose to put their business in a neighborhood that could really benefit from having it there. Everyone wants to have a store in Lawrenceville, South side, Shadyside, etc... but it takes a really awesome business to go into a neighborhood that isn't the most sought out, in order to bring more people to it. I appreciate that. They serve TONS of local treats, from the Gluten Free Goat Bakery, as well as plenty of others. It's awesome that Zeke's has options for vegans and non-vegans alike. They have an awesome outdoor seating area, and the inside is adorable as well. Their coffee is just simply the best. We have taken home their whole bean coffee and made cold brew with it at home, and have been there as often as possible to purchase their delicious cold brew. Their cold brew is strong, dark, and worth every penny. Cold brew can be a hit or miss I have discovered- some places literally give you 50% water, 20% ice and 20% cold brew & 10% empty space. Not at Zeke's. I have even ordered the cold brew without ice before, so we could take it to work the next day, and they don't even mind- which a lot of other coffee shops will not do. I cannot say enough about this place. The service is ALWAYS spectacular, their coffee is great, they are an awesome shop and I am proud to support them. After trying the cold brew in so many other coffee shops lately and realizing that Zeke's is the best, I felt the need to call the manager myself this morning to tell them how wonderful their cold brew is. I'm glad I did, but she informed me that they are going to start selling it in more places around the Burgh! They currently even have it available at the farmer's market downtown, which I did not know!  If you are a coffee lover, you will love Zeke's. It's just the best in the Burgh."}
{"text":"If you need a caffeine jolt and coffee/espresso is the answer, then THIS is THE SPOT! Our mocha latte and latte were \"amazing\" with \"expression\". When you're in the neighborhood, you really should stop."}
{"text":"Sweet spot for a nice coffee and a treat. Staff are super friendly and the mocha is delicious. Our 1year old enjoyed the goodies"}
{"text":"Zeke's is good.  The coffee selection is nice, the location is nice, and the espresso is good.  This place is relatively quiet and has a ton of seating."}
{"text":"Love their baked goods and coffee :) yes espresso coffees are slightly more expensive than other major coffee shops, but if you are coffee lover, every dollar you spend here will worth it."}
{"text":"Daaaaang. Some of the best coffee can be found here, as well as pretty fun drinks and awesome pastries! Apple cider donuts dipped in awesome Zeke's coffee = magic. Atmosphere is pretty relaxed/hipster, and they have interesting art and advertisements to look at while you're there."}
{"text":"I've been to this new location now 3 times, and it is simultaneously an intimate, quiet spot for a cup of excellent coffee or to get a paper done, and also a great place to people watch or have a conversation with a neighbor if you seat yourself outdoors. Zeke's offers excellent coffee and tea, at a reasonable price, in a fun location with a great vibe. I've been a long time fan of Zeke's coffee, ever since discovering their excellent roasts at the Baltimore Farmer's Market. On a recent visit we tried the pastries, and they were all great. Every time I come, the baristas are helpful without being solicitous, and there is always a comfortable seat available to sit for a cup or for several hours. Great location, beautiful space, and, most importantly, excellent coffee and tea."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me so long to stop and try Zeke's Coffee. I've been there a couple times now and love the coffee and the pastries. I especially love that everything is either organic or all natural and made fresh.  The pastries are delicious and a nice option to be able to grab something small to go with your coffee.  The coffee was great but my only complaint is it's not sweet enough. Maybe that's just my personal taste but I like my coffee a bit sweeter. I have to add a few packets of raw sugar and then it's just perfect.  Don't make the same mistake I did and take so long to try Zeke's.. One of the best coffee shops in Pittsburgh.  **I have to update Zeke's to 5 stars...they're coffee is really! good!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the East Liberty area, I try to stop at Zeke's. The place has a awesome vibe. It's a great place to work or just relax with a magazine and book. The staff is pretty cool and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"bomb.com. I love the coffee and the feel. Cool staff.  Simple syrup is in a Bulleit bottle. Awesome."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has some good coffee places and some good bakeries, but it doesn't have many places that successfully combine the two into an all-around great café. This is one of the things I've missed most about Boston (the land of Flour, Tatte, Crema, Thinking Cup, and more).  Zeke's is the closest I've found to that here, and it does a solid job of filling the void. They have a small but tasty selection of baked goods with interesting flavors, and the offerings change every time you go. They also make fun seasonal drink menus, and I'm a fan of the fact that they offer tea lattes beyond the basic chai latte.  If I have any complaint, it's that they don't post what baked goods they currently have anywhere, so I never know whether they're currently offering anything appealing enough to inspire me to trek all the way here."}
{"text":"Their coffee is great, even at 5 pm when usually no one brew new coffee. Both the decaf and the regular one, they were hot, fresh and great! The barista was nice and friendly, the outdoor space was great! They have great coffee (whole bean) for sale too!"}
{"text":"You must come here!! You can sit inside or outside. The coffee is amazing! It's such a cool, unique atmosphere."}
{"text":"I ordered tea latte and lemon muffins. You can choose your own tea. I like their music and enjoy the free wifi, so I spent my whole afternoon here. Love it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time in Zeke's and we only bought fresh coffee grounds. We loved the selection of coffee and the descriptions that helped to narrow our choices. We will have to make this one of our routine coffee shops and try some of their fresh pastries. We are all for supporting locally-sourced ingredients and are happy that Zeke's was able to find a new location in East Liberty."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place honestly. The coffee was good . The food was grotesque my friend said it was good and I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"Really great coffee... We we're in town for the weekend and stopped in a couple of times and service was good and Java even better.  The light roast (my preference) was smooth.  My wife's lattes were good - she preferred the caramel over the hazelnut.  Bakery items looked great but we didn't partake."}
{"text":"Zeke's has the best cup of coffee in the city; the balance of beans is always right on. In addition, the baked goods are fantastic. The savory baked good, in particular, pull me back time and again, despite my repeated reminders that I'm trying to avoid all those carbs. The cheddar/bacon and cheddar/chive biscuits are the best I've ever had. Last week I had a mushroom, bacon, cheese pastry that was so good!  Also, they have been my go-to shop for beans for a over a year now. The beans aren't burnt. Perfectly roasted for a tasty brew at home.  Beware that parking can be a hassle. But when you hit it right, it is delightful."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I always get iced lattes. I have had a couple flavors here. They are always delicious. They also have some baked goods. I've only tried the apple cider donut. It's really good. I believe gluten free. The barista's are always friendly. You can sit inside or outside. They also have a rewards card. Buy 9, 10th one free. I will definitely continue to come here!"}
{"text":"You can't compete with Zeke's. Their coffee is wonderful, service is great and they also sell Leona's Ice Cream which is made locally with ingredients from local farms. Can't get much better than that! Add caramel to your dark roast coffee. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"For a coffee newbie like me, Zeke's was a wonderful experience. The guy behind the counter was incredibly friendly and patient as I fumbled through my vanilla latte order. For $3.50, the latte itself was both beautiful and delicious, with just the right level of sweetness. When I went around noon, there was a steady but not overwhelming buzz of people around me, and everyone else seemed to be getting equally wonderful service and tasty drinks.   One of the things I really like about this place is the variety of seating options, both inside and outside. The outside is a little offset from the sidewalk and street, which is a nice touch. There's free Wi-Fi, and I can see Zeke's as being a great place to crank out some work or catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"Zeke's is East Liberty's only commercial coffee roaster. I feel pretty comfortable saying that, but please correct me if I am wrong.  First of all, the coffee is excellent. It is small batched roasted, I'm pretty sure right now he can only do 1 or 2 pounds at a time! I don't have the most discerning coffee palate, but this stuff is good... nothing like what your friend roasts in their air popper.  They have brewed coffee (I can't remember for the life of me if he does espresso) in addition to 6-8 by-the-pound offerings that were extremely freshly roasted... my pound was still warm! Averages around $13/lb.  The storefront is pretty no-nonsense bare bones, don't worry about tromping a little snow inside or bringing in your bike with you to grab your coffee.  The proprietor (I forget his name) is extremely friendly and welcomes a chat. He'll also do custom roasts for you, no minimum I'm pretty sure, especially handy if you want a half decaf blend or the like. I recommend calling ahead if you have a large order, as well.  Hours are hard to find online, but I posted a photo of what was on the door as of today."}
{"text":"I don't really get why people all LOVE this place. I had very high hopes for visiting before coming here for the very first time, and to be honest I'm a little disappointed by my experience. Yes, the coffee is good. Yes, the baristas are nice. Yes, the people seem hip and gentrified. Okay, these are all nice things but I don't quite understand how these three factors (which many other cafes in the area also possess) led to Zeke's high appraisal.  Things I didn't like about Zeke's: there is no aircon and it's HOT. I don't think this is a great place to get work done, unlike what other reviewers had said. I tried working outside on the benches for a while (it's not so stuffy outside) but because there are no power outlets on the exterior of the store I had to move back inside. It's a little dim, and the tables are a little rickety (makes it hard to type / write). They don't have glasses for water (they use paper cups) and they put my coffee in a paper cup as well, which makes my eco-mind a little sad.  So yeah. It's a decent place. I wouldn't rave about it, though. Maybe if I try the baked goods next time I may change my mind."}
{"text":"I love small local coffee shops! Don't get me wrong I still love Starbucks. I was surprised to see that they made cortados! I've only had cortados in Miami at my favorite Cuban spot. They were spot on. Wish it was closer to me so I could get my fix daily. For now I'll have to settle for the occasional trip to East Lib."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Saturday's ago for a coffee.  We had been wanting to try Zekes for quite awhile now and somehow were never able to make it there.  The outside of the shop didn't look like much with a couple of picnic tables to sit.  The inside was awesome though with dark wood floors, some couches and a number of tables.  Even though if was hot outside on the day that we visited I decided to get a large americano while my wife went with an iced coffee.  As we ordered both my wife and I looked over the myriad homemade baked goods.  The gentlemen making our coffees was rather pleasant and within a few minutes he had ours ready.  Both of our coffees were really good as they were strong and smooth and my wife commented to me a couple of times about how much she liked hers.    The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  The atmosphere was good and the coffee was as well."}
{"text":"Really welcoming and comfortable coffee shop! Good coffee and friendly service. Also, as we were leaving they were setting up some live music."}
{"text":"Love the handcrafted coffee selections and that all food is baked in house daily. The sage chicken breakfast sandwich is delicious!"}
{"text":"Zeke's Coffee... It's the best!  A while back I started noticing that my favorite local coffee shops were all using Zeke's. During a recent visit to Baltimore, I was again raving about Zeke's and discovered through the conversation that Zeke's is originally from Baltimore, which led me to do some research and they not only have additional locations in Pittsburgh, but also DC.  Now about the shop itself...I could not ask for a more enjoyable experience every time I stop in here. I'm lucky enough that this location is very close to my work, so I stop in fairly regularly either for a morning coffee or an afternoon pick me up. At either time, there's a sense of busy-ness, sometimes there's a line, but I never wait long. The staff is always extremely friendly and seems genuinely happy to work at a place like this. I don't always tip for my coffee everywhere I go, but I definitely tip here. These guys definitely make your day.  As for the coffee...delicious! The cold brew is also exceptional, as I'm not one to put cream and sugar in my coffee, so I appreciate the smoothness it provides instead of being overwhelming. One thing I've recently discovered is their iced teas. They're not your usual teas, but things like Earl Grey, which I wouldn't think to normally turn into an iced version--but do yourself a favor and try it out!  On top of the great drinks, they also have a variety of sweets and breakfast delights. They now make the breakfast stuff on premise (and I think the sweets too).  I love sitting outside of this place in nice weather on their picnic benches amongst the chill vibe.  All in all, excellent coffee at a totally reasonable price."}
{"text":"I am fueled by Zeke's.  There aren't too many craft brewing options in Pittsburgh, and I'm pretty sure Zeke's is the best.  While I haven't brought it home yet, I enjoy it every day at work.  Each blend or single-region/origin they produce has its own character.  I particularly like the Mexican Chiapas and Three Rivers Roast.  They also do tasting flights of specialty coffees.  I'm sure this sort of thing is on the rise, but they're the only place I know that does it. This flight confirms Zeke's standing as true coffee sommelier's.  $10 buys you four 6-ounce pours of particular low-yield and boutique coffee varietals that you've probably never had before, and that really allow you to get the terroir of a region, as well as back-story including, who, where, and how the coffee was grown.   Their website is mediocre, and the pastries are acceptable if you need a bite, but not special. Really, Zeke's is about the coffee and they utterly nail it."}
{"text":"We got a mocha, it was really great and huge. Much bigger than a usual \"small\". We also got a latte plain, it was ok, not the best in town."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had the most delicious vanilla latte and pecan bar (a huge one!) here. I haven't been to this location, but was pleasantly surprised by the space and vibe. Right away I loved everything about the set-up: floors, bar, display of local goodies, chalkboard, tables with flowers on them, the cushy couch, and the art hanging on the walls. Most of all, I was in love with my latte. I didn't get the young lady's name who was manning the bar, but she was fabulous! She was also part dj and her music selections were on point. I sat down and was able to decompress.  There is street parking available on both sides of the street. There isn't a parking lot specific to the coffee shop, but we were able to find a spot with ease. My latte was strong and smooth, which I definitely appreciated. The hardest part was deciding what kind of treat to try. I kept eyeing a giant chocolate covered pretzel. They have chocolate from a local place and some other amazing deliciousness displayed right in front of your face. I really want that pretzel still, which of course means I'll be back!"}
{"text":"yummy locally roasted coffee. loved the iced coffee growler over the summer.   just the basics, but tasty."}
{"text":"I went back again and had the drip coffee this time and it was amazing!  Even though it was just a standard drip coffee made in bulk that had been sitting there awhile, it tasted like the quality of a pour over or French press but for only $2!  I need to go back and find out what beans they used in it.  Definitely the best standard drip coffee I've had in Pittsburgh.  So I'm upgrading this to 5 stars.  Also they do have Wifi--another review said they didn't so maybe that was added more recently.  **I went back later and realized they actually have several varieties of drip out though they just asked me if I wanted \"light\" or \"dark when in reality there were about 5 different kinds.  They let me sample them all so I could find the one I liked last time and buy the beans for that, which was super awesome.  I would encourage them to list the coffees they have each day on a board so people know what the specific options are and the varieties they are drinking. I would also suggest they add a roasting date to their coffee beans since they are roasted locally and are clearly pretty fresh."}
{"text":"Zeke's makes the most consistently great coffee! Their child brew is delicious and their espresso is excellent. Additionally, their homemade cookies and trail mix bars are too tempting to pass up. While they often have for trucks parked outside, they don't always have savory food available."}
{"text":"Best coffee and breakfast snacks in the burgh.. Friendly to all diets and diet restrictions, and their cold brew is INCREDIBLE. Love this place."}
{"text":"I visited Zeke's Tuesday around 3pm after being caught in bad weather. The barista was super friendly and patient as I took my time deciding exactly what I wanted. I ordered a latte and their chocolate chip zucchini bread. The zucchini bread was pretty good however, I found that latte a bit too foamy. However, the smoothness of the espresso made up for it.   When I initially walked into the coffee shop, I felt as though I had transported to a totally different area of the city. It in no way felt as though I was in East Liberty. I had scored a seat in the front by the window. Looking outside, I noticed a huge juxtaposition between the demographics of Zeke's customers versus the people walking by. A hipster coffee shop next to a dollar tree is a picture perfect representation of gentrification if you ask me. Though it seems that management is aware of their delicate role in the changing community. As the only Black person in the shop during my visit, I appreciated their welcoming signs and feature of Black artwork on the walls."}
{"text":"It was a nice day out so I decided to go for a walk and stopped in Zeke's. I love how the place is decorated it reminds me of this coffee shop I used to go to in San Diego. I got a Carmel latte it was pretty good I would like to go back and try the pastrys they looked really good!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at everything we got was fresh and delicious. Interesting location, but fits the vibe well.   Ambiance: I think Zeke's vibe is a little different than most other coffee shops in Pittsburgh. Favorite thing about the place was that I felt like they were themselves and gave credit where credit was due. On menu items that had their own \"house made chocolate sauce\" or they used a certain brand of whipped cream, they put a little logo by the menu item. Greatly appreciated the extra effort to let me know where my food was coming from, especially when it's local.   Food: We got the chicken, egg, and cheese sammie that they heated up for us in a little oven. It wasn't extremely unique or something you must try but it was good and got the job done.   Coffee: Unfortunately, I didn't love their coffee options so I went for a Carmel latte and it was delicious. They also seemed to have a huge selection of teas, I didn't give any a try this trip, but will be back if I need a afternoon pick me up.   All their roasts are available in the shop and a drive thru that's down the road, if going in isn't always your style."}
{"text":"If I had it my way, the only coffee to pass my lips would be the Starbucks Frappicino of the month, which, as real coffee lovers know, is not really coffee. It's more of a...coffee-ish milk shake. For me, coffee is just a medium for sweet, delicious flavors, BUT the BF is a true-blue coffee lover, so I am a bit more knowledgeable about coffee than I normally would be.  And the coffee at Zeke's is decent coffee; not as good as CTR but MUCH better than Starbucks. We've never really had the pastries/goodies/sandwiches, so we are really no help there, but the atmosphere is pretty cool too. Kind of a Hipster-Eclectic mix. All in all, he likes Zeke's but there a two cons; 1) you can only buy the beans by the pound, which doesn't blow me out personally, and 2) they are completely inconsistent with their pricing. We can go there twice on Saturday and once on Sunday, get a refill into his own cup- the same one he uses everywhere- and get charged three different prices. This realllly rubs us the wrong way. So...I would try it, but just advise watching what you're being charged."}
{"text":"Friendly people, cool shop with local art for sale on the walls, and great coffee.  I had a small Ethiopian pour over.  Quite tasty.   They also played classical music, which is a plus for me.  It's the kind of place I wouldn't mind spending an afternoon in."}
{"text":"Extremely good coffee, and even better baked goods. I love their Caramel Latte - one of the best I have ever had (especially with almond milk!). I don't know who is making their muffins, but they are incredible. Every day there is a different, unique kind (strawberry balsamic...what?!) that is SO delicious. Service is quick and very friendly. Can get a little busy in the mornings, but overall a great local coffee shop that I enjoy going to a couple times a week."}
{"text":"I love that this place is pretty much in my neighborhood, and while it can be seen as gentrification, I always see people who have lived in this area forever frequenting the shop. That's a good sign to me for a lot of reasons, the main being that it brings together different communities.  The most exciting thing about Zeke's isn't their coffee. While the coffee is very good and often has a pretty foam heart, the service and atmosphere is where it's at. This shop is cozy and comfortable, you feel at home here. That's how a coffee shop should feel in my opinion.   Not only that, I'm infinitely amused by the massive collection of local advertisements and odds and ends. I like to come here to collect info on what's going on 'round'tahn. This is pretty common in Pittsburgh though, and always appreciated. Starbucks is very sterile in that respect.   I hope Zeke's continues to be successful as a valuable part of the East Liberty community.   This concludes my love letter to Zeke's. ;)"}
{"text":"When cold brew is an option, I always get the cold brew. So I got the cold brew and it was totally satisfactory. The barista suffered from a bad case of ImTooCoolToAnswerYourQuestions, a tragic condition that affects most 20Something hipsters that work in coffee shops. Luckily I didn't have to endure the Aubrey Plaza style glare from over the black-rimmed glasses, but my poor friend behind me did.   Despite the unenthusiastic service, the coffee is what I was really there for, so I'd still give it four stars. But there are a few better shops in the area that deserve as much hype as Zeke's gets.   Zeke, be careful. Good service is where it's at, so you might wanna step up your barista game."}
{"text":"Zeke's has such a nice atmosphere - I always enjoy a visit here. Their outdoor seating is great on a nice day. Never have been disappointed with a drink here. Definitely not the cheapest coffee you can find in the area, but worth the splurge for the consistently good drinks!"}
{"text":"I have changed my favorite since I visited here. I am sure this is the most enchanting cafe in this area. Most of all, I have a crush on its caramel latte. Adorable   You have to taste it."}
{"text":"Wonderful locally crafted goodness. Hella kind people behind the bar and top-notch everything, honestly. Neighborhood is dope and the music is always fire"}
{"text":"Love it when I have a meeting in East Liberty!  Sauntered in, and asked Danielle to fill my mug with coffee. What kind? Surprise me. She did, and it was great: Columbian Papaya, a well-balanced,  medium roast.   Can't stay here too long...those Molasses Muffins ($3) are looking way too tasty. And I'm a sucker for molasses. And the Rhubarb Almond Coffee Cake, which is a huge square ($3), is just begging me to give it a good home. Then, there's the Apple Cider donuts...  Plugged in my phone, and enjoyed a pleasant musical interlude of oldies (yes, before I was born). It's a bit toasty in here,  but the door is open, so it's getting better. Still, I'd rather sit outside, but the only picnic table is in sun, and I have no desire to bake my skin. Also, I have my Luigi's Italian Ice from Dollar Tree."}
{"text":"I must say that since I have purchased their Royal Blue coffee blend, I've become a fan of Zeke's. You can find their coffee in many stores around the city but this is the only place I know of that will grind the coffee for free. They have on stock a variety of coffees and espresso blends to sell.  In addition they sell espressos, coffee of the day and various pastries. You can even get a T shirt here if you want it. Don't have time to park? They have a drive through nearby which has shorter hours but you can at least grab your coffee and go.  The staff is both friendly and helpful and will let you sample if they have that flavor available for the day. Expect to pay a little more for your pound of coffee but the Royal Blue blend has always been one of my favorites and I use it quite frequently at  home.  Not a coffee drinker? Tea is also available and they have free WiFi. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available. If you do decide to purchase their coffee in bulk then make sure to store in in a dark airtight container in your cupboard. This will help it last longer since the normal shelf life of the beans is about 3 weeks."}
{"text":"Greeted immediately as I walked in, order a Strawberry Mojito. My drink was ready in a few seconds  I also picked up a fresh and tasty Snickerdoodle cookie."}
{"text":"Came here for some latte's and a baked good. Not a bad selection. Our lattes were awesome. I can't recall what baked good we had but it was just okay. Seating wasn't bad but I wish it felt a little more homey."}
{"text":"Ahmazing!!! Great coffee, friendly attentive service, organic options and compost able plastic containers for the Togo cold drinks. Excellent !"}
{"text":"Perfect spot to kick back and relax with a good ol' cup o' joe. I love the tranquil coffee shop ambiance mixed with the hipster flare. The free wifi and tables equipped with outlets are great for anyone looking for a peaceful space to work or study. As far as the coffee goes, I was just not feeling it. I ordered a large iced coffee ($3 +tax), and something about the flavor was just strange to me. On the plus side, they offer many different desserts and pastries to pair with your coffee that look fan-freakin'-tastic. I would be open to coming back for the muffins, but I'll take a pass on the coffee."}
{"text":"The place for coffee and tea. Hands down. Sure I enjoy the local Crazy Mocha chain and Starbucks, not gonna lie. But there's nothing like an independent coffee house with the freshest most natural coffees teas and pastries. I love it all!!"}
{"text":"Cool coffeeshop with enough seating and some good products. I enjoyed the latte. The only bad thing was some of their stuff wasns't available."}
{"text":"I always hope that a coffee shop is kind to us tea drinkers. I realize it's a coffeeshop first and foremost, but it's always great when they carry a nice selection of tea. Glad to report that Zeke's does! They carry loose leaf teas in a variety of options (I stick to english breakfast or earl gray).   They also have almond milk, which is a fab option to have. And even better, they bake in-house goods and even have small savory bites available. Their pasty selection looks beautiful and I need to dive into that one of these days. They also sell a few local favorites, like Gluten Free Goat (gluten free baked goods, dah!).   I also like that they have a decent amount of seating inside and a great patio in the front to sit and enjoy your coffee. I'd argue that perhaps the slatted tables inside aren't the most conducive to a cup of liquid, but that's a minor observation. The other cool thing is they have food trucks that visit during lunchtime hours. You can usually find their schedule of food trucks on the website or twitter. I've seen Berlin Street Foods out, which I can vouch for being a delicious choice!   Hop around the corner from Target and grab a to-go cup from their drive-thru too! You don't even have to get out of your car for a good cup of coffee (or tea in my instance!)."}
{"text":"A wide selection of excellent coffee. Staff is super helpful with making choices. I haven't been able to try the food/baked goods yet. But I'm going back soon to try!   As a yinzer, I appreciate the pittsburgh themed coffee names. They are going to make excellent Christmas gifts for my family that moved away from pittsburgh.   Definitely recommended as a relaxed place to study, people watch or curl up with a good book."}
{"text":"I love Zeke's so hard. Their blends are just so delicious (my Top 3: 1.) Allegheny Reserve 2.) Steel City Blend 3.) Hippie Blend).  But I'll review the space since you can get Zeke's at theIr drive-thru by the Target, the Bloomfield Farmers' Market, 52nd St Market in Lawrenceville, Whole Foods, Giant Eagle...the list goes on.  The spot is a really great place to hang out in though. They have electric outlets by the tables for people who want to work on their mobile devices, or a nice cozy couch area. Wifi is free and public - no password needed!  There is also a nice selection of sweet pastries and menu items made to order. On some days they carry items from other local spots like Gluten Free Goat, Relish, Pigeon Bagel, and always some of their own. They have a nice variety for all dietary restrictions too - vegan, gluten free, flourless, etc.   Just love everything about Zeke's and I love being able to support all things local when enjoying a great cup of coffee. #fueledbyzekes"}
{"text":"Zeke's staff has more ink than most Bic factories.  Their pierced faces are riddled with more holes than a box of cheerios.  They are also the friendliest, most knowledgeable, and passionately enthusiastic baristas of any cafe I've ever been to.  They know every facet of the menu, and make personalized recommendations to fit any discerning palette.   The inside is cozy, and all the drinks are the highest quality.  The premium snacks and indulgently sinful sweets are all delicious.    Most coffee shops staff and customers wouldn't have had the dedication to raise over $20K on IndieGoGo, but Zeke's community is different.  Don't be scared, come and taste the love!"}
