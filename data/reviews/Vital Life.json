{"text":"It's actually really great to find vegan Caribbean food, but 3 stars for the place because it isn't that good in most categories.

The place is smelly, dirty, and small with limited seating and the bar table feels like it's going to fall off. The food is a little plastic-y (tastes flavourful enough) but I did not appreciate the price at all. How much could it possibly cost to make rice and beans? It is also extremely greasy and oily, but that's what is to be expected so it met expectations in that category.

If you're craving vegan Caribbean food and don't mind paying average to above average takeout prices, perhaps you'll be pleased with this place. But if you're looking for some quality and tend to actively evaluate if your food was worth it or not (like I do) you might be disappointed. I'm glad this place exists; would recommend trying out, but would not return."}
{"text":"What a gem. I live nearby and passed by several times before going in. I wish I went sooner. The atmosphere isn't fancy but the focus here is all on the quality of the food. I especially liked the bbq soy (some of the best faux meat I've ever had). And I need to go back for the mac n' cheese!"}
{"text":"Got here early on a Sunday morning with my family.  We didn't have many options but every item was fresh and delicious.  We had a combination of 4 items with no drink.  We were the first people there which was awesome because the restaurant is small.  The two gentlemen working there were very kind and even offered my son some plantains fresh off the stove for free...very kind and thoughtful guys!!  I wish we could have waited for the Mac and cheese....maybe next time :)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I love Caribbean food. It is a charming hole-in-the-wall spot and the folks who served me were super kind. I love little restaurants and always want to support them, and hey, maybe you will love it here! Clearly a lot of people do! But let me explain why I won't be going back. 

Price: $20 for a little drink and lunch seemed a bit ridiculous to me, especially for the quality. The helpings of food were decent but I honestly cannot finish it, nor do I think I'll be able to. I took a shower before eating here, and after trying to finish the food (but not being able to) I feel grease and oil seeping out of my pores. I took the leftovers home and was thinking I might be able to try to finish it by adding some raw greens & plain rice but honestly I need to throw it away, like $16 of food which is a huge fucking bummer because I am not a rich person and when I go out to eat I want it to count! My big criticism is the food is just so fucking OILY/GREASY!! I absolutely cannot eat it!!! If you are a junk food vegan and your main food groups/taste buds are oil/fat/salt/sugar, you may really love this place and find it to be just the comfort food that you need and want. I love decadent comfort food too, but really cannot stand stuff that is heavy on the oil/fat/grease. It makes me feel super, super sick but hey maybe you have a stomach of steel and are super into it.

It is probably the worst vegan mac I have ever had. If you're looking for a decent vegan mac and cheese, try Hogtown Vegan. For excellent light, non-oily non-greasy Caribbean vegan food go to One Love."}
{"text":"Holy heck, man. I can't walk past this place without walking in, and I can't walk in without buying a plate with everything. The mac & cheese (if you're lucky on a day when they have it!), the BBQ soy, the dang rice & peas - it's all golden. It's all literally made of delicious gold.

I found out about this place from the Vegetarian Food Fest, where they served their mac & cheese, and I've gone back several times since then.

Top any plate of mine with fried plantain, and you're in my good books."}
{"text":"This place was so good to find on my recent visit to Toronto and the Kensington Market. My other favourite Caribbean/Rasta restaurant, Imhotep in Brooklyn NY closed a few years ago and I was missing that! 

The food at Vital Life is awesome! I have four choices, mushrooms, curry, callalou and rice and beans. A great variety and very filling! I'll be back on my next visit to Toronto and the Market!"}
{"text":"These guys are vegan wizards. Incredible food and a great deal with the 4 items package. Impressive meat alternatives (bbq soya, tossed tofu). Friendly and warm for us on a cold day!"}
{"text":"A very small shop downtown. The man working there was helpful and \"no bullshit\", he didn't put on a show to impress you like a lot of restaurant owners do. It was pretty difficult to understand what food was what because it was all there with no name tags, and when he told us, he simply ran through them too quickly. A small box of food is 10$, you get a rice base, 3 toppings, and fresh vegetables on top. Then the large is 15$, same idea as the small but 5 options for toppings! It was very delicious, everything I got was very tasty and flavourful, I loved everything. The meat tasted very legitimate, they even shaped the fake shrimp like actual shrimp! It was super filling and worth every dollar. I was extremely happy with my meal. Will be coming here again. I'd recommend sharing the large with a friend, as the small is already huge on it's own."}
{"text":"A winning comfort food lunch combo: pumpkin stew, bbq tofu, rice & peas and coconut water. Ask for the smallest portion - a good price and the right amount of food. You won't be stuffed, but perfectly satisfied."}
{"text":"Straight up tasty, good quality, unpretentious food. This is a take out joint with a few seats. The man behind the counter makes loads of dishes and you can choose a small or large container or ask for a bit of everything and he will load you up for $15. My friend and I did that last time and couldn't decide what was our favourite; the callaloo, Mac & cheese, pineapple BBQ drumsticks, etc. A great place to stop for a big satisfying lunch. All vegan & tastes home made!"}
{"text":"The bright rasta colors caught my eyes as I was walking in Toronto towards Chinatown. Above a record store is a great new restaurant serving vegan and vegetarian ital food. No meat here but you don't miss it. Rice and peas made with brown rice, a flavorful curry chickpeas and potato stew and soy balls are just some of the offerings here that I liked. Run by Rastafarians this place also serves freshly made sorrel, cane juice and Irish moss. We got some samples of most of the good food and drinks sold here and everything was good. There is seating inside and also chairs and tables outside right next to the machine that extracts the lovely cane juice from sugar cane stalks. If you like vegan and vegetarian food you will like this place."}
{"text":"Damnnnnn! The food here is delicious. If you haven't noticed, I've been on a bit of an ital food bender lately. How could I not with all these awesome places opening up? There's now 2 places in the market - Vital Life and Veggie D'light, One Love at Bathurst-Bloor and V's Vegan Caribbean on the west side and Ital Vital in Scarborough.

Get all the things for $15, 4 of the things for $12 or a lot of one thing $5. We went for one all, one 4 and we'e very satisfied. 

They also had fresh young chilled coconuts which was delightful for polishing off the meal.

The vegan mac n' cheese bake was perfection and we both loved the 2 types of TVP curry, the callaloo, plantains and beans. 

Get yourself some ital food and lively up yourself!"}
{"text":"The curried chickpeas and potatoes, callaloo, and BBQ tofu are AMAZING! This place also pleased my non-vegan boyfriend who loved it all too. I ordered a large plate and it is seriously so much food(and it's great because you get to try a bit of everything they're serving that day for $18 taxes in. It is the perfect amount for 2 people to share! A small plate, which would be perfect for one person, is $8+tax I believe) I would definitely recommend if you are around Kensington Market and looking for something warm and nourishing to fill you up!"}
{"text":"Bbq soy, with the rice and peas....AMAZING. Often out of stew pumpkin and Mac n Cheese but food is always fresh and tasty. Staff is very friendly and helpful explaining all the dishes for the day."}
{"text":"Parking: Green P multi-level garage literally right beside the place. $4 Flat rate or $1.25 each half hour.

Venue: Small walk in. Only 2 tables. If the tables are taken by other people, you either do take out or stand and eat.

Washrooms: Small closet size.

Experience: It's a 'mom & pop' type of place, the food is great, but a little over-priced for what you're getting. I've been here many times, not because I'm a huge fan but because my cousin loves this place and keeps wanting to eat here."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food and juices. The barbecue seitan was some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes. Quinoa, BBQ soya, curry cauliflower, chickpeas, Lima beans, spinach, spiced mango, plantain.

For a single person, the small is still too much. The large can easily feed 2 people. 

Will definitely go back when I'm studying in the area."}
{"text":"Their food is good and the service is great, but I prefer spice food. Their food is a little bit sweet for me. If you are veganism or love eating healthy, I do recommend you to go there. :)"}
