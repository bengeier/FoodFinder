{"text":"We order take-out from this location on a weekly basis for over 6 years and have never had anything but friendly service and good food.  The fish is always fresh and well prepared.  I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"On Friday November 16th, 2012' I witnessed the Manager of the Bluenose RESTAURANT , verbally abuse a disabled man in a wheelchair and refuse to serve him because he had a working dog. His employee continuously shoved and kicked the service dog while in the doorway. York Region Police were called. The manager's statement \"neither, the Police or the Courts, can make him serve Canadian white crippled trash who eats and sleeps with dogs! Marie Fortier Shame on the Bluenose Restaurant for this illegal action!"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN Our family have been patrons at this restaurant for nearly 18 years. We know the wait staff and owner/chef by name and have mostly enjoyed good service and fairly good food.  Today, we stopped by for lunch and the restaurant was about half full.  As we settled into a booth near the front, we noticed that here were two massive poinsettia plants on the middle column.  We asked the waitress if she would mind moving the one nearest to our booth because a member of our party is allergic to poinsettia pollen, and would end up suffering an asthma attack if the plant wasn't moved.  She was happy to oblige but as she walked the plant to the back of the restaurant, the chef/owner, Nick screamed at her at the top of his lungs. At first, we thought someone was being attacked because the shouting was so loud and out of place.  We quickly realized that he was screaming at the waitress to put the plant back where it came from.  She explained that a customer had asked for the plant to be removed, to which he responded, \"I don't care!\" She tried to further explain that the customer would suffer an asthma attack if the plant wasn't removed.  Again, he replied that he didn't care.  We were shocked by his agressive, rude behaviour and were at a loss for words in the moment.  The waitress was very apologetic and clearly embarrassed by the incident.   We were so offended and shocked that we quickly and quietly left the restaurant in shocked dismay and will NEVER return."}
{"text":"My mom and I came across this place as we were going to get some water at the Shoppers Drug Mart. The atmosphere was very cozy.  The owner was very friendly and  hospitable and she gave us the menus.   The variety of food was enormous and so were the portions of food but on the plus side you don't leave this place feeling the least bit hungry. I was full by the time I left which is quite unusual for me.  But I was happy."}
{"text":"Their fish is always excellent and the staff are so warm and personable...feels like family! Their souvlaki platters are awesome...the meats are tender and flavorful. I've never had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"Get the specials or fish n chips.  Not the clams, such a small order! We are in Markham after all, seafood way better out when I visited west coast Canada."}
{"text":"Fantastic fish and chips. Good portions and not greasy... Been a regular customer for years."}
{"text":"I can't give half star ratings, but I would give Blue Nose a 3.5 stars.  I've eaten here just a handful of times (dine-in), and for the most part the food is good.  The last time I was there i was with my husband and 3 month old son (he was in his car seat).  The booth we were seated at by the window had just enough room to put the car seat in next to me.  I had the halibut and chips.  My husband had the coleslaw, chicken souvlaki on pita, and added fried clams.  My halibut was moist and crispy, but breaking it open with my fork squeezed out a noticeable amount of oil.  The fries were decent, not a favorite though.  I had to pay $0.50 for an extra tartar sauce, which comes in those tiny little plastic sauce containers.  For such a big piece of fish, the 1:1 fish-to-tartar-sauce ratio doesn't quite work out.  Seems to me they should just keep the tartar sauce in a squeeze bottle on the table for customers to help themselves - no more charging $0.50 for extra sauce, not to mention all those little containers they will save from going to the landfill.  My husband's coleslaw dressing is cream based, compared to Danny's Fish & Chips which is a vinegar dressing.  His chicken souvlaki was good, he said, but the fried clams were a disappointment.  They were the strangest looking clams we've ever seen.  They looked more like fried mealworms than clams.  Somewhere in that string of batter was a tiny piece of clam.  The dine-in service is decent there.  Our waitress (Corrina I think was her name) was friendly and efficient.  They have their crowd of regulars, based on the first name greetings heard around the dining room.  Their takeout lineup gets insanely busy at the dinner rush (we were there on a Friday night), so be prepared to stand a while.  I find the lady at the cash always to be \"efficiently indifferent\" - I've never seen her smile at her customers or greet them with a genuinely warm \"hello\".  Just place your order, give her your money, and move aside.  I'm sure she's friendly with her regulars, but I'm not one of them.  Overall, Blue Nose is ok.  I would go back only because I live so close by, and with an infant, close proximity is important."}
{"text":"Agree with most other posters about the cook at this place.  Guessing his name is Nick and the owner from the other reviews.  He is rude and could care less about customer service.  Hours or operation are not that great as well.  Closed on Sundays and at 8 all other days.  Food is good but not good enough for me to want to come back.  However the old waitress is always friendly and works really hard. I give it a 1 star just for her."}
{"text":"This place makes an outstanding fish and chips , our family has been going there since they open.  The people are very friendly and they are familiar with there regular customers.  As far as the dog situation goes,  I truely don't believe the owners or management would treat someone like that, they have heart.  KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service and the food was utter garbage. I made the unfortunate mistake of trying this place without consulting yelp. After doing some research, I found out that this restaurant, the owner, and staff discriminated against a disabled couple and their service dogs... I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The food is good but the owner is a complete turd and makes the food rotten. He's a fish nazi and if you don't order the way he wants you to order you may as well just march yourself into the deep fryer."}
{"text":"Plain restaurant located in busy and uninspiring strip mall on Highway 7 does not inspire much confidence based on looks alone, but the busy atmosphere proves that locals know a great bargain when they see one!  The fish and chips are excellent, generously sized portions, fried to perfection, and try the coleslaw with it - delicious!  Cheery, quick service, Greek salad is also very good."}
{"text":"Pricier than Vinnie's Fish & Chips in Vaughan.    The waitress was friendly and witty.    It could have been a pleasant fish and chips with coleslaw lunch.  But, the balding man in his 40's cooking my lunch was mouthy and rude towards his staff.  Because of him, I will not return."}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer here but not anymore. I went to grab a lunch salad with fish (total $18 and change) to go. When I came home and opened the bag it was a tiny little side salad. So I thought there was a mistake and called the restaurant to see in case I might have gotten someone else's food. The owner Nick picked up the phone and let me tell you, he is one awful human being. I asked him if the $18 salad was supposed to be a side salad and he went into a ramble of him being there for 25 years and if they deceived me and asked if they stole my money or what the problem was. I tried to explain that I was kinda hoping for a salad to be a meal size and not a \"sampler\" size. He continued to be rude and obnoxious and when I told him his attitude was inappropriate he hung up.   This place used to be so good but ever since the other place opened across the street people have been leaving them left right and centre. The quality of food has gone down the drain (the owner should go the same way)... too bad!!   As for the quality of the meal. The fish was well seasoned (grilled) the salad was fresh, not a lot of dressing (only the few pieces at the top had dressing on it)   But apparently that is his way of dealing with customers, lots of articles about how he denied a paraplegic from bringing his service dog with him to eat.. Nick you piece is shit!"}
{"text":"Another example of an overpriced, small portioned fish and chips joint. My advice, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Adding a star,  as both the food and the quality of service has improved.  Food is fresh and hot.  customer service is improving since their earlier gaffes.    Get there early for dinner as it gets busy as it gets closer to closing.   They charge extra for small packets of tarter or garlic sauce which is a detractor.  Their onto  rings are good. Not too greasy.    Their Greek salad dressing is a bit sweet,  but otherwise the salad is fine.   Fish is firm flacky and flavorful."}
{"text":"FAVOURITE family resto in Markham. Authentic, fresh & the best fish and chips within the area. Family owned- this resto has the best service. I've been coming here for years with my family and the owners always remember us and sitting inside you'll realize they remember all their customers new and old. They also have the BEST home made Greek salad dressing that my entire family is obsessed with. The servings are quite large & the fish is always cooked to perfection. Fries are also very crispy & house cut fresh. Absolutely recommend trying their Greek food, the best in Markham. The Greek food plates Are also quite large, enough to share.  Service is always consistent take out or dine in. DEFINITELY worth the try! I have yet to be disappointed here with food or service"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite around 6pm.and overall it was good. The place is fairly average.    Pros  -Excellent service (short haired blond lady was the only waitress and even though she was the only one in the whole restaurant she was amazing!)  -Haddock tasted good -Portions are large  Cons None that I can think of"}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 10/10 -- Service: 7/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 7/10  You get a lot of food for your money, so if you want to be stuffed, this is your place. For great fish and chips, you might have to look elsewhere.  It's not terrible, but it's not great. I had the lunch special haddock and chips that at $11.99, came with two pieces of fish, fries, coleslaw, and two cans of pop. The two cans of pop is kind of weird. Is this for two people? Oh well, I ate it all myself.   It didn't look like haddock I've had anywhere else (usually smooth). It was lumpy, kind of soggy, and fell apart. The fries are very average. Both the fish and fries should've been fried a little longer. It wasn't unenjoyable, but it wasn't great. I'm not sure if this is new, but while they give you tartar sauce with your meal, there are also tartar sauce packets off to the side along with the vinegar and ketchup. If they cost extra, no one told me.   There are a lot of windows, so on a sunny day, it's a pretty nice place to eat. It's spaced out well and has a good combination of booths and two-seaters.   This is on par with the nearby Halibut House on Wooten Way, each with their own great values."}
{"text":"One of the best fish and chips in the gta.  Definitely in my top five for halibut I've ever had and their fries are to die for.  Their souvlaki and Greek salad is killer, too.  Friendly owners and great service make this one our favourite local spots."}
{"text":"Amazing fish and chips! It is crispy on the outside and moist/tender in the inside. The fish is succulent and fresh and fried to perfection. The fries portioning is larger than average and crispy. It is almost like a mom and paps restaurant. There is a waitress there that loves to joke around with us.  She usually brings a glass of water and coke for us. She will say rum and coke for the gentleman and vodka on ice for the lady. I love her sense of humour and her warm smiles. The two chefs are friendly and greets customers as they walk in. They have lovely booths against the window and larger tables to accommodate to groups too. It is a nice relaxing restaurant with different sail boats models all over.   Yummy food and great people! What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went here 1 time and wont go back ,it is horrible and should be shut down. Also found out today the woman there kicked a service dog and was horrible to a man in a wheel chair who owned her. Shut them down people!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband was recommended to come here as he was told it was a really good place to eat. Really happy that we did! The place is small but cozy. Food is really good. Happy with the portions and quality of food. Definitely recommend the fish and chips and the pork souvlaki! Our server( petite lady with blonde hair) is really nice and pleasant. Always greets you with a smile! Also, just an FYI for parents, there is a change table available for babies."}
{"text":"One of the best fish n chips and greek food I've been to ever.  The Tuesday souvlaki special is amazing!  Home cooking feeling and the staff makes you feel like you joined them for dinner.   Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Probably the best fish and chips in Markham.  They are always fresh.  The only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars is based on the fact that their customer service isn't so great and they are stingy with the tartar sauce."}
{"text":"This neighbourhood restaurant serves the best souvlaki dinner and fish and chips. Place is very busy kn the weekend. The service is impeccable. The servers make you feel at home. One of our favourite restaurants."}
{"text":"Having been here for ages, I figured it was time to finally have bluenose fish & chips and it's definitely a decent option. Without a doubt the fish and chips are good here, but the execution could have been a tad better.   We had takeout and I'm not sure if this had anything to do with the soggier than expected fish batter but it was still pretty good. I really enjoyed the haddock they have here, it's super flakey and it's fresh. Nothing beats good quality fish and they have that here at bluenose. I'd say the fish had a moderate amount  of oil without being overly oily. And I wish they would have gave more of their homemade tartar sauce. I think we asked for more tartar sauce and was given packets of them as opposed to the store made stuff.   The fries were also excellent, they were thick cut and fried to perfection. The only downside was that there were too many short crispy strands, more than a quarter of the fries were like this."}
{"text":"I have been back 3-4 times for lunch since my initial review. A couple of new things we've tried:  Pork souvlaki on a pita - good amount of meat that was tender, seasoned good, right amount of tzatziki, tomatoes & onion and the pita was fresh.  Kids menu tenders - my kids love them! Generous amount of fries with 2 medium sized tenders - $4.95! Perfect amount and the kids eat all of it.   They have great lunch specials & on Tuesday night's dinner special is buy \"Buy One Chicken or Pork Souvlaki Dinner & Get the Second One Half Price\"  Service is consistently good and they are so warm & friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent family run business. The halibut is excellent, and the food is not greasy.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went there by myself the other day 5:30 pm. I felt the seating area was very small, and the small 2 seater tables they were trying to get me to sit in were so tiny you wouldn't be able to read the paper at the same time. I took a booth but was warned they may kick me out if it got busy. I had to rush a bit to get out of there in time before that happened. Now, I had fish and chips 11 bucks plus tax. An extra piece of fish was 10 which I thought was overkill. The portion sizes were great and the quality of the potatoes and fish were great. I could tell the oil they were frying in must have been clean as a whistle. My only complaint about the food was the fish was lacking that crunchy batter texture I like. And the pop I ordered came in a can and they didn't even open it.  Either than that, not much wow factor, maybe abut pricy, but I could tell that there was some dedication to the food, service and cleanliness of the place."}
{"text":"I ate at Blue Nose today and I must say I will be coming back more often. The Halibut and chips were so good. The batter is so delicious. The chips are nice and hot. Just the way I like it. The service is great. Everyone is very nice. The place is nice, clean and cozy. I've been to Halibut House across the street and their fish and chips were horrible. The halibut was dry and the chips were cold. Wth"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Their fish and chips tastes really good, only thing i didn't like was their gravy, it was very bland. The fish frying batter was good but i prefer The Halibut's House fish fry batter more."}
{"text":"I've been reading previous reviews on this restaurant, and i've been here once before, so i thought i would try it again.  And... i would tend to be middle ground with all the reviews.  A lot rave that this is the best Fish n Chips,  some were ok with it.  Some loved the pork souvlaki, some were ok with it.  Yesterday i went in a group of 7.  We ordered the Halibut n chips, Pork souvlaki dinner, pork souvlaki in a pita, sweet potato fries. etc..  So i got to try a bit of everything.  Fish n Chips - i would give 4 out of 5. The only thing was the tarter sauce... was ok. Apparently the tarter sauce is freshly made daily.  Pork souvlaki dinner looked good, smelled good.  I give the taste 3.5 out of 5.   I think its the meat they use, i am comparing this to \"danforth souvlaki\".  It wasn't bad, not overcooked, just not up to expectation.    Sweet potato fries were good!  Place was pretty busy by 6-7.  Lots of people for take-out.  I would comeback for their fish n chip specials.  Service was good!! friendly.  One negative thing, was i just wanted a glass of water with a lemon, the waitress said that they don't give lemons with water, that lemon comes with the fish n chips.  No lemons came with the fish n chips. No other restaurant denied me a slice of lemon with a glass of water."}
{"text":"Great little place, one of my favs in the area (which happens to have a number of fish and chip places actually). Why? Well for starters, the gentleman who owns the establishment is lovely and personable. I think their portions are large and the fish to be yummy and not too bland, or overly breaded. I also really like that they make their OWN tartar sauce. So few places seem to do this. You get like 1-2 of those little packets.  One star off for having to buy the tartar sauce separately, and for it being rather small portions. I KNOW tartar sauce is not that premium of an item...why does no one include it in the price, or at least give a nice, proper portion? Such a small thing to make a big difference. That said, this is my first choice in the area. Would be interested in trying their pork souvlaki, but when you're going to the fish and chips place...it's sort of a given to get the fish and chips."}
{"text":"It was a toss up between trying this place, or Halibut House across the street(ish), and based on the reviews I decided on Bluenose.  I went in for take out, and got there just in the nick of time..from the time I got in and placed my order, 5-6 other people had come in to line up! I got the Halibut dinner (comes with fries) and paid $14.99. I only had to wait about 10 mins for my order, just long enough to grab some ice cream from next door. :) The fish was lightly battered and very tasty. Didn't taste soggy or greasy, just like nice, fresh fish! The French fries didn't look like anything special, but let me tell you - they were excellent. The right combo of size and crispness...I didn't think I was going to be able to finish my meal, but they were so delicious that I couldn't bear leaving any on my plate. I will definitely be coming back here, in fact the next day we probably would have had they not been closed!"}
{"text":"The food is awful and the service is worse.   Stay away."}
{"text":"This guy was a major asshole and this place serves overpriced, tasteless cafeteria food with bad hygiene. The place was not busy and when I asked if I had the number right because I called FOUR times and got no answer, he just rudely said they were too busy (though there were like just 3 people inside the place already eating). He said, \" if people call unknown name unknown number, I don't even answer. If they wanna hide and don't want to let me know who they are then I don't want to talk to them!!\" Like wtf. Grow the fuck up. These are your customers you douchebag. When I told him that my number is not hidden, he just interrupted me and repeated himself.  He was cleaning the counters with a dirty rag and then touched my food. Didnt even offer ketchup or salt or anything for my takeout.  Didnt smile once.  Fish was dry and stringy, fries were were bitter and starchy.   $18.00 for this shit?  No way!!!"}
{"text":"Great fish and chips spot in Markham. Can't decide whose is better, Blue nose or Danny's Fish and Chips.   Clean restaurant, very sociable and polite owners, good food.   Price is a little expensive, but the fish is always tender and juicy.   They just relocated to the unit right beside its old one where the donut shop used to be, and in their old unit will be a village ice cream. I think they are focussing more on dine-in customers now.  Overall no complaints about this place."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and this is probably the closest local restaurant to home for me. In my search for good local eats, I paid Bluenose a visit.  The first visit, I discovered that they were on summer vacation. So I had to wait until they reopened. No biggie.  I returned on the second day that they reopened and ordered the Halibut and fries of course. They must have still been on vacation mode because the halibut tasted overcooked. It was dry and very difficult to eat without the addition of tartar sauce. I was quite disappointed. There aren't many good local eats around here in the first place and this wasn't helping the cause. However, I gave them the benefit of a doubt and vowed to give it a second chance.  When I finally came back, I ordered the Halibut and fries again. Fortunately, this time, it tasted much better. The fish was not nearly as dry and flavorless. Maybe, they WERE still in vacation mode the first time around.  Bluenose was not a complete bust. I will come back again and try out some burgers, but I can't say this is my local favourite as of yet. Hopefully my future visits can change my mind, but until then, I will have to keep looking for a local restaurant to frequent."}
{"text":"A nice and sweet family owns the restaurant. I've gotten their fish soup, poutine, and their pork souvlaki dinner before. The fish soup is said to be homemade and it definitely tastes that way! The pork souvlaki comes with a salad, roasted potatoes and rice. The combination makes the dinner - potatoes are extremely soft and the rice is my favourite... very flavourable. Everyone who works there is always so nice and sweet"}
{"text":"The fish and chips and pork souvlaki dinner were all good, but still does not beat Granny Bonn's fish; and the Greek-run family business has lots of regulars that come in. I like their customer service, not forced but natural because they remember returning customer faces and treats them like friends. I liked that they had mushy peas on the menu...so hard to find that in a fish and chips shop.  But tables could be a bit cleaner and less sticky."}
{"text":"It should really be 3.5 Stars.  Food is not bad. Batter on the fish is not crunchy.  We have 2 people this visit, so we tried both halibut and haddock.... stay with the halibut.   Portion is generous.  The coleslaw is the surprising jewel!  Environment is dated, but the Server is friendly, makes it a very comfortable family restaurant."}
{"text":"I want my Lunch Specials!!   I placed my order for the Halibut Wrap/fries with pop ($7.95) at 12 pm or so on a Wednesday and the nice waitress inform me they were sold out! At 12 pm???  Since I really want to have some deep fried oily fish for lunch so I stuck with ordering  Halibut with chips ($10.95)  - The fish though small but was nicely done.. lightly breaded and deep fried to light golden brown. The fish itself was moist and fresh - I will skip the fries next time... nothing really specials..   50 cents extra for tartar sauce? that little tiny thing cost 50 cents? I think with the prices they charging they should just give the extra sauce for free!  Waitress was nice and efficient but can be a little pushy? She reminds me of someone's mother.. and I was told to be a good girl and  finish all my food... :)"}
{"text":"Nice little gem in the East end of Markham, delish fish and chips, super friendly service, and affordable price.   We came here for their lunch specials. $7.99 for haddock fish and chips with a pop; great price. It came with generous amount of fries and home made tartar sauce.    Tue night is Greek night, buy one soulaki dinner, get one half off. Lunch specials are from 11am to 3pm."}
{"text":"Our go to for fish and chips in the area.  Excellent service and recommend the coleslaw with halibut.  We always order extra coleslaw and tartar sauce."}
{"text":"Great local friendly fish & chip shop which is delicious however tonight I tried the chicken souvlaki & it was excellent as well.  Love the waitress there...Greek lady who remembers you & ensures you eat!! Support this local no franchise restaurant...I'm a fan of it."}
