{"text":"Pepper's Cafe is the \"Cheers\" of Toronto's westend.  If you go there a few times,  everyone will know your name.  For over 30 years, this local restaurant/bar has been serving up great meals and cold drinks to it's valued customers.  Joe and Judy Rodrigues(owners) will make you feel extremely comfortable with their hospitality and friendliness.  The waitressing staff are equally friendly and quick on their feet.   The food and drinks are served quickly(which is always a bonus).  The menu is not extensive but has soups, salads, classic and Portuguese style sandwiches as well as burgers and fries.  The daily specials are always made fresh and delicious. There are also desserts, coffee and an exceptionally well made espresso waiting for you.    Pepper's has also been supporting local and international bands for years.  Rock, Blues/Jazz and Salsa are just some of the sounds that can be heard on various Thursday/Friday nights throughout the year.   The patio is relatively large and a relaxing place to have a meal with a glass of wine or just sit back and enjoy a cold beer in the sun.    Pepper's Cafe is truly an gem of a spot, not only in Toronto's Westend but the entire city. Come on by and see for yourself....It's one big happy family!"}
{"text":"Great summer patio spot for a quick bite! The owner is from the Azcores,  and if you have visited the islands of Portugal or the mainland itself, than you will  understand when i say you will definitely feel like you're by the ocean eating a bifana with a beer! Or even wishing you were!"}
{"text":"Peppers is a decent place to come in for a quick breakfast or lunch.  Even a drink with a few friends after work.  It's what I would call bar fast food and in no way should be considered fine dining in any sense.  The service is friendly and the usual waitress is upbeat and helpful.  The menu is pretty basic and has the usual all day breakfast options, burgers and sandwiches.  There are also many steaks and other bar/pub type foods available.   The thing that sets peppers apart from the rest are the prices.  Some of the cheapest pints in the area let alone the city.  All the meals are also very inexpensive and it's very easy to get a full meal with drinks for less than $15.  The food isn't the greatest, but they make up for it with super inexpensive beers and menu items!  I'll be back in the near future for a pint!"}
{"text":"Oh man. This is the bargain of the summer!  This little place is located just north of Bloor and Landsdowne. It has a pretty descent patio and even if it has lots of people on, it doesn't feel too crowded.  The service is quite fast and very cordial.   Now, the food. The range of choices is pretty vast and the quantity isn't overwhelming.  Very well priced, the avg price for each item is in the ballpark of $5.   The ham and cheese sandwich was tasty like the \"prego\" sandwich (pork stake in a bun). But the real winner is the chicken wings.  The choice is between 12-18 and 24 pieces. Now, the whole msgs are very big but surely they are juicy and rich in flavour.  They come in 4 type: mild, medium, hot and honey mustard.   So, want to enjoy a pub fare for a very affordable price? Get your car and drive here. Or alternatively, you can hop off Landsdowne station and walk 5-10 mins north.   Give it a try, you won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"Peppers gets a five-star review for what it is: - a great neighbourhood bar. The owner is always on duty to make sure that everything is running smoothly and he is always friendly and caring. It is much favoured by local Portuguese especially from the Azores. The sports on the TV screens reflect this flavour also. The food is wholesome, basic, and inexpensive.  There are only two generic beers on tap. It often has good, free, live entertainment on Thursdays. It has a fantastic open patio which is in full afternoon and evening sunlight."}
{"text":"No one has Yelp'd about Peppers Cafe?!   WHAT GOD WOULD LET THIS HAPPEN - HAS THE WORLD GONE TO  THE DUMPS?!?!   *Grabs chair and begins tying a noose *   Before I hang myself - I might as well use a few of my last breaths to talk about this joint.....Let me just say that If there was a Portuguese version of Cheers this would be it.....  The food is okay and they don't have a great selection of beer on tap, but what this place doesn't have in taste - makes up for it in having the most heart. The staff are friendly, owners BLEED customer service, and overall has a VERY underrated patio. I suggest stopping by before the summer is out - grab a 3 dollar draft mug and kick up a leg or two.... also when I find my fridge empty of lunch making supplies, I have no issue with going in and asking to brown bag a sandwich for me.... like mama used to do!   Give this place a chance - go in with a heart and an empty stomach and leave with a filled one...... and the heart... don't forget the heart at Peppers Cafe."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Pepper's Caf√©.  It's not a fancy place and the prices are very reasonable.  I ordered a burger with peameal bacon (but no lettuce or onions) and fries.  It was a really good burger.  It seemed like it was \"homemade\" and was flavourful and hot.  I'd get it again.  Vania and Tyler were the servers.  They were really friendly and helpful.  I'll be back the next time I'm in this area."}
