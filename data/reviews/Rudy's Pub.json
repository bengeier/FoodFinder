{"text":"Ended up here after a good movie!!  It was Thursday night wing night 50cent wings. We order 2 sets of 5 wings and fries, a glass of wine, a shot of grey goose and a redbull. Well after eating (decent wings) and drinking we decided for another round at this moment I felt the lady getting irritated with our requests (napkin, don't chill the glass...etc). She would disappear and leave the bar with no bar maid. Another lady appears well say barmaid#2 very intoxicated and her appearance was messy. I guess it was a motion to go serve them \"black folks\"motion because the previous lady had enough, Long story we ended the night with a whopping $82.00 bill we paid the messy barmaid#2 we complained about how bad the customer service was from the first lady. She said who the OWNER down there? This broke down looking Anna Nicole Smith was the owner and had a jacked up attitude. How rude? After a number of complaints from the people we were sitting next too about 7 of us decided to leave and call it a night. Won't be back!!! This place is not going back to all white customers- so you really need to be happy and patronize WHO ever comes in your bar!!!  Very Nice inside love all the wood work, but Bad Service."}
{"text":"I love this place! People that come-in there are super nice. A laid back crowd, great music! Great drinks!"}
{"text":"Another dingy Cleveland haunt along with another set of sloppy servers who refuse to serve (waited 1 hour at the bar - no service). How do these people make a living? Or is survival a Cleveland mindset so not working hard is the goal? Sucks and I'll not be back."}
{"text":"This place was SERIOUSLY UNACCEPTABLE! 
So myself & mother decided to grab some wings on 50 cent wing night. Once we arrived & seated ourselves, it the waiter about 15-20minutes to even ask us for drink orders. So we ordered our food as well as drinks. 
Soooo once drinks come out, as soon as I took a sip of my water I noticed something floating around in my water, so now I'm livid! 
Check my moms drink, food particles floating around in her water as well. 
Disgusting & completely unsanitary.

So my mom went to talk to one of the workers about what was in the water & the lady said verbatim \"well you guys haven't ordered any food yet so just in the waters back and I'll bring you guys some more, and sometimes things just happen even if you were at home there could still be stuff your water, you just want me to cancel your order?\"

Like excuse me? Seriously? 

So of course me & my mom left.

Definitely NOT the correct thing to say to a first time customer. How about apologizing for about there BEING FOOD IN MY WATER. And showing your concern. 

I hope that the owner of this restaurant sees this review and seriously get some new workers/ hire a new & PROFESSIONAL staff."}
{"text":"Very nice comfy and cozy place that was very inviting  and the waitstaff supported the vibe of the program which to me meant alot. I also enjoyed that ruby's pub shared upcoming events that will happen at the pub which for a first time attendee was an excellent way to market without being aggressive."}
{"text":"I had the best drink call a Mean Green  at Rudy's Pub great service and good soup. Plenty of parking great staff."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really good and they play a good mix of r&b. The crowd is more mature which I love. I would suggest this place if you love smooth music while enjoying a beverage and laughing with good people."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely ridiculous. The service is horrible. My first experience there I thought it was a really nice place, mature crowd, good music, good food........ so I figured I had a nice little place to \"getaway, relax, enjoy myself......\" I went back several more times and my experiences going forward were ALL BAD......EACH AND EVERY SINGLE TIME. Honestly to me it's like the wait staff have arrogant attitudes. Almost like a take what you're getting or get the hell out of here. You wait FOREVER to even get acknowledged, then you wait FOREVER AGAIN after you've ordered, and LORD FORBID something is wrong with your order.........it's pretty much fuck you. On one occasion I ordered a Burger and they didn't bring me any condiments, it took forever to be acknowledged and once finally acknowledged I asked for a side of mayonnaise. The woman had an attitude because I even asked for mayonnaise and took 20 minutes for her to go back to even get it for me. It wasn't even a busy night, it was a week day evening........ my food had gotten COMPLETELY cold. When she FINALLY came back I told her my food was cold now and I just didn't want it. She said \"Ok\" as if in \"that's on you.\" Went away for awhile then finally came back, and asked me if I wanted a box for the food, I told her no I didn't want it, I was made to wait damn there a half hour after I asked for mayo and my food got completely cold. The bitch looked at me and laughed while walking away. Waste of time going here. Wouldn't recommend it for roaches and rats to roam around in. Disgusting service."}
{"text":"Really nice place.  For the 40+ age set.

Good food.  Football on Sundays on the big screen.  Karaoke Wednesday nights by DJ Gin-n-Juice

Nice place.  Good music. Live music I think on Friday nights"}
{"text":"Blah.  Too loud, dingy and the drinks were watered down. Hoping better watering hole arrive with the new van aken center"}
{"text":"Listen! the wings...! They are consistently delicious! Big, flavorful, and hot! This is a nice lil local spot with an older crowd but it's still social. Wasn't too crowded but enough for there to be a nice buzz of conversations and laughs. Drink prices are reasonable and I think it's Weds nights when it goes down on the karaoke side. lol I've been 3 times and enjoyed each visit. 
The wings though...they could teach others how wings are supposed to be!"}
{"text":"I met up with my girlfriend here around 9pm a few Friday's back.  She was already here with a few friends (they had dinner).  She said the Fish Fry was fantastic.  She said they got a little busy around dinner time, but only had one waitress.  The place is new, so they'll probably fix staffing on a weekend issue soon.
After 9pm the place was PACKED, and they had a few more waitresses on staff at this point.
Ours was very fast, and funny.  I will definitely hang out here again, and can't wait to try the food."}
{"text":"I stopped in one Friday night, not even realizing that the old Pub had closed and that this was an entirely new pub. But I decided to stay and I'm glad I did. It was about 10pm and the place was packed. There was a DJ playing, people dancing and the crowd was having a lot of fun. It was a great atmosphere. It was too late for dinner but I looked at a menu and everything looks delicious. I'm definitely going to go back for dinner. Overall, Rudy's seems like a great addition to Lee Rd and I'm glad they're there!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with Rudy's Pub. This staff is always helpful and easy to talk to. The wings are stupidly amazing. I've had the Cajun, garlic parm and sweet chili sauce (sorry I can't remember what the third kind was called) but they were all delicious. Everything is reasonably priced especially there happy hour."}
{"text":"The food and drinks was amazing but when I went to play music on the \"juke box\" it was declined because of the cook (part owner) (i suppose..I was handed back my $1 back which wasn't what I put in the machine) $5 back and said \"I don't like the rap beat!!\"..mind you I was playing Usher-No limit (R&B).. I get that I'm in Cleveland Hts and it's a little past happy hour but you decline me after I've had rounds of drinks and food? But Jut my money is good for other services but not YOUR music liking..who's the customer??? All in all go for food and drinks just no music!!

{"text":"Loving that there is a new joint on Lee road. Been there a couple times and it has a good vibe, good R&B, good mix of people. Cocktails and beer selection are everything you would need for a fun night out, and the food looks tasty although I have only drank here lol."}
{"text":"So happy to see another new place on Lee Rd.  We walked in and sat down - unfortunately there was a dance light flashing in our faces at the table.  It was also very very loud.  I ordered a Guinness and she brought me a bottle, figured she would have let me know they didn't have it on draft.  We ordered some happy hour wings - the lady said 6 came to an order, when they came out there were 4 wings and some sad previously frozen french fries.  They were still very good, crispy, not over or under cooked. We didn't stay for dinner, but the menu looked like it had nice array of offerings - but prices seemed a little high - $16.99 for perogies? 

We will be back sometime for dinner, hopefully we can find a table minus the dance club lighting."}
{"text":"Was there last night at 7p. The dump was closed.  Door locked and no sign up for reason it was closed."}
{"text":"While I was somewhat sad to see the Cedar Lee Pub go (I'll miss their awesome pretzels, but that's about it), I was mostly just disappointed that the restaurant was vacant. When I saw that Rudy's Pub was relocating to Lee Rd, I was definitely looking forward to trying it out. I finally had the chance at the end of January, when I met up with a friend for dinner and drinks there.

I ordered the fish fry. It was DELICIOUS. The fish was crispy and fresh. The fries were average. The portion was perfect, I thought; 3-4 pieces of fish and a good amount of fries. I can't remember what my friend ordered. There may have been tequila involved. Speaking of the tequila, owner Amanda is a HEAVY pour when it comes to shots, which can be both a good and bad thing! My friend's boyfriend and mine joined us later in the evening, around 9 pm and wings were ordered. I didn't eat any, my friend and her boyfriend said they were good.

Service was a little slow when we got there around 6:00 pm, but I think only the owner was waiting tables and working the bar. As the night went on, more servers arrived. Our server was hilarious and attentive.

I thought the atmosphere was great. I liked that they kept the PUB sign on the front of the building and they did an excellent job refinishing all the woodwork/tables. This white girl even got out and danced the Wobble (not well). The bar was packed when we left and I didn't think it was too annoyingly loud, even with the DJ playing music. I'd definitely go back. I'd like to try more items on their menu for sure!"}
