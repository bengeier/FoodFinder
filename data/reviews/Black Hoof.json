{"text":"Visit #1 Charcuterie Platter ($16 small/$25 large) & Thuet Bread ($2 small/$4 large )This is a wonderful introduction for those who have never tried charcuterie. Basically, charcuterie is a series of meaty products (cured, whipped & other preparation techniques) served on a wooden platter. All offered with a pile of full-seeded mustard, a dish of teeny-tiny pickled vegetables, and we ordered Thuet Bread on the side. The Thuet bread was soft & fresh - a great accompaniment. The star was the foie gras mousse - whipped to perfection, it just melts in your mouth.  Roasted Bone Marrow ($9) Hollowed with a little spoon & sprinkled with a bit of coarse salt on top of warm, smoky bread, this was tasty and good for the immune system. I reminded myself of the health benefits as I savoured each bit of fatty, rich, comforting flavour.  Tongue in Brioche ($13) The sandwich was a ridiculously generous portion of thinly sliced beef tongue between two plump slices of fragrant brioche, all held together with a skewered cornichons. A healthy (hah!) dose of mustard and tarragon mayo drizzled all over made my heart skip - whether it was in fear or excitement, I'm still not sure. Incredibly soft and tender, prior to this delight I didn't know that tongue could be this delectable. While I prefer the buttery & decadent Tongue Grilled Cheese at Hoof Cafe, I would never turn down this sandwich.  Raw Horse Sammy w/ Hot Sauce ($22) Fresh bread topped with horse tartar with a raw egg yolk & shallots on one slice, and a liberal helping of hot sauce on the other. The \"HORSE\" spelled out in sauce was a fun touch. I couldn't believe how tasty the raw horse meat was - I tried it with and without the hot sauce & bread to get a sense of the true flavour.  Visit #2 Crispy Pig Ear Salad Strips of breaded & deep-fried pig ears over radishes, carrots, edible flowers with a lime buttermilk dressing I liked the pig ears, but I found the dressing too buttery and generous on the salad. As someone who prefers light, acidic dressing (or none at all with the right greens!) it was unappetizing. However, I was at the Black Hoof so this was to be expected. The pig ears were crispy as advertised, and full of fatty-flavour with each bite. A dining companion claims that Buca does a better version...  Fluke Crudo Fluke along with charred fava beans, avocado cream, sliced chili, pancetta, herbs & cilantro dressing. I really liked the avocado cream and fava beans. A little heavy on the dressing (but again, it's Hoof!) but the combination of the sliced chili & cilantro was delightful with the fish. Love the plating :)  N'Duja & Corn Tagliatelle House tagliatelle noodles with charred corn, charred cherry tomatoes, and the n'duja which is a spicy calabrese salami melted into the pan. Garnished with a green onion salad on top. Mmm. I realy enjoyed this - house pasta was al dente and the creamy sauce blended very well with the charred corn and tomatoes. I still have trouble pronouncing it, but the n'duja was quite tasty with a bit of heat and I would happily order this dish again. Creamy, spicy, & corny goodness. I love sweet corn!  Pork Belly, Squid,& Melon Baby squid, Berkshire pork belly & chunks of melon in a watermelon glaze with turmeric, cumin. Flaxseed, Vietnamese cilantro, mint, & basil also riddle this succulent dish. While the pork belly and the squid were both well done and delicious, the pairing did not do much for each other. They were enjoyed separately with the watermelon glaze. I must have gotten a good chunk of watermelon, as a dining partner-in-crime said she didn't taste the melon but I certainly did. As usual, the pork belly made me pause to fully enjoy the flavour. So decadent and perfectly pan-cooked.  Calf's Brain Ravioli House ravioli in sage, brown sugar, & butter sauce with Parmesan shavings So...It was an oily mess, and I was very glum as a result. From the poor presentation, meagre calf brain filling, blah pasta, and too-sharp cheese I reluctantly ate all 5 raviolis wondering why I was even bothering with each bite. It was cooked al dente, just like the tasty tagliatelle, but I don't think that that is the best way to cook ravioli. Sigh. A fellow diner sampled a bit of my dish and agreed that it was simply not good. Darn it. But that's 1 bad dish out of so many amazing ones...so all is forgiven =)  Pics: http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/2010/08/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.html Pics: http://cookiesandtomatoes.blogspot.com/2010/09/black-hoof-charcuterie-dinner-love.html"}
{"text":"Place is a total scam retain a copy of your receipt because they add erroneous taxes and charge for items you do not order. Went there on a Monday night pretty empty but we received very poor service.  We ordered several drinks and charcuterie and the waitress asked if we wanted bread, and vegetables with it. We said sure why not.Charcuterie was fine, the bread was table bread and cold.  When the Bill arrived and we noted that we had been charged for bread an the vegetables that we didn't order but the server suggested to bring. In the history of charcuterie I have never heard of it being served without warm toasted bread or brioche as a counterpart.  We were also billed three taxes: HST1 8.5%, HST 2 (5.5%), and also a final 13% tax surcharge. When we asked the server for change, she pocketed five dollars of the 120 dollars we gave her returning to us 115. I was extremely disappointed with the service we received and I am considering reporting the taxation that was utilized on our cheque which we took a picture of. Been to gastropubs through out the world, and this is ranked as an overly hyped imitation of what an established ought to be."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing. The staff (every single one of them!) is friendly, welcoming, passionate, and knowledgeable. The food was adventurous and creative, and everything was delicious. Don't miss the tongue, and the syrah they have right now is to die for. Also, I know this seems odd, but it's true: best manhattan (and best cherries) I've ever had. Well worth the price."}
{"text":"The restaurant looked the part with a cool atmosphere and attractive staff. The food was good and different, which is what I like. Good job."}
{"text":"I can say with absolute certainty that this was one of the best meals I have ever had in my life.   We started with the horse tartar, simply because it's not something you see every day, and the notorious scandal over the meat was still fresh in mind.  If something is taboo - you just have to try it! And am I ever glad we did.  Served with scallion and fennel, and topped with a raw egg, the tartar was creamy, spicy, and chewy in the most wonderful way. Horse is VERY lean, and resembles high quality beef in taste and texture. I would order this again in a heartbeat, and encourage you to try it if you visit!   Next was the bone marrow, and sweetbreads with pumpkin puree.  Both dishes were delicious in their own ways. I wasn't too fond of the bone marrow on its own - it was lovely but I thought it might be a bit firmer - however when paired with the accompanying chimichurri and sea salt the marrow really shone through.   The sweetbreads were easily my favourite out of the meal. I wish I had more of them, because they seemed to just melt in your mouth. The pumpkin puree and small spots of balsamic reduction just sent my palette to heaven and back.   The special of the night was duck confit, with blood sausage, foie gras sausage and a white bean accompaniment.  I know it must sound like I'm embellishing, but I was quite tempted to lick the plate clean, right there, in front of the staff and other diners.  The duck was cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside, moist and flavourful on the inside, with all of the juices running out and mixing with the beans after every cut... It was just decadent. Not to mention the sausages themselves! The fois link was wonderfully silky and just a little but sweet at the end. Where the blood sausage was a slight bit dense and packed with spices that seemed to burst in your mouth.   All in all - if you're feeling adventurous and want to taste \"odd\" cuisine that is prepared in a way that will blow your mind - Go to The Black Hoof.  It's a little pricey, but it's completely worth it."}
{"text":"Saturday night at 7pm  we thought it was going to be packed with long line up, surprisingly it was half empty but got full quickly, so we were just lucky. there were only 2 of us, so we ordered: 1. bone marrow - was good but not orgasmic as someone else described... the green sauce/side came with it was tasty. bone marrow is oily, which went well with the bread (btw, burnt bread)  2. spicy horse tartare - our favorite dish, at first sight, my bf said, \"where is the horse\", then we found them underneath the fried potato sticks. interesting flavours makes up for the lack of portion. btw, server was embarrased about serving horse meat when inquired regarding where is the meat from. she shouldn't be. 3. tongue on brioche - we thought we need to hit another restaurant before going home, howerver the tongue was more than filling for both of us. the meat was the tender version of ham, reminds me nothing of tongue. it came almost like Montreal Smoked Meat sandwich. a bit on the salty side. the mustard seeds were overwhelming... don't put too much. 4. gin blossom - grapefruit juice + gin, it was so fresh that i actually tasted some pulp...   service - more than what we expected. the lady was friendly and quick on service. they don't wait for you to ask.  it would definitely make a great place for group hangout, but try to come in even numbers to avoid embarassing sitting arrangment!"}
{"text":"Black Hoof is the ultimate place to go for a cute date night, a girl pow-wow, or just good ol' time with friends.  We sat at the bar, which is my favourite place to sit, and ordered the Charcuterie board, Cheese plate, Black olives, and the Bone Marrow. It was all divine. I was a bit reluctant to try the Horse meat but realized it all just tasted like amazing Ham :)."}
{"text":"I waited too long to try this place out, it was a very good experience! The food here is not for everyone, but I'm telling you, if you find your adventurous side please do check it out! You will not be disappointed! We were blown away by the Tongue on Brioche, Bone Marrow and Tacos. The tacos and Tongue sandwich were simply, an overwhelming explosion of flavour on my palette! It's one of those places where you order something crazy and you try it and it really just opens your mind. I had no idea tongue could be so fregging delicious!! Seriously worth the wait, a must try on any food lovers list. I will become a regular at this amazing food joint."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant in Toronto's west end. Perfect for 2 people - I wouldn't recommend a group of more than 4.  Cocktails were just as good as those in their counterpart, Cocktail Bar, which is my absolute favourite place for a good cocktail. Everything I had was was delicious, which included the bone marrow and foie. This place is not good for a closed-minded eater. It seems that not everyone would choose to eat bone marrow, sweetbreads, and horse tartare - but that leaves more for the rest of us. This place is a 5 out of 5 in every aspect."}
{"text":"Visited the Black Hoof last night and what a treat. Place was recommended from a friend and I can't thank her enough. Tongue on brioche was delicious. Drinks were amazing. Definitely will be returning."}
{"text":"Black hoof really lived up to the expectation and beyond.   It's really tough to review a place that already has 197 reviews as of right now and counting.   so what's to love? Excellent service. And fantastic food. I tried 3 dishes: the oxtail and scallop, pork belly, and tongue brioche. All very good. But I have to admit that the pork belly was really special. I'm salivating as I type this... so when you go here, order the pork belly...  My only minor complaint here is that the portion sizes are a bit too small..."}
{"text":"Yes it is as good as they say it is!  First time I came with 3 friends on a Saturday - and couldn't wait for 2 hours. This time, Thursday nite @ 7, 2 of us were seated right away.  Was worried about the no credit cards but they take debit.   Started with the guava margarita: perfect sweet/salt/tart blend. Delicious!  Had the charcuterie, of course! I repeat all good things said about it. If you go here, you MUST order it.   The blood sausage and beet salad was surprisingly mild, with beautiful soft textures and a well balanced flavour accented with fresh basil. Had the Foxcroft Riesling which paired well.   Even though I was a bit nervous, I trusted the reviews and had the tongue on brioche- just like pastrami! I enjoyed it and the purple mustard is delicious. It is a really heaping pile of meat!  Date had the foie gras on brioche - tender, soft and sooooo rich!   Our server was also great: friendly and attentive.  We were both too full to try the fresh daily dessert.   We were in a meat induced euphoric state for a long time after. Looking forward already to the next visit - when I might be brave enough to try the raw horse!"}
{"text":"I'll second the comment about the Jamon Iberico, the softest, tastiest cured ham you may find. Not too salty, so much flavor, but, can I just say this, for $30, not quite enough.  We also went for a cheese plate and the olives and bread. Great flavors, each cheese served with it's own unique accompanying gelatin/mustard/etc. The olives were a beautiful flavor and texture. Should I use the word flavor again?  Had a decent 2005 Rioja for not bad $$--but it's stock LCBO stuff. You really need to pay decent coin for a good Rioja but I fall for them every time. I do wish that more restaurants would do what the owners of Terroni do, import your own unique collection of wines. Terroni does it and still offers great wine for a moderate price. I'm sure the Iberophiles at Black Hoof could find stuff that we will never see at the LCBO.  Loved the room... dark and warm. Good service. Wouldn't hurt to have a menu for the desserts (either on the wall or printed)--I couldn't hear our server at all when she tried to describe them--so no dessert. (Did I say that the place is busy and loud. Personally I like it that way.)   Anyway, Black Hoof is a great food experience, and not to be missed."}
{"text":"Pure quality in every way, please dont look for somewhere else to eat after 11pm on anynight because this is the only place worthy of it.  Ian that is an amazing margarita see you soon"}
{"text":"I took myself out to the Hoof last night for my birthday. This makes my third visit in the last year. In fact, my first visit was my birthday last year. Overall the food at the Hoof tends to be exquisite. I think, however, based on my experience last night that the foods are best enjoyed in a small group. My fairly modest meal was more expensive than I would have liked by far.  The good:  The Southern Fried Sweetbreads. (15) I love that they smoke their sweetbreads. It adds so much body to the flavour. They cook these to perfection I love the crispy exterior and chewy interior. The creamed Collard greens and cornbread were a nice accompaniment to the dish. Hot sauce and apple cider vinegar reduction worked very well.   The bad: The Foie Gras. (24) Last year on my birthday I got the foie gras. It was perfection. Two large chunks of lobe seared to dripping buttery perfection on a brioche round with a tangy caramelized onion compote. The last two times I have visited they have turned foie gras into a dessert. I don't like it. In my opinion, it should be a savoury dish. There should be something acidic to cut through the buttery luxury of the foie. I disliked this cookie crumble vanilla mascarpone crap they served with it this time around. The foie was perfectly cooked as per usual but the portion was tiny. It was about half of the portion I've received before. Until they get it right I won't order this again.   The Interesting: I arrived at 6:10 on a Friday night and there were 2 seats available at the bar. The whole place was filled with a 45 minute wait list. Clearly they're not hurting for business.   The Booze: I like the selection of alcohol here. I had an Innis & Gunn (6.50) and a Ricard (8).     I like the Hoof a lot but I felt that $60 before tip was a bit vulgar for the meal I ate. Regardless, I will be back and I'll continue to plead with them to improve/restore the Foie Gras."}
{"text":"What an amazing corner spots this place runs.  I wish they would bring back their breakfast place.  Damn that was good!!!!    Black Hoof are kind and gracious hosts.  They accomidate everyone, and i have noticed a few times that when you order a dish for 5 people, they will make sure there are five pieces on the board, or dish without telling you that it isn't enough.    My favourite is the liver and onions, the horse tar tar (unbelievable),  and the tacos.  Order the meat board if you have more than two people, or else you will be too full to order all the other good stuff.  If you can get a seat on the patio you are in luck!!"}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD. I ordered everything off the menu. The blood sausage, the sweet potato salad... The cocktails with the cute little cloves. Love the attention to detail Our red-head waitress was really sweet too and made eye contact with everyone ;)"}
{"text":"I finally made it to The Black Hoof and wasn't disappointed. I loved the food and atmosphere. We came right at 6pm when it opened for dinner and were lucky to get one of the few tables left.  We had: Tongue on Brioche - delicious and actually kind of reminded me of Montreal smoked meat. It came with purple mustard, couple of baby pickles and sauteed onions.  Beef Heart Frites - frites were fried string thin taro and the tongue was a bit tough but it is heart after all. The sauce gave it a good kick & was delicious with the heart.  I am probably going to be lambasted by this but it tasted like a thick creamy version of Taco Bell's spicy sauce (my friend agreed so I don't feel like I'm completely off). The serving is large enough for 4 people to share.  Lamb Brain Ravioli - the ravioli was really lemon-y and it wasn't stuffed with a lot of brain so the lemon overwhelmed the dish. So I can't say that I really know what lamb brain tastes like but since I like lemon, I did enjoy the dish.  Foie Gras on Brioche - !!!!!! Melt in your mouth goodness. Best dish of the night. The foie was so delicious & full of flavour on its own, I ate it without the brioche.   The waitresses came by often to change our cutlery. It was nice that we were able to really taste all the dishes without having the different dishes' flavours mix together.  My friend and I left complete stuffed since the dishes were so rich. We weren't even able to enjoy the apps at my friend's party that we went to afterwards (and we're both huge eaters).  It was lovely. Rubbing my belly lovely."}
{"text":"We hoofed it over on Dundas and walked in at 10:30p and chose to sit at the bar where we had a view of the kitchen action.   House smoked procuitto was tops.  The duck tacos have me drooling days later.  The other 17 meats we sampled were equally as wonderful.   Service was great.  Place is cool.  Lucky us!"}
{"text":"Drool!!!!  The food is sooooo good!  I had only been back to eating meat for 4 months after being a vegetarian for more than 5 years before trying this place for the first time and this place wowed me.  It is my favorite restaurant in Toronto!  Every dish, including the drinks, and dessert  was original and yummy.  The tongue sandwich, the pork belly and the dessert (almond biscuit type thing with sage ice cream and pumpkin bits) were my favorite dishes.  I felt like the service was very good, however, the dishes seem to come out of the kitchen very very slowly..  I can't wait to go back and try  some new dishes!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to celebrate a birthday. at this tapas restaurant that doesn't take reservations, but was still worth the wait.  The menu consists of maybe 12-18 items.  The food in general is good, and the service is as well, but I wouldn't say it was anything special.  Some dishes were better than others.  The blood sausage was quite heavy, like a pate.  I wasn't a big fan of this dish.    I would recommend the tongue on brioche and the pork carnitas tacos. Their cocktails are quite nice and refreshing."}
{"text":"Went here recently by myself after a concert at the Phoenix. I hadn't eaten all day after standing for 5 straight hours and coming from work before that.    Walked into the Hoof around 10 expecting to be seated at the bar or something even though it was Saturday (it was also dreadfully rainy so I figured that was in my favour). Was dismayed to hear of a wait of at least an hour. Left my name, my number, and hoofed it over (couldn't resist sorry!) to the Hoof Cafe. Ordered a sweetbread and tongue stew that wasn't on the chalkboard menu and before it got there, I got a call that they would be able to seat me. The woman behind the bar was awfully nice about it and walked across the street to ask them to hold my seat for me until I finished my stew.  I burnt my tongue in my eager, hungry rush in finally having something to eat after a long time so I didn't get to taste the dish as well as I would have liked. It was warm, thick, salty, full of beans, and most importantly full of meat. However it felt a bit toooo salty. After I finished, I paid my bill, run across the street, sat down and ordered the lardo crostini and the n'duja and fennel sandwich.  The lardo crostini was a tiny thing but for 2 bucks I got what I expected. Tasted mostly of rosemary with a touch of flavour from the lentils under the lardo. The sandwich kind of suffered the same problem with the overload of fennel on top of it. It tasted of fennel, the n'duja under it still left a nice spicy burn/aftertaste in my mouth but the open-faced sandwich aspect of it still made for awkward eating. All in all: only an okay meal.   Addendum: While my review may not sound like it's worth 4 stars (it's not), a good part of that score is based on a previous visit I had done about a month ago that was pretty much great. Sure, it can be flawed at times but I honestly can't complain about a menu that frequently changes like Black Hoof's. The service is nice, the atmosphere is good, the waiting is terrible but oh so worth it. (Maybe that is their secret ingredient: hunger does make for the best condiment after all)"}
{"text":"Found the fav spot in Toronto! Was fine and comfortable setting for dining alone (aka. biz trip) in the shady back patio.  Staffs were so nice! They offered 1/2 size order on some of the dishes- meaning I could try more items on the menu. Great when i only got couple of days in town. How awesome!!!  Followed Yelp's pic collections and ordered: 1) Horse tartare- bucket list of food to eat before i die. It tasted more pleasant than I expected. Tender and nicely seasoned with capers and cornichons. 2) Pistachio hummus and chicken liver- very balanced and savory. 3) Bone marrow- sooo good and sooo fatty! Chimichuri and flakes of sea salt were excellent pairings.  Could only finish 1 since I prob wont have time to jog for 10 miles after this meal.  4) Cavatelli pasta with spring veg- (was debating on this one... hmm isnt it summer now?) this turned out to be the best dish!!! All the tiny chunks of turnip, beans, peas, and almonds played so well with this delicate pasta!"}
{"text":"Wow didn't think place would stink this bad. Service is the worst! Food omg going to puke it out now"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Get there before 6pm so you don't have to wait outside. The wait staff are super friendly and they have a great sense of style. You don't need to dress up to dine here. Its easier to get a table if you go as a party of 2. Its not an ideal place if you have a lot of people (5 ppl +). The foie gras/nutella was an interesting dish but it is pricey ($25), if you don't mind spending the money, its worth a try."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in TO for a day and decided to come here on Anthony Bourdain's recommendation. We are still new to the world of offal, and this place kicked it up a notch for us.   It was the perfect night to start off our vacation! The back deck was enclosed and blocked out the noise but still let us enjoy the perfect weather. We came at 6, so it was still quiet and the service was great.   We ordered bone marrow to start. I've never had it before, so to me it seemed like really greasy butter and wasn't that exciting. I have nothing to judge it against though, so I am going to assume that's what it was supposed to be like. If so, A+ !  Then we shared an order of the sweetbreads which were DELICIOUS. Don't shy away from these if you want to be adventurous but still enjoy your meal.  Next was the Foie Gras on Waffles, and finally the Tongue on Brioche. The tongue was my favourite of the two... the combination with the bread and sauce was just amazing.  The dessert menu didn't appeal to us that night. I've heard of other desserts they've had which are amazing though.   We didn't try any cocktails, but the beer selection wasn't too bad.   Highly recommend this place! It's great fun and I wish I could go back soon to try more!"}
{"text":"If I had to choose only two things I could put in my mouth, I'd probably have to go with cured meat and red wine, though not necessarily in that order.  The Black Hoof has excellent selections of both, and it's open really late.  What more needs to be said? Dig it."}
{"text":"My top recommendation in Toronto for the last two years. Creative and delicious dishes; wonderful and inventive drinks. Pretty much every time. Great people too.  Cash/CAN debit only. No reservations. Go early/late or you'll end up waiting it out in line.  A short and compact review to contrast with how much I like this place (plus, everyone's said it already)!"}
{"text":"While the food I had was good I don't think it really lives up to the hype. First of all, I've never been a fan of the no-reservations policy, but I guess if you really want to go, you can just show up early.   As I previously stated, the food was good but not fantastic. The charcuterie plate had a bit of everything, but not enough bread to enjoy it with. The bone marrow was tiny and the rabbit and tartare were good, but not out of this world."}
{"text":"Delectable fancy food without the stuffy/uppity atmosphere. A really low-key chill restaurant with deliciously unique small dishes. The horse tartar is a must!!!  Best tartar I've ever had! Also the cocktails are on point. Had an amazing experience here, the server we had was very prompt and friendly. The plates are reasonably priced for the quality of culinary craft that you receive. Best restaurant in Toronto, IMO."}
{"text":"I decided to take my gf here for her birthday as I know she loves eating guts and what not  I've been to a similar restaurant before in Chicago called The Purple Pig so I knew she would like it... Anyways,  First off we ordered the bone barrow with sea salt on the side accompanied with bread.  The sea salt really brings the richness of the marrow out.  It was very tasty and I highly recommend it  We then ordered the chutakure which is basically that just cured meats which they had prepared themselves.  This was alright... I've never been one to order these kinds of meats but the waitress said that this was a popular dish.  There were many different flavour which tasted...well... like salami and pepperoni ... sorry... but nonetheless I guess I still enjoyed it  We ordered the pork belly tacos which were awesome!!  The meat well seasoned very well.  I definitely would recommend this place for my friends.  It's different than other restaurants due to the size the the kind of food they serve.  If you are a fan of animal innards come here and I guarantee you'll enjoy the food and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I left hungry. The bill was huge. They informed us that they needed our table before we were ready to leave. Tiny portions and bad service. Wouldn't go back. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"We went there early 2012.  High expectation due to tonnes of great reviews.   We made the earliest reservation on a Saturday - party of 6.  Waited in line before the restaurant open.  Love the rustic decor, service was great.  But as Canadian Chinese, all the exotic food selections were not impressive.  Perhaps we are so use to bone marrow, tongue, heart  etc.  Also, the portion was small, my friend had to order 2 dinner plates before he felt less hungry.  For me and my husband, we decided to go grab burritos from burrito boyz after, and even after that we had enough room for home made chocolate waffle at my friend's place."}
{"text":"Roasted Bone Marrow. Thats it. I'm done. I can die happy."}
{"text":"Mind-blowingly good!  I went a few months ago and it was so amazing, I had to go back a few weeks later.  Keep an open mind, and you won't be disappointed.  But definitely check their opening hours, because they are a bit odd (as they admit themselves).  The place fills up quickly, so if you can get there right when it opens, it helps.  But their cocktail bar across the street is also wonderful, if you have some time to kill.  Menu changes often, but if they have it, I highly recommend the charcuterie, tongue on brioche, horse tartare and foie and nutella!     None of the individual dishes are particularly pricey - but since you'll want to try several things, it can add up.  Oh, and I don't think they take credit card, so check before you go!   Yum!"}
{"text":"Yeah it's got a funky atmosphere but some times too much hype is not a good thing! Food is decent. Not worth the wait for a table. There are better places to drop some bills around the corner on Ossington."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to give this restaurant a try after seeing numerous good reviews, and it did not disappoint. We ordered pickles, horse tartare, chonchinita pibil tacos, pork jowl katsu, tripe karaage, and bone marrow. Every dish tasted great, especially the horse tartare and tacos. The dishes portions were reasonable and great to share with someone else. If you're curious in trying new foods and a meat lover then I highly recommend this restaurant.   Service was prompt and friendly, they also explained the menu well and described exactly what we were eating when the dishes arrived.   Finding this place was hard, as they do not have a sign for their restaurant (I guess hipster places are like that)! It's actually right across the street from their cocktail bar."}
{"text":"I'm new to Toronto and when I asked around a work everyone said this was the best restaurant in town. I ordered the bone marrow and the scallops. Both great choices. The food was inventive and tasty. The service on the other hand needs a bit of improvement. Our waiter seemed overwhelmed. Would try to go back on a week night when its not so busy."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that truly lives up to its hype. I love it and if it wasn't for Yelp, I don't think I would've ever discovered this amazing restaurant.   I went on a weekend evening with 2 friends. The place was bustling - the dim lighting and small space only enhanced the casual, non pretentious atmosphere. We were seated at the bar and the bartender recommended cold sake to start. I don't have that much experience with sake but it was refreshing and crisp.   Now on to the food. Between the 3 of us, we shared: - Horse Tartare: I like it more than beef tartare! Very tender and delicious. The plate comes with dollops of a special cream that goes very well with the raw meat.   - Bone Marrow: unforgettable dish. I love the slimy texture (which, by the way, is very different than meat fat) on its own or with the toasted bread. With a slight pinch of the coarse/seal salt added, it brings out the flavour of the natural meat juices. I don't usually like to re-order the same things when I go back to a restaurant. But I definitely will make an exception for Black Hoof's bone marrow.  - Pork Carnita Tacos: not usually a taco fan but these tacos were so so so juicy and gushing out with flavours. Level of saltiness was just right. This was my friends' favourite dish of the night.   - Sweetbreads: we all thought it was bread that was sweet... so imagine our reaction when the waiter clarified that for us! Though the texture was nothing like I had experience before, It was smooth and palatable. I like it a lot and if you can get over the fact that it is veal thymus glands, you will find it to be a very interesting dish.  These dishes were pretty heavy, despite its small sized-portion. However, because they were rather greasy, we didn't think dessert or additional food were needed after! After visiting Black Hoof, it made me realize how much I enjoy being adventurous with food. I will definitely return and I also think this place is very suitable for a cute date (assuming that these unconventional dishes aren't TOO far out from both parties' comfort zones)."}
{"text":"This is truly a place to experience! You need to be brave as the menu is definitely one of a kind, but everything is prepared and made to perfection. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone with a sense of adventure. If you're a picky eater, stay away (or learn to live a little)!"}
{"text":"Best food experience ever, the chefs are artists, the food is amazing, Service is top notch and the atmosphere is just perfect.  This is probably the best restaurant in Toronto. If you can afford it, go and buy all the food you can eat, it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Hands down best meal I have ever had in Canada.  Very interesting dishes, My boyfriend and I didn't quite know what to get and we asked the waiter for his recommendations and we did not regret that. Had 4 different dishes to share, and they were all amazing. We even ordered 2 dishes of the pigs ear slaw, sooooooo gooood!!!  Nice calm ambience as well."}
{"text":"The food is always top notch!  Bone marrow, which I think is a staple menu item, is amazing.  Tongue on Brioche and horse tartare are great as well.  Since the menu rotates you get a chance to try something new, which I like.  Cocktails are pretty decent too. Overall, probably one of very few restaurants in Toronto I would not hesitate to recommend."}
{"text":"Culinary adventure, indeed! The restaurant has a meat-heavy menu so if you're not feeling carnivorous, don't go. I took yelp recommendations and ordered the beef marrow, which I found nauseating. I don't eat really fatty food normally so I think my system was shocked. We got the charcuterie plate, which I wouldn't order next time. It wasn't bad, just not a knock-out. We also got the pork belly...DELICIOUS. So it was hit and miss for us. The table beside us said the sweetbreads are a go-to item as is the tongue in brioche.   I really liked the pickle plate and the olives so I guess I'm just not a true carnivore and maybe should stick to other food joints."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and we left super full! We got there early so we waited on the little bench outside the restaurant. It was fun to watch the employees of Black Hoof run back and forth across the street from the cocktail bar to the black hoof to the raw bar.  Anyways, we shared the house cured meats board, a small side of bread, and the tongue on brioche. Everything tasted great and the service was very attentive. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Okay, so the ambience is lovely, and the drinks are superb, and there is a fuckload of meat on offer, all of which seems like it should mean that I absolutely loved this place.  And I'm not sure why I didn't, except that I was turned off by the nickel-and-diming: you can get a charcuterie plate, sure, but it doesn't come with bread or olives or cheese--if you want any of those, you have to order it separately.  And maybe it's just because charcuterie is everywhere right now, but there wasn't anything about Black Hoof's that stood out.  Still, the service was fantastic and the pickled octopus was absolutely delicious, so I don't regret the meal by any means.  Just, I probably won't bother to go back."}
{"text":"Great selection of unique cuts of meat. Charcuterie board also comes with chicken fat which was rich with flavor. Beef tongue sandwich was super soft. Overall, at end of meal, we thought everything was on the oily side. Expensive for the portions you get. Also expensive for an upscale restaurant that really doesn't have a kitchen. You walk by pass it as you go into their back patio, consisting of an electric oven and griddle. No credit cards and only cash or canadian debit cards allowed. I think you can get just as good food for half the price elsewhere. Way too hyped up."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite restaurant in Toronto. The food is amazing & the prices are very reasonable. I recommend the charcuterie board with an order of bread & olives to start with. The oxtail & scallops dish is hands down the best thing on the menu. The bone marrow is also worth trying. The pork carnitas tacos are a good choice for the unadventurous, tasty but standard. Keep in mind this restaurant is small, I'd say keep it to groups of 8 or less. Our group of 10 was accommodated, but it was a tight squeeze.  The Black Hoof Raw Bar next door has excellent oysters & the fish board is surprisingly delicious, but it's pricier & the service is sub par. You'll wait forever for your food. We asked for two more orders of bread while waiting on our fish boards. The bread was placed clearly on the counter for our waiter to give to us. It never arrived at our table. We ended up wrapping our check early & leaving. Stick to the charcuterie & cocktails side."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, especially the raw horse sammy. Everything has already been said. The only thing bad is the wait but since the food is so good, its worth it."}
{"text":"The Blood Custard here is to die for! Everything else my table ordered was also delicious.  This place can cook anything (including all the gross sounding bits)  and make it taste divine.  Be brave and dig in, your taste buds will thank you.  Perhaps only ask for details of what you are eating after the meal is finished! ;)  Also has a small but nice selection of craft beer.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Was there April 2012 (not July 2013). Prices and menu items may have changed. Sorry for the delay posting.  First of all, if you want the Gypsy Woman, this is where you get it - it's not on the card across the street.   My party of four arrived at 6 pm for our first time Virgin Black Hoof experience  and had:  Cheese Platter $18, cheese was delish but would pass on this next time - quantity isn't worth it.  Cured Meats $19, mortadella was the bomb, next time would order the housemade prosciutto (as everyone else around us did).  Bread, two orders, yah I'll pay for this bread $4  We had a Barbera D'Alba $50 a pop. Went well with the food.  Carpaccio $16, there was  crispy Panko like topping, and something yummy and sweet underneath. Will have to ask next time. We all enjoyed this.  The Liver and and Onions $14 - probably the biggest disappointment. It was pretty much an aunappetizing pate smear in a deep bowl - not the prettiest presentation. The cippolini onions were the hilight of this dish.  Pork Taco $11, sooo goooood we ordered it three times.  Tongue Brioche Sammy $14 -  OMG, I always loved tongue. I've just never had it like this. Better than any pastrami sammy out there. If your dining companion's companion isn't adventurous, say it's pastrami, she'll never know the difference.   And for dessert, Foie gras on carrot cake with a side of Greek Liquid Gold (which is actually Mavrodaphni, a sweet Greek dessert wine or can be chilled and served as an apperitif as we had). $25 for the the dessert and $7 for a pretty little glass of GLG. Very rich yes, but a wonderful ending to an unforgettable meal.   Pass on the Blood Custard $8. The toppings were creative (crispy onion, pear and cilantro) but the pudding just didn't work in my book.  Service was attentative. Our second in command was a doll. Food was timed perfectly.  ps: Ok, they don't take a rez, so show up at 6 pm and you'll get a table.... and that's that.   pss: did go across the street to the Cocktail Bar and after finding out there was no Gypsy Woman to be had, I ordered a Taylor of Panama - a kick ass cocktail with a fabulous 10 year old rum. Just what you need to sit and sip while you discuss the kick ass meal you just had across the street. Staff there rocks, too!   psss: you have to be adventurous Toronto. if you're not, stay home, order pizza, have the same old thing, sure - but you will never be able to say \"I ate and drank at the Black Hoof\".   And with most beautiful experiences in life, they are all too fleeting."}
{"text":"Popped into the Black Hoof Saturday night after drinks at Cocktail Bar.  Shared a platter of house cured meats and enjoyed more amazing drinks including Jen's new drink the Gypsy Woman which contains bourbon, red wine, cherry syrup, lemon, lime and sour cherry bitters ($12).   Service was top-notch as always, decor is causal and comfortable.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"dessert is disappointing. The only okay item is the foie gras pancake, but I have experienced a much better one in \"The Burger Priest\""}
{"text":"Charcuterie is the new black, bitches.   Any hip restaurant that wants to be taken seriously in this town has some kind of charcuterie platter on its menu (e.g. Union, Nota Bene, Table 17). I'm bracing myself for the day McDonald's offers its own watered-down version (tongue on sesame seed bun and confit McMuffin, perhaps?) in some twisted trickle down effect--like the cerulean blue of the infamous \"lumpy\" sweater in The Devil Wears Prada. And, if so, The Black Hoof is poised to be Miranda Priestly.   Charcuterie at The Black Hoof is a big deal. It's so big, the word \"charcuterie\" is written on their chocolate-brown awning more prominently than the actual name of the establishment (etched in tiny letters on the storefront window).  Our dream team of diners that night included Neil T., Jay G., Ariel G. and his Mrs. G. -- all adventurous diners who wouldn't be squeamish about a little tongue in their mouths. We arrived early enough to grab that plumb 6-top in the front*, away from the chatter of the young, hipster crowd that has made The Black Hoof a very unlikely playground.**  We started with cocktails which I'd heard were specialty-creations on the ever-rotating menu of delights at TBH. I had a Bittersweet Symphony ($11), a refreshingly tart aperitif featuring rye and grapefruit bitters; Mrs. G. had a \"My-Tie\"; and Jay had a Manhattan. The drinks displayed The Black Hoof's creativity and attention to detail, and were a harbinger of amazing things to come.  Now on to the food...  Charcuterie (large, $25): A generous board (changes daily) that included foie gras, terrine, guanciale, duck liver mousse, spicy chorizo, sopressata flecked with blueberries, and several other cured meats shaved so thin Stevie Wonder could read braille music through them. Served with toothsome brown bread, house-made mustard and pickled vegetables.  Roasted bone marrow ($5 each): Oozy, flavorful, just perfect on baguette rounds with a sprinkle of flaky, sea salt.    Tongue on brioche ($13): Thin ribbons of tongue drizzled with tarragon mayonnaise on buttery brioche. Never has such an unholy, unkosher creation tasted so divine. Served with exotic purple mustard.    Raw Horse Sammy ($22): Arrived right as we were finishing up the tongue and as good as it was, we all got collective whiplash as we ogled this head-turning knockout of a sandwich. It's seasoned horse tartare served open faced on toasted light rye, garnished with capers and crowned with an egg yolk on top. The word \"HORSE\" is playfully scrawled in hot sauce mayo on the matching slice of bread.   The horse is shimmering; ruby red with a velvety melt-in-your-mouth texture almost like sashimi-grade tuna. Sandwiched between the two crisp layers of thin rye, each bite launched crazy fireworks in my mouth. We all loved it so much we immediately ordered another one to share.  Dessert ($7): Chocolate and bacon bread pudding with orange-citrus creme fraiche. Not too sweet but not too exciting either.  Wine: Excellent selection by the glass or bottle including a bold '04 Rioja and an '06 Zinfandel from The Lyeth Estate, which paired with the meats surprisingly well.  Service: Young, good-looking but also knowledgeable and helpful--a rare and noteworthy combination.   Decor and Crowd: A little bit French brasserie and a little bit Spanish tapas cellar. No suits but plenty of skinny jeans and pointy shoes.   Yipes. I've overwritten again. But that's how enthusiastic I am about this place. Go if you want to try new things and see what talented hands can do with meat, both humble and posh. Or don't, and help cut down on the waiting time for my next visit. _________________________ * No reservations so come early or be prepared to wait **How do they manage to fit into their skinny jeans after eating all this pork fat?"}
{"text":"Simply the best charcuterie plate in Toronto. Their homemade Ilardo is extraordinary and the portions here are in enormous. Staff is friendly and unpretentious and are willing to help you with any thing you need. I was worried when I arrived after hearing all the hype, but it really was well worth it. I visit Toronto frequently, and this is always a must stop."}
{"text":"I looooooved Black Hoof!  I'm a meat girl and this was a perfect place to go.  A friend brought me knowing how much I'd enjoy it.   We arrived just after 6 and got a table right away.  It was good timing because it filled up immediately after and they don't take reservations.    We split a small charcuterie board and it was such an amazing spread of meats.  Duck mousse was delicious.  MUST TRY the roasted bone marrow.  I was freezing cold and this warmed me right up.  Then ordered the suckling pig with turnips and sauteed dandelion leaves.  Simply prepared but the flavours were bursting.  Turnips were sweet which offset the dandelions.  The pork was crispy but juicy.  I was stuffed but very satisfied (even if I'm eating fruit and veggies for the rest of the weekend to make up for the amount of meat I had).  For what you get, it's good value for your money."}
{"text":"So what?  They cook bone marrow and serve it in the bone.  Interesting for Toronto? Yes however, everything else I could have purchased in better quality at any local market.   Considering all the hype; the food, service and dirty kitchen amount to \"how the heck does this place review so well!?\"   I guess anyone can open a restaurant that serves bone marrow in this city, and do well."}
{"text":"After reading so many reviews, i was nothing less than thrilled when my friend invited to join her and a few friends at the often tried and reviewed Black Hoof.    Arriving an hour late, after hopping on the subway, streetcar and shuttle bus, nothing was going to come in the way of my long awaited tasting of the infamous well talked about joint.  As i arrived, my party had already devoured the majority of the house cured meat platter which was comprised of various types of salami, prosciutto like pork, andouille sausage,and bone marrow.  Everything served on the wooden style platter was delicious, all the way down to the side of mustard.  Also saved for me was a creamy light whipped chicken liver served with a side of chives/parsley soaked in olive oil and a small slab of sweet confit.  As i was barely making a dent in what was saved for me, the waiter brought over our smoked meat tar tar served with a raw egg york on top.  This was served with some oven toasted crouton liked slices of bread.  The beef tartar had a delicious fresh herb flavour and a hint of ponzu sauce.  The whole concoction just melts in your mouth.  Few minutes later, the horse carpaccio was served with succulent thinly sliced mushroom and some arugula type greens.  The whole dish was drizzled with olive oil.  Next, came the pork belly filled perogies, served with a creamy sauce, some seaweed shavings, and some brown sugar on top.  They were very flavourful and tasty. Although I might have done ok without the creamy white sauce.  Although our stomachs were already getting filled (we had devoured three servings of bread), the waiter served us with what was called sweat bread.  It tasted a little like smoked peameal bacon. It was served over small sliced mini potatoes, a creamy sauce and some greens.  We were all wondering what it was made of but none of us knew. At the end of dinner, we asked our waiter what was in this mysterious dish, he said it was the calf's thymus gland.  Glad I didn't know before i ate it.  This was probably my least favorite dish of the evening. The bone marrow being my favorite (at $9, it doesn't disappoint), the meat platter my second favorite, and the beef tartar and horse carpaccio next, in that order. The perogies, then the sweat bread last.  By the end of the night, after much interesting and controversial conversation sitting in the outback patio, our stomachs were filled, our curiosity and appetities were satiated, and after an order of sangria, we were ready to head back home. The ambiance is certainly very cozy and low key.  The wait staff was attentitive and very polite.  The meal came to $157 plus tax and tip for 4.  My share was around $43 which is reasonable.  You would think given the size of the portion and the odd animal parts that are being served that some of the dishes must have pretty good margins.  Overall, i think everyone should atleast go to this restaurant once, unless you are vegetarian, in which case you only have two menu options - beets and sweet potatoes.    On my way out, i was surprised to see that there were only 3 people preparing food in what seemed to be a condo size kitchen.  They were cooking over a regular stove such as the one i have at home and with a regular frying pan.  Given that alot of the items are raw or pre-processed, there isn't as much cooking as you would expect from most restaurants.  They definitely created a menu that is unique, not for the faint of heart or those that fear anything that comes from parts of animals that isn't eaten in the mainstream. You definitely won't find the best cuts of meat in this joint such as striploin steak or rib eye.  One last mention is that they don't take credit cards there. To my relief, they do accept debit. I didn't bring alot of cash, I didn't think I had to since i wasn't going to Chinatown."}
{"text":"A friend of ours brought us there to eat and the food was delish! The place was quite small and the service was a little slow that night.  However, the food was great and the atmosphere too! I would def go back!"}
{"text":"The infamous Black Hoof is famous for the wait it takes to get a seat.  Table service and food is great - expect a mix of french bistro and really loud British pub vibe when you choose this place.  Prices were reasonable and the small but extensive menu was excellent.  First place in Northern America where I've seen horse tar tare...  Black pudding, brussel sprouts and scallops + oxtail were excellent.  The famous bone marrow was disappointingly sub-par.  Even with all the drunk screaming conversation on our left and the almost pitch black lighting, I could tell the bone marrow was still clear and even pink/red in parts.  Ummh, I ordered an entree/dish not a transplant here, ayh!  Compare that to fine dining establishments in San Francisco with bone marrow entrees and it goes without saying that I was disgusted.  The kitchen operations should get more resources to make bone marrow dishes right.  The hostess is a bit surly, but she'll get you seated in the fastest time possible.  Raw bar had such great ambiance and staff, we were tempted to stay there, but waited it out to try Black Hoof.  I'd pass on any further visits to BH.  The cocktail bar across the street had great service and ambiance, but smelled horrific.  We didn't take a cab to Dundas to pay to smell body funk simmering over a very nice french fireplace.  Don't go after a snowstorm - locals apparently don't bath/shower as often as Americans.  Second venue outside of a hotel convention where I witnessed this."}
{"text":"Raw food served on a platter of raw professionalism.   Black Hoof is a small joint with dim lights, running on an upscale vibe. The restaurant is divided into two separate buildings. The building to your left, called Black Hoof, serves you a la carte, while the building to your right, Hoof Raw Bar, caters you with quicker foods a la bar style.  We were escorted to our seat and handed a drink menu. The food menu is written on a chalk board and looked like it was written by E.T trying to learn human food. Ever hear of Nutella with liver? How about some roasted bone marrow? This is obviously a place you visit to test your taste buds and your curiosity.  They serve you shared dishes. We decided on the Tongue Briole, Heart tartare, Pork carnita tacos and the daily veg. The heart tartare tasted very diifferent, but was very well presented and flavorful. The tongue was akin to pulled pork sandwiched in sweet bread. The tacos were mini tacos garnished with various normal things. The salad came with raw tuna which was all very fresh and tasty. Each dish was brought to us by a very friendly and professional waiter that never looked rushed and was prompt with recommendations on how to eat the food.   This place gets bonus points for giving us free glasses of wine (our choice) and waiving the salad. We found a small peice of plastic inside one of our small tacos which led the manager to send us sincere apologies.   Would I go back? Maybe on a full stomach. The food was very flavorful and very well presented. But raw heart, is raw heart."}
{"text":"Knocked my socks off.    I had expected something unusual, but not something so sublime and sophisticated.  My mind was officially blown.  My two favorites: the fluke crudo and the foie & blood sausage.  These two things make me wish I lived in Toronto.  Definitely get the charcuterie plate, because even if it looks like your average charcuterie, it is anything but.  Blueberry bison sausage?  I pine for you.    Another thing, their cocktail menu should not go unnoticed.  I am a pretty discerning when it comes to a craft cocktail, and their mixologist has come up with some incredible stuff.  I would go there just for the drinks alone.  (Hoof Cafe across the street has outstanding drink menu as well.)  I miss it already."}
{"text":"Love this place! I would suggest picking 4-5 items from the menu and be blown away. We had Beef tongue and brioche, squid salad, and a few other dishes. He dishes were so beautiful and all the vegetables that they pickle is incredible. And very reasonably priced. FYI it gets busy real quick."}
{"text":"This place is great. Nothing more to add, just really like this spot."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overrated. The ambiance is great with a nice patio at  the back. However, the food is mediocre at best. The cold-cut cured meat all tastes the same. The horse carpaccio (the meat itself) is tasteless and not recommended. The price is quite excessive for the amount and quality of food. I ordered a glass of coke which cost $3 - normally you would have expected a free refill for a glass filled with ice. However, they ended up charging me for two cokes. I won't recommend this place.   If you really want to enjoy some good quality cured meat, go to Salty Pig in Boston."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Toronto! The food is delicious, original, and of the highest quality!I don't think I can say anything that hasn't been said about how wonderful this restaurant is!"}
{"text":"I waited a long time to try this place.. And wow did it live up to the hype.   Everything was delicious!    Highly recommend and would absolutely go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good food.  Nice environment, decent staff. You have to stop in, put in your name and they will call you to come when the table is ready-there are pubs near which is good!  I've been there 3 times and I like the place.  The tacos are great!"}
{"text":"Just throwing my name on the pile. What else needs to be said about this place?  Oh, I like to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"First timmer... Love it. Great food excellent staff. Bone marrow is a must. The drinks are alright. Wil be going back with some new friends."}
{"text":"Their menu is ever changing and very creative!  Each dish is balanced and executed well.  No matter how they make fois gras, it is amazing!"}
{"text":"I like what they are doing here.  The \"outdoor\" patio is a wooden shed with open windows and had a really nice ambience.  The food was innovative and worked well.  I've been to lots of restaurants like this, and I was glad that the dishes stood on their own.  I liked to see their interesting ingredients - the horse tartare and blood custard were my two favorites.  Would have liked to see some more vegetables on the menu besides the few sprigs of garnish.  I can just imagine how good the chef can make vegetables taste."}
{"text":"Some of the best dishes were the bone marrow, the foie gras french toast, and the cheese board. It had great ambience and amazing food. The service was great and the food came fast. I would definitely come here again. The only downside was the price and limited menu but what more can you expect from a fancy gastro pub?"}
{"text":"Blac hoof hasn't lost its touch. Everything, from the cocktails to the mains to the desserts, was A1. Service was very attentionate. If it wasn't for the wait (and calories) I'd eat there every week."}
{"text":"I love the creativity in their food!  Delicious, I still think about it from time to time!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and it's always good to see the same knowledgeable staff working. The food is unreal and unique for this city. Can't go wrong with some bone marrow and beef hearts ;) cocktails are actually really yum as well. If you want to try something different, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Huge disappointment when you won't let a patron wait inside with 15 minutes to open.  Especially when all the doors are open and you just paid a taxi 15 bucks to get there.  The icing on the cake was when they told me that they don't take credit cards.  Fore Warning: only Cash and CAN Debit Cards."}
{"text":"Despite all of the foodie hype surrounding this place over the past few years, I had always procrastinated on going because the Hoof's small size and no-reservations policy makes it difficult to get in. Sure I had braved long waits at Libretto, Terroni, Guu and other no-reso places before, but somehow whenever the possibility of Black Hoof came up I always got irrationally gun shy.  So when my wife offered to take me here for my birthday I did the safe (and lame) thing and chose to go on a Sunday evening at 6 pm (right as it opens).   Well let's just say that I'm glad I went because I had one of the best meals that I've had all year.  To start the meal we (four of us) ordered the charcuterie plate and the smoked beef tartare to share.  The charcuterie was as good as it gets and was certainly the best in the city (better than Local Kitchen and Wine Bar and Buca, both of which are also very good). The highlights were the horse mortadella, the bison and blueberry sausage, and the wild boar sausage. The tartare was also excellent, with the smoke being very subtle and the beef being very fresh and nicely beefy.  For our mains we had two orders of the duck tagliatelle, one order of the beef heart and scallops, and the beef tongue on brioche (which was my order).   There were no misses in the entire bunch and each dish was so good that it was hard for me to begin picking favourites.   1) The duck tagliatelle. Where do I start? This is the best pasta dish I had all year. The pasta itself was beautiful, with succulent duck meat mixing deliciously with creamy egg and sharp parmesan. There was also some type of dried current used in the sauce which gave it a very mild sweetness.   2) The tongue sandwich. I was a little nervous when I ordered this as I somehow envisioned that I would be served a slobbery grey beef tongue slapped half-assedly on a plate. What I actually got was a gourmet take on an open faced pastrami sandwich. The meat was thin sliced and the bread was lightly toasted brioche. Flavour-wise it was also similar to pastrami albeit slightly less salty and with more depth. The black sweet mustard and pickled celery that accompanied it were perfection.  3) The beef heart and scallops.  This is the dish I tried the least but it was also really great. At the end of the day what's not to like about tender, medium-rare beef heart meeting the rich sweet flavour of scallops.   Also of note is the fact that Black Hoof has developed a fairly strong reputation for its short but interesting cocktail menu (which is divided into white and brown cocktails). The Manhattan I ordered was smooth and interesting with just the right balance of bitters (which were made in-house). There was also a solid wine list, with some good deals on \"bin ends\" and  there were also some good beers on tap (including my new favourite, Beau's Lug Tread).  Another cool (and possibly gimmicky) tidbit about this restaurant is the fact that all of the cooking is done on an electric stove that really looks no different than what most people would have at home.   So what more can I say. This place was great and would be worth waiting for a few hours for (especially because you can flip them your cell number and wander down the block for a beer). I give it a 5 and would recommend it to anyone.  Well, almost anyone. As a final and and fairly obvious sidenote, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to unadventurous eaters although there are a few safer choices on the menu (such as the duck tagliatelle, and the carnitas).   Also, do not, under any circumstances take vegetarians here, unless they want to sit glumly eating bread all night as they watch their carnivorous table-mates make primal grunts while trying not to break into the meat-sweats.   Everyone else, go to Black Hoof."}
{"text":"Man, I didn't think I'd like this place as much as everyone else, but it's true, this place is great. Admittedly, I was more cautious than I would have liked, ordering only the charcuterie and the fromage plate, but they were both fantastic and the drinks were to die for. Mmmmanhanttans! Looking forward to horse sammy and more cheese next time."}
{"text":"This place has been on the top of my list to try out and I got the chance recently to try the ever so hyped restaurant in the country (I think they were voted one of the top best new restaurants in Canada). After reading a lot of the reviews I thought the meats would be really really gamey but I didn't find that at all. Their menu was pretty short and simple which made it easy with the options...we tried the following:  Horse Meat  Tongue Brioche Large Charcuterie Lamb Belly  All were excellent, the Charcuterie seem to be the norm on the night I had went and it was a great way to sample a great variety of meats and pate. The lamb belly was excellent as it was very flavorful. The horse meat I found just ok, they make it in a style like a tartar so it was very hard to distinguish the actual taste of horse meat. The Tongue brioche was by far the best, you would expect tongue to be tough and gamey but it was very soft and succulent. Almost reminded us of really fatty Montreal smoked meat.  Overall the experience was worth it, it's not a place I would go every week but a place I would hit up every now and then to get my taste buds going. I will definitely be back to try the brunch at Hoof Cafe."}
{"text":"great spot.  sat at the bar on a sunday evening and the place was packed.  had the duck confit sammy.  unreal, a must get.  friendly service and good music.  my only very minor complaint is that it gets a little smokey, and you can wind up smelling a little like the food.  won't stop me from returning multiple times though."}
{"text":"I'm going to add my voice to the cacophony of praise for the Black Hoof. I was visiting a friend in Newmarket and we decided to go try something different in Toronto for dinner on a Saturday. Yelp directed me to the very highly reviewed Black Hoof.   We had hoped to make it there for opening at 6 pm, but because of some construction on the subway lines we arrived at 6:20 and it was already full. They only seat about 30 people. I think they could benefit from a larger location, the staff seemed to be practically tripping over one another.   They sent us across the street to wait in their cocktail bar (which also served some pretty fantastic duck wings). It was probably about an hour and a half wait before we got our call. Was it worth it? Well, I certainly would've preferred less of a wait but the meal was so spectacular I'd do it again.  We ordered the bone marrow, cured meats, horse tartare and tongue on brioche. I was totally blown away by the marrow and the tongue. The tongue is good enough to rival Schwartz's smoked meat sandwiches in Montreal. The marrow was such an original menu item, I had no idea what I've been missing out on all these years. I'm looking forward to attempting it at home.   The cured meats were pretty good, but it was a lot to share between just two people. I passed on the horse tartare, but my friend ate it all, so I must've been good.   As a side note, the foie and nutella dish sounds like a really bizarre pairing to me, but my friend said that everything they made was so well, he'd be willing to try anything they put down in front of him."}
{"text":"A meat lovers dream! The bone marrow is to die for and I've been back twice to indulge in this alone. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and the service is excellent. The house made drinks at the Hoof and across the street are so good! Run...don't walk to Black Hoof. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"Cocktails were great while the service and food struggled.  We ordered the tartare which didn't come with a way to eat it. A log of meat, used something like dry rice or broken marbles to add crunch. I'd have preferred a wafer. The beer was accepting but slow. The olives came with pits in a plate of oil, I'm sure the jar was freshly opened.   Expensive, poor quality and cramped."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful time at the Black Hoof. It's a date spot and for anyone that loves meat. I had a dream I took a vegetarian here and they thought everything was soy. Ha!  This is what i ordered:  Roasted Bone Marrow Smoke sweetbread Tongue on brioche Horse tartare Calf brain Foie gras  I ordered one more item but forgot what it was. I did enjoy all the meals but I wasn't a huge fan of the horse tartare. It was good but not great. We had to wait 30 minutes which we went across to the street. Listen people, grab a cocktail there, there're all great cocktails! No voka shit here. Jenn makes killer zingers and it's a fantastic start to the dead animals you will be having.  I must admire I drank way too much and my taste pallets must have been shot. I must go back here sober."}
{"text":"Black Hoof - totally amazing tapas style dishes with great flavor in each dish. The tongue sandwich, bone merrow are a must try!!! The menu are posted to the wall at the patio, and very simple with great choices. We almost ordered the whole menu slowly with addition one after another because of the great taste!!! Just bring enough cash since that's the only method to pay =)"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a treat! Some really great and unique menu items. Perhaps not all of it is for the faint of heart, but I promise even the squeamish could find something great to eat!   I ate with a group of 6 which was perfect, because we were able to try nearly everything on the menu! We started with the charcuterie platter, which was a great little tasting for each of us, but perhaps shared better with 4 people; and the bone marrow which was also small, but a rich, buttery goodness you might not want to eat more of anyhow!  Out of everything, I have to say the cow's tongue pastrami was my favourite, my first time having tongue, and I was pleasantly surprised, I could definitely eat it on a sandwich every day. The brain, ricotta and artichoke ravioli took a close second, the sauce was the perfect mix of acidity to savoury, but to be honest, you'd never know there was brain involved. The sweetbreads also packed a lot of flavour, and the blood custard was almost desert-like with shaved pear and candied onions, it didn't leave a blood-like aftertaste at all, I would definitely order it again.   The cocktails here are definitely worth the $12 price tag, you have to try one! There's an entire shelf of house made concoctions, bitters and pickled garnishes in beautiful mason jars, the bartender really knows what she's doing. I had what was called the \"gypsy woman,\" I don't tend to like sweet drinks, I usually stick to beer, but this drink was amazing and I could have had many; dangerously good."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best meals I've ever had! Everything was cooked to perfection, wonderful explosions of flavour in you mouth ! The foie and waffle was my favourite dish but literally everything we order was wonderful"}
{"text":"If you're reading reviews to figure out if black hoof is the restaurant you're going to try tonight, trust me, it is definitely worth going to.  Had bone marrow, blood sausage and scallops, some sort of oxtail pasta and their dessert of the day which was a homestyle butter tart in a strudel pastry with maple syrup and bits of toffee topped with pistachio ice cream. Unreal meal.   Plates are good for sharing and it's best to get 4-6... The couple beside us started with the charcuterie (a beautiful assortment of meats and cheeses) which I was a little jealous about... But I'll be back. Overall good vibes, wait staff were really cool and kept refilling our water (first time I didn't have to ask for more water at a restaurant), music was good and didn't wait long for our food.   Will recommend to all and will definitely return. It was so... So, so, good."}
{"text":"One word and one word only: Charcuterie.   Great food, great vibe, busy as hell and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Second time at Black Hoof.  All dishes were made to share but, I didn't really want to...was so delicious. Went for a first date and when I go again...I think I can forego the \"taste better when you share\" mentality. I WANT IT ALL (j/k...not really). Atmosphere was great sans the three pirates sitting next to us. Who knew the f-bomb could be used as a verb, adverb, adjective, noun...  Bone marrow - a carnivore's dream.  Lamb tartare with ash - who knew dutty meat could taste so good. Guessing if I smeared my protein in a fireplace, it will not yield the same result. Some shrimp ceviche with sweetbreads - I had to google sweatbreads the first time I tried this. Thymus...pancreas...I guess anything fried tastes heavenly."}
{"text":"After ordering, it was a long wait for small portions. I didn't like the taste of any of the items we ordered.  Nice decor and vibe. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place.  I haven't had a bad experience yet.  Everything on the menu is great especially the bone marrow.  The in house cured meats were all great, especially the duck prosciutto, horse bresaola and wild boar salami.  Very nice atmosphere and a good wine selection."}
{"text":"This is a 3.5 star review.  We arrived on a Friday night, around 6:15pm, it was pretty empty.   We were a party of 2, and we were seated immediately.  I think by 7 pm they were completely full though.  The venue is nice, they have a covered patio in the back which is where we sat.  Its a bit stuffy in the summer.  I don't think sitting inside would have been any better since they weren't running any air-con.  Its like tapas, and you order a few dishes per person to share.  Ordered:  Roasted Bone Marrow (4/5): $8, this was one of my favorite dishes.  It comes with bread, and is to be eaten as a spread.  Doesn't need the salt it comes with.  Serves 2-3 people.  Spicy Horse Tartare (4/5): $16, also a really good dish.  The horse meat is very mild, tastes similar to beef.  Served with hollandaise sauce and hickory sticks, its a surprising good combo.  Its a refreshing dish, order it. Serves 2-4 people.  Tongue on Brioche (3/5): $14.  This dish has a huge portion of meat.  Its similar to a corn beef sandwich.  Its good, but its bests shared between 4+ people.    Beef Heart and Mussels (2/5): $15.  I didn't really enjoy this dish much at all.  The heart is really spongy/chewy.  And its a really strong flavor.   Comes with 4 mussels which are just ok.  Its a large portion of meat, best shared between 4+ people.   Service: Very good.  Water was constantly refilled.  When the food was brought to us, each part of the dish was explained (only one server dish this though, wish both of them did this).  Plates/cutlery  were changed a couple times throughout the service.  Good meal overall."}
{"text":"I came here with two of my other friends to enjoy a late night dinner. After hearing so many great things about this place and about all the unique dishes they offer, I wanted to check it out.  We ordered the bone marrow, tongue sandwich, paté, and horse tartar and the cured meat and cheese platter.  I enjoyed them all, though I must say one of my friend who is not so adventurous when it comes to food, didn't enjoy the experience as much as I did (my second friend enjoyed it as well).  I especially liked their paté.  I would recommend it to all those looking to try some unique dishes."}
{"text":"Wish the waits aren't as long. Love the charcuterie platter and how it changes every few months. While some items like the bone marrow are main stays, the menu generally changes every few months which I appreciate.  The Tongue on Brioche is to die for!"}
{"text":"This was a unique treat and in a great little spot downtown."}
{"text":"Meat lover please dont miss this!!!!!  My favorite: bone marrow & Charcuterie!"}
{"text":"Charcuterie.  Tongue sandwich.  Roasted bone marrow.  Not for picky eaters, but if you like meat and adventure, this is for you.  Absolute perfection."}
{"text":"I am spoiled. Truly spoiled. I guess at least, as I have yet to be blown away by Black Hoof. It IS good. And the cocktails are good, the pickled things are good and the service is good. However, I just do not know. Bestellen has better charcuterie (dare I say it). And maybe I get my fill of really good offal every time I visit Montreal. Either way, its great.... but it just does not live up to the hype - the fever pitch of hype. Minus a star for no reservations or visa. I hate waiting in line and remembering cash.  3.5"}
{"text":"One of the best charcuterie plates in Toronto. And the marrow is to die for. Last time I was there, it was sold out (at 7pm wtf), but it's like eating butter from heaven.   If I was on death row, the marrow would be one of my last meals. Period."}
{"text":"Big points for atmosphere if you like trendy and lively spots normally.  The food however for the most part was unimpressive.  The Charcuterie was a really large portion fit for 4 as an appy.  Would go back to work my way more thoroughly through the menu to find some starts."}
{"text":"Every time this place gives you something different but with the same high quality and attention to details. You will never get bored dining here."}
{"text":"I dined at The Black Hoof last month as part of a 'five dinners in seven hours' food safari around Toronto. The popular charcuterie bistro has built up a formidable reputation among locals since opening in 2008 and was deemed a must-eat by everyone we encountered. The reason? Chef Greg Van Gameren smokes and cures his own meats and offers everything from rabbit rillettes with cinnamon and nutmeg to elk salami to horse tartare. Yes, the exoticness of the protein was a tad frightening at first but where else would I find anything like this?! Besides, I couldn't think of a better way to cap off our restaurant crawl than by enjoying cold deli cuts.  We order the charcuterie platter of eight items and wait with bated breath to see what the chef will serve us. The menu changes daily, depending on availability, and you don't really know what you'll get until it arrives at your table. Five minutes later, we are presented with a slender wooden platter that features such a wide range of red hues, it should act as an inspiration for L'Oreal's next lipstick range. Today's selection includes a delectable-looking foie gras parfait with whipped butter, curious-sounding buffalo and blueberry salami slices, fennel pollen salami slices; black truffled salami slices; smoked summer spicy sausage and lardo horse mortadella. We are instructed to make our way from one end of the board (milder tasting cuts) to the other end (the horse mortadella) and are left to our own devices. Spurred on by the momentous occasion and my curiosity, I decide to have a bite of at least each cold cut, including *gasp* the horse mortadella! For the record, it didn't taste like chicken. I can't actually describe what it tasted like but let's just say it wasn't one of my favorites. The truffled salami, however, was simply spectacular. Other notable mentions must be given to the subtly sweet buffalo and blueberry salami and the intriguing-tasting fennel pollen salami. A small bowl of pickled cauliflower, onions, daikon and carrots also accompany the platter but I was so full, I didn't even sample any of it.

{"text":"Pretty awesome meals. A little too much fat in one sitting but it's worth it. My fav would be the liver and onions, beef heart tartare and foie and nutella. The portions are quite generous too. Great atmosphere. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Think a tongue sandwich sounds gross? Think again.  This place changed the way I think about food.  Their small plates are excellent for sharing.  The prices are reasonable and the cocktails are sensational.  Absolutely a favorite spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"Meat, meat and more meat. That's all I can say...but I must say more - It was almost 2 weeks ago that I went to the Black Hoof for the  first time, and my buddy and I can't stop talking about it. The menu is a menagerie of the nasty bits and the tasty morsels of animal parts. Finally a Toronto Chef (Grant van Gameren) is paying homage to meat part misfits and their use for genuine cooking creativity.   Immediately we sat down and ordered a nice bottle of red to help us balance out the savories, saltiness and the proteins that we were expecting to encounter during the meal.   And so it begins...We devoured the charcuterie as an appetizer - our knowledgeable and reliable waitress broke down the contents of the plate, but once she finished we soon lost track of what we were eating as our carnivorous spirits attacked the numerous terrines, prosciutto, duck sausage, and various other cured and magical meat creations.   After that we were greeted by the Roasted Bone Marrow - spoon fulls of buttery gelatinous deliciousness were gently placed on toasted Thuet bread than sprinkled with sea salt. I swear at this point our waitress should have begun encircling the table with yellow police tape, as any unfortunate passerby that got caught in the glutinous rampage could have lost an appendage or 2.   Finally, for desert we enjoyed the social equalizer of dishes - foie gras over blood sausage - a smooth, sweet and salty experience like nothing I've had before - it was peasant food with a kiss of ultra luxury. This take on foie gras makes me forget it's the most over used and extravagant ingredient in high end restaurants and reminds me once again why it is so beholden to the chefs who wield it in their kitchens.    The Black Hoof Cafe is a great foray for many people into the peasant food and the local food movement that is taking place in North America. It's time to try something different than a standard cut of beef or pork. Maybe some brains or sweetbreads tonight? Cheers!"}
{"text":"All the reviews are spot on, so I'm not going to get into the details about the food. Let me just recommend that you show up at least 10 mins before opening (6pm)... and chances are you'll get a seat to eat right away. That was my tactic and I got the last table with my uber-foodie aunt and uncle from NYC."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food!!! It was a continuous pleasure, like having multiple foodgasms!!  The only reason I give it 4 is because their service does NOT live up to the food :("}
{"text":"Every true Toronto Yelper needs to go to the BH. And Mystic Muffin.  Almost always packed, best bet is to come at a weird hour- don't hesitate to sit at the bar, its got even better service than tables. The place is converted from an old Portuguese man sports-snack bar, and because they didn't do much in terms of conversion it has a similar set up - and the absence of a gas line.   They do all their cooking on what looks like your mom's first white Whirlpool stove/oven combo. It's nothing fancy. What's crazy is what they can do with that thing. The entire preparation area is right behind the bar so you can watch them do their magic- all in about 25 narrow sq feet.  Tried a bunch of dishes with Tonja B., but the one that is still standing out is the duck confit. I could have ordered it three times and had only that- I'd still have been more than satisfied.   The other dishes were all interesting- (beef tartar tasted like delicious smoked meat from Montreal)  the only one I'd skip next time was the smoked herring. A little too sashimi-ish.   Bonus: They have $4.50 bottles of Labatt 50. Sooooooooooooooo Ossington/Dundas."}

{"text":"Been about a year since I've been at Black Hoof. The food and experience still sticks in my mind as AMAZING so decided it's worthy of posting! My husband and I felt adventurous so tried this place out with some hesitation.  The food was amazing. We had the bone marrow, which was super rich and yummy. We also went for a charcuterie (in hindsight, we should've opted for something more unique). What sticks in my mind still after over a year is the scallops on an oxtail nugget thing. It was sooooo yummy. After dinner, we jumped across the street to their sister cocktail bar. There's such an awesome vibe in that place. It's very tiny so have a plan B if you don't get a seat."}
{"text":"Very nice place Would like to go there alone Next time I will take a taxi"}
{"text":"Stars of the show:   + Roasted Bone Marrow--this one is finger licking good.  Scrape some bone marrow on a piece of toasted bread and sprinkle sea salt on it.  Sea salt brings out the richness of the bone marrow.  It's truly amazing!  + Foie Gras Mousse was heavenly.  All year I got sick of seeing Foie Gras on many menus across town.  This one changed everything.  It was smooth like butter, savory and creamy.  The best Foie Gras I have ever tasted!  + Foraged Mushroom with Duck Heart.  The chewiness of the duck heart and the soft sponginess of the mushrooms made this dish stood out for me.  I love that it was lightly seasoned with salt and olive oil, allowing the two main ingredients' flavor to come through.  Yummy!  + Raw Horse Sammy was interesting and delicious.  The fresh, delicate and juicy tartare melted as soon as it hit my tongue.  The onion and hot sauce, in my opinion, made the dish special.  Black Hoof is the kind of place you go with a group of good friends.  Or in my case, the perfect place to meet my new Yelp friends for the first time.    The decor and ambience, were in keeping with the food, rustic but upscale.  Service was stellar, despite the lineup the wait staff didn't try to rush us out.  I'm giving Black Hoof the top honor for its unique menu items, the quality of everything presented and the overall service."}
{"text":"Hard to find and a little out of the way. The people that come here did not suddenly decide to stroll in - the trips here must be planned.  When we walked in, the restaurant was empty except for the chefs and servers. I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. We're the kind of people that are a party of two but like to sit next to each other in a restaurant as opposed to across. I know it can be really annoying. But despite the fact that there was no one there, he placed us at a little table wedged between two empty tables. He explained that they have a random rushes at this time of night. Understandable, so we went about our merry way on this gastropub journey. We ordered:  - Bone Marrow  I think this was my boyfriend's favourite of the night. Melt-in-your-mouth and reminiscent of butter with a slight hint of meatiness.  - Horse Tartare My favourite of the night. We were both kinda nervous (which I think is supposed to add to the novelty) and considered not ordering it. But it was pretty good! Tender, not insanely gamey and just the right amount of \"wait, this isn't beef.\"  I would order it again in a heartbeat.  - Charcuterie Board Mixed reviews. The schmaltz was the most memorable in the good way. The not so good way was the cow heart with dill. I think it could have done without the dill. I'm a fan of sweetbreads and the more unconventional cuts of meat but that was a frown-inducing taste. I like how they include chorizo on the board too, because who doesn't love chorizo?  Halfway through the meal, our server eventually combined a table next to us so we could be reunited at last - how we survived so long apart I'll never know (I'm kidding). I appreciate the gesture but the predicted rush never came, save for another couple that walked in. Slightly pretentious and hipster, but I don't doubt that these are really nice people. If we ever make the trek back, I think maybe we'll try the brains."}
{"text":"If you enjoy meat and are just a little adventurous, go here. Now.   I have been here twice and have been thoroughly impressed both times. I will start by reviewing each of the items I have tried.  Pork carnitas tacos - Similar to what you might get at a good Mexican restaurant. Nothing special but certainly worth a try.  Bone marrow - The method of serving this dish makes ordering it worthwhile. They slice open a bone and serve you one half of it. A little bit of marrow on a serving of their wonderful brioche is an incredible way to start your meal.  Tongue on brioche - When I first ate this, I thought I was eating a smoked meat sandwich. I could not believe it was tongue. This is a very rich dish and it should definitely be shared.  Ravioli with brains - There was no way to know you were eating brains and the ravioli was nothing special. The only dish I would suggest you skip  Charcuterie plate - Fantastic. Perfect variety of meats to start off a meal. Pork belly in broth - I had never had pork belly before this meal but I have a feeling I will struggle to ever top this. It had a perfect combination of rich fattiness with a nice crispy crust.  Sweetbreads - When you first find out that sweetbreads are thymus glands, you may be reluctant to try it. Don't. This is in my list of top three things I have ever eaten. It is hard to put into words how good these are.   In addition to the excellent food, the service is fantastic. Attentive without being overbearing.   Just go."}
{"text":"Quite a unique menu offering horse tartar, beef tongue pastrami, sweetbreads and others accompanied by tasty cocktails. (Only six house recipes, but was informed that they offer all the classics off menu)  My friend was put off by horse on the menu. So maybe not for unadventurous eaters."}
{"text":"Went to Black Hoof with my girlfriend after reading articles about how the charcuterie was the best in Toronto. Left displeased. Service was ok, not great. We noticed a few people came in after us and they were attended to before we were. We waited for drinks for 10+ minutes. Charcuterie was okay, nothing to write home about. Bread was mediocre, charged extra and they gave us a limited amount. Did not even provide butter. There are definitely way better places in Toronto. Scallops and fennel was absolutely disgusting. It looked like bile and there was barely a hint of seafood/scallop. Rapini and figs were not to my liking, I found the figs quite bland however my girlfriend enjoyed them. The bill would have been reasonable if the food was not as mediocre as it was. Steer clear."}
{"text":"You really need to keep your eyes peeled for this place because like any certified hipster joint, it's almost invisible and is located in a very unassuming part of the street on dundas west, far from the hustle and bustle of the downtown core.  My bf and I had reservations, which was a good thing since this place seemed to be immediately packed upon opening at 6pm.  We didn't have a food menu but a drink menu instead, since the specials were written on a chalkboard on the wall for all to see (or try to see).   Being in an adventurous mood since this place really isn't for the faint of heart when beef heart is a menu option, we decided to get the following:  1. Charcuterie with bread (bread is extra) - tasty, all in all this was a decent charcuterie dish.  I wish they did not charge extra for bread since isn't that a given when you eat charcuterie?  Good way to get people to pay up for salty meats.  2. Bone marrow (market price of $9) - my favourite of the night, I am always a fan of bone marrow and the pieces we got were very succulent and filled to the brim with marrow.  3. Chochinita pibil tacos - aka 'pig tacos', which I did not find appetizing at all.  Actually I think the pork meat tasted a little TOO sour...as in, the meat may not have been fresh.  I took one bite of it and put it down.  My bf finished the all the tacos because he found them okay.  4. Pig blood parpardelle - this was one tasty pasta dish, my bf absolutely loved it.  The pig blood really added a springy taste so the pasts seemed more 'chewy' than usual, and flavour was good...none of that after-taste of pig blood, like the type you get when you cook pig blood cubes with soup.  5. Tongue on brioche - meh, I was too full by this time to eat this, so my bf packed it and ate it for lunch the next day.  Nothing to rave about.  Also, this may just be an unfortunate coincidence (or maybe the sour pork meat), but I started feeling sick that same night around bedtime.  The next day, I felt tired, had a general feeling of malaise and even a slight fever - this has never happened before, since it seemed to have come on suddently.  My bf felt fine, so either I had a bad reaction to one of the meats, or I had indeed suffered a mild form of food poisoning.  Thankfully, I was competely normal again the day afterwards.  I will not be coming back to this place, I think it was worth a try but not after that novelty wears off, there are other better food places to go."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Black Hoof Cuisine: Tapas Location: Little Italy Address: 928 Dundas St W Price Range: $10~15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 5 Service: 3 Ambiance: 3 Overall: 4  Extra information:  *Tapas (sharing plate) style *Specialize in exotic dishes  I love to try things that aren't very popular with many people. Was I hesistant the first time I tried chicken feet? Of course! those toes freaked the living crap out of me. But did I enjoy it? YES I did! How about the chicken heart skewer? It was alright (prob wouldn't eat it again) but I am glad I tried it. But how will you know if you will like something or not if you haven't tried it?  So when I first saw Black Hoof going up and down on the #1 ranking of popular restaurant list-  and saw that they served horsemeat sandwich, I just had to try it. It was on my list for awhile but never got the chance to visit because my family isn't really into charcuterie plates, foie gras and nonetheless- horsemeat.  But thankfully Jess from wherejessate wanted to check out the restaurant as well, so off I went on a foodie meetup dinner.  From reading many reviews, I was scared we would have to wait long to get tables. But thankfully, we were seated the moment we got there (much appreciated since it was cold that night).  Ordered: HOUSE CURED MEATS 5/5 *6 different types of cured meat (made in house) for $18 *This is a huge charcuterie plate, good to share between 2-4 people *Served with bread on the side *Can't remember what they were exactly but they change all the time *My favorite was the duck prosciutto *Duck prosciutto was smoky yet rich in flavor *Saltiness of the meat was perfect paired with the bread *This is THE best charcuterie plate I've ever had *Must order when you visit the Black Hoof  Ordered: FOIE PARFAIT 5/5 *Foie gras served in parfait style (creme) for $13 *This was served with some kind sweet fruit compote (blueberry?) *Overall very creamy and rich *Sometimes I find foie gras can have this distinct smell *This didn't have any specific smell, it was overall very smooth *Went very well with the sauce on the side *Big portion for foie gras *Very good for what you pay *Would order this again  Ordered: TONGUE ON BRIOCHE 5/5 *Thinly shaved tongue between 2 pieces of bread served with pickled celery for $14 *It was my first time having tongue like this (only had it grilled/boiled) *Tongue is shaved very thinly and it just melts in your mouth *Brioche is super soft and goes very well with the tongue and the sauce *Terragon mayo adds sweetness to the sandwich *Perfectly seasoned overall and it's just a very good sandwich  Ordered: BONE MARROW 2/5 *Piece of bone marrow served with toasted bread and chimichurri/salt for $9 *This was my first time trying bone marrow *Wasn't sure what to expect or how to eat it because I've only seen the pictures in reviews *Basically you are scrapping the fat inside the bones and eating them with the bread *I didn't like this very much *Wasn't sure what I was suppose to taste or enjoy *This will def take some time getting used to *I just felt like I was eating grease  Summary: I really enjoyed the dishes at the Black Hoof. They serve items that aren't easy to find and I really appreciate restaurants like that. However, if you didn't notice this already, I would like to kindly point out that there won't be much for you to eat there if you are a vegetarian. Black Hoof is a restaurant for true carnivores, those that gets bored with chewing on a pieces of rare steak and seeks more for exotic parts/cuts of animals. I am def going back!  +Sadly, horse meat sandwich was no longer avail on menu (so sad)"}
{"text":"This is a must try in Toronto! We were visiting our friends in Toronto and they took us here. We had our first Horse Tartare and it was very good! Tasted like beef but just a tad chewier. My favorite was the dessert, Foie Gras with Nutella. It was amazing! Everything on the menu was pretty good. We also had Bone Marrow, which I had for the first time as well. I thought it would be more expensive, but for $8, the bone was quite big and we were able to share among the 6 of us.  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Black Hoof is exquisite but not pretentious. The menu has a vast array of unique and mouth-watering dishes, most of which I tried for the first time at this place. Some of my favourites are: tongue on brioche, bone marrow, the pâté and the sticky toffee pudding. The cocktails are elegant and complex, infused with delicious aromas and flavours. Being able to see the old school kitchen where the magic happens...that's just a bonus. Don't think twice, make sure you stop in."}
{"text":"Make reservations or be prepared to wait. This place is popular!  Food and drinks here are really good, definitely try the bone marrow, be sure to get some extra bread with it (although I think they will charge you for it, I remember it not coming with the charcuterie).  Because of that this is not a place if you're looking for a good deal. But if you're willing to spend, this is a must try spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"WOW!  Just got home from dinner here. We're backpacking around North America, so spending money hurts, but Black Hoof was TOTALLY worth it.   We had the bone marrow ($9), the smoked beef tartare ($16) and the pork & scallops ($19). The bone marrow was out of this world amazing (although I had to try and trick my mind into not thinking about the fat content - brain was enjoying the food as much as me so didn't care). It came with toasts, salt, and chimichurri. The smoked beef tartare came with gorgeous toasts with chopped parsley, a duck egg glaze and grated fresh horseradish. Very, very nice. I hate to say it, but the pork and scallops kind of let the team down. It was a nice dish, but small, and unfortunately we both agreed that the scallops were overdone. Not fatally overdone, but overdone. In another restaurant we might've raved, but after the other two dishes it was a bit of a let down. Not enough to bring the rating down though!  The drinks menu was also great. I had a glass of the gamay (delicious) and a Kentucky vs Morrocco cocktail (delicious). Hubby had some kind of beer (beery) and a barbera (delicious) and a Manhattan (amazing delicious!).  If we lived in Toronto this is exactly the sort of place where all our disposable cash would disappear. Totally recommend - especially if you're willing to extend yourself food-wise. I want to go back and try everything else!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to visit while in Toronto for an interview. If you love meat, it is a right place for you. The meat tastes really yammy.  I drop 1 star cuz the service could be faster."}
{"text":"Overall- 4.5/5, so it's really good. Since we are Canada, and I'm a hockey fan, I'm giving out my top three stars.... #1- the food; horse tartar- great texture, and once ya get past eating a prancing beast, it's yummy; the califlower/siracha/cheetoos was amazing; charceuterie was a nice mix of meats, oxtail and scallops was also good (a smidge overcooked on the scallops, but good nonetheless) #2- oddly enough, even though the food is awesome, the wine selection is even better. It's tight, with a focus on Spanish/Italian/French wines, and you seriously can't pick the wrong glass (my wife and I share 5 different glasses; the syrah/garnacha is the bomb, and a bottle is definitely worth it). #3- the people; after 4 years of snobby east coasters in the US, it's so nice to actually talk to the people next to you and share stories/experiences. The owner actually come over and played with our 6 month old baby, and gave us recommendations on favorite local places. Great food, great wine, fun/nice peeps. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Some of the things I had here may not still be on the menu. We were seated at the bar; it's tight but lets you sit closer to your chums and get really acquainted. The \"kitchen\" was right in front of our faces and we could feel the heat from the dishes being cooked. This was the place where I had Bone Marrow for the first time. It was interesting, and I wish I could take home the bone and use it as a coffee table centerpiece or something. Horse Tartare was actually very delicious, but I'm wondering if it was just overload of salt and spices that masked its true taste. Charcuterie board was also a delight to look at as much as it was to consume. It's an eccentric menu, that's for sure. There's foie and nutella (!) but I didn't try it. Maybe next time. Service was also prompt and very sweet, but I probably would return at a 'less busy' time (if there is one) and get seated at a table."}
{"text":"Had the cassoulet.  It looked like a tiny serving but was (a) delicious, (b) more than filling enough."}
{"text":"Food was really good but portions can be tiny. Be prepared to spend a lot but it really is delicious."}
{"text":"Overall an amazing experience. My boyfriend and I waited over an hour to get a spot at the bar but definitely well worth the wait! Very unique selection of beers and wines, almost adventurous I would say.  We started with the Charcuterie and it was wonderful. Right down to the dipping sauces. I'm usually not a huge fan of cold cut or smoked meat, but this was really good. Our server took the time to describe in detail the names of each meat as well as what the sauce was made out of.   Next was the bone marrow which came with quite the chunk of marrow. Very tasty with the sea salt. Perfectly cooked, just soft enough to really taste the flavours. We also got the pork carnitas tacos which basically reminded me of those pork buns that are the new asian restaurant fad (ie. Swish by Han, Momofuku Noodle Bar). Nonetheless, I guess you really can't go wrong making this dish.  Our last dish was Oxtail and Scallops. We probably should have started with this dish. It was huge. A nice portion of ox tail with a delicate sauce. We couldn't finish it but not because it was not good! Don't be fooled by smaller tapas dishes! It adds up, plus with the bread and all it was quite the dinner.  Great friendly service. As a ex server myself I can appreciate quality service. Our server was very patient with our questions. She also knew the menu quite thoroughly which was a big plus. Never felt rushed or out of place or annoyed. 5/5 stars!"}
{"text":"Horse meat?  Now, that I have your attention...  The Black Hoof is one of my favourite restaurants in the city. I'm not sure why I haven't written a review. But hey, this restaurant deserves another 5 stars and then some.  Eating at the Black Hoof is like crack for adventurous meat-lovers. I'm an addict.  Meat Euphoria.  I always order the charcuterie platter ($19).  Blueberry bison salami! The roasted bone marrow ($9) is a delicious dripping greasy mess.   There is always some variation of a dessert with foie.   Fois and nutella ($25)!   O_O  Awhile back, I asked a friend if he thought the Hoof was appropriate for a date. He said \"Yes, it's carnal\". I've never thought about it that way.  3 word review: Meat. Carnal. Mmm."}
{"text":"Some points with which to preface this review:  1. I have a very limited budget. 2. I can only really afford to go out to eat once a week. 3. I have, in my 5 years thus-far in Toronto attempted to eat at as many places as possible, often to the exclusion of repeated trips to favorites.  4. I only discovered Black Hoof a month and a half ago. 5. I have been six times.  I'm pretty sure that this is not a unique situation, it really is just that fucking great. I have two friends with whom the sole topic of our mutual telephone conversations has been the next time we will meet up to go to the Hoof. The reasons are as follows:  1. The Raw Horse Sammy: This is the last thing I ate there, which is why it goes at the top of the list. If I had have written this review after any of the last 5 times, the number one spot would have been otherwise occupied. This sandwich,with it's admirably blunt appellation (fuck this 'Cheval' shit...you are eating Horsey, no flinching), is a wonderful, wonderfully messy pile of mild and tender horse tartar topped with red onions, capers and a raw egg yolk, perfectly prepped to burst over the warm Thuet bread the moment you sink your teeth (or knife) into the yellow bubble. If that made you feel Ill, skip to number two. If it made you salivate...make plans to go tomorrow.  2. Charcuterie and Cheese-Plates: I actually made myself stop ordering these after the fifth time here, but that alone is a massive anomaly for me (I am usually loathe to order the same thing twice even on familiar menus). The selection of meats is always interesting and broad enough to include at least one item that I am not sure about but is unusual, and one item that I wish I could have in shovelfuls. The cheese-plate is equally dependable and dependably varied, with the added bonus of awesome sauce pairings, most notably blues with delicious so-called pickled walnuts (I refuse to believe the walnuts are actually pickled, but they are awesome with blue cheese).  3. Jamon Iberico: This is the best ham in the world.  4. Pretty much everything else. All the entrees I have tried have been delicious, (share the Testina though, there is a limit to the amount of pig face one person can devour). The cocktails are imaginative and wonderful, the service is friendly, informed and fast, and the atmosphere is relaxed, with a wonderful touch of sustained, often communal excitement about the delicacies on everyone's plate.  My favorite place in Toronto."}
{"text":"First time @Black Hoof this past US Thanksgiving weekend.  Heard it was a tough place to get a seat, so we decided to have dinner first, and then head to the black hoof for a \"snack\" at around 10pm (thursday night).  Given it was a normal Thursday night, it was still packed, but thankfully only had to wait about 15 min for a seat to open up.  They have a few menus written on the walls, so we spent our wait time going over the menu and trying to decide what to get.  Since we were basically full from dinner, we had to limit our choices to about 2 dishes.  Extremely tough given their unique menu (I'll post a picture soon of our menu that night).  They had some items that I couldn't think of eating: raw horse and calf brains....  We happened to sit right in front of the open kitchen, so we got to see all the dishes that were coming out.  There was also a large mirror in front of me, so even though my back was towards the kitchen, i still had a great view.  Lighting was fairly dark, but worked nicely with the atmosphere and decor.  We had to try the charcuterie for two ($16) and finally decided on the hiromasa.  A table of \"foodies\" next to us kept on raving over the hiromasa, so even though the BH is known for their meats, we went for the fish.  we were not disappointed.  the fish was from the yellowtail family (hamachi is my favorite), sashimi over quince and a sauted kale, topped with toasted celery seeds.  The fish was delicious, and the celery seeds really added to the flavor.  Even though there were only a few seeds, the richness of the toasted seeds was amazing.  we couldn't believe how just a few seeds could make such an impact.  Really shows that they focus even on the smallest details to make each dish the best it can be!  The charcuterie didn't disappoint either.  It included 7 different cuts, mostly 4 slices each, including: duck breast, beef and fennel, cappicola, and a summer sausage.  All were delicious, just wish there was more to eat!  Our meal was paired nicely with a few cocktails that we both enjoyed.  overall a great time with delicious food and a cool atmosphere.  It was a bit pricey for the amount of food we good, but definitely a recommended date place for the carnivore foodie."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends for Thanksgiving dinner. I'm not a huge meat eater, and organs, innards and other such delicacies are not normally my thing.  However that day I decided to be open to experimentation and was pleasantly surprised.  Our first serving was the Horse Tartare. It was a good dish to start and not what I expected raw horse to taste like.  It was like sashimi but meatier.  Then came the Bone Marrow.  We had high expectations for this one, but it was nothing special in my opinion.  Though, this was a fun part of the evening.  The bone was heavy and had souvenir value so my friend asked to take it home... not an unusual request it seemed when the waiter was ready and eager to have it 'wrapped up' ; )    Third came the Tongue on Brioche.  This was one of my favourites.  The shredded tongue pieces were tender and flavourful, the brioche was nice and buttery and the mustard sauce and sweet pickles were a perfect compliment to the dish.  I would have liked to have this dish to myself.  Fourth we were served the Liver and Onions. This was an interesting take on liver and onion and worked together nicely.  The onions were extra sweet and came with a green sauce--- not sure what it was but it was good--- on the side. I was also happy to receive a more substantial portion of food after having had multiple dishes that were tiny in size.    Fifth we had the Cotechino and Smoked Sweetbreads.  This was the one dish I was very hesitant to try... eating pancreas just didn't seem right at first : /  ...However, this was the biggest surprise of the night when I found myself enjoying the sausage style sweetbreads and took multiple helpings.   Sixth we had the Chicken Fried Quail.  This dish was basically fried chicken done right.  It was tasty, as fried chicken done right normally is, but it was too small and regular fare to stand out to me much.   Sixth we had the Baby Octo Salad.  This one was a bit of a disappointment. The octopus was too chewy when it should have been more tender and it was lacking in flavour.   Finally we had 'The Dessert.'  This was essentially apple cobbler with salty ice cream. This dish grew on me.  At first I remember craving for the ice cream to be sweeter, but with subsequent spoonfuls I came to enjoy the saltiness, it somehow worked.   All in all this was a very interesting and fun experience.  I will be back for the brioche and the liver and onions.  We missed it this time around, but next time we will also definitely get the Foie-Berry Shortcake, sounds uniquely yummy! ; ))"}
{"text":"Does this place really need another review?  This place speaks for itself!  Amazing food, amazing atmosphere and wonderful waitstaff! Horse tartare is TO DIE FOR! Sweetbreads Amazing! Bone Marrow OMG!  I think it's easier to list the things this place doesn't do well which is well nothing I've ever seen!  Yes I'll say it this place is perfect!"}
{"text":"Great place for a date or with friends. Their food was delicious and was worth the price. I gave one less star because the service was not that good. We came in on a busy night and our server only came to the table when we ordered and that's not really called service."}
{"text":"So good I had went two days in a row to satisfy my eagerness to try everything on the menu.  I love how they stray away from the mainstream and went straight for the adventurous eats. From octopus spaghetti to duck liver mousse it's sure to have your taste buds screaming for MOAR!!!!  I have tried at least a quarter of the menu so far and I think anything you order is a safe bet.  I highly recommend the fois gras on bread pudding as it is the very the best thing my stomach has ever encountered.  Heavenly sweetness !!!  Drink lovers will also get a kick in the selection of crafted cocktails and boutique beers.    I had to wait 45 minutes to grab a seat for two on a Thursday but it was extremely convenient they had also owned a very chic, cocktail bar right across the street."}
{"text":"Go to Black Hoof if you are an adventurous foodie, like to have new things to choose off a menu and for a fun, \"tapas\"style small plate experience. Don't go if you're famished or a vegetarian. I've visited 3 times over the last few yrs and I've had things I really liked, and things that are a little too eclectic for me.   The fois terraine options are always solid.  And the bone marrow is delicious. I like horse meat but The horse tartare was a little ordinary for me The limited and rotating menu is a pro and a con, pro if you like to change things up and you visit often, a con if you want to go back for Something  you loved.  Service was great and the ambience lively. It's a place we will Visit once a year or so to try different and ambitious new plates."}
{"text":"Great concept but they need to work on their execution.  My carpaccio was chewy and the bone marrow was under cooked.  The ambiance of the restaurant and the drinks were decent.  I wont return."}
{"text":"I don't know how fair it is to give a restaurant one star when I didn't get the chance to eat there, but I think I'm justified.  I wanted to go for my birthday a while ago. I asked my parents to meet me there. I was running late from work and arrived about 45 minutes after them. We waited across the street at the Hoof Cafe for an additional TWO HOURS. They kept telling us we were the next table, but then they would seat tables of two, three or four. There were five of us, so I understand that a table may not have come up, but here's what you do: a) when a party of five has been waiting over an hour, wait until a couple tables of two open up and try to put them together instead of seating smaller parties, or b) tell me it's not going to happen and release me from waiting.  I won't go back. I was really pissed at how poorly we were handled. This was last May, so maybe things have progressed, but this is my experience. This isn't New York and you can't do the no reservations line up thing without the density; or when you don't know how to do it properly by giving realistic estimates."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The bone marrow, charcuterie, and mackerel were fabulous. Share everything. Also, get there as soon as it opens as it gets crowded early...even on a Sunday night.  Its also the BEST service I have had in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's one of the reason why I visit Toronto! As good as this. Worth the trip from Montreal. Everything is good but my highlights: bonne marrow, the smoke meat, sweatbreads"}
{"text":"Black Hoof is not for the light hearted, as a gastropub everything on the menu is unique ranging from organs to bones to tounges. One should always push themselves to explore, and this is the perfect place to start.  Personally, my favourite dish of the night was the liver and onions. Going through reviews, it seems this dish is easily forgotten. The liver is made into a smooth mousse which can be spread on bread and topped with the most delicious onions ever. I can't stress how delicious the onions are! Least favourite was the bone marrow, I found it was tasteless and small - of course 70% of the dish was bone.   I recommend going right at opening or an hour to hour and half later when people start clearing out. If you do wait, they'll redirect you to a small bar next door which I'm sure is by the same owner. Try the liver and onions and be open minded! This place is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Oh my. We wandered in here something like twenty minutes before they closed, which I'm pretty sure made them hate us, but oh my was it ever good. (And they were nice to us anyway - that takes class.)  We trekked down Dundas from Ossington looking for something to eat that could match our exquisite drinking experience at Bellwoods Brewery and we were not disappointed. Although we only ordered a couple of dishes (the horse tartare with house made hickory sticks and sweetbreads with sashimi) but both were just out of this world delicious. We also enjoyed a few expertly prepared cocktails.   The menu was so creative and interesting that I can't wait to go back and try some more (and update my review) but I really felt like these guys deserved a shout out for not only putting up with us coming in as late as we did with such good humour but also for delivering just amazing food when we did."}
{"text":"Hoof hearted.  Ice melted.  As a teenager, this was easily the most hilarious thing I had ever heard. Two words, both with completely ordinary meanings, were strung together by some sort of word magician (Dave, from Boy Scout Troop #76) to create something extraordinary and memorable.  Fast forward 20 years and I find myself eating at The Black Hoof on a chilly December night. Similar to Dave and his \"hoof hearted,\" this restaurant utilizes simple things to create masterpieces.  The Horse Tartare ($18), for instance. Who would have thought raw horse meat and an egg yolk would create such a cult following? I think a lot of people order it for the novelty; doing so allows them to go back to their sad circle of foodie friends, who fill the void in their souls with foie and sea urchin genitalia, and brag about eating Black Beauty or Mr. Ed or Shadowfax, Gandalf the White's beloved horse (seriously, you guys need to stop). I, on the other hand, have already eaten a plethora of weird things with my pathetic foodie friends. Scorpions, crickets, eyeballs, feet, organs from every major meat animal...I ate a fucking DONKEY PENIS sandwich last fall.   Unfortunately, eating horse meat isn't that impressive to anyone anymore. LOL :( FML  That said, the horse tartare here is exquisite and you should definitely order it if you enjoy raw meaty things. There was no sinew to be found in this dish, which makes it a winner in my book. The raw egg did its job by adding a rich fattiness to the ultra lean meat, and the seasoning was just enough to bring out the flavor without being overpowering. I'm not going to say it's significantly different than regular steak tartare because it's not. I will say, however, this is a damn good tartare and it's well worth the money.   The bone marrow ($10) is also excellent. It's a simple roasted beef bone. I'm not convinced it's a special bone. I'm also not convinced bones need to be special; they just need to get the job done. This bone comes with a decent chimichurri and good quality sea salt, which both work to accentuate the globs of meat butter after you spread them on slices of toasted country bread. Sure, any of us can probably go out and buy a few beef bones and roast them for less than a dollar, but honestly, who wants to? I feel guilty enough eating cold, week-old lasagna over my sink; I'm not gonna go out and buy a bunch of bones to make meat butter. I'm on a diet!   Thanks, Black Hoof, for roasting bones for me.   Tongue is simple enough. We all have them. It's just a muscle, like a butt muscle or a weiner muscle. On occasion, we may even touch our tongues to other people's tongues and it feels amazing. But cooking tongue is terrible. To make it delicious, you have to boil it for hours and there are all sorts of glands and veins on the back of it, which look disgusting. You also have to remove the skin and tastebuds when it's done cooking. Yes, TASTEBUDS. It's the absolute worst. Again, Black Hoof does all this shit for you, serving up a perfect dish ($14) consisting of thinly sliced tongue and tarragon mayo on brioche with whole grain mustard on the side. It's not the monster sandwich I had at Katz's in NYC this summer; it's a reasonable portion of tender tongue on bread that basically floats away as soon as it hits your lips.   Too much tongue can be unpleasant and you never know when you're going to catch herpes, so eat tongue in moderation, youngsters.  Our final dish of the evening was the Fried Sweetbreads ($18). Now, I don't have a lot of experience with glands, but I'd have to say, sweetbreads are probably my second favorite gland. Maybe third. I guess it's my second favorite gland to eat. Maybe third. I'm not really sure what counts as a gland. The point is, the thymus gland is a great tasting gland. Topped with a soppressata/dried scallop/miso sauce, this dish was a great way to end our evening and I don't regret ordering it when it was time for dessert.   In conclusion, I liked this place a lot. I've wanted to come here for the last 4 years and now that I have, I must say I was completely satisfied with my experience. Prior to my visit, I wasn't really sure what Dave's famous saying meant. Sure, it was a cool way to ask \"Who passed gas?,\" but what was the real meaning?   I think I found the answer tonight.   While there are a number of words I can use to describe my experience at The Black Hoof, I think one phrase perfectly encompasses how I felt the entire night:  Hoof hearted."}
{"text":"I love gastro pubs. There's nothing more comfortable or satisfying for me than a gastro pub. Dark enough to be romantic yet hipster enough to be trendy.  Miscellaneous 4/5 It was rather inconvenient to get to Black Hoof, but the street cars on Dundas, Barthust and Christie make it much easier for folks with no cars.   The menu is hipster enough to be on the board. So you might want glasses to see what's available!   Food 5/5 So good and creative. Here are some items we tried.   Ice cider - very sweet and tasty. Just how I like it. Not as bubbly nor bitter as a hard cider.  Aged manhattan - didn't taste the tawny port in there. It was a little too much bourbon/whiskey in my opinion but my boyfriend liked it! House made bread - nice herbs but with no butter or olive oil, I found it a little plain to eat 3-4 pieces at a go (small portion). Don't think I would try it again.. Bone marrow with salt - so simple and so good! The bone marrow just shone with the awesome grilled bread!! I liked the none marrow with chimichurri but salt was also available.  Pork carnitas tacos - so good!! Love the little crispness on the outer part of the pork. It was tender and tasty. And the guacamole was great!! The lime also brought out great flavor from the pork. I didn't try the spicy sauce but I loved the little container it was held in!! Foie berry shortcake - I cannot believe this is a dessert. Unbelievable. It is so rich and intense but yet tastes so right. It was 25CAN but its well worth the cost. And it was just nice to be shared with two or three other adventurous folks.   Service 3/5 Servers were a little slow for my liking. There was quite a bit of waiting in between orders. And you need to be armed with cash :/ with no ATMs in store.   Black hoof is really tiny, so it's not meant for big parties. And if you don't wanna make reservations you should probably go late or really early ;)"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner and I thought it had a great vibe and a very interesting menu. However, be warned this is not the place to take your non-adventurous friends.  Our group was about 8-10 people roughly and worked out to about $25 per person. The menu is designed to be shareable, but I would say the ideal sized group is 4 people if you are looking to try many things but still get a sizable meal.  Our table ordered: olives, bread, charcuterie, roasted bone marrow, pork carnitas tacos, sweetbreads, foie & nutella and some others I can't recall. My favorites were the tacos and the foie/nutella.   Side note: Don't bring your date here if you plan to go somewhere else after. Guaranteed you/your clothes will smell a bit meaty since the kitchen is open into the dining room. Opt for the patio if this concerns you lol."}
{"text":"This place has been on my must-try list for a while so when i heard its closing down i had to give it a try.  Atmosphere - very hip and trendy. Sat on the patio which was very nice and private. Service - helpful and attentive. Food - didn't disappoint. The flavours and combinations were delicious. Definitely a treat to your tastebuds. They mix savoury and sweets without fail. Must-try is the bone marrow on toasted bread and the horse tartar. Was a little hesitant about the horse tartar but it was super tender and minced very well it practically melts in your mouth. We also tried carbonara with cured bacon....omg the crispy bacon bits with the al dente pasta was bliss. The snowpea tips were an interesting addition but worked very well. I would give this place 5 stars except i felt that they should include more bread for us to spread on.  The bone marrow only came with 2 pieces of bread and the pate only can with 3 pieces of crostini. We ended up ordering bread on the side but it wasn't the same type of bread or texture so the flavour mix and experience of the dish was a bit off. Otherwise this place is still a must-try."}
{"text":"My friends love this place, so I brought my parents while they were visiting the city. I'm extremely disappointed with the treatment we received. Came in around 5, plenty of empty tables. The hostess (who I believe is a co-owner) told us they were reserved, but I knew they don't accept reservations. When I told her that, she rolled her eyes and gave us a table. The only way I can explain that behavior is that she didn't think our group fit her aesthetic and were trying to screen us out. (We are a mixed-race family, but the last time that got us screened out of a restaurant was 15 years ago, so I'm hoping that has nothing to do with it.)  The same woman was our server, and she continued to treat us with contempt during our entire stay. She never smiled, ignored us when we tried to get her attention and wore the most dramatically obvious expression of distaste I've ever seen on a restaurant worker every time she had to approach our table.  I would give one star for this service, but I added one for the quality of the food - it's all perfectly serviceable gastropub cliches. Nothing terrible, nothing original, and absolutely nothing about that merits such delusional pretension."}
{"text":"The decor was nice and food just okay and expensive for the ingredients and portion sizes you get. Black Hoof might be impressive to those who have yet to taste bone marrow, tongue, heart and all those other lovely innards often overlooked in Canadian groceries.  Horse?"}
{"text":"Came across Black Hoof thanks to Yelp! Decided to make it my last meal before flying back home and what a great choice that was! This place is not good for vegetarians. They use all parts of the animal and turn them into tasty dishes. I love the \"weird\" stuff usually so this was a golden find for me. We sat at the bar and service was attentive and friendly.   Tongue on Brioche Sandwich: tongue on tongue action was awesome. toasted but soft bread with a good amount of butter. Horse Tartare: delicious! tasted just like beef tartare.  Cash & Debit only."}
{"text":"Revisited this place since last Toronto trip. The place still has same vibe and is just as fun, serving up lots of fun small French Bistro tapas. All dishes were done creatively and tastefully.  * Snails and Tripe (4 of 5) I thought this dish was creative, however, the food was a little soggy. I thought the dish would showcase the snail and tripe better, but it didn't.  * Foie with Waffle (5 of 5) What a fine combination! I could smell the waffle as they put it on the table. This was a fun and tasty dish. * Pork Belly over Carpaccio (4.5 of 5) Another creative dish. It was very tasty. The pork belly was very rich.  * Scallop over Oxtail (4.5 of 5) Another creative dish.  * SideCar, drink  * RHU of the Day, drink  I really enjoy their changing menu and how everything is always so creative. You almost can't find anywhere else with these dishes. And, this place is so cozy. It has a dim and somewhat romantic setting. This is my number two pick for Toronto eats."}
{"text":"Wow!  I thought I was spoiled in Vancouver but tonight I was on a Toronto winning streak.  After having a great start at Barberian's we went for a 180 degree change in style to Black Hoof.  Here I tried two things I've never had before; horse mortadella and shaved beef tongue.  The first was part of a charcuterie plate with several selections of tasty tidbits.  The second came in a brioche sandwich that basically rivals any Montreal smoked meat and melted in my mouth!  We finished with a blood sausage/foie gras combo that was pretty much to die for and I guess if you ate too many that's probably what would happen.  The place was bustling and the service was prompt, professional and friendly.  There's a decent selection of wines to wash it all done and hopefully fulfil the French Paradox.  Guests sitting closely together all seemed to be having fun and the occasional cross-table conversation was struck up.  I have to leave Toronto tomorrow which is likely good as I'd have to book a second airplane seat if I stay any longer and keep eating like I did tonight.  But I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Toronto.   I came here first time for my birthday and had to come back and try the foie gras fench toast !!  Bone marrow is my other favourite dish from this place. Probably the best valued bone marrow in gta.   Service was awesome.. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to this place back in September, not quite sure why I waited so long to write about it's awesomeness, but here goes...  Me and a chef were in town cooking and asked a local Toronto chef for his recommendations.  This place was at the top of his list.  We arrived on the later side and the place wasn't too crowded, but they were super welcoming and eager.  The plates are small, but I wouldn't quite call them tapas.  Not being one to argue, I let the chef handle the ordering-- the man knows his shit.  Although I am blanking on specifics, I remember everything being awesome.  The charcuterie plate, duck heart tartare, bone marrow with chimichurri, and the dessert at the end (which I am totally blanking on but had the freshest, most intense blackberries I've ever had).  Ingredients were stellar, portions were solid for the price, and the service staff was happy to suggest anything and make conversation.  My favorite part of the meal, though, was when the couple next to us saw my friend and I drooling over their tongue sandwich.  We must have looked cartoonish in our envy because they happily offered us half.  Yes, strangers at the next table, gave us part of their meal, which we graciously accepted, then ordered our own.  Maybe it's a Canadian thing?  That's never happened to me in a restaurant in New York.  And honestly, I don't think it ever will."}
{"text":"Food done at a high level out of one of the smallest kitchens I've ever seen. They have an ordinary stove in there, which makes me wish I could do what they do at home. Small kitchen is very efficient and food comes quickly. Horse tartare is amazing with mayo infused with soy sauce, garlic chips, apples glazed in soy. Duck and waffles are sublime with maple syrup. Smoked sweetbreads were good. No reservations wait can be decent, nice bar across the street owned by same owner good place to wait. Cash only unless you have canadian debit. Service was great for those of you that care about such things(I'm all about the food)"}
{"text":"2 ans à Toronto et j'ai attendu ma dernière semaine avant de rentrer en France avant de le tester.  Sur les avis de nombreux blogs et Monsieur Anthony Bourdain lors de son passage à Toronto je me rends dans ce petit restaurant qui ne paie pas de mine. Je m'attends à 1h d'attente même dans le froid canadien, à ma grande surprise nous sommes 4 et obtenons une table immédiatement.  Rentrons dans le vif du sujet : après avoir commandé votre boisson, bière locale ou vin, je vous recommande les plats suivants que vous verrez affiché sur la grande ardoise sur le mur. - Le MUST : l'os à moelle accompagné d'ail, gros sel et fines herbes. récoltez le succulent nectar et étalez le gentiment sur votre tranche de pain.

{"text":"Excellent small plates. I had the horse tartar, snail and mushroom pasta, sweetbread and the beef tongue and beet salad and enjoyed everything. The horse tartar was perfectly seasoned and was the highlight, the pasta was satisfying, the lightly fried sweetbread had a nice crispiness and the beef tongue had a great texture and the beet salad that came with it was good. The wine I had was also nice and they carried a few harder-to-find aperitifs.  Great spot to come in solo. The staff is friendly, they have a good bar and they do half plates at half price so it's easy to try a lot of different things. 4 (half) small plates was actually a lot of food and came out to be mid-$30s which I think is good value for what you get here."}
{"text":"Took a friend here for a bday and was happy with the service here. The selection of meats here fun amd delicious. Although the prices are very high for the portion and cuts available, as long as you come here for tasting and not to tighten the belt on a dime I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Had to wait an hour before getting in. They will call you after you put your name down. Also there is an off leash park nearby if you like dogs. Service was good. Food was unique. Our favourite was the horse tartare. Melts in your mouth, I can still taste it now. Hands down most amazing flavour and texture I've had in a while. Also a fan of the sea bream. Thought the sausage and marrow were good but nothing special."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks and a bite early Friday, will definitely be back for full dinner, everything we ate was amazing: pistachio hummus with chicken livers was perfect."}
{"text":"The ambiance, the food, the service...everything was wonderful. I came here on a date. My date was not very adventurous with trying new food so we ordered two beers, the oxtail and scallops (DIVINE) and the chicken fried quail (delicious but not as WOW as the oxtail). The portions are incredibly small but with the burst of flavour in each bite was totally worth it.   I would come here again and try the tongue brioche and the meat platter. Not with the same guy though!"}
{"text":"My significant other and I came here after hearing about them on VICE and Bordain's show.   We got the bone marrow to start and it was well-seasoned and rich. Definitely something you'd want to spread on your bread. The grapefruit spread adds another nice element.  We got the charcuterie board with pickles after. To be honest it was okay. Some things on it were better than others, but we aren't entirely sure if it was worth $22. We also got the smoke tongue bao, but the bao really muffled the smoke tongue. Really nothing special.  Service was okay. Felt like they were really trying to push you to buy more drinks and kept asking what we would like to try next. Never once asked how our food was.  I know maybe this review sounds harsh, or maybe people may think we aren't 'sophisticated enough' for a place like that, but in all honesty, we've been to so many places and there are so many better restaurants to eat for better taste and value who also puts a lot of work into their food. We left perplexed as to why this place is popular.  We are glad we tried it, but probably won't come back again.  Food - 2.5/5 Service - 3/5 Atmosphere - 4/5"}
{"text":"Yelpers adore The Black Hoof -- admittedly, so do I. The environment is hip, the prices are reasonable, and the food is good. Nevertheless, the food isn't outstanding enough to justify a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"First, stop reading if you do not like meat. if you do, read on...   The first plus was when i called and learned they were open until 1am on saturday nightI liked the place already.  Too many places in Toronto close way too early.  The atmosphere inside was great. Very full at 10pm but they started us with a drink at the bar while we waited for a table.  The open kitchen allowed us to see what can be done on a circa 1970's electric stove.  Very impressive.  When we got to our table, one by one we discovered that the menu options were exceptional.  We had the tomato salad, cold cut board, bone marrow and the tongue on brioche.  All were exceptional. The tongue was particularly good. It was like a very good pastrami sandwich; sliced very fine and perfectly prepared.  We tried the apple cobbler dessert but it was not that good,, the house wine was excellent, service was exceptional.  All in all, great, unique meal for two for $120 all in. If you are the mood for something different and a nice treat, give it a try."}
{"text":"salad is for suckers.  bone marrow + horse salami + glazed pork belly + pork carnitas tacos + bread + warmed olives + chianti = winning."}
{"text":"The exterior is plain, the interior is dark. Just the way I like my charcuteries. If you don't know what a charcuterie is, let me enlighten you with the simple definition I use for my friends since they don't care for specifics - it's a branch of cooking that is dedicated to prepared meat products - think sausage, terrine, pâtés, etc. Their dishes are rich and earthy. Everything they make (with the exception of a few things) is made in-house and includes duck confit and pork belly.  But the charcuterie platter is my favourite.  It's an intelligent offering of perfectly paired items.   You need a bigger wallet and some patience (because they don't do reservations), but it's worth it. The only thing I didn't like was the bone marrow, not because it wasn't made well, just because I realized I don't like bone marrow."}
{"text":"Upon my first visit to the Black Hoof my expectations were extremely high. Were they met? No...They were crushed! A note to vegetarians: This establishment is a carnivore's utopia, it should be renamed Jurassic Hoof, it is a meat lover orgy that will be the venue for my wedding ceremony.   My first experience was a special one. Upon arriving on a Thursday @ 8pm with 2 other patrons, we were told the wait would be 45min-1hr (no reservations). We waited around outside for 5 or so minutes before deciding that we should go somewhere else as we had a prior engagement to be ready for later that evening. Instead of just taking off I went in to inform the pretty hostess that we were going somewhere else and that I would for sure be back because I heard so much about this restaurant, she told me the best time to return would be Sunday and Monday evenings.   A few minutes later, depressed walking north on Claremont to College, the Hoofstess called me back to inform me 3 seats opened up at the bar and to hurry back if we were not too far! Needless to say we sprinted back and were seated right away. Extremely nice gesture from her considering there were people waiting around outside and the place was completely packed. As we sat down and the serotonin rushed around in my brain I knew it would be a meal to remember without having eaten yet.   We started with olives, bread and andouille spread. The spread was truly exceptional, we savored it throughout our entire meal and when one of the waiters tried to take it away from us when it was 80% finished he received extreme cut eye from all 3 of us followed with me screaming \"NO!\". He was startled but soon realized the power of the spread. In addition came a bowl of pickled vegetables such as artichoke, broccoflower, and pickles. The tartness of the contents of this bowl helped to cut and compliment a lot of the sweet and salty flavours that came ahead.   Our wooden plank of love, aka large charcuterie board was one of the most beautiful things I had ever seen in my life. The neatly laid out meat rested so gracefully in front of me I almost did not want to tamper with it, it looked so perfect and best of all it is mostly made in house changing daily. It consisted of: Guanciale (unsmoked Italian bacon, pig's cheek or jowls) - delicious, Duck Liver Mousse - 1st time for everything, nice spread in subtle portions, Foie Gras - delectably rich & silky smooth texture, Duck Prosciutto - typically darker and tougher than your avg prosciutto, my rule of thumb which never fails is any prosciutto is amazing prosciutto, Angus Sausage - darker and tougher meat, bold flavour, Venison Bresaola - air dried salted, deep woody flavour, there were a few more items on the board but towards the end of the waiter explaining the contents I had drifted off into a foodgasm. This charcuterie board was the most diverse and best tasting example of charcuterie I have had yet.   We had a follow up plank of sheer prosciutto. It was the same sized plank just covered with carefully shaved neatly trimmed layers of sciutto. This was a nice change for me because I am so used to Parma style sciutto and this was house made, so it had a distinct flavour that I can confidently claim I had never had before. The overall flavour had a hint of nuttiness to it and it was lighter in flavour compared to the sciutto I am used to which is very bold very salty. An additional large order or bread and olives accompanied this item.   Next we had the extremely critically acclaimed Raw Horse Sammy Sandwich. I knew this would be a knockout because everyone who previously told me to eat at the Hoof made sure I tried this sandwich. Even when I ordered it our waitress's eyes perked up and she smiled. I could tell in her heard she was thinking \"These dudes are gonna lose it when they see/try this\".   The sandwich arrives open faced on rye bread. One side has the rich, velvety, purplish/red meat mixed with onions, olive oil, some herbs topped with capers and an egg yolk. The other side has the signature hot sauce compliments of G-Mo, the Peruvian sous-chef. Ideally you want to spread the yolk all over the meat and get it right into and around the meat, this will prevent the yolk from dripping out of the sandwich when you eat it thus locking in all the love, and believe me, there's a whole lotta love. One of the major highlights of this sandwich for me is that I had never had anything like it before, the texture, taste and whole vibe of the sandwich was new to me, and as I sit here typing I am borderline losing it recounting this experience. Truly a magical dish worthy of its own restaurant.   I simply can not wait to go back to this restaurant. I have yet to try the duck confit sandwiches, cheeses, roasted bone marrow, tongue on brioche, deserts, wine, and daily delights. For the record I could care less about the décor because I don't take my eyes off the food.   Thurs-Mon 6pm-2am, Sun (midnight)  patio cash/d"}
{"text":"Oh Black Hoof, you are fine fine fine.  There will be a wait. Oh yes, there will be a wait. But time goes by faster when you're drinking cocktails next door, no? (Yes.)  I've been here twice in the past two months, and had been once (back in the day) before Grant left. I was worried that the quality would fall, but luckily as of yet I see no such signs.  A group of people (including the lovely Rachna C) went out. We ordered the charcuterie platter, cheese platter, tuna crudo, bone marrow, pork carnitas, warm olives, and two bowls of bread. (We are growing men and women, who must have our bread.) This is not a place where you get a lot of food, but each single bite is full of flavour, and savory, making the meal very satisfying, if not overly filling.  I had the tea and sympathy cocktail with the meal, made with earl grey infused gin, and sherry and it was lovely.  Our meal split 5 ways came to $38 each. It's easy (VERY EASY) to spend more than that, but we left satisfied, and it was definitely money well spent."}
{"text":"A group of a us randomly picked several dishes to try and every single one of them was delicious; the most memorable was the bone marrow. The vibe is good, but the food really made the experience for me. If you're a meat lover, then this definitely is a must in Toronto."}
{"text":"Holy freaking crap. This place is amazing! The menu is a chef d'oeuvre of carnivorous delights.   First let me say that if you dine at the Hoof you MUST try the charcutrie. As others have mentioned, there is charcuterie (cured/cooked meat platter served on a wood plank) and then there's Black Hoof charcuterie. This is their speciality. For two, go with the regular size. The large is good for a group of 4 or more to share.   Next, we tried the succulent marrow. At fist, I was a little apprehensive but based on the reviews I forced myself to scoop some of the oily gelatin onto a piece of rye bread and oh my god... this is quite possibly the best thing I've every eaten. I recommend adding a pinch of the raw salt that comes with it. It enhances the flavour a hundredfold.   Finally I HAD to go for the raw horse sandwich. Now this may sound disgusting or blasphemous to some but let me warn you, your taste buds will love you for this. Get over your PETA loving self and try this thing! A very well prepared steak tartare made with horse meat shallots and a raw egg for texture served open-faced on rye bread with a speciality spicy sauce (with which they cleverly spell \"Horse\" on your bread).   Lastly, the wine list, rotating cocktail offering and on-tap beers are all very good."}
{"text":"This place doesn't need another recommendation but I want to leave one anyway.  The charcuterie board here is bar none the best I've ever had. Everything is smoked and cured in house. We also got a cheese board with accompliments and really enjoyed it. Service was okay but not the friendliest(we sat at the wood) but that's okay since we were here for a late night bite and was glad to find somewhere open. Note:You have to pay extra for the bread.  Will be coming back again soon to see what else there is."}
{"text":"Popped in right when it opened Sunday evening to avoid the crowd. Ordered a good variety of dishes; overall wasn't blown away:  Charcuterie - There were a couple of delicious items on this arrangement, including a duck sausage that you could almost taste the duck, as well as a pate that involved some kind of bacon. The rest of the meats looked eclectic but tasted rather the same.  Bone Marrow - I suppose this is the must-try item. The marrow is very rich and pairs well with the seaweed and sea salt for a more refreshing bite.  Chicken Fried Quail - Quite tender, but not much else to say for this dish.  Pork Carnitas Tacos - it was by far the favourite of most of my table, and an interesting combination of pork / lime juice / guac; personally did not find it especially unique or tasty  Sweetbread Karaage - the sweetbread has a good texture. but everything on the plate was too salty - way too salty  Tongue on Brioche - this was my personal favourite as I adore brioche and the texture you get with tongue - this one especially tasted a bit like the smoked meats you get from Montreal"}
{"text":"Definitely a great dining experience. The space is small but they manage well.  Ordered the bone marrow and oxtail and scallops and side of veggies.  Might I say if broccoli was served like this I'd eat em everyday.  The bone marrow size and quantity was pretty less but good flavour. I've had better scallops but oh my that oxtail was delicious!  Great meal!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend suggested this place and we did see a exclusive on this place on Bizarre Food's Toronto.  I was up for something different and my gf is just as curious about trying new types of food as I am.  This place was indeed that, totally different and a completely different experience that I am used to.  Since you can't make reservations here, we tried our luck out on a Saturday evening.  Luckily there were a few tables available for some odd reason and I scored a parking spot right in front!  The parking situation isn't terrible, but it's mainly just metered street parking around that area.  We tried the horse tartar, bone marrow, pigs blood paperadeli and pork jawl to name a few.  Each dish tasted completely different than the next and each one was full of flavours I haven't really experienced before.  I have eatten a lot of animal innards and strange parts cooked in an asian style, but having them served up in a gourmet style setting was great.    My gf and I are definitely going to come back and give this place another try and sample other various dishes we missed last time!"}
{"text":"Note: This place is not for vegetarians. Or vegans. Or anyone who wants to be either of those things.   Black Hoof is a really random place that I would not have gotten to if not for my non-faint-of-heart friends.   Everything here is shared, but the plates are still extremely small.  Come for just chilling and eating something strange and new and delicious, not for lunch or dinner (unless you are generally not a hungry/black-hole stomach kind of person). I had dinner 2 hours before coming to Black Hoof and I was still able to eat more. (I am a hungry/black-hole stomach kind of person).    My two friends and I were seated in the back patio and it was a gorgeous summer night. The sun was just setting, it wasn't too hot or too cold. The ambience was amazing and the servers are really on point with the water.   Well, unlucky for you guys and lucky for my friends, I only got A picture of one of the food items we ordered.   Here is what we ordered: 1. Bone Marrow I didn't try the bone marrow because I don't eat beef, but as reviewers say, and my friend who ordered it remarked, \"Wow, so oily.\" Yes, it was quite the oiliness. She said she liked it though.   2. Surf and Turf Shrimp and pork croquette? I can't remember, but this was good. As you can see from the picture, the portion is REALY small. The 3 of us sharing this dish went to our bellies in less than 2 minutes.   3. Horse tartare I had this kind of tartare-like food item when I was in Germany. It looked just like burger, except it was raw. Horse tartare tasted exactly like that. I can't remember if it had any \"horsey\" taste, whatever that means. It just tasted like raw meat, and it was strange. I personally am not a fan of eating raw animals - the little vegetarian in me is screaming, so it wasn't BAD or GOOD. It was.. interesting. I think the seasoning was pretty well-done though. If you've never had tartare before, tartare is EXACTLY how you think it would taste: cold and slimy.   4. Eggplant tortelli  This one was my favorite. I don't know if their pasta is homemade but it tasted really good. I really do love eggplant though. I would most definitely order this again if I come back.   5. Smoked tongue bao  It is BEEF tongue. I heard it was good, but it smelled like any old regular bao.   6. Dessert - ice cream WHO DOESN'T LIKE ICE CERAM.    Would I come back again? Maybe. Maybe for their drinks and their eggplant tortelli. Maybe if I was just looking for a nice ambiance. Maybe if I wanted to try their sweetbreads.    TLDR; Very expensive and you probably won't get full. So, wait, why are you coming here again? If you wanted to taste their interesting meats and delicious eggplant tortelli. The ambiance is also nice and the waitress remembered all our orders without writing any of it down, so that was pretty cool."}
{"text":"have been 5 times, always amazing, great service, great food, best charcuterie in the city hands down.*Update - I am now a regular, I go about once a month and it continues to evolve...easily one of the best restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"The black hoof is a great local hub! Service was great even on the busy night! They have a variety of beers on tap bound to please everyone and the prices for it are very fair. They do corkage which is a nice touch for 25 dollars..and THE FOOD was amazing!!! I loved the pork belly and tacos they have siooo  much flavour and were so juicy they literally melt in your mouth delicious.. The shrimp came with a delicious sauce which added amazing flavour!! It's a tapas oriented place so don't come if you don't like shAring... We were able to get a table by the window which was lovely. I do wish they haves a patio but I like the intimate vibe they have going here!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Black Hoof.  I have been a foodie and in the industry in Toronto for years, but I have held back from dining at Black Hoof because I don't agree with Jen Agg's ... policies.  No credit cards? No vodka?   However, I decided I was finally ready to take the plunge.  Walked in on a Thursday night and the patio had no space.  At first we attempted to sit at the bar (our favourite place to sit in a restaurant) but it was so warm from the oven that we couldn't do it.  So we moved to a table.  (it was much easier to see the food and drink chalkboards from there anyway; these are really hard to see from most places in the restaurant)  Service was friendly and fast.  I sort of expected attitude from the servers, but we got nothing but positive vibes.  We had the bone marrow (was $8 market price that day), the pistachio hummus with chicken livers, the pork tacos, the warm olives and the tongue on brioche.  To drink, I had the house red, which was very nice.  The food stood out to me right away because it was all served at the exact correct temperature.  I have a real beef (no pun intended) with food being served too cold, lukewarm, tepid...ugh.  I want hot food to be HOT.  REALLY HOT.  Even if I have to wait to consume it while it cools down.  And I want cold food to be freezing - anyway.  All the food came out piping hot and fresh and great.  The olives were big and plentiful (almost TOO many olives, if that's a thing!).  The bone marrow was oily and came with chimicurri sauce and salt, which I didn't use because I love straight up marrow, but I did end up using with hummus and chips and they were great.  Definitely get the tongue brioche, and definitely get the marrow.    Liked the overall vibe a lot, but this is a one-time place for me, or a place you take out of towners to show off some interesting things our city is doing.  Don't know that it'll become part of my regular rotation...although typing about the food just now made me want it again....damn you, Agg."}
{"text":"This is an extremely famous place and I get the appeal. People want to try the off-cuts, it's trendy but there is a right way of doing off-cuts and a wrong way. Guess which the Black Hoof chooses. The Bone Marrow was subpar, the bread was burnt and the tongue was tough. Off-cuts might be their specialty but there far off from being good when it comes to food. On food alone it was around a 2.5, a bit pricey but I get it. The real problem was the service, a staff member stepped on my foot and no apology! I complained and they just laughed! Also surprised McDonald's hasn't sued them yet, filet-o-fish and McMuffin? REALLY??!!"}
{"text":"enjoyed the scallop carpaccio and pate w/ cippolini onions.  Also enjoyed sampling the local late harvest cab franc and icewine.  one glass of wine was served in a hot glass which was not good.  cocktail selection could be more extensive although I realize that Toronto mixologists are severely handicapped by LCBO restrictions."}
{"text":"Service I had such AMAZING service at the Black Hoof. We left our name and number and we were called within an hour of waiting as the lady had promised. Unfortunately we didn't score a table and sat at yet another bar but our waiter/bartender was extremely attentive. I wish we had looked up the menu before because their food is written on 2 separate chalk boards at the front and back of the restaurant. I did get a little pissed off at that because these 2 menus offer no images (I'm a visual kind of person) and I had no idea what they meant LOL. I'm used to stuff like \"fish and chips\", \"steak\" - and not menus like \"horse tartare\" and \"charcuterie\". But do not worry, I will go into detail later after consulting google. Anyhow our bartender/waiter had to repeat the names for us but seriously I didn't understand lol. He was very nice but the place was a bit loud. We really enjoyed our time here but at the end he got EXTREMELY busy making drinks - delaying the cheque process and didn't even say Thank You at the end. We were puzzled because we had left more tips than we generally would.  Food You should not come alone because all the items are for sharing. I had a difficult time taking photos because the place was so dark and I think my \"flashes\" pissed people off lol. Charcuterie ($19) This place prides itself in charcuterie - an art of cooking that focuses on prepared meat products. It usually is served on a plate. We LOVED this plate even though we still mispronounce the word. You get 2 different sauces to dip your meat and it is best served with bread. Because charcuterie typically involves an addition of salt, you might find yourself drinking a little more water. Anyhow, we have really unique meat here (I wish I could tell you what they were) and they are sliced SO thin - it's like they have perfected the skill of cutting lols.  Horse Tartare ($18)  Also commonly used for steak tartare, it is a dish where meat is served raw (chopped or minced). Most often, this dish is accompanied by onions and a raw egg. When your dish arrives, make sure you combine everything together so that the egg is thoroughly mixed within the meat. It is also recommended that you order bread with this dish. Honestly, I did not like it though I didn't hate it. My boyfriend was like, \"The bread taste is covering the horse taste lol\". Anyhow I'm sure there are many others who would enjoy this much more than me - maybe I just don't like it raw or I just don't like horse?  Tacos ($11)  Since their menu changes frequently I forgot what type of tacos I got. They do come in 3 and you can add more money for 4. 3 was actually enough for the both of us because each one is big. You can add hot sauce in the tacos and let me warn you: your hands will get dirty. Why I really like the tacos is 1. so cheap 2. the fillings are so tasty 3. the tacos are soft. There is just nothing about these tacos - they even come with these crunchy little things on the side. Shrimp chips? Lol.  I'm sure others would find this place even more worthwhile and I will come back to taste the other dishes. Very unique place! FYI their website is gorgeous. I love how they designed the staff page - it gives everyone credit for the hardwork they put in. The only negative thing to do this place: debit and cash only."}
{"text":"We had wanted to come here for a while, and after experiencing Jen Agg's Agrikol in Montreal, decided we owed it to ourselves to visit The Black Hoof. The menu is ecclectic, but amazing. The food really was superb. Our favourite dish was most certainly the pork belly and spruce dish. But nothing failed. The drinks were extremely well done, too. LOVED their version of the Manhattan. Where there was a bump, though, was the service. One of our servers was super fun and super chill, while the other was too uptight for our good. While busy, the restaurant was not full, and there was no need for tension. We love The Black Hoof, but clearly in the absence of its creator, there is room for improvement...even if just a bit!"}
{"text":"Incredible food and fantastic service. This place exceeded all my expectations. The pork carnitas tacos were phenomenal and the tongue on brioche was delicious.  Arrived shortly after 6 so seating was not an issue."}
{"text":"I was told we'd be coming to Black Hoof, and that it was a 'weird food' place. Definitely some unique and different foods on the menu, but it was all delicious!  A very small space that was extremely dimly light, and relatively louder music. Usually it's not a bad thing for an establishment, but not my preference for place to have some dinner. I couldn't really see what I was eating, so presentation didn't really matter whatsoever. It was a bit of a letdown, as it seemed like they put effort into it too.  The music and ambiance was quite loud as well, which made people talk even louder. I could barely hear those I came with, let alone what the server had to say.   Fortunately, the uniqueness and flavour of the food made up for all that. Chose a while bunch of stuff off the menu, and was quite happy with most of them.  First, the cocktails were all very unique and delicious. A little pricey, but the Autumn Sour and the Tea & Sympathy were definitely the best.  The food options were some of the coolest I've seen in one place. The highlights for the night were definitely the Horse Tartare, Pistachio Hummus & Chicken Liver, Pig's Ear Slaw, and the Bone Marrow. Amazing taste and flavour for each dish, with the Bone Marrow at the best price that night.   Service was top-notch, as they came to refill water consistently and change the plates and utensils between dishes. They only suffered there due to the music as it was very hard to make out what they were trying to say   An amazing spot to try different kinds of foods. Would definitely come back, but maybe in a little while."}
{"text":"The food is insanely good. The dining experience is ALMOST there. The service is intermittent - you never quite know how well you're going to be cared for. Last time we brought friends from out of town and we practically had to beg to be served. We probably would have spent another hundo if the server showed up.   Regardless, I'll continue to pop in when I'm in the area because charcuterie is the bomb and they do it well."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. Portion is tiny even for tapas. Price is exuberantly overpriced. Either quality or size has to increase dramatically, or price needs to come down at least 30%. And what's with no credit cards?!  Service was good though."}
{"text":"So we tried getting in for cocktails since we went to Cocktail Bar, they were packed, and suggested we come here.   Were then  told by the Black Hoof staff that although there were tables free to go across the street to Cocktail Bar since Hoof was still in dinner service.   Seriously??  Dinner sercice at midnight??  So even though their were tables we were turned away. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a real gem, located in a very cool part of town. Cozy atmosphere, good service, and an excellent selection of wines. The space is a bit crammed, which wouldn't make it an ideal destination for a large party but makes it a very good spot for a dinner date.  We had the bone marrow (a feast of flavors!), the \"Eat your vegetables\", some amazing liver paté (perfect taste and consistency), and a charcuterie board.  I was really impressed by the selection of cured meats, which gave a taste of different countries and regions. I can't say how authentic all their meats were, but as an Italian born and raised in Italy, whose family has been curing meat for generations, I can attest their soppressata is the real thing. In fact, it's probably the only authentic one I ever tasted in a restaurant -- perfectly seasoned, not soggy, right amount of spiciness and saltiness: really, really perfect. Would definitely go back there.  Yes it can be a bit pricey but you get the quality you pay for."}
{"text":"Well tuned chefs working in organized chaos in an open kitchen with electric stoves set the atmosphere  and enhance the level of excitement as you walk in. The food and drinks are nothing short of exceptional with an ever changing menu. The cash only policy is annoying and the front house staff has a tendency to come off as pretentious. Having said that I love the food and will be back again."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom!  The understated exterior hides the deliciousness that lies within this restaurant.  Our party of five came just after another party of six, so we hopped across to the Hoof Cafe to wait and to start our evening anyway after leaving our number.  We were called over well within the 1.5 hour wait that we were warned about and proceeded to indulge in the fabulous charcuterie plate as well as the cheese spread.  While charging for bread was a bit eyebrow-raising, I would say that no restaurant is obliged to provide bread, and charging for it at least ensures that there's no unnecessary waste of the carb-y compliment to the salty stars of the evening.    The charcuterie and cheese spreads were definitely about a refined sense of complements!  The salty meats and cheese were often paired with sweet jellies and dollops of things that drew out the awesomeness of the thinly sliced pieces of cured meats and dairy.  The male individuals in our party were particularly gleeful when the foie gras wrapped in butter was mentioned by the server.  The richer it was, the happier they were.  Other items consumed included the duck heart with foraged mushrooms among others which was beyond fabulous.  Kudos to the chef for hunting for these mushrooms personally.  That's dedication!"}
{"text":"foie gras + nutella = :)  Seriously that was the dessert that was available when Julia and I had dinner there this month.  I love this place and after all the generic food I had been eating in Toronto near the Convention Center it was a pleasant discovery.    They also have a lot of good beers on tap here and the food was delicious.  We started off with the tuna which was perfect: flavorful yet light!  Then came the carnitas tacos which were small tacos but nicely balanced, especially if you put on a lil bit of the hot sauce that accompanies it.  We also had pork belly which was pretty good although probably the least favorite of the four things we tried.  Definitely a nice spot and I'd love to come back and force Julia to try the sweetbreads which she was afraid to try this time out :)"}
{"text":"After trying their horse meat tartar, my boyfriend had been raving about this place for a long time, and we finally went this past weekened.  He warned me that there was a chance we would have to wait for a while, and was he ever right. There was an hour and a half wait time.   Jennifer Agg, the owner, took down my name and number and called me exactly after an hour and a half. In the meantime, we went to get a drink across the street at cocktail bar. It seemed like the norm....When we went back to the Black hoof, unfortunately, we were only able to get two seats by the bar. Good thing i'm not claustrophobic. It didn't end up being that bad and the bartender was so helpful and on top of his game! We each got wine--i obviously had to go with the Gewurztraminer.   There are no menus, it is however all written on their blackboard. We started with olives that were served warm. We also ordered the charcuterie board, the fois gras mousse, the riccota and tomato agnolotti, the pork tacos and the tuna crudo. I loved the fois gras mousse. I had never seen it served wtih a white coating (i'm guessing it was butter but I am not quite sure.) The charcuterie board was also a highlight with a variety of different meats that varied in hotness. The pasta was amazing and the tomatoes so fresh. I also enjoyed the pork tacos, however, my least favorite dish was the tuna crudo because i could still taste the ice and it was wayy too fishy. After indulging in all these rich foods, we went ahead and both got two different kinds of port. I had the madeira, which came in a cute little crystal glass and it was really good.   I know this is supposed to be the best tapas place in Toronto, but I'm going to go ahead and say it--I love Cava more."}
{"text":"This is by far my favourite restaurant in the city. It's a difficult one to go to with a gluten intolerance but when you're determined it's possible! The first time I went, I went back again 2 days later...it is that good. What I love about it is Jen remembered me when I went back. It's truly not about how many people you can push through, it's about sharing the experience of food.   Since a lot of these reviews have already probably told you how great all of the food is, and it's served to you in the appropriate order for your pallet, I'm going to help out the gluten-free people out there. First thing's first, it can be done! Yes, almost everything is served to be eaten with bread but we know how to enjoy it without what can be described as just a facilitator for the good stuff.  * Horse Tartare - Don't be afraid by the purple colour, it can be intimidating but it's worth the try! It's very good without bread and the fries onions give it a bit of texture and crunch!  * Charcuterie board - you will really be able to taste the difference between the meats when tasting it without bread. The horse is amazing, don't skip it!  * Beef tongue - comes shredded inside brioche. It's so loaded with meat you can easily find parts that haven't touched the bread and it taste delish with a little aioli on it's own. Reminds me of pastrami.  * Seasonal veggie plates are so good. We once had asparagus and morels - so freaking good, seriously!  * Pork belly and carpaccio - either of these are usually gluten free on their own and they are two items I rarely skip on a menu. Delicious.  * Fois gras and (waffles/Nutella) - easy to have a taste of the fois gras on top of the waffles. Not really worth it to order if no one is going to have the waffles though, it's not a must-have.  * Bone marrow - I tried my best to taste this without bread but honestly, it just is no good unless you get to spread it on top of bread and it's not worth it to try!  My favourite part of the restaurant is the kitchen, it's right there and not closed at all. It feels like you're in a friend's home in a tiny kitchen with hand-me-down appliances. It proves that you really don't need a bunch of fancy kitchen items to make delicious food!  Oh & cocktail bar across the street is the best place to wait for a table, or just go for drinks!"}
{"text":"First trip to Toronto and based on Yelp reviews we made sure to stop by on our first night in town and only night it was open while we were there!  Overall it was a great dining experience, while we had a bit of a wait, which we expected and had hoped to avoid but it took much longer to get to Black Hoof than we had expected...but it was worth the wait!    We had the house made prosciutto which was a larger serving than I expected, bone marrow, a pasta made with tripe and other beef, and pork shoulder.  The atmosphere was great and reminded us of a place we go to in Southern California.  The staff was really helpful, but I think my favourite part of the experience was the Lavender Pisco...hmm so tasty!  Pisco apparently is a foreign brandy and they infused it with Lavender.  The rest of the drink included lemon and lime juices, simple syrup, and egg white to make a dreamy frothy top...  it was different and deLICIOUS!  I will definitely be working on my own version at home...it was like a soft whiskey sour...but so much more eloquent.    Besides that I would say the bone marrow was my favourite surprise of the evening.  I was a little worried about it, as it was my first experience, especially when my husband started to scoop the gelatinous texture onto bread and seeing one large portion of bone and marrow thinking gosh I hope I like this because I would feel horrible if I let all this go to waste...but add some of the amazing chimichurri sauce and salt and it was superb!  I wouldn't eat it all the time but I think once at a special event on an annual basis would be perfect.  Melts like butter in your mouth.  Definitely a great experience but would have liked to have some interesting vegetable concoctions on the side as well...but I get the concept and would probably give them a 4.5/5 stars."}
{"text":"My GF is pretty much a vegetarian and this place has absolutely no vegetables.  When we asked for vegetables, they said they have 'tomatoes and mozzarella' (neither is a vegetable).  We asked for that dish with no balsamic vinegar and the chef refused.  What an arrogant pretentious inconsiderate meathead.    Otherwise if you like meat, this is a super place to dine.  They cure their own meats for the charcuterie, and the dishes are creative, simple and wonderful.  The special mixed drinks are also fantastic in the same creative way.    Some people consider this the best restaurant in Toronto, but if you have dietary restrictions avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"I can see how they were once cool. But it's very 90's. Still pretentious with no menu and hipster services. Marrow is ok, you can find it anywhere now. People in the kitchen cooking seem reall nice and hard working I give them an extra star. A lot of the food was on bread. We ended up eating a lot of the same bread."}
{"text":"i honestly don't know how i could possibly describe the deliciousness that is black hoof. we discovered this place on yelp, as well as seeing it featured on the layover. we like the bourdain so we usually try to check out places that he suggests. it doesn't always work out but in this case it did, it far surpassed my expectations.  black hoof is one of those restaurants that doesn't offer an expansive menu but it does offer a more delectably diverse selection than most places do. some of their offerings include horse tartare and sweet breads. I have a moral issue with eating horse so I didn't try any.  we had the charcuterie board with all house cured meats, house made pickles, ham hock terrine, pig ear slaw, and beef tongue on brioche. it was some of the best food i've ever had. my favorite was the ham hock terrine.  though the tongue on brioche was also amazing.  to be completely honest, you can't go wrong with anything at this little spot. go.  eat.  drink.  now."}
{"text":"Sorry to pull against the tide of overwhelmingly great reviews.  I just can't accept that this is considered the most favoured restaurant in the city. Yes, it's good, but please, how can a place that specializes in horse innards or whatever be the best restaurant in the city?  I've been there.  I ate the food.  It was good.  Was it fantastic? No.  Was it worth the wait?  Not really.  Will I go back?  No, because it's just not worth the hassle or the $$.  Seriously, I think this is trend that will be short-lived, and one day we'll all try hard to remember how we could possibly have thought that the best food in the city was horse tartar."}
{"text":"Yes im a fan. Ate here the other night and it was good. Cool place with a great atmosphere and food. These guys are whats up"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Wonderful tasty food.  Not your typical fare though. Chicken livers and pistachio hummus with paprika dusted pita chips was a definite winner. But it was a tough choice as there were several other front runners like the cavatelli with ramps and spring vegetables. Beef tongue and brioche was another flavour surprise. And the waffle bread pudding with warm toffee and house made vanilla ice cream was an amazing way to end a wonderful dinner. Oh yeah, the cocktails were amazing too! Can't go wrong with this place! Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the \"unusual\" menu!"}
{"text":"No joke this place has been on my bucket list for 4 years. We came at 10pm for a very late dinner and also to avoid the lines. When I called at 7pm on a Saturday, even a table for 2 had a wait of 45 mins. At 10pm, we were seated immediately. Once inside, I understood why the wait is long - they only have 7-8 tables and 10 bar seats (at most).   The place is small and cozy and dimly lit with table candles. It was quite dark so trying to take a nice picture or to see your food clearly was a tad difficult. I really liked the atmosphere though.  For 2 people, we got 5 dishes:  1. Charcuterie board - this was yummy, but there wasn't anything special about it. For $19, I'd probably pass on it next time. It came with some delicious fresh bread, but I wish it had other components of a charcuterie board (such as jam, pickles, etc). It was also a lot pricier than most things on the menu.  2. Bone marrow - I didn't love this. A bit too oily and salty.  3. Ham hock terrine - so yummy! The toppings were great and it was quite refreshing and light (for the big chunk of meat that it is).  4. Pig ear slaw - my FAV dish! I wish there were more pig ear than slaw (it was 20% pig ear), but this salad was a perfect complement to the rest of the meat dishes.  5. Foraged mushrooms - tiny portion for 5 types of mushrooms 5 ways.  If I could I would've ordered another pig ear's slaw - it was that good!  Best thing is, everything on the menu is basically under $20 and most things are around $8-$15. Great food for great"}
{"text":"Not that great since Grant left. Charcuterie is forgettable. Mains are OK.  Cons: No reservation, debit only  Try it once and then move on..."}
{"text":"Really good food.  Nice atmosphere.  I had the sausage (excellent), the pickles (v good), and the marrow (great.)  The charcuterie looked fantastic, though I didn't taste it. Only criticism: more vegetable choices, please. (Today I think there was only mixed veggies and pickled veggies.)"}
{"text":"Took my girlfriend for dinner to celebrate her birthday and we tried a bunch of different plates. Everything was incredible, though our favourite was the Chicken Liver and Pistachio Humus! It was unbelievable, and so creamy!"}
{"text":"The quality and novelty of the food alone makes Black Hoof a must visit. It's one of the few places you'll find pork jowl, lamb tartare and roasted bone marrow on the menu. Ordered in a tapas fashion, each dish is portioned to keep you coming back for more.   Our party of three started off with a few different dishes to share amongst ourselves. I'd recommend doing the same so you have the opportunity to try as much off the menu as possible.   My favorite dish of the night was the smoked pork jowl. Complimented with figs and a creamy white sauce the pork had the flavor and crispness of quality bacon while still remaining fall-apart tender on the inside. The only disappointment for me was their roasted bone marrow. The extracting of which turned out to be harder than we thought with much of the marrow spilling onto the plate and table while we attempted to transfer it from bone to bread.  Loud and exciting, Black Hoof is an excellent dinner option for those seeking a delicious and adventurous meal."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Toronto. I've been going regularly since it opened and I can honestly say, out of literally dozens of meals, I've never had a bad one. The food, service, and atmosphere are all fantastic and reliable. I know my money will be well spent and I will walk away happy after a night at the Hoof (and Rhum.. and Cocktail Bar..)"}
{"text":"***This place Is A MUST visit when you're in town!***  I decided to take my fellow yelpers' advice and arrived 5 minutes early to end up first in line in a queue of about 7 or so.  At 6 pm there was plenty of seating available on a Saturday night, so don't fret folks on arriving super early like I did.  Now take what I say with a grain of salt because I heard a few locals say it was surprising that there was no wait for the night. Perhaps Halloween weekend may have played a role in the smaller turn out. Regardless, I was elated to land a pimp spot by the window!  The ambiance inside was sort of what I expected: it had an eclectic 60's throwback diner sorta vibe with mint green glass tiles below chocolate brown walls throughout the small space. An expansive bar flanked the entrance foyer lined with artsy vintage mint green bar stools. In the background, there was chill music of the indie persuasion playing quietly.   We reviewed the menu on the black chalk board and went with a handful of selections starting with glasses of wine and...  The Charcuterie Plate Wow, the line up of delectable cured meats was quite copious! In fact, I don't recall our party being able to finish this behemoth of a serving. That being said, it was a fine selection of delectably thin sliced meats sure to satiate a variety of discerning palates. Honestly, there were way too many to recall but Chorizo, spicy Horse, mortadella, Proscuitto, beef heart, spruce, spicey smoked summer sausage were a few names I could remember the extensive list of cold cuts. They came accompanied with a small bowl of pickled veggies and the match was perfection. The pickled veggies added a welcome brightness and acidity to the earthy and rustic flavors of the cured meats.  I would highly recommend the charcuterie and pickled veggies with a glass of wine as a starter before you begin your dining adventure here.  Bone marrow  Served with course sea salt, a house chimichurri, and crisp sourdough toastettes to spread the marrow on, this dish did not disappoint. The marrow was fatty, rich and a mouthful of goodness in every bite!  Blood Sausage & Popcorn with mosch & grain mustard  Whoah, this was the richest and most buttery sausage I've ever eaten! The light and crunchy popcorn was a perfect accompaniment to this decadently rich and flavorful dish!  Spicy Horse Tartare Not quite spicy but a winning dish all the same! I loved the contrast in textures of the crispy shredded  potatoes with the velvety soft and buttery tartare. The fresh dill and the caper hollandaise added a brightness and saltiness that balanced the flavors of this delightful dish very well! One of my favorites!  Deep fried sweetbreads with tuna crudo Spicy mayo and pickled jalapeños -  The deep fried thymus glands were quite substantial and dare I say tasted like chicken! Paired with the spicy mayo, it had a smoky flavor that worked well with the acidity of the citrusy tuna crudo. The added pickled jalapeño rounded the amazing flavor profiles perfectly! Highly recommended   Foie Gras, Nutella & Banana pain per du with lemon gastrique -  This was by far the best dish of the evening! They seriously saved the best for last! The combination of the rich and smooth foie gras, sweet and tart lemon gastrique, crunchy hazelnut crumbles, velvety Nutella, peppery chervil, and fluffy banana pain per due was a match made in foodie heaven! Foodgasm guaranteed and \"a must\" if you dine here!  What I appreciated was the fact that each dish came out at a nice pace, they constantly changed out our utensils/plates,  and we never felt rushed throughout our remarkable 2.5 hour dining experience.   As the evening progressed, we noticed many people turned away being told there was at least a 1.5 hour wait for a seat, so i felt very fortunate to land a seat for the night.  Overall, I had a fantastic experience here and it's safe to say I'd be coming back for more when I'm in town...  And let's face it, If Thomas Keller wanted to dine here, how could it bad, right?  Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"I went there with BF on Sunday. The food tasted good. But they were very small portion, plus full of fatty."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum, there is no place as chic as the Black Hoof for cocktails and meat delicacies.    You have heard it before, and believe me the CHARCUTERIE PLATTER is awesome.  My date and I went for the small and were quite satisfied as a starter.  We should have ordered the large bread over the small, but for $2 who cares.  Well, actually I do.  When you spend so much money on a platter of cold cuts, the bread should be complementary.  Just saying...  My favourites were: the Duck prosciutto, It melted in my mouth like savoury butter; the walnut and pork salami; and the pork liver mousse, which was like air.    For our main, we shared the PORK BELLY WITH WATERMELON.  The thick slab of belly was stewed in watermelon juice and cumin until it was tender and the sauce became thick.  The flavours were intense, and rustic with just enough sweetness from the melon.  Unfortunately, the pork was far too salty for my taste, and I couldn't enjoy very much of it.    To drink SPICY GUAVA MARGARITA.  Yes Yes Yes! The best drink ever. Thank you for serving it!  Next time I'll try the bone marrow, and horse tartar.  They looked fantastic on the table next to ours."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place.  The duck tagliatelle stopped us dead in our tracks and no words were exchanged for a good 7 minutes.    She had never experienced food on such an extraordinary level before.  We closed our eyes and enjoyed the moment as excruciatingly delicious flavours played on our palette, enveloping us completely.  A true food high was achieved that night.  Perhaps the most visceral food experience I've ever had.  It was better than sex.   Black hoof, I don't know how you do it, but I thank you again."}
{"text":"Went there based on the great reviews on Yelp and honestly I still don't get the hype. The atmosphere was different from your typical restaurant as it was more hipster. The staffs were busy but they were attentive and helpful. That was the only good thing about this restaurant. The food was extremely overpriced for the small portion sizes and it didn't even taste good. Spent $50 for 2 people and we were still hungry.   The bone marrow for appetizer. It was small, salty and way too oily.   We got charcuterie board which is a small board with different pieces of sausage slices. It was $20+ for a few slices of small meat. Didn't taste different from what I could've gotten at metro for a fraction of the price. Totally not worth it.   We also got the beef tongue which was pretty tasty but it's $15 for a normal sized sandwich, with a bit of beef tongue and mustard.   I don't even eat that much and I walked away hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"If a cow ever got the chance, he'd probably eat you and everyone you care about.  Pigs?  They'll even eat your bones and the people you don't even care about.  Horses?  Don't even get me started.    It's not a live-and-let-live world, it's still eat-or-be eaten.  So get your ass (while it doesn't have any bite marks on it) to Black Hoof and do some damage."}
{"text":"What a great place.  I had read reviews about the black hoof and my friend and I decided to check it out.  Everything was great.  The food is different than most I've had before, but we were feeling adventurous.  We had the bone marrow which was great.  The sea salt definitely enhances the flavor.  We also had the horse tartar and the sweetbreads.  Both were delicious as well.  I especially liked the ketchup chips that accompanied the sweetbreads.  The service was just as good as the food.  Our server was very attentive, always filling up water glasses and gave us great descriptions and suggestions.  I would absolutely return to the black hoof on my next visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday for something fun and memorable and being here before I'd hope this meal would be interesting and impeccable.  Spicy Horse Tartare $16 - served with Hickory sticks and Hollandaise sauce with dill and mint. And I swear it was house made crisp and not hickory sticks the last time i came. It was a good combo but i somehow felt cheated of my money and by the end of it, very sick of the junk food  after taste. Yes, yes they change their menu every few months and i respect that, but hickory sticks, really?   Smoked Sweet Breads and Tuna - $18 - Sweet bread was fried perfectly and very chewy and delicious and tuna was sashimi with dill sauce. Slightly weird combo.   Bone Marrow $8 - Served in the open boned 4 pieces of toasts and plate of salt and chimichurri. Very delicious but between the two of us there were 4 toasts for us to share and 2 each was way more than our skinny figure could handle. Ok, i kid. More like our brain was beginning to shut off.  Foie Gras and Nutella $25 - Quite a combo, had to try it for the novelty of it. The foie was very fatty and on top of a soft piece of banana bread. Nutella was spread throughout the plate and sprinkled with nuts (?). The nutella could be more generous and proportionate with the foie. By the end of the dish, (which i have stopped eating by the way. Just too much fatty oil swimming inside already) there were no nutella left to compliment the foie and it tasted too duck like to be finished.   By the end of the meal i put down 95 dollars and came out 10 pounds heavier."}
{"text":"Love the Bone Marrow. Love the taco, Love the liver and onion. Love it!  I have been planning to go to this place for such a long time, that when I stepped into this cozy place, I almost felt I went to some local place of interest. I was thinking \" wow, so THIS is THE black hoof, people are talking about.  It looks to me like Au pied de cochon in Montreal. Open kitchen, little bistro, it took me only 1 second to like it.  We ordered House Cured Meat, Bone Marrow, Pork Carnitas Taco, Beef  Tendon & Grits, Smoked Sweetbread, another Pork Taco and Liver and Onion.  House Cured meat is just as good as it was described in yelppers' review. A good way to start your dinner. Bone Marrow is amazing. Spread it over bread, sparkle some sea salt on top, take a bite, SO GOOD, comfort food. I've read somewhere describe bone marrow and I couldn't agree more. \"It is just like butter, made of meat\"   I can't describe how good the pork taco was. Basically my friend and I stopped chatting and \"hmm\" after the first bite, there were a few second silence and he asked \" you wanna another of this ?\"  Totally~\"   Have to say that I am not a big fan of the Beef Tendon and grits. It was deep fried topped with t he hot sauce usually in Viet restaurant, and with Brie cheese. I just don't see those taste mixed together well.  Smoked sweetbread was okay. Although I kinda expected this kind of dish in Guu not in here. It was to the too salty side for me, but maybe because I was just drinking water for that night. If you have a beer, I think that is good to go with.  Live and Onion, the silk like texture of liver and the sweet taste onion. Can't ask for more. Still a little bit to salty for me and I had to pick up a piece of bread, but should be good to go with wine.   I have to say I enjoyed the service, did not have to ask for anything at all. They will refill your water, change your plate and fold napkin for you.   The only concern I am having will be the menu is not very long. Is it possible that they can make more amazing dishes in the future?  By the way, no credit card. Cash and debit only."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday at 7pm.  Patio was filled up, so ate inside at a table.  The staff was friendly and service was attentive.   Likes?  The finely sliced beef tongue sandwich, foie gras on brioche, and a pasta ravioli with sausage.  Had the roasted bone marrow, but was not feeling it.  I thought it would have the \"blood\" in the bone cooked up.   They make a mean margarita cocktail - had two of those.  Would I go back?  Maybe to hang on the patio and try their blood pudding next time.  Although that will be in a few months when my cholesterol count comes down."}
{"text":"If Yelp allowed half stars, I would give this 4.5...read on...  A friend suggested to try this place on a Friday night.  She had heard rave reviews of this place, and we decided it would be a great place to end our week for a relaxing girls' night out.  I'm a person made of immeasurable impatience.  Did the hostess just tell me 1.5 hr wait?  This is just after I made a turn off Dundas, and had no roads to turn off on, and had to go all the way up to College, get stuck in minor traffic, before finally coming down back to Dundas to find a parking spot....oh no she didn't!  OK, so I waited a couple more minutes until my friend arrived and went across the street for drinks, as the hostess suggested.  To their cocktail bar we went.  (OK, I thought, another way for them to make money...get me drunk, make me wait...and then....) HOW CUTE!  The decor had rustic cabinets, and the lighting, glass, and long bar, added a nice quaintness to it.  The name of my drink escapes me, but it was delicious.  They served different cocktails and martinis that The Hoof does not, which at least make it worth our while to enjoy appies and wait.  We also ordered duck wings to calm our stomachs - I highly recommend - please order if you're going to come here.  Meaty, well-seasoned, juicy, and finished with blue-cheese sauce.  Pure enjoyment.  After 1.5hrs of waiting, and a couple drinks later, we were finally given a table at the restaurant.  There, we ordered  a pisco sour each, pickles, of course the bone marrow, and the Foie and nutella...for the consistent good food, and the original combination of foie & nutella ON BANANA BREAD (triple YEAH!) that's where the 5 stars come in.  I hope my review was helpful to those seeking yummy food, but ensure it is a night with patience, and good company :)"}
{"text":"This place has been on my must try list for forever! When we learned that The Black Hoof will be closing its door at the end of the summer, we had to visit immediately.   The menu is for diners who want to try a little bit of everything and are adventurous eaters. Don't expect to order one thing off the menu as your main.  My favourite was the horse tartare! Amazing flavours and a great melt-in-your-mouth texture. Other notable mentions are the charcuterie and cheese boards, the spring carbonara and the asparagus salad. The bone marrow was far too salty for our table and the torchon had a great mouth feel, but did not have much of a taste.   You need to try this place before it closes!"}
{"text":"A friend brought me here for my birthday.  Don't let the not-so-glam decor fool you.. because you are in for a star-treatment... (Well, when it comes to the food anyways!)  Their alcohol selection is a little scant, but that may have changed since last July.  We had the Charcuterie Board to share, and the meats were all very savory.  I particularly like the prosciutto.  I ordered the Foie Gras en Brioche, and my adventurous DC ordered the Horse Meat Sammy.  I'm not going to lie to you, I looked at him funny when he told me he wanted to order that.  Horse meat is adventurous enough, let alone a horse meat tartare... Wouldn't that be a bit gamey?    The Foie Gras was really delicious.  The fruit preserve and maple syrup that topped the seared-to-perfection foie gras and brioche really made the dish.  For those of you who have read a few of my reviews by now, you should all know that I am the Queen of Foie Gras.  It is my passion, my joy - my life!    When the Horse Meat Sammy came I tried to resist giving it a try, but was convinced that if it didn't suit my palate that I could wash it down with the martini I ordered.  I figure, hey, what the heck, alcohol kills everything.  The Horse Meat Sammy came topped with a raw egg.  It was very tender and flavorful, not a HINT of gamey anywhere.  I liked the zing that the dill gave the dish.    I loved my experience at the Black Hoof, and it's sister restaurant across the street, the Hoof Cafe is equally to die for! If it's not already on your list of restaurants to try, grab a pen RIGHT NOW and write in big BOLD letterse, THE BLACK HOOF!"}
{"text":"I want to update my post.  I had another dining experience here and it was awesome... the 2 different dishes I had were the BEEF CARPACCIO and the SWEET BREAD... OMG...  The BEEF CARPACCIO was thinly melt-in-your-mouth-slices topped with shaved, yes, shaved frozen foie gras... it was ridiculously tasty.  The flavor of the beef was soaked up by the sweet foie gras, just melts in your mouth, topped of with some vino, delicioso.  The SWEET BREAD, which is not bread, oh no no, it is actually pork throat and neck.  It was lightly breaded and dipped in this delicious cream sauce.  Just the taste and the texture was crunchy and savoury, my favourite pairings for dinner.  I am loving Black Hoof more and more every time I go and experience something new.  I can't WAIT to go back!"}
{"text":"Dear Black Hoof,  It has been some time since I vacated Tawrana for the Big Apple and already the cravings for your comforting edibles have started to hit me like a flood as winter creeps forth. Granted I'm aware that NYC has a lot to offer in terms of gastronomical delights and exotic food adventures but will I ever find a suitable stand-in for my addiction to meat, salt and fat here? A casual yet happenin' enough place that takes me as I am in my slob uniform of flip flops, sweat pants and badly wrinkled graphic T's? Or a wonderful bar featuring a crafty mixologist by the name of Jen who makes slammin' cocktails depending on your choice of poison. Yea you know it, these of some of the reasons why I adore you so.   My SO scoffs at all the fuss I've made over you and mutters that I'm being melodramatic but pay no heed to him. I'm sure if he had a taste of your moist tongue sandwich spiked with tarragon mayo or your smokey, gorgeously fatty pork belly pastrami he would concede and relate.   How much do I adore you? I saved up my moolah and time during my last week up north to pay visit to you for my last dinner in Toronto. Armed with my good yelp friends Dale and Christine and my mother in-law in tow, we stormed your tiny establishment for a night of feasting and drinking. More specifically, I came back because I wanted to savour your charcuterie again and try your famed raw horse sammy. Needless to say, you did not disappoint our maws' as we tore into your charcuterie plate of pates, sausages and cured meat with the vigor of a defensive line. And the horse sammy-YES, it was every bit the sandwich of my dreams with its mind-blowing combination of diced raw horse, sliced onion, capers and hot sauce piled high on some rustic, crisp bread. The raw horse was a healthy crimson red and had a plush mouth feel not unlike tuna tartare. Outstanding. The egg yolk (a must for this dish) on top served to push this fantastic sammy further into the gastronomic stratosphere, enveloping the meat in a luxurious texture and binding the hodgepodge of flavours together. My MIL and I were politely fighting over the remnants of this dish at the end of the meal, narrowly staving off confrontation. I'm also pleased to report that you passed the MIL test, at the end of our gut-busting meal, the normally prim lady with the stoic reserve of a typical Scandinavian remarked brightly: \"oh MY, that was a good meal!\"  Alas, now we are miles apart and I am pinning and scheming for a return to the big smoke so I can enjoy your creative goods once again. When I boarded my flight out that fateful day, I pulled out the En Route magazine in front of my seat only to see your tongue on brioche sammich artfully and boldly displayed on the cover. Sadness! And now I hear that you are featuring pig's blood pasta and cherry-marrow beignets! Why do you tempt me so?! It may be months till we meet again!  Until then, keep on stuffin' and packin' the meat for me.  D"}
{"text":"The food here was really interesting! Beef tongue baos, horse meat tartare, Manhattan style cocktails. A sweet spot with a casual atmosphere if you're looking for some tasty yet unusual bites. The bone marrow was delicious and the charcuterie board definitely satisfied some cravings but Im not sure that I would come back here just because I wasn't really wow'd by anything and it was relatively expensive."}
{"text":"I cruised in here on a Saturday night and was able to get a spot right away.  Score, I could see what was going on in the kitchen.  I am not a big charcuterie guy, but this was definitely a tasty way to go.  I also liked the mustard that came with it.  I am undecided whether or not I should feel silly for paying so much for better cuts of deli meat.  Oh well, I have got bigger things to worry about.  The bone marrow was amazing, as advertised.  I wish Yelp Toronto let me upload a picture of the marrow, because it looked beautiful too."}
{"text":"If you like meat, and want to try new things - this is the place to go! The kitchen is tiny, but the food they pump out is absolutely incredible! This is not a place where you come for a full course dinner. Order various things from the menu, share, and savour every bite. A couple cocktails/beers on the side = perfect night out!  I've tried the following: Charcuterie/cheese board - LOVED IT! Bone Marrow Carnitas tacos.  Pickled vegetables.   I'm going to head back there just for the charcuterie! Maybe I'll try the tartare this time too..."}
{"text":"I've been here about three times before and remember it being much better than this time around. We had the bone marrow (not great), chicken fried quail (tasted like fried chicken, duhhhh), foie gras (pretty damn good), sweet breads (pretty damn good too), ravioli (underwhelming and very very small portion). Even though there were a couple great dishes, I don't think I'll be back here again to be honest. The wine was shitty (some French wine that was supposed to pair well with the food)...just overall a disappointing experience. The only thing I was happy about was that it was \"date night\" for the hubby and I."}
{"text":"TLDR version: Unusual and delicious food. Adventurous palettes only. Great service.  I recently went to The Black Hoof for one of the most amazing tapas style dining experiences ever.  The decor was like being inside a barn. Warm and cozy.  The service was great.  Onto the food:   Charcuterie - delicious select of salami, horse, capicola and ham. The mustard may have been home made. We got the side of pickles with it which was an assortment of veggies. The pickled cauliflower was surprisingly good.  Spicy Horse Tartar - the best horse I have ever had, and I like horse.  Pork Belly - they cooked it so the outside was crispy and the inside was warm and tender. The taro was a perfect addition.  Beef Heart with Oysters - thin sliced beef heart with oysters and asparagus. I was in heaven.   The only bad thing I have to say is the drinks were over priced. They were delicious however.  I would go back. With 2 drinks each, 140 for 2."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to check this place out while on vacation and boy am I glad to have gone. All the dishes we tried were super fun, well seasoned, and adventurous in the sense of their protein foundations. The horse tartare was a first for me and quite enjoyable. Crisp potato shreds and fresh herbs were a great compliment and certainly made a first time horse eater smile. As a CA native and resident, I am sad to report that foie gras is a no-go, but alas, this was Canada!! The chalk drawings are more than true on the walls of this place: \"Foie + Nutella = Best Friends\". I'd go as far as getting a tattoo of this equation to profess my love of the two together. Accompanied by a banana pain perdu, this dish was truly heavenly!!  Also of note, the super talented team here cooks on a home electric range!! WOWZA! I am even more impressed! Anyhoo... Thank you Black Hoof for a truly memorable first meal on my recent vacation to Toronto."}
{"text":"We tried the spicy horse tartare, roasted bone marrow, tendon and grits, pork belly with nori and enoki mushrooms, and tongue on brioche.   This gastropub will fulfill any savvy foodie's taste buds. The flavoring and pairing of the oddest fresh ingredients is so unexpectedly delicious. Each dish kept tasting better, and as full as we all were, we prayed the meal would not end. Moderately priced for a gourmet experience with no frills.   Our spicy horse tartare didn't have an overpowering acidic taste as most tartare do. In fact, the meat was fresh, light, and tender. Roasted bone marrow was richer than homemade butter and with topped with sea salt, the flavors couldn't have been more dangerously orgasmic. (Honestly I would've sucked the bone dry, but it might've been a tad inappropriate. Especially after just describing it as orgasmic.) Pork belly... well, need I say more after the words \"pork\" and belly?\" The piece of meat was cooked precisely to heaven and melted as soon as I bit into it. Finally, the tongue brioche. Growing up in New York City in a predominantly Jewish, Italian, and Irish neighborhood, I know good tongue so-to-speak. And OY VE does Black Hoof know good tongue!  The kitchen is wide open like a bar so you can see and smell your dish being cooked and plated. The selection of beers are mostly Canadian with an exception of a few imported American choices (i.e. Rogue Dead Guy). Interesting array of mixed cocktails as well for those interested in still spirits.   Tip: don't ask to split checks as it rubs the servers the wrong way, be ready to order several dishes with tasting portions, the menu is altered often so you may not get what I've listed, and don't be discouraged by how weird the dish may sound.  So to Black Hoof: Congrats on having the best restaurant, dare I say, in Canada. Continue creating outstanding dishes, ay?"}
{"text":"4.5 star review. Only because it doesn't take reseravations and we waited (a very tolerable) 1 hr across the street at the hoof cafe, and the bathroom smelt funny.   I knew it would be a wait, but we got there at 8pm and we were told there was a 1.5 hr wait. We went to the HOOF CAFE to WAIT across the street and thought we'd get an app here, along with some drinks. $8 for the BONE MARROW was amazing. decadent. 1 bone split in half covered with bread crumbs, raisins and some type of nut (not sure what) on a bed of apples and dandelions (the same thing, but onely one half was $9 at the black hoof, so I don't suggest getting it there)  After about 45 we got a call saying they had bar stools. we wanted to wait til we got a table. 15 mins later we got a call and headed over.   The place is small. Dim, and cozy. Loud, but okay to talk. Crowded, but not obstrusive. The daily menu was written on the wall, as were the drinks. and the Blonde Asian was so attractive, but I drank so much at the hoof cafe, I couldn't order another drink (shezchaun peppercorn, sake, rhubarb, lime juice). Next time.   We got a CHARCUTERIE PLATE ($16 small, good for 2 ppl) and included proscuitto, 'lardo' (buttery fat bacon type thing), horse (quite tasty), different types of salami, pork mousse (yum), rabbit (couldn't eat it without thinking of a poor white bunny), bread and pickled veggies.   I ordered the SOUTHERN FRIED SWEETBREAD $16 (recommended by our server bc I was deciding between the tongue on brioche, sweetbread, and the wild boar belly on rhubarb). I'm glad I chose it. Deep fried in a batter, it has the rich sweetbread taste, but a different texture than the normal gooey. Served on creamed collard greens, on a warm (not toasted) brioche. With some tangy hot sauce on the side. Not a fan of the hot sauce, but I can see how it could complement.   My friend ordered the FOIE GRAS ON TOASTED BRIOCHE ($22) What a big slab of foie gras. It was decedant as well.   Both dishes so filling, we couldn't have the daily dessert.   LOVE THIS PLACE. Will come again. Definately something different. I would recommend to come here the minute it opens to avoid line up."}
{"text":"Raw horse? Seriously?  I'm pretty sure that was the most terrifying and delicious thing I have ever eaten.   Everything we ate off that menu was great. It was three hours of eating some of the best tasting food in my life.   But I will never forget the Raw Horse Sammy. They even wrote horse in sauce on the bread to make sure you were reminded of what you were eating.   The next time I go back, I won't even hesitate to eat anything that seems \"strange\" to me off their menu. They have my full trust."}
{"text":"Realistically I'd have given 4.5 starts. Everything was great. The cocktails were well balanced and refreshing; I went with the little bird which was light and summer with a nice bourbon kick. the bone marrow was a generous potion and very rich. The house tartar was delicious. For the solo traveler they also offer half portions which is nice."}
{"text":"Was very upset by how we were treated at the Black Hoof. We initially wanted to go because of the rating on Yelp.   We walked in thinking this was a traditional Italian restaurant being in Little Italy. It is a Tapas style place and a little out of our price range. We were already being served water and so my girlfriend and myself ordered a beer and spiked cider for the troubles. The waitress was clearly upset that the expensive plates were not going to pile up on our bill. She questioned whether we wanted to be there because I had a Fodor's book out looking up a more traditional place. After serving our beers and telling her we were just there for drinks, she sad behind the bar and cleaned some dishes while starring at our table. She noticed we were finished and never came back to ask us for anything else. We immediately ask for another waitress to get us our check.   Very rude service and maybe it was just a bad experience but for the prices, I would still act nice for patrons who may not be running a $100 bar bill. It still cost us $20 for the two drinks. Look elsewhere for a classic Italian establishment and especially for better service."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Toronto my foodie girlfriend insisted that we try The Black Hoof. I'm glad she did because this place is fantastic. If you live in Toronto or end up any where near this place during a visit then do yourself a solid and check-check it.  - For starters we had the 3 cheese plate, chefs choice. Didn't even want to pair the jams or the provided nutbutter with the cheese since the taste of the cheese was so delightfully robust.   - The sweet breads were definitely tasty and there were several yummy vegetables included as well.  - My beer of choice - Kings Lager (GET SOME!)  The atmosphere alone deserves 5 stars...kudos to The Black Hoof!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences I've had. Ever. This was the highlight of our trip to Toronto (we are avid NYC foodies), and the hype is to be believed. The cocktails were delectable, service was on point (great recommendations, fast, friendly and honest), and rotating specials and regular food menu items were all just beyond this world. A little pricey but small plates are quite filling so it's not over the top expensive either. So totally worth it and we'll definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"The food here is quite intense for brunch but so delicious. Everything is amazing. Must order a side of pastrami if it's in the menu. And don't stinge, add foie gras to your dish. It's a big piece and done well."}
{"text":"Truth be told, I think Black Hoof is a little hit and miss (and I bet my friends are staring daggers at me through the Internet right now).   Been here 3 times with groups of 2, 3, and 6. ... sat at the bar, at the back, and by the front window.  Had the bone marrow every time.  First time was AMAZING- Never had better, delicious, hot, succulent.  Second time: a little cold, under cooked in certain places- not all that good... Third: very similar to first, but over salted.   Once (I think the first time?) there was pulled ox tail balls- basically the best individual thing I've ever eaten. Veg of the day has always been good.  Their specials are have consistently proved favourable, same with dessert.   The problems: 1)  salty, oh so salty- even when delicious, it's salty.  2) Quite pricey for what you get.  3) Drinks are ridiculously pricey- an orange curl doesn't justify a $17, 2oz cocktail.  Fourth and finally, Wait times during peak are incredible.   I'd do a 3.5/5 for my over all experiences. Dark and sexy, maybe Black hoof is just too suave for me.  Notes not affecting my opinion: Cash and Canadian debit only."}
{"text":"PICKY EATERS NEED NOT APPLY!     The Black Hoof was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. For those who are unfamiliar, this is a small restaurant that specializes in cooking the off cuts of animals (i.e heart, kidney, sweetbreads, horse etc.). I took a friend here for their birthday since we were both dying to try this place. Since we had heard that the portion sizes were smaller we decided to order 4 dishes to share (this is really the best thing to do at this restaurant, get 3-4 dishes to share). We ordered the following:   - Roasted bone marrow ($7): This was a pretty large bone that was very simply done, just roasted and served with salt and chimichuri on the side with bread. This was our least favourite dish of the night but it was still quite good. The bone marrow was nice and fatty, spread on a piece of toast with a little salt it tasted like butter (but meatier, which is to say, better). The chimichuri was good but I opted not to use it as I did not want to mask the flavour of the marrow.  - Next we had the charcuterie ($19): This is a pretty generous serving of their house cured meats, it had a few selections of salami, mortadella, capicolo, and chorizo, served with a side of grain mustard. The few selections of salami were made with things like beef heart and all had a pretty strong flavour. My favourite was the mortadella which brought back memories of sandwiches I used to take to school. The capicolo and chorizo were also quite good. This was a pretty generous serving and I was very impressed with the quality the meats. I was even more impressed that they are all made in house.  - Spicy horse tartar ($16): This was my favourite dish of the night. When it was presented to me I hesitated about eating horse and got visions of cute little sea biscuit running through my head. Once I had a bite I was glad I did because this was one delicious equine. The tartar was quite delicate and deliciously spicy; the flavour of horse was not much different than beef and was milder than I had anticipated. This was served with hickory potato sticks which provided a nice smoky flavour and a much needed crunchy element. The hollandaise on this dish was very creamy. It was topped with pickled onions which gave it a sour element and little bits of fresh mint which gave it a much needed herbal freshness. Overall this dish was beautifully executed and had the perfect mix of tastes and textures. - The last dish we had was the pork tacos ($11): This was 3 small tacos served on a soft tortilla. The pork was very tender and juicy (kind of like a pulled pork consistency). It had avocados which provided a delicious, creamy texture. Served with a side of pork rinds for a little crunch and hot sauce in a small bottle for some heat. Again this dish provided a good mix of tastes and textures and was very well balanced.   I would seriously recommend this place to any foodie in Toronto. They sure know how to execute their dishes and provide you with some funky dishes (cannot wait to go back and try the foie gras and nutella dessert!). It is a little pricey (4 dishes and 2 beers ran about $90 with tax and tip) but you will have a good meal. They also have an extensive cocktail menu (I stuck to beer, of which they had 4 high quality craft beers on tap). The service was very friendly, we ordered all our dishes at once but they were brought out one by one and in a great order, at no point in the meal did we feel rushed but rather I felt we were encouraged to take our time which is rare for a busy little restaurant. This place takes no reservations and has weird hours so make sure you look at their hours before you go. We got there at 6:30 and were seated right away, it really did start to fill up so if you go later I would anticipate a wait. This is definitely a must try in Toronto."}
{"text":"If I lived in Toronto, I'd gain a million pounds from eating here.  We traveled from Milwaukee to give this place a try before the close at the end of the summer. It did not disappoint. A lot of the reviews (positive and negative, it appears) mention the bone marrow, and they should. It's so good. Bone marrow is essentially meat butter, though, so unclear as to how that could be bad. Furthermore, you should have a shot of bourbon with a bone marrow luge. It'll be the best shot of bourbon you've ever had.  I DIGRESS. The eclairs were to die for -- the mix of tangy rhubarb and pate was ridiculous. We had three rounds for the table (I promise there was five of us it wasn't just me ok). The mystery wine turned out perfectly for 2/2 bottles, and the foie dessert rounded out everything.  A: Yes the bread service costs money but like no s**t? Don't skip on the butter. Eat the butter. B: Get horse tartare even if you think it's weird it's delicious weird, just eat it. C: Especially in these final months, MYSTERY WINE. Have an idea of what you're looking for and let the staff do the rest. D: Maybe don't be in a rush because perfection takes time, ok?  I really enjoyed this meal."}
{"text":"My family and I went here mostly because when it was on the Layover with Anthony Bourdain, it looked amazing. I came in a little scared that I would not be able to eat anything since I am not as adventurous as the rest of my family.   The restaurant is small, and it is really intimate with the seating as well as the lighting. The food is small plates which is supposed to be ideal to share, but in reality everyone gets like one bite. But the serve does space everything out for you so that you aren't overwhelmed with all this food at the table which I thought was really nice.   We started off with the charcuterie, which had chorizo and other great things, and it came with crusty bread. Next we got the bonemarrow which came with salt and chimichurri sauce. I did not have this but it looked really good.   We also got squid ink pasta, pork tacos, beef heart, buffalo mozzarella, and foie gras with waffles.   Everything was amazing. We actually got two of the pork tacos since I liked them so much. To us the foie gras with waffles was one of the best things on the menu, and my family wished they had gotten more of that. All the food tasted really fresh.   Our waiter was really nice, and talkative. He was really attentive since I drink water a lot. It was a really nice place. We would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"The menu was out of this world, I wanted to try everything. I love exploring new foods, and will jump at the chance to experience something I've never had before, and the black hoof offers you this opportunity in spades. I can't say I've had most of what I ordered anywhere else, so it's hard to compare, but I enjoyed every last thing I ordered thoroughly. The staff was also amazing and very helpful with recommendations! When I'm back in Toronto I'm definitely hitting this place up again for round two."}
{"text":"this has remained my favorite restaurant in the city for years.   the addition of nori snacks to the horse tartare is my fucking life. foie and waffles was better than foie and pancakes. but me not care."}
{"text":"I highly enjoy traveling, but it has made me so acutely aware of how dependent I am on my phone. Take away my phone with my yelp app and google maps, and I've never felt so helpless about where to go. Only a slight exaggeration.  We had forgotten to write down the exact address, with only a 80% certainty it was on Dundas, so we just started walking west hoping to find this somehow. When we did find this place, we sat down with a huge grin and a high-five, and the waitress commented on our enthusiasm :)  Okay back to the review. This place is open late, no reservations, and no credit cards. With the clientele and staff, it really feels like we were in Brooklyn. Really cutesy ambiance, with menu and drinks written on chalkboards on the walls. Also an open kitchen area.  It was odd that we had to pay for bread..never had that happen before. The hoof-made prosciutto was delicious and not overly fatty/salty. Also a large portion. The pickles are deceiving, as they are not pickles in the traditional sense, but rather a small sampling of small pickled vegetables. The bone marrow was good, but more oily than normal. The duck liver mousse and tuna crudo were decent. The pork belly was really good.  Good place to go, I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"top spot i went to in toronto. hands down. walked in solo on sunday night which is ALWAYS dangerous. ive had alot of bad meals at great restaurants on sunday nights. Ian helped me out first and challenged me that they make the best manhattan known to man. game on. so i tried it and man it was so fantastic. i tried comparing it to other manhattans ive had and i realized it just was a bit more unique and the house made bitters really made it something i hadn't had before. so good it would give wilson and wilson or bourbon and branch a run for its money.   food wise i put it in the hands of Jenn. i gave her free reign and she went out of her way to give me an incredible experience. the pork belly soup was incredible, delicate, flavorfull, REALLY balanced in the broth. the beef tonque sandwhich was suppppper incredible. i also had the fried sweetbreads with little potatoes, radishes and mache greens (could be wrong). that was incredible too...the charcuterie plate was ridiculous. not even going in detail. just have it.    thanks so much to ian and jenn and the rest of the staff. suppper awesome folks very special place and very tasty food.... check out their bar across the street too."}
{"text":"I can't believe I did not write a review for the Black hoof yet.  I went on a good evening, the sun was still up, there was no line ups and we were seated at the back where the patio was. It's a nice space with a few tables. Kind of romantic.   We tried almost everything on the menu at that time, and we were still kinda hungry after, but the bill sure adds up!   This place is worth a try, but don't come really hungry, it doesn't really fill you up, cause you didn't come here to eat bread, so don't have too much of that.  if you want something different and unique, come here, but expect a large bill when your done, I would come back again."}
{"text":"LOVED THIS place to pieces for dining and brunch..   Only able to fit small parties ..  i had come for a table of 2 and table for 3 before and find that anymore than that... would definitely require reservation and not even sure if they can accomodate parties greater than 6   Dining highlights: Bone marrow, horse taretare (so flavorful , not even gamey because I usually hate lamb and venison), dessert = foie gras waffle with butter nut squash WAS SO DELISH, Who knew that it can make such a wonderful pairing or sweetness and just enough saltiness? Perfect balance without being too rich!! great for sharing dish.   Brunch -- I loved sweet bread and waffle and we also ordered something else and added foie gras... WHO LOVES foie gras for breakfast? ME ME ME!!  You know why I loved it so much as well (besides from the food) --- I never had an empty glass of water... I was so impressed that we were served so nicely , we just had to give a great tip to our waiter.... maybe because the restaurant was so small that our waiter was more attentive to me.. or maybe because he really was just attentive and valued good service because I was extremely thirsty on that spring day and I drank the water every moment I could and I couldn't be happier that my server never once had me ask him to fill it (he just saw my glass was half full and poured it)... he probably thought I was like dehydrated or something!"}
{"text":"Wonderful cuisine and service that really understands what they're serving."}
{"text":"Black Hoof definitely took some time for me to derive my analysis.  If I went without those deep thoughts, I would rate it A-OK simply from what I ate.  That of course due to my ethnic background and open-minded personality.  If you wish to continue to read a more thorough review, please read on.  Charcuterie Platter(Large/$25.00), includes several preparations of some distinct variety of Animals from your pre-school book.  Horsey, Duckie, Bambie, Piggy, Moo Cow.  It's an item that is hard to say it's not good and I'm not a Charcuterie expert or even a regular, so this is like any other Cold Cut to me.  Something that applies to the above and below is the portion size.  If you believe pure Carnivores will love this place, it could be 1/2 true.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but Carnivores typically are BIG eaters as well.  Don't bring a BBQ meat eater here, they'll eat you out of your next month's paycheque.  That Charcuterie serves 1 Carnivore or 2 Carnivores that are willing to share(?).  You might lose a limp if your hand gets in the way, as the Meat Eater will fork your Hand thinking it's part of a specialty Charcuterie item. (-0.5 Star)  Foraged Mushroom with Duck Heart had a simple clean sauteed preparation which is a great way to enjoy Foraged Mushrooms and the Duck Heart had good texture.  This reminds me of a Cantonese dish, maybe with Duck Gizzards which has similar bite/texture.  Have you thought about what they use to pour your always full glass by that kind gentleman?  It's a narrow neck Bottle, which makes it easy to pour from a small spout and less likely to have major accidents on their customers in this small space.  Other restaurants tend to use Jugs which is easier for them.  This along with other parts of our service this night deserves +1 Star.  Roasted Bone Marrow($9.00) is best at it's simplest preparation and that was what was offered here and I especially enjoyed the bites closest to the bottom of the Bone.  Those parts which has a slight meat attached which gets a great roast has enough saltiness to escalate the flavour, no salt needed.  No Bread needed either, although it comes with.  Raw Horse Sammi($22.00) is same as above that I probably liked it without the Bread.  I like the texture of the meat but what I realize for meat is that in a Tartare application, it doesn't seem to be as filling therefore you're given Bread for the sandwich.  (+0.5 Star) since it's a rare item that I've always wanted to experience previously."}
{"text":"While our uber ride to this place took longer  than expected, it was well worth the wait. We arrived for Friday dinner. When we arrived around six or so, the place was relatively empty, but quickly filled up as time went on.   We ordered two cocktails to start (i.e. The tea cocktail as well as the bourbon one). I thought they were okay.    In terms of food, we ordered the charcuterie plate, bone marrow and the fois gras French toast. They do recommended ordering extra toast for the charcuterie plate so that you can pair the meats and sauce with it. However, toast does come with the bone marrow which may be enough (no need to pay the extra $3).   The charcuterie plate was amazing. A diverse range of meats on bread with mustard really hit the spot. I'm not a huge fan of bread, but this dish was amazing overall.   The bone marrow was equally as good. The sauce plus the marrow and the bread proved to be a great combination. We used leftover bread and sauce for the charcuterie plate as well. This was also very good.  Last but not least, the fois gras French toast. This was an amazing end to the meal. I highly recommend ending off with this dish. It was sweet but also very delicious.    Overall, the general vibe of the place was quite vibrant. We also had great service. Since it does get full towards the night, I'd recommend coming early (around 6ish) or coming later with reservations. It's quite easy to see why this place has the ratings it does and I would not hesitate to come in again and try the fois gras French toast and charcuterie plate.  Im also curious to try the duck fingers and horse tartare when I return. This is easily in my top 3 favorite restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"I'm EXTREMELY picky when it comes to brined / smoked meat. I frequent several delis all over North America and am frequently disappointing. The Tongue on Brioche was hands down most delicious brined meat i have EVER tasted. Two thumbs up for injecting your tongue with saline solution everyday for a week. DELIS TAKE NOTES."}
{"text":"When I began making plans for where to eat during my recent Toronto trip, the first restaurant on my must-hit list was The Black Hoof, famous for its offal. Who could pass up roasted bone marrow, foie & nutella, and spicy horse tartare?  As it turns out, lots of people.  I'd rented a car so I could more easily get from my hotel in Richmond Hill (where my convention was) to downtown Toronto, which meant I'd have plenty of room when it came time to hoof to Hoof Thursday night. One of my friends was in the moment she heard about the menu, but as for those other spots in the car? They turned out to be not so easily filled. Nearly every person I asked to join us gave me one of those \"Are you out of your mind?\" looks, and said things like, \"Yeah, right\" or \"Suuuure ... \"  Luckily, I eventually bumped into two other friends who proved to be as enthusiastic about offal as I was.  The Black Hoof stays open until 1:00 a.m. Thursday nights, so we felt safe arriving at around 10:45 p.m., though the note on its site, \"Our hours are just a little odd/Check 'em twice just to be safe\" did have me a little nervous. Not sure where we would have parked at a more civilized hour, but by that time the neighborhood was deserted enough that we could squeeze into the church parking lot next door. The joint was still jumping, though most of the patrons were at the bar. We were led to a table in the back beneath the menu, and began the process of deciding ... well ... not really WHAT we wanted to eat, but what we thought we COULD eat, because we would have been willing to try everything.  First up, a large selection of house cured meats. My favorite of the spread was the pig heart sausage, which was so rich I felt as if I was chewing on life itself.  Next up, the roasted bone marrow, which was the point I realized that others listening in nearby with eyes closed might have been confused into thinking they were overhearing an orgy, so loud and enthusiastic were the moans and groans.  Our next dish--the smoked sweetbreads and tuna--was attacked and devoured so quickly it wasn't until I fell back in my chair that I realized I hadn't snapped a photo. But the dark smokiness of the sweetbreads and the lightness of the tuna contrasted perfectly.  Next up, the dish that I think most frightened those friends who were unwilling to join me--the horse. I was worried--by virtue of the word \"spicy\" in the description of the dish--that it would be VERY spicy, and mask the flavor of the meat, preventing me from learning what horse tasted like. But it turned out to be only mildly spicy, and I found out that horse tartare didn't, to my untrained palate, taste very much different than steak tartare. The experience for me was more one of texture than flavor, and the soft ground meat worked well with the bed of crispy potatoes on which it sat.    Our penultimate dish was the Foie and Tongue, which was mounded between thick slices of brioche and held together by a skewer with pickles at both ends. All of the dishes were sensual experiences, but this was the star of the evening. I think it was during this course, when the waitress dropped by to see how we were doing, that Jim whispered to her, \"I love you.\" I've never had better tongue, so soft and delicate that no chewing was required, as if each salty slice ate itself. This was the course during which the slurping and moaning reached its height.  We closed with the most unusual dish--foie and nutella. All of us thought ... what's up with that? But as a sign on the wall indicated, those two ingredients are BFFs.  Though it doesn't get billing in the name of the dish, it's served with warm banana bread between the foie and nutella, and when I popped my first taste into my mouth, the (seared, I believe) foie exploding, well ... let's just say a groan burst uncontrollably from my lips creating a sound I don't think I've ever emitted outside the bedroom.  If all this gives you the idea that our visit to The Black Hoof was an extremely sensual experience, you'd be right. When we were done, I felt ready for a cigarette.  And I don't even smoke.  My only regret is that there was no way we could possibly have eaten anything more. And so, no blood sausage and popcorn, no oxtail and scallops. Those will just have to wait for a future trip. And you can be guaranteed that if there is one, The Black Hoof will be a part of it.  I can't see visiting Toronto without at least one meal there. What would be the point?"}
{"text":"No reservations here so be prepared to wait! However, the wait is not too bad as Montauk i just up the street and there are a bunch of cute stores to look at.   The food selection is quite limited but really forces you to try new things. We had the horse tartare (how can you not), the blood sausage parppadelle, and charcuterie (of course). Everything was good even though we didn't manage to finish the tartare (it was a bit too adventurous for me) but the owner was very accommodating and tried her best to really show us that you really can eat every part of the animal ... ha.  The wine selection is superb as are the cocktails. Do come prepared to drink and be merry."}
{"text":"So I have decided to leave Yelp.  Sorry guys, it was bound to happen.  From now on, I will be eating my meals exclusively with Susan C. and she will be writing 'our' reviews on behalf of the both of us!!!  Goddamn she really knows how to make my reviews look like donkey dick (a new Black Hoof menu item perhaps?).  This being said here is my review.  1) What Susan C. said. 2) Horse sammy -- probably the best thing ever. 3) It is only CASH or debit ONLY. 4) Need a visual tour of my visit? Try here: http://iambidong.blogspot.com/2009/10/black-hoof-food-in-all-its-glory.html 5) Fuck vegetarians.  That is all."}
{"text":"I came here again.  Same positives, same negatives. Portions are on the slim side.  Drinks are expensive.  A very hipster environment.  Oh and they have a drink bar STILL across the street.  Which means if its time to eat, you might have to play a bit of frogger to get to your table while you wait.  However lets talk about the food.- i went previous to high end restaurants with amazing views, paid similar prices to what I did here.  Great views.  HOWEVER, I could not compare the two when it comes to food.  Food is the star of the place... using unique parts of the animal and creating an interesting experience for the tongue.  There are no great views, only creative food and good service, which is why i felt like rewriting my review for this place."}
{"text":"Pretty damn expensive! But very nice...even for someone who doesn't eat meat. That said, gird your loins for a dinner of not-much if you come here and don't eat meat.   Servicey info for vegetarians: I ate bread, olives, pickles, and the asparagus with sauce gribiche and hazelnuts and was pleased but hungry after I left. There's an option of a cheese board for $19 but my friends were all content with the meatier options and I didn't want to press the issue. Of the whole meal I was happiest with the pickles--they were really amazing. I'd love to get a recipe for those spicy wax bean pickles."}
{"text":"-Visited here because of Anthony Bourdain-  First night into Toronto, the man friend begged me to have this place be his first meal.  We came in on a Thursday late at night so the Restaurant was near empty. The restaurant is very small, dim, and simple. I noticed they used an old electric stove (the one with swirls that you see in older apartments) to cook the food and they don't have menus...just two  black chalkboards (so if you're blind at night, please bring your glasses).   We ordered:  Beef Tongue Brioche (3/5) - This was heavy but delicious! It tasted like a pastrami sandwich Bone Marrow (5/5) - Best bone marrow I've had...none in California that tasted like here! Oxtail Pappardelle (4/5) - I would definitely get this again! The oxtail was braised perfectly and the nut crumble on top went surprisingly well with it! Pork Jowl and Clams (4/5) - I love pork...so I automatically love this dish. They serve it with spicy pickled cucumber (korean style) and it pairs so well with the fatty pork :o)  I regret not trying the horse tartare...but I am not that brave yet.   Overall, this restaurant was probably the best thing in Toronto....because everywhere else was average at best... Cali food is the best after New York :) Sorry, big T..but not sorry ~"}
{"text":"Very good food here.  Possibly the best Bone Marrow in the city.  The charcuterie plate is well done.  The tongue on brioche is very good and the pork tacos were also very good.   Of all the things we ate, we tried to figure out what would be the signature dish of this restaurant and nothing sprung to mind; which is kind of strange because usually a restaurant has 1 or 2 things that really are the outstanding items that rise above other restaurants similar items.  The charcuterie plate is really good, but I think Richmond Station is better.  The Pork tacos are good, but I think Grand Electric are better, etc, etc...  I'm not saying that anything was bad - in fact, everything was very good and I don't think anybody would be disappointed by anything on the menu.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Sorry black hoof - i'm not impressed.  So both myself and hubby had been wanting to visit here for a while. From reviews, friends word of mouth.. all that. So on hubby's birthday we decided finally to visit and see what's it about.  First impression: not so great. We were only 5 minutes before their open time, and the staff were standing around just chatting but we are told to wait outside. Well.. I'd appreciate it if we were invited in to sit and wait, it is january and it was cold. We stood there and watched their staff for 5 minutes through the window. We almost walked to another restaurant instead, but really wanted to give this place a chance cuz of the reputation.  We had the bone marrow - the only dish that was ok. it came with a green sauce and salt to sprinkle on top. it's different and i've never had it like that. I asked to save the bone for my dog and they wrapped it in foil for me later. yay.   the lamb tartare was ok, not great. again since i've never had it - the lamb meat was a bit tougher than the usual beef tartare and I guess it was just good to try.   The last dish, foie and french toast, was just terrible. the flavors didn't go, very expensive, and incredibly small portions.   Anyways, I'm not impressed, I'm not gonna run back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"On a chilly winter day, I was once found loitering on Dundas Street. Yep. Pacing up and down, tracing my steps on the same square block over and over. And over again. When asked what I was up to by some daring strangers, I laughed and haughtily replied, \"Waiting for The Black Hoof to open, that's what!\"  No reservations here, you see, so there is a method to my stalking madness. I don't like being turned away with a 1-hour wait, so I have no shame about lining up early for the cured meats and braised entrails.  The Black Hoof opened my eyes to the world of offals. I first learned of it in 2009 and it was every bit as good as I imagined. We sat at the bar, which had a 1920s vintage cocktail feel to it. No menus, just chalkboards. Ugh, yes, they're one of those place. Don't worry, the chalkboard isn't too complicated here. You only need to remember to let your waiter or bartender lead you through it and you won't be disappointed. We started with the charcuterie plate, probably the best one I've had in recent memory. All of it was like butter - melting and salted and just overflowing with happiness. The roasted bone marrow was something else. The sea salt added a remarkable touch. The veal sweetbreads were fried with some greens and a creamy sauce, one of the tastiest dishes of the evening. But it was the foie gras and nutella that took my breath away - made me sit up and say, \"Hey, this place is pretty awesome.\"  All the while, there's hustle and bustle, hipsters, candles, laughter, banging and clanging. And the owner, dressed demurely in a string of pearls, watching, helping and keeping a keen eye on the frenzied operations. A cool place. Just remember the recipe for having a good time: keep your expectations low, your appetite high, and your wallet wide open. This place isn't cheap!"}
{"text":"One of the restaurants we were most excited to visit in Toronto.  Absolutely lives up to its reputation. The food is incredible and the atmosphere is hip and cozy. We loved everything we ordered: head cheese and foie gras,  tartare, and bone marrow. Betting that everything else on the menu is amazing too."}
{"text":"I've gone for brunch there. The food there is very unique, I recommend trying the bone marrow eggs. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu! The place is a little small, so keep that in mind if you plan on going with big groups."}
{"text":"Really small space, good ambiance. Kitchen is tiny but they crank out the dishes.  The alcohol program was a bit lacking for me. Beer and cocktails were boring. Stronger wine list but a touch pricey.  Big menu, but with a table of four you can order the whole thing. The portion sizes are really small, almost two small to split between two people let alone four. That's my major complaint, portion size.  Execution was on point, no duds, mostly winners.  Eggplant pasta was great. You can try horse tartate here, you have to do it.  This place needs some tweaks but I'd come back and potentially be a regular."}
{"text":"This place definitely lived up to all the hype! I tried the Earl Grey tea with liquor (I forgot exactly what the name was) and the Caesar and they were both delicious. The tea was interesting as I've never had tea with alcohol before - pure genuis!   We had the bone marrow (of course!), pork tacos, and the charcuterie platter. Everything was scrumptious! The bone marrow came with sea salt, which I've never seen before. That brought out the taste of the bone marrow as opposed to eating it on it's own. My favourite part of the charcuterie platter was the pistachio mortadella and the pate, which is surprising because I hate pate lol   I was a little apprehensive to try the tongue as I don't like the texture but after seeing it ordered by a few people while I was there, I think I'm going to have to come back to try that - and the horse tartare.   I have to mention that the service here was awesome. Although it was very packed the entire time, I never felt like I was rushed to finish my meal and get out like some other trendy places I've been to (ahem*grand electric*ahem). Our waitress consistently asked us how our meal was going the entire time, but not in an intruding way. Overall I was very happy with my experience here and do plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"Black Hoof bears a great resemblance to \"animal restaurant\" from LA. Creative tapas-style meat-centric dishes that would take your tastebuds to an exciting roller-coaster ride. This restaurant is by far my favorite restaurant in Toronto. To experience their full menu, I highly suggest going there with a group with no less than 4 people, you won't regret it.  Horse tartare (5/5) - This was superior to any beef tartare I've had so far. The meat was extremely delicate, sort of reminded me of tuna.   Bone marrow (4/5) - Again, this was probably the best bone marrow I've had. I was actually not a fan of bone marrow, because I felt they were too fatty and lack an inherent flavor. Somehow the bone marrow from the Black Hoof made me view it in a new light.  Beef Heart & XO (5/5) - Their beef heart was cooked rare (when I say rare, I mean half-raw rare). Some people may have problems with it but I've had raw beef heart sashimi in Japan and it was mindblowingly good. I'm convinced that this is the best way of eating beef heart.  Liver (4/5) - A solid dish, but it did not blow my mind  Tripe Karaage (4.5/5) - Growing up in an asian family, we ate tripe quite often. However, I was surprised at the fact that the texture of this tripe was nothing like the tripes I've had previously. It wasn't as \"crunchy\" yet the flavor was still there.  Fried sweetbreads (3.5/5) - Not the best sweetbreads I've had, but still fairly decent.  Tongue on brioche (5/5) - This dish was constructed similar to a roast beef sandwich, but what surprised me the most was that the texture of the tongue. Normally, tongues should be quite firm and even a little crunchy. Their tongue was thinly sliced, extremely soft and tender, paired with the richness of the brioche, this was the ultimate roast beef sandwich.  Foie and pancake (5/5) - Foie gras goes well with sweet sauce, but these guys took it to another level by making it a desert! It had a nice balance between sweet and savory, and their foie gras was also cooked to perfection. Don't bother with the other foie gras dish they have here (the other one is terrine I believe), get this."}
{"text":"I really like this place Good food, cool environment and they rarely ever disappoint . This is our go to place for any down town Toronto dates. If you're looking for high quality fine dining experience at casual dining prices; this is your place."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of coming here a couple of weeks ago and I've been keen on going back since. We ordered the horse tartare, the foie gras, the tartine, the pork jowl, ox tail parpadelle, sweetbreads and bone marrow. Do not skip ordering the sweetbreads, the parpedelle and the dish with the foie gras and liver!   Prices are a bit steep so I would even recommend having a snack before arriving if you're starving to death. This is the kind of place that's great to go with a group of people and share plates and have a great time. Not for the faint of heart and do not bring anyone who is squeamish!!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh off the latest Enroute Magazine accolades as one of the best new restaurants in Canada....I finally made my way over here. Finally.  This charcuterie movement really appeals to the carnivore in me and this place certainly adds a different dimension to the Toronto food scene.  Place was packed in late Sat night but we split a table up front within 15 mins. Better to be lucky than organized I guess.  Large board charcuterie....variety is the spice of life and this lineup was delicious. Organized from mild to strong flavors, various house-made cuts aside from the chorizo, served with a side dish of pickled veggies...melt-in-your mouth goodness, duck prosciutto, duck liver mousse, sopressata flecked with blueberries and foie. Great starter.   The raw horse sammy - just like a great smooth steak tartare, the shallots, capers and yolk complimented the tangy spice of the hot sauce mayo.   Ox-tongue cappilletti - small, al dente blanched, tortellini bites, clarifying and delightful.  Sweetbread on polenta - interesting, a more textured breaded nugget, slightly heavy on the coating, but still tasty.  The accolades are warranted, this place caters well to the carnivorous gourmand. Despite all this, I'm not sure I would come here to dine repeatedly but more to gnash on a few meats."}
{"text":"With 4 other yelpers, I attended last night this high temple of meat.   On entering the sanctuary my wife and I were greeted by the other sacrificial lambs. On the wall hung black tablets outlining what torture we could be subjected to. Our 5 person altar was soon approached by a priestess who outlined the measure of the pain we were about to endure. She, however, gave us choices as to the types of gastronomic purgatories we could enter. We played our role and responded by ordering sweet, sweet tantalizing tortures from the menu.  The large charcuterie board (or was it a rack?) was a symphony of sinfully displayed meats. They were arranged in order from milder to strongest. All the charcuteries were home made with the exception of the chorizo. They were all delectable especially the mousse, and the pate (which was a lot like a good rillettes de caen). An offering of fresh bread flanked the viands.  We followed this up by torture disguised as oven- roasted marrow filled bones. These were decadently delectable and oh so good.  We were almost speechless at the goodness, but thankfully next came Tongue en brioche. It almost looked like a pastry. It was tender, tasty, moist, and totally awesome.  And what would be gastronomical torture without a horse? Ask Sancho Panza (he used a mule?). The Horse Tartare finally loosened the lips of one of the diners to say \"this is the best sandwich I ever had\". I concurred and thus we had achieved full penance, after that confession.  A couple of other diners proceeded to the bread pudding, and I was told it was awesome. At long last the high priest presented us with the reckoning: a reasonably priced meal. We had expiated our hunger, and achieved sweet penance.   All you sinners out there, get thee to the Black Hoof. Salvation awaits!  Its not a five star but its certainly 4.5!"}
{"text":"Dinner on a friday.  Foie mi-cuit with cranberry sauce and pickled mustard seed served with toasted brioche.  Great; really nothing I could conceivably complain about.  Bone marrow with chimichurri was a nice twist.  Bruléed blood pudding was pretty awesome, both in terms of creativity and execution.  It was somewhat sweet, with a relatively firm texture (i.e. compared to a custard), the blood flavor was very subtle.  Fine bits of crispy fried onion added texture as well as a bit of salt.  Pear, cubed and stewed, as well as dried thin slices added a pleasant fruitiness and more complementary textures.  Suckling-pig belly brado was a bit of a flop: soggy pieces of belly in a boring broth.  Tongue with pickled mustard seeds, cornichons, and what I believe was celery.  Very tender, with very mild tongue flavor.  The pickled celery was surprisingly sweet, in a good way that complemented the tongue.  Ricotta and brain ravioli with artichoke was kind of boring, though the artichoke did contributed a nice chewy texture and sour flavor.  Ultimately, I blame myself for ordering pasta at charcuterie!  \"Smoked\" sweetbreads (which were actually lightly battered and fried, perhaps they were smoked earlier!) were served with a white sauce, with potatoes and radish.  They were pretty tasty, consistency was buttery yet firm.  For dessert, I had the apple cake with slices of frozen crème fraîche (genius!), caramelized apple, and crumble.  Apple was incorporated in three different forms: cooked apple, apple sauce, and apple \"confit.\"  Normally, \"deconstructed\" desserts are among my pet peeves, since re-constructing each perfect forkful requires significant effort, which, I feel is the chef's job!  Notwithstanding, this \"cake\" was pretty awesome, with great complementary flavors, textures, and temperatures.  I still would have liked it better fully assembled.  The service deserves a special mention: they have many servers who replace plates and cutlery with incredible efficiency.  One one occasion, we even had two servers refreshing our table simultaneously, swooping in from opposite sides. Unnecessary, but impressive.  Overall, a positive dining experience at a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"The menu is quite unique - from bones to organs to muscles. I hear that it is normally pretty busy and they do not take reservations. I came on a Sunday night and was lucky enough to get a table right away. We ordered the bone marrow, horse tatare, tongue on brioche and foie pancakes. I've had better bone marrow but everything else was good and it was a good experience with these unique items offered. If you like more of a sweet taste then the tongue on brioche and the foie & pancakes are the right dishes for you!"}
{"text":"I guess I picked the right place to go for my one dinner in Toronto!!! Oh la la - it did not disappoint - thanks fellow Yelpers. I arrived around 10 and there was a half hour wait. The hostess told me I would be sitting with another single who was waiting across the street in the cocktail bar. I, too, went to wait and enjoy a wonderful rye Manhattan (opened my eyes as I am a bourbon kinda gal). About 20 minutes later Justin (my new friend) and I were seated. A huge shout out to Justin who was willing to share dishes with a perfect stranger. Eureka! My menu horizons increased dramatically!!! We started with the horse tartare per everyone's recommendations. It did not disappoint. After I got over the novelty of eating horse meat I truly enjoyed it and the sauce that accompanied it - although I did not fine it particularly spicy as billed. The meat was sweet and the sauce balanced it perfectly. Onto the bone marrow. I just made bone marrow a week or so ago  (the bones I purchased were labeled \"dog bones\") but this was perfectly done and the chimmichurra pesto was a nice foil to the rich marrow.  Tongue sandwich next. I was worried that might put me over the top (and there was more to come). The meat was sliced perfectly thin and it was superb. I don't remember any sauce on it but there didn't need to be as the meat was so good. It was not a heavy sandwich (thanks to the brioche roll) so I had room to continue. Next up: smoked sweetbreads. Delectable. Served under a salad. I did not taste much smokiness but since I am not a big fan of smoked meat, which was fine by me! Justin made a decision to order one more thing and thank goodness he did. The foie gras with banana pan perdu sitting on top of Nutella (yep - that's right, Nutella!) with puddles of a sherry gastrique. I had one bite and nearly swooned. Desert-o-licious!!!!!!!!!!!! The food outshone the atmosphere which was cozy. There was a small kitchen area at the end of the bar (where I was seated) and I was amazed watching the cooking that was going on in front of me on an non comercial (electric) stove. Impressive. Left about 12:30 with nary a regret (except that there was not a Black Hoof in Boston)!"}
{"text":"I called ahead to book a reservation and the host was really helpful and nice.  I really enjoyed the mulled cider.  Personally, I'm not a big fan of the blood sausage.  The texture was not my cup of tea and felt much too heavy. Pork carnita tacos had a great balance of flavour and crispiness. I would definitely order this again."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to try this place after watching it on Anthony Bourdains show. Having come all the way from Australia I was keen to try something different, got the bone marrow. Very nice with the bread and condiments on the side. I also got the scallop and Ox tail. That was my fave!!! So succulent and juicy , the tacos were okay. The pork was slightly dry in parts. The charcuterie board was delicious and definitely one of the best I've ever had! Would love to go again if I was in Toronto and be a bit more adventurous in my ordering."}
{"text":"5 stars for the charcuterie, but 4 for everything else.  The charcuterie is the best I've had anywhere. Duck proscuitto so fatty and moist, spicy thin sliced meats, delicious foie gras and terrine. Go just for the charcuterie. It is the best dish on their menu (based on the ones I've tried).   We also ordered the fried calves brains. The sauce was delicious but the meat itself just had a mushy texture that didn't appeal.  The sweetbread agnolloti was a better dish. Really, the charcuterie is king though. Don't ever go there without ordering it.  The main problem was the service. it started out ok, we ordered quickly and got our wine fast. The server was also very nice. It just took an unusually long time to get the charcuterie plate from when we ordered it. The table next to us, who ordered after us, got cooked dishes before our charcuterie came. Once we got that, the other dishes were timed right. Then, when we ordered dessert, the waitress went away for a while and came back to tell us it was a different dessert. We ordered that, but waited so long for it, we finally went and told the waitress to cancel it.  I will go back for more charcuterie, the bone marrow and the tongue sandwich (WHICH WAS HUGE!). Hopefully the service is better next time.  In a related note, the Black Hoof Cafe is supposedly opening today across the street!"}
{"text":"This is more a conversation piece than a place to eat.  All the food offered here is super rich and full of fat. Flavors are full and variable as well as not your everyday tastes. Only for once and a while, the meats offered at this restaurant is delicious and unique. Price reflects that.  Hipsters rejoice because here you can eat the taste of France and Montreal and yap yap yap about how amazing each mouthful of flavour is.  Come early. The place opens exactly at 6 and you need to get there early to get a seat. The place gets pretty packed even on a weekday."}
{"text":"come hungry and be open minded.  there is a lot of deliciousness going on here.  from the cocktails to the sweetbreads.  the space is small but operates smoothly.  bring cash or  Canadian debit.  can get cozy with the next table, so keep your large handbag at home lol"}
{"text":"Ok so I started going to the Hoof Cafe (which I love, it's a shame they converted its into a cocktail bar) for its amazing pulled pork eggs benny and tongue grilled cheese. Oh man, anyways.  Thought I'd try the Hoof since I loved the cafe so much. Came here on a Tuesday early evening, it wasn't busy, got seated on the nice patio at the back. Ordered a few things, the bone marrow, the pork belly and scallops, and foie torchon and the tongue on brioche.  First of all the food was delicious. The portions were extremely small for the price. The bone marrow was too buttery fatty and rich, it did taste good but got a little cloying. I prefer darker marrows with less fat. Also there wasn't any kind of jam or puree to eat it with, just crostini, basically nothing special. The Foie Torchon was delicious soft and buttery, but that coupled with the buttery marrow was way to much. Again it was served with nothing else, and they didn't even give enough crostini. About half of it sat on the plate while we waited for the others. The pork belly and scallops were really good, but a 19 dollar plate allowed me to have only one scallop and one pork belly -_-.... The tongue on brioche was the best and almost exactly the same as what I used to get at the Hoof Cafe. Thinly sliced cured meat, so good. We spread the rest of the foie on the brioche and it was to die for!  All in all, a good restaurant. The food is really quite good!   Would I return? Probably, just to have some interesting meats and the novelty factor. Way too many other places to go to though!  UPDATE--- I have gone and gotten the charcuterie and cheese board and was thoroughly satisfied. Meats were exotic and interesting and had tons of selection. Likewise for the cheese. I would go back just for this to be honest, loved it!  Also, after many years of eating at restaurants all over this city and the world, I would have to say the Hoof has remained consistently delicious and innovative and is worth the price!"}
{"text":"3.5/5  I do not know what happened to this place but my last two visit were full of disappointment. I visited this place long time ago and I instantly fall in love with this place.  I been raving about how great their charcuterie was and how creative their menu was to everyone.   I moved to uptown so couldn't get a chance to visit this place for a long time.  One day, me and my friends were craving charcuterie so I dragged them to come here and told them it was the best charcuterie experience I ever had in Toronto. Well when we received the board, I felt so bad. I was so excited to see heir usual fun and exotic meats that \"you can't normally get from anywhere in Toronto\" but all we got was lame \"you can get it from anywhere in Toronto\" kind of board. If their other dishes are as good as it used to be, well it would been okay but sadly it didn't happen. It was still a decent quality of food but what they are serving isn't as close as they used to be.   Well I thought maybe I went on a bad night so I went again two weeks later. Same thing happened.   Seriously what happened to you guys??    I know service isn't your thing so I can pass the \"I really don't want to be here and I'm too cool to serve you guys\" attitude from servers but one thing make up for all that was your food! Well you guys definitely went down the hill.   Thankfully their cocktails were still good so that saved my nights, but unfortunately I don't think I will make another an hour and half trip to this place anymore.   I guess I'll stick to dbar for the charcuterie until I find new charcuterie place in Toronto.. *sigh*"}
{"text":"Concluding our early depart from Bar Isabel, we noticed Black Hoof was right around the corner! hence it was necessary to start part DEUX of our foodie trip. First off, this place, like Bar Isabel, is easy to miss. However once you find it, its a beautiful, quaint, and small narrow foody joint.  The long bar counter, huge mirror, open concept kitchen, and dim lighting sets the mood for a good time whether on a romantic date, nocturnal bite, Black Hoof is a place to experience. Their extensive menu written on a chalkboard, as well extensive drink list is always welcomed.  Pork Carnita tacos! 5/5 yummers!!!! pulled/braised pork topped off with their sauce, and crunchy pork skin is the bomb!!!!! Im not a big taco fan but this was pork to my heart....sorry close to my heart! texture, flavor, and perfect balance on all scale definitely a must if you come here."}
{"text":"My sweet lady and I were excited to try this local restaurant for quite some time, upon the recommendation of one of my best buds (and fellow yelper), Steve L., as the Black Hoof has long been his favourite dining spot in Toronto.  First and foremost, you should be a pretty adventurous eater to fully enjoy this experience; though, anyone would enjoy the pork tacos.   But for the bold, you can try unique and unusual delicacies like bone marrow, tongue and horse.  The food was all served like art on a plate and was worth photographing... and eating of course.  The atmosphere was typical of the bustling toronto hip spot; service was also great.  I would return even for the delicious bourbon cocktails."}
{"text":"Came here for a pre-emptive Valentine's day dinner the Friday before. This was actually our second visit; I had remembered how good the foie + dessert tasted the first time and wanted seconds. This time was much better than the first  Food: Charcuterie + Bread & Butter (+6$), Albacore Tuna Crudo, Horse Tartare, Sweetbread sausages, Cow Heart and Potatoes, Carrot Cake and Foie  Cocktails - Tea & Sympathy - Garrido Sour  Review: We figured the Charcuterie dish would be good at an establishment specializing in meat and we were not wrong. The only problem was that we had to order bread and butter to go along with it because it did not come with the dish!  The Albacore Tuna Crudo reminded us of a Peruvian dish we had tried. The fish was lightly seared and garnished with raw onion slices, nuts, and sprouts. We did not like the Peruvian dish but this one made the necessary changes that made it very tasty.    The Horse Tartare was definitely the highlight of our meal. I had tried something similar in Japan and remember it being the best thing ever so I was hoping for a good reproduction of that dish here and was not disappointed.   Because it was Valentine's day (for us), we felt the need to order the Cow heart and potatoes. Think medium rare steak without any fat. Very savoury and not bad at all.   Carrot Cake and Foie: foie gras and dessert is definitely an unusual combination and while this dish was very tasty, it was unfortunately not as well-done as the previous time with blueberry pancakes. The carrot cake, carrot and ginger sorbet, and foie gras were individually very good on their own but did not mesh well together on the plate.   The cocktails were amazing. As an amateur \"mixologist\", I can appreciate the creativity needed to make these drinks. Both cocktails were completely different and an order of magnitude better than what I had tried at other restaurants and bars. The Garrido sour somehow tasted like a fruit smoothie with all my favourite fruits and the Tea and Sympathy was light and refreshing.   My advice: don't be afraid to spend a bit more money here to get the full experience.  That's what we did the second time around and it resulted in a much better meal. Our bill came out to just over $180 for two people. Oh, and if you aren't an equestrian, try the horse tartare, it's life changing."}
{"text":"The hoof is easily the most innovative cooking to come to Toronto this year.   Incredible charcuterie, delicious libations, and a convivial atmosphere.   A few words of caution... 1. if you follow any dietary rules, throw them out the window.  2. you might have to wait for a table, it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Food - 4 Atmosphere - 5 Price - 5 Service - 4  Sara our hostess was awesome. The food was great. They don't take reservations so expect a little wait. Just go next door to Rhum Corner or across the street for wine at Archive.   Bone Marrow was good. Carnita Tacos were great and the Beef Heart was very good. The only reason for the 4 stars was the mustard on the Tongue Brioche was just to dang strong. The mustard flavor overpowered the actual essence of the dish.  I also wish that my beef heart was more prominent and not lost in a sea of french fries. It almost felt like I was eating a poor imitation of poutine. I also had to get up and walk to a 7 eleven for cash after my meal because my Visa debit/credit card wasn't accepted because I am from the States. A highly rated restaurant should be better prepared to accommodate its patrons.   The drinks here are phenomenal. I had different kinds and I suggest that you do the same. All and all though it was a great experience and we do plan to return."}
{"text":"So you're looking for horse meat in the City of Toronto. Here's one!  I come to this popular place to get two birds stoned at once--that is, to try for the first time horse meat and foie gras. Sad life, much?  Located in the burgeoning north end of the trendy Trinity-Bellwoods neighbourhood, The Black Hoof has all the markings of an aesthetically hipster joint: - Homey rustic and vintage decor: check! - Menu written on overhead chalkboards: check! - Borderline too loud audio system ghetto-blasting 90s hip-hop: check! - Dim lighting/dark ambiance: check!, unless you are seated at the front when there's still daylight. Then you get the benefit of watching streetcars run by and staff making supply trips to and from the Hoof's cocktail bar across the street. That, or find yourself in their rear patio.  Going in early in an evening, there was no lineup, and we were immediately seated at the front. The first thing I saw upon entering was a girl at the bar, uninhibitedly taking photos of EVERYTHING: her food, the array of jars and bottles behind the bar, some little corner somewhere. It was a jarring rude sight to be greeted with. If I had brought my own SLR with me, I'd channel my inner Clint Eastwood and challenge her to a duel.  Upon delivering your meal to your table, your young pleasant server will explain what went in your dish. If I remember correctly, the horse tartare ($17) was garnished with the likes of soy mayo and shimeji mushrooms. For a moment, I thought about pulling a Mr. Bean skit here (look up \"Mr. Bean steak tartare\"). Instead, I let my mouth rummage through the juicy, tender, light taste of raw horse meat. It is quite, as a previous reviewer states, like eating sashimi. Meanwhile, Foie with waffles ($25), finished with butternut squash, mustard and maple syrup,,, quite indescribably something in itself.  Crazy stuff. It is quite a fun light and relaxing experience, where they clearly put much attention in showcasing the meat dishes and offals they prepare. However, the meals are on the small side, and it can be pricey. If I come back, I will be sure to try the charcuterie board and the bone marrow.  {TTC: 505 streetcar to Grace St.}"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto so far.  I love everything about this place, from the ambiance, to the food, to the service.  As has been mentioned before, remember to bring cash since they do not accept any other form of payment.  I came here with an old friend of mine and his wife, who were in town for the weekend.  They live in New York and are used to eating at some of the finest places.  Suffice it to say that they were suitably impressed as well.  The charcuterie platter was the best I've had, and the bone marrow simply delicious.  Unfortunately, my friends were not up to trying the raw horse meat, so that will have to wait for another time.  The service was outstanding.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable, recommended an excellent wine, and was attentive to all our needs.  The meal was utterly delicious and totally reasonable in terms of price.  I can't wait to go back, but this is the kind of place that is so special that I don't want to \"kill\" it and will wait until I have other friends from out of town."}
{"text":"It was a New York state of mind last night for the girls who love to eat the meat.  Deanna's official last night in the land of maple leaf before jetting off to NYC was spent in part on Dundas Street where we managed to snag up the last available table at the Hoof.  Joining us was our favorite sharp dressed man, Dale \"don't you love my frittatas\" M.  It was his maiden voyage at the Hoof so we were pleased that the girls who loved to eat the meat could be a part of this special moment.  :)    As usual the cocktails rocked.  Rosy Cheeks all the way for this girl!  Tis cool that they actually garnish this drink with a fresh rose petal.  Drinks aside, the Black Hoof had its carnivore A game in full working gear.  We shared, noshed, gabbed, laughed, cajoled and bonded as foodies over the charcuterie board.   Of course everyone at the table knew what we came for....giddeup!  That's right, it was all about the raw horse meat sammy.  If you ain't into the tartar then ain't gonna be your thing.  Seasoned raw horse meat piled high with an egg yolk on the top, garnished with onions and some lip tingling mustard made for a major mmmmmm moment. It's pretty cool that they spell the word horse on a slice of bread with the mustard.    It was a great way to spend Deanna's last evening in the city knowing it was one of her most favorite spots.  Now I'm waiting patiently for the Baby Hoof to open up across the street.  Can't wait to see what they've got in store for us there."}
{"text":"My girlfriend asked me if i had been to this place called black hoof before....i replied no and that was the end of that. We planned a girls night out and black hoof was the main event. She treated me (such a good friend) as this was going to be food i have never had before and she wanted to share it with me. HOLY CRAP i ate some s*** i would never have thought my tongue would touch. But a couple glasses of wine later and there i was. The most memorable item i had was the tongue on brioche! Ok so waaay back in the day there was a show on tv that use to review movies and in during commercial breaks would make weird recipes and one night one of them was cow tongue.  I was utttterly (no pun) disgusted. My girlfriend told me that I had to have it cause it was so good. Now in allll honestly it was AMAZING. I would have it again, and again, and again. It was juicy and succulent. The bread was perfect and it was so nicely seasoned. It was not at all what I thought tongue would taste like. It was much better lol. We also have a chicuterie board with different meats on it and one of them was pig heart. You could even see where the arteries were! But none the less also amazing! Now I know this one sounds gross BUT we had deep fried pig entestines (I think they were enestines lol could have been some other part of the pig) but they were delish! The dipping sauce also and obviously complimented them so well and made the experiemetal eating all worth the while. Our server was fantastic and the wine was great. I have been meaning to go back and hope in the near future will check it out again. The menu is seasonally changing I believe with some fo the same items on it but this will be the one spot that I wont be eating the regular stuff lol"}
{"text":"I was super excited to come here based on all the reviews but did not think to check the menu beforehand.  Boy, were my friends and I surprised when we saw the unique and exotic tapas listed on their chalkboard menu.  We were a bit hesitant on devouring such meat so we only tried a few.  I wish we tried a wider variety.   Pistachio Hummus & Chicken Livers [$8] - loved this one, very creamy and rich Spicy Scallops Crudo [$16] - flavors complemented raw scallops extremely well Pickle[d Vegetables] [$4] - yum, must get if you like pickles! Bread [$3] - soft and moist, went incredibly well with our pistachio hummus tapa  Special Note:  no reservations accepted, cash and canadian debit cards only, closed Tuesdays & Wednesdays.  For a tourist, this was a little inconvenient so I'm deducting one star but food-wise = 5 stars!"}
{"text":"HORSE TARTARE. I ate here two and a half weeks ago and I'm still dreaming of it at night. Everything we got here was excellent.   For two people we ordered: Horse Tartare, Fois Torchon, Bone Marrow, Snail and Mushroom Tagliatelle, and two beers.  Seriously just thinking about the tartare is making my mouth water. The meat was lean, but really rich and creamy with the egg yolk, then you had the super thin veggie chips, raw shallots/onions and other earth sprouts that gave it such a nice balance of flavours and textures. That entire dish was just excellently executed. Yes it's raw horse meat, yes you should try it. PERFECTION. Seriously. I would've licked the plate, but I didn't want to embarrass my date even more. ($17)  The Fois Torchon was pretty good, creamy, salty, yummy. But I expected more. I think this was the only dish I was partially disappointed in... But the jam on the side really complemented the super saltiness of the fois.  The bone marrow was yummy, obviously. Creamy, fatty, oily, salty... what more could you ask for? It also came with grapefruit horseradish. Super interesting. Another MUST order. Yumm... (Market Price: $9)  Snail and Mushroom Tagliatelle is surprisingly filling. It was a good ending dish for us. It was pretty heavy after all the pure fat we ate--- the pasta noodles were really big and thick I don't remember a lot about the flavours of this dish because it was super yummy and had great texture, and I was just stuffing my face with everything.   The waiters were really nice, they brought everything out at a really good rate for us. They paid attention to when we were about to finish a plate and started to bring out the next one. They were helpful when we asked about the menu items and our water/beer cups were never empty.   Our total came up to around $100 with tax for two people, tip not included.  I wanted the Fois on French Toast but they didn't have it on the menu that night. Can't wait to come back and try their other dishes/ cocktails!"}
{"text":"Black Hoof is a decent place to get unique items. The restaurant is in an area that is fairly quiet. It is small and cozy.  Service: service was extremely slow. It was worse when they forgot one item that my group ordered. We ended up staying at the restaurant for a long time since they forgot an item. Moreover, servers paid little attention to my table and didn't replenish water unless they were asked to. I think they should be much more attentive.   Food: some items were good but others were just average. Nothing really stood out. I was excited to get the bone marrow but it wasn't outstanding.   I wouldn't mind visiting again to get different items. But nothing stood out to me to give me an incentive to venture out to this area to eat here"}
{"text":"go here with friends so that you can try as much as possible! I went here with a couple of friends on a sunday night (good choice - no lineup) and ordered the following:  house cured meats - 10/10, i love charcuterie (and the lardo mousse was 11/10) roasted bone marrow - 9/10... fantastically rich but too little bone marrow compared to bone pork carnitas tacos - 9.5/10 - i thought that this was going to be boring compared to the other things that we ordered, but it was great - the pork was awesomely juicy and rich, and the toppings complemented it perfectly tongue on brioche - 8.5/10 - compared to the other dishes, this one was a bit of a letdown to me - still great, but lacking the intense richness of the other dishes. however, the portion size was good, and my friend kept on exclaiming \"THIS IS BETTER THAN SCHWARTZ'S!\" so it clearly had an impact on him smoked sweetbreads, fiddlheads and ramps - 6.5/10 - too much breading on the sweetbreads, couldn't really taste any flavour other than smokiness and KFC spice foie gras with morels - 10/10 - foie gras is just insanely good.  dessert, some sort of brioche doughnut on pineapple with creme fraiche? - 8.5/10 - very tasty and not too sweet (much appreciated after such a rich meal), but very small portion  the food was a 4.5/5 in total, and i would love to go back with more people next time and try more dishes (i love how the menu is constantly rotating!). our service was above average, very attentive and helpful with the menu. the ambiance on the back patio is amazing, perfect for a warm late spring evening. all in all it was a fantastic experience that i'll definitely be back for one day."}
{"text":"I was extremely pleasantly surprised by Black Hoof.  I was expecting a good meal--I didn't expect great.  We had a cheese platter, pickles, bread, asparagus and morels and pork carnitas tacos.   Everything was great--the cheese platter in particular came with an awesome set of sides.  I always expect to be disappointed by cheese platters as they're invariably price for small portions of cheese.  Not so here.  Their pickles are delicious and varied.  The tacos, though, made me wish I could eat about seven.  Juicy, crispy pork bits will live in my dreams.  The veggies were well done as well though I wasn't an enormous fan of the gribiche sauce.  It wasn't bad, just not to my taste.  Take a look at the menu before you go--the very unusual cuts that permeate the menu make it a no-no for boring eaters and vegetarians.  Though the house-made bread kept my veg sister happy!"}
{"text":"So. Your in Toronto and you want to go for an adventure.   Culinary delights are your thing and then boom you pull up yelp and look at some places.      Hmmm the walk to Black Hoof isn't too bad.  Boom.  You have just entered a culinary masterpiece.   We had the charcuterie.  It was amazing.    Followed that with the bone marrow.   My dog is currently at this second still chewing on the bone.   If it wasn't considered indecent I would probably be down on the floor with her.   For the rest we went with pork carnitas (safest choice on the menu) as my love not as adventurous as I.  They we're the best resto tacos I have had.    Final course.    Foie gras waffles.     Enough said.   This was an amazing meal and we can't wait to get back and try more.  Also.   Drinks are amazing and plenty boozy as you can tell by my typing.  :)"}
{"text":"ah black hoofs . *happy sigh*  long story short, they never ever ever leave me disappointed . every single items on their menu is out of this world . so delicious, so very unique . you can tell a lot of TLC went into its food & menu . the menu changes all the time, leaving me wanting to come  here ALL the frigin time . the chefs, cooks, bartenders, actually no, ALL their staffs deserve some serious props . best people ever ! food here is worth every single precious penny of my poor student budget . whenever a special occassion comes up so i can justify spending lotsa moola on a meal, i suggest black hoofs . they make me ecstatically happy that im not a vegetarian . im not even going to review everything i ate here cuz no matter what you order, it'll be amazing, guaranteed . the only thing left for them to do to make it better is getting a nap room for the food coma you'll be getting from all this meat . ha :)  i love you black hoofs & i miss your hoof cafe dearly . - they should seriously consider serving brunch here, no ?!"}
{"text":"Arg, I feel terrible giving this place 3 stars, but has to be done...  Friend recommended this place and when I saw the review on Yelp I was STOKED. When we arrived I was shocked to see how tiny this place was. Strike 1.  Strike 2 was the menu. It was on the wall and was honestly too hard to read. It didn't help the lights were so dim. Felt weird squinting through several other tables to read the menu.  Portions are extremely small for the price you pay. I get it, kinda tapas style, but this was more like tapas for babies... strike 3.  Nothing memorable. Honestly can't even remember what we ate there (this is rare). Service, however, was great.  I wouldn't recommend this place for groups of 4 or more."}
{"text":"Trendy intimate restaurant that really lives up to the hype. Fairly small and candlelit. The restaurant is pretty pricey, recommended that you order 4-6 dishes between two people (each dish costing $13-24 depending on what you order).  Nice selection of small dishes, ended up ordering the horse tartare, smoked mackerel, charcuterie and the snail & mushroom tagliatelle. All of these dishes were really excellent - horse tartare had really interesting flavor and was very enjoyable with the sauce, must order. Mackerel had an amazing pure flavor paired with a nice broth, small noodles and onion. Charcuterie has 4 different types of meat with a side of mustard and Korean spice paste - really good, nice tasting multiple types of cured meat. The pasta was also delicious - more great flavor.   Incredible restaurant, one of the best I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came to this place a couple weeks ago with my girlfriend. Been wanting to try it, and finally I have!  We got the cheese platter, bone marrow, olives, and foie gras.  The restaurant is quite nice and comfy. Has a great open kitchen, and the staff are great.  The food was great. Loved the cheese platter and the pairings of jams/chutneys that went with it (I forgot the name of the smoked cheese. So good!). The olives were excellent as well. I played it kinda safe, and got two things that I ate when I was younger. The foie gras and bone marrow.  The bone marrow was allot fattier than I remember. But with a sprinkle of salt and some bread. It was to die for. The foie gras was very good as well, served on a piece of toast with a syrup. I wish they served it on something else though. The toast just seemed too light and plain for something such as foie gras.  Service was excellent. CONSTANTLY filling up our water which is a huge plus to me. And everyone in the restaurant was really talkative and excited about the food which was something that ive never experienced before. pretty cool   Would like to come back here, and try something more 'exotic' like the pig head tacos. It's a great place for drinks, snacks and exploring your adventurous side. great place for a first date!"}
{"text":"When anyone asks me what my favorite restaurant is in Toronto, the Black Hoof always makes the list.  It's probably one of the secret gems of Toronto that has stood the test of time and always a treat to go to.  This place is on Dundas street in between Little Italy and Little Portugal.  The challenge is that unless you have been there before, it's not the easiest thing to find; It's not like they have a giant neon sign hanging outside.  So I learned this the hard way, but vegetarians beware.  I had a birthday here once where one of my friends was a vegetarian.  The only thing usually on the menu that is vegetarian is the bread and the cheese.  Fortunately the staff here is really accommodating and made a \"off the menu\" pasta dish for him.   As for the rest of the carnivores/omnivores, this place is heaven.  At first you'll notice that they don't really have very much space or tables.  You'll even find it funny how they use a standard coiled home oven range to do most of their cooking.  What you will notice though is a deli slicer, a cozy atmosphere and a pretty nice bar.  Another note about this place... No reservations.  This place usually get's pretty busy by 6:40ish so try and get there before.  The magic number for this place is 2, so if you have any more people than that, make sure you're getting there early.  We waited for 1.5 hours one time (but it was worth every minute).    Now onto the food.  One thing I really appreciate about this place is their ever changing menu.  While there's always a new flavour on the charcuterie platter, some new cheeses or some new dish or appetizer, they do seem to keep the favorites on the menu.  Take for example the raw horse sammy.  Again, it's hard to tell you what is good here cause the stuff changes so much.  I remember having pate laced with vanilla, foie gras moose, all kids of cured meats from pig, bison, duck you name it.  Seriously, if you go in here, CHARCUTERIE PLATTER.  It is probably one of the best experiences you'll ever have in life... but in your mouth.  I've had the procuitto there too and it's also amazing.  Describing the raw horse sammy to people is always a coin flip.  I mean, you're eating horse... raw.  As weird as it sounds, it's actually amazing.  The sandwich comprises of raw horse, topped with shallots and an egg to bind everything together in between two pieces of rye bread.  Top that with some \"hot sauce\" and you've got yourself an amazing sandwich.  Personally I get it every time; that's how good it is.  As for the non meat option, the cheese platter is actually also amazing.  The thing they do really well here is pair their cheeses with jams and sauces that complement them really really well.  This is again one of the things I order every time.  Even though the magic number of this place is 2; I always tell people that ask me the best number to go here with is 4.  Why you may ask?  It's cause you'll get to try more of the dishes, and since the dishes are all sharable dishes, it just promotes that intimate group setting and the overall experience of the place.  Long story short, I can't wait to go back to the Black Hoof.  Combine superior food, a great atmosphere and staff that's always willing to tell you what's going on and you've got yourself one of the best restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"I found the menu very pricy for the portion. Portions are small, even for tapas size. You get half a bone marrow, not even the whole.  Taste wise, the crudo was tasty.  The tongue was good but not recognizable as tongue (nothing bad). The sweetbreads though was heavily covered with batter and could hardly taste the inside.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Service was quick and efficient. I just found the price and portions not to my liking."}
{"text":"Among the most complex and delicious food I've had in Toronto. The horse tartare is exquisite, and so is the variety of charcuterie on offer. Great unique drink options too."}
{"text":"Our second time dining in this meat eater's paradise. This is a fun place to go to with a group. Just make sure your group is somewhat adventurous with their culinary tastes. And absolutely no vegetarians allowed!! They even garnish with meat here. The chefs in this place rock. I love watching them create in the small open kitchen next to the bar.   So here's what we had: The first dish was hog jowls and grits, by far my favourite. Sinfully, amazingly rich.  Next we had the smoked whitefish. Maybe it was a little too subtle to follow such a powerful dish but I found it underwhelming in flavour. The fish was meant to be spread on crackers and topped with sour cream and hot sauce from squeeze bottles. The fish mixture was too dry and chunky and the crackers were too thin and crispy so it wasn't working out very well for me. Most of mine ended up on the table.  On to the next dish, beef heart & XO. The heart was a bit chewy as heart is sometimes. The thing I liked most about this one was the crispy dried brussels sprouts chips scattered over the slices of heart.  Finally we had what seemed to be the most popular dish last time we went- the tongue on brioche. It's popular for a reason. Generous portion and oh so tender. It reminded me of pastrami. Not at all what I was expecting. In a good way. It has a fun presentation with a big skewer through it and topped with a squiggly dollop of mayo. Delish.  I wanted to have the foie and pancake but there was no room left. Ah well we'll just have to go back."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is overrated. The space is small and cramped so you everyone can hear your conversation, and the food is nothing special. It may or may not be a fluke, but the service we got was pretty bad. We got the waitress' attention but before we could ask what we were going to, she interrupted us and told us she'd be right with us. No problem, we figure she was just going to deal with one other table who was waiting or something. Nope, we watched her go to every single table and then hang out by the bar clearly having forgotten us. Would not return."}
{"text":"A short cab ride from the main convention centre drag where I was holed up for most of the week - about 10 minute ride.  It was admittedly a challenge to get some colleagues to head over to Black Hoof. But I think that turned out for the better since it is a smaller place and our wait was tolerable (35 mins for 2 people across the street at the bar!).  I was a bit overwhelmed by all of the mesmerizing and delectable options, so buddy and I tried to sample as many different dishes as possible.  We worked on olives & bread and the small charcuterie plate. The meats were very delicious and a bit adventurous - blueberries in salami? sweeeet.  Main courses include the veggie gnocchi (just OK for me), the rabbit and pea pasta (savory meat, fresh pasta, good!) and the tongue on brioche (WHOA EXCELLENT!). The tongue sandwich was recommended by not only the waitress (her favorite on the menu), but also the ladies sitting next to us who said it was stupendous. And it was.  For any Americans, they graciously accept CAD and USD!   Fun, unpretentious contemporary vibe."}
{"text":"It's morel season!!!! They had foie Gras with morels and it was the tastiest thing in the world.  Also had bone marrow, 5cheese platter, charcuterie and smoked beef tartar. All were amazing. The only things better than our food was our server who answered every single foodie question we threw at him. Bravo"}
{"text":"The Black Hoof is Charcuterie at it's best, but it's so much more than that. It's got  inventive uses of offal, a modern beer and wine list, and arrogant servers to boot. The arrogant, downright surly servers are part of the experience you could say, but if I wanted the attitude to match the avante-garde menu, I'd be in Brooklyn, not Toronto. It all adds up to a story, and fortunately for The Black Hoof, that story is passion, dedication and delicious food. The menu is not for the faint of heart, I wouldn't exactly call calf's brain, sweetbreads, and horse universally appealing. Yes, there was horse, both on the outstanding Charcuterie plate in a cured form, and raw in the horse \"sammy\" with a house-made hot sauce. The raw horse was rather mild, cut from the tenderloin, it's a glorified play on traditional beef tartare, rounded out with a fresh egg yolk, the addition of a little salt could have carried the dish to another level.  Plates are intended to share, much like tapas, the bill could get away from you pretty quickly if you go in starving. But everything is worth a try, the passion is literally on the plate. Three guys man the tiny kitchen, all in the open, and just about everything is made in-house. Sweetbreads are light and crispy, kind of a grown-up chicken nugget, and I mean that in the best way possible. Accompanied with mushrooms, pea and pea tendrils, they are glazed delicately with a palate satisfying horseradish butter. Bone marrow comes piping hot, served classically with parsley salad and toasted bread, it's the most in-your-face offering on the menu, nothing is disguised, either you like it or you don't. Pork belly, squid and watermelon is pleasing to the eye, and the pork is divine, crispy on the outside and soft and delicate on the inside. The squid is a miss, however, tough and fishy, it fails to deliver. The seared watermelon and watermelon syrup round out the plate, but don't necessarily make the dish noteworthy. Calf's brain ravioli is solid, slightly gamey, the tang of Parmesan makes it one of the most accessible dishes on the menu.  The key with offal is that although it may not appealing to everyone on the surface, in most cases, the flavors and textures are familiar, and frying or stuffing it in a ravioli truly makes it accessible to all. The Black Hoof is good at what it's best at, which is meat and lots of it. While vegetables do make an appearance on some plates, they aren't the star, but of course, they don't have to be. The Charcuterie, offal, and dedicated chefs make this a trendy place to dine in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"After a extremely long travel delay and getting into Toronto much later than expected, my gf and I were still eager to get to Black Hoof for a late dinner. Of course, being featured on one of Bourdain's shows, we already knew it was going to be good. But not THIS good.  After studying their menu written on their walls and admiring that they were putting out dish after dish from a tiny little kitchen. Literally the size of my fairly small kitchen at home, these guys were throwing out 5-star restaurant quality food...something I know aspire to. So here is what we got:  Tongue on brioche - for those who are scared of tongue, one taste of this dish and you will be a true convert. All you have to do is get over the mental barrier that this is tongue (not a problem for me since I'm Asian and have been eating these things forever). In fact, after one bite, you won't even know it's tongue since the Black Hoof guys have transformed its taste to match the best deli pastrami. Loved it...one of my favorite dishes ever.  Liver and onions - classed up, this traditional dish is served liver pâté and pan fried pearl onions. I have an almost irrational love for good pâté, so this dish as right up my alley. If there is a knock on this dish, it is that it is extremely rich.  Scallop crudo - in a menu highlighted with turf as opposed to surf, the scallop crudo was a nice break. The flavors were great, the scallop was fresh, and the presentation was beautiful. But at the end of the day, this is a hard dish to mess up and I was not surprised that Black Hoof made a great version.  Bone marrow - of all the dishes we took on, this may have been the only one its served up in all its natural glory. There simply isn't anything you need to do to bone marrow to make it good and I'm glad Black Hoof simply served it up roasted, salted and with toast.  This is the restaurant that I would love to see in DC. Great...Amazing...food at a very reasonable price. For a one hour flight, I would happy make the trip up to our neighbors in the north for another meal at Black Hoof."}
{"text":"This place is really hard to find at night, we missed the sign so many times..  The food potion is super small but they aren't cheap, none of the food we ordered tasted good.   People hyped up about the bone marrow which I ordered, tasteless, pure fat and oil.. we asked few pieces extra bread to go with the marrow since we have few people at the table and it ran out quickly, the waitress brings over another 3 pieces and charged addition 3 dollars..  There's no proper menu provided, but they did write them on the wall tho, you have to walk all the way back to see them. And the place was really dark so we can barely see anything on the wall.   1/5 disappointed as this place is very pretentious. Came here because of yelp review and I felt stupid dragged my friends into this. We left there with $60+ bill and felt still hungry."}
{"text":"I get the whole appeal of Black Hoof.. I do....adventurous meat dishes. Unfortunately for me adventurous did not equal a satisfying experience. The night started off very well with the duck wings, which although was served as an app, could very well be a full meal given the portion size. I ordered the oxtail and scallops because the combination was too good to resist but was left largely unsatisfied. The scallops were ordinary while the oxtail to me seemed like a subpar breaded cutlet. I also tried the marrow and once again, was left largely unsatisfied. I also tried the beef tongue on brioche and let's just say I've had better.... For me the flavor was lacking in the dishes and it was a tad bit overpriced .  Yes it may warrant a second visit and maybe it was overhyped to me and yes I should have ordered the Charcuterie plate but I doubt my opinion will change.  It's decent ...but nothing special."}
{"text":"My trio ordered the tongue on brioche, charcuterie, bone marrow, horse tartar, bison heart terrine, and finished with the foie and pancakes.   My favorite, up until the foie conclusion of our meal, was the tongue on brioche. It was flavorful, melt in your mouth consistency of meat, and brioche perfectly crispy. The horse tartar was tasty, but to be honest, I think I preferred beef tartars I've had in the past. The charcuterie was delicious, but the stand-out for me was the schmaltz (whipped chicken fat) and the - I think- beef liver pate? This was my first taste of bone marrow, and I enjoyed it- but the salt and chimichurri along with it really made it amazing.  But. Then. I tried the foie gras and buttermilk pancakes with blueberry compote and captain crunch crumble. Holy cow. I don't remember the last time I ate something so good that it took my breath away and made me close my eyes and smile. It was amazing. The meltiest in your mouth it could be, so rich and decadent, and I don't know what to say. Just get it. Seriously. I was hesitant, and it was the best thing we ever did. ORDER IT. Stop thinking about it, just do it. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Holly heavy meal ever! I had the nutella foie gras, liver and onions, blood sausage, beef tongue, bone marrow, beef heart tartare. So full, so fatty, so good."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner with friends and it was definitely one of the best meals I've had in a while.    There were five of us so we could order a good variety of food, including the charcuterie and cheese plates, and everything we ordered was quite tasty.  That being said, these two were the highlights for me: the pork carnitas, which were out of control delicious and the bone marrow, which was definitely a surprise as I've had marrow before and found it to be only okay at best.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you are pretty much guaranteed to wait at least an hour and they don't take reservations (at least on a Friday night).  But as long as you know that will happen, you can just enjoy a drink at the cocktail bar across the street while you wait for their call.    Overall, amazing food and fantastic service - highly recommended if you love meat and if you like to be a little adventurous!"}
{"text":"Black Hoof just keeps getting better over the years since they've opened.  When I started coming here I was immediately impressed with their beautiful house made Charcuterie, and really off-the-wall menu items, things you just won't see anywhere else.  That hasn't changed, but their creativity has grown and gone to the next level, with really unique pairings that work beautifully, that I've never seen anywhere else before.   Very rarely can a restaurant excite me with their creativity quite like Black Hoof does.  I can't even describe to you my last meal there, for fear of revealing my true gluttony... All I have to say is, you just need to go.  Open late. Good thing too, since it seems the only time I've been able to get a table is after 10 or 11."}
{"text":"I love the intense, disciplined focus on one type of food that it's possible to do really well year 'round with local ingredients.  The pâté and meats were everything I'd hoped they would be, but the highlight was without a doubt the cod cheeks in a light vinegar-based sauce with a few slices of Thai chili.  I can see the no-reso policy being bothersome on busy nights, but in our case we just left a phone number and walked a few blocks to kick it at the Press Club.  We had exactly enough time for one drink before our table was up.  A tip of the hat to our knowledgeable-but-not-snotty server and his handling of my obtuse question, \"Are there *any* carbs on the menu?!?\""}
{"text":"After hearing about The Black Hoof from a friend and lots of hype and five star yelp reviews, I decided to check it out. I have been on a quest to find a great Toronto restaurant that can be my local favorite. I had high hopes that the Hoof could deliver.   Here are my conclusions for those who may want a slightly different take.....  The place merits five stars on a few points.   1. It has a great charcuterie plate  2. It also has highly creative dishes. I mean, how many times have you had horse, beef hearts, or bone marrow at more respectable places in Toronto?   3. The Black Hoof also has a cool, trendy vibe for those who need that.  4. All the food is prepared in a kitchen where four people are cooking and cleaning in a space about half the size of an average condo kitchen. This is most impressive.  Beyond this, there are negatives....  1. The food is good, but not great overall. The Black Hoof offers pork tacos and tuna crudo for those who had beef hearts for lunch. These taste the same as they do anywhere else with a touch of added flair and expense.  2. The portion sizes are small, like tapas or appetizers, but approaching full entree price at similarly styled places. If you are hungry, you will need to spend high end money to fill up here.  3. The cocktails are expensive. They range from $11 for an undersized margarita, to $17. A half-liter of sangria is $23. This would be understandable at a nicer cocktail lounge that makes everything from scratch on the spot, but this is not that. Here you are a maximum of 15 feet from the hot stove when the beef livers are sizzling. My two drinks were good, but nothing special.  4. The service is not very good, though in fairness, everyone seems to be scrambling to navigate the tight quarters and avoid any back up in the tiny kitchen.  In the end, go to say you've been, and maybe go back to impress your friends with your refined taste in bone marrow. That should just about do it."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and I'll just comment on the dishes I had.  I was pretty blown away on my first visit.  I enjoyed my second visit, but was honestly a bit bored.  I had the horse tartare and bone marrow both times (so maybe I'm partially to blame) as I was coming with other '1st timers' on both visits.  Bone marrow is always glorious, so there's not too much to say about that.  As for the horse tartare, the first time it was seasoned similar to steak tartare (with vinaigrette and an egg).  So, it's really not too different from regular tartare.  I thought it was probably a bit overseasoned, so maybe it drowned out the horsey goodness?  The second time, the horse tartare was straight up and was garnished with BLACK SESAME PASTE and clams.  The clams were just lost in this - but the nuttiness of the black sesame actually worked with raw meat for me.  Odd, eh?  I much preferred the 2nd attempt - still hard to distinguish from regular steak tartare, but it was indeed original.  The carnitas tacos are good, but really don't standout that much versus other tasty tacos joints like Grand Electric.  The fried chicken and jellyfish salad was interesting and would have probably worked, but the chicken was overbattered and tasted burnt.  I really really liked two dishes: fried sweetbreads and the scallops over oxtail.  The fried sweetbreads came with a mustard, so it actually reminded me of eating a really good Chicken McNugget.  Okay, I know this is a putdown for most people, but I love McNuggets (you may unfollow me now).  Well... it's like if a McNugget finished silky and creamy.  But that mustard really put me in that mindset.  My favourite dish was from my first visit - probably the best surf and turf I've ever had: scallops over oxtail.  I thought about that dish a good week and it made me drool everytime.  I would have ordered it again on my 2nd visit if it was on the menu.  I don't expect everything to be a hit - especially with a rotating menu and a creative drive at work.  Black Hoof is a bit spendy, but I think the prices are pretty reasonable considering the quality.  Overall, probably one of my favourite restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"i came here after watching bourdain eat here on his short layover show in toronto. i tried the bread, cheese, salmon, sweetbread and horse tar tar.   horse tar tar - really good! tastes like beef tar tar tho, so if youre expecting any crazy new flavor u may be dissapointed.   sweetbread - tasted like fried stuff. didnt really feel like it was that great.   overall very cool environment and a good experience!"}
{"text":"Black hoof is one of those places you gotta try once (or twice). The hype of serving recession meat is enough to pique my interest.  We arrived at 5:30 and there was a short lineup by the door, which can be an indication of really good food, or just plain hype.  I have to know which one.  We ordered the horse tartare,  which for me,  was the highlight of the meal. Good presentation, it had a raw egg on top, which held all the robust flavours together.  The idea of eating raw horsemeat was exciting,  and I was pleasantly surprised.  I could have finished this dish by myself.  We also ordered the bone marrow,  which was exactly what it was.  It was bland for my taste,  but the chimichurri added a bit of life to the otherwise plain taste. Next was the pork jowl,  crispy fried on the outside,  but juicy and flavour on the inside. Decent beer selections,  I wouldn't mind coming for seconds to try other items on the menu if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of the biggest disappointments in the city. Other expensive places are actually nice inside, have good service, and have great food. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for the Black Hoof. Honestly, the food actually did taste OK. But just O-K. Too bad it was one of the worst portions I've ever seen. It gets better... they charge extra for bread, olives, and even PICKLES. Yes, believe it. Who ever is running this place is ridiculously stingy. Oh wait it gets even better. They don't take credit card. Why? Because the owner doesn't want to pay the merchant fee for credit card transactions. Enjoy a serving of olives, $4 for 6 small pieces. Serving of pickles, $2 for 4 mini pickles. Well done hoof!"}
{"text":"This review is overdue. I might as well get the bad stuff out of the way: the dishes are not cheap. But that's really the only negative, because the food itself is superb. Inventive, clever twists on some culinary staples that really opens the taster's eyes to the many ways that meat can be prepared and served. The liver and onions dish continues to haunt my dreams--in a good way!"}
{"text":"Black Hoof was the best restaurant that I went to during my Toronto visit. It's featured on Anthony Bourdain show, so of course we had to try it!   Pork Carnitas Taco ($11) - Served with Pork Rinds, Avocados & Soft Tortilla (3 per serving). This was pretty good; There're a lot of flavor within the tacos & the carnitas was nicely made.  House Cured Meat ($19) - All the curing/aging were done on site so this is a good opportunity to try most of them! The entree basically comes with a board & filled with a lot of different meat, cuts & flavors (garlic, pepper, etc). It ranges from Capicola, Mortadella, Pepperoni, Pancetta, Chorizo, Salami, Prusciutoo, etc (served with dijon mustard). You can definitely tell the difference between each meat & cuts; They're all delicious! Definitely the highlight of the whole meal!!!  Spicy Horse Tartare ($16) - I kept thinking that horse meat would be tough at 1st but it wasn't after all! It's known to be a bit sweet & tastes like a crossover between beef & venison. It's a good tartare & the small amount of sauce helped to cover the gameyness of the meat.  Tongue on Brioche ($14) - Serve on French Bread. This was really delicious! The texture of tongue's of course a bit crunchy but it blends so well with their condiments. The Brioche's made nicely - the perfect compliment for the tongue. This was my 2nd favorite entree from there.  Overall - Black Hoof definitely lives up to the hype. The place isn't big or fancy, the portion isn't all that, but the food's def worth trying. The House Cured Meat & Tongue on Brioche're a must try. Spicy Horse Tartare's also good way to try horse meat.         ** 4 1/2 stars overall**"}
{"text":"Charcuterie, cheese & bread YES. Come here if you want those things. Delicious, high quality, and interesting stuff. The pickled vegetables were something new for both of us and we loved them. It was one of our favorite parts of our meal  This is a great spot to have a few drinks and some snacks with friends or on a date. Cocktails and wine list are great. The environment is cozy and warm as it's a pretty small place.  Service was perfect, our waitress was attentive and always came over when she noticed a drink getting low.   I had a great night here and will be back for sure! One of my favorite places so far"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, either for a romantic date night or a large group party, it's always an amazing experience. The food is spectacular and the service is impeccable. Totally craving the blue cheese cheesecake right now!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but it's more on the expensive side. I say expensive because the portion is small, more like a tapas style. Brought my staff there for dinner and we've tried a lot of dishes on the menu but none were that memorable. From what I could remember, the charcuterie was good, the Bone Marrow was a little too salty and the Nutella Foie Gras was a weird combination. Will I return? Maybe only if someone is having a party there and I had no choice to attend. I have to admit that I left there a little on the disappointed side after all the hype I've heard from the place."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many gastropubs, but if they are anything at all like Black Hoof, I'll need to start going to more. We heard that this is a pretty popular joint - and there's fairly limited seating - so we showed up a few minutes before opening time and were third in line to get a table. The menu with the day's offerings is on a chalkboard by the back, and they have a nice little drinks menu as well. Service is decent, with the food being brought out as it's finished. While you could probably order your own dishes, it's easy enough to share amongst others.  Holy cow - the food here is good. First, if you're the drinking kind, the Spearhead IPA is a really solid beer. Some IPAs are too light and don't work well, but this is a nice full-bodied pale ale that really is nice to sip on with the food. As for the dishes - there is some truly funky stuff on the menu that I probably wouldn't ordinarily try, but I gave it a shot. Tongue on brioche? I've never really thought about eating tongue when I've seen it elsewhere, but the meat is very thinly sliced and is extremely juicy and flavorful, and it works well on the slices of toasted brioche it's served with. Another daring try was the spicy horse(!) tartare, which turned out to be absolutely divine. I'm not a huge tartare person when it comes to meat (I prefer the seafood kind), but I'll be damned if this wasn't better than almost any other tartare I've had. The horse meat actually tasted a bit like tuna but with more depth to it, and the spicy sauce works really well to season the meat. The bone marrow was delicious - very rich and full of flavor, and it worked very well as a spread on bread. The last dish really blew me away - the foie gras with Nutella. Who the heck would ever think of putting those two in the same dish?! But as a dessert, it was incredibly mind-blowing. The rich fatty flavor of the foie gras amplifies the richness of the Nutella, and combined with the hazelnuts sprinkled on the side, is pure heaven. It's one of the more expensive desserts you'll eat anywhere (it's a cool $25), but it is worth every single (Canadian) cent.  I didn't have a chance to sample the higher-end fare when we were in Toronto, but I don't care - this has to be one of the most interesting restaurants I've visited, and they absolutely deliver on the quality of the food. It's not just unique for the sake of putting ingredients together you wouldn't think about - the food tastes absolutely incredible as well. When I'm back up in the Great White North, I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"One the best meals and service I had recently, hands down.   First we were greeted by a hostess that we filled with positive energy.  We waited for a table for about 1 hr (which was fine), so they took our phone number down and told us we should go to the Cocktail Bar across the street.   When we got our table we looked at the menu and I got really excited.  Black Hoof's menu is very eclectic, varying from blood custard, foie gras terrine and they're popular charcuterie board.. not to mention they make all the breads in house!!  We had the Foie Gras Terrine with some lingonberry reduction and house mustard with brioche, spicy horse tartar with hollandaise and fried potato threads, bone marrow with sourdough and finally the beef tongue sandwich which was AMAZING!!  Not to mention, that after every coarse the server would clear, wipe down the table and set new cutlery with persistence   Totally recommend this place, at the top of my list for sure."}
{"text":"Hands down....the BEST meal I had while in Toronto.  Not only was I surrounded by great company, but the food here was unique and phenomenal!!  All the hype about this place is true...make a stop here the next time you're in Toronto or you're seriously missing out!  From the spicy horse tartare (yes, it was my first time trying horse meat, let alone have it be raw) to the charcuterie to the scallop crudo to the bone marrow, everything was insanely flavorful and good.  I cannot think of one dish that we did not like, we seriously almost licked every plate until there was nothing left.  Menu is quite extensive with a good selection of alcohol, we literally wanted to order everything since they've all sounded so great!    To top it off...we had a foieberry shortcake for dessert.  Yes, you've heard right, FOIEberry!  Coming from CA, foie is usually a must-have anytime we travel out of the state.  Granted, it was a bit steep at $25 for a dessert, but it was worth every freaking penny!  The foie gras oil soaked well into the shortcake, making it o' so delicious!    Canadian $ or debit only, they do not accept credit cards or USD.  Being the rookies that we were, we only had US $ but everyone was so awesomely friendly that they did a 1 to 1 conversion to save us a trip to the bank.  LOVE this place, cannot wait for my next Toronto trip just to come back here!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday. At first, I wasn't impress that it was a 45 mins wait, however my BF really wanted to try this piece, so we decided to wait.  It was definitely different and worth the wait.   We started off with the House Cured Meat - it was good - but definitely too much for just 2 people to share (and no need to order the extra bread if it's only two people).  Next came the roasted bone marrow - which is amazing and definitely worth ordering. Had we not ordered so many other dishes, we would have ordered a second round of this. Who knew bone marrow could be this tasty!!  Then came the Spicy Horse Tartare, which we thought was intriguing, as we have never heard, so we had ordered it. When it showed up, it was like a salad. Wasn't bad, worth trying but probably only a one-time thing for us.  Tongue on Brioche is definitely another worth ordering. it is a sandwich that tasted like a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. SO GOOD that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tender. If it wasn't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up, we would have devoured it.  For dessert, we had ordered the Foie and Nutella, as we thought this was very interesting. It was good, but after 4 dishes already, this was just a little too rich. It came with banana bread that was really good.  Overall, definitely worth the try! Just make sure you bring cash =)"}
{"text":"When planning my recent trip to Toronto for a conference, the one consistent piece of advice I got was that the Black Hoof was a \"can't miss\" food experience. Knowing that they don't take reservations and prepared for a wait, I showed up with two friends who are equally enthusiastic about good food - particularly good food made of animal - and prepared to be amazed. While I thought they had a very interesting menu, I was disappointed with the food.   Service was OK, but nobody really went above and beyond. We put our names on the list and were told we could try waiting at the cocktail bar across the street - which was also packed, so we hung out on a bench outside. We were all trying to be careful about avoiding astronomical fees for international cell phone usage, but the hostess wasn't too keen on the idea of letting us run over to the restaurant without answering the call to tell us our table was ready. Weird, but whatever. A little more off-putting was her attitude when I checked to make sure she'd be able to send a text to us. \"We have this really impressive technology in Canada that lets us do that.\" Considering that I had to explicitly call my provider and request a plan that would allow me to send texts to international numbers, I thought it was a fair question. Whatever, girl sounded pretty confident that she wasn't going to be looking at a 60-cent-per-text charge for contacting us that way. In terms of service at our table, we weren't neglected but service was a little slow and we could go quite a while with unfilled water glasses.   The menu was more interesting than satisfying. We started with bread, pickles, and bone marrow. The bone marrow was delicious and a very generous portion. The pickled veggies had great flavor and there was a lot of variety, although the portion was very small (although most things were sized well for sharing, a second plate of pickles would not have gone amiss). The albacore tuna crudo had very intense flavor - so much that we all took a single bite. I'm glad I tried it, but the intensity might work best as a bite-sized amuse bouche than a full entree. We also had a dish with n'duja and leeks that was served with fried chicken skin - again, interesting flavor but very intense and a bite or two was quite enough. I also thought the dish was overly salty. We finished the meal with the pork carnitas - which were the least innovative thing we tried, but also the most delicious and satisfying. This led us to conclude that we might not be the target audience for this restaurant. Overall the three of us consider ourselves to be adventurous eaters - I have never shied away from trying a new food and usually love new flavors and textures. Black Hoof took the \"tip to tail\" concept just a bit too far for me."}
{"text":"I now get it.   After wanting to eat at the Black Hoof for years, I finally got my chance last night. My dinner companion and lady date friend K. was more excited than me to finally eat here. Even her boyfriend was excited for me. The Black Hoof definitely met with my expectations and I hope to make this \"meat palace\" a regular place to visit.   From what you've read, getting there early is a good idea. We were the first ones to arrive at 6pm and we were the only ones for a while. But the restaurant quickly filled up within the hour.   Everything I've read about the restaurant I experienced: the ambiance was nice and intimate; the music selection was great; the wine list was impressive; and the beer selection was good. We each had the Beau's Lagered Ale which was a good choice.   OK, the food. It's delectable, comforting, flavourful, fatty, luxurious, pleasurable... Have I included enough adjectives? But you get my point. Each dish raised the bar for the next dish.  We had: - House cured meats  - Bone marrow  - Spicy horse tartar  - Tongue on brioche  - Duck and black bean   It's hard to say which ones were my favourites but the tongue brioche just exploded with meat that melted in my mouth. It was the best meat sandwich I've ever had. The bone marrow was sumptuous: I would have sucked the juices from it if I wasn't in a public place."}
{"text":"No longer one of Toronto's best kept secrets, Black Hoof is slowly gaining a reputation as one of the best gastropub in the city to enjoy a cocktail & have some good food.  There's limited seating, and I'm told there's often a wait but let me assure you, it will be worth your time. There is also a limited menu, but don't let this fool you: anything you select will be delicious (they know what they're doing, and they do it well).  I came here with a friend and, between the two of us, we ordered the Roasted Bone Marrow, Albacore Tuna Crudo, Pork Carnitas Tacos & the Tongue on Brioche; everything was amazing, and I mean everything. The tongue on brioche reminded me of a more tender, creamy version of a Montreal smoked meat sandwich, the carnitas tacos were delicious (not the best I've had, but much better than I'd expected), the tuna crudo was fresh, and light... but the bone marrow, oh the bone marrow... I'm salivating just thinking about it. Rich and creamy perfection."}
{"text":"**4.5 STARS SOLID!  I couldn't sleep last night craving for bone marrow and foie & nutella, so I promised myself I would make a visit tonight.  Trotted in at 7:30pm this Friday evening and was quoted for 45-60 min wait, while we went over to the Trinity Bellwoods park to enjoy some fresh air.  We were sat in exactly an hours time and the server noted the market price for the marrow was $8.  Perfect!  I ordered that right away along with a double jacks on rocks and their house red, a Cote du Rhone.  Then came the hardest part of dining out- deciding what to get... I wish I had more than one stomach.  Bone Marrow: $8 m.p. (5/5 stars) A nice long split of greasy creamy calcium-rich goodness roasted to perfection, served with chimichurri, toasts, and (kosher?) salt.  I actually didn't need the extra salt as the chimichurri already gave it enough seasoning.  This alone might be the answer to preventing osteoporosis!  Spicy Horse Tartare: $16 (4.5/5 stars) served with the pickled milkweed pods and caper hollandaise. The spice is actually very mild, but manages to give it the little kick the horse needs.  The hollandaise is the bulk of the flavour, while the fresh herbs and crunchy hickory stix are the contrasting textures that finish everything off. (Missed the full 5 stars because I know a place that serves it just a bit better haha).  Foie & Nutella: $25 (4.5/5 stars) Picture this: banana bread perdu... topped with a generous chunk of foie gras... sprinkled with salted crushed hazelnut... all while sitting on a ginormous dallop of Nutella and a sour cherry syrup to dress!  This is breakfast, appetizer, and dessert in one!  Who woulda known?!  You sort of have to play around with proportions of all the components to your preference, 'cause I found that the taste of the actual foie can be easily masked by all the sweets.  My only criticism though is that this is very rich, and it needs something to counter that.  Anyone else agree?  Pork Carnitas Tacos: $11 (3/5 stars) Very simple pulled pork taco with cilantro, lime, and pork rind.  Yummy, but not over the top.  Hoof chefs (...choofs? hooks? hefs?) should consider its original pig's head taco haha.  Beef Tendon and Grits: $16 (2.5 stars) I enjoy tendon with hot sauce a lot, so I decided to give this a go.  I was presented with an interesting presentation of: 4 pieces of breaded deep-fried tendons in cubes, on a bed of white cheddar grits, and topped with rapini.  The grits were creamy and tasty, rapini was ever-so-slight over cooked, loved the Frank's Red Hot Sauce, but then tendon in the batter just didn't do it for me.  It was a bit too gluey, so it kinda stuck to the thick crunchy batter.  Felt like they were a bit too ambitious with this one, remember to Keep It Simple Stupid. The whole time I was wishing it was served with a big bowl of pho instead!  Service: (5/5 stars) As good as you can get at places alike.  They were friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive as they came by after every dish to clear, wipe, and reset, all the while NOT hovering over the table.  Just go!  The Hoof makes DELICIOUS OFFAL, AWFULLY DELICIOUS! (If Hoof chefs are reading, please put brains on the menu!  They usually look gross and scare me, and the one time I've had it, I was not a fan.  Please change my mind.)"}
{"text":"One word: meat.  Two words: best meat.  Seriously.  So I looked up a few places to go on a recent business trip to Toronto and this was one of the top places that most sites/articles pointed to - and they were all right.  I started with an experimentally prepared manhattan - one of the 5 best I've had (and I've had them in probably over 50 bars WW).  Then the food.    The Charcuterie plate is amazing.  The duck liver moose, duck \"lavendar pastrami\" and house made soprasetta are incredible - best ever.  The smoked sweetbreads tasted liked they were made with bacon - but really weren't - they were seriously the best I've had.  Further - I grew up in a Jewish Deli (seriously), the tongue here is amazing - only surpassed by 1 or 2 NYC delis that have been making it for decades.  It was incredible.  The duck heart tartare was great - can't say it was the best b/c I've never had duck heart anything besides here.    Lastly the wine list is very smartly selected and the by glass options are first rate (unlike most places) and the cocktails are expertly prepared.  The whole experience, attitude and \"culture\" is worth the wait, expense, effort and adventure.  Try it all."}
{"text":"The place is small, and I think the staff does an excellent job maneuvering around in a restaurant this size, and serving efficiently without making guests feel rushed.    I was with 3 other people, and we ordered several rounds of plates and cocktails.  We were incredibly indecisive, and our server was delightfully patient, not to mention helpful.  Everything from suggestions about the menu to advice regarding portion sizes, it was wonderful having her as our server.  Wish I could remember her name!   A stunning cocktail list.  Delicious food.  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes off-cuts!   My favourite dishes were the bone marrow and sweet breads!"}
{"text":"I had planned a required Black Hoof visit while on vacation in Toronto.   We walked from our Chinatown hotel, to arrive right at dinner's opening, and were easily able to get a table for 4 in the beautiful enclosed wooden back patio. Service was good, not pretentious, and we really enjoyed sampling unique, high-quality dishes that would be difficult to find in Indiana, including:  * Spicy horse tartare- my 1st time eating raw horse & hopefully not my last * Pickle sampler * Charcuterie plate- 6 different meats w. mustard & bread, best version of this offering I've ever tasted * Pork carnitas tacos- more so ordered for our picky co-diners * Tongue on brioche- huge, very tender, rich...to be cliché, \"melt-in-your-mouth\"; this came out last when we were pretty full, but we still managed to snarf it down.  I ordered the tea-infused gin cocktail, more out of curiosity, and thought it was pleasant (although not extraordinary).  For the variety of food we were able to try, the cost was not too exorbitant when split between 4 people.  I missed out on the bone marrow dish, and hope to sample it if I get to visit Black Hoof again. I am not certain of how native Toronto-nites (Torontonians?) would rate Black Hoof on the city's amazing restaurant spectrum, but from a Hoosier perspective, the visit was a rare, exceptionally tasty, 5-star treat."}
{"text":"It was wet and snowy, and I got there right at six to meet up with a friend. I had heard that it gets busy here and that six was the best time to get a table (I think they don't take reservations). And it's not a large restaurant, so I can see why I was told this. Sure enough, being the first person in the restaurant, I had no problems getting a table =)  But by the time we left, it was pretty busy.   I was pretty hungry and so everything my friend mentioned was good or wanted to try, I wanted to order. Having said that, at least one of us had enough restraint to say, \"lets order just a few things and then we can order more if we're hungry\" (it wasn't me =)...thank goodness, because it would have been disastrous. It would have been waaaaay more than we were able to handle.  Hummus and chicken liver - YUM! Soooooo large, that plate. We got that plate first and were still eating it by the time they cleared the table.  My friend didnt want to eat it because it was \"rich\" but I thought, \"hey, I love bone marrow\"...yeah, it was definitely rich. Very good, but pretty large. Could've used help on that for sure.  The sumac-cured char was excellent. It was definitely a good change of pace after the hummus and marrow (definitely after the marrow). It also wasn't overly large...which we really welcomed =)  We ended with the tongue on brioche. I don't remember the last time I had tongue, but it was not as rough as I remembered.   Overall, it was really good. I like this notion of eating the many different parts that we don't normally eat (being Asian though...I normally already do kinda eat all of these parts). But it was more that the dishes were cooked really well and tasted great. Flavour-wise, I thought all the plates were right on. The size was great (maybe even too large). Definitely come here to taste and share plates."}
{"text":"Vegetarians avoid! Meat lovers rejoice!  Blood pudding, liver and onions, tongue, sweetbreads and other \"nasty bits\" are all celebrated at this tiny spot on Dundas West.  My wife and I split three plates including the blood pudding and tongue sandwich. Our meal was delightful.  The blood pudding is served terrine style, but warm with a side of ketchup chips (which my bride swears are Canadian BBQ chips). Dipping the chips in the pudding is revelatory. I will order blood pudding/boudin noir/etc anytime it is on a menu and this was terrific.  The second dish we shared was a trio of carnitas tacos. In Canada. They were outstanding. Wonderful tortillas and perfect spice to the shredded meat.  Finally we had the tongue which came served as an open-faced sandwich on brioche. Imagine the silkiest corned beef you've ever eaten without the often off-putting flavors from the corning spices and you would almost be to the texture of this meat. It was simply heavenly.  The restaurant only takes cash and Canadian debit, so come prepared. Share, sample and savor."}
{"text":"Overpriced pretender to be an excellent restaurant. Ate there during weekend eve---place pretty empty. Went by an other eve to see if there is any waiting--none again--in fact mostly empty. Our group tried several different dishes and wines. Bone Marrow for $9 is a joke since it is half of one piece.  Food over priced. Small portions. Inexperienced staff and owner. Lacks proper kithcen. Very small tables. Very small primitive patio."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I have had in Toronto. Very interesting menu. The Bone Marrow was very interesting though I liked the Liver much better. We got a side of veggies and the broccoli was just MIND BLOWING. Would love to go back to try more of their dishes"}
{"text":"Every bit of hype you've ever heard about this resto (or its sister resto, Bar Isabel) is probably true.  I fell in love with Black Hoof.  Favourite place in Little Italy, by far  After reading reviews, I decided to come here for an early birthday dinner.  We arrived at around 6:30, and the parking near the area was actually..free.  We didn't see any place to pay and our car didn't get tolled, so... that was a convenient start to our trip :P  If you don't want to wait, definitely come no later than 6:30.  10min after we were seated (which, unfortunately was near the door so it was a little chilly) - people started coming in and the waitlist was started.  So glad we got a seat right away, thanks to our genius idea of Yelping to gauge the wait time :3  Anyways.. the menu is written on a black board near where we were sitting, and every dish there is meant to be shared.  Here are the delicious gems we had the fantastic pleasure of trying :D  Charcuterie: I am horrible with names and Italian sausages are no exception.  But just know there were 7+ of them and each one was a gift from the Italian culinary god.  This comes with bread (though it costs extra) and every little piece of cured meat as part of this charcuterie was a treat to my taste buds.  My favourite was the duck breast prosciutto - not sure how they made this but I'd eat it as part of lunch everyday for the rest of my life.  Yeah, it was that good *_*     Horse tartare:  Came with a raw egg on top, we were told to mash everything together.  The horse tartare was AMAZING.  This was my first time having horse meat and it was raw (obvi, hence tartare) but the chewiness and the explosion of flavours had me sold.  The meat was seasoned with god knows what and the meat was a little tangy and spicy- but MAN was it good.  I honestly don't know how else to describe it, you just need to try it.  Bone marrow:  This was a hyped dish at the Black Hoof AND Bar Isabel.  I thought it was alright.  It came with pickle fennel and salt to season, as well as bread.  The bone marrow itself.. just tasted like oil.  Maybe I am just unable to appreciate this cholesterol-happy dish, but if I didn't have the pickle fennel I wouldn't have understood the point of eat oil on top of bread.  I don't want to take away a star from the resto just because of this one dish, especially because it still tasted great after I added the side seasonings.    Beef heart & smoked fingerlings:  YUM.  Beef heart was cooked medium rare, smoked fingerlings were baked potato wedges that tasted fantastic with the sauce they sputtered on top of each wedge.  I am at a loss of how they make or season these unique meats, but they just taste spectacular.    Pappardelle with pig's blood sounded delicious as well but we were pretty full after our fourth dish (shared between 2 people) However, we still couldn't leave without dessert - which is different everyday, I believe.  We had the chance to try the .. okay.. cannot remember the name, but it was basically a perfectly baked brownie glazed with a maple syrupy coating and cinnamon ice cream on top.  The amount of sweet deliciousness is indescribable and.. if you can't tell already, I'm a huge fan of this resto.  I would try Bar Isabel the next weekend I'm free.  As good as it gets."}
{"text":"Ok, time to throw in my two cents on this clearly very trafficked venue. Now that this isn't the newest hipster joint in town, I was finally able to get a table within 25 minutes (and on a Saturday night to boot!)  First observations would be the ambiance: dark, and not nearly as concentrated by douche-bags as I expected. This place has begun to settle down a bit. I would also say the clientele tend to be more on the friends meeting up side than daters. But there were some there..   We had the cured meat plate to start. Overall it was pretty nice. Favourites were probably the dill beef, prosciutto (really subtle sweetness) and one of the other 50/50 force-meats with some anise-y flavour to it.   I couldn't resist the smoked sweetbreads (we split two entrees - this was my pick). The other was the tongue on brioche. The tongue was fantastic. So flavourful! The sweetbreads were not so good..  first of all, they were fried. this would not have been my choice cooking method. I've only had them once before but they were grilled and amazing. This time they just tasted like some average deep fried fare (maybe something you would get at a lousy izakaya bar - it was served with that funky mayo). We didn't even finish it :(  Overall, I'd say the place is pretty good, but I'm not sure I'de return at this point."}
{"text":"Quite a small restaurant that probably seats around 25 people max...in this case we had to sit by the bar but it wasn't too bad, at least we got to see our food being cooked  Got a bunch of savory coldcut meats with bread and it was pretty good and filling, loved the duck spread   We also ordered the bone marrow which everyone raved about but me and my gf didnt really appreciate or even likes it at all....no flavoured and look and tasted like fat, ya you read it correct fat, slimy, gooey and clear....this experience is gonna make me never to try bone marrow again!!!!!  In addition we got the scallops which was good but nothing out of the ordinary, it also came with like a blood sausage which was good too, salty and sweet"}
{"text":"Oh, the world of offal.    Being the adventurous eater that I am, I let them pick a couple of items off the menu for me to try.   - Sweetbreads  - Tongue on brioche  The presentation was picture perfect and each dish was wonderfully seasoned, and full of flavor.   The tongue reminded me of the smoked meat I had in Montreal, delicate and moist paired with brioche to be eaten open-face style.  I've heard about sweetbreads, and didn't know that sweetbreads was actually veal thymus glands. The taste was unique and texture was smooth and light.  Both recommended dishes were delectable. I was pleased to know that some of the menu items can be ordered as a half-order item if you're dining solo.  The earl grey cocktail was something I've never had before and reminded me of the drinks you can order at any of the \"of the moment\" restaurants with mixologists.  The service level was high and the staff were all really friendly. The restaurant had a trendy and hipster vibe to it."}
{"text":"Throwing my two cents into what appears to be a massive sea of pennies - this place is definitely popular on Yelp. We dragged ourselves over here on a Saturday - it a little out of the way for people like us who like to stay in the downtown core :P  We arrived right at 6pm when the opened and there was already a line out the door waiting for seats. It's not a very big space, but if you get there before 7pm you'll probably be able to be seated right away. The waitstaff were all very attentive and helpful.  We ordered the charcuterie, which was pretty good. I think it was a little bit of a shame that it didn't come with better bread - the bread that they give you is cold and very doughy, and I would have loved a harder cracker or thinner slice to go with the board.   The foie and pork liver pate was FANTASTIC. Ten stars for that. I think I started to drool when I ate it. So buttery and flavorful. I'm starting to salivate even writing this. Absolutely order it - a delicious chunk of heaven.  We didn't get the bone marrow, but literally everyone else around us did. It comes with two halves of a femur or some other large bone, and it's literally sizzling when it comes to you. Delicious smell.    Ravioli was a hugeee disappointment. After the pate and the charcuterie, we were expecting something really good, or at least, a good portion. Boy were we disappointing. There was literally five raviolis in our bowl and they were tiny. Wish we could have ordered something else instead.  Great place - must if you're in town."}
{"text":"There's not much to say about this place that hasn't already been said, but after finally making a trip to Black Hoof, I definitely get the hype.  I'd always been curious about this place, but as a veg I was apprehensive since going to a nice resto to fill up on bread isn't my idea of a great time.  We were lucky to have great service, no wait for a table and had a couple of different servers coming by to check on us, answer questions, etc. We had bread, pickles, cheese, pork carnita tacos (for my sis) and asparagus with morels. I ordered a Hoof Negroni which was worth its cost for the aroma of the drink alone - hands down one of the best drinks I've had in this city. The cheese board was surprisingly awesome - good portions and each cheese was paired with something equally delicious (pistachio butter may be my new favourite thing in the world). My sister raved about the tacos and I was beyond happy with the asparagus and morels. The asparagus was prepared perfectly (had that bright colour and crunch) and the sauce had a slight sweetness to it that balanced out the flavours in the veg and mushrooms. I'd love to go back just to try some more of their cocktails and perhaps check out the dessert menu."}
{"text":"Cocktails were amazing; The Gold Fashion, Old Fashion, Whiskey cocktail were all so good. Wasn't a fan of that big in Japan one, felt like I was drinking sesame oil. Ambience and service were great, smaller venue and intimate:)"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo busy. Be prepared to wait a very long time before getting a table. Good thing that their raw bar is right next door and it's not bad. We were a group of 4 and we ordered almost everything on the board. Everything was delicious, maybe they could be even more adventurous? Great place to share food, and have drinks with friends, also good for dates :) No complaints except for the wait time. The place is very small, and because it's more of a bar, people don't leave. A must try!"}
{"text":"Nothing short of genius. One of the best meals I've ever had. Amazing service, delicious wines.  The raw horse sandwich was tangy and delicious. We were a group of 8 and with that many you can order the whole menu. So we did and sat there all night eating.  In the end the chef came out and we gave him a standing ovation.  It was awesome."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and would absolutely go again.  Best foie gras I've ever had, and the cocktails are fantastic.  It's small, but that makes it better.  A more intimate and quieter experience."}
{"text":"First saw this restaurant on Anthony Bourdain show. My top two favorite was the bone marrow and fois gois. I would definitely come back when I'm back in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.    I dream of this restaurant.  The fact that I am now no longer living in Toronto, and thus no longer able to eat here makes me want to crawl into a corner and write sad poetry about first world problems.  And loneliness.  And wilting roses.  *All time favorites* (but keep in mind, everything is very tasty):  - CHARCUTERIE!   oh.my.god.  Can you say \"duck prosciutto\"?  EVERYTHING on that platter is amazing, even the heart!  Any place that can make me gush about heart is a winner.    - horse tartar.  Man....I grew up playing with Breyer horses and My Little Pony.  All of those memories went COMPLETELY out the window when I ate this dish.   Horse = tasty  - tongue on brioche.  UUGGGHHHHHHHHH.  (that is a good \"uggghhh\")  so amazingly good.  Tender, perfectly cooked slices of yumminess.  Seriously, if it weren't for the fact that I was always out in public while eating that dish, I'd have started talking to it Anthony Bourdain-style (for those of you who watched No Reservations, you know what I mean).    - ANY of their cocktails.  Genius.  Masterful.  Boozy.  Winners.    Go to this place, take photos, and make me feel super jealous."}
{"text":"Black Hoof is a great place to try some interesting cuts of meat. I wouldn't recommend that you come hungry since most if not all items are tapa-sized and you'll rack up quite the bill. Definitely try the charcuterie board, bone marrow and tongue on brioche. The cocktails are nothing special though.  No credit cards, no reservations."}
{"text":"Sampled the bone marrow, liver, chacuterie plate. All excellent. Meat lovers dream come true! Plus good beer on tap. Tried a hawaiian style brew. Very interesting beer with pineapple in it."}
{"text":"This is the \"Must try\" in Toronto. I especially recommend bone marrow and tongue on brioche.   Some of my friends couldn't accept some of the dishes, but I love trying new food and here is the best so far! I appreciate their effort and how they make those wonderful dishes. There is nothing else like here!   If you wanna check out more photos, plz come to my blog, http://lizzieh.pixnet.net/blog/post/280076789 (it's in Mandarin)"}
{"text":"Charcuterie was amazing w/ a side of bread.  The bone marrow was buttery goodness.  The goat cavatelli was amazing. Crumbles of goat meat mixed in w/ cavatelli and light melted cheese. Perfect balance of chewy and soft.  The foie gras & pancake was, hands down, THE best thing I ever ate. Two lovely pieces of foie gras on top of a small fluffy pancake. Smothered in blueberry compote & maple syrup and surrounded by Captain Crunch crumble. It had the right balance of sweet & salty. It was SO good, my friend & I came here twice while we visited Toronto... Yes, we came back the very next night just for this pancake!  You MUST come here if visiting Toronto. If you don't, you're definitely missing out. I kid you not."}
{"text":"Had dinner last night with a girlfriend. It's my second attempt there. The food is good as usual. We got the charcuterie board, bone marrow, foie & waffle 3.0 and the cinnamon ice cream & sticky top pudding for dessert.   My favourite is definitely the foie & waffle. Foie is so rich but when combining with peanuts butter and blackberries. It is just  right!!   Another thing to add on is the dessert. We r not a big fan of cinnamon. Once again the combination of the cake, caramel and cinnamon ice cream make a great combination.   Over all it was a great experience. $100 feed us really well. But for ppl who cannot live w/o veggi(like me), this place can only be a once in a while place.   The place got really packed after 8. Make sure u come early."}
{"text":"Wouldn't come here unless you are cool with meat on meat on meat.   Bone Marrow - With all the talk I was expecting something that stood out a little more. This was fine marrow.   Cochinita Pibil Tacos - Maybe our favorite thing. Popped with flavor. Good hot sauce.   Beef Heart w Snails - A bite of everything along with the greens was the best way to eat this. If you didn't get everything in one bite, it lacked flavor.   Smoked Pork Jowel - Think excellent bacon/pork belly. SO rich.   Foie and French Toast - On paper this was reminiscent to the foie biscuit that Animal does Los Angeles. Just didn't come together like what I was hoping for.   Cash only kinda sucks. Meat meat meat meat."}
{"text":"I tried the first Tartar of my life here. And it was HORSE Tartar!!!! Before I came to Black Hoof, I didn't even know horses are eatable. I mean, they are so adorable!! I felt a little bit bad for horses, but I also have to admit it was the best tartar I every tried until now, much better than beef tartar or duck tartar. The horse tartar was well-seasoned, extremely fresh, and I felt like it just melt between my teeth when I chewed it.   This place is extremely popular in Toronto and it seems alway packed. Thanks to one of my friends who just hang out in Downtown Toronto the whole afternoon, we got a very tiny table around 6:30. Remember, this place doesn't take reservation at all. And it only has couple tables available . A lot of people were just waiting outside on the street for a quite long time when I was eating. Therefore, if you want to get a table, better make sure you get here as early as possible. First come, first served. Also I don't think it is not a good place for a large group of people.   I also tried another dish call \"Fried Sweetbreads\". To be honest, I had no idea what Sweetbreads was, not to mention eating it. At first, my friend told me it was just fried chicken ball, and, call me naive, I actually believe them!! I tried it out, and it didn't taste like chicken a little bit. The texture was much softer than chicken. I had to use google to find out what \"sweetbreads\" was, and after seeing all the pictures of  raw sweetbreads, I lost my gut to try another piece. Don't take me wrong, the Fried Sweetbreads from Black Hoof was delicious and impressively yummy. I strongly suggest everyone to give it a try at least once in your life.   My experience in Black Hoof is \"exciting\", and I don't think there are many restaurants that are able to make me feel excited the way Black Hoof does."}
{"text":"Four stars for the most exotic, eclectic menu I've ever seen.  Service was not amazing and some food felt overpriced ($20 for 3 pieces of cheese??)"}
{"text":"I don't know. Maybe I'm too old school for this place. It was alright. I'm not a fan of bone marrow either, it tastes like bland, hot jello to me. I did try it here, even with the salt, too bland and gelatinous. Got the charcuterie plate, good. Didn't blow my mind away. They need to spice it up for me. The pork tacos were tasty. What was REALLY good was their Abbey Road cocktail. It tasted like a refreshing sparkling lemonade! Best part of the meal."}
{"text":"Excellent verity of unique foods, served quickly. Very high quality and worth a try for an adventurous eater!"}
{"text":"Casual place w unique small sized dishes for sharing. Good if u come w a group.  Tried some animal parts/\"meats\" ive never tried. (Beef) bone marrow- very fatty and oily. Ok. Horse tartare-reminds me of sashimi as its served w a sesame oil sauce and nori. Good but I prefer to eat raw fish instead. Asparagus w a type of cheese Duck foie w pork liver parfait spread-i like foie gras but dont care much for liver. Dont like the mushy texture much."}
{"text":"Black hoof lives up to its meat mantra! Tried interesting parts of animals dressed up in unique ways. Wasn't a big fan of the bone marrow personally - didn't taste like much to me. My highlight was the pistachio hummus and chicken liver! It was served with the freshest and crispest tortilla chips.  You'll need 3-5 tapas between 2 people to be full."}
{"text":"Def a good place for a group who don't mind sharing!  Even though there was an 1 1/2 wait time, they'll seat you next door for drinks and snacks.  If you like to adventure out of your comfort-zone, experience, or a meat-lover, I highly recommend this place.  Ranked in order of preference:  - Cochinita Pibil Tacos, it was so good we ordered more :p - Charcuterie, along with bread to complement it! - Bone Marrow - Fried Sweetbreads"}
{"text":"This place is a bit of an adventure...at least for me. I've never had charcuterie before and I'm not generally a big meat eater, so this was a little out of the box. That said, I like trying to be adventurous and trying new things, so when are visiting friends suggested we give it a go, we went for it. Dinner service is open at 6pm, so we agreed we'd arrive at 6pm. We got there at about 6:15....there was already a HUGE wait for a table, but we managed to wrangle seats at the bar.   The four of us ordered a bunch of dishes to split between ourselves. We tried the charcuterie (sort of a platter of assorted sliced meats and pâté), horse tar tar, roasted bone marrow, pork carnitas tacos, tongue on brioche and the foie gras and nutella for dessert.   The dishes came out staggered, so we got to sit around chatting and enjoying ourselves and our cocktails. The charcuterie came out first. It was assorted sliced meats arranged on a wood plank and served with bread. It was actually really nice. Next was the horse tar tar. This was a stretch for me. I don't generally like to eat animals that I LIKE. The people I was with convinced me to try a small bit and I must say, it tasted pretty good, but on principle, I just have trouble with it. Sorry! I hate being one of those people who doesn't have a problem killing the \"ugly\" animals, but doesn't want the cute ones to die...but I am.   Next was the bone marrow, which was....well let's just say I had to keep telling myself not to think about what I was eating. Basically, it's a big bone and the marrow is of course in the middle and has been cooked so that it's almost the consistency of warm butter...pretty fatty and oily looking. You scoop it out with a spoon and put it on bread. It's actually delicious, but feels like you're eating something you shouldn't, purely for health reasons if nothing else! It feels like eating pure fat....tastes as good I suppose.   We had the tongue on brioche, which I was only okay with. The tongue was sliced and presented as a sort of Montreal smoked meat. We were told to open it up and eat it like an open faced sandwich. This made it easier to split certainly. The meat itself was very tender and the brioche was great, but the meat had a horseradish (I think) sauce, which was a bit overpowering.   Finally we had the tacos, which was probably the more \"normal\" thing we had. I actually thought those were my favorite. Wish it was one of the more exciting things, but nope. Those tacos were excellent.   The foie gras with nutella was also delicious. It was served on a banana bread, over a nutella spread...but the fois gras was superflous. It didn't add any taste and was overpowered but the nutella and basically didn't add anything to the dish. Could have been served without. Clearly just added to SAY it was there.   So what's the overall opinion? Well, the restaurant is too small. It's REALLY small, but popular. Wish it was in a bigger location. Sitting at the bar was kind of interesting, because all the cooking was done behind the bar, but that was a small workspace and it got hot, because the oven, dishwasher, stove top and so forth were always turned up very hight. Impressive how they work in such a space though.  Overall the food was very good. SOMEONE knows what they are doing. However, it is quite a pricey place and as I said, sometimes the flavours overpower the meat, or the meat just isn't even necessary. Sometimes you're paying extra for fancy meat dishes that don't even need the meat, or where you can't TASTE the meat.   Those are the only criticisms, but I wouldn't let that keep you from trying this place...but only if you're willing to go out on a limb a bit and as something different. This isn't a go-to place, but it's a fun place to have gone to!   Oh...PS - They don't accept credit cards. Only debit or cash."}
{"text":"Came here after hearing all the hype about this place. Decided to try a few things: Oxtail and scallops, rabbit pappardelle, bone marrow, charcuterie platter and olives.  By far what stood out to me was the oxtail and scallops, and the bone marrow. Delicious! The other dishes weren't all that great and seemed a bit more plain - yes, this is possible even at the black hoof. I did not try the horse, I will return with this as my mission, perhaps a better review will follow.   Regardless, I'd say overall I enjoyed my meal and I'd gladly return to try something else (Horse)."}
{"text":"There was no wait for a table for 3 on a Friday at 7pm.  Sweet.  Great experience at the Black Hoof.  We shared all four tapas styled dishes and was satisfied.  We started with the Charcuterie with a small order of bread, followed by the Bone Marrow with sea salt & caper relish, the Oxtail Fritters & Scallops and the Foie & Waffle.  The Oxtail and FoieWaffle was most inventive - great balance of sweet, tart and savory along with crunch, softness and bite.  Friendly, unpretentious and helpful staff.  Oyster Raw bar next door."}
{"text":"This is home to one of the most eccentric and creative menus that I've encountered. The uniqueness makes Black Hoof a must stop for dinner in Toronto.  We started with pistachio hummus with chicken liver. There was something ingenious about this dish. Conceptually, it was a sort of Turkish fusion. Each bite had a wide range of textures starting with the creaminess of the hummus to the crispiness of the chicken liver and finishing off with the crunchiness of the pistachios.  Next, we had the horse tartar. This is a must order simply because of the uniqueness. I've never seen this anywhere else in the world.   For the main course, we split a special - the heirloom tomato salad with buffalo yogurt. This dish was similar in methodology to the first starter but very different in terms of concept and ingredients. It showcased a great range of flavors and tastes.  The service is great and you can't go wrong with the beer menu here! Note, they only accept cash and Canadian debit."}
{"text":"Let me start my review with I have been wanting to try the Black Hoof for years and so happy that I got to experience real cooking while staying in Toronto. I knew about Cocktail Bar (same owner) across the street and it was an amazing start to an even better evening. Came to Black Hoof knowing that they specialize in what others call adventurous eating but that is exactly what my girlfriend and I enjoy. Menu items can change based on what is fresh which is always a good sign. They have odd hours and do not take reservations so make sure you check the website. We sat down for dinner at 8:00pm and the place was pretty full but we were seated immediately. Great place to come with more than two people based on my experience, we were the only couple. When you group up you can try more of the amazing food.   Started with a few cocktails while we looked at the chalkboard menu near the outdoor patio. Too cold that evening to sit outside for us. The cocktails were the same quality as Cocktail bar so we were extremely happy so far. We knew one thing, to start with the charcuterie board and a basket of bread and pickled vegetables. This is a must and not joking was on every table I could see. We had goat, pig, beef, horse, chicken fat, terrine..you name it we had it. Great bang for your buck to and awesome with the bread and veggies for your first course. Had some more cocktails because hell why not we are on vacation.   Asked the waiter what they recommend, horse tartar which is illegal in the states so we were curious or the smoke pork jowel which seemed appetizing. Opted for the pork based on the recommendation and WOW. Literally one of the best things I have ever eaten. Meat butter in your mouth and tasted like pork candy! Served with an applesauce/honey mustard sauce was perfect with some bread.   We knew anything we ordered would be amazing based on the first two courses so we opted for desert. The desert changes but that day was a panacotta with a raspberry sorbet on top and again so good!  Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food, atmosphere and service which are all superb. The open kitchen gives it a nice touch. They cook on one electric stove and I do not know how they produce this amazing food in a kitchen no bigger than my bathroom. One of, if not the best meals we have ever had. Please see my pictures on Yelp if you want an idea of what a great meal should look like."}
{"text":"I don't normally give places 5, but i'm giving it to black hoof just for their creativity.   If you want to have a weird food nite, this is another interesting place. The concept of the place is recession meat. Basically, two of toronto's top chefs got together and made a restaurant that highlights the parts of the body we don't normally eat, like tongue, heart, liver, brain. It sounds bad, but the food is really good.   It's also open till 12.30 in the night which is nice too. No need to make a reservation. In my experience, ppl are hesitant to go there, but once they do, they are intrigued.  Me and my friends to go here   because we grew up eating stuff like this (the bone marrow is amazing). The cow tongue is like buttered pastrami, and the charcuterie plate is just fun. The only thing is, the menu is made up of many small items (kinda like tapas style I guess). I usually spend about $30-$50 there."}
{"text":"Just a q quick review. I found the food to be really great. Delicious combinations of old and traditional French and Portuguese ingredients arranged in a very creative way.  Their cold cuts are a must, very fresh. If you like foie gras, have the one with the blood cake on the bottom. I wasn't very impressed with the steak tartare but it was good. Good variety of original wines from many places and the cocktails were really attractive. The pace looks like a really serious place   My only negative comment is that they do not accept credit cards and that is not something that a restaurant that is serious about being the best, does. C'mon Black Hoof you are ready to be among the big ones!"}
{"text":"How do we start this review? Should it be by stating the fact that both the duo and the better half's brother drove 9 hours prior to dining? Perhaps that we had scoured the Internet searching for the most exciting menu in all of Toronto?   Yeah, driving 9 hours to Toronto should do it ...  I was a little worried about showing up to a spot as popular as the Hoof at 8 o'clock on a Saturday night, but low and behold we were sat within minutes of walking in ... and with a smile. Always a great start.  On first impressions, it was killer -- it felt as if we had only crossed the river and snuck into Brooklyn for a bite. But, upon noticing all the local beers on the line and in the bottles, we were assured that we were in Toronto. (Perhaps they were throwing Kudos to their southern brothers by offering Brooklyn Lager by the bottle?)  It was not hard for us to decide on our menu for the evening and with a lil help from the top notch service, we were off..  House Cured Meats - so the crew does all the curing/aging on site which is impressive all by itself and ya know what? It shows. Coming from a former salumeria expert, these guys can slice. The head cheese mortadella was divine as was the duck prosciutto -- a very special meat (insert joke here)   Bone Marrow w/chimmichuri - we had all never seen a bone marrow dish served like this. A bone which had to have been a foot long with moist and succulent marrow oozing out of the sides ... and pairing it with a chimmichuri? Genius ... talk about food porn  Blood Pudding - A suggestion from our server, and a good one. Not to say it was a perfect dish, but stellar nonetheless. I found it to be rich in texture and consistency ...  Calf Brain, Artichoke and Ricotta Ravioli - The STAR OF THE SHOW ... I could have had 17 1/2 more portions of this dish. It left me thinking that I may or may not be a zombie. Between the subtle salt from the artichoke and the creamy ricotta you'd have never know the cerebral cortex of some young bull was lurking in there ... heaven. Please send them to jersey.  Beef Carppacio w/ shaved Foie - A stellar dish with some of my favorite textures of the evening. The crunch of the shaved foie and the slight bitterness of the celeriac ... yes please.  Foie Gras & Pudding - The finale to the event and a terrific way to wrap it up ... a visually perfect dish and foie-tastic to boot. What I regret not asking was where they get the foie from ... we are used to enjoying Hudson Valley foie and this seemed to have a different feel as well as taste. We mean that in a good way of course...  I feel like i could go on more, but we are on yelp so I will refrain ... We are pretty sure that Jen sat us, and we only know this after doing post research and seeing some pictures on the site. Thanks Jen -- you have a gem of a restaurant.   What we do know for sure is that Brandon is a serious Chef. We had front row seats to his skills and it was a treat. Working in a kitchen not much bigger than a Fiat with a crew of 3 including himself and putting out some seriously impressive grub. Talent. Making it look effortless? A talent in itself. I didn't want to interrupt him to much in his conversation but I was proud to steal a fist bump out of him.   Our only wish is that we could make the trip back every weekend.   Thanks Black Hoof - you're flippin awesome."}
{"text":"Been here several times in different occasions, liver onion dish is hands down my one of the best dishes ive had. That maple sauce and foie is just a killer combo! Dont forget to order extra bread for this dish!  Menu changes once in a while which is pretty dope to try new killer dishes. Cheers guys!"}
{"text":"Nice unique place to go. The wait staff was friendly and prices are reasonable. It's not for everyone but I think it's worth a try.  I especially like the bone marrow and the foie gras pancake with maple syrup. I had a great time. I'm giving it 4 stars because they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"PROS + Interesting, unique menu + \"Uncommon\" meats - e.g. beef heart, horse, tongue, sweet breads  CONS - Cash or Canadian debit only - no credit cards - Very stuffy & hot inside on a summer day - Sangria was watered down and strangely carbonated   TIP: Dishes are best for sharing for 2-3 people   Came on a Friday evening at 7pm as a party of 3. We were seated at a 2-person table along the wall, with the 3rd person sitting awkwardly at the side of the table, blocking the walkway to the back patio. The table was way too small to accommodate 3 people. Indoor seating is limited to a few tables near the window and a few in the back - sitting indoors is a bad idea if you have a group of 3 or more. To make things worse, it was extraordinarily hot inside and they would not allow us to open the back door to air the place out.   We ordered bread + 4 other items on the menu to share between the 3 of us:  BEEF HEART & MUSSELS Flavorful slices of beef heart underneath a bed of mussels tossed in a creamy sauce, with a few sprigs of frisee on top. The beef heart did not taste gamey and was actually quite delicious and flavorful. I did not care much for the creamy sauce covering the mussels - it overpowered the seafood. The frisee was a nice touch.   ROASTED BONE MARROW What seems to be the most popular item on the menu. We paid $8 market price. Comes with one ~6-inch (~15cm) long bone cut lengthwise in half and 4 slices of crusty bread. Delicious with the chimichurri sauce and a sprinkling of sea salt. Probably enough to share reasonably between only 2 people.   BURRATA & ASPARAGUS SALAD One of my favorite dishes of the night. Creamy burrata sits on a slice of polenta/cornmealy cake, topped with lightly blanched asparagus & celery, and pickled shallot. Everything in this dish was very flavorful. Did not care much for the celery though and wish they used more asparagus instead.  CHEESE PLATE I do not remember the exact cheeses on our board from that evening but the cheeses were thoughtfully paired with the 2 jams & peanut butter. Also comes with a few slices of apple, and what they fancily called \"dehydrated grapes\" on the stem - aka raisins... -_-    For drinks, I did not get a chance to try their cocktails (which I should have). My group wanted to get a pitcher of sangria. For $45, we got a 1L pitcher of terribly watered down and *carbonated* \"sangria\". I've never had sangria with soda in it and it really just watered down the wine and made it taste bland. Also, the sangria was room-temperature and the pitcher contained no ice. Terrible.    I would come back to try their cocktails and to try some of their other more unique meat dishes - e.g. the horse tartare, sweetbreads, or tongue. The beef heart is also worth getting again."}
{"text":"VIBE  I feel like I would lose my Yelp credibility if I didn't post a review but I hadn't been back to The Hoof in over a year. So now is the time!  They have a new chef named Patrick who left after Brandon. It will be interesting to see how the Hoof evolves but for me, it still seems same old. It's simple decor in here. I'm a big fan of the black damascas wallpaper. Service is always ace here, though sometimes the food runners speak really fast so especially with your charcuterie, you're kind of like \"Whaa?\" but it doesn't matter because it tastes good anyways.   WE ATE  Charcuterie - still tops but please get rid of the mortadella. Ugh. I'm not sure which is worse baloney or mortadella. We also split the foie and nutella on banana bread. I loved the mix of flavours together. It's kooky but it works. In the past, I've had the tongue on brioche, cheese plate and bone marrow. All good choices. You can't go wrong here.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Perfect place for a unique meal with a casual vibe. Worth the wait plus they have this toasty area in between the main door and sliding winter doors. It's where I take my out of town guests. On the Near. Afar. tour."}
{"text":"This place is over rated and too expensive. I would pick Bar Isabel over this. The food is okay... so I was not too impressed."}
{"text":"The place to go for outside-the-box food. Horse Tartare and Bone Marrow are personal favorites. I'd give them a higher rating but their prices prevent me from stuffing myself when I visit."}
{"text":"This is place is an experience!  The restaurant is divided in three locations, two next to each other and one in front. Raw bar, Charcuterie and cocktails. The Charcuterie had an hour and half wait, so we decided to wait at the Raw bar, not a bad wait, we had the raw oysters and the cured fish platter, It was AMAZING! For drinks you must try the English tomato, a new twist of bloody merry ... that alone is an experience. Anyways after the long and incredibly delicious wait, we got a table at the charcuterie. Each dish was to die for, we had the bone marrow, the charcuterie platter, pork belly, the vegetable plate and a desert ...  the bone marrow and the vegetable plates where my favorites. YES vegetable plate, it has cheese, wine reduction and mushrooms ... just try it you will understand. For desert we really wanted to have the foie gras waffles, it was just too much, so we decided to have the small desert of the day. It was one of the best deserts I ever had! We then went on to the cocktail bar, the drinks where great, it's hard to describe just go! The only negative about this place is that they only take cash or Canadian debit cards. It did not matter that much. Even if they only took gold bars, I would still go there."}
{"text":"My best girlfriend and I are real carnivores.  We're both from cultures that eat a lot of meat, and good meat at that, so when we heard about the Black Hoof, we were more than excited.  We went in September, for her birthday, and before the second plates arrived, we knew we'd be back.  We ordered a ton of food.  Prosciutto, the charcuterie sharing platter, tuna tartar, pork tacos, pig heart salad, the tongue sandwich, and more.  Not a thing wasn't absolutely delicious.  The prosciutto absolutely melts on your tongue, and the charcuterie was some of the best I've ever had.  I even liked the spicy mustard and I am NOT a mustard fan.  When the bill came, we were pleasantly surprised.  We were expecting it to be a really pricy night out, but we fed 5 hungry girls for about $35 a head.  Prices only seem high until you realise that you're sharing everything!  Service was also excellent.  My water glass was seldom empty and the waiter was extremely attentive.  Thumbs up all around!"}
{"text":"In celebration of my 400th yelp review, I bring you my experience of eating horse meat tartare!  Step right up, folks! I ate horse for the first time - and it was raw. And it felt like eating sashimi.  As I was sticker shocked for the prices at this establishment (and I thought NYers dont get sticker shocked anymore?), I think the food here is exceptional. The waiter was hot and I was having a lot of girl talk going on. There's not much to not like!  I can't remember what else I ate - however I know that it was good.  This meal was so memorable because I had the biggest and most annoying heartburn after eating horsemeat. I guess, that's me taking it for the team.  Go. If your date is not hot, at least you can stare at the waiter, with reckless abandon."}
{"text":"Dark and crowded bar that serves food which is listed in chalk on a board in the back. Cool for one time. 2 times? Nah."}
{"text":"Really excellent food, good drinks, great vibe. Not exactly vegetarian friendly and not for the faint of heart! Lots of adventurous stuff like horse tartare, sweet breads, tongue, and heart. But if you're down for tasty animal parts, you'll be far from disappointed.  My boyfriend and I came here for a special dinner and it really made our night. We arrived not too long after opening hours so we were happily surprised to be seated quickly. The no reservations policy that many restaurants have these days can make wait times extremely long. We ordered a bunch of plates to share: small charcuterie board with pickles, pork tacos, and a sausage and peas dish which I think is no longer on the menu, or could have been a seasonal special/special of the day. To put it simply, the entire meal was exceptional. Flavours were well balanced and just plain tasty. We were very satisfied. Any explanation of the dishes here would not be enough, just go and try it for yourself. I did order a drink and it may have been the lowest point of the meal, however it was still a good cocktail. Called \"tea and sympathy\", it was supposed to be an Earl Grey and gin cocktail with jasmine and honey flavours. It sounded great, but fell a little flat for me. The flavours didn't stand out as well as I had expected, but that might just be my taste and it could be a delicate drink. Criticism aside, I sipped it quite happily. The thing that really made this place so charming  was to see that they employ a domestic electric stove in the kitchen area. Really drove home the point that their dishes are uncomplicated, and just honest good food.  I'd love to come back and try other menu items. Hands down, one of the best meals I've had."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come to Black Hoof for years, but as I live in a different province, I don't get much opportunity. Well, I was in town for the weekend and going out for supper with my sister. I gave her the option of choosing the restaurant and she knew I wanted to go here so it's where she chose. I was so excited.  We came at suppertime on a Saturday night, so no surprise that there wasn't a table open. They kindly suggested a visit to the BH owned cocktail bar across the street. We had time for one quick drink before we were called back.  The menu looked amazing and we chose three dishes that intrigued us, plus a sure to please cochinitas pibil tacos. We probably should have skipped the tacos and got another interesting dish. They were really great, but pretty tame.  We also ordered pigs ear slaw, bison heart terrine and horse tartare. All were quite excellent and disappeared quickly. My favorite was the terrine, which was good on it's own, but came with an amazing sweet mustard which really accentuated the terrine's flavour.  For drinks, I had a couple craft brews. First a draft Dieu du Ciel Immoralité which was quite good and then a Le Trou du Diable Sang-d'Encre which I had had before. Both were excellent additions to the meal.  There are so many good restaurants in Toronto, but the Black Hoof deserves a repeat visit just so I can experience the charcuterie platter and maybe some bonen marrow if it's still on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious fancy cocktails, great charcuterie, great plates made of weird things like tongue and organs. The idea of ordering a tongue sandwich sounds gross but it's delicious if you don't think about it too much.   Everything tasted great. Sitting at the end of the bar near the kitchen is fun if you like to watch.   Drinks are great, and the food, for what it is--leftover, undesirable animal parts--is delicious.   A good choice if you want to try something like this. If you're looking for amazing traditional dinner, this isn't it, but it's amazing in its own way."}
{"text":"Call me a romantic but there is something lovely about an open kitchen with household appliances, that can turn out food this good. Black Hoof is what's right in the restaurant world.  Unpretentious yet luxurious. I can sit here and list every dish, by dish, but there isn't any point.  This place is good.  It's damn good.  And I have yet to find a restaurant in Toronto to top it.  For an ambiance this inviting and food still creative and adventurous but still restraint enough to not slip in to the world of food cliches and done to death fads, you have to come here."}
{"text":"Vegetarian? Turnaround. You might find a sprig of green somewhere buried on your plate, but this place is for meat lovers. This place has been an institution for us carnivores and started from humble beginnings.   Bone Marrow - Check. Horse Tartare - Check. Foie Gras on errrthang - Check. Tongue on Brioche - Check.   My one slight is that their menu doesn't change up all that often.. which can be a good thing to some. I'd like to see them switch it up a bit though."}
{"text":"Foie and French toast.   You know, the way most Friday nights get started. OK, not really, but if I lived in my own utopia this would be on the regular menu.   Black Hoof is, as expected, all about the meats. And cheeses. And dranks. You could start or end your evening here and either way, it'll be a rich, indulgent experience.   But back to the F&FT dish that our table shared... it was everything one might expect from a savory sweet meat treat. Could I have eaten the whole thing by myself? But of course! Dishes this rich are meant to be shared over moans and groans of delight. What else would one expect?  Yes. Very much yes."}
{"text":"One of the best places to enjoy meat dishes. Highly recommended are the horse tartare, the foie gras, and the hummus. Bone marrow is delicious but I feel like you can do that easily at home, just soak in water/milk overnight to remove smell and blood, and roast it off. Finally before I forget do yourself a favor and order the charcuterie board... One of the best bang for your buck boards anywhere ... In the world.:)  BTW The cocktails are VERY pricy so unless you are dying for alcohol I would recommend against ordering it. I told the waitress to recommend a drink and didn't really pay attention to the price. It turned out it was 30 dollars.  For that price I could have drank water and enjoyed a few more dishes"}
{"text":"I've been on a real \"varietal cuts and nasty bits\" kick ever since I popped a big, slithery, bloody beef tongue into a brine for 10 days. Sweetbreads, lamb's hearts, and deviled kidneys followed. I'm an offal man, and I make my butcher work hard.   We could only make the brunch. The menu is small, simple, and imaginative. Our party ordered the veal heart and eggs, the beef tongue eggs benedict, and the breakfast cassoulet, and a mackerel hash. The waitress was patient, and knowledgeable; answering all of our questions.  It was all incredibly fresh, and flavourful, although a bit heavy for some members of our table. It's true. My \"tongue benny\" had ample servings of shaved beef tongue with ample hollandaise sauce. A very good recipe for a food coma."}
{"text":"AMAZING. the tongue brioche is out of this world tasty, and the house cured meats made us all smile, especially when we started digging into the lardo.  finally, the perogies. wow. best perogies ever.  the servers are laid back, very knowledgeable, and friendly.   AND  the drinks are fantastic. i've had a lot of manhattans, and $16 is a WTF price, but their manhattan is one of the best i've tried, ever."}
{"text":"I came to the Black Hoof with my girlfriend after just wandering along Dundas West trying to decide where to eat.  Any place that says \"Charcuterie\" on the awning immediately grabs my attention, so we thought we'd give it a try.  We split the crispy duck tongue salad and the large charcuterie place.  I myself loved the duck tongue salad, but my girlfriend isn't quite as big a fan of mayonnaise, and the dressing had loads of it.  The duck prosciutto in the salad was probably the tastiest of the meats we had that evening.  The charcuterie plate was also delicious, with rustic mustard to go with the variety of meats and a good sized plate of bread on which to sample these cured meats.  It was all delicious, but left me feeling slightly unsatisfied.  It don't know if I'm cheap, or expect too much, but for $25, I think there should have been a bit more to the charcuterie dish.  If it were priced at $20, then I think the quantity would have matched the price.  If I could, I'd give this place 3.5 stars, but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt because of the atmosphere and service, both of which were top notch."}
{"text":"It's fine. I thought it'd actually be better than this. It is very good, yes. It's pretty basic stuff, not exactly the New Canadian I was after. The backyard patio is cute and our server was nice. I wouldn't go again, and I wouldn't recommend tourists from NYC to come here. Locals and people who don't have places in the similar mode, yeah."}
{"text":"This was the first Gastropub I've ever been to, and I am in LOVE.  I was in Toronto for a weekend visit, and having never been there, I looked to Yelp for dining recommendations. I'm so glad I found Black Hoof.   I knew this place was going to be packed on a Saturday night, so we were prepared to wait (even went at 10pm to make it a little easier). However to our surprise, my boyfriend and I were seated almost immediately, since a corner spot on the bar opened up. Not the best seats for eating, but beggars can't be choosers.   The bartender/waitress had the cutest British accent and was nice attentive enough on a full house. We ordered a couple different drinks, but my favorite by far was the Tea and Symphony cocktail (i think that's what it was called).   I was drawn in immediately by the array of strange meat options on the menu and ordered an immense amount of food: everything everyone here suggested. loved every single one. Started out with the charcuterie, which featured the most beautiful slices of miscellaneous meats, all cured in-house. Followed by the butteriest, bone marrow ever; served with bread and flavored salts. The fish tacos were the most delicious tacos ever. We even ventured out and tried the horse tartare, as per recommendation, and this was my boyfriend's favorite. My favorite was the beef tongue brioche. A juicy, generous pile of thinly slice tongue, between two slices of perfectly toasted brioche. AMAZING.  Only regret is being too stuffed to order the foie and Nutella. Kicking myself now for not getting it.   All the dishes came out one after another, without overlap or waiting. Best part was after ALL of that food AND multiple cocktails, our bill came out to be a surprisingly low number.   If you're ever in Toronto, do not pass up this joint. Worth the wait, worth the money. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"On one of my trips to Toronto I decided one night I really wanted to do it up big and eat an amazing meal. However they don't have Blimpie out there, so I had to ask Yelp for some help.   Glad I did. Top rated EVERYTHING in Toronto is The Black Hoof. I feel like it's their version of Traif.   I came here several years ago before it blew up and brought a native Torontonian who had never heard of the place. She was impressed.   We came on a Saturday night and were told it was going to be a real long wait, Boooo. We were then told we could wait at their own personal cocktail bar across the street, YAY! Located directly right across the street, it's a great spot to have pre dinner drinks. If you intend to have drinks before dinner, come here knowing you'll wait and grab some across the street till your table is ready. Candle lighting, awesome drinks and a beautiful interior. Reminded me of many cocktail bars back in Brooklyn.  After some great drinks we strolled across the street for some grub. We talked to the staff to ask what they thought. The people who work here were super friendly. Some of the best hospitality I've experienced. Bread and Cheese were good. It paired real well with a Brooklyn Lager. I honestly felt like I was in a restaurant back home. Same vibe and feeling. People who genuinely cared about their craft, who wanted to cater people without some pretentious BS. The highlights were the Tongue on Brioche and  the Bone Marrow. Delicious. I highly recommend.   The Black Hoof is a must for anyone living or visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"Showed up around midnight to grab some drinks and snacks.  However, their kitchen was closed.  So we stuck with the drinks.  I am from DC, and it was a Sunday night, but i thought the area (Dundas) looked really sketchy and i was a tad skeptical about sticking around.  However, knowing that some of the best finds in a city are not in the financial district or in the touristy parts, we stayed.  ordered the No New Friends and i cant remember the name of the other drinks we ordered, haha.  must have been a lot of fun!  but they drinks were a bit pricey, however, i was okay with the prices after i saw the style and passion the bartender put into making the drinks.  she tasted each drinks (not directly) before serving it.  the drinks are STRONG and tasteful.    Staff was nice, ambiance was fantastic.  loved it.  even though they didnt offer food at that hour, the bartender/waitress offered nuts to eat while we drank.  i think this place is a great find and i will definitely be back on my next trip to TO!"}
{"text":"On a recent Saturday we dined at the Black Hoof with another foodie couple. We arrived at 6:30PM and we're seated immediately, the room filled up quickly after which the hostess managed a waiting list for tables, people waiting were mostly accommodated in the newly opened Hoof Cafe across the street.   The menu changes frequently and is written on a chalkboard on the wall. Service was friendly and efficient, our server was very knowledgeable about the menu items and answered several questions. Black Hoof describes itself as a charcuterie, as other reviews have pointed out this makes for a very meaty menu. We started with bread and olives and a large (10 item) charcuterie platter, which arrived promptly, the server carefully explained each of the items on the platter which were arranged in order from mildest to strongest. All were delicious. There were three pates, some delicate fatty pancetta and a very Catalan style selection of sausages mostly from iberico pigs.   For wine we had a Spanish Temprinillo off of a \"bin end\" wine list that went very well with the charcuterie.   We then ordered several items off the main dish side of the menu, Testina, scallops in bone marrow sauce, tongue sandwich, octopus with n'duja and pasta and seared foie gras. All 4 diners were sharing each dish and they were happy to facilitate with extra side plates. The octopus was tender but underwhelming and the pasta quite blah. The testina (a sort of terrine made by poaching all of the meat from a pig head) was delicate but a little bland, the tounge tender and tasty but the star dishes were the scallops and the foie.   More wine was in order and we found that they were serious about the \"bin end\" thing, our bottle had been the last they had so we switched to an Italian primitivo. We also ordered more food, another round of the scallops and the foie and a round of roasted marrow bones from the appetizer menu. Marrow bones are a bistro standard and these were a note perfect version although this dish is usually served with cornichons and parsley salad and these were found wanting here.   Service throughout was attentive and friendly without being cloying and at no time did we feel the slightest pressure to give up our table.    We finished with their only dessert, a goat milk panna cotta with cookie crumble that was really quite disappointing.   So to sum up, each diner had two appetizers and we shared 7 main dishes and one dessert, cocktails before dinner and three bottles of wine. Total bill for the table before tip was just under 100 each.  Dessert aside even the misses were decent and the hits were amazing.   One warning, Black Hoof does not take credit cards but they do take debit.  We splashed out and managed to run the bill up but one could also be a little more restrained in ordering, a couple ordering a single app and a single main each and one bottle of wine could easily dine for 50 dollars or less each and be very well fed.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered: Horse tartare, Bread, and Pistachio hummus & chicken livers  Pros--They had several unusual items which made for an adventurous menu. The tartare was an acquired taste but the seasoning was well-executed. Apparently it's illegal in the U.S. The bread was fresh and had a great, crispy crust.   Cons--Cash or Canadian debit only."}
{"text":"Great cocktails. Friendly staff. Amazing food. The bone marrow is beyond divine (sorry vegetarians). House-made charcuterie is also fabulous. Looking forward to winter to hit this place up again!"}
{"text":"I finally understand what all the hype over this place is really about.  This food is goooooooooood :)  We walked in on a Saturday night around 8pm and had no problems getting a table, we were seated immediately. Given the other reviews, this is obviously unusual.  I tried the pork belly with squid and melon. YUMMMMMMMMMMM!!! I didn't get to photo it, it was delicious though. Nice piece of fatty pork belly with grilled calamari bits and cubed watermelon. The sauce was awesome.   We also had the roasted bone marrow and a raw horse sammy. Those were both great too. But pork belly was still my fav.  Oh, and they have a back patio, which I didn't really get to see. Geez. Very cool."}
{"text":"I thought for sure, reading all these reviews that I would be SO disappointed with Black Hoof. It's either people go to expensive places and pretend to like them, or the hype never lives up to the reality. Well, I was wrong.   We ate a lot of the menu and had many a cocktail throughout the night. My favourite cocktails were Corpse Reviver (Cocktail Bar) and Tea & Sympathy (Black Hoof).  Charcuterie: 10/10 there were some meats on there that I wasn't too fond of but the best were things I thought I hated: country terrine and duck bacon type thing. Get a bread basket for this.  Bone Marrow: 10/10 smells funky but tastes so damn delicious, comes with the bread. I sprinkled some sea salt all over the bone first and neither of us found it necessary to eat it with the chimmichurri because it was so good by itself.  Horse Tartare: 10/10 I really wish they still had the horse sammy but this was just perfect. The plate is beautifully presented and the mayo, pickled mushrooms and pea leaves just made the horse meat shine.  Pork Carnitas Tacos: 10/10 (do you see a pattern here?) So delicious and served with pork rinds. There was guac on the bottom, delicious pork and it was topped with such a zingy salsa verde.  Tongue on Brioche: 10/10 SO MUCH TONGUE. I can't believe tongue is considered adventurous here in North America, but I had to get it. So yummy.  We wanted to try the foie and waffles but alas we got way too stuffed. We're definitely coming back here!!!   Service is kind of slow at the Cocktail Bar for the tables. But at Black Hoof, everything is just right. By the way just take a gander at the kitchen...it's flipping tiny HOW DO THEY DO IT? You guys are amazing!  Tiny Suggestion: Text the people on the list, because unfortunately we can't hear you in Cocktail Bar and you can't hear us in Black Hoof."}
{"text":"4.5* Black hoof is a fantastic experience! There isn't much to add to all of the good that has been said about the place already! What I liked immediately about the place was that they essentially have two sister venues within 20 steps that you could hang out at and have a drink/snack until your table is ready. This is an ingenious idea for such a popular place as it removes the annoying clutter of people at the door and also gives the patrons something fun to do!  My favourite dish so far is the oxtail with scallops! It's quite an odd combination but the contrasts in texture and flavor paradoxically compliment each-other perfectly. Also great was the tongue brioche; this dish a great one to share, and one of the few that can be a full meal by itself. The least impressive dish for me was the pork belly, which was cooked perfectly, but in my view was a rather small portion, and the sauce really did not add anything to the dish!  Overall a very very pleasant experience that I am sure will get better with every visit."}
{"text":"The Gist:  Perhaps Toronto's most talked about restaurant over the last five years, the offal-centric The Black Hoof on Dundas is the brain child of Grant van Gameren and Jen Agg.  Celebrated for a daring collection of small plates featuring off cuts ranging from house made charcuterie to raw horse to tongue sandwiches plus unique cocktails in a casual no-reservations atmosphere there had been some talk that the restaurant had fallen off since van Gameren had departed to pursue other ventures, but in the capable hands of Chef Brandon Olsen the restaurant had seemingly again picked up steam as new creations, largely local and seasonal, rounded out the already strong menu.  The Space:  I think the best way to describe The Black Hoof is \"intimate yet unassuming,\" an effect no doubt created by the long and narrow room with dim lighting, heavy woods, and close quartered seating.  With walls largely unadorned save for two chalkboards - one featuring foods and the other cocktails - plus a row of mirrors the diner is faced with two options, to focus on their dining partner or the action in the open kitchen and with an eclectic selection of music ranging from the 50s to the early 80s playing overhead the mood is lively without being \"loud.\"  The Service:  Better than it needs to be, to say the least.  Friendly, efficient, and very knowledgeable regarding everything from ingredient sourcing to plate composition we were never left wanting anything during the 75 minute duration of our meal and with the chalkboard menu not particularly descriptive I was personally very appreciative of the enthusiastic recommendations, even if I'd pretty much made my decisions before our server even filled our water, as well as the timely spacing between each dish.  The Food and Drink:   Tea and Sympathy with Earl Grey Infused Gin, Sherry, Honey, Lemon, Jasmine Bitters:  $8.  My cocktail selection and a rather stiff pour given the modest price.  Generally not a gin drinker but sold on this option as our server described it as \"sweet but not too sweet, and really complex\" the description would prove spot on as the overall flavor was somewhat akin to iced tea with honey and lemon while the boozy notes hit mostly on the tongue while the floral aromatics permeated the palate.  Spicy Horse Tartare:  $16.  Beginning first with the horse itself, lean and smooth with a texture not unlike tuna but a flavor more akin to beef, Chef Olsen took this dish up a notch by adding a significant degree of heat from both black pepper and pimento pepper before leveling it off with rich dollops of hollandaise atop a bed of fried potato threads, onions, greens.  An inspired plate both in terms of taste and texture I instantly understood why this dish has gotten so much attention and would certainly consider it a \"must order\" not only for the novelty, but because it is delicious.  Peking Duck Neck:  $16.  With such a minimalist description on the chalkboard it is hard for me to believe that many diners would opt for this dish but given my predisposition to ordering fowl in any form I didn't even inquire about the preparation before placing my order and much like the horse before it the dish exceeded expectations.  Presented as what appeared to simply be a large sausage served over shredded iceberg lettuce, what actually arrived was locally sourced confit of duck breast, leg, and skin shredded and stuffed inside the duck's neck before a quick pan sear and drizzle of hoisin sauce with the end result a crispy external layer not dissimilar to Peking Duck giving way to an interior of tender meat flecked with more bits of crispy skin.  Intense and savory but well balanced by the sweet hoisin this would prove to be the best duck preparation I've had thus far this year.  Foie and Nutella:  $25.  Featuring a perfectly caramelized slice of liver weighing in at easily 4oz and drizzled with caramel sauce plus hazelnut crumble the dish could have easily stopped here and been quite successful but similar to the other dishes on the menu this plate went above and beyond by placing this texturally complex amalgam atop not only a sizable smear of house made nutella, but also a slice of warm banana pain perdu.  Call it breakfast, call it dessert, call it anything you like - it was so impressive that not only did my friend taste it, she tasted it multiple times and was seen recommending it to patrons on our way out the door.  The Verdict:  Walking out the door with a bill well under $100 after tax and tip my only regret at the time was that we had not ordered more and although I generally target small plates and charcuterie spots for lunches, snacks, or pre-dinner bites I can say without hesitation that The Black Hoof is a special place well worth the price of admission and that it is every bit on par with places like Los Angeles' Animal or Chicago's Publican in terms of creativity, service, and quality."}
{"text":"Overrated Poor service and only 2 of 6 dishes ordered were worthwhile-the pate and the hummus"}
{"text":"Not sure what I can say that others haven't but I adore the Black Hoof. The charcuterie platter is fantastic, enough for a table of four hungry people and the bread is divine. The bone marrow is a small portion, but great for sharing and having a small delectable taste. The calves brain pasta is tasty, not as 'brainy' as I was hoping for but damn delicious anyhow. The drinks are amazing here - do yourself a favour and have a cocktail."}
{"text":"Oh my god, this place was soo cool and unique! They serve tapas that feature some strange part of an animal (generally cow and pig) gourmet-style. And amazing cocktails. What they have that day is up on a board in the restaurant, so no menus. This place is TINY. They have a few tables, but we sat at the bar, which turned out the be the best spot because we had a perfect view of the magic. Never in my life have I witnessed a cooking set-up like this. Four cooks with no room to even squeeze by each other are prepping, garnishing and cooking meats on a home electric stove! And then there's a small dishwasher right next to the stove where a guy is furiously washing the 10 plates this place probably owns. It runs like clockwork, though. My friend and I were amused by the meat slicer's tattoo; a pig feeding itself through a meat grinder. Hardcore.   We ordered a smoked and cured meats platter and it was explained to us the order in which to eat them and which ones were good with the provided dijony mustard. We savored them slowly, commenting to each other about which ones we liked the best and what they tasted like, etc. Then we ordered some strange things like calf brains prepared in a ravioli with artichokes, suckling pig belly in broth, bone marrow and moose liver. The brains and the suckling pig were quite tasty, but I wasn't a big fan of the marrow or the liver. But at least now I can say that I tried them!  Black Hoof is a true culinary experience for foodies everywhere. They are even open on Mondays (and off on Tuesdays) so that restaurant industry workers can go on their day off. And I heard that they raise their own pigs. Amazing."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Yummy.  Adventurous.  Consistent!  Believe the hype.  And all with an electric stovetop!  These guys know to be hip, without trying to be hip and the food is the main attraction.  Don't pass on the cocktails.  Possibly my favourite restaurant in the city."}
{"text":"This is it.  Loved every bite and every sip.  Cannot go wrong at this place and while we were worried there would be limited seating since they do not take reservations - extra seats in the back for the summer so found a cozy nook to sample these savory dishes!"}
{"text":"I was pretty let down from all the hype of this place, especially since Anthony Bourdain even had it featured.  The food was okay, the prices are high, the service is subpar, the wait is long. I guess the hype is purely about the uniqueness of the food?  We had: -  hoof larzo: a cross between cured pork loin and cured back fat - not a huge fan but very unique -  olives: warm/ ive had better -  bread: expensive -  bone marrow: i've had bone marrow before and im not crazy about the pairing with the mustard dressing... -  tongue on brioche: best dish of the night, but nothing spectacular - kinda like montreal smoked meat -  ravioli: really small portion and really cheesy - the tea and sympathy: earl grey infused gin, honey syrup, lemon cream sherry, jasmin bitters - good.  We spent a little over $100 but I wasn't too impressed with the food. I even checked with the server before I ordered that we werent missing anything must haves and he sorta shrugged and said, yeah this is a good selection.  Maybe's it's just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Black Hoof has been tagged in my bookmarks list for about a year. I'm normally very \"go and get it\", but for this particular experience I wanted to be there with someone who'd love it as much as I do. And that means going with someone fearless and fun. Enter the bf.  We went on a Saturday night, around 7pm. Fully expected the place to be completely rammed, with barely any elbow space and a very long wait. Not at all!!! We got a parking spot on the street RIGHT in the front of the restaurant...so practically valet! The server guessed it was due to all the Christmas parties going on that weekend, which made sense.   We ordered the horse tartare, which was gamey and delicate tasting. The pig's blood pappardelle was our favourite!!! The blood taste was just enough so you knew what you were eating, but the texture was just a bit springy and we gobbled that right up. The bone marrow was ok - I mean, I always feel I SHOULD order bone marrow from the menu when it's there, but I'm never wowwed by it. Bone marrow was MP (market price) but that was only $8. Totally legit price. Also ordered the fried sweetbreads. Very aromatic, but fried is fried is fried. Fried stuff always tastes the same. Last thing to come was the pork jowl, which was all fatty goodness. Actually the pork jowl would have been a better dish to have near the beginning, since it was so heavy!   All in all, it was fantastic. Next time, I'm saving room for the cocktails, which are listed on the mirror above the bar."}
{"text":"After two failed meals in Toronto, we had almost given up on finding something good to eat.  We decided to give Toronto one more chance to feed us!  The setting was just like it was from a movie.  Picture two young beautiful women wandering around a rainy downtown city with insatiable hunger!  Totally exasperated, the young beautiful women jump in front of a taxi completely drenched and they plead with the driver to take them anywhere they can get something edible.  The driver takes them on a $20 drive away from the city where they briefly think they are being kidnapped but don't care since they are out of the rain!  They arrive on a dark unassuming street in Little Italy where they get splashed by water from another cab driving by while they wait in the queue to enter The Black Hoof.    There was an hour wait but the lovely people at The Black Hoof told us we could visit Hoof Cocktail Bar just across the street to dry off and unwind with a cocktail or two or possibly even three!  We were pleased with the drinks and service at the bar so we had a really good feeling about the food on the other side of the street.  They did not disappoint!  Here is what we ate:  N'Duja Ravioli This was better than delicious or fantastic, we can't think of the right word for it yet.  Two days of bad food and we FINALLY found something worth eating.  N'duja is a spicy sausage from Calabria, Italy.  Think of it like a hot spicy pate inside fresh pasta that is freaking delicious!  Walnuts, pecorino and a perfectly spiced citrus sauce are the perfect complements to the nduja.     Bone Marrow I am glad Dr. J doesn't care for bone marrow because that meant I didn't have to share with her.  Quite frankly, I didn't want to share with anyone and I didn't!  The chimichurri with a dash of salt is perfect on that toasted bread.   Pork Carnitas Tacos Delish, and yes that is a pork rind!   Andouille & Prawns This is also known to us as shrimp and grits.  The egg yolk made this a tad bit different from what we are used to but the combination wasn't bad.  Our only recommendation is to use actual prawns and not baby shrimp.  What can we say, we love our shrimp.   Buttermilk Brown Sugar Cake This made us forget about all of the bad food we had experienced prior to stepping foot inside The Black Hoof!  Nectarine sorbet, crushed peanuts and condensed milk are the proper accouterments.   We are so happy we found The Black Hoof!  Although they do not take reservations and they only accept cash or Canadian debit, it is worth the wait--Hoof Cocktail Bar is across the street--and every Canadian dollar.  Thank you, thank you, thank you."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: 5-STARS FTW (except for the whole not-accepting-credit-cards remains absolutely rubbish)  There's really nothing else to be said about the Black Hoof that hasn't already been said (and I'm merely writing this review to add to one of my lists). Jen Agg & Co really injected new life into the resto scene in Toronto several years back and has since spread out to new ventures (either personally or via her staff). The fact that the Hoof remains one of the best restos - both in quality and value - after all these years is testament to Jen's ability to hire and manage the right staff.  Their menu receives regular rotation and they're expanded their bevvy menu to include various beers, wines and, of course, cocktails. Needless to say, having the triple threat of the Hoof, the Raw Bar and Cocktail Bar means you'll never really need to wait to eat or drink. Their ROASTED BONE MARROW and HOUSE CURED MEATS remains the gold standard in town, and the SPICY HORSE TARTARE is always a favourite of mine. This is place is a must eat!"}
{"text":"Superb cuts of.....everything, just go! Amazing staff too."}
{"text":"Carnivores welcome! A decadent tapas-gastro-pub dining experience - and not for the faint of heart! The Black Hoof is among the top 10 restaurants you must eat at, no matter if you're a local or tourist. Difficult to find, it is well worth your time, even though it can be pricey and at times, the dishes can be a tad salty. We ordered the bone marrow, the pork tacos, the charcuterie (meat) platter, and the tongue on Brioche. Each dish was beautifully crafted, both in flavour and in aesthetics.   Menu - 5 stars: Reading the list of scrumptious dishes are enough to make you salivate - and wonder \"How on earth did they manage to cook that?\" A perfect rating for not only knowing how to cook tongue, horse, or seal, but how to make it taste divine.  Food - 4 stars: All dishes were flavourful and fresh. Minus one star for small portions and for rock-hard bread. Other than that, it was perfectly delicious. The pork tacos were nice, the charcuterie platter was ample, and the tongue was well-presented.  Drink - N/A  Hours - 4 stars: Note the weird hours. Thursday to Saturday from 6:00 pm - 1:00 am, Sunday and Monday 6:00 pm - 11:30 pm, and closed Tuesday and Wednesday. Well, you can't eat meat 7 days a week, so go elsewhere on Tuesdays and Wednesdays!  Location - 4 stars: Close enough to downtown (Dundas and Spadina). Simply take the Dundas streetcar westward for about 15-20 minutes. For newbies, you'll need to keep an eye out for the venue. It's on the north side of the street, look for the pig logo.  Wait Time - 5 stars: I hear this is dependent on when you come. We came promptly at 6:30 pm and there was no wait. The back patio was already almost full, so come early if you don't want to wait long for that savoury bone marrow. Yum.  Service - 5 stars: Speedy, smiling, and hipsterish. The service was exemplary and the wait for food was timely. Keep in mind that most of the magic happens in the kitchen and many of these dishes requires hours of prep, so appreciate that mouthful of wow.  Venue/Vibe - 5 star: The back patio was chic and homely, hipster but not pretentious. Built from planks of wood, the patio deck is nicely space - not too cramped, not too airy. There's seating inside too that is cozy and warm, fresh and modern.  Cleanliness - 4 star: The kitchen and dining area is spick and span, no gripes. Bravo for not having the place smell like a huge meat factory with all that cooking!  Washrooms - 4 star: Great, but not perfect. Would have expected higher standards for a place this popular. Go here if you need to, but don't expect a Ritz Carlton type of toilet. Could be stocked with better tissues and cleaned more often. Meh.  House Rules - N/A  Cost - 3 stars: It's a bit steep for each dish, but I can see how much prep and time goes into crafting each meal. The portions can be minuscule too, so the overall price on its own deserves a 3. Prepare to spend at least $70 for 2, not including drinks.  X factor - 5 star: Perhaps the only place in Toronto to serve unique cuts of meat. Horse, seal, quail, goat, beef heart, liver, and more. Not only that, you have the master chefs working to whip these otherwise disgusting body parts into a delicious dish.  The Black Hoof is above all else, a dining experience. Don't expect to be full at the end of your meal, but rather relish in a chance to try a dish you've never experience before. I've been to Chicago and have been to the Purple Pig, which is similar to Black Hoof in terms of quality of food, which suggests to me that The Black Hoof's food standards rivals that of Chicago's. The Black Hoof is for the meat-lovers out there, looking to try something new. Also a favourite spot for Anthony Bourdain when he's in Toronto, it's a culinary delight full of unusual but tasty game meat."}
{"text":"I thought i was going to get blown away by the market price bone marrow dish, i mean it was nice and had a unique flavour to it but not something someone would crave. the cured meat dish was cured meat dish i guess.  the pork taco dish stole the show. hands down my favorite dish here. 5 stars. the ingredients meshed well together not too much of anyone one thing. A melt in your mouth taco not a whole lot of chewing involved.   Good friendly service. willl need to come back and try the many sharing dishes they offer. if you've never been here its a bit elusive because there isnt much other businesses near it.   Inside: it's small, dark and date friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Last night I died and went to \"WTF are you eating heaven\"! Seriously Fear factor has nothing on Black Hoof's exotic menu, and despite being scared shitless I had complete faith in my fellow Yelpers... man am I ever glad I did!  Lets start with the arrival. After reading horror stories of hour long waits for this place, hubby and I decided to be at BH right as they opened for dinner. This proved to be a smart idea as we were immediately seated. Our waitress was great: friendly knowledgeable and generally a pleasure.  I guess you could say the decor is \"minimalistic barn chic\". Lots of untreated wood and unpolished sheet-metal help give the place a very no frills and almost masculine appearance... we are after all about to eat \"Noah's Ark\" worth of meat!  The menu had no veggies in sight, which is good news for me, bad news for my arteries! We started with a small charcuterie and the roasted bone marrow, both were amazing! I hate liver, even in fancy spread formats and yet here I was devouring their incredible Duck Liver Mousse Pate.  The roasted bone marrow freaked me out a bit at first but one bite of my bread with this jelly wonder (and a  bit of salt) and I wondered is all marrow was this good!  Last but not least, hubby and I ordered the raw horse meat sandwich with hot sauce. This was by far my favourite part of the meal! The horse meat was tender and the flavour was beautifully intense.  As everyone has already mentioned, they only take cash and debit here and most starters and main dishes run between $15-$25. Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to visit while in Toronto for a work conference.  It was a ways off from downtown, but WELL worth the trek.    If you love meat, you're at the right spot.  They serve a bit of EVERYTHING from each delicious beast.  Our dinner consisted of the following:  Foie Gras - One of the primary items we came for, since foie gras is no longer sold in California.  Savory and just a touch sweet.  DELICIOUS!    Bone Marrow - Rich and savory - Seasonings on to side.  Horse Tartar - If you're from the States, a must have.  Similar to beef tartar, but slightly leaner.  Crispy Pig Ears - Served nacho style with all the fixings!  YUM.  Beef Tongue - Brined to salty goodness served on Brioche.  Think corned-beef.  Every thing was AMAZING.  Well worth the trip where ever you are.  Things to be aware of:  Cash or Canadia Debit Card only."}
{"text":"why are all good places so hidden?! With nothing else open on that block, its difficult to find with the lack of lighting or sign. My curiosity for horse meat brought me here, well of course the 10000 positive reviews helped as well.   Seems like everyone loves the bone marrow. Lets give it a try. For 20$ per order, you only get maybe one spoonful of fat. It was good, but not $20 a bite good.   horse meat tartare: Looking at it reminds me of the same one you get similar to the beef tartare in Nome Izakaya.  Rare meat with seasoning and a raw egg sitting right on top. Except the one from Nome was one third of the price. OK fine. It's the horse meat that really makes the difference. The meat was tasted very similar to beef, a little lighter, and just a tad slimier.  Beef tongue: I am a huge fan of beef tongue. I love the texture of it The tongue they serve was between a bed of bread, some spicy mustard on top. Smoked meat sandwich style.   I'm a fan of variety. I get bored of the taste once I have it for more than 5 bites. This place is good if you're not too hungry but you want something to pick on. To be honest the prices here are a little high for the portions. I mean, you get the same idea as izakayas except its 2-3 times the price. If it costed half as much then my expectations would be lowered = higher rating. It was a good one-time experience, if you've never been then you have try. But, I wouldn't be a regular."}
{"text":"Black Hoof is a pleasant surprise for me!   I never would have believe that I would have enjoy eating a Horse Tartar sandwich, Bone Marrow, Foie Gras Mousse(it looks like peanut butter! and of course taste much better!)  The service here is excellent!! Even on a Saturday night in a busy restaurant, my glass of water always refilled without asking! The waitstaffs are all really knowledgable and really patient and helpful.  The most important of all is the yelpers that I dine with makes the experience so much enjoyable! THANK YOU! Black Hoof is a great place to go and share great dining experience with old and new friends.  BTW, I came and secured a table for us at 6 pm right when the restaurant open, as I did not need to wait for one. I don't know if I would be that happy if I have to wait for over 1 hour in order to eat there!"}
{"text":"I don't really have anything new to add; this update is more of a reiteration (or a renewal of vows). I have continued to frequent the Hoof countless times over the past few years and it is always on-point. While the food is fun, it's the knowledgeable and friendly (but not overbearing) service that stands out. Too few places in Toronto realize that service matters. And few of them have the food to match the Hoof's, so their aloofness is unwarranted.  This is easily my favorite restaurant in Toronto, if not the world."}
{"text":"Brillant, I tried the place a few time this winter. Once for tapas dinner which rocked..deep fried navy beans..yum, duck salami, apple sausages..oh and a few other delights..a bottle a delicous Merlot..  Then brunch..delightful..peanutbutter french toast with - frois grois..Heaven..just..grrrr.."}
{"text":"This was a lovely bar with a wonderful atmosphere. Looks gorgeous and has a really intimate, well-designed feel. We sat at the bar, as a party of four, and enjoyed our time very much. Both the bartender and the waitress were friendly, polite and made us feel very welcome.    All of the drinks were fantastic and made with extreme care and attention; now that BarChef is massively overcrowded, this is the place to go for handcrafted cocktails with high-end elements. Cocktails were $13 or so, and worth the price. Also, they served some of the drinks in 1920s-style coupette glasses, which was a nice touch. I had a Lavender Hound and then an End Game, which was the drink special of the night."}
{"text":"I came for the bone marrow, but would return for the horse tartar.  Sexy intimate meatbased food and sassy cocktails with a splendid brewlist featuring local beers and bottles of standard/interesting. The atmosphere was warm and funky, the staff were knowledgeable and kind, but the music was a little too loud so it was occasionally difficult to hear (or maybe I am just getting old).  The horse tartar was something to write home about: a melody of textures and tastes that were absolutely sublime. Thanks for a great experience!  Ps. I really really wanted to shoot bourbon out of bone marrow like Anthony Bourdain, but refrained because I didn't want to be That Person."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Black Hoof for some time. The experience was less and more than expected. Saturday night and the wait was less than a half hour for a table for two. We went to their cocktail bar across the street for drinks and oysters. I loved my \"Bourbon and Coke\" which was a heady mix that tasted more like bourbon and Brio.  The restaurant had a table quicker than expected but we were able to wait at the cocktail bar to finish our drinks.  The menu is a tasters feast of fairly off centre meat based dishes. We shared the sweetbreads, which were sautéed with artichoke in brown butter and had a smokey  flavor and a firm texture. Amazing! The tongue on brioche was so tender and perfectly pickled. The marrow was tasty spread on toast, but they charged $2 for the bread without telling us it wasn't included. We didn't end up eating much more than that, save for an olive plate. Both of us loved the food.  The atmosphere is friendly and unpretentious. The wait staff were quite nice and gave good recommendations. We chatted with our neighboring tables and even shared some of our dishes (tasted the horse carpaccio, which tasted wild and rich). We were also recommended the ravioli by other neighbors, which we didn't order. All in all a highly enjoyable evening out, start to finish. I would not hesitate to return or recommend."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious. You have to be a bit of an adventurous eater, but in my opinion this is part of the allure of this acclaimed establishment. If Anthony Bourdain, choose to venture there, you know it must be \"the real deal.\""}
{"text":"Pretentious, yet so unpretentious...pure luck I find myself here, and with a little bad luck too...RIP Anthony Bourdain...and so long Black Hoof as I hear you're done in August...but I get it, perfection can only last so long. This girl loves everything foie gras and served as a Torchon and then as part of a lemon meringue concoction (yes, mofo lemon meringue) it's only fitting I re-grace Yelp and reinvigorate all that's great about this place."}
{"text":"Good every time. Their charcuterie board and cheese plates are to die for. Tried the bone marrow but wasn't anything crazy after what I had expected. Good spot for date night. Service is fantastic and excellent wine selection."}
{"text":"Two incredible reasons Black Hoof gets 5 stars: * Items on the menu I've seen no where else * Awesome service from the woman who sets the beer menu  Black Hoof exceeded my expectations.  I'd read about it on Yelp from my home in Los Angeles and it was my first destination after landing in YYZ.  Even with such high expectations Black Hoof exceeded them.  Why I am I raving about the menu?  It has items like a Raw Horse Sammy, Beets and Lamb Tongue, Crispy Pig Ear salad there's bound to be something on the chalk board menu that you haven't had before.  I had to officiate a wedding the next day so was more conservative than I might have been otherwise so I had a charcuterie plate (that did include horse mortadella) and a spreadable salumi on taglietelle.    When Erin and I let the server know that we're into beer and were interested in trying some beers from Toronto or Ontario, the server's face lit up and she shared that she creates the beer list.  Erin wanted a porter and she recommended Wellington Porter.  I asked for one of her favorites and she recommended an IPA from Mike Duggan.  She then ran across the street to Black Hoof's sister restaurant to get these bottles (more beers are stored over there because they have a larger fridge).  We were quite impressed and pleased with our beer selection.  Finally the vibe of the place is my kind of place.  Big Kudo's for the server's recommendation that we out-of-towners stroll down Ossington after dinner (at 12 am) to find something to do.  We were impressed with how many people were out and about, moreover with the number of people riding bikes that time of night.  I saw more people riding bikes in 5 minutes at midnight than I've seen in one year in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Service: The service is good, and the staff are very knowledgeable of the menu. They'll suggest dishes that'll fit your palette.    Ambiance: The restaurant is a small, and it's mostly candlelight lighting. It's great for a small group of friends or for a date.  Food: The food here is where you really have to have an open mind. The concept is based on using different animal parts/organs to make dishes that totally disguises them. The menu also changes based on what kind of parts they can secure. I tried a good variety of the menu, and some dishes are really well done that you can't even tell it's an organ dish. On the other hand, some dishes weren't as good as I thought it would be, the price is also on the more $$$ side."}
{"text":"What a great place. Attentive service, yummy cocktails, a menu limited to only the most excellent options, delicious meats with subtle flavours in a fun atmosphere (get ready to chat with the people who are sitting next to you - well, practically on top of you).  My friend and I showed up quite late on a Monday night, thinking we might be able to avoid the crowds. Ha! The place was rammed. A super-friendly hostess quoted a 30-45 minute wait, took my name and number and promised to call when a table became available, and recommended the Press Club up the street for drinks.  I was doubtful about hearing back given that my name was written quite far down the list and they were set to close in about an hour and a half, but I received a call within half an hour.   For some reason, I was kind of determined to hate Black Hoof, but the place and the food charmed me out of it. A recommendation to pair their octopus dish with Barbera wine - a drawing of an octopus joyfully brandishing a wine glass with the caption \"octopus + Barbera = true love\" - was drawn in chalk on the wall facing me, and melted my heart before I'd even downed a cocktail. The cocktail was a Savage Dandy and was delicious. Highly recommended if you like bourbon cocktails. My friend opted for a gin-based cocktail and had a Basil Fawlty and it was also excellent - very refreshing.  Our waiter ran through the menu and described the dining as \"tapas style\", which we eventually discovered referred to the sharing aspect and not to the size of the dishes. Bear in mind - the portions here are either big, filling, or both! The next time I go, I'll order more dishes if I'm still hungry, rather than ordering all at once.  I hear tell that standard practice is to order two dishes, but that didn't seem to offer enough variety so we opted for four. This was too much, so I think that \"ordering up\" is the ideal solution here. The only useful strategy in our case was to befriend the people next to you and trade off bits of dishes! We ended up giving much of one, and a little of another, of our dishes to the friendly couple sitting next to us. They traded us some of their cheese platter. Good times.  On to what we ordered:   - much-recommended charcuterie platter: delicious meats with subtle flavours, and recommended again here. The duck was the winner, although it was hard to choose.  - foie gras mousse: the waiter warned us that this was rich and he was right! I was surprised by the size - it was as big as a large coaster, and about two inches thick. It was also the only disappointment of the evening. The foie gras tasted SO strongly of butter all the way through that the taste of the meat was indiscernible. We might as well have ordered a slab of salty butter. Too bad. I also suspect that this was the thing that filled us up! So if you want to taste more, I'd steer clear of this foie gras (there is another on the menu that is apparently less rich, though, in case you need your fix).  - tongue on brioche: my friend was reticent to try this one because of the stigma around tongue but I refused to let it pass us by. It was almost unbearably delicious. The tongue was soft (as tongue tends to be), but with none of the harsh, weird undertones often ascribed to the meat. This tasted more like silky smoked meat, and went wonderfully with the brioche. It was also huge! My only regret was that we'd filled up on the foie gras and couldn't enjoy this as much as we should've.  - glazed pork belly: four inch-thick medallions, perfectly cooked and succulent, served on top of a tangy (but not overpowering) barbecue sauce and some sauteed onions. Was basically in a meat coma by this point but managed to eat two pieces, my friend had one, and the last went to the couple next to us.  Given the quality of the food and size of the portions, plus cocktails, the bill was surprisingly affordable - around $90 or so. We stumbled out, sinuses packed with meat. I'd return in a heartbeat as I'd love to try some other offerings on their oft-changing menu, but next time I'll stagger my order!"}
{"text":"This was a super fun dining experience. Everyone there was friendly and helpful. The service was truly excellent and the restaurant is small but fun and inviting. If it weren't for the slightly high prices I would have easily given five stars. I think we got out of there for $160. That included the cheese plate, bone marrow, charcuterie, scallops, horse tartare, Brussel sprouts, and two glasses of wine. The cheese plate had 3 cheeses and a variety of sauces. It was so so so yummy. My favorite thing. The charcuterie was also very good. And the bone marrow, although small, was also delicious. That was only $8 though so I can't complain. The scallops were good. I liked them but they were a bit fishy for my husband. And it was probably only a total of about 1 scallop so that seemed a bit overpriced. The horse tartare was good, but I'm not sure I would order it again. The tacos, although we didn't get them, looked really good as the serve brought them out to another table. And the Brussel sprouts were interesting. Overall, a very fun and new dining experience. I really like how they take unusual ingredients using all parts of the animal and make it into dishes that you can take seriously and are not on the menu for shock value. Well done."}
{"text":"I ate here in 2010.  I love the decor.  This is a totally hip and cozie, foodie joint.    The food here is simply amazing!!!   I wish they had a place exactly like this in SF.  There are lots of awesome restaurants in SF, but none quite like this one.  I had the calf brain pasta, the foie gras sandwich on brioche bun, and a beef tounge sandwich, and a very good cocktail made with bitters, ctirus, and egg white.  I cannot totally remember everything because it has been well over a year, but it was all super tasty.   Sometimes, people use offal for the sake of using offal.  I am learning that the hard way.   This place really takes offal to a whole new level.  The calf brains pasta was made by someone who REALLY knows how to make pasta.  The texture of the house made noodles was perfect, the sauce was light, bright, and a balanced, and the calfs brain was subtle but delicious.  It is sort of a more clean and complex version of tripe.  The dish could have used a little more richness in the sauce to make up for the like of punch of the protein, but I like that is was left subtle.   The foie gras was amazing.  It was not a terrine, torchon, or pate, or a whole liver form.  It was somewhat between liver form and torchon, and seared like crazy.  I have never had it seared like this.  It was amazing!!!! Wow.  Add in the ridiculous real Canadian maple syrup to add some sweetness to that seared, fatty, salted goodness, and you get fireworks!!!  The beef tongue was the least memorable, but still awesome.  The protein consisted of thick cut ,long braised peices beef tounge. It almost tasted like they \"corned\" it.  It had a nice sauce, and the brioche bun seemed freshly made, buttery, and well toasted.  Man, I could eat these sandwiches once a week.  It wasn't as mind blowing as the other stuff, but something I would love eating often.  From the vibe, to the decor, to the cocktails, to the great preparations of offal, this is probably one of my favorite restaurants in 2010."}
{"text":"The vibe didn't hit it off with me. But I was soon blown away as I found myself waiting and salvating for the new sensations that was our order. Funny what food can do to you. Turn you back into animals.  My top three were.. oxtail with scallops Bone marrow Foie with nutella (note I recommend not to eat the splash of nutella on the side, it really overwhelms the pleasant extroidinary taste of this dessert-like dish)  Sensibly I would order the cured meat judging from the type of restaurant, which I did but it did not make it to my list. Although it was still good and I liked the mustard they have. Other note is they have a white kitchen stove, I totally did not notice until someone pointed it out. It's something out of the ordinary you might even miss, because it seems maybe out of place."}
{"text":"My family and I came to Toronto from Michigan simply to eat good food, and the Black Hoof was the best food experience I have had in a long, long time.   We walked up to the Black Hoof on a Friday night in the summer at about 7:00pm - and immediately sat down. Not even close to a wait. Room temperature water is served immediately in a dimly lit, stylish, and loud (good music playing overhead) atmosphere.   Service was very attentive, proper, and refilled our water the second I wanted more. Don't bother with drinks if you're on any sort of budget. Not cheap.  No reservations. Speaking of that, Anthony Bourdain has been here.  On to what matters:  1. Bone Marrow is a must; heated in the oven and served warm, extremely savory, a little salty, and gooey, jelly-like deliciousness. $8.  2. Beef Tongue Brioche, served with an incredible tarragon mayo, delicious pickled celery, and melt in your mouth brioche with half-chewy, half-tender tongue (which, to me, was amazing). $14.  3. Horse Tartare, served with a perfect spicy green sauce, the best chips I've ever had in my life (made from Jerusalem artichokes), and an egg right on top of the perfectly-seasoned, tender, non-gamey raw horse patty, served cold. Simply amazing. Don't let it scare you. $18.  4. The best for last - legitimately the best dessert I've ever had in my life - a scoop of maple ice cream on top of a buttery pretzel \"tart\" cup, with rich, melted carmel waiting to ooze out from the bottle of the flaky, buttery cup, and an accompanying stout jam (stout as in, yes, beer) with brown sugar sprinkled over everything. Seriously, the best dessert I've ever had. You can only hope that they happen to have this dessert when you visit, which, you absolutely should. $10.   We also got the seasonal sorbet, which was rhubarb; it was good but nothing remarkable, and which certainly got overshadowed by the maple ice cream. $6.  Go to the Black Hoof for high-quality food. Go for culinary creations that you won't forget, and for truly delicious, unique, and creative edible masterpieces."}
{"text":"The Black Hoof has been on radar for ages! So I was absolutely thrilled when my friend chose this restaurant for her birthday dinner! The restaurant was quite small, so we arrived promptly at 6 to avoid waiting for a seat. Now onto the food!  One friend was very squeamish about all the nose-to-tail options available at the restaurant, so she asked for a recommendation for the safest option on the menu, which turned out to be potato & roe ($12). It was actually quite an ordinary potato soup, save for the addition of large salmon roes. I didn't actually think that the salmon roes added that much to the soup, but on the whole, it was tasty.  The rest of us were more adventurous and ordered a bunch of dishes to share. The Black Hoof is most well-known for their charcuterie, so naturally, we had to order a platter of house cured meats ($29) to share. I honestly couldn't remember all the names of the meat, but I know that there was duck prosciutto and walnut studded salami. We also had a large order of bread ($4) to go with the charcuterie. I thought that the charcuterie was good, but everything tasted pretty similar and nothing really stood out.  I've never tried horse meat before, so I was pretty excited for The Black Hoof's spicy horse tartare ($16). To my delight, it was quite delicious! To be perfectly honest, the horse meat just tasted like beef, but the texture was a good contrast against the crispy fried potato sticks. Everything together was quite rich (especially with that creamy sauce), so I recommend sharing this with a larger group.  I also quite enjoyed smoked sweetbreads ($16). Eating an animal's thymus gland might sound disgusting, but it certainly tasted great! They reminded me of delicious and juicy chicken nuggets!  I was extremely eager for tongue on brioche ($14) because I absolutely loved The Hoof Cafe's tongue grilled cheese. Sadly, this was not as good as the sandwich in my memory.   We also wanted to try bone marrow here, but our server missed our order. No matter, as we were already sufficiently satisfied and everything was exceedingly rich.  All in all, I enjoyed the food at The Black Hoof, but it didn't exactly live up to my expectations (which were set by The Hoof Cafe)."}
{"text":"We were very much looking forward to trying what seems to be a city-wide favourite in Black Hoof. The menu is very unique, there is a nice selection of drinks, and the service was great.  We ordered the cheese platter, the bone marrow, and the horse tartare. The cheese platter was good, but you have to order bread separately to accompany. The bone marrow was interesting and seems to be a must when dining at the Black Hoof. I wasn't blown away by it. Finally, the horse tartare- mixed reviews.  If you're looking for something unique and if your taste buds have a sense of adventure, in my opinion it's worth a try."}
{"text":"This is the type of place I'm always looking for. Small and unpretentious, but a cool space with a great, simple menu."}
{"text":"2009 is winding down so we may very well be in the beginning stages of some new food trend already, but charcuterie is still making a big impression as it finds its way from town to town.  And why not?  It lends itself to using local goods and has a kind of fast-food version of slow-food thing going on.  You don't need an expert chef working the stove, just some good knife skills and a love for flavor combinations and a space to get some curing and smoking done.  I think there were maybe two pots in use while I had dinner at The Black Hoof, but the meal was worth twice as much as it ended up costing.  It's highly recommended that you begin with a cheese and charcuterie plate or two and while the horse sandwich was tempting I went with the tongue and have no regrets -- it was rather amazing. My date went with the scallops for the main course and I certainly understood the logic behind that -- it didn't fail to impress and despite what some might say, too much meat can be bad thing (in that you may feel unsure of whether you'll be able to make it out the door without assistance).  The wine selection was great -- found a new Canadian favorite in Fielding.  The cocktails on the other hand, could use a little restraint in the amount of herbage that goes into them.  Aside from that though, one of the best, most memorable meals I've had in some time."}
{"text":"Black Hoof brought this stretch of Dundas to life with carnivorous delights a few years back. If you're an adventurous meat eater (horse tartar, bone marrow, sweetbreads), this place is for you... and Anthony Bourdain.   If you're like me, and will dive into the delicious, but pass on adventurous meats, great news! This place is still for you! If pork parfait doesn't thrill you, the cheese, charcuterie, pickles, olives and drink lists are always delicious and always there for you.   Dining at this reso-free meat mecca once caused hour plus waits in the street, or something stirred from Cocktail Bar across the way. Luckily, the extreme popularity has calmed down lately. On a Thursday at 7pm you can pop in for some appetizers and drinks without much of a wait at this dark, casual culinary institution. Bon Appetit."}
{"text":"Black Hoof is what the 5th star was invented for on Yelp. This place is in my books the best that Toronto has to offer in the way of restaurants. Great atmosphere in a small cozy setting, whether you're sitting with a group of friends at the back or enjoying the company of the amazing staff up front at the bar, Black Hoof is just perfection. I am slowly but surely working my way through the menu but its very hard as I find myself falling in love with everything I try and needing to revisit some of the old meals when those cravings kick in. I can say that no matter what you try you won't be disappointed but so far the tried, tested and true have got to be the bone marrow, the Tongue on Brioche and the Smoked sweetbreads. These three plates are can't miss and just writing about them is making me want to swing down for a quick bite.   Now as Jen C mentioned, unless you get there really early or fairly late you will find yourself waiting a while for a table but no matter how long the wait you'll be happy you did.  Oh and by the way, if you're vegetarian this place ain't gonna be your # 1 that T.O has to offer. Sorry for that and good luck finding it, to all others Black Hoof is a must!!!"}
{"text":"If you love meat, you will LOVE The Black Hoof!! My friends and I tried many items on the menu and cannot recall a single one I didnt love!! So let's hone in on my faves!!!  - Horse Tartare: delightfully tasty!! - Pork carnitas tacos: savory!! - Bone marrow: duh!! (but didnt try it with bourbon... shame!!) - Tongue on brioche: siiick!!! - FOIE GRAS on strawberry dessert: a MASTERPIECE!!  Advice: - Pace yourself. The dishes seem small in size, but they got some heavy content Hence, eat slowly. Savor each bite. Coz the next thing you know, your meal is over!!   Toronto's #1 rated restaurants... done and done!! LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"Two stars if I wanted to be Robin Hood, but three stars would be a true rating for this restaurant. Look, I think it's great that Canadians and people in general are becoming more and more accepting of offal. At the end of the day, some of the most delicious and flavorful morsels of an animal are ...well, the organs and the \"variety bits.\" But I think it's important to recognize that it's ok to add flavor and to \"polish up\" offal. I've noticed that many Americans, as well as Canadians apparently love to deconstruct and present meats as is, without adding anything to it and just serving it up raw because clearly that's the best way to get the natural \"essence\" of a meat. That's part of the reason why some people have come to like rare steaks and runny eggs. It's cool if you like it, but I think it's also good to dress it up. If you gave rare steak or runny eggs to Asian people in Asia they'd just say \"....but why wouldn't you cook it? You have a fire. And a stove.\" A little bit of cooking when it comes to offal can go a long way.   For example, Asian people dress up offal all the time. In my childhood hometown, one of the most popular dishes to eat during the winter time was lamb offal. By god, to this day that is the one thing I crave most in the winter time. Lamb as a meat warms you up and it's just so so so incredibly perfect to eat during the winter time. That soup does rely principally on lamb offal, but it's also filled with various spices and herbs, along with a dash of vinegar to cut into the supposed gamey-ness of the meat. And that's fine. There's nothing wrong with adding ingredients and labor to a piece of meat. Far from tainting it, I think it imbues it with a unique flavor that oftentimes is better than simply eating so...horse meat raw via tartare form, or eating heart that's been slightly roasted. The two super \"offal\" dishes I had just made me think: ...why? The horse tartare was just incredibly chewy, and horse meat itself is obviously NOT naturally tender, simply because it's a freaking horse. Guess which animal uses more of its muscles, a horse, or a cow? This one was just bad, and I could barely finish it because of how chewy the meat was. Then we've got the heart. My god, this was equally bad. It just made me dread every single bite because it was so dressed down, and I would like to think of myself as an adventurous eater. Now the tongue entree was great. The soft bread and the mustard seeds reminded me of a simple but mouthwatering corned beef/pastrami sandwich (which was the obvious intention) and this one far surpassed my expectations. Finally, the bone marrow was good...but the rock salt sprinkled on overpowered the natural flavors of the marrow. So that's 1.5 out of 4 dishes that are good. ...Thus, the 3 stars. Service was certainly good enough, I just didn't find anything redeeming in the entrees ordered...and really hope they do a little more tinkering to figure out what works best."}
{"text":"OMAHGAWD - If you like meat GO TO THIS PLACE. NOW. DON\"T DELAY.  Infact, why am I not there right now??!  DELICIOUS. MEAT. and GREAT service.  Food: Large charcuterie board. Delicious. all of it. Especially the Lardo Proscuitto and Frois Gras. Tongue.  Delicious. So good. Raw Horse Meat. Good, but by that time I had too much food. Cheese board. Delicious. Do it!  Added two bottles of wine on top of that, only came to $200.  This place is so damn affordable for the best prepared meats.  GO."}
{"text":"So many interesting meats! I had the bone marrow and it was very very good. It's a real fun place to go to with a couple of other carnivores...  Lots of tasty if somewhat adventurous options."}
{"text":"Legitimately awesome. Sure, I may be over-hyping a little, but our time here was excellent, and it truly was a unique dining experience.  We came here just as it opened, so as to avoid crowds. As we arrived, there was already a line outside forming, even in the unholy 16-degree windy weather. I know Canadians might be used to it, but that is dedication. Despite the existence of this line, we were seated promptly, near the back. The space is small, with a number of seats at the bar, giving the place a cozy, casual vibe. There seems to be an outdoor space in the back, so there might be more capacity during warmer weather. Yet, even at the end of our meal around 715pm, there were still a few 2-seater tables open, which I found surprising, especially for a Saturday. Nonetheless, I probably would recommend coming earlier if you have a larger party.   Anyways, as we sat down, I was pretty excited to try as much as possible, as this was easily the most-anticipated meal of our trip. The food menu was all on the chalkboards, as well as the cocktail and drink menu. There aren't any descriptions with any of the titles, so make sure to ask your server about allergies and ingredients used. For drinks, I went for the Tea & Sympathy (earl grey infused gin, honey syrup, lemon, cream sherry, jasmine bitters), as I was looking for something a little more subtle, and I didn't want the drink to overpower these assorted meat products. I also liked that it wasn't too sweet, and still provided a good kick of booze. We opted not to try Cocktail Bar (owned by the same people as Black Hoof) across the street, but given how good the cocktails were, I'd be more than inclined to try it the next time I'm in town.  Onto our (large) food order: - Bone Marrow with chimichurri: Excellent, and just so rich with the bread. At $8 for 2 large bones (price subject to availability), it's quite a good deal. Beware, because you may be dripping with fat by the end of it all. During his trip to Toronto on the Layover, Anthony Bourdain does a bone luge after finishing his bone marrow, which is basically pouring liquor down the emptied crevice of the bone, to pick up any remaining fat and flavor. We opted not to do this, as it was still early, and we still had a lot of other dishes coming up. - Horse Tartare with brioche: Our first time eating horse, the texture was definitely different from most raw meats, but still very delicious with all of the herbs, and on top of the soft, pillowy bread, a good, nay, great combination. - Pork tongue and blood terrine: So flavorful, and perfect with the pickled, cubed vegetables. The sight of the congealed and mixed blood might be a little harrowing for some, but we ate this right up, and didn't look back. - Smoked pork jowl with figs: Definitely on the fattier side of products within the porcine spectrum. I highly recommend eating it with the figs concurrently, so as to offset the sheer fattiness of the jowl. - Charred Rapini with walnuts and roasted figs: We had to get some sort of vegetable, so as to make ourselves feel better about all the meat we were eating. Yet, this was an excellent dish, as the rapini was perfectly cooked and paired well with the roasted figs. - Foie gras and French toast: As a dessert, this was incredibly strange, but incredibly delicious. You might be reluctant to try the mix of savory and sweet, but it was a really good mix of flavors. The two large hunks of foie gras were very sizable, and if you take a bite with all of the components at once, the dish surprisingly comes together quite well.  Our server was excellent, gave us some really good recommendations, and didn't even blink when I told her the two of us were getting 6 dishes. The only thing that was a little inconvenient was the acceptance of only cash and Canadian debit cards for payment. Only holding American debit and credit cards, we also didn't quite have enough cash on hand to pay for our crazily large order of dishes and drinks, so we went to the 7-11 nearby to withdraw more cash. Our server was very patient, so it wasn't a problem. With that, the prices are pretty reasonable in my opinion for small plates, especially with all of these unique ingredients and perfectly-executed dishes.  Definitely not for vegetarians/vegans, or those who might get queasy with eating uncommon animal parts. With that said, for carnivores and adventurous omnivores, it's easily a must-try restaurant when in Toronto. Even if you had the likes of pork tongue, bone marrow and horse before, there's just something to be said when the menu is also perfectly executed, from beginning to end. This was priority number one during this trip to Toronto, and it will easily be priority number one on my next trip to Toronto as well."}
{"text":"Despite the great ratings this place has, i still have my own opinions about it. Don't get me wrong, the food tasted great and is very special on its own. But if you are planning to get full here then please eat before/after you come/leave. As a student with student loans, it was not worth it to order more menu items just to get full. The meat platter tasted great. However, they were cut so thin i felt like i was eating air.   The sweatbreads tasted amazing though. Very good flavour and i would get it again if i went back."}
{"text":"I'd literally been eyeing Black Hoof for a few years any time the mention of a 'Special Occasion Meal' came up (birthday, promotion, anniversary, etc), but it always took a back seat because we'd heard of the long waits and lack of reservations.  I'm a fairly adventurous eater, and the tapas style menu featuring 'weird' meats is totally my style.  We FINALLY went for my going away meal, and it was everything I'd ever hoped for and more. We ordered the bone marrow, lamb tartare, pig's ear slaw, and tongue on brioche and loved every single bite.  Easily one of the best meals I had in my four years in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to come here with all the rave reviews from Yelp but it's a tad too west for me.  But I finally came one night (Friday night) and it was amaaazzzing!!! And EXPENSIVE! Man the prices are crazy...  We ordered the Pork Canitas Tacos $11 and Tongue On Brioche $14 to share. The tacos were about the size of my palm, about two bites to finish. The tongues were real yummy, I believe there were two pieces of brioche.  The food was GREAT! It really was. I also love the dim lighting and the decor of the place, but it was pretty loud. We ordered the Sangria to share as well.   I most likely won't return until I earn a little more.   Cash and debit only!"}
{"text":"The only reason that im not gonna give  a 5 star rating is because of the price point at this gorgeous charcuterie, the food is amazing very well done, but i find it a bit pricy, i went there for dinner with my girl, and i spent 95 dollars but we where still hungry, so that was the only disappointing part."}
{"text":"Everyday dish has a Wow factor. It's not your inauthentic \"instagramble\" food, this is the real culinary art talking.   Charcuteries plate was delicious, all the meat has a tasty flavour. Bone marrow, perhaps the most generous one I've ever had. horse tartare, yes horse, it was soooo goood! The flavour, the balance in crunchy and soft texture, sauce and purée!  Wow ~ sweat bread sausage, coconut cream kinda purée with lavender scent and some crunch oat? It definitely is the most wild combination!! Potato and meat, aka beef heart, wow! Snail pasta, wow....  Have to come back again when they switch the menu.      Why not 4 star? The menu can be a bit more comprehensive. Place charge for Bread and butter...really?! No matter how good your bread is, it's like going to macdonald ask for ketchup for 50 cent extra. Just felt a little uncaring. Location is not the best."}
{"text":"A few people told me about this place, so when I went to visit a friend I suggested we try it out!  They were not busy at all when we went.  No waiting and the serve was fast!  Sit outside in the back if you can it's really nice and homey.   The menu is definitely creative and although I do not eat a lot of meat or meat products I still enjoyed it.  We ordered a few different things:  Bone marrow (it's a must because, well, it just is) Foie & pork liver parfait  Spicy scallop crudo  I think my favorite was the spicy scallop crude (I'M NOT A BIG MEAT EATER DO NOT JUDGE ME!).  The bone marrow was a \"small\" portion but then I started chowing down and then realize it wasn't that small. It actually was a pretty decent size and the taste was GREAT! The and pork liver parfait was a little too salty for my taste and the (what I assumed) layer of pure fat was a bit much for me. But it still tasty that's for sure. Props to my friend though cause I really couldn't eat more than 4 - 5 baguette pieces with the spread.  She managed to be a pro and housed the rest of it down herself. Needless to say she enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"So many good things here. Bring a friend or two so you can order more dishes to try!  I had:  horse tartare spicy scallop crudo beef heart with bagna cauda and vegetables  Each was excellent in its own way.   The horse tartare was mild (not gamey) and very tender. The meat was cut into very small dice and served with seaweed papers (for making little wraps). The seaweed complimented the tartare very nicely.   The spicy scallop crudo was refreshing and light. It was paired with a citrusy drizzle and some greens. Overall, it was a very clean and zesty flavor.  The beef heart was the most surprising. I expected the heart, as a very strong muscle, to be more firm and chewy. Thanks to the quality of the food preparation, it was fairly tender.   The Black Hoof is a pretty popular place. I arrived early and there was no wait. But when my meal was concluding, I noticed a line by the door. I'd recommend eating on the earlier side, or being prepared for a wait.  I would definitely visit again. I had a great meal and would love to go back and try more dishes."}
