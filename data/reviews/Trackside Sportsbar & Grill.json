{"text":"Crystal cooks a mean burger!  Been to Trackside several times after a great days ride on the bike.  Always fun and friendly.  Decided to go one afternoon with a friend and have a burger.  Burger was great and Crystal couldn't have been nicer!  Thanks for a great burger and great afternoon at Trackside.  See ya'll soon!!"}
{"text":"Lovely place in the middle of nowhere.  Bottom floor is the bar and the second floor is a game area.  Appetizers were good and cold beer."}
{"text":"The bartender will cook you a pretty damn tasty burger and pour you a stiff drink. It's pretty much a hole in the wall biker bar in the middle of nowhere yet we love it. On the way to Wickenburg and Las Vegas  so I would stop by on the way to either if you're into dirty,dark biker bars."}
{"text":"Great little bar and grill in the middle of nowhere. Really great for locals and people looking to stop on their commute to and from Vegas."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Just enjoying to be here!!!! After party last nite, we stopped here again ! Dude, the Karaoke guy, is freaking great!!!!! Linda will serve you good and other girls too!!!!"}
{"text":"Been to this bar numerous times over the years. Its in the middle of nowhere but perfect for bikers who are on rides to and from Wickenburg to stop in for a drink and some food. They have a menu with regular bar food. Nothing fancy but good enough to fill your tummy. Drinks are good and service is always good. This place has a real homey feel to it. Lots of TV's and even a punching bag game. Arcade upstairs but Ive never seen anyone up there."}
