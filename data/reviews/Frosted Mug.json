{"text":"Chicken wings were undercooked when i ordered them and not crispy like i told the bartender, then i made a comment about them pouring my 2/3 head on my beer and they were very defensive and said it was a perfect tap system. I disagreed, and then they told me to leave. If you want to go to a please where they don't care about their beer or people, this is the place."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a child, and I can never remember being disappointed with a meal. Some things that they do that are outstanding are their Italian Hoagie, their wings, and their fried fish. I also love the grilled chicken salad, which is huge and comes with fries on top in true, Pittsburgh style. 

This may seem like your typical little bar/restaurant, extremely casual type of place, but there are things that I've just grown to love about it that make it outstanding, like the fact that it gets to feel like home with it's small town vibe.

If I have to pick somewhere to eat in my small home town, this is usually my first choice. I'll keep coming back every time I visit family and my home town."}
{"text":"Great food and service.   Had the bacon cheese burger and my friend had the ginormous fish sandwich that he never even gave me a bite of :(.  Both were very fresh and tasty.   The fries were not fresh cut, but were hot and cooked in very clean oil, so they were good as well.  I will definitely be going back.   Good prices, great food, and service.   What more can one ask for?"}
{"text":"Nice little dive bar on one side and restaurant on the other (two separated rooms).

The server was very friendly and did a good job.  Some homemade soup, salads and sandwiches.  Had a Wrap which came with a very tasty tart cole slaw on it.  Also, had some small potato pancakes as a side.   Very enjoyable meal!"}
{"text":"First time here and had their wings...they are the whole wings not the little Itty bitty little one...I had butter and garlic and my boyfriend has the seasoned.  They were very good and reasonable on the price. I will go back to try other things...they do have a wing nite and in house specials."}
