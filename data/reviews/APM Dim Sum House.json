{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in the Markham Downtown area. It is located north of the carousel on Birchmount rd near the TD bank. Parking can be scarce but you can use the parking lot at the carousel. The food is great and the dim sum is amazing too. I love the curry cuttle fish and their siu mais.  It also has the famous Chiu Chow nese style marinated duck. They also have fried noodle, congee and other snack items. The customer service was good too.  I will be coming here more often now that it is so close to work :)"}
{"text":"really delicious food. Nice dining environment and service. Highly recommend! Chicken with Green Bean is my favorite."}
{"text":"Went there with my siblings. Ordered like 3 dishes and they were just okay, nothing really special. The vegetables were super salty where we had to use water to rinse them. Service was okay. It's pretty empty."}
{"text":"I would've given this place at least 4 stars if it wasn't for the last dish that was not only terrible but also showed how poor their customer service was.   We came here around 12pm on Sunday and we were surprised how empty this place was. We were here till around 1pm and there were only a few customers.  We ordered the chiu-chow style congee with minced pork and fish ($6.99), steamed rice with garlic and shrimp in bamboo steamer ($13.99), pan-fried sticky rice ($6.99), and traditional-style deep fried noodles with sugar and vinegar ($8.99).  The congee was good. It smelled very good and was very flavourful. Lots of fish and pork also.  The shrimp rice was excellent. It was covered with lots of shrimp. The fried rice on the bottom was fried very well.  The sticky rice was not bad. A little on the sweeter side.  Now for the last - the deep fried noodles was disgusting. It came after we finished all the other dishes so we were already thinking something went wrong as it's very simple dish. Instead of using e-fu noodles as stated on the menu, it was obviously instant noodles that was extremely overcooked. From my photos you can clearly see this was not done right. I have had this dish many times at other chiu chow restaurants in Toronto and HK and never once was it like this. We told the waitress about the dish and she said it is like that. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside - she said it must've been our own tastebuds. Yes we know that. But it was SOGGY. You know that feeling when something is so bad it sticks to your throat? It was exactly that. She said many other customers love it. She didn't even bother offering to exchange for another dish? That is a basic customer service gesture from a restaurant. From other photos on yelp our dish looked completely different. The pancake was completely flat and no noodles sticking up at all. Maybe they ran out of that type of noodles? Clearly the chef did not know how to make this dish. Ever since the dish was served I saw the chef peeking out to see our reactions. Obviously there was a problem. We didn't bother to argue and just paid $8.99 leaving the entire plate untouched.   For $8.99 we were expecting a lot more than a deep fried overcooked and soggy instant noodle pancake.  This place was already empty on a Sunday lunch and you treat your customers like this? No wonder why it's so empty. Customer retention and service is crucial in order for survival in this industry. We would come back in the future if they simply replaced it with something else or removed that item from the bill but saying that it's the customer's fault is not acceptable. A noodle dish like this costs nothing for a restaurant but losing a customer is definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday. Place looks decent nice decor. We ordered 5 dimsum off the menu and 3 reggular dish. Nothing special, we find the siao long bao skin is too thick but its tasty. I noticed that they are really cutting down on their condiments didnt even have sauce for their ha gao and no ginger with their red vinegar which usually came with dippping sauce for the sia long bao. I was surprised to see the bill came up to $60. Too pricy for a regular meal, wont be planning to come back here."}
{"text":"Chiu chow | Dim Sum | Underground parking | Street parking | free wif  Parking is kind of an issue here. Limited street parking but there are underground parking available shared with residence.   811 Chiu chow mix platter Only comes with 3 things: tofu, pork belly, pork stomach. This does not come with marinated duck.  551 Fish dumpling noodle soup in (tumeric) fish stock Very interesting. Suggested to be mixed with provided lime juice. Even without that added juice it's got a bit of sour in it. They say it's made fully fish stock with added lemongrass and tumeric.  801 Chiu chow style marinated duck Its decent and served with fries tofu.  103 Shanghai pork dumpling Its okay, not bad.  Tofu dessert  A bit watery but still flavourful"}
{"text":"8:30pm Sunday we called ahead for pickup.  We ordered sweet and sour chicken, spicy deep fried turnip patties, shanghai noodles, hot and sour soup and the fish soup. They get a star for convenience and another for being nice even though the service was limited due to getting takeout. The food was all average nothing stood out it was comparable to getting food from t&t or any Chinese supermarket ...when it's discounted late night. They said they just opened up two months ago so maybe I'll go back and try the dimsum that they serve all day when I'm craving it and I live close by but on their other dishes it's a hard no.**note never order the sweet and sour chicken... this average place doesn't deserve the stars is has now"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't understand how it got 4.5 stars.  I saw the rating and wanted to come and try.  This place is sooooooooooooo hard to find, even with the address, it is not visible.  We circled around the block for like 3 times before we spotted it.  We almost gave up and left.  Also the parking situation is bad.  We didn't know where to park.  The parking spots in front of the restaurant is street parking with 20 mins limit.  At first we parked at the carousel but didn't feel comfortable worried that it would be towed.  Then when we got in and asked the staff, they said we can park underground.  It is kinda troublesome.  I don't imagine this place will get a lot of customers from outside other than ppl from the condos in the surrounding area.  Food is just average.  We have a high expectation from the fish soup noodles but it is just average.  I have had better.  Ambient is average.  The only thing that is good is service.  Service is friendly.  Will not return for sure."}
{"text":"A hidden gem.   Avoid the weekend line ups at other dim sum places in the area and head here to a new place only few know about.   The ambiance is modern. The service is awesome. The food is tasty and of good value.   It's also next to a developing mall which already has some interesting shops within it."}
{"text":"I love Chiu Chow food, so this was a real disappointment. It's not bad, but it's not good. I rather go to the one on Bayview and Major Mackenzie.   The best thing about this restaurant is that it's very clean and the decor is nice. But do note that parking is fairly impossible here - after 9pm, it's easy to catch a spot, but I can't imagine how it is during the dinner rush.   I went here for dinner as opposed to dim sum, and we ordered some very simple dishes.   The Preserved Vegetables Pork Tripe Soup was mediocre. Not enough flavour, but this is a hard dish to perfect.   The Chiu Chow Style Marinated Duck (Half) came with tofu on the bottom. No complaints, as it had a good marinated sauce.   The Chiu Chow Style Deep Fried Shrimp and Crab Balls were so-so. Very tough - overdone the frying.  Stir Fried Chicken and Green Beans with Olives lacked wok-power, but it could have just been an off night.   Deep Fried Turnip Patties with Spicy Salt lacked flavour. On the upside, their chilli oil is perfect. Lots of kick with a little drip (hence their use of a small spoon)!   For the Desert Tofu, just let them know that you liked their photo on Facebook! It was good without the sugar water, and it's soft enough. It's a lot in one can!"}
{"text":"I tried their fish soup noodle, you can tell it's fully loaded and made of real ingredients rather than MSG or something. The place is also very clean and offers a variety of healthy food options which is a plus for Chinese food."}
{"text":"This is exactly why I love using Yelp! when in an unknown (to me) neighbor hood!  Great find, quiet on Saturday mornings, Awesome service by owner, superb food and crazy portions.  Small but  very nice décor!  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Even though I've known about this place being open for several months, I only recently came by for dinner. The restaurant is clean but the decor a little confusing- some contemporary elements mixed with traditional and multicoloured lamps. But I digress. After all, we were ultimately there to eat. There are some larger tables for larger groups as well as some booths for smaller parties.  The menu is fairly extensive. The focus is on Chiu chow cuisine and all day dimsum. We ordered pork sui mai which was just mediocre.  The deep fried squid tentacles had a nice crispy texture, were flavourful but not overly chewy. Xiao long bao was not as good as Din Tai Fung but would satisfy a craving for soup dumplings in a pinch. The clay pot rice had a generous portion of pork on top and a satisfying crunchy texture to the rice. Finally the fried green beans with pork were delicious and I'd come back just to eat this dish.   Although not the best dim sum place I've ever been, APM Chinese restaurant offers an all day dim sum option in the neighbourhood of Downtown Markham."}
{"text":"The service was great and felt very welcomed upon arrival. I have been there several times now and it did not take long until the food was served. Their dishes were of quality, tasted scrumptious, and their price was considerably fair and reasonable.  Furthermore, the seats and environment were both very comfortable and a great atmosphere to experience.    The initial dilemma, however, pertains to an inadequate amount of street parking outside the restaurant and the lack of instructions to accessable parking lots.  Although, street parking is the most convenient, an easy solution is to park in the carousel parking lot around the corner or visitors' underground parking in the appartment building.  All in all, I highly recommend this location as they have high expectations in their foods and costumer services."}
{"text":"Downtown Markham Chui Chow option on ground floor retail of condo above.  Place was quiet food was decent so was the server.  Food was good tried the turmeric fish soup noodle which has a distinct taste and texture not everyone may like, the duck was really good because it was de-boned nice touch I thought. Will try again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a place that serves chiu chow food in markham. There's not many choices.   Came on a cold windy weekday evening in early April. We could see at the wait staff and kitchen staff sitting around in the dining area. There were not customers. Three staff in total.   We were hesitate to go in, as there was no one else there. We saw another party go in and we proceeded to follow them.   Marinated duck was that good. It was alright. Wasn't served/ plates the usual way like other chiu chow restaurants with the thinly sliced duck. Could hear them heating up the duck in the mircrowave.   Chiu chow congee was all right. Not the best not the worst.   Utensils and plates could be cleaner. Same goes for the bamboo steamers for the dim sum. Could see reminents  of buns left in the steamers.  Service was not too as well. Thought they would be more enthusiastic since they had no customers. A little too much hovering and service with very few words exchange."}
{"text":"Decided to give this a try because of all the good reviews. Food is just average, nothing outstanding. That fish noodle is not bad, but overpriced like other mentioned. Tried that Beef stomach appetizer, one of the ingredient got changed from the picture. Satay Beef fried noodle,  just average. The crystal buns, not that good. The plain vege dish is good price and good portion. Parking is limited outside. Not worth a visit unless you live upstairs and want to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Always in search of new places to try, my fellow Yelp Elite, Jennifer K. and I ended up at APM Dim Sum House. It wasn't the easiest place to find due to a lack of proper signage and we both missed the underground parking. Maybe we're just going blind.  For a new place, a lot of items on the menu were blocked out. We ordered a few dishes, including the Chiu Chow Dumplings and Chiu Chow Duck, house specialties. We soon found out that they didn't have any duck so we ordered pork belly.  The food tasted good but not outstanding. The pork belly and minced pork with rice in hot pot were nice. The spareribs and dumplings could have used a little more moisture and larger portions. It was a little pricey compared to other dim sum places I've been to. Overall, it was decent but maybe not enough for a return visit (compared to other places)."}
{"text":"I was blown away.  I shouldn't be, but I was.  It has been a very, very long time that I have truly authentic Chiu Chow food in Toronto.  APM does have all day dim sum, and I suspect the clientele in downtown Markham would like it.  What I ordered and loved, though, were the Chiu Chow dinner dishes: oyster pancake, the Chiu Chow chicken stir fry and the noodle in fish broth.  Do I have words to describe the food in detail?  Nope.  I can only say the time and work that was put into cooking these deserve respect.  Simple food, simple ingredients, loads of craftsmanship. The chefs knew what they were cooking and how to cook them."}
{"text":"*Free full size (its huge) steamed tofu pudding if you go to their Facebook page and 'like' one of their dishes. One per person, not per table - so awesome!*   Came here for dinner and not for the dim sum! Unlike the English name of this restaurant, the Chinese name actually say they serve Chiu Chow cuisine (a type of Chinese cuisine).  I ordered the Chiu Chow Style Marinated Duck (a must for chiu chow food), house special seafood fried rice, and  pork belly w/ preserved vegetables. I think the pork belly was most well done out of the 3 dishes - it just melts in your mouth, and it actually comes with some small bok choy in addition to the preserved vegetables, which counterbalances the oil in this dish. The fried rice was average but the portion is quite generous for the price! Marinated duck is great and it comes with some marinated tofu, but I just love this dish in general! The service was great even when I asked for the free tofu pudding with Facebook 'like'. She even told us it's big and we can order two to share amongst the three of us and save one free one for next time. It was a great experience!   I will definitely be back to try their Fish Maw w/ Snow Pea Leaf as I saw a lot of tables order it, and will try their dim sum as well!"}
{"text":"True neighborhood gem! Love their turmeric fish broth vermicelli and all day dim sum idea! Fish dumplings are also available for sale as a side.   Owner and all servers are also friendly, and proud of how the turmeric fish broth was made- they will be happy to tell you all about it!"}
{"text":"Good food, price is one to two dollars more expensive than average but come with a good portion. Most dishes are delicious, only a few are just mediocre. Overall pretty good experience, would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it a 3.5 stars. A few goods. And a few cons. But I'd rather give it a 4 rather than a 3 because it's new. And the boss lady was kind.  The good!  Clean  nice decor. Tea pot uses ikea French press. (Nice touch) and nice cutlery.  I had their signature fish soup. The xo fried turnip cake was amazing. Probably best I had. And their satay with beef and broccoli in satay. Which was good.  Slight cons. Limited parking situation. Not visible sign. So passed it a few times. And their fish soup was over priced in my opinion.  But all in all. A good experience"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch and was surprised that this restaurant was so busy! I ordered some dim sum as well as their chiu chow dishes to try and everything tasted very authentic.  The dim sums were actually just average.  The xiao long bao's skin was too thick and it was obviously not their forté, better to just stick with restaurants that specialize in Shanghai dim sum. The Shao Mai was also a bit too stiff, may have not been steamed for long enough.  The char siew bao however was very soft and full of flavorful meat! I ordered their mapo tofu and yeung chow fried rice and both were delicious! They were both very flavorful and not too oily and the portions were big for the price as well.   I was a lot more impressed by their authentic chiu chow dishes rather than their dim sum. Definitely  recommend this place if anyone is looking for a taste of real Chinese dishes. I hope to visit again for dinner time and to bring family with me, as they have large tables for big groups as well!  PS. Parking was a hassle to find, as street parking is very limited. However, there is an underground parking lot in between two condos where you can park for free and walk straight up to the restaurant through stairs or you can take the elevator too."}
{"text":"We went there since it has been opened for a while and we never get a chance to try it out Environment was so-so, there were no tv and they played Cantonese musics all over via YouTube I assumed. Service was not great, waitresses were not attentive, they missed several of our orders. Food was weird, waiting time was very long. They have a sweet and sour noodles on their menu and it ended up being not the orange sauce we'd normally presumed but literally sugar and vinegar to pair with the noodles... It was not pleasant seeing their staff eating and missed our orders. But I guess it's reasonable to see them not having a lot of customers after this dining experience. Won't even bother going back given their price is not average and their quality of food is not particularly good. There are so many better Chiu Chow cuisine in Markham that's way worth the experience."}
{"text":"I totally agree w/ other Yelpers on the Chiu Chow portion of their menu, it was good.  My wife loved their \"Lo Shui\" duck, tofu, etc.  If anyone is up for some Lo Shui duck, etc, this is the right place."}
{"text":"Decent place for lunch with quite a few options. No steamed rice noodle rolls though, which was surprising for a dim sum place. The prices are all right, though more expensive than the average dim sum restaurant because they serve you. The wrappings for the shrimp dumpling and other steamed dumplings is silky smooth and has a nice bounce to bite into. The siu mai seems freshly made (it better have been, because it took about 20 minutes for them to bring it out). The bbq pork buns are on the small side and only average-tasting. The steamed spare-ribs have a smooth texture but not enough black bean for taste. The congee is okay well for about $5; it's smooth, but could have more toppings in each one."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new dim sum restaurant on Birchmount Rd with underground parking. The taste and portions are just right and they specialize in Chiu Chow dishes such as marinated duck, tofu, tripe, etc, and regular dim sum options like spring rolls, spare ribs, congee, siu Mai, etc.   One improvement they need to make is putting a panel or wall in front of the men's washroom otherwise, each time their door opens anyone walking past has a clear view of the urinal and the un-pantsed customer.  Gah! Think of the children!"}
{"text":"This is a fairly new restaurant that has a Chiu Chow menu and also all day dim sum. Came here for lunch on a weekday and it was pretty quiet, but the service was good and quick. I tried their signature fish broth noodles and the braised Lo Sui platter, which were both a little meh, but I do feel their menu is worth another chance to try."}
{"text":"I am not really sure why APM would market itself as a \"dim sum house\"? Personally I find that's their weakiest link! There are so many great dim sum restaurants in the area and I would strongly recommend you go elsewhere for dim sum.  APM strongest offering is their specialty Chiu Chow items on their menu!  The Marinated Braised Pork Belly  ????? ($9.99) was just the prettiest I seen with the distinguished layers of alternative fat and lean. Melt in your mouth tenderness and flavourable. The Hot Pot Rice ????????? ($9.99) was a winner too with a sharp savory profile from the preserved veggie.  Both dim sum items we ordered: Chiu Chow Dumplings ???? ($3.99) and Spare Ribs ????($3.99)  were such a letdown.  I will probably be back for their Chiu Chow speciality. But for some, all day dim sum might have their appeal."}
{"text":"Excellent food and typical service. The only drawback being that this place is pretty small."}
{"text":"APM is a new canto fusion restaurant that opened near Downtown Markham.   I went with my family for Thanksgiving dinner. Here's a breakdown of what we ordered: - - marinated duck - would highly recommend this dish. I think it's one of their signatures. The duck wasn't too fatty or greasy, and the flavours were very prominent - Xiaolong bao - not a fan and would not recommend. The meat was tight, the insides were dry, and it felt like they were from a frozen package - Curry fish vermicelli soup - this one was a big strange... especially since most Chinese restaurants don't really use coconut based curries, especially as soup bases. It wasn't as good as a Singaporean Laksa, but it had a homey taste to it  - steamed garlic shrimp rice - this one was just really overpriced. They literally put a boat load of rice into a bamboo steamer, sprinkled some garlic and dried shrimp and called it a day. It tasted as the description says, but there's really nothing special about it - sweet and sour fish - typical dish - stir fry beef - typical dish  Being a NEW restaurant in the heart of Downtown Markham, I guess I came in with really high expectations. Even many franchises that opened hear have really beautiful, modern redesign. But this place was just ordinary. The service was relatively fast and courteous, and the decor didn't really have a prevalent theme. I would say this is your typical canto fusion resto."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times before but wasn't able to check in on yelp since it was still brand new.  Love the food here.  Pretty yummy and they have lots of dimsum dishes to choose from.  I love the deep fried turnip patties.  It's like having crack lol  Great place for Chinese if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I live upstairs in the same building and have been waiting for a good restaurant to open!  I ordered a few items to go just a few days after they opened and they did not disappoint.  I tried combination fried rice, crispy shrimp rolls and pork steamed buns - all delicious!  The staff were friendly and very helpful.  They were sure to point out some items that hadn't yet made it onto the takeout menu, including dim sum.  Did I mention they have all day dim sum??  Be sure to bring cash as they don't have a card machine just yet.  Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Cantonese restaurant in town. It is so convenient since I live upstairs, it's a gem in this neighbourhood.  The food is always very satisfyingly delicious, every dish is sooo good. That's very very difficult for a restaurant.  They even pick the vegetables so carefully to make sure there's no single bad leaf.  I'm so glad We have it here."}
