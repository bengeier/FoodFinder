{"text":"For over four years, my wife  and I have relied on Salted Caramel Catering for out events ranging from 2 to over 200 people. I can always count on Daniela's food and presentation being amazing, fresh and plentiful. This time she didn't disappoint, as well. My wife contacted her without my knowledge to help with the coordination of my surprise 50th birthday party and everything was executed perfectly. The food was delicious, the entertainment tasteful and intriguing and the event memorable. My friends still talk about the party.Â I never worry when I know Daniela is in charge and so my wife didn't when she hired Salted Caramel to organize my big day! Thanks again to you and your team, Daniela!"}
{"text":"We hired Salted Caramel Catering as the caterer and day-of coordinator for our December 2015 wedding after we heard about it through a family member. I cannot recommend Daniela and her staff highly enough - our day was perfect. Throughout our entire planning process, she and her team were so quick and responsive and really took into consideration every single one of our ideas and requests. We described our general idea and the look and feel we were going for and Daniela executed everything even better than I could have ever imagined it. On top of all of that, the food was absolutely amazing and so many of our guests commented that it was the best food they've had at a wedding, not to mention the best wedding they had ever been to! I highly recommend Salted Caramel for any event you are planning and can't wait until I can plan another event so we can work with Daniela and her team again!"}
{"text":"My husband hired Salted Caramel to cater my 40th birthday party for about 40 people. Everything was perfect!  The food was amazing and everyone kept commenting on how delicious everything was!  Everything was presented in a very elegant way and they thought of every tiny little detail! Val and Daniella were so professional, friendly and easy to work with.  They came the day before to set everything up and came the day after the party to clean up. I would definitely recommend Salted Caramel if you want an upscale and extravagant party that will surely impress everyone there!  Thank you ladies!"}
{"text":"I used Salted Caramel for my bridal shower and I was so impressed with every single detail and services they provided. Not only was the food absolutely delicious but they go above and beyond what you would expect from a catering company. The display of the food was so incredible and they even brought in a beautiful centerpiece to tie everything together. They decorated my entire shower and thought of every single detail down to the napkins and plates. They really made my shower a huge hit and I will definitely be using them for all future events. Thank you Salted Caramel for making my shower perfect!"}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to share about SaltedCaramel catering business. Recently, I have celebrated my bday party with about 40 guests in our home. It was by far the most lavish and extravagant party I have attended ever in my life and it was my party:-) My guests were amazed from the moment they entered through the door to the moment they had to leave - flower arrangements everywhere, tall bar tables with beautiful decorations, cheese and fruit platter, large table decorated with amazing food which was more art than food. From the set up to the food everything was absolutely astonishing! Daniella Scott and Val met with me once to walk through the details and through the quick conversation we had they already knew exactly what will make me happy. We decided on 8 cold appetizer, 4 warm appetizers and diner with a small cake, but there was just so much more. The food was truly a work of art which could very well be part of a 5-star restaurant. Daniella and her crew were absolutely professional, they set up away from guests view and food just kept coming. I have traveled enough and had the opportunity to eat at some of the best restaurants in the world, but this has been really a top notch experience. I would highly recommend Daniella and SaltedCaramel to anyone looking to have a great time, great food and wow their guests. SaltedCaramel will be my go-to companies for my future parties as well."}
{"text":"They were amazing! The food was amazing, and they were incredible with helping pick up after everyone was finished eating! The food was set up so beautifully and I have been craving the chicken salad sandwiches since!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best catering in town! We have used them several times and have never been happier. Extremely professional, amazing food and such pleasant people to work with. Salted caramel has never let us down. Thank you for always going above and beyond to make our events perfect."}
{"text":"Daniella and Salted Caramel catered my graduation party. Her Beef Medallion, Sesame Chicken Tenders, potato wedges, homemade bread both with and without feta cheese, and traditional Bulgarian Banitza were mouthwatering. If you want quality food which will leave your guest wanting more Salted Caramel is the catering company you need to hire for your next event."}
{"text":"Would not use or recommend this company. We initially hired them to cater our wedding but had problems from day one. Val (the coordinator) was extremely unorganized, and never followed up after emails were sent to her. I constantly had to ask her to respond and it got to the point that I had to speak to Daniella (the chef) about her twice. Finally, after being chastised, Val sent an email apologizing for her lack of follow-through.   The deal breaker came after we had spoken about the set up for the wedding. We mentioned the need for tables and chairs not only while we were visiting with her in person, but also via email correspondence. Somehow Val took it upon herself one day to erase the conversation from her mind that we needed tables and chairs and it was only after we spoke to her asking to see the chairs that we were informed of such.   When dealing with people's money and important dates communication is HUGE. Val clearly knows nothing about how to communicate properly. We wasted our time even interviewing her, and are now forced to find a new caterer.   The only saving grace about this disastrous company is the fact Daniella (the chef) is wonderful and gave us a refund. DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY."}
{"text":"We have used this catering service a few times and absolutely love it. Daniela is very professional and has made every event very special for us. The guests can't stop talking about our parties long after they are over. The display of the delicious dishes she serves is stunning. I highly highly recommend this catering service, you will impress all your guests and make wonderful memories in all your parties!"}
{"text":"I had Daniela and salted caramel cater a holiday party. Their food is amazing and I felt well cared for from the first moment. We had some picky eaters and when going over everything Daniela came up with a solid 3 course meal. The highlight for me was actually the green bean dish just because they were the best green beans I ever had! We did some filets and ribs and the sauces and glazes they make are outstanding! And the giant cake and varies types of cannoli were works of art. Inventive, full of flavor and perfect execution. Thanks Salted Caramel!"}
{"text":"We went to a large new years eve party attended by over 200 people that was catered by Salted Caramel. Each of the courses served from the appetizers, through the salads to the main courses and finally the desserts were amazing. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. I particularly enjoyed the pork chops smothered with mushrooms and onions. The desserts were extravagent. I particularly enjoyed the baklava that was of a quality rarely experienced in US. The panna cotta cream was a decadent treat. That Salted Caramel was able to prepare gourmet dishes of such a high quality for such a large group of people is a testiment to their profesionalism and attention to detail. I highly recommend this catering company to anyone planning an event large or small."}
