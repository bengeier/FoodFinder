{"text":"Just got take out, they sold out of a couple of items so we ended up with the chicken shawarma with Greek salad  and kofta plate with tabouleh. Hubby and I both agree shawarma was a real treat. So delicious and generous with portions. The owners were so pleasant. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I totally picked this place because of the amazing reviews! They did NOT disappoint at all. I got a Shawarma Mix (Beef and Chicken) with fries which was seasoned to perfection. Also a hamburger sandwich which was really good as well. I will admit I did use a food courier service so the food wasn't as warm as it should have been BUT overall amazing. My new spot!"}
{"text":"Great local place - that is very welcoming to visitors

Very friendly people, didn't know what to think at first, but the food was excellent, perfectly cooked, incredibly spiced, a great value, would pay twice as much any where else.  Don't expect fancy service, just expect great food at a great price from entertaining people.

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to order through skip the dishes, it was very quick. Wrap was a little cold but it's winter and that's totally expected. I didn't know it would be so big and filled with such a great amount of toppings. They are not one of those places that rations out toppings or sauces, which is great! I used to live in Mississsauga and they have some of the best shawarma and it's hard to find a good place in Markham- now I have! Will definitely eat here again with no hesitation. Can't wait to take my boyfriend and let everyone know about this gem!  

Great taste, great value!"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma  juicy chicken, fresh toppings, clean restaurant, super friendly service! Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Owner was quite pleasant. Food was delicious and there was a promotion for 20% off the menu price as they were newly opened. 

I had the barg kabob plate with potatoes and salad. It was definitely worth the price. The beef was plentiful, however it was just a tad overcooked (I had requested medium rare). It was still good nonetheless."}

I'VE FOUND ANOTHER HIDDEN GEM! 
I mean, look at that 5 star overall rating - it's gotta count for something.

I came here last night to grab a mixed shawarma wrap because of sudden cravings arisen from watching the newest Avengers trailer - AND LET ME TELL YOU - wow, value was on point. \"Walk-in purchases\" get 20% off so my wrap came out to be $6.77 after tax and it was HUGE. So much good food for such little money, what else can you ask for?
Oh right - they're also a super nice family-run business, well-lit and clean on the inside, and they open late!!  

My only advice is: the chicken tastes better than the beef option (it's more tender) and I don't know if it's the sauce or meat itself but it was pretty salty so ask for less sauce. 

Overall, I would 100% come back again in the future."}
{"text":"TL;DR: AMAZINGLY friendly service, generously stuffed wraps, fresh toppings, moist and flavourful meat. Eat here. Just do it.

I stumbled upon this hidden gem while browsing yelp and BOY, am I glad I decided to pay this place a visit. This place is hidden in an inconspicuous corner within a small collection of restaurants on Main Steet Markham and shares their space with a convenience store. I was greeted with big smiles from the owner; already making my day. Friendly, personable, and knows how to entertain as he prepares my food: that's my kind of service.

I decided to order a mixed shawarma wrap and shawarma poutine (didn't see this on their monitors but I knew it existed because of yelp pictures.) As he piled on the toppings, I started wondering whether he'd be able to close the thing because HE PILED IT SO HIGH and SO GENOROUSLY with all the very fresh toppings. Lo and behold, he wraps it and kindly explains how I should go about unwrapping it so as not to have everything fall out. I also asked for extra hot sauce as I always do with all my food and he didn't disappoint. He loaded on the sauces on both wrap and poutine while at the same time making it entertaining to watch. 

The wrap was heavenly to bite into with the smokey grilled meat flavours exploding through the sauces and other toppings. As I ate, I was again amazed at how much filling he fit into that little piece of bread. Delicious, juicy, and not as messy as I thought it'd be despite the amount of sauce. 

The shawarma poutine pales in comparison to the wrap but it was also delicious. He starts with fries, throws on the CHEESE CURDS and tops it off with loads of white sauce and of course, he didn't forget my extra hot sauce. Gotta have the sauce. Sauce makes everything better. I KNOW I'll be back very soon for a quick comforting bite."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! Tried the place because I love family run places, and I think this is my favourite by far! The family was so welcoming and sweet! The food was out of this world delicious and wraps were generously filled! Good prices and the place was very clean! I will definitely be heading here so much more times! I encourage all to try it!!"}
{"text":"Tucked into the corner of the plaza besides LCBO and the Markham GO Station, Santa Maria wants to be one of your one-stop shops for any day of the week. From a growing collection of convenience fare, to a professional espresso machine capable of doling out a variety of traditional cafe drinks, and a deli counter, to their (bigger than I thought it could get) grill and dining area, Santa Maria is unlike any convenience store you'll step into.

As the chef was preparing my shawarma mix wrap (chicken + beef; $5.99), I couldn't believe how many ingredients were being packed into it - talk about a bang for your buck. It was a delicious meal that I had to share with my brother and dad (not because I couldn't finish it but because it's too good not to). For the very hungry, one wrap will definitely fill you up. 

I have yet to try the deli selection and the cafe menu but look forward to doing so! I'll probably walk out with takeout from the grill too."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife on a Friday night.  This place is both a convenience store and a restaurant so this place is more of a fast food type of joint than a nice place to sit around and chill (although you can).

I like this place and give it 4 stars.  I got the wrap and the bread was soft when you bite into it.  My wife enjoyed the rice and the chicken / beef meat mix.  

Now, I want to add that my wife did get a stomach ache a few hours after eating here but I was fine.  I can't say that my wife's tummy ache was because of this place.  While we were eating here she enjoyed the food.  

Overall, I would still recommend this place.  They do offer a 20% discount for walk ins but then I think the price the foods a bit high to begin with, so the discount really takes you back to paying an \"average\" price."}
{"text":"Came here based on previous good reviews. Good location as it's across the street from the makrham Go station. You can grab a bit after getting off the train/ bus. Parking in the plaza is not an issue as well. It is a store with a food counter. Sharwama was delicious and filled with lots of veggies. Though the pita was burnt and blAck, which has a bitter taste. Didn't say anything, even though I saw it while he was making it. Owner was vet warm and chatted with me as well.  Overall, clean and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great would recommend for sure. Good portions and delicious! I didn't even ask and the owner suggested a mix of chicken and beef for the plate. Nice variety store close to downtown on Main Street."}
{"text":"The best Shawarma I've had in Toronto or the GTA. Perhaps even the best I've had outside the middle east. It's authentic, rich in flavour and every single bite feels likes the first. I must give it to the chef, he's ingredients are second to none."}
{"text":"I first saw the sign and was confused, convenience and grill house? I decided to go in and see what it's like. Boy am I glad I came in! I got the chicken kebab wrap. They have tons of toppings to choose from and a variety of drinks that you can buy from the convenience store. The wrap was absolutely delicious! The place was clean and tidy and very comfortable seating. 
Convenience and grill house, who knew?

Would I come back? Most definitely!"}
{"text":"My dining companion and I, always looking for new places to eat at, consulted Yelp for places in her neighbourhood and came across this place. 4 1/2 stars, eh? Must be good. Only 16 reviews? We'll give it a try.

Walking in through the front door (there's a side door), this is a convenience store. Oh, the food is at the back to the right. It smells good.

The menu appears to be a mix of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine, with kebobs, shawarma, kofta, Greek salad, and more to choose from.

The steak that just came off the grill smelled and looked really good but we ordered some chicken and beef shawarma. We quickly changed our order to a mixed grill platter which included that delicious smelling steak, chicken, and kofta. We also had the shawarma that was already sliced off.

The steak was delicious and very tender, albeit a little underdone (medium rare) for my companion. Too bad for her! The chicken, kofta, and shawarma were all perfectly seasioned and cooked. Very tasty. The Greek salad (included) was also delicious.

The cook/owner(?) came over to check on us and we struck up a conversation. He described the food as a little bit of all his favourite foods, not just one cuisine. Come and check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  It took me a long time to convince my husband to try it and was happy when he agreed today.  

Order:
Shwarma Beef Plate with Potatoes and a Caeser Salad - the beef was dry and salty.  Potatoes and salad were good.

Hamburger described online as \"A beef patty served on a grilled hamburger bun with your choice of freshly chopped toppings.\" - they called to say that they don't do burgers so it came in a wrap which was fine.  However, a dryer more burnt burger patty I have never seen.  It was bitter, also.  

Falafel Plate with Rice and Greek Salad - Salad was good, crisp lettuce, sweet tomatoes, delicious olives.  Rice, fluffy and tasty.  Falafels - I could feel them going down my esophagus 

None of us could finish our meals. :("}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp. Not really that busy but the food was really filling and pretty good value! The owners are so friendly too. There isn't that much seating here but to be honest most people seem to get take out so that isn't a problem."}
{"text":"Tasty!  Chicken shawarma plate was great, very tasty humus... super kind staff. And they treat you like family.  Kinda funny dining area and ambiance but all forgiven given the tasty food!! Highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the mix shawarma they give you lots of meat. Finally a place that isn't afraid to load up wrap. One tiny thing was the beef was slightly dry but it was still great food spot. Overall will come again. Def must try."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick bite since it was a bit late. I decided on finally trying Santa Maria Grill. 

I wish I had tried it sooner this place is great!  I was a little worried that since it was almost closing that the quality of the food would suffer. I was totally wrong! 

I went with the Chicken Shawarma Wrap. The chicken was super moist and tender. The seasonings on the chicken was fantastic. Super fresh! They have all the usual shawarma toppings. A plus was that they added tzatziki and pickled hot peppers. This was a nice touch. The pita was very soft. It wasn't the usual thin pita, more like the thick pita like you would get for a gyro. It was perfection!

The owners said this wrap would be addictive. I would have to agree. I just finished it and I'm craving another!

I can't wait to go back and try some of the other items on the menu. 

I will post some photos next time. I was too hungry to snap some picks tonight. 

I tried the Filet Mignon Wrap tonight and it was super tender and they cook it to your linking. Amazing. Photo attached of Filet Wrap!

Try Santa Maria Grill you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Found this place while reviewing yelp for something new to try in the Markham area.   
It was a place I drive by on my way home everyday.   With so many great reviews I had to check it out. 

I dropped by on my way home from work.  Had a great conversation with the owner (Sorry forgot to ask for his name).   I was surprised to find out its been here for about a year.  

Ask him what we would  recommend and he gave me a few of his favorite. 

I went with the classic choice - Chicken Sharwarma.   This definitely did not disappoint.   It was loaded with chicken and all the fixings.  Chicken was moist and very flavorful.   Veggies  are fresh. Sauce tasty.   There are some places that barely give you any toppings and meat in their wraps and charge a lot more.   Here you get what you pay for and more.  More as in the taste.  Everything work well together and can't wait to try the item on the menu.  Or grab a few more items for dinner for the family.

This was definitely a great find."}
{"text":"Yummy food, very friendly service. Found it on Yelp, and so glad I did. Had a fatoush salad with chicken shawarma on top, and my friend had a Falafel sandwich. The owner, George, was very friendly and personable, and was telling us how the falafels are his mom's recipe. I'll have to try the falafels next time!"}
{"text":"The Santa Maria Grill is a food court style restaurant hidden inside a convenience store, behind the LCBO. You could walk past it a thousand times and never even know it was there. But walk past it and you'll definitely smell the aroma of grilled meat.

We came in on a whim after searching yelp for a new place to eat, and it was worth it. The chef was very friendly, and the prices are very reasonable for what you get. The food portions at a glance don't look large, but those containers are tall.

I had the mixed shawarma plate with rice and tabouleh salad. 

The meat was very flavourful and tastes amazing with their homemade hot sauce. However, it's a bit on the salty side, so make sure you have it with rice or potatoes. 

The tabouleh salad was a little disappointing. I've never had tabouleh before though, so maybe I don't know what it's supposed to taste like. While it was very fresh and provides a nice cut to the saltiness of the meat, I found it to be rather bland. It just tasted like plain parsley. I would have liked it if there was some lemon juice or vinegar in it to balance the meal.

For what you pay, Santa Maria Grill provides good value, friendly service, and a full tummy."}
{"text":"Great shawarma! I got 3 of them before I left, very decently priced as well. I haven't had shwarma this good in a long time!"}
{"text":"This place is all I look for in a local food joint. 

Amazing food, great value, and amazing service from a family run place. 

Tried the mixed platter. Filet mignon was favourite but they were all good.  Amazing hot sauce. 

Definitely be back."}
{"text":"3.5

Santa Maria Grill shares the same storefront with a Convenience Store.  When you walk in, it is on your right hand side at the back area.

20% off walk in order

Mixed Shawarma Wrap ($7.49 with discount $5.99) is quite filling with all the meat and toppings! I would suggest though go for either chicken or beef not mixed then at least you know exactly what protein you are eating.

Great for lunch. And I will be back for a quick bite if I have craving for a hearty sandwich. 

There are also some seating if you do want to dine in."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch take-out; had chicken shawarma entree with 2 chocies of sides (roasted potatoes and rice ). Chicken shawarma was delicious; juicy meat and full flavour. However portion could be bigger. 

The menu said 20% for walk in order. I did ask about it but didnt get the discount. They seem inconsistent with the discount, some yelpers got it while others didn't. 

Overall, it's a good place for a quick bite if you are in the area"}
