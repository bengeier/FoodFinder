{"text":"Inventive cocktail creations complete with offerings of trusty classics. Enjoyed my Murray Hill cocktail as a lighter, effervescent and less tomatoey version of a Bloody Mary. We got shareable beginner plates, including the chicken wings, prosciutto wrapped shrimp, pierogies, and crab cakes. Each were coupled with interesting sauces (whipped blue cheese on the wings) or aoili that I unashamedly fork fed in my mouth once food was all gone. Crab cakes were fresh and paired with an aioli that had a perfect kick to it."}
{"text":"We came here on Wednesday night and it wasn't very crowded yet our server took 45 minutes to bring our food (we had ordered salads and side dishes, no complicated entrees). We also heard two other tables complaining about how long it was taking to get their servers' attention.   I don't usually get upset about service, but the food wasn't good either. The salad was gritty, like there was sand or dirt in it. The mac and cheese was fine but nothing to write home about. As for my husbands food, The cauliflower soup would have been fine but may have been sitting out for a while, it had a layer of congealed soup on top. The wedge salad was good.   Its such an excellent location, and we really wanted to love it. Please get it together parkers!"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful gem in Cleveland. In the Kimpton Schofield hotel at ninth and Euclid, you have a great place to stop in before a play or sporting event. I haven't sat in the dining room, only at the bar, but the service could not be more friendly and enjoyable. The manager, Eric, knows his cocktails and works hard to put together wonderful concoctions that taste just as good as they look. Quality ingredients, interesting flavours, and combinations. Strong, but you can't taste it and not too sweet or sugary. The food is also good. A collection of bar snacks including dips and finger food, as well as a posh tinned fish menu from Europe."}
{"text":"Like most of the Kimpton Hotel restaurants I've visited, the food is decent. I have had 2 of the steaks (the filet was overcooked, but delicious...the other cut was ok) and halibut (again, just ok).   The reason to keep coming back (aside from great, friendly service and a beyond serviceable wine and beer selection) is for the appetizers. Namely the smoked chicken wings and loaded pub fries. Both are heavenly and they go well together, making for a very filling meal for one and a very filling app for 2 or more.   So glad to have a Kimpton in Cleveland. I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of hotel bars and restaurants, particularly nice hotels.  Some of the most interesting dates and conversations I have had have taken place in that environment.  They have a certain charm and ambiance to them.  So when I  was looking for a place to grab a bite to eat after people watching the final night of the convention and saw that Parker's Downtown was finally open, I had to stop in.  Located on the ground level of The Schofield Hotel, Parker's definitely has the charm.  It features intimate seating, views of Heinen's and the 9 and walls adorning industrial photos of the bridges and skyline from the Flats. Their menu has a nice mix of upscale dishes and comfort foods with a twist.    Unfortunately the bar was full tonight, so I grabbed a seat at a table. While a steak was sounding good, I decided instead to go the comfort route and tried the Chicken Pot Pie.  The presentation caught me off guard.  Instead of a traditional pastry crust, it featured a few small pastry puffs on the top.  The chicken was also prepared airline style (on the bone) which made it a little cumbersome to eat.  But the flavor?  Wow.  Every bite was amazing.  The chicken.  The pastry.  The mushrooms and greens.  And especially the sauce. This may have been simultaneously the most unorthodox and most delicious pot pie I have ever had.  My only regret was that there wasn't more pastry, or frankly more pie, or a seat at the bar and some stimulating political conversation to accompany it with."}
{"text":"Beautiful location with great decor. Waitstaff was so pleasant. Food was excellent, and the drinks were amazing. The cauliflower soup is excellent. The bartender turns mixed drinks on their heads into amazing creations. Will def go back."}
{"text":"Went to Parker's Wednesday night to watch the Cav's game and had a wonderful experience! Sat at the bar, promptly greeted, and the drinks were amazing. The girls behind the bar were absolutely lovely, and I look forward to going there again when I'm back in Cle. Being in the industry, I witnessed some nastiness towards them from other customers...all I can say is that they handled it with grace, which is far more than you can say for most. Kudos to them!"}
{"text":"Food was just so so. Could not substitute feta cheese in the omelette.  I was told the chef would not allow. I sence the omelette was pre made. Looked like tasted like airline food when airlines had food. Dont confuse with the great hotel the restaurant is in."}
{"text":"Ok so it's new but.... Menu is very limited and although not crowded service was incredibly slow. With all the great places to eat in Cleveland, if this place doesn't step it up, it's not likely to survive. Can't recommend it. Waffle breakfast 1 waffle with banana slices but no syrup for $12."}
{"text":"Let's be clear: this restaurant is not run by Bosley Parker.  Though we'd all love him to reappear on the scene, it's not related.  The owner named this after his son Parker.   The ambiance is nice and well designed. Not noisy at all, though we had to ask for the AC to be turned down.  Our server was perfect: informed and able without being pushy or nosey. The wine list is great, but the sever warned us that they only have a bottle or 2 of each.   The appetizers where sheik takes on traditions like Meatballs and pirogies.  Unique flavors. The mains were all very well thought out and tasty. Don't waste your time on the burger, really nothing special. But the lamb had a wonderful taziki that melts in your mouth, and the sole was soft and perfect.    They only have 3 deserts. Get one of each."}
{"text":"Made a quick stop at Parkers for a beverage before a concert at House of Blues. I really like how the drink menu features drinks themed after local areas of Cleveland-y things. I tried the Murray Hill cocktail. It was awesome! A salt, pepper and balsamic rim with a garnish of fresh mozzarella and basil. It was like drinking a caprese salad. Delicious!  The only reason I didn't give this place a 5 is because I didn't get a chance to try the food although it smelled great too. Can't wait to give the food a try too!"}
{"text":"I typically avoid hotel restaurants due to their tendency of being overpriced and mediocre, corporate chains, or both. I am pleased to say that after dining at Parker's Downtown two nights running, my mind is more open to the possibilities. Lady-friend and I spent two nights at The Schofield Hotel and enjoyed top notch service, food, and cocktails both nights at Parker's. Saturday night was a full house, yet we were seated immediately at a wonderful 2 top in the lounge. John was beyond fantastic and mixed a superb Old Fashioned called, The Standard. The Roasted Date app was salty and creamy, the bacon lending just the right smoke and crunch. We shared the Chicken Pot Pie and it was perfect. A deconstructed format, the chicken was beautifully prepared, the filling was silky and flavorful, and the \"crust\" was 3 perfect rounds of puff pastry. We rounded out the evening with the Carrot Cake Shots. Holy mother...dessert is one of my 4 food groups and this did not disappoint. Flavorful, moist cake filled with orange cream cheese frosting...simply sublime. This evening, we split the Shrimp and Grits, a Parker Burger, as well as The Canterbury (can't go wrong with anything containing Four Roses) and a pint of Platform's Oatmeal Stout. The entrees were prepared beautifully; the grits were flavorful with chorizo, aged cheddar, pepper conserva, and a gorgeous 45-minute egg. The shrimp were tender and not skimpy. The burger was cooked to order, the good ol American cheese just right for enjoying a beer this snowy evening. The pub fries were addictive adding a nice salty sidekick to the sandwich. We couldn't resist a 2nd night of dessert and opted for the Pineapple Upside Down Cake with a Redbreast Irish Coffee. The cake is a new addition to the menu and was outstanding. Substantial and flavorful, hearty enough to withstand the fruit and caramelization, it will make you reconsider passing over this time worn standby. A good sized scoop of vanilla bean ice cream paired nicely and coffee with booze is always a winner. Spencer was friendly and adept while managing a full crowd at the rail. Hats off to the leadership team this evening for noticing his constraints and jumping in to take care of us in the moment. We will certainly return...probably tomorrow morning for breakfast ahead of our departure!"}
{"text":"My sister and I have visited This restaurant several times and have yet to be disappointed. Consistently great food and service to match!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I spent a weekend at the Kimpton Schofield, and we decided to grab lunch at this restaurant. The food was amazing, and the drinks were fantastic as well. Staff was extremely helpful and upbeat, and the service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Take this review with a grain of salt - as I may be a bit biased.  I'm a big fan of the Kimpton hotel chain to begin with, and my first experience with Parkers was a semi-magical night out with friends after touring Heinins for some supplies for a 2 day vacation in town.  It was late, a light snow was falling, we came out of Heinins hungry, looked across the street and there it was.  I  can tell you it wasn't just magic that gave us what we all agreed was one of the best dinners in a long time.  We had none of the picky issues I read in some of the other reviews (this is a dinner review, not brunch fyi).  Service was friendly and attentive, wait times were short and the food was outstanding.  Our waiter did mention the Executive Chef was cooking that night - so maybe that had something to do with it.  I won't belabor the point only to say we ordered multiple different drinks, appetizers, entrees and desserts.  Everything was amazing (and I don't use that word much, believe me).  If you haven't tried Parkers out yet, do yourself a favor and give it a go."}
{"text":"Parker's was convenient when we wanted to get brunch relatively quickly while also getting great food. The Korean Chicken and Waffles was incredible and the waffle was as fluffy as a cloud. I was skeptical how the sauce would taste with the waffle but it was amazing. The fruit bowl was also so much better than expected-we received raspberries, blackberries, strawberries and blueberries unlike most fruit bowls that only have melons. We could not recommend this spot more!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks on a Saturday night and what fun! The bartenders were busy but quick to take our order. Both our drinks were fabulous! Well balance, fruity and just delicious. There's also a gorgeous fireplace in the lobby-perfect for snuggling with your sweetie on a cold winter night"}
{"text":"We had walked past Parker's several times and got the impression it would be an old-school, classic Midwestern restaurant but when we finally managed to sit down and eat there Saturday we were delighfully surprised at some of the twists the chef had.  Octopus and bone marrow are two of our favorite appetizers so when we saw grilled octopus with whipped bone marrow ($14) on the menu we jumped on it. The octopus was perfectly tender though there was a pretty high spice level that should have been noted on the menu. But the eye-opening part of the dish was the bite-sized pieces of brioche with what looked like a schmear of butter on it topped with a little pickled onion. Biting into it suddenly gave us the smokey flavor of the marrow and the acid of the onion just as if we had the Flintstone-sized bones split open in front of us.  Jeannene's mundane-sounding Chicken Pot Pie ($22) also was a revelation as the chef again showed skill and imagination. The creamy sauce was there along with the green veggies but instead of the pie-like covering there were several bite-sized puff pastries around the dish and in the middle sat a large piece of chicken that had a charred taste that one does not normally associate with chicken pot pie. All that and some chunks of sausage mixed in definitely had us praising the dish.  I had the pasta bolognese ($23)  -- the bucatini was just how I like it -- not too al dente but yet not very gummy. There was a generous portion of the pork/veal/pancetta mixture and it was quite savory (though someone with a more acute palate might think it too salty).  We had some extra time to kill so we stayed for dessert -- tiramisu that probably had the most mild coffee flavor I've ever had (for me that's a good thing) while the creamy texture was spot on and the drizzled chocolate added a note of richness."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early, light dinner before going out. The Young Green salad with prosciutto, egg, and goat cheese was delicious and a good sized portion. The Hungry Man's burger and fries looked respectable and he was satisfied with the quality. We had an issue with a dirty water glass and the wait staff handled it with grace."}
{"text":"We had very good service. It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night. Cocktails are very good. Cauliflower soup is amazing. We tried the scallops, fried pork chops, and chicken pot pie. All three were good and pretty heavy. My only negative would be a bit salty overall. Other than that everything was very good."}
{"text":"Fabulous evening, attentive service by Spencer, added a bit of entertainment to the evening.  Began with a cauliflower and curry soup, different, but nice.  The filet was a tad undercooked but acceptable and flavorful.  Cocktail menu was an adventure, enjoyed the Old Fashion.  Would/ will go back, need to work my way through the drink menu."}
{"text":"We went here on Christmas Eve and had a pleasant time.  I liked my vegetarian options just fine: a tasty roasted tomato soup and a small but chewy appetizer of potato and cheese pierogi.  My companion's deconstructed chicken pot pie was Ok, and my other companion liked her cauliflower soup just fine.    The service was good, although our server kept telling us how tired she was (I have no doubt that was true), and that the menu was outdated (there were several cocktails and sodas listed that were no longer available.) Also, the valet had cars parked in the valet lane, making it impossible for the handicapped person in our party to get into the restaurant easily.  The decor is drab and grey, and not particularly interesting for a wintry Cleveland night."}
{"text":"In a word... OUTSTANDING! Just like their Avon Lake location. Perfectly executed and amazing everything from location to food to scotch selection to wine selection to service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Happy hour was great. Everyone loved the sliders! Also had dinner and breakfast here. The porterhouse steaks were huge and delicious. Gnocchi was good but not great. Had the salmon the next day which was spectacular. My son had the Korean fried chicken and waffles and really liked the combination of sweet and spicy. Service was great and everyone was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This is such a great spot. It's a well-run restaurant that does all courses expertly, and My God, the location is stellar. One of my favorite places, real-estate/location-wise, in Cleveland. The huge windows out on the main intersection of downtown provide a neat side-event.  Parker's is a great place to go for after-anything-downtown drinks or a nightcap. Easy place to get picked up by an UBER or Lyft, too.  This review is short and sweet, I suppose, but I can assure anyone reading that we enjoy the heck out of this place."}
{"text":"Had a super tasty dinner and very prompt service. Had the Cleveland recess to drink, was amazing. For appetizers, we tried everything as a big group. I think the chicken wings and octopus were my favorite but hard to choose.   For entree, went with the Scottish Salmon. It was a blend of crispy outside and tender inside that I've never had before. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious and Josh took amazing care of us! I took my mom out for a nice dinner before the opera and she loved everything about Parker's Downtown! We split the Cauliflower Soup - amazing! The split portion was perfect as a appetizer.   My mom got the pork chop and as soon as her first piece entered her mouth she stopped and just said Wow! She did it was the best pork chop she's ever had! The Brussels sprouts were beyond delicious too! I had the 8oz filet with truffle sauce - I was a little confused because I thought it would be served on the steak but it was on the side! It was all very good and I used almost the entire dip.   A very nice dining experience!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 8.   Drinks & food were good.  Everyone had a steak or halibut. Appetizers were good, we had cheese plate, octopus, and calamari.  Only thing is that they give you very little of an app so it was hard to divvy out for 8 people even with 3 apps!  The server made it sound like it would be fine, but everyone literally took like 2 rings of calamari and a bite of bread with cheese and we cut the octopus up but still only a bite per person.  We had to ask for more bread since their was cheese left and no bread, and I mean we had cut the bread into tiny pieces and it went around once.  Also, we were celebrating a graduation.  I had made the reservations a few weeks in advance.  However at the last minute we had decided to order a special cake from a bakery.  I called the restaurant the day before to ask if it was ok that we bring our 8\" round cake.  The girl indicated that they will charge an extra $25 if we bring our own cake since they sell desserts.  So we decided fine we will just go back home to enjoy our cake.  After our dinner the server asked if we wanted dessert menus.  My hubby said no thanks we have a cake at home, to which she awkwardly ignored and said, \"so do u still want to look at dessert menus\"....I have been to many upscale restaurants that are happy to accommodate you if you bring your own cake and they do not charge anything extra.  I get that you sell desserts, but you don't have a special made cake personalized for people celebrating something.  I didn't have to bring my party to your restaurant and drop $460 before tip. And to be so nit picky as to charge more for a party to bring their own cake is a bit absurd in my book.   Next time I'll plan better in advance and bring my parties to places that are more accommodating.  It's not like it was packed in there and we'd take up valuable 30 minutes eating cake.  Matter of fact, we were the only table in there the entire time! We were in on a Sunday At 5.  2 people at the bar and a group of 4 walked in when we left."}
{"text":"This is a SOLID happy hour. Go here. This made It into our limited, very picky rotation.   Order the wings. DO IT. They are smoked for 4 hours before they are fried and come on a bed of blue cheese sauce. We got the cheese board as well and It was good. Main bartender knows his stuff and is making great drinks. Really good atmosphere. We'll be regulars. This place is great can't believe we waited so long to stop in."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Parker's for the first time for Valentine's Day dinner. The service was excellent even though we were having a early dinner. Our waitress was sweet and helpful as well. We started with the Calamari and Pierogies for hot apps and they were amazing! It came out the kitchen pretty fast too! I ended up getting the 16 oz Ribeye and my girlfriend got the Gnoochi. The steak was cooked perfectly at medium rare and it just melted in your mouth as you eat a bite of it. The gnoochi was great as well! So flavorful. Definitely recommend this place as nice date option for you and your partner."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Parker's last night for dinner before the Cavs game (game time 7:30pm on a Saturday). We made reservations via Open Table in the mid-afternoon, and our seating options were 5:00pm or 6:45pm. We normally wouldn't eat so early, but we took the 5:00pm seating because we really wanted to try this place.   When we arrived, we were greeted warmly by the two young hostesses. The bar had a handful of people sitting at it, as did the lounge area directly behind the hostess stand. We were offered a seat by the front windows facing the street or a table in the lounge area. We opted for the table with the windows. The vibe of this place seemed trendy, but not overly so. We definitely felt underdressed in our Cavs gear, but we usually don't go fine dining in t-shirts and jeans. Our server, Michael, was great and arrived at our table promptly with dinner and drink menus. He was extremely friendly and assisted with menu selections.   I had a glass of the Dante Cab, and my husband had \"The Professor\" (Bulleit Rye, Smoked Lapsang Souchong Tea, Toasted Clove, Peychaud's Bitters, Orange Peel, Star Anise, Laphroaig Mist). I'm not a huge mixed drink fan - but my husband is - and he was very satisfied with his drink and the drink menu itself. Before we ordered food, he said he'd like to return another time just to try more cocktails!   I started with the cauliflower soup (with king crab, tarragon, curry oil), which I thought was outstanding. The portion was larger than I expected (this is not a small cup of soup!); however, I licked the (large) bowl clean! The soup was a perfect temperature and texture - warm and velvety on a snowy night, and the crab and curry oil made elevated the soup from what could have been a run-of-the-mill starter. My husband started with Parker's Wedge (bacon, tomato, egg, onion straws, blue cheese), which he also enjoyed. The salad was presented a little more deconstructed than most wedge salads I have seen, but it looked delicious. My husband cleared his plate.   For my main meal I had the shrimp and grits (chorizo, pepper conserva, 45 minute egg, aged cheddar). After my first bite, my very first thought was, \"this tastes like breakfast\". The sausage is crumbled within the cheesy, cheddar grits, and the dish is topped with an egg. It was absolutely delicious - do not get me wrong - but definitely tasted like an upscale brunch item.   Oddly enough, it does not appear to be served on their brunch menu!? Parkers should definitely consider adding this! In any case, I again cleaned my plate.   My husband had the pork shoulder (collard greens, sticky rice, adobo). At first glance, I was like, \"Wow, that pork looks DRY and that rice looks BLAND\". Based on appearance, I thought the shrimp and grits \"looked\" better. My husband; however, ensured me the dish was moist and flavorful. I took a bite, and agreed. He ate every bite (except the one I stole).  As my husband and I have a half-season of Cavs tickets, I'm sure we'll return to Parkers - if not for another full sit-down meal, at least for the drinks. We've heard some outstanding things about their burger, and are anxious to try on a future visit. Additionally, we found out valet parking is $12 with a receipt. Had we known this ahead of time, we would have totally valet parked instead of paying the $20 for special event parking for the game!"}
{"text":"Read a few reviews before trying it for myself and was pleasantly surprised. Reserved a table for Valentine's Day and we were both impressed with the food and overall experience.  I recommend the ribeye as a main. The calamari as a starter was also very good."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here for some time. We were downtown at an event and met up with my son for Brunch on a Saturday.  Classy, but not High Brow, understated elegance with a bit of what I call a \"frou frou\" menu to offer. So if you are a steak and potato kind of person you will need to expand your options. That said, the service is excellent and I think they would do their best to accommodate any dining request you might have. My husband had been here for lunch and was drooling for a repeat meal of the NY strip steak and frites he had, (they were not on the brunch menu), the chef was happy to comply and cook up his favorite. We also requested a salmon dish for my son's vegetarian girlfriend and they did a marvelous job accommodating, she loved it. I ordered the pirogies with pear and creme fraiche which were delightful.  Full bar service, a great view out the front window and you can sit in the Kimpton Schofield hotel lobby at their ultra modern \"rustic\" fireplace and enjoy a cocktail and some conversation.  I soooo want to return and stay at the hotel.  Staff their was dripping with eagerness to serve. I love a place that delivers exactly what you expect for the price point and this place does!"}
{"text":"We visited this place while visiting Cleveland. The service was great and attentive. The food was amazing! My husband got the aged rib eye and loved every bit of it. I had a bite and it was truly good. I ordered the young green salad and the pasta bolganese. The salad was so very good and large. I ate every bit of it. The salad filled me up so I only had a few bites of the pasta. It was also incredible. We would definitely visit here again when in town!"}
{"text":"Husband and I had date night here last night. Cool spot, good food, noisy ambiance.  Parking: $20 for valet, $12 with receipt.  Hostesses: less than enthused to assist us when we arrived. No smiles. Making chit chat amongst themselves.  Wait staff: pleasant, knowledgeable, but slow Food: grilled prosciutto and basil wrapped shrimp was good, homemade tartar sauce good, but salty. Shrimp and grits was on point. Hubs loved the salmon entree.  Drinks: The drinks alone would have me coming back. They're great, traditional cocktails. The drinks aren't cheap, but I don't mind paying the price for a great craft cocktail.  We'll definitely be back to Parker's!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for excellent fine crafted cocktails ingredients house made ! We Loved their Mac & cheese & the mussels appy definitely would order more next time"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch, it was ok. Cauliflower soup was pretty good. Caesar salad was fine, nothing to get excited about. I added grilled chicken to the salad and it was very thin and dry. Service was good, overall a nice looking, clean place.  Lowdown: just fine if you are in a jam but nothing special."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Parker's with a coworker while exploring the Kimpton hotel as a possible venue place. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and it was a very good dish. The sauce had a hint of spice and was very flavorful. It was a good sized lunch portion. The menu was eclectic and had a lot to offer.  The street level location with large glass windows was also great for people watching.  In my opinion it is more than just a hotel restaurant."}
{"text":"The appetizers we're fried Gouda, calamari, meatballs and octopus. Outstanding! I had the Walleye which was excellent! Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner with my boyfriend at Parker's. Parker's has a beautiful, modern interior design. The drinks were GREAT! And the food was even better. I would compare my steak to the quality and flavor at Red Steakhouse. It was simply delicious. The service was remarkable and I even met and chatted with the manager. This is a wonderful new establishment and I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Stayed at the Kimpton and had dinner at Parkers Downtown with another couple.  Cocktails and cheese plate were good. I got the aged New York Strip steak and was underwhelmed. The steak was on the low end of average. This steak, along with all other steaks on the menu touted the various ageing times wet and dry. After dinner I looked again at menu. None of their steaks are listed as prime beef, just aged. Their steaks range from $38 to $65 yet no claim of prime. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"I've been back since opening day several times and loved the food every time. My most recent visit was no exception. The soft product side of Parker's though could still use some work. The host started us off at dinner time with lunch menus and the server failed to notice until I said something.   Some things have changed since I've been here, but I'm so glad the cocktail menu wasn't one of them. The Murray Hill is still on the menu and is still amazing - even the smell of it.   For an appetizer I tried the Smoked White Fish Spread for the first time. It was served hot with warm sourdough bread. I'm not sure all that went into the spread, but it was a good portion size and very tasty. It had a slight baked top and was a great starter. Even though we were at a dining room table we got the $12 app for half price owing to happy hour (3-6p).  The Chicken Pot Pie entrée is deconstructed in that the pie part is formed with four small puff pastries placed on the plate. The sauce of the pie is a white sausage gravy. There were small pieces of sausage and mushrooms in the sauce. The chicken serving was large. It was served with the skin on, but if fell right off.    The salmon was just as good as I remembered it and it appeared the portion size may have improved from when I first had it. It was perfectly cooked and simply, but excellently seasoned.   The bread pudding may be the best I've had anywhere. It was served warm with ice cream with caramel sauce on it. On this occasion the bread pudding was a bit burnt on the outside. This may be the first time I've been professionally served a burnt dessert; one that truly should never have left the kitchen or been delivered by an observant server. Those blackened edges aside however, the flavor was still amazing."}
{"text":"Service definitely lacked on my first trip to Parker's inside the Shofield Hotel.  The hostess was sitting down even though we were right in the middle of the brunch time slot.  Our server kept disappearing (I believe he was working the bar too). My friend dropped her knife and was never brought a new one.  Their table water tasted like hose. We had to purchase a bottle of Panna.  Food was fine, I may come back for dinner and the hopes that service at that time is better.  The mussels we had as an appetizer were pretty standard with a nice broth. My friend's wedge salad was fine.  My asian chicken and waffles weren't something I would rush to get again.  The waffle was good, the sauce for the chicken had a soy sauce base and was fairly salty, though not really in a bad way.  More of a strange flavor pairing than anything."}
{"text":"Don't bother if you have food allergies or follow a particular diet...sadly the chef refuses to substitute/accommodate and there was literally nothing I could eat \"as is\" on the menu...we left after a cocktail in search of dinner elsewhere."}
